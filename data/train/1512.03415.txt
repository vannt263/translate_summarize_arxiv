    "one way to mitigate such detrimental effects is by proportionally increasing the strength of the dominant ( desired ) dynamics by increasing the ratio @xmath40 , e.g. by increasing the transmissivity of the output port of the cavity or the qubit - cavity coupling . in other words , increasing the correlated decay moves the dynamics towards the left side of the graph .",
    "however , physical constraints impose bounds on achievable @xmath4 .",
    "a complementary and more practical solution is optimizing the dynamics to take into account the form of these deleterious effects .",
    "while the intrinsic loss operators act primarily by decreasing the purity of the entangled state , these rates can be reduced to greatest order by making dissipation out of the ( approximately pure ) steady - state more energetically unfavourable , that is , by essentially causing destructive interference in the transient population outside of the subspace .",
    "of course , as seen from the approximate solution , increasing the detuning between qubits ( relative to rabi frequency ) will also incorporate more of the ground state into the stead - state superposition , and so there is a trade - off between increasing purity and decreasing the ground - state component",

    "loss in such a long - distance architecture is much more troublesome than in the single cavity case because the single - qubit loss and correlated - decay are proportional , and we therefore can not simply increase one over the other . furthermore , loss is expected to grow exponentially with distance and is a primary impediment to remote entanglement proposals .    for such unidirectional transmission the effective dynamics are compactly obtained from the slh composition formulae for cascaded systems ,    [ eqcascadedcavities ] @xmath60    such that @xmath61+\\sum_j \\d[l_j]\\rho$ ] . in practice ,",
    "directionality is enforced by placing a circulator in the optical path to prevent ( i.e.  destroy ) back - reflection from the second cavity , similarly to what is done for measurement - based approaches  @xcite .",

    "in essence , we find that the extreme loss out of the first qubit can be counteracted by decreasing the cavity decay and increasing the rabi strength , such that lost population is pumped back into the excited state . meanwhile the second cavity is strongly coupled and weakly pumped , such that at least some of the population from the first qubit finds its way into the second qubit and stays there ( specifically , whenever no field leaks out of the transmission channel ) .",

    "whereas including a circulator retains the important properties of our solution , such as persistence , determinism , and robustness against losses , there are at least two reasons for not including it .",
    "the first is that the circulator element will be imperfect and decrease the transmissivity of the channel , although efforts exist to create new designs that minimize such losses  @xcite .",
    "the second is that allowing for bi - directional transmission means that a photon will travel on average @xmath79 times through the waveguide and therefore it will become harder to distinguish from which qubit the information that leaks out is coming from .",
    "this means that the mixing / ground state contribution in the steady state can in principle be less pronounced .",
    "when the transmission channel is allowed to flow in both directions , the system can be modeled as two unidirectional systems forming a loop together .",
    "the internal scattering edges from one cavity to the other in the slh representation correspond to beam - splitter elements @xmath80 while output edges correspond to @xmath81 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the adjacency matrix for internal edges taking the output of each cavity to a beamsplitter and into the other cavity , with indices @xmath84 and @xmath85 corresponding to internal and external edges , respectively .",

    "an analytic solution for optimizing the concurrence is attained for @xmath93 , @xmath10 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "note the dependence in this case of the parameters on @xmath91 , rather than @xmath96 as was the case for the cascaded setup , indicating loss of purity that happens quadratically slower so that there is now a greater resilience to loss .",

    ", the optimal concurrence is attained for e.g.  @xmath93 , @xmath98 , @xmath99=@xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "interestingly , in this high loss limit , the bi - directional architecture does not produce quantitatively higher concurrence than the cascaded setup , owing to a similar strategy that does not use the symmetry of the setup . for high loss , it is once again advantageous to choose a highly asymmetric solution where the second cavity is not driven but strongly coupled to the transmission channel so that any photons that do make it to the second cavity consequently excite the second qubit .",
    "the numerical optimization results are also plotted ( in purple ) in fig .",
    "[ figcvsloss ] , once again showing the near optimality over a wide range of the analytical formulas . clearly the bi - directional case outperforms the cascaded setup over a wide range .",
    "we now discuss the robustness with respect to a number of aspects of experiment .",
    "the first aspect is global convergence of the protocol regardless of the initial state and final time .",
    "this means that there is no need to precisely calibrate or cool to the initial state to produce the correct final state .",
    "there is also no need to precisely know how long it will take for a wavepacket to travel or to synchronize arrival times or generation of signals .",
    "moreover , the robustness is also towards transient perturbations away from the steady - state , since any temporary action on the state will be subsequently undone and the optimal state restabilized .     as a function of deviations ( with 10% maximum ) from expected value of rabi frequencies @xmath102 and mean inverse correlation time of the error .",
    "the deviations are chosen anti - symmetric for the two qubits ( worst - case error ) .",
    "the system is simulated for the single - cavity master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) with eq .",
    "[ eqt1t2 ] set to @xmath103 . ]    to see this , we can quantify how robust the experiment is against various frequencies and forms of noise sources .",
    "for example , we quantify the effect of extra noise on the control ports of the qubits .",
    "we model this as random telegraph noise  @xcite on top of the rabi frequencies which is chosen to be anti - symmetric between the controls to reflect the worst case ( the symmetric case is almost immune to noise ) .",
    "[ figfreq ] shows the effect on the steady concurrence of different amplitudes and inverse correlation times of this form of noise .",
    "indeed we see that for very slow noise there is some dropoff in concurrence compared to the target value of 97% ( the error roughly doubles for a 2% drift / miscalibration in the rabi frequency ) while there is almost no effect for fast noise .",
    "while there is expected to be little drift in the parameters on the scale of the convergence time , if the stabilization is allowed to run unattended for long intervals of time , there can be small shifts in certain parameters .",
    "moreover , certain parameters such as the cavity decay rate can be non - trivial to measure , so small calibration errors may arise . in fig .",
    "[ figcalib ] , we plot the concurrence as a function of deviations from the optimal parameter values for both decay rates of the qubits . we see that there is indeed robustness against this parameter , with miscalibrations up to around 10% being tolerable when the drift is anti - symmetric , and almost complete robustness when the shift is symmetric for the two qubits . robustness to qubit frequency drift is even greater , with about 20% deviation being tolerable .     as a function of deviation ( 30% maximum ) from expected values of qubit decay rates @xmath21 and @xmath22 for a single cavity , with other parameters the same as in fig .",
    "[ figfreq ] . ]",
    "another significant robustness of the experiment comes in the context of the design parameters of the experiment . while the decay rates and detunings of the qubits can be tuned by shifting the qubit frequencies ( e.g. by magnetic fluxes or stark shifts ) , this is typically not even required .",
    "as discussed in the previous sections , a very wide range or combination of experimental parameters can produce near - optimal concurrence for the losses present , simply by changing the frequency and amplitude of the qubit drives .",
    "for example , for asymmetric decay @xmath104 and large 40% loss , it is still possible to robustly achieve 80% concurrence with the appropriate driving fields . finding the optimal value",
    "can be performed straightforwardly either analytically or numerically as above , or during the experiment using simple gradient - free optimization routines such as nelder mead  @xcite or quasi - newton methods with finite different gradient estimation  @xcite .    while the concurrence is a preferred figure of merit ,",
    "we obtain similar fidelities for overlap fidelity of the steady state with the singlet bell state .",
    "for example , choosing an expected bidirectional waveguide loss of @xmath105 , the overlap fidelity with the bell state is still @xmath106 while concurrence is @xmath107 .",
    "because we have not optimized for this metric , this figures can likely be further improved by sacrificing some coherence for more population inside the odd excitation number manifold .",
    "although the parameters used are dimensionless and thus work at various timescales , they are also grounded experimentally and are well within the range of typical parameters .",
    "for example , for contemporary circuit - qed architectures  @xcite , cavity decays ( @xmath28 ) and detunings ( @xmath17 ) in the low mhz , qubit - cavity couplings ( @xmath108 ) and rabi frequencies ( @xmath109 ) on the order of 10 - 100  mhz are accessible , and would permit convergence times on the order of @xmath110 or about 100  ns , much faster than typical coherence times . provided the steady - state and parameters are appropriately modified to account for the extra losses ( as described in the single cavity case ) , a purcell to intrinsic decay ratio @xmath111 would affect concurrences by @xmath112 , with steady - state concurrence corresponding to losses in the transmission line according to fig .",
    "[ figcvsloss ] .    in the optical domain ,",
    "similar couplings and convergence rates could be achieved with cavity - qed using trapped atoms  @xcite .",
    "increasing the strengths of vacuum couplings , rabi frequencies , detunings , and cavity decays to the @xmath113  ghz range , e.g. coupling nv centres to photonic crystal cavities @xcite , would permit convergence within nanoseconds .",
    "once again , for experiments with @xmath111 , nearly all intrinsic loss could be counteracted to about @xmath114 , while a more conservative estimate of @xmath115 would still permit a baseline concurrence of @xmath116 , both well within the range needed for e.g. entanglement distillation .",
    "finally , we also consider how well the protocol performs for large distances between the cavities .",
    "since photon loss in the channel ( measured in db ) will be proportional to the distance traveled , we have optimized the concurrence for various amounts of loss . for a conservative estimate of 0.1db loss per meter of microwave coaxial cable  @xcite",
    ", we expect there still to be considerable entanglement when microwave cavities are tens of meters apart . for optical waveguides loss rates",
    "are expected to be even better ( @xmath117db / km )  @xcite so that steady - state entanglement ought to be achievable across multi - kilometer separations .",
    "the protocol we have presented is very simple and so lends itself well to generalization and extension .",
    "one aspect that can be readily generalized is the relative phase of the entangled state . by changing the relative phase of the qubit decay amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( and accordingly also the relative phases of the rabi controls ) it is possible to obtain any entangled state in the single - excitation subspace",
    "this can be tuned by changing the relative real and imaginary parts of @xmath118 through the cavity - to - qubit detuning ( see e.g. eq .  ) or by introducing phase shifters in the transmission channels . for bi - directional decay ,",
    "both of these allow for calibration of the inter - cavity phase @xmath119 as well .",
    "we can also consider whether the protocol can be further generalized to be more robust to transmission loss .",
    "as far as markovian two - qubit implementations are concerned , the answer appears to be no .",
    "we have optimized over general lindbladian operators of the form @xmath120}\\rho + { \\mathcal{d}[\\eta\\kappa_1\\hat o_1+\\kappa_2\\hat o_2]}\\rho\\ ] ] and no solution was found better than the upper bound given in fig .",
    "[ figcvsloss ] , indicating the relative optimality of our solution , at least for markovian solutions .",
    "of course solutions that use auxiliary degrees of freedom ( such as in entanglement distillation  @xcite ) can in principle produce higher concurrences at the cost of a larger hilbert space .    including non - markovian effects",
    "is also a direction of future research , for example using the method presented in ref .",
    "this is not necessary in the uni - directional case since the only effect of the transmission channel is to delay its eventual environmental measurement , such that the first and second qubit are correlated instead at different times ( eventually reaching a common entangled steady - state ) . for bi - directional decay",
    ", the state of the qubits may change between different reflections of the light off the cavities , and so the condition of the slh formalism that @xmath121 is formally needed ; but in practice , short - time transient effects do not pose much issue ( as seen in fig .  [ figfreq ] ) such that the present results are expected to hold even entering into the non - markovian regime .",
    "moreover , only the convergence rate and not the steady - state itself can be affected by non - markovianity , since in the steady - state there are no memory effects .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider to what extent the protocol gets around the need for error correction by syndrome measurement and feedback .",
    "for the regimes considered here this has a drastic effect on the ultimate fidelity of the steady state by avoiding measurement inefficiency and long feedback times .",
    "however , such  error - correction \" is only to largest order and it remains an open question whether one can further increase the measurement - less steady - state fidelity by increasing the hilbert space , for example , or whether more conventional correction using measurement ( as in typical entanglement distillation protocols ) is still eventually needed .",
    "the protocol presented here also lends itself straightforwardly to scaling to multiple pairs of qubits .",
    "since each qubit pair must operate at a common drive frequency to interact and entangle , this greatly avoids crosstalk between pairs operating at different frequencies .",
    "such a schematic is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] d. here , many pairs can operate simultaneously at their own frequency along a common transmission channel , allowing for use in more complex protocols .",
    "one such protocol is entanglement distillation  @xcite , which would allow further improvement on the already significant steady - state concurrences achievable here , with no need to synchronize different pairs .",
    "thus , entangling simultaneous pairs across a common waveguide in a deterministic and persistent way could also be a boon to quantum repeater technology , where unsynchronized low - probability entanglement via postselection might run into scaling problems .",
    "finally , generalizing to multi - qubit entanglement using a single - excitation subspace is also possible and should straightforwardly follow the same logic .",
    "clearly , the operator @xmath122}\\rho$ ] will have a generalized @xmath123 state with appropriate phase factors ( summing to zero ) as a dark state , and introducing near - resonant rabi drives with the same phase factors can render the state unique and globally attractive .",
    "studying this problem more in - depth is a direction of future research and may benefit from consideration of  on chip \" architectures such as the atom nanophotonic waveguide interface recently employed in  @xcite .",
    "we propose an entanglement generation and stabilisation protocol for a pair of qubits driven by single - photon transitions and interacting with a cavity mode , using only the resource of nonlocal correlated spontaneous decay from a common cavity mode or transmission line .",
    "the qubits can either be in the same cavity or in distant , separate cavities with either cascaded or bidirectional coupling .",
    "the technique is robust to a variety of experimental considerations and does not require coherent control ( aside from constant driving of single photon transitions ) , measurement , collection , or feedback .",
    "the protocol has potential applicability both for short - range , high grade entanglement and long - range but finite entanglement which can be distilled via other protocols to a higher - grade concurrence .",
    "the former is of tangible interest because global attractivity of the target state ensures that all initial and perturbed states converge to the steady - state , effectively amounting to build - in error - correction , without the need for complex pulse sequences or error - syndrome measurements and relays . due to its resilience towards large fractions of information loss",
    ", the protocol also enables long - distance stabilisation , which is generally very challenging as coherent control and measurement feedback loops become prohibitively costly , making environment - assisted stabilisation more advantageous .",

    "<S> we present a scheme for generating robust and persistent entanglement between qubits that do not interact and that are separated by a long and lossy transmission channel , using markovian reservoir engineering . </S>",
    "<S> the proposal uses only the correlated decay into the common channel of remotely separated , driven single - photon qubit transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this simple scheme is generic and applicable to various experimental implementations , including circuit and cavity qed , with little experimental overhead compared with methods requiring dynamic control , initialization , measurement , or feedback . in addition to avoiding these inefficiencies , the simple protocol is highly robust against noise , miscalibration , and loss in the channel . </S>",
    "<S> we find high quality solutions over a wide range of parameters and show that the optimal strategy reflects a transition from ballistic to diffusive photon transmission , going from symmetrically and coherently driving a common steady state to asymmetrically absorbing photons that are emitted from one qubit by the second . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis of the role of the transmission channel shows that allowing bi - directional decay drastically increases indistinguishability and thereby quadratically suppresses infidelity .    </S>",
    "<S> deterministically generating remote steady - state entanglement is of fundamental interest for ongoing developments of quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> applications include quantum cryptography , quantum networks , entanglement distillation , scalable quantum computation , and distributed quantum computing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much akin to how operational amplifiers have removed many of the timing , calibration , and variability issues in classical circuit technology , offering stabilised entanglement on - demand can serve a similar purpose for quantum technologies , alleviating the need for complex and often inefficient measurement , initialization , photon creation , photon collection , or travel - time synchronization processes . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we propose a scheme for on - demand deterministic generation of remote entanglement that employs reservoir engineering to autonomously arrive at a high - fidelity entangled steady - state solution of qubits in distinct cavities . </S>",
    "<S> perturbation away from the desired steady - state is self - healing due to the nonlocal relaxation back - action , and therefore naturally robust against noise in ways that pulse and measurement - based generation of entanglement can not be .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of theoretical schemes have been proposed for realizing deterministic steady - state entanglement over short distances , e.g. , within a single cavity  @xcite or between spatially separated qubits assuming zero or minimal losses in communication  @xcite , and several recent experimental demonstrations have realized above threshold steady - state entanglement , although with limited fidelities  @xcite . medium - distance entanglement has also been studied theoretically  @xcite and realized experimentally in  @xcite . however , achieving even postselected , transient entanglement over truly long distances is considerably more challenging , due to the effects of losses . to date long - distance entanglement has only been realized transiently with very low postselection probability with the use of measurements to postselect entangled states of electron spins  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose an alternative to generate steady - state entanglement between remotely separated qubits . </S>",
    "<S> our approach relies on generating a contractive map for distant objects using markovian reservoir engineering  @xcite in the presence of a ( highly ) lossy transmission channel . the convergence to an entangled steady - state is obtained via the construction of a rank - one decoherence - free subspace  @xcite ( dfs ) and the indistinguishability of the qubits with respect to the destructive environmental interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the absence of any decay from the two spatially separated objects , this weak ( unobserved ) measurement projects continuously onto the dfs , essentially constituting an interaction - free measurement  @xcite of the nonlocal state , while the presence of transient leaked information destroys population from any other states , rendering the desired state globally attractive  @xcite . when imperfections in the system are included , this dfs is smoothly varied as a function of the fraction of additional lost information ( e.g. , in the communication channel ) , but the coherence of the entangled state can be retained to greatest order by counteracting the dissipative dynamics with constant local unitary drives . we constructively show that these local unitaries in combination with the nonlocal backaction of the environmental interaction are sufficient for global attraction towards a nonlocal state and error correction of perturbation away from this state even in the presence of overwhelming loss .    </S>",
    "<S> the current proposal differs from previous work in three respects . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) while previous proposals have focused on sidebands and/or two - mode squeezing @xcite to generate entanglement , we use only two - level systems with single - photon transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the number of decay channels for the qubits and in this respect is more similar to probabilistic measurment schemes which have a single ( here unobserved ) measurement channel . </S>",
    "<S> reducing the number of drives also simplifies experimental overhead , calibration , and obviates the need for phase - matching between lasers . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) we study the transmission channel between the qubits and its direct effect on the indistinguishability of the two qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we show that not enforcing directionality in the decay channel drastically increases indistinguishability in the low - loss regime , thereby quadratically suppressing infidelity . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) we show that while channel loss can exponentially reduce fidelity of protocols that work ideally under low - loss conditions , many other solutions exist that incorporate these additional dissipation effects . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions fall into two broad categories corresponding to two regimes for the scattered outgoing photons , namely ballistic ( many cavity reflections ) or diffusive , with solution parameters varying from symmetric to highly asymmetric along the transition .        </S>",
    "<S> the experimental protocol we present below is inherently capable of deterministically and persistently generating long - range above - threshold entanglement while being robust to a large amount of noise or miscalibration in the system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a nonlocal , weak , destructive measurement interaction ( which remains unobserved ) , and always - on , constant local rotation operator . </S>",
    "<S> the destructive measurement here corresponds to a correlated atomic decay operator  @xcite , which has multiple dark states , including a bell state and the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the rotation operators is to remove the degeneracy in the dark states by acting trivially only on the desired bell state , while rotating the other states amongst themselves . </S>",
    "<S> because the dark state is unique , all initial states must converge asymptotically onto this state  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : loss - less ] introduces our mechanism and formalism to generate nonlocal states . </S>",
    "<S> applications are given for a single - cavity setup ( section [ sec : single ] ) , cascaded cavities ( section [ sec : cascade ] ) , and multiple reflections off both cavities ( section [ sec : bidir ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is applicable to both microwave and optical domain cavity quantum electrodynamics , using atomic or electrical ( superconducting ) qubits . </S>",
    "<S> section [ sec : robustness ] discusses in detail the robustness of the protocol , while section [ sec : optim ] discusses optimality of the protocol and scalability . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude and give an outlook in section [ sec : conc ] . </S>"
