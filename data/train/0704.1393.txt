    "blue straggler stars ( bss ) appear brighter and bluer than the turn - off ( to ) point along an extension of the main sequence in color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of stellar populations .",

    "bss are thought to be objects that have increased their initial mass during their evolution , and two main scenarios have been proposed for their formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the _ collisional scenario _ suggests that bss are the end - products of stellar mergers induced by collisions ( col - bss ) , while in the _ mass - transfer _ scenario bss form by the mass - transfer activity between two companions in a binary system ( mt - bss ) , possibly up to the complete coalescence of the two stars @xcite .",
    "hence , understanding the origin of bss in stellar clusters provides valuable insight both on the binary evolution processes and on the effects of dynamical interactions on the ( otherwise normal ) stellar evolution .",
    "the mt formation scenario has by recently received further support by high - resolution spectroscopic observations , which detected anomalous carbon and oxygen abundances on the surface of a number of bss in 47 tuc @xcite .",

    "apart from @xmath3cen where mass segregation processes have not yet played a major role in altering the initial bss distribution , the bss are always highly concentrated in the cluster central regions . moreover , in m  3 , 47  tuc , ngc  6752 , and m  5 the bss fraction decreases at intermediate radii and rises again in the outskirsts of the clusters , yielding a _ bimodal _ distribution .",
    "preliminary evidences of such a bimodality have been found also in m  55 by @xcite .",
    "recent dynamical simulations @xcite have been used to interpret the observed trends and have shown that a significant fraction ( @xmath4% ) of col - bss is required to account for the observed bss central peaks .",
    "in addition , a fraction of 20 - 40% mt - bss is needed to reproduce the outer increase observed in these clusters .",
    "the case of @xmath2cen is reproduced by assuming that the bss population in this cluster is composed entirely of mt - bss .",
    "these results demonstrate that detailed studies of the bss radial distribution within gcs are very powerful tools for better understanding the bss formation channels and for probing the complex interplay between dynamics and stellar evolution in dense stellar systems .    in this paper we present multi - wavelength observations of ngc  1904 .",

    "however , we emphasize that if a rising peripheral bss frequency is absent ( as in the case of ngc  1904 ) our simple approach can not distinguish between bss created by mt ( and then segregated into the cluster core by the dynamical friction ) and col - bss created by collisions inside the core .    on the other hand ,",
    "the negligible fraction of peripheral mt - bss found in ngc  1904 is in agreement with the quite large value of the radius of avoidance estimated for this cluster ( @xmath128 ) , which indicates that all the heavy stars ( binaries ) within this radial distance have had enough time to sink to the core and are therefore not expected in the cluster outskirts .",
    "such a radial distance corresponds to @xmath129 , i.e. , it represents a significant fraction of the cluster extension ( only 1% of the cluster light is contained between @xmath122 and @xmath114 ) , and hence only a small fraction of the massive objects are expected to be unaffected by the dynamical friction ) . in all the other studied cases , @xmath122 is significantly smaller : @xmath130 @xcite . in turn",
