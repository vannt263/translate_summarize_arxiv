    "there has been much interest in traversable wormholes since the important morris - thorne article @xcite .",
    "it was found that these geometries , which act as tunnels from one region of spacetime to another , possess a peculiar property , namely exotic matter , involving a stress - energy tensor that violates the null energy condition @xcite , see also @xcite for a review and references therein .",
    "in fact , traversable wormholes violate all of the pointwise energy conditions and averaged energy conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as",
    "the violation of the energy conditions is a particularly problematic issue @xcite , it is useful to minimize the usage of exotic matter . recently , visser et al @xcite , noting the fact that the energy conditions do not actually quantify the `` total amount '' of energy condition violating matter , developed a suitable measure for quantifying this notion by introducing a `` volume integral quantifier '' . although the null energy and averaged null energy conditions are always violated for wormhole spacetimes , they considered specific examples of spacetime geometries containing wormholes that are supported by arbitrarily small quantities of averaged null energy condition violating matter .    another elegant way of minimizing the usage of exotic matter is to construct a simple class of wormhole solutions using the cut and paste technique @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which the exotic matter is concentrated at the wormhole throat , i.e. , a thin shell wormhole solution .",
    "the surface stresses of the exotic matter were determined by invoking the darmois - israel formalism @xcite .",
    "these thin - shell wormholes are extremely useful as one may apply a stability analysis for the dynamical cases , either by choosing specific surface equations of state @xcite , or by considering a linearized stability analysis around a static solution @xcite , in which a parametrization of the stability of equilibrium is defined , so that one does not have to specify a surface equation of state .",
    "the dynamical analysis in @xcite was generalized by considering solutions with electrical charge @xcite , solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant @xcite , and spherically symmetric dynamical solutions @xcite .",
    "more recently , by using the cut and paste technique , several solutions were analyzed , such as , the dynamics of non rotating cylindrical thin - shell wormholes @xcite , charged thin - shell lorentzian wormholes in dilaton gravity @xcite , five dimensional thin - shell wormholes in einstein - maxwell theory with a gauss - bonnet term @xcite , solutions in higher dimensional einstein - maxwell theory @xcite , thin - shell wormholes associated with global cosmic strings @xcite , solutions in heterotic string theory @xcite , spherical thin - shell wormholes supported by a chaplygin gas @xcite , a new class of thin - shell wormhole by surgically grafting two black hole solutions localized on a three brane in five dimensional gravity in the randall - sundrum scenario @xcite , and spherically symmetric thin - shell wormholes in a string cloud background in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime were also analyzed @xcite .",
    "other wormhole solutions have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "one can go beyond thin shell solutions , and construct wormhole solutions by matching an interior wormhole to an exterior vacuum solution , at a junction surface .",
    "in particular , a thin shell around a traversable wormhole , with generic surface stresses was analyzed in @xcite , a particular case of this , a wormhole with a zero surface energy density and constant redshift function , having been studied in @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis for the plane symmetric case , with a negative cosmological constant , was done in @xcite .",
    "the plane symmetric traversable wormhole is a natural extension of topological black hole solutions with a negative cosmological constant @xcite , upon addition of exotic matter .",
    "these plane symmetric wormholes can be interpreted as domain walls connecting different universes , having planar topology , and upon compactification of one or two coordinates , cylindrical topology or toroidal topology , respectively .",
    "the construction of these wormholes does not alter the topology of the background spacetime ( i.e. , spacetime is not multiply - connected ) , so that these solutions can instead be considered domain walls . thus , in general , these wormhole solutions do not allow time travel .    from recent astronomical observations , it seems that we presently live in a world with a positive cosmological constant , @xmath0 .",
    "however , a spacetime with @xmath1 is also of significant relevance , since it allows a consistent physical interpretation in the context of supergravity and superstring theories @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can enlarge general relativity into a gauged extended supergravity theory , in which the vacuum state has an energy density given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the coupling constant of the theory , and @xmath4 is the gravitational constant .",
    "thus , the vacuum of the theory is described by an anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    "it is important to emphasize that if these theories are correct , they imply that the anti - de sitter spacetime should be considered as a symmetric phase of the theory , although it must have been broken , since we do not presently live in a universe with @xmath1 . in addition , note that anti - de sitter spacetimes have other interesting features : ( i ) they are one of the rare gravitational backgrounds yielding a consistent interaction with massless higher spins , ( ii ) they permit a consistent theory of strings in any dimension , ( iii ) they allow valid definitions for the mass , angular momentum and charge , and ( iv ) it has been conjectured that they has a direct correspondence with conformal field theory on the boundary of that space , the ads - cft conjecture , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "moreover , even with its preference to negative cosmological constant scenarios , string theory can although in a contrived way , produce a landscape of positive cosmological constant universes @xcite , indicating perhaps that one can transit bewteen both signs of the cosmological constant .",
    "so , it is certainly of interest to study astrophysical structures that appear within a positive cosmological constant scenario , as well as to study micro structures that may appear within a negative cosmological constant scenario .",
    "here we analyze wormhole structures within a negative cosmological context . within this context other structures , such as black holes with spherical , toroidal , and hyperbolical topologies ,",
    "have been analyzed ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . by using the cut - and - paste procedure for a thin shell , we construct static and dynamic wormholes by surgically grafting together two spacetimes of plane symmetric vacuum solutions , with planar , cylindrical or toroidal topologies , with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this analysis is displayed in section [ sec : ii ] .",
    "we shall also consider the specific case of static wormhole solutions , and consider several equations of state . in section [ sec : iii ] , we consider a dynamical stability analysis .",
    "in particular , a stability analysis is carried out for the dynamic case by taking into account specific surface equations of state , and a linearized stability analysis around static solutions is also further explored .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "the planar black hole or a black membrane metric is given by @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the inverse of the characteristic length of the system , which here we adopt as given by the negative cosmological constant , i.e. , we put @xmath7 .",
    "the ranges of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the range of the coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 determine the topology of the plane symmetric metric . for the planar case , the topology of the two - dimensional space , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is @xmath16 , with coordinate range @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for the cylindrical case",
    "the topology is @xmath19 , with @xmath17 and @xmath20 . for the toroidal case",
    "the topology is @xmath21 ( i.e. , the torus @xmath22 ) , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a scalar polynomial singularity occurs at @xmath25 , which can be demonstrated through the weyl scalar , given by @xmath26 , where greek indices are spacetime indices , @xmath27 .",
    "it can also be found through the kretschmann scalar , given by @xmath28 , but since the first term is innocuous , the weyl scalar suffices . in particular",
    ", we shall consider the planar topology case , and the analysis considered in this work applies equally well for solutions with toroidal and cylindrical topologies .",
    "note that considering a positive value for @xmath29 , an event horizon occurs at @xmath30 , consequently resulting in a planar black hole solution , or black membrane . considering a negative value for @xmath29",
    ", we verify that no event horizons occur , implying the existence of a singular naked membrane .",
    "a remark is in order here : cylindrically thin - shell wormholes were analyzed in @xcite , which are different to the planar , cylindrical or toroidal topological solutions we analyze , as for our case infinity carries the same topology as the throat    an interesting wormhole solution consists in applying the cut - and - paste construction .",
    "we consider two copies of the black membrane or planar black hole solution , eq .",
    "( [ planarbh ] ) , removing from each spacetime the four - dimensional regions described by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant .",
    "the condition @xmath33 is important to avoid the presence of an event horizon .",
    "the removal of these two regions results in two manifolds , geodesically incomplete , with boundaries given by the following timelike hypersurfaces @xmath34 we now identify these two timelike hypersurfaces , @xmath35 , which results in a manifold , now geodesically complete , with two regions connected by a wormhole .",
    "the throat of the wormhole , i.e. , the junction surface , is situated at @xmath36 , and may be viewed as behaving like a domain wall connecting two universes .",
    "one can then write the intrinsic metric to @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proper time on @xmath36 .    in general terms ,",
    "the position of the junction surface is given by @xmath39 , and the respective @xmath40-velocity is @xmath41 where @xmath38 is the proper time on the surface .",
    "we shall use the darmois - israel formalism to determine the surface stresses at the junction boundary @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic surface stress - energy tensor , @xmath42 , is given by the lanczos equations in the form @xmath43 , where latin indices are intrinsic surface indices which run through @xmath44 .",
    "for notational convenience , the discontinuity in the second fundamental form or extrinsic curvatures is given by @xmath45 .",
    "the second fundamental form is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the unit @xmath40-normal to @xmath36 , and the superscripts @xmath48 correspond to the exterior and interior spacetimes , respectively . the parametric equation for @xmath49",
    "is given by @xmath50 .",
    "the unit @xmath40-normal to @xmath36 is given by @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "applying to our particular case , the position of the junction surface is given by @xmath53 , and the respective @xmath40-velocity is @xmath54 where the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath38 , which is defined as the proper time on @xmath36 .",
    "the unit normal to the junction surface may be determined by eq .",
    "( [ defnormal ] ) or by the contractions , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and is given by @xmath57 considerable simplifications occur due to plane symmetry , namely @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the surface stress - energy tensor may be written in terms of the surface energy density , @xmath59 , and the surface pressure , @xmath60 , as @xmath61 , which taking into account the lanczos equations , reduce to @xmath62 this simplifies the determination of the surface stress - energy tensor to that of the calculation of the non - trivial components of the extrinsic curvature , or the second fundamental form .",
    "therefore , taking into account the metric of eq .",
    "( [ planarbh ] ) and the definition of the second fundamental form , eq .",
    "( [ defextrinsiccurvature ] ) , we have @xmath63 from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma])-([surfacepressure ] ) , we deduce the surface stress - energy components given by @xmath64 respectively",
    ". obviously @xmath59 and @xmath65 obey the conservation equation @xmath66    in order to be able to solve the two nontrivial equations ( [ dynsurfaceenergy])-([dynsurfacepressure ] ) for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , one needs to specify an equation of state .",
    "here we impose a cold equation of state @xmath69 which follows if the temperature is zero , @xmath70 , in a general equation of state of the form @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the baryonic mass density . in our study",
    "we will make the analysis initially with a generic cold equation of state of the form ( [ generalstateequation ] ) , i.e. , without invoking any specific equation of state , see @xcite , and then particularizing to a specific cold equation of state , see @xcite .      besides doing the analysis for a general equation of state of the form @xmath74 , as in eq .",
    "( [ generalstateequation ] ) , we want to study specific cases by giving an equation of state .",
    "we resort in the following to a particularly interesting equation of state , namely , an equation of state analogous to the dark energy equation of state considered in cosmology , i.e. , @xmath75 such a dark energy fluid can be divided into three cases : a normal dark energy fluid when @xmath76 , a cosmological constant fluid when @xmath77 , and a phantom energy fluid when @xmath78 .",
    "all of these fluids are possible candidates responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "but in addition to its cosmological interest , the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) can also be used for domain walls and wormholes , connecting opposite spacetime regions .",
    "the case of a static wormhole is particularly simple , yet it provides interestingly enough results . equations ( [ dynsurfaceenergy])-([dynsurfacepressure ] ) reduce to @xmath79 since there is a generic equation of state of the type given in eq .",
    "( [ generalstateequation ] ) , the constants @xmath29 , @xmath32 , and @xmath6 are inter - related .",
    "the surface energy density in ( [ membranesigma ] ) is negative , implying the violation of the weak and dominant energy conditions .",
    "the surface pressure is always positive .",
    "the null energy condition is verified if @xmath80 is satisfied .",
    "thus , taking into account the relationship @xmath81 we see that the null energy condition is verified only for @xmath82 , and violated for @xmath83 .",
    "the strong energy condition is satisfied if @xmath80 and @xmath84 , and by continuity implies the null energy condition . using the condition",
    "@xmath85 we verify that the strong energy condition is readily satisfied for @xmath82 .",
    "it is also of interest to analyze the attractive or repulsive character @xcite of this plane symmetric traversable wormhole .",
    "the four - velocity of a static observer is @xmath86 .",
    "the observer s four - acceleration is @xmath87 , so that taking into account eq .",
    "( [ planarbh ] ) , the only non - zero component is given by @xmath88 from the geodesic equation , a radially moving test particle which starts from rest initially has the equation of motion @xmath89 therefore , @xmath90 is the radial component of proper acceleration that an observer must maintain in order to remain at rest at constant @xmath91 .",
    "it is interesting to note that a wormhole is `` attractive '' if @xmath92 , i.e. , observers must maintain an outward - directed radial acceleration to keep from being pulled into the wormhole ; and `` repulsive '' if @xmath93 , i.e. , observers must maintain an inward - directed radial acceleration to avoid being pushed away from the wormhole .",
    "note that for @xmath82 , the wormhole is attractive . for @xmath83 ,",
    "the wormhole is repulsive for the values @xmath94{|m|/2}/\\alpha$ ] , and attractive for @xmath95{|m|/2}/\\alpha$ ] .",
    "in particular , for @xmath96{|m|/2}/\\alpha$ ] static observers are geodesic .      to justify the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) let us first try a well known case , the surface stress - energy tensor without trace .",
    "as we will show now , this is no good .",
    "the traceless surface stress - energy tensor , @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 , could be a case of particular interest , since the casimir effect with a massless field gives a stress - energy tensor of this type .",
    "this effect is theoretically invoked to provide exotic matter to the system considered at hand . from @xmath98 we deduce @xmath99 , which is inside the event horizon of the planar black hole , or the black membrane , and so is no good . as in the spherical symmetric case @xcite",
    ", there is no solution of the einstein field equations because @xmath59 and @xmath60 are imaginary , as one may readily verify from eqs .",
    "( [ membranesigma])-([membranepressure ] ) .",
    "so , one has to resort to the equation of state given in ( [ eos ] ) , i.e. , @xmath100 , with @xmath101 . that @xmath102 has to be less than zero can be seen directly from equations ( [ membranesigma])-([membranepressure ] ) .",
    "indeed , as the surface energy density is always negative , @xmath103 , and the tangential surface pressure is always positive , @xmath104 , then the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) imposes the condition @xmath101 , i.e. , a dark energy equation of state . as mentioned above",

    "indeed , for the latter , the particular case of @xmath77 reduces to @xmath105 , which corresponds to the classical membrane , this being described by the three - dimensional generalization of the nambu - goto action , and being the simplest domain wall one may construct @xcite . from eq .",

    "one should impose the additional no horizon condition , @xmath112 , since if the condition is not satisfied there are no static solutions , and moreover the wormholes would be inside their own gravitational radius , a situation which is of no interest here .",
