    "<S> in this talk , multiquarks are studied microscopically in a standard quark model . in pure ground - state pentaquarks </S>",
    "<S> the short - range interaction is computed and it is shown to be repulsive . an additional quark - antiquark pair is then considered , and this is suggested to produce linear molecular system , with a narrow decay width . </S>",
    "<S> the quarks assemble in three hadronic clusters , and the central hadron provides stability . </S>",
    "<S> the possible crypto - heptaquark hadrons with exotic pentaquark flavours , with strange , charmed and bottomed quarks , are predicted .    </S>",
    "<S> exotic multiquarks are expected since the early works of jaffe @xcite , and the masses and decays in the su(3 ) exotic anti - decuplet were first predicted within the chiral soliton model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pentaquarks have been revived recently by several searches of the @xmath0(1540 ) @xcite , first discovered at leps @xcite , and by searches of the @xmath1(1860 ) @xcite and of the @xmath2(3100 ) @xcite , observed respectively at na49 @xcite and at h1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pentaquark structures have also been studied on the lattice @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . moreover multiquarks are favoured by the presence of several different flavours @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the @xmath2(3100 ) at h1 , the observation of double - charmed baryons at selex @xcite , and the future search of double - charmed baryons at compass @xcite suggest that new pentaquarks with one or two heavy quarks remain to be discovered .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that a narrow pentaquark must contain an excitation , to prevent a decay width of hundreds of mev to a meson - baryon channel . here </S>",
    "<S> i consider that a s - wave flavour - singlet light quark - antiquark pair @xmath3 is added to the pentaquark @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting heptaquark @xmath5 is a state with parity opposite to the original @xmath4 @xcite , due to the intrinsic parity of fermions and anti - fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the ground - state of @xmath5 is also naturally rearranged in a s - wave baryon and in two s - wave mesons , where the two outer hadrons are repelled , while the central hadron provides stability . because the s - wave pion is the lightest hadron , the minimum energy needed to create a quark - antiquark pair can be as small as 100 - 200 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this energy shift is lower than the typical energy of 300 - 600 mev of spin - isospin or angular excitations in hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the heptaquarks @xmath5 low - energy p - wave decay ( after the extra quark - antiquark pair is annihilated ) , results in a very narrow decay width , consistent with the observed exotic flavour pentaquarks .    </S>",
    "<S> recently this principle was used to suggest that the @xmath0(1540 ) is a @xmath6 molecule with binding energy of 30 mev @xcite , and the @xmath1(1862 ) is a @xmath7 molecule with a binding energy of 60 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i also suggest that the new positive parity scalar @xmath8 and axial @xmath9 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 multiquarks @xcite , and that the @xmath12(3100 ) is consistent with a @xmath13 linear molecule with an energy of 15 mev above threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> i now predict new exotic strange , charmed and bottomed pentaquarks compatible with the linear molecular heptaquark model .    in this talk , multiquarks are studied microscopically in a standard quark - model ( qm ) hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the multiquark state , and the short range interaction of the mesonic or baryonic subclusters of the multiquark are both computed with the multiquark matrix element of the qm hamiltonian , @xmath14 each quark or antiquark has a kinetic energy @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the colour - dependent two - body interaction @xmath16 includes the standard qm confining and hyperfine terms , @xmath17 \\ . \\label{potential}\\ ] ] the potential of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ potential ] ) reproduces the meson and baryon spectrum with quark and antiquark bound states ( from heavy quarkonium to the light pion mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the resonating group method ( rgm ) @xcite was applied by ribeiro @xcite to show that in exotic @xmath18 scattering the quark two - body - potential , together with the pauli repulsion of quarks , explains the @xmath18 hard core repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> recently , addressing a tetraquark system with @xmath19 quantum numbers , it was shown that the qm with the quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath20 also fully complies with chiral symmetry , including the adler zero and the weinberg theorem @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for the purpose of this talk , only the matrix elements of the potentials in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hamiltonian ] ) matter . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron spectrum constrains the hyperfine potential @xmath21 from the pion mass @xcite , the matrix elements of the annihilation potential are , @xmath22 which is correct for the annihilation of @xmath23 or @xmath24 quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation potential only shows up in non - exotic channels , and it is clear from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sum rules ] ) that the annihilation potential provides an attractive ( negative ) interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the quark - quark(antiquark ) potential is dominated by the interplay of the hyperfine interaction of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hyperfine ] ) and the pauli quark exchange . in s - wave systems with low spin </S>",
    "<S> this results in a repulsive interaction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , i arrive at the attraction / repulsion criterion for groundstate hadrons : + - _ whenever the two interacting hadrons have quarks ( or antiquarks ) with a common flavour , the repulsion is increased by the pauli principle ; + - when the two interacting hadrons have a quark and an antiquark with the same flavour , the attraction is enhanced by the quark - antiquark annihilation_. + for instance , @xmath25 is attractive , and @xmath26 is repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> this qualitative rule is confirmed by quantitative computations of the short - range interactions of the @xmath27 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> again , the attraction / repulsion criterion shows that the exotic pentaquarks containing five quarks only are repelled . to increase binding we include a light @xmath3 quark - antiquark pair in the system . </S>",
    "<S> i now detail the strategy to find the possible linear heptaquark molecules . </S>",
    "<S> + * a ) * the top quark is excluded because it is too unstable . to minimise the short - range repulsion and to increase the attraction of the three - hadron system , </S>",
    "<S> i only consider pentaquarks with a minimally exotic isospin , and with low spin . + </S>",
    "<S> * b ) * here the flavour is decomposed in an s - wave system of a spin @xmath28 baryon and two pseudoscalar mesons , except for the vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are also considered . + * c ) * i consider as candidates for narrow pentaquarks systems where one hadron is attracted by both other ones . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion is used to discriminate which hadrons are bound and which are repelled . + * d ) * in the case of some exotic flavour pentaquarks , only a four - hadron - molecule or a five - hadron - molecule would bind . </S>",
    "<S> these cases are not detailed , because they are difficult to create in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> + * e ) * moreover , in the particular case where one of the three hadrons is a @xmath31 , binding is only assumed if the @xmath31 is the central hadron , attracted both by the other two ones . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31 is too light to be bound by just one hadron @xcite . + </S>",
    "<S> * f ) * the masses of the bound states with a pion are computed assuming a total binding energy of the order of 10 mev , averaging the binding energy of the @xmath0 and of the @xmath2 system in the molecular perspective . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the other bound states are computed assuming a total binding energy of the order of 50 mev , averaging the binding energies of the @xmath1 and of the new positive - parity @xmath32 mesons . + * g ) * here higher excitations are neglected ( they would further increase the binding energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an error bar of @xmath33 30 mev for the mass . </S>",
    "<S> when one of the hadrons in the molecule is not listed by the particle data group @xcite , its mass is extracted from a recent lattice computation @xcite , and the error bar is @xmath33 100 mev . + * e ) * although three - body decay channels are possible through quark rearrangement , their observation requires high experimental statistics . </S>",
    "<S> only some of the different possible two - body decay processes are detailed here .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , this work has performed a systematic search of exotic - flavour pentaquarks , using the heptaquark , or linear three - body hadronic - molecule perspective . </S>",
    "<S> this perspective is the result of standard qm computations of pentaquarks and hepatquark masses and of hadron - hadron short - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of new exotic flavour - pentaquarks are predicted in tables 1 , 2 and 3 together with their two - body decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> the systems with more than one heavy antiquark are very numerous and they are omitted here . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to remark that degenerate states are shared by tables 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , some new multiquarks may be easier to bind than the presently observed exotic pentaquarks . </S>"
