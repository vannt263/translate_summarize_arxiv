    "recently the development of new heavy ion facilities ( radioactive beams ) has driven the interest on the dynamical behaviour of asymmetric matter , @xcite . here",
    "we focus our attention on relativistic heavy ion collisions , that provide a unique terrestrial opportunity to probe the in - medium nuclear interaction in high density and high momentum regions .",
    "an effective lagrangian approach to the hadron interacting system is extended to the isospin degree of freedom : within the same frame equilibrium properties ( @xmath3 , @xcite ) and transport dynamics can be consistently derived .    within a covariant picture of the nuclear mean field , for the description of the symmetry energy at saturation ( @xmath4 parameter of the weizsecker mass formula ) ( a ) only the lorentz vector @xmath5 mesonic field , and ( b ) both , the vector @xmath5 ( repulsive ) and scalar @xmath6 ( attractive ) effective fields @xcite can be included . in the latter case",
    "the competition between scalar and vector fields leads to a stiffer symmetry term at high density @xcite .",
    "we present here observable effects in the dynamics of heavy ion collisions .",
    "we focus our attention on the isospin content of meson production .",
    "we finally show that in the compression stage of isospin asymmetric collisions we can even enter a mixed deconfined phase . -1.0 cm",
    "the starting point is a simple phenomenological version of the non - linear ( with respect to the iso - scalar , lorentz scalar @xmath7 field ) effective nucleon - boson field theory , the quantum - hadro - dynamics @xcite .",
    "according to this picture the presence of the hadronic medium leads to effective masses and momenta @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 scalar and vector self - energies . for asymmetric matter",
    "the self - energies are different for protons and neutrons , depending on the isovector meson contributions .",
    "we will call the corresponding models as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and just @xmath13 the case without isovector interactions . for the more general @xmath12 case",
    "the self - energies of protons and neutrons read : @xmath14 ( upper signs for neutrons ) , where @xmath15 are the total and isospin scalar densities and currents and @xmath16 are the coupling constants of the various mesonic fields .",
    "@xmath17 is the solution of the non linear equation for the @xmath7 field @xcite .    for the description of heavy ion collisions we solve the covariant transport equation of the boltzmann type within the relativistic landau vlasov ( @xmath18 ) method , using phase - space gaussian test particles @xcite , and applying a monte - carlo procedure for the hard hadron collisions .",
    "the collision term includes elastic and inelastic processes involving the production / absorption of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 resonances as well as their decays into pion channels , @xcite .",
    "kaon production has been proven to be a reliable observable for the high density @xmath3 in the isoscalar sector @xcite here we show that the @xmath21 production ( in particular the @xmath2 yield ratio ) can be also used to probe the isovector part of the @xmath3 , @xcite .    using our @xmath22 transport approach we analyze pion and kaon production in central @xmath23 collisions in the @xmath24 beam energy range , comparing models giving the same `` soft '' @xmath3 for symmetric matter and with different effective field choices for @xmath25 .",
    "we will use three lagrangians with constant nucleon - meson couplings ( @xmath26 type , see before ) and one with density dependent couplings ( @xmath27 , see @xcite ) , recently suggested for better nucleonic properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "[ kaon1 ] reports the temporal evolution of @xmath28 resonances , pions ( @xmath29 ) and kaons ( @xmath30 ) for central au+au collisions at @xmath31 .     -0.3 cm    -0.7 cm [ kaon1 ]    it is clear that , while the pion yield freezes out at times of the order of @xmath32 , i.e. at the final stage of the reaction ( and at low densities ) , kaon production occur within the very early ( compression ) stage , and the yield saturates at around @xmath33 . from fig . [ kaon1 ]",
    "we see that the pion results are weakly dependent on the isospin part of the nuclear mean field .",
    "however , a slight increase ( decrease ) in the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) multiplicity is observed when going from the @xmath13 ( or @xmath27 ) to the @xmath11 and then to the @xmath12 model , i.e. increasing the vector contribution @xmath36 in the isovector channel .",
    "this trend is more pronounced for kaons , see the right panel , due to the high density selection of the source and the proximity to the production threshold .",
    "consistently , as shown in the insert , larger effects are expected for early emitted kaons , reflecting the early @xmath37 of the system .",
    "when isovector fields are included the symmetry potential energy in neutron - rich matter is repulsive for neutrons and attractive for protons . in a @xmath38",
    "this leads to a fast , pre - equilibrium , emission of neutrons .",
    "such a @xmath39 mechanism , often referred to as isospin fractionation @xcite , is responsible for a reduction of the neutron to proton ratio during the high density phase , with direct consequences on particle production in inelastic @xmath40 collisions .",
    "@xmath41 effects represent a more subtle point .",
    "the energy conservation in a hadron collision in general has to be formulated in terms of the canonical momenta , i.e. for a reaction @xmath42 as @xmath43 since hadrons are propagating with effective ( kinetic ) momenta and masses , an equivalent relation should be formulated starting from the effective in - medium quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the scalar and vector self - energies , eqs.([selfen ] ) .",
    "the self - energy contributions will influence the particle production at the level of thresholds as well as of the phase space available in the final channel .",
    "in fact the _ threshold _ effect is dominant and consequently the results are nicely sensitive to the covariant structure of the isovector fields . at each beam energy",
    "we see an increase of the @xmath1 and @xmath48 yield ratios with the models @xmath49 . the effect is larger for the @xmath48 compared to the @xmath1 ratio .",
    "this is due to the subthreshold production and to the fact that the isospin effect enters twice in the two - step production of kaons , see @xcite .",
    "interestingly the iso-@xmath3 effect for pions is increasing at lower energies , when approaching the production threshold .",
    "we have to note that in a previous study of kaon production in excited nuclear matter the dependence of the @xmath48 yield ratio on the effective isovector interaction appears much larger ( see fig.8 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the point is that in the non - equilibrium case of a heavy ion collision the asymmetry of the source where kaons are produced is in fact reduced by the @xmath50 `` transformation '' , due to the favored @xmath51 processes .",
    "this effect is almost absent at equilibrium due to the inverse transitions , see fig.3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover in infinite nuclear matter even the fast neutron emission is not present .",
    "this result clearly shows that chemical equilibrium models can lead to uncorrect results when used for transient states of an @xmath52 system .",
    "the hadronic matter is expected to undergo a phase transition to a deconfined phase of quarks and gluons at large densities and/or high temperatures .",
    "on very general grounds , the transition s critical densities are expected to depend on the isospin of the system , but no experimental tests of this dependence have been performed so far .     -0.5",
    "cm    -0.7 cm    in order to check the possibility of observing some precursor signals of a new physics even in collisions of stable nuclei at intermediate energies we have performed some event simulations for the collision of very heavy , neutron - rich , elements .",
    "we have chosen the reaction @xmath53 ( average proton fraction @xmath54 ) at @xmath55 and semicentral impact parameter @xmath56 just to increase the neutron excess in the interacting region . in fig .",
    "[ figuu ] we report the evolution of momentum distribution and baryon density in a space cell located in the c.m . of the system .",
    "we see that after about @xmath57 a local equilibration is achieved .",
    "we have a unique fermi distribution and from a simple fit we can evaluate the local temperature ( black numbers in mev ) .",
    "we note that a rather exotic nuclear matter is formed in a transient time of the order of @xmath57 , with baryon density around @xmath58 , temperature @xmath59 , energy density @xmath60 and proton fraction between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , likely inside the estimated mixed phase region .",
    "in fact we can study the isospin dependence of the transition densities @xcite .",
    "the structure of the mixed phase is obtained by imposing the gibbs conditions @xcite for chemical potentials and pressure and by requiring the conservation of the total baryon and isospin densities @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the fraction of quark matter in the mixed phase .    -0.3 cm    -1.0",
    "cm [ rhodelta ]    in this way we get the @xmath65 surface which gives the phase coexistence region in the @xmath66 space . for a fixed value of the conserved charge @xmath67 we will study the boundaries of the mixed phase region in the @xmath68 plane . in the hadronic phase the charge chemical potential is given by @xmath69 thus , we expect critical densities rather sensitive to the isovector channel in the hadronic @xmath3 .    in fig .",
    "[ rhodelta ] we show the crossing density @xmath70 separating nuclear matter from the quark - nucleon mixed phase , as a function of the proton fraction @xmath71 .",
    "we can see the effect of the @xmath6-coupling towards an @xmath72 crossing due to the larger symmetry repulsion at high baryon densities .",
    "in the same figure we report the paths in the @xmath73 plane followed in the c.m .",
    "region during the collision of the n - rich @xmath74sn+@xmath74sn system , at different energies . at @xmath75",
    "we are just reaching the border of the mixed phase , and we are well inside it at @xmath55 .",
    "we expect a _ neutron trapping _ effect , supported by statistical fluctuations as well as by a symmetry energy difference in the two phases . in fact while in the hadron phase we have a large neutron potential repulsion ( in particular in the @xmath12 case ) , in the quark phase we only have the much smaller kinetic contribution .",
    "observables related to such neutron `` trapping '' could be an inversion in the trend of the formation of neutron rich fragments and/or of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 yield ratios for reaction products coming from high density regions , i.e. with large transverse momenta .",
    "we have shown that meson production in n - rich heavy ions collisions at intermediate energies can bring new information on the isovector part of the in - medium interaction at high baryon densities .",
    "important non - equilibrium effects for particle production are stressed .",
    "finally the possibility of observing precursor signals of the phase transition to a mixed hadron - quark matter at high baryon density is suggested .",
