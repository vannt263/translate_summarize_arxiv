    "polarization information from the decays of weak gauge bosons provide an important clue to their production mechanism . in particular ,",
    "if a weak boson pair is produced from the decay of a heavy higgs boson , the bosons are largely longitudinally polarized . on the other hand ,",
    "continuum production of weak bosons yields primarily transversely polarized bosons .",
    "extracting the polarization signal from weak boson decays will be important to characterize a higgs boson signal .",
    "alternative models with a strongly interacting electroweak symmetry breaking sector also have enhanced longitudinal boson pair production rates.@xcite the polarization of the weak bosons may be one way to differentiate between signal and background .",
    "polarization effects in higgs boson decay into the ` gold - plated mode ' @xmath5 have been investigated in detail in the literature.@xcite at the proposed large hadron collider ( lhc ) with proton - proton collisions at @xmath6 tev and an annual integrated luminosity of @xmath3 pb@xmath4 , polarization information for high mass higgs bosons will be difficult to extract with the limited statistics . to aid in a higgs boson search at the lhc , and as a complementary analysis , we have proposed using the process @xmath7.@xcite this decay mode has a factor of six enhancement over the gold - plated mode when @xmath8.@xcite our analysis involves the average value of a quantity obtained from the charged lepton angular decay distribution , which differs for leptons coming from longitudinally polarized @xmath0 s , ( @xmath9 ) and transversely polarized @xmath0 s ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the precise quantity is described in section ii .    by considering the average value rather than the decay distribution itself ,",
    "there are two advantages .",
    "first , the statistics in an experiment at the lhc will be inadequate to examine angular decay distributions as a function of transverse mass or missing transverse momentum of the event for heavy higgs boson decays .",
    "the average of the lepton angular decay distribution nevertheless distinguishes between background and signal plus background .",
    "second , the average value of this quantity is fairly insensitive to theoretical uncertainties in the differential cross sections related to scale choices and higher order corrections .",
    "our goal in this paper is to establish the feasibility of this polarization measurement at the lhc using the process @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , we consider only the dominant contributions to the event rate with a charged lepton pair and large missing transverse momentum .",
    "we examine the polarization signal in heavy higgs production and decay to charged leptons pairs and missing energy for 10@xmath12 pb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity .",
    "our results suggest that with sufficient enhancement of longitudinal boson scattering in some non - resonant strongly interacting vector boson models , the polarization signals may be observable at high energies .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the heavy higgs boson signal of interest , @xmath7 , and the polarization variable . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the various higgs boson production mechanisms and background processes . in section iv , we show that with the dominant contributions to the signal , irreducible and reducible backgrounds , a higgs boson signal in the mass range considered here , from 400 - 800 gev , can be extracted except at the highest higgs masses .",
    "a factor of four increase in integrated luminosity makes polarization signals at @xmath13 gev feasible .",
    "we also show the effects of experimental cuts and uncertainties associated with theory and statistics . in section v ,",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we begin with a discussion of @xmath14 .",
    "the higgs boson mass range considered here is 400 - 800 gev .",
    "this range was chosen because for masses lower than @xmath15 gev , the qcd background rates for @xmath16missing jet are very high . in the mass range below 400 gev , the gold - plated mode has an event rate large enough for unambiguous higgs identification .",
    "the upper bound was chosen based on unitarity estimates of the maximum allowed higgs mass , first done by lee , quigg and thacker.@xcite over this range of higgs masses , the branching fraction into @xmath0 pairs is approximately @xmath17 , with the remaining width primarily due to @xmath18 pair production .",
    "essential to our analysis is the fact that the higgs boson decays preferentially into longitudinally polarized weak bosons .",
    "a straightforward calculation of the ratio of the polarized widths gives @xmath19 for masses @xmath20 gev .",
    "already at @xmath21 gev , the ratio is 100 .",
    "the angular decay distribution of the charged leptons from the @xmath0 decay characterize the polarization of the @xmath0 . defining the angle @xmath22 by the @xmath0 momentum axis and the charged lepton three momentum in the @xmath0 rest frame , the angular decay distributions , with @xmath23 , are @xmath24 for longitudinally and transversely polarized @xmath0 s respectively . with these distributions",
    ", one sees that @xmath25 for purely longitudinal @xmath0 s and @xmath26 for purely transverse @xmath0 s .",
    "this is the effect that we exploit .",
    "the large enhancement factor in the ratio of longitudinal to transverse polarized @xmath0 s is very promising , but unfortunately , the longitudinal polarization four - vector is not boost invariant in general . the ratio in eq . (",
    "2.1 ) is valid for higgs decay only in its rest frame",
    ". the ratio decreases as one boosts the higgs to larger momenta . for gold - plated modes",
    ", one can boost back to the higgs rest frame and use the @xmath0 momenta in that frame to define the polarization axes .",
    "this has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . with one @xmath0 decaying to neutrinos ,",
    "it is not possible to unambiguously determine the higgs rest frame .",
    "the heavy higgs masses considered here are large enough that the typical boosts from the higgs rest frame to the collider frame are small , so one still sees a significant enhancement in the production of @xmath0 s with longitudinal polarization in the hadron center of mass ( collider ) frame .",
    "we use the momentum axis of the reconstructed @xmath0 in the collider frame to define the angle @xmath22 for the @xmath27 angular distribution .    in our numerical results presented below",
    ", we evaluate the average value of @xmath28 . by constructing the longitudinal polarization four - vector @xmath29 in the collider frame from the reconstructed @xmath0 momentum @xmath30 ,",
    "namely , @xmath31 one finds for @xmath32 , the charged lepton momentum in the collider frame , that @xmath33 we evaluate the average value of @xmath34 as a function of transverse mass @xmath35 where @xmath36 ^ 2- ( \\vec{p}_t + \\vec{p\\llap/}_t)^2\\ ] ] here , @xmath37 refers to the momentum carried by the neutrino pair transverse to the beam axis . for muons ,",
    "the experimental evaluation of @xmath38 should be very precise .",
    "the experimental errors associated with missing transverse momentum enter into the determination of the transverse mass , not the evaluation of @xmath34 .",
    "operationally , our procedure here is to evaluate the dominant contributions to the total cross section for @xmath39 and to determine their average @xmath34 values as a function of transverse mass , then take the cross section weighted average : @xmath40 we make the following cuts on the transverse momentum and rapidity of the charged leptons , as well as a cut requiring that the charged lepton pair reconstruct to a @xmath0 : @xmath41 we consider two choices for @xmath42 : @xmath43 and @xmath44 . increasing the transverse momentum cut for the charged leptons",
    "has the effect of reducing the separation between the purely longitudinal and purely transverse values for @xmath45 . as a practical matter",
    ", the invariant mass cut has no effect on our calculations presented below because the dominant background contributions include @xmath46 in the final state . in our calculations",
    ", we use the narrow width approximation for the @xmath0 decay to leptons .",
    "the invariant mass cut does reduce backgrounds from , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .    in the next section",
    "we describe the various contributions to the total signal plus background cross section . in our numerical results , we include only @xmath49 , however , we do not factor in efficiencies in our evaluation of event rates .",
    "we use the leading order cteq3 parton distribution functions and five - flavor @xmath50 mev in our evaluation of the cross sections.@xcite in terms of the incoming parton momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the factorization and renormalization scales are set to @xmath53 .",
    "the dominant higgs signal production mechanism for @xmath54 depends on the top quark mass .",
    "the reports of the discovery of the top quark with a mass of @xmath55 gev@xcite mean that the largest contribution to @xmath56 at lhc energies for @xmath20 gev comes from gluon fusion @xmath57 , where the gluons couple to the higgs through a triangle diagram with a top quark internal loop . in principle , one should include non - resonant @xmath58 contributions , however , at @xmath6 tev , these contributions are small.@xcite contributions to higgs production with top quarks in the initial or final state are suppressed so as to give no appreciable contribution to the cross section.@xcite in what follows , we set @xmath59 gev .",
    "a second important production mechanism for @xmath0-pairs is through vector boson fusion .",
    "initially , calculations were done using the effective @xmath18 approximation , giving @xmath60 and @xmath61 , using the @xmath18 and @xmath0 distributions in the proton.@xcite more recently , full calculations of @xmath62 and related processes are done instead.@xcite using the higgs resonance portion of @xmath63 and related processes with quarks and antiquarks in the initial state , we find that the cross section from vector boson fusion is 1/10 to 1/3 of the gluon fusion cross section for the mass range from 400 - 800 gev . in line with our aim to evaluate the feasibility of the polarization measurement",
    ", we only include the dominant gluon fusion part of the higgs cross section and comment below on the effect of changing the normalization of the signal part of the contribution to @xmath64 .",
    "the production of @xmath0 pairs from quark fusion is the dominant contribution to the irreducible background to the @xmath14 signal in the higgs resonance region .",
    "we include here the leading order contribution : @xmath65 , as in ref .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal @xmath0 boson contributions to the total @xmath65 differential cross section , as a function of the @xmath0-pair invariant mass , are shown in fig . 1",
    ". also indicated is the @xmath57 result for @xmath66 gev .",
    "longitudinal @xmath0-pair production is indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "as advertised , the @xmath67 contribution significantly dominates the irreducible background .",
    "the next to leading order to @xmath65 , with crossed diagrams , gives an enhancement of a factor of @xmath68 in the cross section.@xcite our monte carlo calculation of @xmath69 relies on the leading order matrix element for the irreducible background , but we discuss below the consequences of increasing the normalization of this background .    the qcd process with production of a single @xmath0 plus missing jet is the largest reducible background . at leading order in @xmath70 , this comes from @xmath71 and crossed diagrams .",
    "a fraction of the events will have the final state parton which is missed in the detector , so it contributes to events with @xmath72 .",
    "we model this background by imposing the selection cuts outlined in sec .",
    "ii , together with a requirement that the rapidity of the parton @xmath73 satisfy @xmath74 the idea here is that for high rapidity partons , the parton `` jet '' is outside of the detector coverage , and thus is `` missing . ''",
    "we consider two values of @xmath75 : @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the combination of @xmath77 with @xmath78 is particularly difficult to satisfy for this background process .",
    "the rate for single @xmath0 production at large @xmath79 is very high compared to the rate for @xmath0-pairs at the same transverse momentum , so the rapidity cuts are essential .",
    "the @xmath16missing jet background is the largest reducible background .",
    "other processes , not included in this analysis , have some of the ingredients of the @xmath80 signal , but typically have additional activity in the event . for example , the cross section for @xmath81 is large . when the @xmath82 decays outside of the central region ,",
    "it is included in the @xmath16 missing jet background .",
    "when it decays in the central region , at high transverse momentum of @xmath83 , the electron and quark jet will largely align with the missing momentum .",
    "cuts that veto these events are required .",
    "the requirement of no central jets , together with the invariant mass cut in eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) , also eliminates the background from @xmath84 .    to illustrate the dominant signal , irreducible and reducible backgrounds , we show @xmath85 in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "the solid lines show the gluon fusion contribution to higgs production .",
    "the dashed line shows @xmath65 , and the dotted line indicates the qcd @xmath0+missing jet contribution .",
    "the fully correlated decays of one @xmath0 to one family of charged leptons , and the other @xmath0 to neutrino pairs , is included in the @xmath86 cross sections .",
    "the cuts applied are those in eqs .",
    "( 2.8 - 2.10,3.1 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , we have set @xmath87 .",
    "the reducible background is quite large for @xmath88 gev , making these cuts less than ideal except for very high mass higgs bosons .",
    "a better choice is shown in the next figure .",
    "3 shows the same quantities with @xmath89 and @xmath78 .",
    "the transverse mass peaks stand out well for @xmath90 gev and 600 gev in fig .",
    "the event rates are such that the discovery mode will be the four - charged - lepton final states .",
    "using the cuts in fig . 3 for the @xmath91 final states , we find 770 signal events for @xmath90 gev in the range of @xmath92 gev and 240 background events in the same range , assuming an integrated luminosity of 10@xmath93 pb@xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath66 gev , the same cuts yield 160 events for the higgs signal and 77 events for the background for @xmath94 gev .",
    "an 800 gev higgs boson yields 24 signal events and 19 background events in a range of @xmath95 gev . using the cuts in fig .",
    "2 , the signal event rates are slightly higher , but the background event rates are significantly higher except for the highest mass range . for @xmath95 gev and @xmath13 gev ,",
    "the signal remains at 24 events and the background is 25 events for the fig .",
    "we present our results in a series of figures where we show the value of @xmath45 as a function of transverse mass . here , @xmath45 is evaluated via eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) . combining the reducible and irreducible backgrounds , we write",
    "( 2.7 ) as @xmath96 for the signal ( s ) and background ( b ) differential cross sections indicated in figs . 2 and 3 with @xmath97 .",
    "the values of @xmath45 are subject to uncertainties which include the relative normalization of the signal to background , as well as measurement uncertainties . a k - factor @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) is included to estimate the error associated with qcd corrections by changing the relative normalization of the signal to background cross sections .",
    "a value of @xmath99 is a rough estimate of the theoretical uncertainty in the background calculation .",
    "we begin with @xmath100 , and plot @xmath45 versus @xmath35 for 400 , 600 and 800 gev higgs bosons in figs .",
    "4a , 4b and 4c .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) with @xmath97 is shown by the solid line and @xmath99 is given by the dotted line .",
    "the values of @xmath101 are indicated by the dot - dashed line , and @xmath102 are indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the 400 and 600 gev higgs boson transverse mass peaks in fig .",
    "2 translate to dips in the value of @xmath45 as the cross section moves from background dominated to signal dominated . the broader dip for the case of @xmath13 gev is still evident .",
    "the reducible @xmath16missing jet background nearly obscures the dip for @xmath90 gev when @xmath100 .",
    "we now turn to the rapidity cuts that reduce the @xmath16missing jet background . in figs .",
    "5a , 5b and 5c , we show @xmath103 versus @xmath35 for @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "these plots have error bars with our estimate of the uncertainty in the measurements of @xmath45 due to statistics .",
    "the error bars were estimated by using using events generated by a monte carlo generator with the three dominant signal , reducible and irreducible background contributions .",
    "the monte carlo events passing the cuts are grouped by transverse mass bin .",
    "values of @xmath45 are determined for many collections of @xmath104 events for a particular bin , where @xmath104 is the theoretically predicted number of events in the bin based on an integrated luminosity of @xmath105 pb@xmath4 .",
    "the error bar for the bin is the standard deviation of these values of @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "5c , we have slightly offset the central values of the transverse mass bins to better exhibit the overlapping error bars .    for @xmath106 gev , the polarization signal plus background is distinguishable from the polarization with no higgs boson contribution . for @xmath13 gev ,",
    "the distinction between @xmath45 with and without the higgs boson is difficult to make with an integrated luminosity of @xmath105 pb@xmath107 because of limitations due to the statistical error .",
    "if the event rate can be increased by a factor of four , then this method looks more promising . for @xmath108 gev",
    ", the cross section is large enough to reduce the statistical errors and make a distinction between background and signal plus background values of @xmath45 feasible .",
    "since our event rates are determined using leading order matrix elements and only dominant contributions , the error bars presented here may be conservative .",
    "however , the error bars are indicative of how difficult the full angular distribution measurements will be for heavy higgs masses .",
    "resonant peak searches in the four charged lepton decay modes of heavy higgs decay , @xmath109 , remain the preferred path to higgs boson discovery , except at the highest higgs masses considered here .",
    "before the integrated luminosity achieves @xmath3 pb@xmath4 , measurements of @xmath45 for @xmath106 gev are a reasonable alternative to the full angular distributions described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a scenario with @xmath13 gev at the lhc with @xmath3 pb@xmath4 , event rates are low and the peak is not pronounced .",
    "a measurement of @xmath45 supplements a measurement of an enhanced cross section for @xmath110 , and characterizes the production mechanism of the @xmath0 pair , however an integrated luminosity of more than @xmath3 pb@xmath4 is required for a measurable difference between signal plus background and background alone in the @xmath45 distribution according to our dominant production analysis . for masses smaller than 800 gev ,",
    "this method can characterize the production mechanism for @xmath0-pairs .",
    "our results suggest that this technique may also be applied to study models@xcite with enhanced , non - resonant or broad - resonant , longitudinal vector boson scattering .",
