    "in the standard model of cosmology , dark matter comprises one of the dominant components in the energy budget of the universe , amounting to about @xmath3 according to planck data @xcite .",
    "our knowledge of structure formation requires dark matter to be cold , with the standard interpretation thus considering weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , with particles masses in the range of @xmath4  gev .",
    "if the observed dark matter abundance is to be explained via thermal relics , the latter translates into a constraint on the annihilation cross section of @xmath5  @xmath6  s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "+ the resulting annihilation of dark matter can give rise to a number of astrophysical implications , which can potentially help to discover or constrain the true nature of dark matter . in the galactic center , comparing predictions of annihilation signals with observed fluxes in particular in the gamma - ray regime have led to strong upper limits particularly for dark matter candidates in the mev range , including lower bounds on the dark matter particle mass @xcite , the s - wave annihilation cross section @xcite and the annihilation rate into positrons @xcite .",
    "similar upper bounds have been inferred from the microwave excess observed with wmap @xcite .",
    "+ the galactic center is particularly well - suited for such dark matter probes , as the enhanced dark matter density will naturally boost the annihilation rate .",
    "in fact , while there is evidence for various types of emission coming from that region , it is still a matter of ongoing debate whether the latter could be due to astrophysical effects .",
    "this includes the @xmath8 kev line emission @xcite , as well as the detection of gev photons @xcite , microwave photons @xcite and positrons @xcite . the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams ) on the international space station ( iss ) recently confirmed with unprecedented precision @xcite , previous measurements from the pamela @xcite and fermi @xcite experiments showing a clear rise in the positron fraction above energies of @xmath9  gev @xcite , which have been tested against pulsar and dark matter models @xcite .",
    "+ at early cosmic times , also the mean dark matter density in the universe has been enhanced , leading to potentially observable effects .",
    "this is already relevant during the epoch of recombination , where dark matter annihilation may increase the available energy input and affect both the temperature and polarization power spectra of the cmb @xcite .",
    "specifically , it may cause an increased ionization fraction during recombination thereby causing an enhancement in the polarization signal at large angular scales @xcite .",
    "similarly , dark matter particularly in the mev mass range has been shown to potentially influence the epoch of reionization , where the universe has been reionized by the first sources of light , with possible contributions from self - annihilating dark matter .",
    "the latter has been shown by @xcite , including the derivation of upper limits for the dark matter annihilation cross section @xcite .",
    "+ however , also the more massive wimps have been shown to produce potentially relevant astrophysical effects .",
    "for instance , in environments of high dark matter densities , including the galactic center or the epoch of reionization , dark matter annihilation can act as a power source inside the stars and therefore alter their stellar evolution as well as the lifetimes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the context of such models",
    ", it is conceivable that some of the first stars that formed in the universe are still existing at the present day .",
    "it should however be noted that constraints and upper limits can be derived based on the observed gamma - ray background and the duration of reionization @xcite . +",
    "as recently shown by @xcite , the same may occur during the epoch of helium reionization , where highly energetic photons produced in dark matter annihilation events contribute to the transition from the singly - ionized state to the doubly - ionized state of helium .",
    "as shown in that study , the main contribution to this effect arises around redshifts of @xmath10 , where the clumpiness in the dark matter distribution is strongly increasing , thus considerably enhancing the annihilation signal .",
    "the epoch of helium reionization has been probed through the absorption lines of quasars , including q0302003 @xcite , hs 1700 + 6416 @xcite , he 23474342 @xcite ; and hst observations of pks 1935 - 692 @xcite , sdss j2346 - 0016 @xcite , q1157 + 3143 @xcite and sdss j1711 + 6052 @xcite .",
    "these data suggest helium ionization to occur between redshifts of @xmath11 and @xmath12 . +",
    "while this study concerning the effect on helium reionization considered generic wimp models with the cross section based on dark matter relics , the effective cross section at a given redshift may however be time - dependent , depending on the annihilation mechanism . while annihilation through a p - wave channel with the cross - section scaling as @xmath13 @xcite leads to a suppression in the s - wave contribution , processes like the sommerfeld enhancement , with the cross sections scaling as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , can potentially enhance annihilation effects at late times .",
    "the latter could make the effect of dark matter annihilation more relevant at late cosmological epochs , including the epoch of helium reionization .",
    "we adopt here the sommerfeld enhancement model by @xcite , which gives rise to an increased effective annihilation cross section at late times , while maintaining the same initial cross section , and therefore fulfilling the constraint based on the relic dark matter density . + we present the overall framework of our investigation in section  [ 2 ] , providing a summary of the previous formalism outlined by @xcite .",
    "the specific effects due to dark matter annihilation , including our treatment of clumping and sommerfeld enhancement , are then described in section  [ 3 ] . in this section ,",
    "we also provide a generalized definition of the dark matter clumping factor , which accounts for potential local variations of the sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ 4 ] and discussed in section  [ 5 ] .",
    "in this investigation , we build up on the framework previously developed by @xcite , which will be extended here to include the effect of sommerfeld enhancement . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the main equations with a brief discussion of the main physical processes . our modified treatment of the dark matter",
    "will then be presented in the next section . + as a minimal model for early cosmic times , we consider here the ionization effects caused by collisional ionization of he@xmath16 , energy injection by dark matter annihilation and the recombination to he@xmath16 . in addition at late times , we also consider the effect of energetic photons from high redshift quasars .",
    "as has been shown by @xcite they are the major contributors leading to the complete ionization of helium in the igm .",
    "the rate at which the mean ionized fraction of helium evolves is given by @xmath17 the second term describes the contribution from the annihilation of dark matter and is studied in detail in the next section .",
    "the first term here considers the ionization due to photons from quasars .",

    "a value of @xmath33 is adopted for @xmath34 which has also been considerd by @xcite .",
    "a linear interpolation is then pursued in between .",
    "one can note that the baryonic clumping factor used here is smaller in comparison to those used in studies for hydrogen reionization @xcite .",
    "this is a valid assumption since helium reionization is driven by rare objects like quasars and therefore proceeds on larger spatial scales .",
    "the processes described here are important at different cosmological epochs and have a characteristic influence on the evolution of ionized helium at different times .",
    "since the collisional ionization and recombination coefficients are strongly dependent on the igm temperature , we have used the recfast code @xcite to follow the gas temperature for @xmath35 .",
    "we then further assume that the igm temperature rises to @xmath36 k during hydrogen reionization .",
    "to investigate the effect of dark matter annihilation on helium reionization including sommerfeld enhancement , we adopt here a typical framework which is employed to study the impact of dark matter annihilation on hydrogen reionization @xcite .",
    "this approach going back to @xcite assumes that the dark matter particles annihilate into high - energy photons , which allows to determine the energy fractions going into heating , ionization and excitation .",
    "while @xcite employed the simplified approach by @xcite , we generalized the latter approach to include also the double - ionization of helium @xcite adopting the formalism of @xcite .",
    "+ we note that of course more detailed energy injection mechanisms have been worked out in the past @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite have calculated the energy going into different processes for specific dark matter models , including a 10-gev bino - like neutralino , a heavy dark matter candidate of rest mass 1  tev that pair annihilates into muons , and a 200  gev wino - like neutralino that pair annihilates into w@xmath37w@xmath38 pairs .",
    "we also refer to very recent work by @xcite which updated a lot of the microphysical processes .",
    "+ considering the overall uncertainties regarding the nature of dark matter , we here intend however to not investigate specific models , but we rather focus on a generic dark matter scenario just with and without the sommerfeld enhancement . as described further in section  [ 3b ] , the sommerfeld enhancement is treated here in a generic way , without considering possible resonances , that would diminish the sommerfeld effect and bring the results closer to the standard scenario that was already investigated .",
    "such a specific study can be pursued when there is a strong motivation for one particular dark matter candidate , but is not the focus of the work employed here .",
    "+ in our approach , we thus write the ionization term due to dark matter annihilation @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the thermally averaged cross section for annihilation and is a model dependent parameter .",
    "@xmath42 is the fraction of energy that goes into ionizing he@xmath16 and is defined as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the energy that goes into ionizing the atom while @xmath45 is the energy of the incoming particle .",

    "here we consider three models ( a ) uniform density of dark matter with the cross section being the same as at freeze out , ( b ) clumping in dark matter due to the formation of large scale structures and ( c ) the cross section with a sommerfeld enhancement factor .",
    "since the exact dark matter particle masses are not known , we have chosen a @xmath61 gev and a @xmath62 gev mass candidate for this exploration .",
    "we adopt here the bound obtained from planck on the annihilation cross section _",

    "this non - uniform distribution in density is accounted for by a clumping factor which describes the enhancement in the annihilation rate within the high density regions of dark matter halos .",

    "we observe that the ionized fraction initially falls with redshift which shows the decrease in dark matter number density due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "then , there is a sudden increase at a redshift of @xmath108 due to the increase in ionization temperature as a result of hydrogen ionization .",
    "finally there is an increase in helium ionization due to the photons from quasars from about a redshift of @xmath109 which completely ionizes helium at a redshift of about @xmath110 . on the other hand for clumpy dark matter",
    "we observe that there is an increase in helium ionization due to the clumping of dark matter due to the fact that the annihilation rate increases due to the increase in dark matter inhomogeneity during structure formation .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ gra3 ] we observe that in case of sommerfeld enhancement the increase in the ionized fraction is the same for both dark matter particle masses .",
    "this shows that the enhanced cross section and the energy injected per annihilation for the higher mass compensates for the decrease in the number density .",
    "thus we realize that in case of sommerfeld enhancement the factor @xmath111 remains constant and is independent of the particle mass . +",
    "we also show the effect of dark matter particle masses and sommerfeld enhancement on the clumping factor .",

    "[ cap2 ] , we also observe that the clumping factor depends on the range of the adopted halo masses and the concentration parameters .",

    "it can be clearly seen that the ratio of the annihilation rates within the halo to the rate within the background will be same .",

    "[ gamma1001000 ] .",
    "while the annihilation rate for the @xmath62 gev dark matter candidate is reduced compared to the case of @xmath61 gev candidate , the evolution of the ionized fraction of helium is the same in both cases , as the energy released per annihilation by a @xmath62 gev candidate is greater compared to a @xmath61 gev candidate , thus compensating for the lower annihilation rate . in fig .",
    "[ gammase100 ] we show the annihilation rate within the halos for various mass ranges for the @xmath61  gev dark matter particles . for comparison",

    "[ cap3 ] for the three scenarios adopting dark matter particle masses of @xmath61 gev and @xmath62 gev .",
    "it can be clearly seen that for the scenario of clumping without sommerfeld enhancement the ionized fraction is suppressed at all redshifts and the suppression is larger for the @xmath62 gev dark matter candidate . in fig .",
    "[ cap4 ] we have shown the evolution of the ionized fraction with sommerfeld enhancement with various halo mass ranges and we observe that both dark matter particle masses lead to identical results for the various halo mass ranges .",
    "we have investigated the effect of annihilation of clumpy dark matter with sommerfeld enhanced cross sections on the epoch of helium reionization .",
    "here we have used the sommerfeld enhancement model of particle physics @xcite which suggests that the cross section of annihilation gets enhanced by a factor of @xmath114 , considering the upper bounds available from the cmb @xcite .",
    "our results show a clear enhancement of the annihilation signal compared to the case without the sommerfeld effect .",
    "in addition , we find that the resulting abundance of he@xmath0 becomes independent of the mass of the dark matter particles , as the enhanced cross sections for the larger dark matter particle masses compensate for the lower number density of the particles .",
    "the latter thus leads to a qualitative change on how dark matter annihilation affects helium reionization , and we expect that similar results would apply for the epoch of hydrogen reionization as well ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "various annihilation channels can lead to the production of electron positron pairs but as shown by @xcite the @xmath115 channels is the most probable channel .",
    "such uncertainities need to be taken into account for a more careful modeling . +",
    "we also do find that the sommerfeld enhancement saturates quite early , thus leading to the same relative enhancement of the annihilation rate both in the homogeneous background as well as in collapsed halos .",
    "due to this early saturation , the clumping factor of the self - annihilating dark matter turns out to be the same as the case without sommerfeld enhancement . as our previous study @xcite , the contribution of dark matter to helium becomes most relevant between redshifts of @xmath116 , where the contribution from quasars also rises significantly .",
    "also in the presence of a sommerfeld enhancement , it is thus still difficult to disentangle both contributions , requiring a rather precise census of energetic photons produced via agn . alternatively ,",
    "if potential dark matter particles and their interactions are detected at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , one may work out the resulting contributions to the helium reionization . as we find here , these would be independent of the dark matter particle mass , at least in the presence of sommerfeld enhancement .",
    "+ the calculations presented here of course assume that dark matter consists of wimps .",
    "while this is still considered as the main hypothesis to explain the abundance of dark matter , we note that the recent ligo detections of black hole mergers @xcite have stimulated the debate whether primordial black holes may partly contribute to the dark matter density in the universe @xcite .",
    "similarly , the larger diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves @xcite and the ambiguous explanation of small objects like hercules @xcite and segue  1 @xcite remains a challenge within the current paradigm .",
    "we therefore expect that a clear detection of the dark matter particle , for instance via the lhc or as an astrophysical signature via the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will be necessary to uniquely identify the nature of dark matter .",

    "<S> dark matter annihilation can have a strong impact on many astrophysical processes in the universe . in the case of sommerfeld - enhanced annihilation cross sections , </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation rates are enhanced at late times , thus enhancing the potential annihilation signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we here calculate the sommerfeld - enhanced annihilation signatures during the epoch of helium reionization , the epoch where helium becomes fully ionized due to energetic photons . </S>",
    "<S> due to the sommerfeld enhancement , we find that the resulting abundance of he@xmath0 becomes independent of the dark matter particle mass . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting enhancement compared to a standard scenario is thus 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher . for realistic scenarios compatible with cmb constraints , there is no significant shift in the epoch of helium reionization , which is completed between redshifts @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> while it is thus difficult to disentangle dark matter annihilation from astrophysical contributions ( active galactic nuclei ) , a potential detection of dark matter particles and its interactions using the large hadron collider ( lhc ) would allow to quantify the dark matter contribution . </S>"
