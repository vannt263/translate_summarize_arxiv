    "40004000  = 1000            the distortion of the density field in redshift - space by peculiar motion is an old subject ( see e.g. ) .",
    "it is commonly held that on small scales , virialized motion causes the stretching of structures along the line of sight , creating what is often called the fingers - of - god , while on large scales , coherent infall into high density regions causes compression , thereby making structures appear more wall - like in the tangential directions than they are in real - space .",
    "the reader is referred to hamilton @xcite for a comprehensive review .",
    "it has also been recognized for some time , however , that the classic linear prediction by kaiser @xcite overpredicts the compression , even at relatively large scales where the corresponding density field in real - space is quite linear ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "conversely , the dilution effect embodied by the fingers - of - god appears to extend to rather large scales .",
    "( see e.g. . )",
    "we will refer to this phenomenon as translinear redshift distortions .",
    "this effect has often been discussed in the context of attempts to measure @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bias ) using the ratio of the real - space to redshift - space two - point function or the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio of the redshift - space power spectrum ( see e.g. ) .",
    "it is found , both from observations , as well as from n - body simulations , that the linear theory predictions for these ratios fail even at very large scales , where perturbation theory is known to work well in real - space . in general",
    ", one finds that the amount of line - of - sight squashing of the redshift - space two - point function is overpredicted by the linear perturbative formulae .",
    "the large uncertainties in published values of @xmath2 are at least in part due to our poor understanding of this effect ( see table 1 of )",
    ".    a related phenomenon has also been observed in studies of one - point statistics of the density field in redshift - space , albeit in a slightly more subtle form .",
    "hivon et al .",
    "@xcite computed the leading perturbative contribution to @xmath1 and @xmath5 in redshift - space .",
    "they observed that the agreement on large scales between the predicted values and the measured values from n - body simulations is not as good as it is in the case of real - space . only at very small @xmath6 ( the linear fluctuation amplitude in real - space ; in other words , very large smoothing scales ) did they obtain rough agreements .",
    "in fact , above some moderate @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , the value of @xmath8 in redshift - space generally lies below that in real - space , suggesting an effect that resembles the fingers - of - god .",
    "recently , taylor & hamilton @xcite and fisher & nusser @xcite ( see also hatton & cole for detailed comparisons with simulations ) revisited this issue by computing the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio of the redshift - space power spectrum using the zeldovich approximation (; henceforth as za ) .",
    "both pairs of authors were able to obtain accurate predictions for the shape of the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio on translinear scales .",
    "in particular , they demonstrated analytically that the departure from the linear prediction could take place at relatively large scales , and they interpreted the success of the za in accounting for this effect as an indication that the failure of the linear prediction on translinear scales have more to do with coherent infall rather than virialized motion .",
    "it is our aim here to continue this line of investigation of nonlinear effects in redshift distortions , but we will focus our attention on one - point statistics . following earlier work by mcgill @xcite , we explore the role of caustics and multiple - streaming in redshift - space .",
    "it was pointed out by mcgill @xcite , who used one - dimensional zeldovich dynamics , that redshift - space caustics could form even when the real - space density field is only mildly nonlinear .",
    "we will quantify this by computing the average number of streams in both real and redshift - space using the za .",
    "as will be shown , at @xmath9 , the degree of multiple - streaming could be significant in redshift - space but negligible in real - space .",
    "this is covered in  [ nostreams ] .",
    "the above finding indicates that the real to redshift - space mapping enhances the level of nonlinearity .",
    "an interesting feature of multiple - streaming in redshift - space is that , unlike their real - space counterparts , redshift - space multiple streams to a first approximation can flow freely past each other ( at least before real - space caustics actually form ) , because they arise from physically distinct regions in real - space .",
    "this might provide an interesting explanation for why the famous kaiser formulae overpredicts the amount of redshift - space compression along the line of sight , even at moderate @xmath6 s .",
    "redshift - space multiple - streams could then provide a mechanism for counteracting the linear compression .",
    "the free - crossing of redshift - streams in the intermediate regime is not unlike the familiar phenomenon of the thickening of the za pancake . in this sense , the za , which can be viewed as a local approximation where interaction is ignored ( see for a review ;",
    "see also ) , is well - suited for studying this phenomenon .",
    "the formalism for computing the average number of streams was in fact originally developed to calculate the full one - point probability distribution function ( pdf hereafter ) of density .",
    "our work here is a natural extension of earlier work by kofman et al .",
    "@xcite who computed the pdf in real - space using the za",
    ". we will also use the same methodology to compute the pdf as well as the skewness @xmath1 in both real and redshift - space in the small @xmath6 limit .",
    "the formalism is laid out in  [ formalism ] , the computational method is explained in ",
    "[ method ] , and the results of the pdf and @xmath1 calculation are discussed in  [ zpdf ] and [ s3 ] .    we particularly focus our attention on the high density regime of the pdf .",
    "catastrophe theory tells us that caustics generally induce a @xmath10 tail , which , however , is not observed in n - body simulations with cdm - type ( cold - dark - matter ) power spectra , either in real or redshift - space .",
    "in fact , an intriguing property of the pdf in cdm models is that it is well - fit by a single parameter lognormal distribution ( in both real and redshift - space ) , where the caustic - tail is absent ( for real space , see e.g. ) .",
    "we explore the reason for it in  [ smoothing ] , and conclude that smoothing in redshift - space ( or in real - space ) , due to both finite resolution or discreteness and small - scale velocity dispersions , plays an important role in erasing the caustic - feature in the pdf . to understand properly the behavior of the pdf then requires a non - local calculation , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we briefly discuss possible lines of attack in  [ conclude ] .      for the purpose of this article ,",
    "we denote by @xmath11 and @xmath12 the densities in real ( or eulerian ) and redshift space respectively , normalized by the mean density ( i.e. @xmath13 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath11 is determined by the mapping from lagrangian to eulerian space , according to mass conservation :        similarly , the evolution of the redshift - space density is determined by the mapping from eulerian to redshift - space : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the redshift - space coordinate , @xmath21 is the mean redshift of interest , @xmath22 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath21 , @xmath23 is the peculiar velocity and @xmath24 is the unit vector along the line of sight .",
    "the redshift - space density @xmath12 is then given by @xmath25\\right| = \\rho \\ , \\left| { \\rm det}^{-1 } \\left [ { \\partial s^i \\over \\partial x^j }   \\right ] \\right| = \\rho \\left| 1 + { { 1+z}\\over h } { \\partial { \\bf v}\\over \\partial   x^i}\\cdot{\\bf e } e^i \\right|^{-1 } , \\label{rhoz}\\ ] ] where eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) has been used for the second equality .",
    "we have used the remote - observer approximation for the third equality , in other words , setting the term @xmath26 .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming the directional unit vector does not change appreciably for a small displacement in the transverse direction .",
    "in addition , an interesting matrix identity has also been used : @xmath27 = 1 + { \\bf a } \\cdot { \\bf b}$ ] , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are arbitrary vectors .",
    "the za consists of assuming @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the linear time - dependent growth factor",
    ". growing mode ( in other words , irrotational ) initial condition then implies @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the displacement potential and @xmath34 in component form is @xmath35 .",
    "putting the above into eq .",
    "( [ rhoz ] ) , we arrive at the following expression for @xmath12 @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite , can be found in and , but we will adopt @xmath41 , which is a very good approximation at @xmath42 . ] with @xmath43 being the scale factor and @xmath44 being the fraction of critical density in matter .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath44 , @xmath12 is uniquely determined by the line - of - sight unit vector @xmath45 and the displacement matrix @xmath46 .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath12 is then dictated by the probability distributions of the later two quantities .      for gaussian random initial conditions ,",
    "the probability distribution , in lagrangian space , of the displacement matrix @xmath46 can be computed exactly .",
    "one can always go to a frame in which @xmath46 is diagonal , keeping in mind that the line - of - sight is randomly oriented with respect to the eigenvectors of this matrix .",
    "all we need then is the probability distribution of its eigenvalues .",
    "we will denote this probability distribution in lagrangian space by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 s ( @xmath51 ) are the eigenvalues of @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the density in redshift - space can ultimately be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and orientation of the local lagrangian deformation tensor . the statistical properties of @xmath12",
    "can then be inferred from the well - known statistics of the deformation tensor .",
    "( [ rhoz3 ] ) , ( [ rhoz4 ] ) represents a redshift - space generalization of the familiar zeldovich formulae for the density in real - space . just like the zeldovich result in real space , it sheds light on the main features of the local structures in redshift space",
    "the first three factors in eq .",
    "( [ rhoz3 ] ) obviously arise from the mapping from the lagrangian to eulerian ( or real ) space and the last factor comes from that from real to redshift - space .",
    "the latter mapping strongly depends on the orientation of the deformation tensor with respect to the line of sight @xmath24 .    in fig .",
    "[ sergei ] , we show an example of the density evolution of of a fluid element , with the eigenvalues today ( @xmath56 ) of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "two cases are considered : when the line of sight is aligned with the axis of fastest collapse ( @xmath59 ) ( short dashed line ) , and when the line of sight is aligned with the eigenvector associated with @xmath60 ( long dashed line ) .",
    "the evolution of the real - space density is shown as a solid line .",
    "the real - space density formally diverges at @xmath56 because of caustic - formation .",
    "the redshift - space density tends to become nonlinear even earlier . in particular , this redshift - space amplification works most efficiently if the axis of the fastest collapse is aligned with the line of sight .",
    "what we have here can be interpreted as a nonlinear manifestation of the linear effect noticed by kaiser ( 1987 ) .",
    "note how the redshift - space density decreases after ( redshift- ) caustic formation ( at @xmath61 , for the short dashed line ) .",
    "this corresponds to the free - crossing of redshift - space multiple - streams , which counteracts the kaiser compression of structures along the line of sight .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that eq .",
    "( [ rhoz3 ] ) only gives us a local picture of the density distribution .",
    "as in the familiar case of the za in real - space , our local lagrangian treatment suggests an anisotropic structure , except that the structure is preferentially transverse to the line of sight .",
    "however , it should be cautioned that the above equations tell us nothing about the global distribution of these local structures , whether they are aligned in a filament or a sheet is actually determined by the correlation function of shear ( see ) .",
    "moreover , small - scale velocity dispersions are likely to at least smear out the caustics , which we will come back to later .",
    "the only situation in which we can say something about the global distribution of structures using our local lagrangian description is for a truncated initial power spectrum , in other words with a displacement field that is smoothed on large scales in lagrangian space , similar to what is done in the truncated zeldovich approximation ( ) .",
    "the lagrangian pdf of ( redshift - space ) density is : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the dirac delta function , @xmath64 in its argument is a function of @xmath65 and @xmath45 as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ rhoz3 ] ) , @xmath66 is given by eq .",
    "( [ pei ] ) , and @xmath67 is the probability that a given lagrangian element has the set of eigenvalues @xmath50 s falling in the prescribed ranges .",
    "in other words , @xmath68 tells us the fraction of the lagrangian volume that has the redshift - space density @xmath69 .    to obtain the redshift - space pdf of the ( redshift - space ) density , two effects need to be taken into account .",
    "the redshift - space pdf is supposed to tell us the fraction of the redshift space volume that has the redshift - space density within a particular range , say @xmath69 .",
    "the first effect arises from the fact that the lagrangian and redshift - space pdfs differ by a multiplicative volume factor : a given lagrangian volume corresponds to a different redshift - space volume .",
    "this factor is none other than @xmath12 itself . in other words ,",
    "the redshift - space pdf should be equal to the lagrangian pdf divided by @xmath12 .",
    "if there were no multiple - streaming , this would be the whole story .",
    "the second effect that has to be taken into account is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ qsmap ] .",
    "multiple - streaming is said to occur in places where the mapping from @xmath37 to @xmath20 is no longer one - to - one .",
    "the expression for @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ rhoz ] ) is defined for every lagrangian coordinate @xmath37 . in other words , it is a single - stream redshift - space density . in regions where multiple - streaming occurs ,",
    "the actual redshift - space density , at a particular @xmath20 say , should be a sum of @xmath12 s over all @xmath37 s that map onto the same @xmath20 .",
    "such a non - local calculation is beyond the scope of this paper . instead , following kofman et al .",
    "@xcite , we assume the fraction of the total redshift - space volume that is occupied by these multiple - stream - regions is not large ( i.e. mildly nonlinear regime ) . however , there are inevitably some such regions .",
    "a renormalizing factor @xmath70 is then needed when computing the redshift - space pdf : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is given in eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) and @xmath73    the factor of @xmath74 takes care of the first effect mentioned above : it is the ratio of redshift - space volume to lagrangian - space volume . however",
    ", since @xmath75 is the single - stream redshift - space density , an overcounting of the total redshift - space volume over the total lagrangian - space volume occurs .",
    "the true ratio of the two should be unity .",
    "@xmath70 gives the ratio of the total _ single - stream _ redshift - space volume to the total lagrangian - space volume ( the latter is also equal to the true total redshift - space volume with no overcounting ) , which is in general larger than @xmath76 because of multiple - streaming ( or , in other words , overcounting ) .",
    "this quantity provides the correct renormalizing factor for @xmath77 .",
    "an additional bonus of the above formalism is that we have a quantitative measure of the degree of multiple - streaming in @xmath70 .",
    "it tells us the average number of streams at an arbitrary point in redshift - space .",
    "[ qsmap ] provides a nice illustration of how @xmath70 should be interpreted .",
    "suppose @xmath78 is the total true ( no overcounting ) volume in redshift - space ( i.e. the `` volume '' shown on the y - axis ) .",
    "suppose further that @xmath79 is the part of @xmath78 that is in single - stream regions , and @xmath80 is the part that is in triple - stream regions i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "recall that @xmath70 is the ratio of the total _ single - stream _ redshift - space volume to the total true redshift - space volume , which means @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the probabilities that a given region is in single - stream and triple - stream regimes respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath70 is exactly what one would refer to as the average number of streams at a point in redshift - space .",
    "obviously , the argument extends to higher ( but always odd ) number of streams .",
    "note furthermore that while eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) gives only an approximate redshift - space pdf in the limit of little multiple - streaming ( @xmath70 close to 1 ) , eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) is an exact expression for the average number of streams , at least within the framework of the za .",
    "this should be kept in mind in the discussion of the next section .",
    "lastly , note that the above expressions ( eq . [ [ rhoz3 ] ] , [ [ pl ] ] , [ [ pz ] ] , [ [ ns ] ] ) reduce to their real - space counterparts in the limit @xmath85 , in other words , when the real to redshift - space mapping is trivial .",
    "the quantities we are interested in are @xmath86 and @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) .",
    "both of them require performing the integral in eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) .",
    "kofman et al .",
    "@xcite succeeded in reducing the analog of this integral in real - space ( i.e. setting @xmath85 in eq .",
    "[ [ rhoz3 ] ] ) to a one - dimensional integral which has to be done numerically .",
    "redshift - space distortions introduce extra complications .",
    "we will instead perform the integral in eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) numerically right from the beginning .",
    "the delta function restriction @xmath87 $ ] is most easily dealt with using monte carlo techniques ( see for a similar calculation in the context of the pdf of the optical depth rather than the density in redshift - space ) . in other words , we generate realizations of @xmath50 s and @xmath45 s , and identify combinations of them which satisfy the delta function restriction .",
    "the directional unit vector @xmath45 is easily handled because it is randomly distributed over the 2-sphere , with the probability distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ pei ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the probability distribution for the @xmath50 s is somewhat more complicated .",
    "the probability distribution of the eigenvalues of the displacement matrix @xmath46 , for a gaussian random field , was first calculated by doroshkevich @xcite .",
    "we adopt a form for this distribution which is better suited for the monte carlo computation outlined above ( following ; see also ) .",
    "let @xmath88 s be the eigenvalues of the displacement matrix @xmath46 , and let @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 be variables defined through @xmath50 s as follows @xmath92 = { \\delta\\over 2 } { \\rm cos \\gamma } [ 1,1,1 ] + { \\delta\\over \\sqrt{5}}{\\rm sin}\\gamma [ { \\rm cos}({{\\alpha+2\\pi}\\over 3 } ) , { \\rm cos}({{\\alpha-2\\pi}\\over 3 } ) , { \\rm cos}({\\alpha \\over 3 } ) ] \\ , , \\label{angles}\\ ] ] where the @xmath89 ranges from @xmath93 to infinity , and both @xmath90 and @xmath91 are between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "this is shown as a function of @xmath6 ( eq . [ plambda ] ) , the rms amplitude of the linear real - space density fluctuation , for three different values of @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath106 case corresponds to the average number of streams in real - space .",

    "first , redshift - space distortion , or peculiar motion , has the effect of increasing the amount of multiple - streaming over that in real - space .",

    "this means multiple - streaming can be insignificant in real - space , but going on in earnest in redshift - space",
    ". might not seem too different from @xmath110 .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind this means , at any given point in redshift - space , one finds on the average @xmath111 streams . in other words ,",
    "the total single - stream redshift - volume is @xmath112 higher than the total true redshift - volume . ] in other words , even at relatively small @xmath6 , when the real - space density field is quite linear , redshift - space distortion introduces inherently non - perturbative effects through multiple - streaming .",
    "the above result perhaps explains the success of perturbation theory , which is by nature a single - stream theory , in estimating various statistics of the density field in real - space , at @xmath0 ( many references should be cited here , see and for short reviews .",
    "see also and for loop corrections which can be important at large enough @xmath6 . ) .",
    "the same does not appear to be true for statistics of the redshift - space density field , however .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that the linear - theory redshift distortion factor deduced by kaiser @xcite fails to describe the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio of the redshift - space power spectrum even at very large scales ( see hatton & cole and references therein for a recent discussion ) .",
    "this failure is an indication of the importance of non - perturbative effects such as those due to multiple - streaming in redshift - space .",
    "the fact that multiple - streaming in real - space is less severe than multiple - streaming in redshift - space has another interesting implication .",
    "recall the lagrangian to real - space to redshift - space mapping : @xmath113 .",
    "the multiple-(lagrangian)-streaming in redshift - space arises not so much from the @xmath114 mapping ( otherwise , the average number of lagrangian streams in real - space would not be so close to @xmath76 for , say , @xmath107 ) , but rather from the @xmath115 mapping .",
    "this is interesting because the multiple - streams at a given @xmath20 then mostly come from distinct places in real space i.e. they do not interact strongly , unlike the case of multiple-(lagrangian)-streams at the same @xmath116 .",
    "one well - known failure of the zeldovich approximation is that it does not account for the gravitational interaction between different lagrangian streams around a real - space caustic i.e. the different streams ( unphysically ) freely go past each other at a zeldovich pancake . around a redshift - space caustic ,",
    "however , the multiple streams can ( approximately ) free - stream past each other because they are not located at the same real - space location .",
    "this might provide a mechanism for partially canceling the line - of - sight compression of structures pointed out by kaiser ( 1987 ) .",
    "we compute the pdf of redshift - space density according to eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) for @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and for 2 different @xmath6 s : the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ zapdf ] .",
    "the @xmath118 curves correspond also to the pdfs of the real - space density .",
    "we have chosen @xmath6 s small enough so that the average number of streams is close to @xmath76 ( see fig . [ avestream ] ) .",
    "this is to ensure the validity of the approximation involved in eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that peculiar motion has the effect of making the pdf look more nonlinear in redshift - space than it is in real - space .",
    "this should be expected based on the kaiser @xcite effect alone : large scale coherent infall into initial density enhancements ( in real - space ) shifts such regions further out into the high - density tail of the pdf , while at the same time creating lower - density voids thereby making the pdf peak at lower densities .    at higher @xmath6 s , translinear distortions , or redshift - space multiple - streaming ,",
    "would start to cancel the kaiser compression , and begin to cause dilution around the initial density enhancements . at",
    "still higher @xmath6 s , a qualitatively different dilution effect , the finger - of - god , kicks in due to the formation of virialized clusters .",
    "this happens after multiple - streaming becomes important in real - space .",
    "unfortunately , the pdf as expressed in ( [ rhoz3 ] ) is incapable of taking multiple - streaming ( in either redshift or real - space ) properly into account , as we have explained in  [ formalism ] .",
    "nonetheless , we will attempt to probe into the regime of multiple - streaming by considering the effect of caustics on the high @xmath12 tail of the pdf in  [ smoothing ] .",
    "how good is the za - predicted pdf as a description of the true pdf ?",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ simpdfv ] a comparison of the za pdf versus the pdf measured from an @xmath117 cdm simulation , for two different output times , smoothed at the same comoving scale .",

    "the reader is referred to the hydra consortium ( http://coho.astro.uwo.ca/pub/data.html ; see also ) for further details of the simulation .",
    "the one free parameter we have to fix for the za prediction is the linear fluctuation amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "it can be seen that , as expected , @xmath6 is always smaller than the fluctuation amplitude of the evolved - and - smoothed density field , which we call @xmath122 .",
    "we also show lognormal distributions which reproduce the evolved fluctuation amplitude of the simulation outputs .",
    "in other words , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is chosen to equal @xmath125 .",

    "the same phenomenon has been observed in real - space for a similar cosmological model ( ) . the error - bars are estimated by dividing the box into 4 different subsamples , and computing the dispersion .",
    "it should be emphasized that we have purposefully chosen outputs , with suitable smoothing , that are only mildly nonlinear , so that the average number of lagrangian streams is very close to @xmath76 , making eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) a good approximation .",
    "the overall agreement between the za pdf and the n - body data is decent at these low values of @xmath126 .",

    "it is in fact well - known that the za pdf has a long tail of @xmath127 , due to the presence of caustics .",
    "this is true in both real and redshift - space .",
    "it implies that , unfortunately , @xmath126 has to be left as a free parameter in the above comparison because the za pdf does not yield a well - defined @xmath122 .",
    "we will revisit this issue in  [ smoothing ] .",
    "the methodology outlined in  [ method ] can be easily adopted to compute other one - point statistics , such as @xmath1 : @xmath128 as in the case of @xmath122 , because of the caustic - induced tail of the za pdf , @xmath1 is , strictly speaking , undefined except in the limit of vanishing @xmath6 .",
    "the finite number of realizations used in our monte carlo method provides a natural regularization by truncating at some high @xmath12 s , thereby giving a finite @xmath1 .",
    "as one decreases the input parameter @xmath6 in the monte carlo integration , the output @xmath1 converges eventually to the correct za predicted value for infinitesimal @xmath6 .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ s3tab ] ( see also e.g. for the real - space za prediction ) .",
    "we find that the rate of convergence for @xmath5 , @xmath129 , etc becomes progressively slower , and so we only give the @xmath1 values here .",
    "it can be seen that peculiar motion tends to slightly increase @xmath1 over its real - space value , as the reader might have guessed from the pdfs shown in fig .",
    "[ zapdf ] .",
    "this behavior is consistent with what is found by hivon et el .",
    "@xcite in the case of the exact dynamics , in the small @xmath6 limit .",
    "however , as is well - known in the case of real - space , in the perturbative limit , the za systematically gives lower @xmath1 than the exact dynamics .    as emphasized by hivon et al .",
    "@xcite , the perturbative prediction breaks down even at relatively small @xmath6 s ( say @xmath130 ) , or large smoothing scales , and the actual n - body @xmath1 is generally _ smaller _ in redshift - space than in real - space .",
    "they attributed it to some kind of finger - of - god effect on large scales , which we view as in part due to multiple - streaming in redshift - space ( that is distinct from the familiar small - scale finger - of - god ) .",
    "unfortunately , the za yields a meaningful skewness only in the vanishing @xmath6 limit , making it difficult to investigate the impact of these effects on @xmath1 .      why does the za pdf predict a long high-@xmath12 tail , and why is it not observed in n - body simulations , at least for cdm - type models ?",
    "we believe the answer to the latter at least in part has to do with smoothing due to finite resolution or discreteness as well as small - scale velocity dispersions . but let us first briefly review where the high @xmath12 tail comes from . the reader is referred to shandarin & zeldovich @xcite for a review .",
    "most of our arguments below apply equally well to real - space caustics .",
    "a caustic is located at a point where @xmath12 or @xmath131 diverges . as zeldovich @xcite originally argued , this is generically due to the vanishing of only one of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath132 .",
    "hence , we can focus our attention on the direction that aligns with the eigenvector associated with the vanishing eigenvalue .",
    "we will denote the relevant one - dimensional coordinates simply by @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ qsmap ] .",
    "taylor expanding @xmath133 as a function of @xmath134 around @xmath135 ( corresponding to @xmath136 where the caustic is ) , one can see that to the lowest order , @xmath133 is a quadratic function of @xmath134 i.e. @xmath137    in other words , @xmath12 should fall off as @xmath138 or @xmath139 , around the caustic .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , @xmath12 should be given by the sum over the contribution from each multiple - stream around the caustic ( as in the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ qsmap ] ) , but the singularity due to @xmath138 or @xmath139 dominates .",
    "note also that this singular behavior of @xmath12 occurs only on one side of the caustic in @xmath133-space .    to understand the caustic s influence on the pdf ,",
    "the crucial point to remember is that one has equal probability of locating at any position in @xmath133-space with respect to the location of the caustic .",
    "therefore , @xmath140 , with @xmath141 independent of @xmath133 , from which the @xmath127 behavior follows .",
    "the premise is that asymptotically high @xmath12 s occur only around caustics .",
    "we believe the answer lies in final ( as opposed to initial or lagrangian ) smoothing .",
    "there are two sources of final smoothing : one due to finite resolution or the discrete nature of the simulations ( or observations ) , and the other due to smearing by small - scale velocity dispersions .",
    "two conditions have to be met for the caustic - induced high @xmath12 tail to survive these kinds of inevitable smoothing in @xmath133-space .",
    "first , it is important that the scale of the caustic in @xmath133-space , @xmath142 , is larger than the smoothing scale , @xmath143 , where the smoothing scale can be taken to be whichever is dominant of the two kinds of smoothing mentioned above @xmath144 .",
    "the smoothing scale @xmath145 is associated with the finite final resolution , and @xmath146 is the velocity dispersion along the line of sight .",
    "the scale of the caustic in @xmath133-space is related to its counterpart in @xmath134-space by eq .",
    "( [ sqc ] ) : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the scale of the caustic in @xmath134-space . a good definition for @xmath148 is given by the magnitude of @xmath149 such that the next higher order term ignored in eq .",
    "( [ sqc ] ) becomes significant .",
    "in other words , @xmath150^{-1 } [ \\partial^2 s / \\partial q^2]$ ] .",
    "one can use even higher order terms for its definition , but it would not affect our arguments below .      the second condition has to do with the density profile of a smoothed caustic .",
    "assume that the first condition above is met , the smoothed profile of the caustic would be given by @xmath152 where @xmath153 is some dimensionless profile which , at its peak , is equal to @xmath154 .",
    "this is a very generic prediction quite independent of the form or origin of the smoothing .",
    "this means the smoothed caustic peaks at @xmath155 .",
    "now , if one would like such a smoothed caustic to contribute to the high @xmath12 tail , it is important that @xmath156 .",
    "hence , the second condition for the survival of the caustic - induced feature in the pdf is : @xmath157      therefore , the only remaining question is what the typical @xmath159 should be .",
    "this can be estimated using the definition suggested before : that @xmath148 is given by @xmath160^{-1}$ ] @xmath161 $ ] evaluated at the caustic .",
    "one can calculate exactly what the average value of this ratio should be , for gaussian initial conditions , imposing the constraint that the first derivative vanishes .",
    "all one needs is the joint probability distribution of all the derivatives up to the third one _ at a single point_. however , there is no need to do any calculation .",
    "the only relevant scale in this problem is the _ initial _ smoothing scale of the density field ( or the displacement field ) in @xmath134-space , let us call it @xmath162",
    ". therefore @xmath163 .    for cdm - type power spectra ,",
    "the initial smoothing scale @xmath164 is of the order of a few grid - spacings ( unless the initial power spectrum is deliberately smoothed or truncated ) , while the final smoothing scale @xmath165 is at least also a few grid - spacings ( and probably even larger due to small - scale velocity dispersions ) .",
    "this implies the condition in eq .",
    "( [ condition3 ] ) is never met , hence explaining why the theoretical caustic - induced tail of the pdf is not observed , at least in cdm simulations . in other words , to understand the high-@xmath12 behavior of the pdf properly , both multiple - streaming and smoothing have to be properly taken into account .",
    "this also points to a weakness of the calculation presented in  [ formalism ] .",
    "because final smoothing in @xmath133-space is not taken into account in the formalism , effects like what is discussed above are missed .",
    "we hope to pursue improvement of the calculation in this direction in the future .      using the zeldovich approximation",
    ", we find that peculiar motion significantly raises the degree of multiple - streaming .",
    "we quantify this by computing the average number of lagrangian - streams in both real and redshift - space . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ avestream ] , multiple - streaming can be insignificant in real - space , but non - negligible in redshift - space , even at moderate values of @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that most of the multiple - streaming in redshift - space arises from the @xmath166 mapping ( real or eulerian to redshift - space ) , rather than from the @xmath167 mapping ( lagrangian to eulerian space ) .    that the level of nonlinearity is amplified by the real to redshift - space mapping implies non - perturbative effects have to be taken into account in the calculation of redshift distortions , even on scales where the real - space density field is relatively linear .",
    "an interesting feature of redshift - space multiple - streaming is that redshift - space multiple - streams can freely flow past each other , unlike their real - space counterparts .",
    "this counteracts the familiar large scale compression of structures along the redshift direction first pointed out by kaiser ( 1987 ) , but it is physically distinct from the stretching of structures due to virialized motions on small scales .",
    "this might offer an explanation of why , even on relatively large scales , linear theory overpredicts the amount of reshift - space squashing of the two - point function along the line of sight . to make this quantitative , however",
    ", requires a detailed calculation , which we will discuss briefly below .",
    "we have computed also using the za the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of density , as well as @xmath1 , in both real and redshift - space . at the largest scales , or small @xmath6",
    "limit , @xmath1 does not appear to change significantly from real to redshift - space , consistent with the finding of hivon et al .",
    "we have compared the za pdf with that measured from a cdm n - body simulation ( fig [ simpdfv ] ) .",
    "we find that the pdf in redshift - space is well - fit by a lognormal distribution , similar to its counter - part in real - space ( ) . this suggests the pdf in both real and redshift - space can be described by a single - parameter family of functions ( @xmath124 in eq .",
    "[ [ plognorm ] ] ) .",
    "this is certainly worth exploring with more n - body simulations and different cosmological models ( see ) .",
    "the simulation pdf reveals no caustic - induced high @xmath12 tail , contrary to the za prediction .",
    "the same has been observed before in real - space as well ( ) .",
    "we argue in  [ smoothing ] that this is at least in part due to the fact that final smoothing in redshift - space ( or real - space ) is not taken into account in our formalism .",
    "smoothing naturally arises because of finite resolution or discreteness , as well as due to small - scale velocity dispersions .",
    "we give the criterion for the survival of the caustic feature through smoothing in eq .",
    "( [ condition3 ] ) : the final - smoothing scale has to be smaller than the lagrangian - smoothing scale .    in practice , we expect caustics to be efficiently erased by final - smoothing , unless the initial power spectrum is sufficiently smoothed or truncated .",
    "this is reminiscent of a related situation in gravitational lensing : that caustic features can only be observed if the source - size is sufficiently small .",
    "as mentioned before , a proper treatment of the statistics of the density field in redshift - space requires tackling the issues of multiple - streaming and final - smoothing .",
    "while such a calculation is beyond the scope of the present paper , taylor & hamilton @xcite and fisher & nusser @xcite have already made significant progress in using the za to compute the quadrupole - to - monopole ratio of the redshift - space power spectrum .",
    "they use the following expression for the fourier transform of the redshift - space density : @xmath168 where @xmath169 as a function of @xmath37 is the displacement from the lagrangian position @xmath37 to the redsfhit - space position @xmath170 .",
    "it comes from the following basic equation for the redshift - space density : @xmath171 , which implicitly allows for multiple - streaming by automatically summing over density contributions from all possible streams .",
    "the key here is that the mapping from real to redshift - space is treated exactly , instead of perturbatively , hence the non - perturbative nature of the redshift - space density field is taken into accout even if the real - space density field is still quite linear .",
    "these authors find that the za predicts the right - shape for the quadrupole to monopole ratio but underestimates the zero - crossing scale ( see also hatton & cole ) .",
    "one can take their treatment one step further by using approximations that are closer to the exact dynamics ( see e.g. scoccimarro ) .",
    "whatever the approach , it appears likely that , because of the prominence of multiple - streaming in redshift - space , a pure perturbative calculation would be inadequate .",
    "non - perturbative effects such as those due to multiple - streaming ( or even pre - multiple - streaming ) have to be taken into account explicitly .",
    "lastly , our lagrangian analysis here still leaves open the question of how the local pancakes or caustics are spatially distributed globally , whether they preferentially lie along filaments or sheets .",
    "calculations have shown that filamentary structures in real - space are preferred for gaussian initial conditions ( e.g. , ) .",
    "it remains to be seen how the redshift - space mapping might alter this picture .",
    "our local calculation , however , does provide a valid description of the global distribution of structures if the initial power spectrum is sufficiently smoothed , as is done in the truncated zeldovich approximation .",
