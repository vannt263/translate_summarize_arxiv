    "if the restrictions are imposed on the components of spinor field only , it becomes massless and invariants constructed from bilinear spinor forms also become trivial . imposing restriction wholly on metric functions one obtains frw model , while if the restrictions are imposed both on metric functions and spinor field components , the initially bi model becomes locally rotationally symmetric .",
