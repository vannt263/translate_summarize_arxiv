    "estimates on mixed norm spaces @xmath0 ( see definition  [ definition : mixed norm spaces ] ) already appeared in the works of gagliardo @xcite and nirenberg @xcite , to prove an endpoint case of the classical sobolev embeddings .",
    "however , a more systematic approach to these spaces was first shown explicitly by fournier @xcite .",
    "recall that the sobolev space @xmath1 @xmath2 consists of all functions in @xmath3 whose first - order distributional derivatives also belong to @xmath4 we write @xmath5 for the closure of smooth function , with compact support , in @xmath6    the classical sobolev embedding theorem claims that @xmath7 sobolev @xcite proved this embedding for @xmath8 but his method , based on integral representations , did not work when @xmath9 that case was settled affirmatively by gagliardo @xcite and nirenberg  @xcite , who first observed that @xmath10 and then , using an iterated form of hlder s inequality , completed the proof ; i.e. , @xmath11    later , a new approach based on properties of mixed norm spaces was introduced by fournier @xcite and was subsequently developed , via different methods , by various authors , including blei @xcite , milman @xcite , algervik and kolyada @xcite and kolyada @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "the central part of fournier s work was to prove @xmath12 and then taking into account , he obtained the following improvement of : @xmath13 the embedding is due to poornima @xcite , and it can be also traced in the work of peetre @xcite ( the case @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , and kerman and pick @xcite , where a characterization of sobolev embeddings in rearrangement invariant ( r.i . ) spaces was obtained .",
    "since the embedding was first proved , many other proofs and different extensions have appeared in the literature . in particular , relations between mixed norm spaces of lorentz spaces were studied in @xcite , where it was shown , for instance , @xmath16    all these works provide us a strong motivation to better understand the embeddings between mixed norm spaces , as well as to provide a characterization of for more general r.i .",
    "spaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . a precise definition of r.i . spaces , and also other definitions and properties concerning function spaces to be used throughout the paper can be found in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] .",
    "in section  [ mixed norm spaces ] we introduce the benedek - panzone spaces and the mixed norm spaces . here , among other things , we find an explicit formula for the peetre @xmath17-functional for the couple of mixed norm spaces @xmath18    in section  [ section : embeddings between mixed norm spaces ] , we explore connections between mixed norm spaces .",
    "it is important to observe that , for any @xmath19 @xmath20 ( see lemma  [ lema : inclusion the benedek - panzone spaces ] ) . that is , looking at each specific component , the embeddings are trivial .",
    "however , there are examples , for instance , showing that if in we replace benedek - panzone spaces by the global mixed norm spaces , then the corresponding equivalence is not longer true .",
    "this fact illustrates that mixed norm spaces may have a much more complicated structure than benedek - panzone spaces .",
    "therefore , it is natural to analyze embeddings between mixed norm spaces .",
    "motivated by this problem we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the following types of embeddings : @xmath21 after this discussion our analysis focuses on a particular embedding : @xmath22 to be more specific , theorem  [ teo : rango r(x1,loo)->r(x2,l1 ) ] provides a characterization of the smallest mixed norm space of the form @xmath23 in , once the mixed norm space @xmath24 is given .",
    "to finish , we make some comments for the case when @xmath25 is replaced by @xmath26 ( see also @xcite ) .    section  [ section : fournier embeddings ] is devoted to the study of the embedding for more general r.i . spaces .",
    "in particular , theorem   [ theorem : mixta inclusion r(x , loo)->z ] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the following embedding to hold : @xmath27 a general consequence of theorem  [ theorem : mixta inclusion r(x , loo)->z ] is contained in theorem  [ theorem : dominio r(x , loo)->z ] , which provides a characterization of the largest space of the form @xmath28 in , once the r.i .",

    ", we will assume that @xmath350 .",
    "[ lemma : optimal range norm r(x , loo)->r(y , l1 ) ]",
    "let @xmath133 be an r.i .",
    "space , with @xmath351 .",
    "then , the functional defined by @xmath352 is an r.i . norm .",
    "the positivity and homogeneity of @xmath353 are clear .",
    "next , let @xmath48 and @xmath50 be measurable functions on @xmath42 then , @xmath354 since @xmath355 ( cf .",
    "* theorem ii.3.4 ) ) , hardy - littlewood - plya principle implies that @xmath356    the proof of ( a2)-(a4 ) and ( a6 ) for @xmath353 requires only the corresponding axioms for @xmath357 hence we shall omit them .",
    "finally , to prove property ( a5 ) , we fix any @xmath358 then , @xmath359    [ teo : rango r(x1,loo)->r(x2,l1 ) ] let @xmath360 let @xmath133 be an r.i .",
    "space and let @xmath361 be as in . then , the embedding @xmath362 holds .",
    "moreover , @xmath363 is the smallest space of the form @xmath364 that verifies .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : optimal range norm r(x , loo)->r(y , l1 ) ] gives us that @xmath361 is an r.i .",
    "space equipped with the norm @xmath365",
    "now , let us see that the embedding holds .",
    "in fact , if @xmath366 then , combining @xmath367 with the embedding and using theorem  [ interpolkf ] , we deduce that @xmath368 hence , using lemma  [ lemma : lower bound for k - functional ] and theorem  [ theorem : k - functional of r(x , loo ) and loo ] , we get @xmath369 so , using the hardy - littlewood inequality and the subadditivity of @xmath357 we get @xmath370 for any @xmath371 therefore , the embedding @xmath372 holds , as we wanted to see .",
    "now , let us prove that @xmath363 is the smallest r.i .",
    "space for which holds .",
    "that is , let us see that if a mixed norm space @xmath364 satisfies @xmath373 then @xmath374 we assume that @xmath242 with @xmath295 and @xmath245 given any function @xmath375 with @xmath376 we define @xmath377 we fix @xmath378 then , @xmath379 and @xmath300 , otherwise .",

    "the general case can be proved as in the proof of theorem  [ teo : mixta inclusion r(x1,y1)->r(x2,y2 ) ] .",
    "thus , we have @xmath393 , and so , lemma  [ lema : inclusion norma mixta ] implies that the embedding holds , as we wanted to see .",
    "theorem  [ teo : rango r(x1,loo)->r(x2,l1 ) ] can be extended to the case @xmath15 as follows : if we define @xmath394 , then with a similar proof one can get @xmath395 although this embedding is not optimal in general . for example , with @xmath396 then @xmath397 , but in this case @xmath398 and clearly @xmath399 .    however , if @xmath400 , then gives @xmath401 which is indeed optimal ( as proved in @xcite ) .",
    "our main goal , in this section , is to study the following embedding @xmath402 in particular , we are interested in the following problems :    a.   given a mixed norm space @xmath403 we would like to find the largest r.i .",

    "now , let us suppose that holds .",
    "we fix any @xmath366 and @xmath422 then , for any @xmath19 it holds that @xmath423 so , we get @xmath424 hence , corollary  [ corollary : distribution and essential projection ] , with @xmath425 replaced by @xmath426 implies that @xmath427 for any @xmath428 as a consequence , @xmath429 therefore , we obtain @xmath430 thus , we have @xmath431 hence , using , we get @xmath432 that is , the embedding @xmath433 holds and the proof is complete .",
    "let @xmath29 be an r.i .",
    "now , we want to find the largest space of the form @xmath28 satisfying @xmath434 in order to do this , let us introduce a new space , denoted by @xmath435 , consisting of those functions @xmath436 for which the quantity @xmath437 is finite .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that @xmath435 is an r.i .",

    "the embedding follows from theorem  [ theorem : mixta inclusion r(x , loo)->z ] .",
    "thus , to complete the proof , it only remains to see that @xmath444 is the largest domain space of the form @xmath28 corresponding to @xmath29 .",

    "space @xmath29 satisfies @xmath466",
    "then @xmath467 as before , assume that @xmath242 with @xmath409 and @xmath245 given any function @xmath468 with @xmath469 we define @xmath470 then , applying the same technique as in the proof of theorem  [ teo : mixta inclusion r(x1,y1)->r(x2,y2 ) ] and using the boundedness of the dilation operator in r.i .",
    "spaces , we get @xmath471 by hypothesis @xmath468 and hence @xmath472 so , using the embedding @xmath433 and we get @xmath473 but , @xmath50 and @xmath48 are equimeasurable functions , and hence we obtain @xmath474 from this , we obtain that any @xmath475 with @xmath469 belongs to @xmath404 the general case can be proved as in the proof of theorem  [ teo : mixta inclusion r(x1,y1)->r(x2,y2 ) ] .",
