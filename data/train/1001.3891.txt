    "ionising radiation from star - forming galaxies is a plausible primary source of cosmic reionisation .",
    "the amount , the evolution with redshift and its contribution to the cosmic reionisation is still a matter of debate ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , giallongo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , shapley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) [ s06 , hereafter ] , siana et al .",

    "2008 ) , iwata et al .",
    "( 2009 ) [ i09 , hereafter ] ) .",
    "malkan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and siana et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) have stacked tens of deep ultraviolet imaged galaxies at redshift @xmath1 1 and no detection has been reported .",
    "similarly , cowie et al . (",
    "2009 ) have combined @xmath1 600 galaxies observed with galex at the same redshift and also in this case the result was a non detection . at",
    "higher redshift ( z@xmath43 ) an escape of lyman continuum photons ( lyc hereafter ) seems to be detected in @xmath1 10% of the galaxies ( e.g. i09 and s06 ) , suggesting a possible evolution of the escape fraction with redshift .",
    "it is still unclear which is the typical escape fraction to be expected from starburst galaxies at redshift z@xmath03 .",
    "while some results of numerical simulations suggest low values ( less than 10% , e.g. gnedin et al . 2008 ) , others claim escape fraction as high as 80% ( e.g. , yajima et al . 2009 , razoumov & sommer - larsen 2009 ) .",
    "the two possibilities imply two completely different scenarios : in the first case high - redshift galaxies turn out to be inefficient in releasing ionising radiation into the intergalactic medium , conversely in the second case , they may play a dominant role in this redshift regime .",
    "as redshift increases , the probability of foreground contamination by blue galaxies that mimic the ionising radiation also increases .",
    "therefore it is important to study the contaminated systems and try to quantify their occurrence .",
    "the recent ultra deep vlt / vimos u - band observations in the goods - s field ( nonino et al .",
    "2009 ) allow to investigate this issue to unprecedented depth and to better calculate the probability of such contamination ( a comparison between the observed superpositions in the goods - s area and those expected is also performed ) .",
    "very deep exposures with exquisite spatial resolution , as the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf , beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) , make it possible to verify the results of such a calculation over limited areas of the sky .",
    "the work is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "2.1 the probability distributions of foreground superposition are calculated and in sect .",
    "2.2 it is compared to the observed direct detections reported in literature . in sect .",
    "2.3 the monte - carlo simulations are described to derive the integrated contribution of foreground sources . in sect .",
    "3 the u - band catalog is cross - matched to the redshift @xmath1 4 sample and checked for contamination .",
    "3.1 discuss the case of an exemplary @xmath8 lyc escape detection in the hudf .",
    "sect . 4 summarise the results .",
    "the standard cosmology is adopted ( @xmath9=70 @xmath10 , @xmath11=0.3 , @xmath12=0.7 ) .",
    "if not specified , magnitudes are given in ab system .",
    ".number counts derived from the ultradeep vlt / vimos catalog down to u @xmath1 30 ( 1@xmath5 limit within 1  aperture radius , nonino et al . 2009 ) .",
    "completeness correction has been roughly applied at magnitudes fainter than 28.5 ( @xmath13@xmath5 limit ) .",
    "the values in parenthesis have been calculated by extrapolating linearly the number counts up to u - mag 30.5 by fitting a straight line in the range u - mag 25  28 with a slope 0.2 in the [ @xmath13 vs. [ u - mag ] plan . [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      an example of @xmath8 detection of escape radiation of one of the b - band dropout galaxies discussed above is shown in the right panel of figure  [ escape ] . the clear detection in the u band is shown ( u magnitude 28.63@xmath60.2 ) at the position of the galaxy gds  j033236.83 - 274558.0 at redshift 3.797 . in the left panel of the same figure the colour image extracted from the hudf is shown .",
    "it is clearly visible a blue compact source superimposed on the @xmath14=3.797 galaxy slightly offset by @xmath150.4  ( this blue source is visible also in the acs / b435 and v606 bands ) .",
    "we note that the lbg and the blue source have been detected as a single galaxy in the hudf catalog by coe et al .",
    "if the blue spot is not a contaminant , then it would be an ultradeep , high resolution `` morphologically detected '' lyc case at high redshift .",
    "it is not clear what would be the morphological appearance of galaxies showing lyc escape photons at @xmath16 912 , however the system can be easily explained by the presence of a foreground source rather than a shifted `` hole '' where lyman photons can escape .",
    "therefore we favour the simpler interpretation of a superposition case .",
    "it is worth noting that this system would appear as a single source if observed with lower spatial resolution , as in the @xmath17 band or deep u image ( seeing 0.8 , where presumably the blue source is entirely contributing to the u - band detection ) .",
    "a deep spectroscopic or narrow band observation of this system with a seeing larger than 0.5  would detect a signal below 912  erroneously ascribed to the source at higher redshift .",
    "in particular , given the u mag of 28.63 and  = 24.67 the polluting source mimic an observed @xmath7 38 .",
    "this value is at least three times larger than the current lyc detections ( s06 and i09 ) , and comparable to the reported estimates of stacked spectra , i.e. 17.7 and 58 reported by steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and s06 , respectively .",
    "depending on the seeing conditions and/or the aperture sizes adopted to carry out the photometry / spectroscopy the contamination probability by foreground blue sources on the estimation of the ionising radiation may not be negligible .",
    "in particular in the cases reported by s06 and i09 it turns out that the probability of foreground contamination for at least half of the direct lyc detections is @xmath1 30% and 50% , respectively . among the direct lyc detections in i09",
    "there are cases of spatially offset emission ( in the case of lbgs ) and cases of extremely high escape fraction ( even larger than unity ) .",
    "we argue that , other than a possible complex physical explanations ( e.g. inoue 2009 ) , these suspicious systems should be better investigated with higher resolution and multi - band imaging , since they are statistically compatible with superposition effects .",
    "also in the case of statistical lyc detection the foreground contamination plays a role in the global result .",
    "a stacking process increases the signal to noise of the possible true lyc emission , but at the same time a bias by foreground faint sources ( not detected individually ) may arise .",
    "the issue has been addressed by computing monte - carlo simulations from which , taking advantage of the ultradeep vlt / vimos u - band number counts ( nonino et al . 2009 ) , we calculated the median contribution of foreground sources to the residual flux measure below the lyman limit . from these calculations it turns out that the current estimations of lyc emission from stacked spectra at redshift @xmath13 are beyond 2@xmath5 from the expected median foreground contribution .",
    "_ the simple foreground contamination may not entirely explain the cases of direct escape fraction observed or the limits derived from the stacking , nevertheless the calculations and the examples here reported demonstrate the need for caution in lyc measurements at high redshift_. this systematic error has to be considered when attempting to measure the lyc escape fraction and its evolution with redshift and the contribution of galaxies to the uv background .",
    "for example , from simulations it turns out that the corrected observed @xmath3 flux reported by s06 would be @xmath1 1.61.9 times smaller than the reported value .",
    "differently , the correction for the steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimation is less effective ( a factor @xmath1 1.3 ) , since their residual flux is @xmath1 1 magnitude brighter than s06 .",
    "consequently the relative escape fractions are dimmed by the same factors .",
    "it is worth noting that in stacked images of tens and hundreds galaxies at redshift @xmath1 1 there is currently no direct detection ( cowie et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , siana et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2010 ) , malkan et al . (",
    "2003 ) ) . on the one hand",
    ", it may reflect indirectly the redshift distribution of the ( faint u - mag@xmath426 ) blue compact sources that populate the ultradeep u - band image .",
    "since not evident contaminations have been currently measured at redshift @xmath1 1 , the bulk of the ( faint ) blue compact sources would be at redshift @xmath4 1 .",
    "on the other hand , being these objects u - band detected , their typical redshift is most probably smaller than 3 ( i.e. they are not u - band @xmath18 ) . for the brighter part of the distribution ( u - mag@xmath1926.5 ) , a further constraint on the redshift comes from the music photometric redshift catalog ( grazian et al .",
    "2006 ) , from which they span the interval 0@xmath19z@xmath193 .",
    "conversely , in the case of lyc observations at z@xmath43 the contribution of such blue galaxies as contaminants largely increases . in general , the fraction of galaxies contaminated ranges between @xmath13 and @xmath115% , varying from seeing 0.5  to 1.0 , respectively , and assuming number counts down to u - mag@xmath128.5 . on the one hand simulations predict an evolution ( increase ) of the escape fraction with increasing redshift ( e.g. razoumov & sommer - larsen 2007 ) , on the other hand",
    "also the contamination by foreground sources it is expected to increase , with a more significant effect for fainter lbgs ( @xmath20 ) . therefore , if the contamination is not taken into account properly , the observational constraints on the evolution of the escape fraction may be biased , particularly at faint limits where the population of blue compact sources increases in number density . in order to produce a robust lyc measurements at z@xmath03 high spatial resolution , multi - band and ultradeep imaging are necessary to exclude the spurious cases .",
