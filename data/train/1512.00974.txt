    "@xmath21/@xmath22 is nearly independent of temperature below 20 k , indicating a nonmagnetic cef ground state with van vleck paramagnetism .",

    "a phase transition was detected by an anomaly near 2  k in the specific heat [ 5 ] .",

    "a single crystal of prti@xmath1al@xmath2 was synthesized by the al flux method [ 5 ] . for nmr measurements ,",
    "the crystal was shaped into a thin plate of the size 2.05 @xmath33 1.14 @xmath33 0.073 mm@xmath34 with the @xmath6 direction normal to the plate .",
    "there are two reasons for this . first",
    ", thinner plates give better signal intensity because the rf penetration depth is much shorter than the thickness .",
    "second , the geometry of a thin plate reduces the distribution of demagnetizing field , thereby resulting in a narrower nmr line width .",
    "the nmr spectra were obtained by summing the fourier transform of the spin - echo signals obtained at equally spaced rf frequencies with a fixed magnetic field of 6.615 t. the orientation of the crystal in the magnetic field was precisely controlled by double - axis goniometer typically within 0.2 degree .",
    "in general , the nmr resonance frequency is determined by the spacing of eigenvalues of the following hamiltonian @xmath35 the first term represents the zeeman interaction , where @xmath36 is the plank constant , @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the nuclear spin and @xmath39 is the gyromagnetic ratio ( 11.09407  mhz / t for @xmath0al ) .",

    "nmr spectrum of each site should consist of five resonance lines split by the quadrupole interaction .",
    "furthermore , crystallographically equivalent sites generally split into several inequivalent groups of sites in magnetic fields .",

    "this process also allowed us to make unique site assignment of observed resonance lines as indicated in figure 3 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    the al(1 ) site has a 3-fold symmetry along the @xmath6 direction . therefore the efg tensor is axially symmetric ( @xmath61 ) and the principal axis with the largest efg ( @xmath52 axis ) is parallel to the @xmath6 direction .",
    "there are four equivalent @xmath6 directions in the cubic crystal .",
