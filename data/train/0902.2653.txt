    "the experimental data presented are obtained with the same sample as used in reference @xcite . a device with the same gate pattern as used in the experiment is shown in fig .  [ esrdevice]a .",
    "the two coupled semiconductor quantum dots are defined by surface gates ( fig .",
    "[ esrdevice]a ) on top of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "the oscillating magnetic field that drives the spin transitions is generated by applying a radio - frequency ( rf ) signal generated by a rohde & schwarz smr40 source to an on - chip coplanar stripline ( cps ) which is terminated in a narrow wire , positioned near the dots and separated from the surface gates by a 100-nm - thick dielectric ( fig .",
    "[ esrdevice]b ) .",
    "the current through the wire generates an oscillating magnetic field @xmath96 at the dots , perpendicular to the static external field @xmath10 and slightly stronger in the left dot than in the right dot .",
    "characteristic impedance , @xmath97 , up to the shorted termination .",
    "it is separated from the gate electrodes by a 100-nm - thick dielectric ( calixerene).,width=377 ]    the gaas / algaas heterostructure from which the samples were made was purchased from sumitomo electric .",
    "the 2deg has a mobility of @xmath98  @xmath99vs at 77  k , and an electron density of @xmath100-@xmath101  @xmath102 , measured at 30  mk with a different device than used in the experiment .",
    "background charge fluctuations made the quantum dot behavior excessively irregular .",
    "the charge stability of the dot was improved considerably in two ways .",
    "first , the gates were biased by + 0.5  v relative to the 2deg during the device cool - down .",
    "next , after the device had reached base temperature , the reference of the voltage sources and i / v converter ( connected to the gates and the 2deg ) were biased by + 2  v. this is equivalent to a @xmath103  v bias of both branches of the cps , which therefore ( like a gate ) reduces the 2deg density under the cps .",
    "the measurements were performed in a oxford instruments kelvinox 400 ha dilution refrigerator operating at a base temperature of 35 - 40  mk .",
    "in both traces in fig .  2a in the main text , the nuclear bath is unpolarized at the onset of electron spin resonance . in the case of the upper panel , @xmath10",
    "is swept just before the measurement from 300  mt to @xmath104  mt in about 40  s. during this sweep the nuclear field relaxes ( typical relaxation time @xmath105 10  s ) or is even actively depolarized .",
    "residual polarization would be indicated by a shift of the zero field peak and the onset of esr response to a nominal non - resonant magnetic field , which is both not observed . in the case of the lower panel",
    "the magnetic field is swept from low to high magnetic field ( to 300  mt ) just before recording the trace . in this case",
    "there could be polarization still present at the beginning of the trace , however in that case that polarization relaxes much faster than the sweep rate of 60  mt / min , such that when reaching the resonant field the nuclear spin bath is equilibrated .",
    "and @xmath29 , i.e.  time - dependent and time - independent hyperfine coupling .",
    "we conclude that , under the present experimental conditions , the dominant mechanism involves time - dependent hyperfine coupling , energy dissipation by electron transport and internal spin relaxation causing an asymmetry in the populations of the electron spin states.,width=642 ]    here we describe how we identify the dominating process of hyperfine induced nuclear spin flips .",
    "the ` flip - flop ' terms @xmath33 in the hyperfine hamiltonian are responsible for the exchange of spin between the electron and the nuclei . however , as the nuclear zeeman splitting is 3 or 4 orders smaller than the electron splitting  @xcite , the states coupled by @xmath33 are roughly @xmath106 apart in energy .",
    "therefore , spin exchange is only allowed in a second - order process in which some other mechanism supplies or absorbs the excess zeeman energy .",
    "this energy difference may ( i ) be dissipated by an environment  @xcite , or ( ii ) be given to an electron tunneling out of the dot . in case ( i ) the environment , at sufficiently low temperatures , can only absorb energy , so that the electron zeeman energy can only be reduced .",
    "this results in the same sign of dnsp as with the usual overhauser effect  @xcite . in case",
    "( ii ) , owing to a voltage bias much larger than the zeeman energy , the change of energy in the course of a spin - flip can be of either sign . in this case , a preferential direction of dnsp will be determined by some other spin asymmetry of the system . such an asymmetry may arise from either ( ii.a ) a difference in spin - flip rates for different spin directions ( e.g.  due to different overlap between initial and final states ) , or ( ii.b ) different populations of the states with different spin directions ( e.g.  due to internal relaxation processes or differing decay rates ) .    apart from these three mechanisms , there are two more options to choose between : as mentioned in the main text , the a.c .  electrical component of the exciting field @xmath96 moves the electrons in the dots with respect to the nuclei , and this we account for by introducing a time - dependent component in the hyperfine coupling",
    ". the time - dependent and time - independent couplings will give rise to different flip rates , so this gives us in total six candidate mechanisms .",
    "let us first decide on the relative contributions of the time - dependent and time - independent hyperfine couplings , @xmath29 and @xmath54 .",
    "we compare the strength of second order transition rates , in both cases proportional to the coupling amplitude square and inversely proportional to the energy square of the virtual state . while for the time - independent coupling this energy is the electron zeeman energy @xmath107 , it is a much smaller energy for the resonant time - dependent coupling , involving the a.c .",
    "resonant magnetic field @xmath108 .",
    "therefore we have to compare the factors @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we estimate that for our conditions @xmath35 and @xmath111 , and conclude that the time - dependent coupling dominates .",
    "to decide upon the other three options mentioned above , we have to compare the spin exchange rates involving electron tunneling , characterized by the broadening of the @xmath2 singlet @xmath112 and the typical decay rate of the @xmath1 singlet @xmath113 , and internal spin relaxation within the dots , characterized by a rate @xmath114 $ ] , @xmath115 being the energy dissipated . for mechanism ( i )",
    "we find the scale @xmath116 $ ] , i.e.  spin relaxation dissipates the remaining energy difference @xmath117 . in case ( ii )",
    "the energy is dissipated during tunneling , which takes place with a rate @xmath118 , giving a scale for the nuclear spin flip rate of @xmath119 .",
    "this rate however is symmetric in spin direction , so to find a preferred direction of dnsp we need to include an asymmetry : ( ii.a ) the states are split by @xmath117 , so decay to the broadened @xmath2 singlet introduces a relative difference of @xmath120 in the rates , setting the scale of the dnsp rate @xmath121 .",
    "( ii.b ) internal spin relaxation competes with tunneling processes , causing an asymmetry in the population probabilities of the states of @xmath122/\\gamma_s$ ] resulting in @xmath123 $ ] for dnsp . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mech ] we give a schematic representation of these considerations .",
    "we show all mechanisms investigated and give the corresponding estimates of the scale of nuclear spin pumping .",
    "we estimate @xmath124  ev , @xmath125  ev , @xmath126  mhz , @xmath127  ev and @xmath128\\sim 100\\times\\gamma_r[e_\\text{rf}]\\sim 1 $ ]  mhz , resulting in the estimates for the scales of dnsp rate ( i ) @xmath129  hz , ( ii.a ) @xmath130  hz ,",
    "and ( ii.b ) @xmath131  hz . based on this argument we conclude that mechanism ( ii.b ) dominates : electric field assisted hyperfine flip - flops involve the absorption and emission of photons with energy @xmath132 . close to resonance this effectively reduces the energy mismatch of the states involved in a flip - flop from @xmath106 to the energy scale of the esr driving @xmath133 .",
    "since this energy mismatch is too small to result in a significant nuclear spin pumping rate based on a standard overhauser argument , another spin asymmetry is needed .",
    "internal electron spin relaxation provides this asymmetry : it causes the electron spin ground state to be ( slightly ) more populated than the excited state .",
    "this difference in populations combined with photon assisted hyperfine flip - flops ( which do not have a preferred direction ) results in dnsp parallel to the spin of the electron ground state .",
    "here we will elaborate further on the six steps of the theoretical consideration as sketched in the main text .",

    "such a decay process is followed by a charge transfer in the left junction @xmath146 , whereby all four basis states @xmath147 are re - initialized with equal rates @xmath148 .",
    "internal relaxation processes are due to coupling to an environment and involve energy dissipation of @xmath149  @xcite .",
