    "recently , the quantum properties of @xmath0 supersymmetric field theories have been under active investigation .",
    "in particular , seiberg and witten @xcite analyzed an asymptotically free @xmath2 yang - mills theory and determined the leading contribution of the low energy effective action for all values of the gauge coupling .",
    "it turns out that in the strong coupling region no massless @xmath2 gauge bosons exist ; instead magnetic monopoles become massless and the effective low energy theory is best described by a weakly coupled dual @xmath3 magnetic gauge theory .",
    "these developments lead to intensive attempts to uncover the same physical phenomenon in string theory and study its gravitational and `` stringy '' generalizations .",
    "it has been conjectured that for strongly coupled heterotic @xmath0 vacua the `` dual '' description is provided by weakly coupled @xmath0 vacua of type ii strings .",
    "this conjecture is supported by a number of concrete `` pairs '' of dual vacua @xcite where the perturbative effective action of the heterotic vacuum ( at least , for the vector multiplets ) has been matched with the dual type ii vacuum in an appropriate expansion @xcite .",
    "furthermore seiberg  witten theory should appear in this context @xcite and can be recovered in the @xmath4 limit @xcite .",
    "these encouraging results make it interesting to go beyond a model by model analysis and study more generally the properties of the conjectured duality .",
    "however , for an arbitrary heterotic string vacuum it is presently unknown how to construct the dual partner .",
    "one might suspect that this duality in 4 dimensions is a consequence of string - string duality @xcite in six dimensions and the dual pairs of @xcite are indeed constructed in this way .",
    "it is not clear how to show the connection for the pairs of @xcite however .",
    "initial steps in this latter case were taken in @xcite where it was noticed that both the type ii string and the heterotic string could be `` fibred '' over a @xmath5 .",
    "that is , the  manifold , @xmath6 , on which the type iia string was compactified could be written as a fibre bundle with base @xmath5 and generic fibre a k3 surface where the heterotic string was compactified on k3@xmath7 which can be written as a bundle with base @xmath5 and generic fibre @xmath8 .",
    "it is then tempting to try to use string - string duality fibre - wise to map the type iia string on the k3 surface into a heterotic string on @xmath8 .",
    "the relevance of k3-fibrations was first noticed in @xcite where it was shown that such a structure fits nicely with properties of the dual heterotic string compactified on k3@xmath9 .",
    "( various related aspects of k3-fibrations were also discussed in @xcite . ) in this paper we will take this point further and argue that the appearance of the k3-fibration is actually unavoidable .",
    "the argument will borrow results from the `` phase '' picture of the moduli space of @xmath0 conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , we need to understand clearly what we mean by an object that is recognizably a heterotic string and an object that is recognizably a type iia string theory compactified on a  manifold . in the latter case , we know from the phase picture that we need to identify a `` '' phase of the moduli space and we will see that we must also identify a `` weakly - coupled '' phase in the heterotic string moduli space .",
    "the phase picture allowed a complete resolution of the question of  manifolds without mirror partners @xcite .",
    "we will see that exactly the same considerations apply to heterotic strings without dual type ii partners and _ visa versa_. if we demand that we do have a dual pair in which the weakly - coupled phase of a heterotic string maps into the  phase of a type iia string then we will see that this  manifold must have a k3-fibration .",
    "one bound which appears naturally on the heterotic side is on the rank of the gauge group .",
    "one can use conformal field theory considerations to show that it can not exceed 24 .",
    "it has been troubling that no such bound is known on the type ii side .",
    "we will see how k3-fibrations give a natural interpretation to this effect although it appears that this bound can be broken by nonperturbative effects on the heterotic side .",
    "c    let us start by summarizing the generic properties of perturbative heterotic @xmath0 vacua .",
    "the heterotic string is based on a conformal field theory with central charge @xmath10 . out of this total central charge a @xmath11 `` block '' is used to build the four - dimensional space - time while the left over @xmath12 conformal field theory is only further constrained by the amount of space - time supersymmetry and the size of the gauge group .",
    "@xmath0 space - time supersymmetry requires that the right moving internal @xmath13 conformal field theory splits into a free complex boson ( of central charge @xmath14 ) and a @xmath15 conformal field theory with @xmath16 world - sheet supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the gauge group @xmath17 arises from the left moving @xmath18 conformal field theory and the free @xmath19 boson .",
    "the latter gives rise to two abelian @xmath3 gauge bosons which are identified with the graviphoton and the vector partner of the dilaton .",
    "the @xmath18 conformal field theory generates an arbitrary ( possibly non - abelian ) gauge group @xmath20 of maximal rank 22 .",
    "therefore @xmath21 ^ 2 $ ] and the rank of @xmath17 is bounded by @xmath22    the supersymmetric partners of the gauge bosons are two gauginos and a complex scalar all in the adjoint representation of @xmath17 ; they form what is called an @xmath0 vector multiplet .",
    "the matter fields usually transform in the fundamental representation of @xmath17 and they reside in @xmath0 hypermultiplets which contain two weyl fermions and four real scalars .",
    "all string vacua also feature gauge neutral scalars termed moduli which are exactly flat directions of the effective potential and which parameterize the perturbative degeneracy of a given vacuum family . such moduli arise as the scalars of either vector or hypermultiplets and they can be thought of as parameters taking values in a moduli space .",
    "@xmath0 supersymmetry implies that the moduli space @xmath23 is always locally a product @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is spanned by the scalars in the vector multiplets ( hypermultiplets ) .",
    "the scalar fields @xmath27 in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath20 are flat directions of the effective potential . if all @xmath28 s are turned on ( a generic point in the moduli space",
    ") @xmath20 is broken to its maximal abelian subgroup ( which is at most @xmath29^{22}$ ] ) while at special points in the moduli space this gauge symmetry can be enhanced to a non - abelian group .",
    "in addition to the @xmath28 moduli there is also always the string dilaton present in the massless spectrum .",
    "its vacuum expectation value determines the string coupling constant and organizes the string perturbation theory .",
    "together with the dual axion of an antisymmetric tensor field it forms a complex scalar @xmath30 of an abelian @xmath3 vector multiplet gauge bosons arises in the @xmath31 block of the conformal field theory . ] and in the standard heterotic normalization one defines @xmath32 such that large @xmath30 corresponds to weak coupling . with this convention the peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry associated with the axion is given by a shift @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a continuous parameter in string perturbation theory .",
    "however , once nonperturbative corrections are taken into account this continuous symmetry is broken down to a discrete subgroup and then @xmath34 must be an integer .",
    "the couplings of the vector multiplets ( the khler potential and the gauge couplings ) are entirely encoded in a holomorphic prepotential @xmath35 . due to the non - renormalization theorem of @xmath0 supersymmetry @xmath35",
    "does not receive quantum corrections beyond one - loop in perturbation theory but can ( and is ) corrected nonperturbatively . using the fact that the dilaton counts string loops , @xmath35 can be expanded for large @xmath30 ( weak coupling ) according to @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 is the tree level ( one - loop ) contribution while @xmath39 denotes nonperturbative corrections .",
    "the universal couplings of the dilaton and the continuous peccei  quinn symmetry of the axion completely determine @xmath37 for all heterotic string vacua to be @xcite ( using the conventions of @xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath30 and @xmath28 are the `` special '' @xmath0 coordinates .",
    "@xmath41 is necessarily @xmath30-independent .",
    "the tree level prepotential given in ( [ eq : fhettree ] ) corresponds to the khler potential @xmath42 which is the khler potential of the homogeneous space @xmath43 up to discrete identifications . note that ( [ eq : mhet ] ) is subject to string loop corrections and , in general , is not isomorphic to @xmath25 .",
    "so far we concentrated on the lowest order ( two derivative ) couplings in the effective action .",
    "there is a special class of higher derivative curvature couplings which arise from chiral integrals in @xmath0 superspace and therefore are also governed by holomorphic functions @xmath44 of the vector multiplets .",
    "these are couplings of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ( anti - self - dual ) riemann tensor , @xmath47 is the field strength of the graviphoton and the couplings @xmath48 obey @xcite always is a holomorphic quantity while @xmath48 is the non - harmonic coupling . ]",
    "@xmath49 at the string tree level @xmath50 holds and therefore @xmath51 is a harmonic function of the vector moduli . however , at one - loop @xmath51 develops a holomorphic anomaly @xmath52 . for @xmath53",
    "one finds @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the khler potential defined in ( [ eq : kahler ] ) ; @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) counts the number of hypermultiplets ( vector multiplets ) .",
    "similar to ( [ eq : fhet ] ) the holomorphic @xmath58 s can be expanded in the dilaton according to @xmath59 again @xmath60 is dilaton independent and the perturbative peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry of the axion determines @xmath61 where the normalization of @xmath62 is fixed by the normalization of ( [ eq : anomaly ] ) .",
    "type ii string vacua are built from conformal field theories of central charge @xmath63 .",
    "the four - dimensional space - time degrees of freedom arise from a @xmath64 block leaving @xmath65 as the internal conformal field theory .",
    "the standard way to obtain @xmath0 space - time supersymmetry is to demand a left - right symmetric @xmath0 world - sheet supersymmetry of the internal @xmath65 conformal field theory .",
    "an example of such a conformal field theory is provided by the on a calabi - yau manifold .",
    "let us consider a type iia superstring compactified on a  manifold @xmath6 .",
    "equivalently , we can compactify the type iib string on @xmath66 , the mirror of @xmath6 .    the number of vector- and hypermoduli is directly related to the hodge numbers of the calabi  yau compactification .",
    "specifically one finds @xmath67 for type iia and @xmath68 for type iib ; in both cases the additional hypermultiplet corresponds to the type ii dilaton .",
    "the gauge group @xmath69 always is a product of @xmath70 abelian @xmath3 factors and therefore one has in general @xmath71 where the `` @xmath72 '' counts the graviphoton .",
    "the dilaton always is the member of a hypermultiplet and thus ( [ eq : modulispace ] ) implies that for type ii vacua @xmath25 is independent on the dilaton and therefore determined at the string tree level exactly with no further corrections perturbatively or nonperturbatively .",
    "near the large radius limit of @xmath6 , the position in the moduli space @xmath25 is given by the complexified khler form on @xmath6  that is , an object of the form @xmath73 , where we expand @xmath74 so that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are real numbers and @xmath77 represents a basis of @xmath78 ( we assume that @xmath79 ) . as @xmath80 is dual to @xmath81 and @xmath81 is dual to @xmath82 , we have an isomorphism between @xmath80 and @xmath82 . using this isomorphism , we can associate a divisor , @xmath83 , of @xmath6 to each @xmath77 .    in the large radius limit ( or large complex structure limit for type iib )",
    "the holomorphic prepotential has the generic structure @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the moduli of the vector multiplets in @xmath0 special coordinates and we have omitted the  loop terms .",
    "recall @xcite that the instanton corrections in ( [ eq : ftt ] ) come from rational curves within @xmath6 .",
    "as these curves get larger , the instanton effects become smaller . in order for ( [ eq : ftt ] ) to make sense , we must assume that the sum produced by the instantons is convergent .",
    "if it is not , one can often replace the  model by another theory ( such as a landau - ginzburg theory ) in which some other instanton sum converges .",
    "this is regarded as the underlying @xmath0 superconformal field theory being in another `` phase '' @xcite .",
    "if we insist that we are in a  phase and thus that ( [ eq : ftt ] ) is a convergent series then we are demanding that all the rational curves on @xmath6 are sufficiently large .",
    "now we are interested in identifying those calabi ",
    "yau compactification which can serve as possible dual descriptions of heterotic vacua .",
    "the idea is , that once all nonperturbative effects have been taken into account , the heterotic theory and the type ii theory describe exactly the same physics in the infrared .",
    "one test of the proposed duality is to check that both theories have identical moduli spaces .",
    "however , in either case we only know the respective weak coupling limits . nevertheless due to the product structure of the moduli space and the fact that the dilaton resides in different super - multiplets in the two theories it is possible to compare the heterotic @xmath25 in a weak coupling expansion with the exact @xmath25 of the type ii vacuum .",
    "in particular , one of the vector moduli @xmath86 in the type iia vacuum must be the image of the axion - dilaton pair of the heterotic string .",
    "let us denote this particular member by @xmath87 and let @xmath88 be the associated divisor .",
    "is a `` @xmath89-cartier '' divisor .",
    "this follows since an irrational class would not be compatible with the peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry . ]",
    "as we have just said we can only compare the moduli spaces for large @xmath30 and hence @xmath90 also has to be large . in this limit",
    "the type iia @xmath91-field is a periodic variable and obeys @xmath92 .",
    "this is consistent with the peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry @xmath93 of the heterotic axion if we identify @xmath94 using the fact that both the complexified khler form and the axion - dilaton are special @xmath0 coordinates ( [ eq : ax - ii ] ) is exact up to symplectic @xmath95 reparametrizations and not only valid at the large radius limit .",
    "the other vector multiplets will be denoted by @xmath96 ( or equivalently @xmath97 ) , for @xmath98 .",
    "given our assumption that the weakly coupled phase of the heterotic string maps into the  phase of the type iia string we can obtain from ( [ eq : fhettree ] ) and ( [ eq : ftt ] ) that    @xmath99    @xmath100 must be an element of the second homology of @xmath6 . since ( [ eq : ssi ] ) tells us that this element has zero intersection with any 4-cycle , it must be trivial .",
    "that is , @xmath101 we know that @xmath88 itself is not trivial as the associated modulus is not trivial . in the language of algebraic geometry we have shown that the `` numerical @xmath102-dimension '' of the divisor @xmath88 is one .",
    "next , let us analyze the positivity properties of @xmath88 .",
    "we have asserted that we are in the  phase of the type iia string . from the work of @xcite",
    "it follows that we know something about @xmath103 .",
    "very roughly , it means that @xmath103 lies within the khler cone of @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the volume of any algebraic subspace within @xmath6 is measured by the khler form to be positive .",
    "suppose we take a theory which is in the  phase and modify the khler form as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a large real number .",
    "in the heterotic language , this amounts to increasing the value of the dilaton , i.e. , making the string more weakly coupled .",
    "thus , the instanton sums will become more convergent . if this is to have the same effect in the type iia string , then this change in the khler form must keep us inside the khler cone of @xmath6 .",
    "this amounts to the assertion that @xmath106 for any algebraic curve , @xmath107 , within @xmath6 . in the language of algebraic geometry , this tells us that @xmath88 is `` nef '' .",
    "lastly we need one more property of @xmath88 which follows from identifying the higher derivative curvature couplings @xmath58 in both theories .",
    "since the @xmath58 s depend only on the vector multiplets they are independent on the type ii dilaton and one finds that they arise solely at the @xmath108-loop order . in the large radius limit one obtains @xcite @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes the second chern class of @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath111 develops a holomorphic anomaly given by @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the ricci - tensor on the moduli space .",
    "let us first note that for @xmath114 the large @xmath30 limits of ( [ eq : fnhettree ] ) and ( [ eq : fgtt ] ) already agree with no further conditions imposed .",
    "however , identifying the @xmath115 s of the dual pairs results in a constraint on @xmath116 .",
    "note that the holomorphic anomaly of ( [ eq : anomalyii ] ) simplifies if , in the large @xmath103 limit , the type ii prepotential and khler potential are identical with the heterotic @xmath35 and @xmath55 of ( [ eq : fhettree ] ) and ( [ eq : kahler ] ) .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that ( [ eq : anomalyii ] ) reduces in this limit to @xmath117 where @xmath118 is defined in ( [ eq : anomaly ] ) .",
    "we see that the anomalies of a dual pair coincide up to the overall normalization . in turn",
    "this can be used to align the overall normalization between the @xmath115 s in each vacuum . identifying the @xmath115 s using ( [ eq : ax - ii ] ) , ( [ eq : fnhettree ] ) , ( [ eq : anomaly ] ) , ( [ eq : anomalyiib ] ) and ( [ eq : fgtt ] ) results in @xmath119    we may now use the results of oguiso @xcite which state",
    "that    let @xmath6 be a minimal  threefold .",
    "let @xmath102 be a nef divisor on @xmath6 .",
    "if the numerical @xmath102-dimension of @xmath102 equals one and @xmath120 then there is a fibration @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is @xmath5 and the generic fibre is a k3 surface .    we have obtained the desired result  @xmath6 has to be a k3-fibration in order to be the dual partner of a heterotic vacuum .",
    "note that in general the fibre is allowed to degenerate to something other than a k3 surface over a finite number of points on @xmath122 .",
    "this fibration is shown in figure [ fig : fib ] .",
    "we should emphasize two points about our derivation of the result .",
    "firstly , we assumed that the  manifold in the type iia theory was in the  phase when the heterotic string was weakly - coupled .",
    "it is certainly conceivable that there may be dual pairs where the phases are not aligned like this . in such an example , there is then no reason why a  manifold on the type iia side , which appears for some strongly - coupled regime of the heterotic moduli space , should be a k3-fibration . in other words ,",
    "the weakly - coupled heterotic string might be dual to a type iia string theory on a manifold @xmath6 , which is not a k3-fibration , in the following sense .",
    "the instanton sum in ( [ eq : ftt ] ) is necessarily divergent but could be reinterpreted in terms of some other non-  phase ( such as a perturbed landau - ginzburg theory or orbifold @xcite ) to give a convergent sum of corrections .",
    "secondly , we are stating only that the type iia string is compactified on a k3-fibration .",
    "the type iib string is compactified on @xmath66 , the mirror of @xmath6 , which may or may not be a k3-fibration .",
    "the question as to what extent mirror symmetry acts within the class of k3-fibrations has not been analyzed at this point in time so we can not make any strong statements about when @xmath66 is a k3-fibration .",
    "one can observe though that in the cases discussed in @xcite , where the mirror map is in the greene - plesser orbifold form @xcite , then the mirror orbifolding operation preserves the fibration structure and so both @xmath6 and @xmath66 are k3-fibrations .    note that ( [ eq : ctwo ] ) not only tells us that @xmath123 but that the value is the euler characteristic of a k3 surface .",
    "this tells us that the element in @xmath82 corresponding to @xmath88 is given precisely by a generic k3 fibre @xcite .",
    "clearly the 2-cycle dual to this is given by @xmath122 , the base space .",
    "it then follows that @xmath124 is the cohomology element that gives us the _ size _ of this 2-cycle .",
    "that is , the dilaton in the heterotic string is given by the size of the base @xmath5 in the fibration of @xmath6 .",
    "thus far we have made no appeal to string - string duality in six - dimensions but we can use this duality to reproduce the result we have just found concerning the dilaton . let us set the axion in the heterotic string to zero for simplicity . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the dilaton in six dimensions for the heterotic string and @xmath127 is its metric with the corresponding values primed for the type iia string .",
    "let us apply this to our picture in four dimensions by `` compactifying '' the six - dimensional space - time over @xmath5 .",
    "given the weyl - rescaling between the type iia and heterotic space - times , the areas of these rational curves will differ by a factor of @xmath126 .",
    "the action for the heterotic string can then be written @xmath128 this last form of the action tells us that the area of the base in the type iia picture gives the four - dimensional dilaton of the heterotic string as we saw above .",
    "for the dilaton modulus in the type iib picture we can use the monomial - divisor mirror of @xcite ( or , more specifically , the results of @xcite ) to find the corresponding deformation of complex structure of @xmath66 .",
    "note also that we know the result exactly  since the dilaton is given by the khler form , the map between the dilaton and the complex modulus of @xmath66 is corrected by solutions to the picard - fuchs equation .",
    "for example , in @xcite @xmath66 was taken to be an orbifold of the hypersurface @xmath129 in @xmath130 .",
    "it was then conjectured that there was a heterotic string dual to a type iib string compactified on @xmath66 . from what we have said above and using the results of @xcite",
    "it follows that the heterotic dilaton is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 this agrees with the conjectured relationship in @xcite .",
    "one can show that the example with @xmath133 of @xcite is also consistent with our statements .",
    "it is perhaps worth emphasizing that we have deduced ( [ eq : eg1 ] ) given only the existence of the weakly - coupled heterotic string  no further knowledge of the heterotic string ( such as enhanced gauge symmetries ) was required .",
    "let us now turn to the other @xmath134 vector moduli .",
    "now that we know that @xmath6 is a k3-fibration , we can say exactly where the other contributions to @xmath135 come from .",
    "the general statement is that they can be divided into two classes  those from the generic fibre and those from the singular fibre .",
    "let us concentrate first on the contribution from the generic fibre .",
    "let @xmath136 be an algebraic curve in a generic k3 fibre .",
    "as we move about the base space we can map the curve into equivalent curves in the other generic fibres .",
    "adding all these curves together gives us a divisor , @xmath97 in @xmath6 .",
    "that is , we have written @xmath97 as a fibration over @xmath122 where @xmath136 is the generic fibre .",
    "( note that @xmath97 is not dual to @xmath136 . )",
    "thus , a curve in the generic fibre contributes to @xmath137 . because a generic k3-fibration has monodromy , we may have two curves in a generic fibre that can be mapped into each other by cycling round a path on @xmath122 .",
    "clearly such a pair only contribute one to @xmath137 as they both were required in building @xmath97 .",
    "let us denote a generic fibre @xmath138 , where @xmath139 .",
    "the set of ( duals of ) algebraic curves in @xmath138 generate a sublattice of @xmath140 called the `` picard lattice '' of @xmath138 .",
    "clearly both @xmath141 and the lattice @xmath140 can be embedded in @xmath142 .",
    "the picard lattice can be considered the intersection @xmath143 .",
    "consider the space @xmath144 .",
    "the natural wedge product between elements in this space endows it with a metric .",
    "one can show that this metric has signature ( 3,19 ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath145 be a @xmath146-form on @xmath138 .",
    "one can show that the real and imaginary parts of @xmath145 span a space - like 2-plane in @xmath147 . as any element of the picard lattice is",
    "a ( 1,1)-form and so lies orthogonal to this 2-plane , the picard lattice must be embeddable in @xmath148 .",
    "the `` picard number '' of a k3 surface is the rank of the picard lattice .",
    "clearly then , the picard number can be no bigger than 20 .",
    "the khler form on a k3 surface is a vector within the real space generated by the picard lattice .",
    "the volume of the k3 surface is given by the length of this vector which must therefore be positive .",
    "thus we have shown that the picard lattice must have signature @xmath149 . from what we have said above ,",
    "the vector multiplets coming from the generic fibre are the generators of the monodromy - invariant subspace of the picard lattice .",
    "this subspace must contain the khler form of the fibre and so also has signature @xmath149 .",
    "the rank is clearly less than or equal to the picard number .",
    "consider the intersection numbers @xmath150 where the latter two divisors come from curves in the generic fibres .",
    "this is equal to the intersection @xmath151 within the fibre and is thus given by the intersection form of the monodromy - invariant picard lattice .",
    "this means that we have exactly reproduced the heterotic string result ( [ eq : fhettree ] ) in terms of the type iia string .",
    "we also know that there is at least one ( the volume of the fibre ) but no more than 20 moduli from this source .",
    "adding these to the dilaton and the @xmath3 from the gravity multiplet shows that the rank of the gauge group for k3-fibrations with only contributions to @xmath137 from the base space and generic fibers satisfies @xmath152 which is consistent with the heterotic bound ( [ eq : hetrank ] ) .",
    "the upper limits are suspiciously close to each other and we can probably bring these results into agreement once we take into account the _ quantum _ geometry of the k3 fibre . in the above analysis we used purely classical geometry for the analysis of the picard lattice . given the appearance of quantum effects in k3 surfaces @xcite it is not at all unreasonable to expect that some quantum picard lattice exists for a planck - sized k3 surface with picard number 22 .",
    "this would bring the upper limit of @xmath69 into complete agreement with the heterotic limit",
    ". the lower limit of the heterotic vacuum can never be reached for a calabi ",
    "yau manifold since there necessarily has to be a volume form @xmath103 which obeys @xmath153 and thus can not be the image of the heterotic dilaton .",
    "however it is conceivable that a model which does not have a phase may be used to achieve this lower limit .",
    "so far we have discussed the successes of the type iia / heterotic duality picture .",
    "now let us discuss some of the short - comings and the reasons why they must appear .",
    "the first question which comes to mind concerns the contributions to @xmath135 from the degenerate fibres .",
    "let us call such a divisor @xmath154 . clearly such a divisor will not intersect the generic fibre @xmath88 and so @xmath155 in contradiction with ( [ eq : fhettree ] ) for the heterotic string .",
    "this implies that @xmath156-fibrations where @xmath135 contains moduli corresponding to degenerate fibers can not be the dual of a standard weakly coupled heterotic string vacuum as we described it in section  2 .",
    "however , such fibrations still have a candidate for the image of the heterotic dilaton but there seem to be no heterotic states which @xmath154 can be the image of .",
    "if there are such states ( [ eq : decoup ] ) implies that they decouple at the tree level and only arise at one - loop and/or nonperturbatively ( equivalently this says that they can not be states in the conformal field theory ) . since in general @xmath157 the corresponding heterotic states would have to arise already at the one - loop level .",
    "alternatively they could be states that become massless only nonperturbatively but with `` unusual '' couplings to the dilaton such as the ramond - ramond states in type ii strings .",
    "being members of vector multiplets they would enhance the rank of @xmath17 nonperturbatively but so far no such states have been identified directly in the heterotic string",
    ".    the number of states coming from singular fibres can be very large easily taking the rank of the gauge group beyond the expected limit of 24 .",
    "but as we have just argued these vector multiplets have no conformal field theory interpretations on the heterotic side and thus no contradiction arises .",
    "conversely , demanding the absence of states corresponding to degenerate fibers implies the bound ( [ eq : iirank ] ) perfectly consistent with the heterotic string .",
    "what if @xmath6 is not a k3-fibration ? what happens to the heterotic dual ?",
    "this question is remarkably similar to the question of if a manifold has a mirror partner .",
    "a simple example of a manifold without a mirror partner is that of one with no deformations .",
    "this implies @xmath158 and so the mirror would have @xmath159 which is impossible for a khler manifold .",
    "it turns out however that even in many cases where @xmath160 , the manifold may have no mirror .",
    "this was analyzed in @xcite where it was shown that some @xmath0 superconformal field theories , appearing as the mirror of a  theory , have a non - trivial moduli space of ( 1,1)-forms but nowhere in this moduli space is there a  phase .",
    "we claim that the same thing happens for type ii / heterotic duality .",
    "the moduli space of vector multiplets in a type iia string may be non - trivial but it may be that there is simply no place in this moduli space where there is a weakly - coupled heterotic string .",
    "this should happen if @xmath6 is not a k3-fibration .",
    "of course , this works both ways .",
    "given the moduli space of vector multiplets of a heterotic string there may be no place in this space where a weakly - coupled type iia string compactified on a  manifold can be described .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that missing dual partners can enter into the picture of connecting up the moduli space of @xmath0 theories via phase transitions as in @xcite and flops as in @xcite .",
    "it may be that there is an extremal transition ( such as a conifold transition ) or flop on the type iia side from a manifold which is a k3-fibration to a manifold which is not . in this case",
    ", the extremal transition or flop involves shrinking down the base @xmath5 of the fibration .",
    "this means that on the heterotic side the phase transition occurs at strong coupling and the `` new '' phase no longer has a ( heterotic ) weak coupling limit .",
    "we thank m.  gross for many important contributions .",
    "it is also a pleasure to thank p.  argyres , p.  berglund , s.  chaudhuri , b.  de wit , b.  greene , j.  harvey , v.  kaplunovsky , d.  morrison , j.  polchinski , r.  schimmrigk and a.  strominger for useful conversations as well as all the other `` plancksters '' at the i.t.p .",
