    "has been to sample the triangular phase space and determine whether the most favorable structures are thermodynamically stable @xcite .    of these ternary oxides , the zinc oxide spinels ( ab@xmath0o@xmath1 , where a = zn ) are particularly attractive due to their low cost and unique doping characteristics @xcite . specifically for p - type znco@xmath0o@xmath1 and nico@xmath0o@xmath1 , high conductivities in these materials",
    "are attributed to off - stoichiometric compositions , especially when synthesized in zn / ni rich environments .",
    "it has been shown that nico@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits high conductivities , on the order of @xmath5 , in part due to self - doping through the preference of the ni atom for the t@xmath6 ( tetrahedrally coordinated ) site over the o@xmath7 ( octahedrally coordinated ) site in the normal spinel structure . according to multiple theoretical investigations ,",

    "the anti - site defects create donor and acceptor states , and thus are favorable for improving the electrical conductivity of the material @xcite .",

    "we notice a significant narrowing of the band gap .",
    "additionally , we note that with increasing atomic number of b , there is less contribution from the b 3d orbitals to the shallow valence band states , resulting in less stabilization of the o 2p orbitals , and a broader hybridization range throughout the shallow valence states .",

    "first , we analyze the difference in calculated properties between the dft and hse computational approaches .",
    "when the band gap is merely underpredicted with dft ( e.g. , the znco@xmath0o@xmath1 system ) , we rectify this underprediction by applying the scissor operator in the middle of the band gap to obtain the same band gap as that determined by the hse functional .",
    "furthermore , we also compute @xmath15 for both the hse and the dft results with the reported band gap of 2.8 ev @xcite to determine whether the underestimation or overestimation of this gap affects our results .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath36 , and the power factor , @xmath46 , are shown in figure [ compare_co_gap ] for the four scenarios of adjusted band gap : hse unadjusted ( hse ) , dft adjusted to match hse ( dft - hse ) , dft adjusted to match experiment ( dft - exp ) , and hse adjusted to match experiment ( hse - exp ) . from these results",
    "we determine that : 1 . artificially changing the band gap does not discernibly affect the magnitude and distribution of the @xmath15 values at 300 k , 2 .",
    "the curvature of the bands from the dft calculation describes the valence states much differently from the those obtained using the hse calculation , due to the incorrect exchange interaction factor , and 3 .",
    "when the hse calculation is corrected by manually narrowing the band gap to fit previously reported values , the conductivity values are not affected by the band gap difference .",
    "these results indicate that the distribution of states in the summation for property calculation is not dependent on the width of the band gap , as long as the conduction bands lie outside the fermi distribution ( this observation is corroborated by the previously presented band structures ) .",
    "the last result also means that we may calculate the electronic properties of these p - type alloys at 300 k using the hse determined band gap , without adjustment for experiment , as long as our band gap is not over or underpredicted by an amount that would place the bottom conduction band within the fermi distribution range filter at 300k .",
    "since the computed band gap deviates from the experimentally observed gap by 0.9 ev , we originally expected that the computed band curvature will not be exact .",
    "however , the hse band curvatures are more accurate than the dft values , as the dft band gap is underpredicted by a much larger amount ( 1.9 ev ) , and underprediction leads to greater deviation of band curvature due to exchange interaction .",

    "the undoped conductivity of the material at 300 k is predicted to be @xmath58 and the first local minimum is of the same magnitude and occurs at approximately the same doping level ( i.e. , -0.73 ev for cu vs. -0.65 ev for co ) as the znco@xmath0o@xmath1 compound .",
