    "ergodicity is a generic property in the space of probability measures invariant by a topologically mixing anosov flow on a compact manifold .",

    "the proof of k. sigmund s result is based on the specification property .",
    "this property relies on the uniform hyperbolicity of the system and on the compactness of the ambient space .    in @xcite",
    ", we showed that ergodicity is a generic property of hyperbolic systems without relying on the specification property . as a result",
    ", we were able to prove that the set of ergodic probability measures invariant by the geodesic flow , on a negatively curved manifold , is a dense @xmath0 set , without any compactness assumptions or pinching assumptions on the sectional curvature of the manifold .",
    "a corollary of our result is the existence of ergodic invariant probability measures of full support for the geodesic flow on any complete negatively curved manifold , as soon as the flow is transitive .",
    "surprisingly , we succeeded in extending this corollary to the nonpositively curved setting .",
    "however , the question of genericity in nonpositive curvature appears to be much more difficult , even for surfaces . in @xcite , we gave examples of compact nonpositively curved surfaces with negative euler characteristic for which ergodicity is not a generic property in the space of probability measures invariant by the geodesic flow .",
    "the first goal of the article is to obtain genericity results in the non positively curved setting . from now on , all manifolds are assumed to be _ connected , complete _ riemannian manifolds .",
    "recall that a _",
    "flat strip _ in the universal cover of the manifold is a totally geodesic subspace isometric to the space @xmath1\\times { \\bf r}$ ] , for some @xmath2 , endowed with its standard euclidean structure .",
    "we first show that if there are no flat strip , genericity holds .",
    "let @xmath3 be a nonpositively curved manifold , such that its universal cover has no flat strips .",
    "assume that the geodesic flow has at least three periodic orbit on the unit tangent bundle @xmath4 of @xmath3 .",
    "then the set of ergodic probability measures on @xmath4 is a dense @xmath0-subset of the set of all probability measures invariant by the flow .",

    "the assumption that @xmath7 is open in @xmath8 is satisfied in many examples .",
    "for instance , it is true as soon as the number of flat strips on the manifold is finite .",
    "the set of periodic orbits of the geodesic flow is in @xmath9-correspondence with the set of oriented closed geodesics on the manifold .",
    "thus , the assumption that @xmath10 contains at least three different periodic orbits means that there are at least two distinct nonoriented closed geodesics in the manifold that do not lie in the projection of a flat strip .",
    "this assumption rules out a few uninteresting examples , such as simply connected manifolds or cylinders , and corresponds to the classical assumption of nonelementaricity in negative curvature .    whether ergodicity is a generic property in the space of all invariant measures , in presence of flat strips of intermediate dimension , is still an open question .",
    "in section [ examples ] , we will see examples with periodic flat strips of maximal dimension where ergodicity is not generic .",
    "the last part of the article is devoted to mixing and entropy .",
    "inspired by results of @xcite , we study the genericity of other dynamical properties of measures , as zero entropy or mixing . in particular , we prove that    [ zero - entropy - and - mixing ] let @xmath3 be a connected , complete , nonpositively curved manifold , such that @xmath7 contains at least three different periodic orbits of the geodesic flow and is open in the nonwandering set @xmath8 .",
    "the set of invariant probability measures with zero entropy for the geodesic flow is generic in the set of invariant probability measures on @xmath7 .",

    "we have the inclusions @xmath49 and they can be strict , except if @xmath3 has negative curvature , in which case they all coincide .",

    ".    it would be interesting to understand when we have the equality @xmath50 .",
    "we will show that on compact rank one surfaces , if there is a flat strip , then there exists also a periodic flat strip . when the surface is a flat torus , we have of course @xmath51",
    ".    it could also happen on some noncompact rank one manifolds that all vectors that bound a nonperiodic flat strip are wandering , so that @xmath50 .",

    "nonelementary_. this means that there exists at least two ( and therefore infinitely many ) closed geodesics on @xmath3 , and therefore at least four ( and in fact infinitely many ) periodic orbits of the geodesic flow on @xmath4 ( each closed geodesic lifts to @xmath4 into two periodic curves , one for each orientation ) .",
    "this allows to discard simply connected manifolds or hyperbolic cylinders , for which there is no interesting recurring dynamics .    in the nonpositively curved case , we must also get rid of flat euclidean cylinders , for which there are infinitely many periodic orbits , but no other recurrent trajectories .",

    "this result was improved by sigmund @xcite who showed that there is a dense subset of bernoulli measures . of course , these results imply in particular that the above @xmath0-set is a dense @xmath0-subset of @xmath411 . but",
    "the methods of @xcite and @xcite strongly use specific properties of a shift dynamics , and seem therefore difficult to generalize . in any case , such a result would impose to add the assumption that the flow is topologically mixing .          let @xmath414 be some countable algebra of lipschitz bounded functions on @xmath415 separating points . such a family is dense in the set of all bounded borel functions , with respect to the @xmath416 norm , for all borel probability measures @xmath417 on @xmath415 ( see @xcite for a short proof ) .",
    "now , the complement of the set of weakly mixing measures @xmath418 can be written as the union of the following sets : @xmath419 , \\,s.t.\\\\ \\mu\\times\\mu=\\alpha m_1+(1-\\alpha)m_2,\\mbox { and } \\int f_i dm_1\\ge\\int f_i dm_2+\\frac{1}{l}\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we check as in @xcite that these sets are closed , so that the weakly mixing measures of @xmath15 form a @xmath0-subset of @xmath326 .                p. billingsley .",
