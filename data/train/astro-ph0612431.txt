    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are systems where a compact object , either a neutron star or black hole , accretes material via roche - lobe overflow from a low mass ( @xmath61@xmath5 ) companion",
    ". soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are an important sub - class of the lmxbs .",
    "contrary to the persistent lmxbs , that always accrete material at high rates , they occasionally have short outbursts ( @xmath7weeks up to months ) before returning back to quiescence .",
    "these systems are especially interesting for the prospect of quiescent studies of the mass donor , since they provide the only direct method to obtain orbital solutions and system masses for lmxbs ( e.g. charles & coe 2005 ) .",
    "such system parameter studies are usually not possible during an outburst because the photospheric emission from the companion star is swamped by the emission from the x - ray irradiated disk .",
    "unfortunately , in quiescence many sxt companion stars are too faint ( @xmath8@xmath922 - 23 ) to allow kinematic studies .",
    "this has substantially hampered detailed interpretation of their evolution , and our ability to construct compact object mass distributions .",
    "aqlx-1 is a sxt that shows one of the shortest recurrence times , making it one of the most intensively studied systems .",
    "aqlx-1 shows quasi - periodic outbursts , with approximately one year intervals ( priedhorsky & terrell 1984 ) . during such an outburst it shows typei x - ray bursts , indicating that the compact object is a neutron star ( koyama et  al .",

    "an 18.97 hr periodic modulation in the optical was observed during an outburst , which was interpreted as the orbital period ( chevalier & ilovaisky 1991 ) . in quiescence",

    "1999 ) , severely hampering kinematic studies of aqlx-1 . despite intense studies there are currently no strong constraints on the system parameters .",

    "2000 ; chevalier & ilovaisky 1991,1998 ; shahbaz et  al .",
    "this is interpreted as ellipsoidal variations from the roche - lobe filling donor star in quiescence , changing in outburst to reflection due to heating of the side of the secondary facing the neutron star .",
    "this suggests that during an outburst the optical light is dominated by the irradiated side of the secondary ( welsh et  al .",
    "2000 ) . the spectrum of aqlx-1 in quiescence , after careful deconvolution of the spectrum of the contamination star , shows absorption features that can be associated with a k6-m0 v star , as well as emission lines typical for lmxbs ( chevalier et  al .",

    "narrow emission line components coming from the irradiated companion star , especially in the bowen blend ( a blend of niii 4634/4640   and ciii 4647/4650 lines ) , were used to trace its orbital motion and determine the mass function . since then",

    "most importantly , the narrow lines in the june data do not show any orbital motion , despite phase coverage of @xmath70.1@xmath17 near the orbital conjunction .",
    "a close inspection of the individual may 2004 spectra shows that these weak and narrow stationary lines are also present but swamped by the much stronger disk and moving components .",
    "although these narrow lines are obscured most of the time by the moving lines , the data is consistent with them being present in all spectra .",
    "unfortunately , since we do not have an absolute flux calibration for the spectra , it is not clear if the line flux from these stationary components has evolved between may and june 2004 .",
    "taking a closer look at the region around the bowen @xmath15@xmath154630 - 4650 emission in the individual spectra ( see fig.[bowen ] ) , we notice that it is dominated by narrow emission lines from niii @xmath154640/4634 . curiously , there is no indication of the presence of narrow ciii lines , as was the case in e.g. scox-1 ( steeghs & casares 2002 ) , but we do note that also in other lmxbs the niii bowen lines are stronger than the ciii lines ( e.g. casares et  al .",
    "fig.[trail ] shows that these niii lines are moving , and we interpret this as orbital motion of a confined region in the system .",
    "furthermore , a close inspection of heii @xmath154686 shows that there is a strong narrow component ( making up @xmath730% of the total line flux ) that appears to be moving in phase with the narrow bowen lines ( see fig.[trail ] ) .",
    "given that the off - set between the narrow heii and bowen lines does not change between the spectra strengthens our identification of the narrow bowen lines as niii .    in order to estimate the orbital phases of our spectra we started with the orbital period derived by chevalier et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and phase zero by welsh et  al .",
    "phase zero is defined as the minimum in the photometric lightcurve , which is expected to correspond to inferior conjunction of the secondary if the photometric lightcurve is indeed dominated by its emission .",
    "unfortunately , this phasing does not match up with the published phase zero by chevalier et  al .",
    "the differences between these zero points is 0.1 orbital phase , while the error suggests only a difference of 0.04 orbital phase .",
    "since we can not be certain what causes this discrepancy , we used a weighted average of both ephemerides ( assuming all quoted errors are correct ) to derive the orbital phase for our spectra .",
    "we show the results in table[log ] . in order to estimate the phase uncertainty",
    ", we use a combination of the weighted formal error of two ephemerides ( 0.05 orbital phase ) plus a systematic error of 0.09 orbital phase derived from the difference between the formal and observed error between the 2 ephemerides .",

    "fitting a sine curve to the measurements , with the orbital period taken as fixed , it is clear that the 18 june lines do not originate from the same source in the binary frame , and we therefore do not include them in our radial velocity fits . from a fit through the resulting points we derived a velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath22=247@xmath28 km s@xmath3 ,",

    "note that phase zero was a free parameter , and does not include any systematic uncertainty in the ephemeris used which is expected to be of order @xmath70.1 .",
    "we do notice a small jump in the radial velocities around orbital phase 0.33 , due to the narrow stationary lines that are starting to blend with the wing of the moving components , but excluding these points did not change the results of our fit .",

    "we have tried to subtract this narrow component , but were not able to do this reliably and could therefore not measure the radial velocities for the broad component from this line .",
    "instead , we investigated the other prominent emission lines and noted that the only line where a narrow component is not the dominating feature was h@xmath16 .",
    "however , also for this line we have to be cautious since there is some contamination from heii @xmath26 as shown in fig.[rest ] .",
    "we applied the double gaussian technique to the wings of this line ( schneider & young 1980 ) . as we moved away from the line core",
    ", we noted that the velocity semi - amplitude was stable at @xmath27=68@xmath25 km s@xmath3 , the zero - phase was at @xmath24=0.35@xmath20.05 and the mean velocity around @xmath23=130@xmath220 km s@xmath3 ( while keeping the orbital period fixed again ) .",
    "these values appear to be consistent with those from the broad component in heii @xmath154686 , and indeed show a 0.5 phase difference between the broad and narrow components .",
    "however , we do note that the difference in mean velocity between the narrow and broad lines is consistent with the difference between h@xmath16 and heii @xmath154859 , suggesting that the latter is contributing significantly to the blend .",
    "furthermore , we also note that formally the fit is not acceptable ( @xmath21=458 for 36 d.o.f . ) , showing that we must treat this result with caution .",
    "we have detected narrow niii fluorescence lines in the optical spectrum of aqlx-1 during outburst that are very similar to the donor star fluorescence features observed in other systems .",
    "having derived the radial velocity curve for these features , we will now discuss the likelihood of these tracing the irradiated donor in aqlx-1 .",
    "these lines are a dominant feature of the bowen blend , as was also the case in gx339@xmath124 , scox-1 , x1822@xmath12371 , v801ara and v926sco ( hynes et  al .",

    "2003 + 2006 ) . in these x - ray binaries the narrow lines",
    "are thought to originate on the surface of the companion star .",
    "this is nicely illustrated in the eclipsing lmxb x1822 - 371 .",
    "here , the origin of the narrow bowen lines can unambiguously be claimed due to the excellent agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic ephemerides ( casares et  al .",
    "for the non - eclipsing lmxbs one has to rely on ephemerides based on determining the minima from lightcurves that are quite variable and far from sinusoidal .",
    "again , when the number of cycles is large enough one also finds an excellent agreement with the spectroscopic ephemerides , as was the case for v801ara , and also explained the apparent difference between the photometric and spectroscopic phasing in v926sco ( casares et  al .",
    "we therefore think that the most likely place of origin of the narrow lines observed in aqlx-1 is also on the surface of the companion star .",
    "unfortunately , due to the rather large uncertainty in the phasing ( 0.1 orbital phase ) , we can not rule out the possibility that the narrow lines in aqlx-1 do not originate on the companion star .",
    "however , for the other two potential regions where these lines could originate , the accretion stream or impact point , it is not clear if it could produce such narrow emission lines as observed in aqlx-1 . comparing the doppler maps of several lmxbs for which a signature of these regions is observed , namely exo0748@xmath12678 , x1822@xmath12371 and xtej1118@xmath28480",
    ", shows that the stream is observed either in absorption or the region is too extended to produce such narrow lines ( pearson et  al .",
    "2006 , casares et  al .",
    "2003 , torres et  al .",
    "furthermore , also in cataclysmic variables the accretion stream or impact point are commonly observed , but again they are very broad and do not tend to have sinusoidal radial velocity curves .",
    "we therefore think that the surface of the companion star is the most likely place of origin for these niii narrow lines , although an up - dated ephemeris and a doppler map of the bowen region are needed to confirm this .",
    "narrow bowen components have now been observed in growing list of x - ray binaries ( e.g. steeghs & casares 2002 , casares et  al .",
    "2003 , casares et  al .",
    "2006 ) , and we can now also add aqlx-1 to that list .",
    "interestingly , the narrow lines in aqlx-1 show a strong similarity with those observed in gx339@xmath124 , also an x - ray transient but with a black hole primary that was confirmed by the observation of the narrow bowen components ( hynes et  al .",
    "2003a ) . in gx339@xmath124",
    "the narrow components were of a comparable strength to those in aqlx-1 and also dominate the bowen region , while there was also an indication that a narrow component was contaminating the heii emission ( hynes et  al .",
    "2003a ) .    from the bowen / heii radial velocity curve we have estimated a systemic velocity of 30@xmath210 km s@xmath3 , while h@xmath16 gives a value of 130@xmath220 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this is most likely due to the presence of heii @xmath154859 , and would suggest that it is dominating the blend .",
    "such contamination has been observed in other x - ray binaries such as xtej2123@xmath12058 ( hynes et  al .",
    "however , this does mean that we will have to be very careful with associating this semi - amplitude with the orbital motion of the neutron star , since this could also be distorted due to the blending of different components .",
    "such caution is further enhanced by the fact that observations of , for example , x1822@xmath12371 by cowley et  al . (",
    "2003 ) have shown that measuring the semi - amplitude of the compact object from emission lines can only give a first order approximation .",
    "a full orbital phase coverage of a non - blended line that will not have a strong narrow component during a future outburst of aqlx-1 will be needed to estimate the @xmath29-velocity of the neutron star .",
    "the most curious feature of aqlx-1 is the change of the emission lines during the june 2004 observations .",
    "such a dramatic change in the morphology of the emission lines has been observed before in the x - ray nova groj0422@xmath2832 ( shrader et  al .",
    "when the source hardened in x - rays the heii @xmath154686 and the bowen lines were suddenly greatly reduced in intensity while h@xmath30 and h@xmath16 became much stronger .",
    "this change was interpreted as the `` turning on '' of the hard x - ray component .",
    "although , no hard x - ray / soft gamma ray observations were performed for aqlx-1 around the time of our observations in order to test this ( bird , private comm . ) , the soft x - ray lightcurve ( fig.[asm ] ) does indicate a large change in the accretion activity between the may and june observations .",
    "even if such `` turning on '' of the hard x - ray component occurred in aqlx-1 it is still strange that we do not observe the donor star anymore in the june 2004 observations . since these observations were performed during the final stages of the outburst , i.e. a few days before it went back into quiescence ( maitra & bailyn 2005 )",
    ", a large fraction of the inner accretion disk might already have disappeared .",
    "this could have stopped the production of uv photons that are needed in the bowen fluorescence process ( mcclintock et  al .",
    "1975 ) , and thereby terminating the narrow lines coming from the companion .",
    "unfortunately , this scenario can not be verified with the limited spectral information that is contained in the asm data .",
    "another suggestion could be that the opening angle of the accretion disk has increased between the different observations , and is screening the donor star at the end of the outburst ( see also sect.4.2 ) .",
    "the other curious feature of aqlx-1 is the narrow , stationary lines that are present in both the may and june observations .",
    "these narrow lines do not show any change in radial velocity between the observed spectra , and have a mean velocity of more or less 30 km s@xmath3 , which is interestingly comparable to the systemic velocity derived from the lines that arise on the donor star .",
    "aqlx-1 is not the first source where such low velocity emission lines are observed .",
    "for example , in the dwarf novae ip peg , ss cyg and u gem among others ( see unda - sanzana et  al .",
    "2006 for an overview ) also show such low velocity emission lines ( steeghs et  al .",
    "1996 , unda - sunzana et  al . 2006 ) .",
    "also in the lmxb serx-1 such unusually narrow and stationary lines were present ( hynes et  al .",
    "this makes aqlx-1 another lmxb to become a member of the group that shows these low velocity emission lines , and clearly indicates that these lines are a long - lived and common feature that are independent of the spectral state of the source .",
    "currently there is no satisfactory explanation for these low velocity emission lines , but it is becoming apparent that these lines are present in many compact binaries .",
    "therefore , a convincing explanation should be sought .",
    "however , it is clear from aqlx-1 that they are not connected to the companion , contrary to the narrow and moving lines observed in the may 2004 spectra .      if we assume that we have detected a signature of the companion star , what can we say , in combination with previous observations , about the components of aqlx-1 ?",
    "we know that the compact object is a neutron star due to the presence of typei x - ray bursts ( koyama et  al .",
    "1981 ) , leading to a mass of the compact object @xmath143.1@xmath5 . based on photometry and spectroscopy of the optical counterpart of aqlx-1 ( correcting for the interloper star at a distance of 0.46 arcsec ) chevalier et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) determined the spectral type of the secondary as k6-m0 .",

    "( 2000 ) used the de - blended optical data to determine that the inclination is @xmath936@xmath31 , while the absence of dips or eclipses gives an upper - limit on the inclination of @xmath1470 - 80@xmath31 ( paczynski 1971 ) .    from fig.[comp ] we have determined a @xmath22 velocity of 247@xmath28 km s@xmath3 .",
    "however , since the narrow lines are expected to arise on the surface of the donor star , this value will be a lower - limit on the centre of mass velocity of the secondary . without using any other constraint on aqlx-1",

    "we found that a rotational broadening of 96@xmath215 km s@xmath3 is required .",
    "we have to be very careful with our estimate for the rotational broadening .",
    "first of all , we assumed that all the emission of the narrow component is coming from the companion .",
    "however , we do note a variation in line strength ( see fig.[trail ] ) and there might also be other broadening mechanisms , as was most likely the case in gx339@xmath124 ( hynes et  al .",
    "2003a ) . in this source",
    "the widths of emission lines were too high ( 270 - 350 km s@xmath3 ) to be due to rotational broadening only , and we can not exclude that some other broadening mechanisms are also present in aqlx-1 .",
    "furthermore , we also should take into account the effect of smearing due to the orbital motion on the emission lines .",
    "we estimated that it should be at maximum @xmath720 km s@xmath3 for aqlx-1 , and therefore smeared our arc - line by this amount .",
    "we noticed that this changed our estimates on the rotational broadening by @xmath60.6 km s@xmath3 , small enough to be discarded .",
    "finally , since the rotational broadening is close to the spectral resolution ( 70 km s@xmath3 ) , the optimal @xmath39@xmath34@xmath35 found could be very sensitive to the assumed template .",
    "we therefore also used the [ oi ] @xmath15557.4 sky - line of all the individual spectra to determine the rotational broadening in this way .",
    "we notice that the variation in seeing has a small effect on the estimate for the broadening , but it was always @xmath62 km s@xmath3 .",
    "although the difference between the sky - line and arc - line is negligible , high resolution spectra of a @xmath7full orbit will be needed to unambiguously determine the rotational broadening .",
    "bearing in mind these caveats , let us investigate the implications of our @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35 estimates on the neutron star mass .",
    "combining @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35 of 96@xmath215 km s@xmath3 with the so - called @xmath29-correction ( that allows us to estimate the centre of mass velocity of the secondary using @xmath22 ) we can determine both @xmath36 and @xmath0 ( muoz - darias et  al .",
    "however , we do note that this @xmath29-correction is ( weakly ) dependent on the inclination of the system , but strongly dependent on the opening angle of the accretion disk , both of which are unknown .",
    "we used the fourth order polynomial fits given by muoz - darias ( 2005 ) to determine the @xmath29-correction ( and also the corrected mass ratio @xmath36 ) that gives the lowest estimate for the neutron star mass .",
    "we did notice that this is a monotonically decreasing function with opening angle , i.e. the largest opening angle gives the smallest @xmath29-correction and therefore the smallest neutron star mass .",
    "on the other hand , the largest disk opening angle does give the largest mass ratio @xmath36 .",
    "assuming that @xmath0=247@xmath28 km s@xmath3 , we estimate that @xmath36@xmath140.58 at 95% confidence ( a disk opening angle of @xmath718@xmath31 ) corresponding to @xmath40@xmath41@xmath35@xmath12.2@xmath20.3@xmath5 , larger than the canonical neutron star mass . however ,",
    "we do stress again that high - resolution spectra are needed to verify this result , but also note that thus far we have assumed no @xmath29-correction ( and thus underestimated @xmath0 ) or taken into account the inclination , both of which will only increase the mass of the neutron star .",
    "let us in addition speculate that the velocity derived from fig.[neutron ] ( 68@xmath25 km s@xmath3 ) gives a first order estimate for the orbital motion of the neutron star",
    ". in this case ( @xmath36=0.28 ) is close to that determined above ( if @xmath22 is close to the centre of mass velocity @xmath0 ) , and leads to a ( maximum ) disk opening angle of @xmath30@xmath716@xmath31 . since aqlx-1 does not show eclipses , we can follow paczynski ( 1974 , 1983 ) to estimate an upper - limit on the inclination using @xmath42@xmath35=0.46(1+@xmath36)@xmath43 .",
    "this leads to @xmath35@xmath1465@xmath31 and together with @xmath36=0.28 gives an estimate on the neutron star mass of @xmath40@xmath92.7m@xmath44 , suggesting a rather massive neutron star .",
    "unfortunately , since we can not trust the derived radial velocity of the primary we can not unambiguously conclude this , but if the @xmath27 velocity could be confirmed and the inclination of the system constrained , it would then place strong limits on the equation of state of neutron star material ( e.g. lattimer & prakash 2001 ) .    while estimating the @xmath29-correction for the different disk opening angles , we did notice that an angle of @xmath714 - 15@xmath31 gives a minimum mass for the neutron star @xmath93.1@xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that already for opening angles slightly smaller than the maximum opening angle derived above , the compact object in aqlx-1 will exceed the maximum mass for a neutron star . since we know that the compact object is a neutron star",
    ", this could mean that the opening angle during the may observations is close to the allowed maximum .",
    "if the opening angle of the accretion disk was slightly larger during the time of our june observations ( either due to an asymmetry in the accretion disk or a real increase ) , this would completely screen the donor star and no narrow components would be observed anymore , explaining their absence during the observations at the end of the outburst .",
    "we conclude that we have detected narrow emission lines in the bowen region and heii @xmath154686 during an outburst of aqlx-1 , that we interpret as coming from irradiated side of the donor star .",
    "if correct , this allows us to constrain its orbital velocity for the first time .",
    "this leads to a hard mass function for the neutron star of @xmath4=1.23@xmath20.12@xmath5 , and for an inclination @xmath673@xmath31 exceeds the mass of a canonical 1.4@xmath5 neutron star .",
    "if we can trust the rotational broadening that we determined , the width of the emission lines places a lower limit on the mass of the primary of @xmath11.6@xmath5 ( at 95% confidence ) .",
    "this suggests that aqlx-1 harbours a more massive neutron star , warranting future observations exploiting the bowen fluorescence lines in order to improve the constraints on its binary parameters .",
    "better phase - coverage of the entire outburst with high - resolution spectra together with an updated ephemeris would not only constrain the orbital velocity of the compact object , but also help in understanding how the structure of the accretion disk evolves , and further our understanding of the nature of the low - velocity lines . given the difficulty of observing aqlx-1 in quiescence",
    ", this paper shows that high resolution optical spectroscopy could be a promising way forward .",
