    "the unusual properties observed in a growing number of strongly correlated metals that are close to a continuous zero temperature phase transitions at the brink of magnetism have resulted in attempts of addressing the critical properties within a description beyond the ginzburg - landau - wilson paradigm . in the context of heavy fermion compounds , where the existence of unconventional quantum criticality has been experimentally verified ,",
    "it has become clear that one of the key questions concerns the fate of the kondo effect as the lattice undergoes a magnetic transition as a function of a tuning parameter , _",
    "e.g. _ pressure or magnetic field , and at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "a particularly promising alternative to the traditional hertz - millis - moriya or spin - density wave ( sdw ) scenario  @xcite is local quantum criticality ( lqc ) where kondo screening is critically destroyed at the quantum critical point ( qcp )  @xcite . within lqc",
    ", the qcp is characterized by a scale - invariant spectrum that results in dynamical or @xmath0-scaling of correlation functions .",
    "this is in line with a growing number of experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the study of correlated matter , including the heavy fermion systems , has undergone a considerable evolution over the past decades that led from the measurements of thermodynamic quantities like _ e.g. _ specific heat to modern microscopic probes of dynamic correlation functions . even for heavy fermion compounds which are dominated by an enhanced density of states in close vicinity of the fermi energy and concomitantly small characteristic energy scales , these spectroscopic probes , _",
    "e.g. _ angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( stm )  @xcite have recently become available .",
    "thus , arpes , stm , inelastic neutron scattering , etc .",
    "are capable of determining dynamic correlation functions and their scaling properties near quantum criticality .",

    "possessing a scale - invariant spectrum , _ i.e. _ in the absence of any intrinsic scale , any perturbation may probe the system in the non - linear regime beyond the validity of the fdt  @xcite .",
    "understanding the properties of quantum criticality out of equilibrium has accordingly become a topical issue .",
    "this applies to both its theoretical description as well as its experimental signatures .    here",
    ", we address the concept of effective temperatures in the context of quantum critical steady states far from equilibrium , both for the sdw as well as for a model of critical kondo destruction , and present an analysis of a non - interacting , critical reference system , the pseudogap resonant level model , in terms of effective temperatures and contrast these results with those obtained near fully interacting quantum critical points .",
    "the notion of an effective temperature ( t@xmath1 ) has originally been introduced in the context of turbulence by hohenberg and shraiman  @xcite and later extended to glassy systems displaying slow , relaxational dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is that specific features of an out - of - equilibrium problem can be described in terms of a thermal ensemble at an effective temperature t@xmath1 .",

    "i.e. _ systems close to a finite - temperature continuous phase transition , the usefulness and range of validity of the notion of t@xmath1has been explored in a number of works  @xcite . in particular , calabrese and gambassi were able to show that even if t@xmath1is observable independent at the level of the gaussian or mean field approximation , the inclusion of higher order contributions beyond the gaussian level will in general make t@xmath1observable dependent  @xcite .    in what follows , we will restrict ourselves to the simplest possible case , _",
    "i.e. _ , to purely dissipative dynamics , which is often referred to as model a dynamics  @xcite : within the ginzburg - landau - wilson framework , the time derivative of the order parameter is related to the order parameter derivative of the free energy functional . depending on whether the order parameter is conserved or not , the relaxation rate in the long - wavelength limit does or does not vanish .",
