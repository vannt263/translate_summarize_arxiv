    "discovery of high-@xmath17 quasars has demonstrated the existence of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) with @xmath18 m@xmath1 already at the age of the universe @xmath19 gyr ( e.g. , fan 2006 ; willott et al . 2007",
    "; mortlock et al . 2011 ) .",
    "as an origin of such smbhs , seed bh formation as a remnant of population iii stars ( @xmath20 m@xmath1 ) and their subsequent growth by merger and gas accretion have been studied by a number of authors ( e.g. , haiman & loeb 2001 ; volonteri , haardt & madau 2003 ; li et al .",
    "even with the eddington accretion rate @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the eddington luminosity and @xmath23 is the radiative efficiency , the growth time @xmath24 gyr becomes as long as the age of the universe at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 gyr ) : the seed bhs are thus required to keep growing at the eddington rate . however , negative feedbacks by the growing bhs prevent such efficient accretion ( milosavljevi , couch & bromm 2009 ; alvarez , wise & abel 2009 ; jeon et al .",
    "2011 ) .    as a solution to this",
    ", alternative possibility of massive seed bh formation by direct collapse of supermassive stars ( sms ; @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) has been considered by some authors .",
    "specifically , sms formation in massive halos ( @xmath27 k ) irradiated with strong far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation has often been studied ( e.g. , bromm & loeb 2003 ; regan & haehnelt 2009a , b ; shang , bryan , & haiman 2010 ) .",
    "since h@xmath8 molecule , the main coolant in the primordial gas , is photodissociated with strong fuv radiation in the lyman and werner bands , clouds under such an environment collapse isothermally at @xmath10 k by ly@xmath28 cooling without fragmentation , if they are massive enough with @xmath0 m@xmath1 . as an outcome of such collapse",
    ", smss are expected to form .",
    "a massive seed bh as a remnant of sms collapse reduces the growth time to @xmath29 m@xmath1 within @xmath30 gyr and mitigates the growth - time problem by a big margin .",
    "this scenario , however , has a serious drawback : for this mechanism of sms formation to work , extremely strong fuv radiation @xmath31 ( in a unit of @xmath32 erg s@xmath33 @xmath34 hz@xmath33 sr@xmath33 ) is required ( omukai 2001 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ; shang , bryan & haiman 2010 ) , while the fraction of halos irradiated with such intense fuv fields with @xmath35 is estimated to be @xmath36 at @xmath37 ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2008 ) , i.e. , only extremely rare halos satisfy the condition for sms formation .",
    "moreover , if high energy components , such as cosmic rays or x - rays , are present along with the fuv radiation , their ionization effect promotes the h@xmath8 formation and then strongly suppresses the sms formation ( inayoshi & omukai 2011 ) .",
    "although the above scenario might be still viable considering the rarity of high - z smbhs , it is worthwhile to explore another possibility .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new scenario for sms formation in post - shock gas of cold accretion flows in forming first galaxies .",
    "recent numerical simulations of galaxy formation have revealed that , in halos with virial temperature @xmath27 k , the shock position does not stay at the virial radius and shrinks inside owing to the efficient ly@xmath6 cooling , and the accreting cold gas penetrates deep to the center through dense filamentary flows ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; kere et al . 2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ; bromm & yoshida 2011 ) . the supersonic flows collide each other and the resultant shock develops a hot and dense ( @xmath3 k and @xmath4 @xmath5 ) gas near the center ( wise & abel 2007 ; greif et al . 2008 ; wise , turk & abel 2008 ) . by studying thermal evolution of the shocked gas",
    ", we have found that , if the post - shock density is high enough for the h@xmath8 rovibrational levels to reach the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , the efficient collisional dissociation suppresses h@xmath8 cooling , and the gas can not cool below several thousand k. massive clouds with @xmath0 m@xmath1 formed by fragmentation of the post - shock layer subsequently collapse isothermally at @xmath10 k by the ly@xmath28 cooling . without further fragmentation , monolithic collapse of the clouds results in the sms formation .",
    "note that , unlike the previous sms formation mechanism , strong fuv radiation is not required in our scenario .",
    "similar analysis has also been carried out by safranek - shrader , bromm & milosavljevi ( 2010 ) , who studied the fragmentation of the cold - stream shocked layer considering the effects of radiation field and chemical enrichment , but for a single post - shock condition ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 k , and the equilibrium chemical abundances ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the model for calculation of thermal evolution in the shocked gas . in section 3",
    ", we present our results and clarify the conditions for isothermal collapse leading to the sms formation in terms of post - shock density and temperature . effects of metal enrichment is also considered here . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze thermal processes in the shocked gas and discuss the reason for the bifurcation of thermal evolution in more detail .",
    "finally , we summarize our study and present some discussions in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we describe our model for calculation of thermal evolution in hot and dense shocked regions formed by collision of cold accretion flows in the first galaxies .",
    "we consider the thermal evolution in the post - shock layer under the assumption that the flow is steady and plane - parallel . since the post - shock temperature is as high as the virial temperature of first - galaxy forming halos ( @xmath27 k ) , cooling by the ly@xmath28 emission is efficient early on .",
    "the post - shock flow is compressed almost isobarically as long as the gas cools effectively ( e.g. , shapiro & kang 1987 ) . within the steady - state approximation",
    ", the conservation of mass and momentum leads to the following relationships between the density @xmath40 , pressure @xmath41 , and flow velocity @xmath42 just behind the shock with those in the post - shock flow @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 : @xmath46 @xmath47 along this flow , we solve the energy equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the internal energy per unit volume , @xmath50 is the lagrangian time derivative , and @xmath51 is the net cooling rate per unit volume . assuming a strong shock and neglecting the thermal pressure in the pre - shock flow , @xmath52 is satisfied just behind the shock front . thus , we approximate the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : shock2 ] ) by @xmath53 .",
    "the cooling term @xmath51 includes the radiative cooling by h , h@xmath8 and hd , and cooling / heating associated with chemical reactions .",
    "we solve the chemical reactions of primordial gas among the following 14 species ; h , h@xmath8 , e@xmath54 , h@xmath55 , h@xmath56 , h@xmath54 , he , he@xmath55 , he@xmath57 , d , hd , d@xmath55 , hd@xmath55 , and d@xmath54 .",
    "we adopt the same coefficients for the cooling / heating and the chemical reactions as in inayoshi & omukai ( 2011 ) except for omitting the radiative / cosmic - ray ionization and dissociation in this calculation . in studying effects of metal enrichment",
    ", we add the cooling by the fine - structure - line emission of c@xmath58 and o@xmath59 to the primordial processes described above . assuming the fraction of metals depleted to dust grains to be the same as in the galactic interstellar gas , we set the number fractions of c and o nuclei in the gas phase with respect to h nuclei to @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( pollack et al .",
    "we follow hollenbach & mckee ( 1989 ) in calculating the cooling rates of c@xmath58 and o@xmath59 .",
    "we curtail the c and o chemistry by simply assuming that all the c and o are in the states of c@xmath58 and o@xmath59 , respectively , from the following consideration : with lower ionization energy ( @xmath62 ev ) than h atom , c is photoionized by weak background radiation and in the state of c@xmath58 , while o is in ionization equilibrium with h and almost neutral for @xmath63 k , where the o@xmath59 cooling is important .",
    "molecular cooling of metals ( e.g. , co and h@xmath8o ) is not included since its cooling is not important in the temperature range relevant for the bifurcation of thermal evolution ( @xmath64 several 10@xmath65 k ) .",
    "next , we consider the condition for the gravitational instability during the isobaric compression of the post - shock layer and thus for its fragmentation . for the isobaric compression ,",
    "the dynamical time @xmath66 , which characterizes thermal evolution , is approximately equal to the cooling time @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number density of h nuclei and @xmath69 is the temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the growth timescale for the gravitational instability is given by the free - fall time ( e.g. , larson 1985 ) @xmath70    as long as the cooling is effective enough and so @xmath71 , the post - shock layer continues to be compressed isobarically .",
    "however , once the cooling becomes ineffective and @xmath72 exceeds @xmath73 , the contraction of the layer halts and a dense layer begins to develop inside the post - shock region .",
    "for example , since the growth rate of the baryonic mass in halos of @xmath74 m@xmath1 at @xmath37 is @xmath75 m@xmath76 ( dekel et al . 2009 ) , a gas of @xmath0 m@xmath1 can accumulate in @xmath77 yrs .",
    "if sufficient gas supply is available through the accretion flow , the dense layer eventually satisfies the jeans criterion , i.e. , the sound - crossing time @xmath78 becomes longer than the free - fall time ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the layer then fragments by the gravitational instability to produce jeans - scale clouds . in this paper , assuming that the continuous gas supply to induce the jeans instability is available , we estimate the fragmentation mass scale by the condition @xmath80 in accordance with yamada & nishi ( 1998 ) .",
    "after fragmentation , the cloud collapses with its self - gravity , and its evolution can not be modelled as a steady flow anymore .",
    "density evolution in a cloud collapsing by the self - gravity is described by the penston - larson self - similar solution ( penston 1969 ; larson 1969 ) , which has density profile with a flat core of the jeans scale and an envelope with the power - law density distribution @xmath81 .",
    "the density in the central core roughly increases in the free - fall timescale .",
    "we here calculate the evolution in the central - core part by using a one - zone model , where the density evolution is given by @xmath82 namely , after the condition for fragmentation ( @xmath83 ) is satisfied , we switch the density evolution described by equations ( [ eq : shock1])-([eq : shock2 ] ) to that by equation ( [ eq : density ] ) in our calculation and solve equation ( [ eq : shock3 ] ) for this density evolution .",
    "when the collapse proceeds significantly and the cloud becomes optically thick , the radiative cooling becomes ineffective due to photon trapping .",
    "we assume the radius of the core to be half a jeans length @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "since we consider the core of the collapsing cloud , the column density of i - th species is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is its concentration . using this value , we estimate the optical depth and the reduction rate of radiative cooling as in inayoshi & omukai ( 2011 ) .      according to numerical simulations of the first galaxy formation ( e.g. , greif et al .",
    "2008 ; wise et al .",
    "2008 ) , the pre - shock number density and temperature of cold flows and the shock velocity are typically @xmath88 @xmath5 , 200 k , and 20 km s@xmath33 , respectively , which correspond to the post - shock density @xmath89 @xmath5 and temperature @xmath90 k. with those fiducial values in mind , we carry out calculations for a wide range of initial number density and temperature : @xmath91 and @xmath92 . since h@xmath8 , the main coolant below @xmath93 k , forms through the electron - catalyzed reactions @xmath94 the initial ionization degree @xmath95 , along with the initial h@xmath8 concentration @xmath96 , is important quantities for the subsequent thermal evolution . in reference to the results of kang & shapiro ( 1992 ) , who studied the chemical abundances in the pre - shock gas considering photo - ionization and dissociation by uv radiation emitted from the shock , we regard @xmath97 and @xmath98 as typical ionization degree and molecular fraction , respectively .",
    "however , since cold accretion flows are far denser ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) than the range kang & shapiro ( 1992 ) assumed ( @xmath99 @xmath5 ) , the electron recombination as well as the shielding of the uv photo - ionization / dissociation probably lower the pre - shock ionization degree @xmath95 and elevate molecular fraction @xmath100 from those values .",
    "taking this uncertainty into account , we study the cases with a wide range of initial ionization degree and h@xmath8 fraction : @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "in this section , we present our results for thermal evolution after the gas experiences the cold accretion shock .",
    "we first consider the cases of primordial gas and then discuss effects of small metal enrichment .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] , we show the temperature evolution of primordial gas for four post - shock conditions , indicated by two each open and filled circles .",
    "we here set the initial ionization degree and molecular fraction to @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "first , we see the cases from the open - circle initial conditions in fig . [",
    "fig : region ] , whose temperature evolution is shown by the dashed lines . in the lower initial - density case ( @xmath105 , @xmath106)=(@xmath107 @xmath5 , @xmath108 k ) among them ,",
    "the post - shock gas cools by the ly@xmath28 emission and is compressed isobarically .",
    "although the ly@xmath28 cooling becomes inefficient below @xmath93 k , enough h@xmath8 for cooling has already been formed by this time , which enables further temperature decrease .",
    "hd is formed abundantly for @xmath109 k , whose cooling eventually lowers the temperature to @xmath110 k. at this point , without efficient coolant anymore , @xmath72 becomes longer than @xmath73 .",
    "clouds with jeans mass of several @xmath111 m@xmath1 are produced by the gravitational instability .",
    "also , in the case of lower initial temperature ( @xmath112 @xmath5 , @xmath113 k ) , abundant h@xmath8 is formed immediately .",
    "the cooling by h@xmath8 and then by hd allows the temperature to plummet isobarically until @xmath114 k , where the fragmentation mass scale of a few @xmath111 m@xmath1 is imprinted . in both the cases , temperature evolution after fragmentation converges to the well - known track for clouds collapsing by the self - gravity and cooling by h@xmath8 and hd ( lower thin solid line ; uehara & inutsuka 2000 ; nagakura & omukai 2005 ) .",
    "next , we see the two cases starting from the filled - circle initial conditions in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] , whose evolutionary tracks are indicated by the dash - dotted lines . in the higher initial temperature case ( @xmath115 @xmath5 , @xmath108 k )",
    ", the gas cools isobarically until @xmath93 k as in the open - circle cases . at @xmath10",
    "k , however , the density exceeds @xmath3 @xmath5 , the critical density for h@xmath8 to reach lte . for higher density , h@xmath8",
    "is rapidly dissociated collisionally from the excited rovibrational levels , and thus sufficient h@xmath8 for cooling is never formed .",
    "consequently , the gas can not cool below @xmath10 k , and massive clouds with @xmath116 are formed by fragmentation . also , in the case of initial temperature somewhat lower than 8000 k ( @xmath117 @xmath5 , @xmath118 k ) , h@xmath8 cooling is suppressed by the collisional dissociation and fragmentation occurs immediately producing massive clouds with @xmath116 , whose temperature increases to @xmath93 k by the compressional heating in the course of gravitational collapse . in both cases ,",
    "the massive clouds thereafter collapse almost isothermally by the ly@xmath6 cooling until very high density ( @xmath119 @xmath5 ) , where the cloud becomes optically thick to the h@xmath54 bound - free absorption ( omukai 2001 ) .",
    "such isothermally contracting clouds do not fragment in the later phase and thus collapse monolithically to smss , which eventually evolve to seeds of smbhs ( bromm & loeb 2003 ; shang , bryan & haiman 2010 ) .",
    "as seen above , the behaviors of thermal evolution can be classified into two types .",
    "the thick solid line in fig .  [ fig : region ] corresponds to the boundary of initial conditions , from the above or below which subsequent thermal evolution bifurcates .",
    "namely , the post - shock conditions above the boundary ( the hatched region ) lead to the isothermal evolution at @xmath10 k , while those below it result in the isobaric temperature decrease until @xmath120 k. the boundary on the low - density side ( @xmath121 ) can be fitted as @xmath122 this means that , after isobaric cooling to @xmath93 k , if the density exceeds the h@xmath8 critical value for lte ( @xmath3 @xmath5 ) , the gas can not continue further isobaric compression and starts isothermal collapse . for higher densities @xmath123 ,",
    "the boundary is given by @xmath124 in section 4 , we discuss physical processes determining the location of the boundary in more detail .",
    "we mention the effect of initial chemical composition on thermal evolution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : e ] , we show the boundaries for the sms - forming conditions for different initial ionization degrees ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the positions of the boundaries are almost independent of @xmath95 for @xmath125 @xmath5 , while the portions at @xmath126 @xmath5 move to lower density with decreasing @xmath95 . in particular , for @xmath127 , this results in the spiky domain around @xmath93 k extending as low as @xmath128 @xmath5 . with the higher initial ionization degree ,",
    "the more h@xmath8 is formed by the electron - catalyzed reactions ( [ eq : h- ] ) , which results in the wider range of post - shock conditions for h@xmath8 cooling , i.e. , the smaller range for sms formation .",
    "the boundary for @xmath129 asymptotically approaches that for higher @xmath95 at @xmath130 k since the ionization degree jumps up immediately to @xmath131 , even with smaller initial value , by effective collisional ionization @xmath132 in this temperature range .",
    "we also studied the cases with different molecular fraction @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and found that the boundaries for sms formation is almost independent of @xmath96 .",
    "this is because , even with high initial value , h@xmath8 is rapidly dissociated collisionally for @xmath135 , and its fraction reaches the equilibrium one , which is independent of initial value .",
    "next , we consider the cases with slight metal enrichment . in fig .",
    "[ fig : metal ] , we present the boundaries for sms - forming initial conditions for various metallicities with @xmath136 . with some metals , cooling by the fine - structure line emission of c@xmath58 and o@xmath59 can exceed that by h@xmath8 and plays an important role in thermal evolution . with metallicity as low as @xmath137 z@xmath1 ,",
    "the metal cooling does not affect thermal evolution around 8000 k and the boundary does not move from the primordial case .",
    "as seen in section 3.1 , from initial conditions hotter and denser than the boundary ( i.e. , the hatched region of fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] ) , enough h@xmath8 for cooling is not formed and only massive clouds are produced , which collapse isothermally thereafter . with increasing metallicity ,",
    "the metal - line cooling becomes able to make the gas to cool below @xmath138 k isobarically even without h@xmath8 .",
    "once the temperature decreases and the collisional dissociation becomes ineffective , abundant h@xmath8 eventually forms and the gas cools to @xmath120 k by its cooling . by this additional cooling , the boundary of the sms - forming initial conditions moves to higher density .",
    "with metallicity as high as @xmath139 , the cooling rate by c@xmath58 and o@xmath59 becomes comparable to the compressional heating at @xmath10 k and @xmath3 @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , even without help of h@xmath8 cooling , the metal cooling alone is able to lower the temperature to the range where the h@xmath8 collisional dissociation is ineffective , and thus the boundary shifts to higher density .    in summary , with metallicity higher than the critical value @xmath140 ,",
    "the boundary density becomes far higher than the typical post - shock value by the cold accretion shock @xmath141 and such an initial condition would be very difficult to be realized .",
    "thus the possibility of sms formation is strongly reduced for higher metallicity . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as @xmath142 , the range of initial conditions for sms formation remains the same as in the primordial case .",
    "in this section , we explain what processes are responsible for the bifurcation of thermal evolution in the region where the cold accretion shock is thermalized , and give a physical interpretation for the location of the bifurcation boundary for the post - shock conditions in figs .  [",
    "fig : region ] and [ fig : e ] .",
    "efficient ly@xmath6 cooling drives temperature in a hot gas rapidly to @xmath7 k , where its cooling rate is sharply cut off as the atomic hydrogen is not excited for lower temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool_rec ] , we show the cut - off temperature ( dotted line ) , below which h@xmath8 takes over the role of the dominant coolant .",
    "thus , for the post - shock gas to continue the isobaric cooling below @xmath93 k , the h@xmath8 cooling must become effective and keep the cooling time @xmath72 shorter than the free - fall time @xmath73 .",
    "the cooling time by the h@xmath8 cooling is given by @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the cooling rate per an h@xmath8 molecule ( erg s@xmath33 ) and has the density dependence @xmath145 ( @xmath146 @xmath5 is the h@xmath8 critical density for lte ) . in conditions under consideration ( below the dotted line of fig .",
    "[ fig : cool_rec ] ) , the h@xmath8 fraction @xmath100 is set by the equilibrium between the electron - catalyzed formation reaction and collisional dissociation reaction , and so @xmath147 where @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) and @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) are reaction rate coefficients for the indicated reactions , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath150 depends on the fraction of h@xmath8 in excited states and thus on the density .",
    "the rate coefficient @xmath150 significantly increases with density near the h@xmath8 critical density @xmath152 , which results in the rapid decrease of @xmath100 by the effective collisional dissociation at @xmath153 @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath100 is proportional to @xmath154 , the recombination also can be a key reaction to determine @xmath72 ( @xmath155 ) at @xmath63 k. since the recombination time @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ; @xmath158 is the recombination rate coefficient ) has the same dependence on @xmath154 as @xmath72 , the ratio of these two timescales becomes independent of @xmath154 and is approximately given by @xmath159 the last expression above is valid for the density and temperature around @xmath160 and @xmath125 @xmath5 , and the large temperature dependence of equation ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) is due to that of @xmath150 .",

    "if the density at @xmath7 k is high enough ( @xmath125 @xmath5 ) to make the h@xmath8 rovibrational levels to reach the local thermodynamic equilibrium , the h@xmath8 is dissociated effectively by the collisional reaction from excited levels , which suppresses the cooling to lower temperature by h@xmath8 . at this epoch ,",
    "gravitational instability of the post - shock layer produces massive fragments with @xmath0 m@xmath1 , which subsequently collapse isothermally at @xmath10 k by the ly@xmath28 cooling .",
    "we have studied thermal evolution of the post - shock gas for a wide range of initial conditions ( @xmath178 @xmath179 @xmath5 and @xmath180 k@xmath181 k ) and have pinned down the conditions leading to the isothermal collapse ( the hatched region in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] ) : @xmath182 k for @xmath121 and @xmath183 k for @xmath123 , for the pre - shock ionization degree at @xmath103 . since h@xmath8 is formed by the electron - catalyzed reactions ( eq .",
    "[ eq : h- ] ) , the above condition depends somewhat on the initial ionization degree ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : e ] ) : for smaller @xmath95 , the domain of initial conditions leading to the isothermal collapse extends towards lower density .",
    "those massive clouds continue isothermal collapse until very high density @xmath119 @xmath5 , where they become optically thick to the h@xmath54 bound - free absorption ( omukai 2001 ) .",
    "the clouds are supposed to collapse directly to smss without further fragmentation ( e.g. , bromm & loeb 2003 ; regan & haehnelt 2009a , b ; shang , bryan , & haiman 2010 ) . eventually , the smss collapse by the post - newtonian instability , swallowing most of their material , to become seeds of smbhs ( shibata & shapiro 2002 ) .    the first galaxies may be enriched with metals to some extent as well as dusts dispersed by supernova ( sn ) explosions of previous generations of stars . with high enough metallicity",
    ", the gas can cool to low temperature ( @xmath114 k ) by metal - line cooling alone even without h@xmath8 . in this case",
    ", the sms formation would be strongly suppressed .",
    "we have then repeated the same analysis by considering as well as the metal cooling by c@xmath58 and o@xmath59 .",
    "we have found that as long as the metallicity is lower than @xmath184 z@xmath1 , the metal - line cooling does not change the condition for sms formation from that in the primordial case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : metal ] ) . according to some cosmological simulations of the assembly of first galaxies ( greif et al .",
    "2010 ; wise et al .",
    "2012 ) , the dense gas at the center of galaxies is uniformly enriched to @xmath185 z@xmath1 by a pair instability sn of massive population iii stars with @xmath186 . on the other hand , typical population iii stars",
    "are recently considered to be less massive @xmath187 ( hosokawa et al .",
    "2011 ; stacy , greif & bromm 2011 ) and end their lives as ordinary core collapse sne . in this case",
    ", the resultant metallicity reduces by a factor of @xmath18810 ( heger & woosley 2002 ; nomoto et al .",
    "2006 ) and thus becomes lower than the critical metallicity for sms formation we estimated .",
    "we here stress that our scenario naturally explains the formation of seed bhs in the conditions of first - galaxy formation without invoking extremely strong uv radiation as envisaged in the previous scenario .",
    "the necessary condition for sms formation in halos with @xmath27 k is the isothermal collapse by the atomic cooling as a result of suppression of the h@xmath8 cooling in the entire density range .",
    "so far , as a mechanism to suppress h@xmath8 cooling , photodissociation by fuv radiation has been considered . in this scenario , however , extremely strong fuv intensity @xmath31 ( in unit of @xmath32 erg s@xmath33 @xmath34 hz@xmath33 sr@xmath33 ) is required to quench the h@xmath8 cooling ( omukai 2001 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ; shang , bryan & haiman 2010 ) , and halos irradiated by such intense radiation are extremely rare ( @xmath36 at @xmath37 ; dijkstra et al .",
    "moreover , if external ionization by cosmic rays or x - rays , which promotes the h@xmath8 formation , is present as well , the fuv intensity needed for smbh formation is elevated",
    ". there would be little possibility ( @xmath189 ) for such an intense fuv field to be realized in any haloes and thus the sms formation could strongly suppressed ( inayoshi & omukai 2011 ) . on the other hand , in our scenario , collisional dissociation , rather than photodissociation ,",
    "suppresses the h@xmath8 cooling .",
    "thus , even without fuv radiation , which has been considered to be indispensable previously , the isothermal collapse and thus sms formation can be realized as long as the right condition is met for the cold accretion shock .",
    "note , however , this mechanism for sms formation can not operate in all first galaxies since smbhs are rare objects . if we use the number density of halos with mass @xmath190 at @xmath37 , @xmath191 ( comoving ) and assume each of them had a sms of @xmath192 , the predicted mass density of smbhs @xmath193 ( comoving ) will exceed the total present - day bh mass density @xmath194 estimated by yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , our conditions for sms formation would be satisfied only in a small fraction of first galaxies or some other processes , e.g. , turbulent fragmentation , lack of accreting material etc .",
    ", suppress this mechanism to work for avoiding overproduction of bhs .",
    "we here briefly discuss the effect of dust cooling , which has not been considered in this paper .",
    "if the depletion factor of metals to dust grains is as high as the present - day galactic value @xmath195 , the thermal evolution deviates from the isothermal one at @xmath196 @xmath5 due to the dust cooling , if metallicity is higher than @xmath197 ( omukai , schneider & haiman 2008 ) .",
    "although this critical metallicity @xmath198 is smaller than the critical value due to metal - line cooling @xmath199 by two orders of magnitude , the depletion factor in the first - galaxy forming environment is highly uncertain . according to theoretical models of dust formation and destruction in the first sne , typically only a few % of dust formed at the explosion survives , after being swept by the reverse shock , depending on the ambient density ( nozawa , kozasa & habe 2006 ; bianchi & schneider 2007 ) .",
    "for example , with @xmath200 , the critical metallicity becomes @xmath201 , which makes the constraint on metal pollution less severe . in any case , to predict whether the isothermal collapse continues in spite of metal enrichment , we need more accurate knowledge of the depletion factor @xmath202 .    in this paper , we consider the hot and dense central regions owing to shocks by the cold accretion flows in the forming first galaxies . likewise , a galaxy merging event drives inflows , creating a similar environment around the galaxy center ( e.g. , mayer et al .",
    "if the shocked region satisfies our post - shock criterion for the h@xmath8 collisional dissociation , the sms formation is expected also in this case . in merging galaxies , however , star formation and also metal enrichment are expected to have already proceeded significantly . therefore , in the case of the inflows by galaxy merger , sms formation is probably prohibited by the metal - cooling effect .",
    "the cold accretion shocks in the first galaxy formation would provide more easily the suitable conditions for sms formation .",
    "recently , assuming seed bhs with @xmath192 , di matteo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and khandai et al .",
    "( 2011 ) discussed their growth by the cold accretion flows in the process of the first galaxy formation .",
    "their results demonstrate that the cold flows are less susceptible to feedbacks from the growing bhs and high accretion rate is maintained until mass of the galaxy reaches @xmath203 , where the cold mode of accretion turns the usual hot virialization mode . as a result , the bh is able to grow to @xmath204 by @xmath205 .",
    "our scenario for the sms formation provides a mechanism for seeding bhs of @xmath192 in forming galaxies , which has been assumed in studies of di matteo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and khandai et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , while their results complementary demonstrated those seed bhs can in fact grow to smbhs .",
    "finally , we remark remaining issues to be explored . in our scenario ,",
    "the physical condition in the post - shock gas ( especially , its density ) is crucial for the sms formation .",
    "we have considered a range of density ( @xmath206 ) and temperature ( @xmath207 k ) as the post - shock conditions .",
    "currently , we only know the typical values of those parameters ( greif et al . 2008 ; wise et al .",
    "2008 ) , but are still lacking knowledge of the relationship between the post - shock conditions and formation conditions ( i.e. , mass , virialization epoch , etc . ) of first galaxies .",
    "in addition , our assumption that the enough mass supply for jeans instability is available through the streaming flow is need further investigation .",
    "safranek - shrader et al .",
    "( 2010 ) evaluated the amount of accreted gas to be @xmath208 , which is inhomogeneously organized by turbulence ( e.g. , wise & abel 2007 ; greif et al .",
    "therefore , the outcome of the shocked material in most of halos could be numerous small sub - regions , rather than a massive layer envisaged in this paper .",
    "on the other hand , even if the turbulent motion dominates , a gravitational unstable cloud with @xmath209 m@xmath1 could form in the center and collapse subsequently ( wise et al . 2008 ) . as a future project",
    ", we need to study in what halos the sms forming conditions are satisfied by way of realistic cosmological simulations , including e.g. , molecular cooling and the radiative and chemical feedbacks , for evaluating more quantitatively the feasibility of sms formation in the first galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we have supposed that , for the sms formation , massive clouds must collapse isothermally without fragmentation .",
    "in fact , three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations by bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) confirmed in some cases that the cloud collapsing isothermally by the atomic cooling does not experience fragmentation at least in the range @xmath210 @xmath5 and , consequently , a supermassive clump forms at the center .",
    "even with some angular momentum , fragmentation resulted at most in a binary system in their calculation .",
    "however , depending on such initial conditions as degrees of rotation or turbulence , the clouds would fragment into less massive clumps during the isothermal collapse . as a future study",
    ", it is awaited to clarify the conditions under which the clouds elude fragmentation by way of three - dimensional hydrodynamical calculation .",
    "we would like to thank takashi nakamura for his continuous encouragement , and takashi hosokawa and sanemichi takahashi for the fruitful discussion .",
