    "rrl stars have been found in considerable numbers in all metal - poor components of the galaxy ; among these rrl are galactic globular cluster variables as well as field variables in the halo , thick disk , and bulge .",
    "rrl stars fall into two distinct regions in period / amplitude space and are thus categorized as fundamental mode ( rrab ) or first - overtone ( rrc ) variables whose light curves exhibit characteristic periods , amplitudes , and shapes @xcite .",

    ", the exposure times ranged from 300 to 600 seconds in @xmath2 band and 180 to 600 seconds in @xmath3 band . for segue 3 , the exposure times varied from 180 to 300 seconds in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 band .",
    "the exposures were taken alternating between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands , and the minimum time between subsequent exposures was set by a read - out time of approximately three minutes .",
    "the s2 kb ccd camera is an array of 2048 by 2048 pixels with a scale of 0.6 arcseconds per pixel .",
    "both segue 2 ( @xmath39 , @xcite ) and segue 3 ( @xmath40 , @xcite ) were fully captured within the @xmath41 by @xmath41 field of view .    to prepare the images for analysis ,",
    "the exposures were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded using dome flats , and trimmed to remove the overscan region .",
    "the daophot ii and allstar ii packages were used to perform psf photometry on all of the images @xcite .",
    "we allowed the point - spread function to vary quadratically as a function of position . to assess the point source detection completeness of our photometry , we matched stars from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ) @xcite to our detected sources within the footprint of our observations .",
    "for both the segue 2 and 3 fields , our photometric catalog includes @xmath42 of sdss stars brighter than @xmath43 mags within our footprint , well below the apparent @xmath3 band magnitude of the horizontal branches of these objects ( see  3 and  4 ) .",
    "sdss dr7 is @xmath44 complete to @xmath45 , @xmath46 mags , so we infer a similarly high point source detection completeness for our data . while this comparison with sdss does nt itself account for crowding incompleteness , neither",
    "segue 2 nor segue 3 are crowded in their central regions .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that we have missed an rrl star in either segue 2 or segue 3 owing to photometric incompleteness , but we can not rule out the possibility with @xmath42 confidence .",
    "the online resource astrometry.net was used to obtain astrometric headers for each exposure .",
    "we accessed astrometry.net with a python script to enable automated processing of all exposures .",
    "we used this astrometry to facilitate cross - matching sources between the s2 kb exposures and also to the sdss dr7 catalog .",
    "since the astrometry in the sdss catalog is more precise than we could obtain for our kpno data , all coordinates reported in this paper come from sdss dr7 .",
    "the data were photometrically calibrated to sdss dr7 photometry .",
    "we transformed the sdss @xmath45 and @xmath47 magnitudes to @xmath2 and @xmath3 using the filter transformations of @xcite .",
    "the errors are on the order of a few hundredths of a magnitude for these filter transformations . in the segue 2 field ,",
    "the median errors on our standard magnitudes were thus increased from @xmath48 0.018 and 0.017 mag in @xmath45 and @xmath47 to @xmath48 0.037 and 0.020 mag in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "for the segue 3 field , the corresponding values were @xmath48 0.012 and 0.011 in @xmath45 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 0.029 and 0.016 in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "all magnitudes used for the light curves and distances presented in this paper have been corrected for dust using the ( * ? ? ?",

    "we used a maximum likelihood analysis to calibrate our data to sdss as a function of color , @xmath51-pixel position , and @xmath52-pixel position .",

    "we use the value reported by the allstar ii software .",
    "thus , a single color term ( @xmath66 ) is found for each data set , while a unique @xmath51 term ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath52 term ( @xmath68 ) , and zero point ( @xmath69 ) is found for each exposure . the final @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 terms and corresponding uncertainties are taken to be the median and standard deviation of the distributions obtained using a bootstrapping technique .",

    "we apply these terms and propagate their uncertainties into the calibrated data and corresponding uncertainties presented in the remainder of this paper .",
    "after the data are calibrated , evidence of small spatially dependent residuals is present in the segue 3 field ( but not in the segue 2 field ) .",
    "while the variable star in the segue 3 field presented in  4 resides on a part of the chip that appears relatively unaffected , the photometry for the star as presented in table 3 has an additional systematic uncertainty of a few hundredths of a magnitude .",

    "these include both random and systematic components of the uncertainty . to obtain an initial set of variable star candidates , we selected those stars for which @xmath96 for at least three exposures in either passband and from any observing epoch , as well as those sources which showed a change in magnitude of greater than 0.5 mags .",
    "we evaluate our ability to identify rrl stars as variable star candidates using these selection criteria by simulating rrl light curves at the cadence and precision of our calibrated observations over the full range of rrl period and amplitude parameter space .",
    "we base our simulations on a representative set of twenty rrab and two rrc @xmath45 and @xmath47 templates provided by @xcite and transformed to @xmath2 and @xmath3 using the transformations of @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties are simulated as gaussian random errors equal to the observed uncertainties ( including both random and systematic components ) for the rrab star in segue 2 ( see  3 ) , and for the candidate eclipsing binary in the segue 3 field ( see  4 ) .",
    "we use the eclipsing binary for segue 3 because its color and magnitude are broadly consistent with the instability strip of segue 3 .",
    "a total of 45,000 rrab light curves and 2,000 rrc light curves were simulated by taking linear steps through period , amplitude , and initial phase of observation .",
    "the period was varied from 0.3 to 1.0 days for rrab stars and from 0.1 to 0.55 days for rrc stars @xcite .",
    "the amplitude was varied from 0.4 to 1.8 mags and from 0.1 to 1.0 mags for rrab and rrc stars , respectively @xcite .",
    "we define the detection efficiency of our study as our ability to select our simulated rrl stars as variable star candidates using the selection criteria described above .",
    "note that this definition of the detection efficiency only assesses our ability to flag a source as a variable star candidate for further evaluation .",
    "it does not aim to assess the accuracy with which we recover the source s input parameters ( period , amplitude , etc . ) through means such as light curve template fitting .",
    "thus , our detection efficiency mainly assesses whether the cadence of our observations allows for sufficient sampling of rrl light curves to be able to use the selection criteria defined above to identify these light curves as variable .    in segue 3 ,",
    "nearly all of our simulated rrl were identified as variable star candidates for all periods and amplitudes simulated . in segue 2 , our identification of variable stars was similarly successful ; however , in several areas of period / amplitude parameter space , @xmath97 of sources failed to meet our selection criteria .",
    "these areas included rrab stars with the lowest amplitudes and longest periods ( 0.9 - 1.0 days ) , as well as those with amplitudes of @xmath98 mag .",
    "they also included rrc stars with amplitudes @xmath99 mag , with the longest periods again being the least detectable . given that rrab stars with periods greater than 0.9 days are rare @xcite , as are rrc stars with amplitudes below 0.2 mag @xcite , we are confident that the cadence of our observations combined with our selection criteria are sufficient for successfully identifying rrl stars as variable star candidates .    in our segue 2 and 3 observations , approximately 3% and 2% of stars were selected as variable star candidates , respectively .",
    "the raw light curves of these candidate variable stars ( magnitude vs. hjd ) were then visually inspected with particular attention paid to stars that varied in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 band , varied throughout the observing period , and/or showed potentially periodic changes in magnitude .",
    "the vast majority of variable star candidates were falsely identified as variable due to outliers in otherwise flat light curves , significant scatter in faint light curves , or proximity to other sources or to the edges of the exposures .",
    "a smaller number of stars ( @xmath100 per field ) showed non - periodic variation over some or all of the observing period . although further observation of these stars may inform our understanding of the stellar populations in and around segue 2 and 3 , their lack of periodic variation eliminated them from consideration as rrl stars . finally ,",
    "as discussed in section 4 , one clear periodic variable star was identified in each of the segue 2 and 3 fields .",
    "a periodic variable star was detected in segue 2 at ( ra , dec ) = ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) at a distance of 1.6 half - light radii from the center of the object .",
    "this star was found to be a spectroscopic member of segue 2 by @xcite .",
    "the variable has a period , amplitude , and sawtooth - shaped light curve consistent with that of a fundamental mode rrl star ( rrab ) . as shown in figure 1",
    ", the variable has a color and magnitude consistent with being an rrl member of segue 2 based on past measurements of the distance to segue 2 ( see @xcite ) and kpno and sdss photometry of the object .    to deduce the properties of the variable s light curve",
    ", we fit our observed @xmath2 and @xmath3 light curves with the rrab and rrc light curve templates of @xcite .",
    "the set consists of approximately twenty rrab and two rrc @xmath103 templates that span a distribution of light curve shapes derived from observations .",
    "the sdss @xmath45 and @xmath47 magnitudes of the templates were transformed to @xmath2 and @xmath3 using the filter transformations of @xcite .",
    "for all 420 rrab templates , we initially explored period and amplitude parameter space by conducting gridded searches for a minimum @xmath104 fit .",
    "as the template fitting was performed separately in @xmath2 and @xmath3 band , we define the @xmath104 value of a template fit as the sum of the @xmath104 values of its @xmath2 and @xmath3 band fits .",
    "we selected eight rrab templates as providing the most reasonable fits to the data ( i.e. @xmath105 ) .",
    "these templates were used to explore the range of possible periods and amplitudes using emcee , a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) routine @xcite .    for each template",
    ", the mcmc sampling returns the posterior distribution of the period and amplitude .",
    "we find a bi - modal distribution of periods and amplitudes consisting of a primary and secondary peak in the parameter space .",
    "although the template fitting was performed separately in @xmath2 and @xmath3 band , we selected a single best - fit template having the minimum sum of its @xmath104 values in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "for the primary peak among rrab templates , this best - fit template gives a period of @xmath106 days , a @xmath2 band amplitude of @xmath107 mag , and a @xmath3 band amplitude of @xmath108 mag . at a 68% confidence level ,",
    "the other seven templates are in good agreement with the first , providing periods as short as 0.742 days and as long as 0.769 days , @xmath2 band amplitudes that range from 0.596 to 0.667 mag , and @xmath3 band amplitudes that range from 0.493 to 0.564 mag . for the secondary peak ,",
    "the mcmc samples imply a shorter period ( @xmath109 days ) and smaller amplitude ( @xmath110 ) . however , the light curve templates in this peak yield much larger @xmath104 values than in the primary peak , and a visual comparison of the light curves and the data reveals them to provide a poor match .",
    "furthermore , lomb - scargle periodograms constructed for both bandpasses suggest a most probable period of @xmath111 days , which is broadly consistent with the period of the primary peak .    additionally , we assessed the likelihood that the variable could instead be an rrc star by exploring period and amplitude parameter space with emcee using two rrc templates .",
    "however , the rrc templates generally yield large @xmath104 values and poor visual matches to the data .",
    "the only rrc template fits that have @xmath104 values comparable to the rrab fits in the primary peak have periods on the order of 0.75 days , much longer than expected for this class of variable .",
    "thus , this star does not meet the characteristic profile of an rrc star .",
    "figure 2 shows the variable s period folded @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 light curves , with the best fit template overploted . by integrating the set of light curve templates consistent with the observed light curve at a 68% confidence level or better ,",
    "we calculate a flux - averaged @xmath2 band magnitude of @xmath115 mags and a flux - averaged @xmath3 band magnitude of @xmath116 mags .",
    "while using this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty in @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the resulting uncertainty bars on the magnitudes are not themselves formal 68% confidence intervals .",
    "the star has a median color of @xmath119 and varies in color from @xmath120 to @xmath121 over the course of the pulsational period , displaying the increase in @xmath15 at minimum light that is characteristic of rrl stars @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the point - to - point scatter in these light curves appears smaller than expected given the size of the error bars , which include both random and systematic uncertainties .",
    "this small point - to - point scatter suggests that the random uncertainties are overestimated by allstar ii and/or the systematic uncertainties are highly correlated from exposure - to - exposure .",
    "the systematic uncertainties account for up to 50% of the error . although the systematics are likely correlated , we chose to include them in the error bars because they are derived separately for each exposure and because they must be included in the error budget for the rrl s distance estimate in  3.2 .      here , we briefly discuss segue 2 s rrl star in the context of the rrl populations of other milky way dwarf galaxy companions . historically , rrab stars in the milky way s halo , globular clusters , and dwarf galaxies have been classified according to their oosterhoff properties @xcite .",
    "rrab stars with short periods and large amplitudes are classified as oosterhoff i ( ooi ) stars , and those with longer periods and smaller amplitudes are deemed oosterhoff ii ( ooii ) stars .",
    "milky way globular clusters are known to show an oosterhoff gap , or an absence of clusters with @xmath122(days)@xmath123 . however , milky way dwarf galaxies do not display this same dichotomy , and instead largely fall in the oosterhoff intermediate to ooii classifications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    among galactic globular clusters ,",
    "an ooii classification is associated with the most metal - poor systems ( [ fe / h ] @xmath124 ) , with a weak negative correlation between the mean rrab period and metallicity @xcite . for dwarf galaxies of the milky way , which are also metal - poor",
    ", a similar correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 \\rangle$ ] also exists ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to place the oosterhoff classification and long period of segue 2 s rrab star in a more specific context , we revisit the relation between mean rrab period and mean metallicity for dwarf galaxies using homogeneously calculated values obtained with a method that remains robust for ultra - faint systems whose metallicity distributions may be poorly sampled .",
    "we use the uniformly calculated set of @xmath125 \\rangle$ ] and associated uncertainties found by @xcite by applying a bayesian mcmc technique to published [ fe / h ] measurements based on iron lines and their accompanying uncertainties .",
    "a similar technique was applied to re - calculate @xmath5 and associated uncertainties from the most current surveys of variable stars in ultra - faint dwarfs .    in figure 3 , we compare segue 2 s rrab period and mean metallicity with those of other milky way dwarf galaxies with predominantly old stellar populations .",
    "the long period ( @xmath4 days ) and the amplitude ( @xmath126 mag ) of segue 2 s rrab star as well as the dwarf galaxy s mean metallicity ( @xmath6 \\rangle = -2.257 $ ] ) are consistent with an ooii classification ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the periods of the single rrl star in each of segue 2 and cvn ii are longer than the ( mean ) rrab period of any other dwarf galaxy .",
    "however , the period of the rrab star in segue 2 and the mean metallicity of the dwarf galaxy are consistent with the strong anti - correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 \\rangle$ ] observed in dwarfs given the significant spread in @xmath7 $ ] confirmed by @xcite .",
    "we can also compare the rrl populations of milky way dwarf galaxy companions using the rrl specific frequency @xmath127 , or the number of rrl stars per system normalized to a system absolute magnitude of @xmath128 : @xmath129 given its one rrl star and an absolute magnitude @xmath0 @xcite , segue 2 has an rrl specific frequency @xmath130 . using the absolute magnitudes provided in @xcite",
    ", we find that this is greater than the specific frequency of any other milky way dwarf galaxy companion considered in table 4 .",
    "these objects have @xmath127 values that range from @xmath131 ( leo i ) to @xmath132 ( comber ) . of the known dwarf companions ,",
    "only segue 1 ( @xmath20 ) , which is known to have at least one rrl star @xcite , appears to have a higher rrl specific frequency .",
    "it is necessary to note that as the completeness of the rrl surveys in these objects is not guaranteed , the specific frequencies of these objects are lower limits . nevertheless , it is interesting to observe that segue 2 may have a high specific frequency compared to most other dwarf galaxy companions in which rrl stars have been discovered .",
    "we calculate the distance to segue 2 using both its newly identified rrl star and its blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars ( with the technique described in  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "as described in  2.3 , we used the @xcite reddening coefficients rather than the sfd98 coefficients for the photometry used to calculate these distances .",
    "for both the rrl and the bhb technique , the updated coefficients make the inferred distance to segue 2 several percent larger than it would have been with the sfd98 coefficients .",
    "using either the rrl star or bhb stars to calculate the distance to segue 2 requires knowledge of the stars metallicities . using the individual metallicities of member stars from @xcite",
    ", we calculate a mean metallicity of @xmath7 = -2.257 \\pm 0.140 $ ] ( as described in  3.1 ) .",
    "the bhb [ fe / h ] value estimated by @xcite is consistent with this value . using the three bhb members and @xmath7 = -2.257 $ ] , we find a distance to segue 2 of @xmath133 kpc .    to calculate the rrl distance",
    ", we first estimate the metallicity of the rrl star using each of the following relationships between rrab metallicity , period , and @xmath3 band amplitude : @xmath134 = -8.85[\\log p_{ab } + 0.15a_{v } ] - 2.60\\ ] ] @xmath134 = -3.43 - 7.82\\log p_{ab}\\ ] ] the former relation , from @xcite , and the latter , from @xcite , have estimated uncertainties of approximately 0.31 and 0.45 dex , respectively . using @xmath4 days and @xmath126 mag ,",
    "we find @xmath7 $ ] values of @xmath135 and @xmath8 dex .",
    "@xcite gives the following relationship between absolute @xmath3 band magnitude and metallicity for rrl stars : @xmath136 + 1.6 ) + ( 0.56 \\pm 0.12)\\ ] ] thus , we derive absolute magnitudes for the rrab star of @xmath137 and @xmath138 for metallicities of @xmath7 = -2.16 $ ] and @xmath7 = -2.44 $ ] , respectively .",
    "therefore , we find a distance to the rrab star of @xmath139 kpc and @xmath140 kpc .",
    "all of our distance measurements individually have @xmath488% uncertainty and are consistent with literature values ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
