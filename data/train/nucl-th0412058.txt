    "<S> two - body bound states such as mesons are described by solutions of the bethe  salpeter equation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss recent results for the pseudoscalar and vector meson masses and leptonic decay constants , ranging from pions up to @xmath0 bound states . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in good agreement with data . </S>",
    "<S> essential in these calculation is a momentum - dependent quark mass function , which evolves from a constituent - quark mass in the infrared region to a current - quark mass in the perturbative region . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the mass spectrum , we review the electromagnetic form factors of the light mesons . electromagnetic current conservation is manifest and the influence of intermediate vector mesons is incorporated self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the pion form factor are in excellent agreement with experiment . </S>"
