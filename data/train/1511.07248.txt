    "these wfns are constructed by iterated function systems ( ifs ) @xcite , whose hausdorff dimension is completely characterized by two main parameters : the number of copies @xmath0 and the scaling factor @xmath1 of the ifs . in this case , the fractal dimension of the fractal weighted network is called the similarity dimension and given by @xcite : @xmath2 to construct  sierpinski \" wfns and  cantor dust \" wfns @xcite , a single node and a triangle is set as a initial network @xmath3 respectively . the first a few steps to construct them",

    "<S> have been proposed in the past a few years , including the sandbox ( sb ) algorithm recently employed by our group . in this paper , a modified sb algorithm ( we call it sbw algorithm ) is proposed for mfa of weighted networks . </S>",
    "<S> first , we use the sbw algorithm to study the multifractal property of two families of weighted fractal networks ( wfns ) :  sierpinski \" wfns and  cantor dust \" wfns . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how the fractal dimension and generalized fractal dimensions change with the edge - weights of the wfn . from the comparison between the theoretical and numerical fractal dimensions of these networks </S>",
    "<S> , we can find that the proposed sbw algorithm is efficient and feasible for mfa of weighted networks . </S>",
    "<S> then , we apply the sbw algorithm to study multifractal properties of some real weighted networks  collaboration networks . </S>",
