    "interfaces play an essential role in phonon - mediated heat conduction in solids.@xcite material discontinuities lead to thermal phonon reflections that are manifested on a macroscopic scale as a thermal boundary resistance ( tbr ) , also called kapitza resistance , @xmath0 , that relates the temperature drop at the interface to the heat flux flowing across it .",
    "tbr exists at the interface between any dissimilar materials due to differences in phonon states on each side of the interface.@xcite typical interfaces often possess defects or roughness which can lead to additional phonon reflections and hence higher tbr .",
    "tbr plays an increasingly important role in applications , particularly as device sizes decrease below the intrinsic mean free paths ( mfps ) of thermal phonons.@xcite at sufficiently small length scales , tbr can dominate the total thermal resistance .",
    "for instance , the effective thermal conductivity of a superlattice can be orders of magnitude smaller than that of the constituent materials due to tbr.@xcite this physical effect has been used to realize thermoelectrics with high efficiency@xcite and dense solids with exceptionally low thermal conductivity@xcite . on the other hand , tbr can lead to significant thermal management problems@xcite in applications such as leds@xcite and high power electronics@xcite .",
    "numerous works over several decades have investigated the microscopic origin of tbr at solid - solid interfaces , starting with studies performed at low temperatures ( @xmath1 k ) , in which heat is carried predominantly by phonons with frequencies less than 1 thz.@xcite at these low temperatures and for pristine , ordered interfaces , transmission coefficients can be obtained from continuum elastic theory in an analogy with snell s law for light ; this model is known as the acoustic mismatch model ( amm).@xcite the amm was shown to explain the experimentally measured values of tbr at various solid - solid interfaces.@xcite at higher temperatures ( above 1 k ) , heat transport across the interfaces was found to be sensitive to surface roughness .",
    "for the limit of completely diffuse scattering in which transmitted and reflected phonons can not be distinguished , swartz constructed the diffuse mismatch model ( dmm).@xcite despite the success of these models at explaining tbr at low temperatures , they generally fail at temperatures larger than 40 k and are unable to account for the atomistic structure of the interface .",
    "recent works have focused on remedying these deficiencies .",
    "optical methods enable the routine measurement of tbr over a wide range of temperatures for various metal - dielectric interfaces @xcite as well as at interfaces with variable bonding strength .",
    "@xcite other works have examined the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity@xcite in nanocrystalline samples .",
    "computational atomistic methods such as molecular dynamics@xcite and atomistic green s functions@xcite have been extensively applied to obtain the transmission coefficients at interfaces with realistic atomic structure .",
    "these calculations generally predict the coefficients to decrease with increasing phonon frequency due to reflections of short wavelength phonons by atomistic roughness , a trend that is supported by basic wave physics and indirectly by experiment.@xcite however , a direct determination of the spectral transmission coefficients at an actual interface has not yet been reported .    here",
    ", we report a metrology to extract the thermal phonon transmission coefficients at a solid interface .",
    "our approach , based on combining experimental observations with ab - initio phonon transport modeling , exploits quasiballistic transport near the interface to significantly narrow the possible transmission coefficient profiles at a solid interface compared to the bounds obtained from traditional approaches . applying our approach in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy ( tem )",
    ", we are able to directly link atomic structure to the spectral content of heat crossing the interface . our approach is a useful tool to elucidate the microscopic transport properties of thermal phonons at solid interfaces .",
    "our approach is based on interpreting data from the tdtr experiment with ab - initio phonon transport model . briefly , tdtr is a widely used optical pump - probe technique that is used to characterize thermal properties . in this experiment ,",
    "a sample consists of a metal transducer film on a substrate .",
    "a pulsed laser beam from an ultrafast oscillator is split into a pump and a probe beam .",
    "the pump pulse train is modulated at a frequency from 1 to 15 mhz to enable lock - in detection , and is then used to impulsively heat the metal film coated on the sample .",
    "the transient temperature decay @xmath2 at the surface is detected as a change in optical reflectance by the probe beam.@xcite    in the traditional tdtr approach , this transient signal is related to the desired thermal properties by a macroscopic transfer function based on a multilayer heat diffusion model.@xcite this function maps thermal properties such as substrate thermal conductivity and metal - substrate interface conductance to the tdtr signal , and thus these properties are obtained by varying these parameters until the simulated results match the measured data sets .",
    "put another way , one must solve an inverse problem that links the data sets to the unknown parameters ; this calculation is often performed using a nonlinear least squares algorithm .",
    "this approach is widely used and has provided important insights into a wide range of metal - semiconductor interfaces * ? ? ?",
    "a drawback , however , is that the microscopic information about the interface is averaged into a single number , the interface conductance , obscuring the microscopic detail .",
    "hopkins et al used tdtr measurements on a variety of metal films with varying phonon cutoff frequencies to extract spectral information about phonon transmission@xcite . however , determining transmission coefficients is still challenging due to variations in phonon density of states in each metal .",
    "in this work , we aim to directly extract the transmission coefficients from tdtr data by replacing the macroscopic transfer function based on fourier s law with a microscopic transfer function based on ab - initio phonon transport modeling . just as in the traditional approach , we seek to identify the parameters that best fit the tdtr data sets .",
    "although this fitting process is much more complex than the traditional approach , in principle it is the same widely - used procedure .",
    "there are several conditions that must be satisfied to successfully extract transmission coefficients using this approach .",
    "first , it is essential that part of the non - equilibrium phonon distribution emerging from the interface propagate into the substrate ballistically . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics ] ( a ) , when mfps are much shorter than the characteristic length scale of the thermal gradient , information about the phonon distribution at the interface is lost due to scattering . in this case",
    ", the tdtr signal is largely insensitive to the transmission coefficient profile so long as the overall interface conductance remains fixed .    on the other hand ,",
    "if some phonons have sufficiently long mfps , the non - equilibrium phonon distribution penetrates into the substrate . in this case , as we will show in subsequent sections , the tdtr signal depends not only on the magnitude of the interface conductance but on the spectral profile of the transmission coefficients .",
    "it is this sensitivity that we will exploit to retrieve the transmission coefficients from the tdtr data sets .",
    "this discussion implies that not every substrate will be suitable for our approach as sufficiently long phonons mfps compared to the induced thermal gradient are required . fortunately",
    ", many experimental reports have demonstrated clear evidence of this quasiballistic heat transport regime in different material systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , mfps in si are generally accepted to exceed one micron at room temperature .",
    "@xcite considering that thermal penetration depths in si are on the same order in tdtr * ? ?",
    "* , si is a suitable substrate for this work .",
    "second , we must determine the microscopic transfer function that maps the transmission coefficients directly to the tdtr signal without any artificial fitting parameters .",
    "this step is challenging due to the difficulty of efficiently solving the bte for the tdtr experiment .",
    "a number of simplified models@xcite have been proposed , but these models make various approximations that limit their predictive capability . in this work ,",
    "we overcome this challenge using two recent advances we reported for rigorously solving the spectral bte under the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) that yield a factor of @xmath3 speedup compared to existing methods and allows the first ab - initio phonon transport modeling of tdtr free of artificial parameters or simplifications of the phonon dispersion .",
    "this solution is derived in the next section .    before deriving the necessary functions",
    ", we briefly summarize the necessary steps in our approach .",
    "first , we obtain tdtr data for a given metal / substrate sample .",
    "we then calculate the intrinsic phonon dispersion and lifetimes for each material that are then inserted into the ab - initio transfer function derived in the next section . finally , the transmission coefficients are varied until the optimized transmission profiles are identified that best match the experimental data .",
    "thus , the procedure is identical to that used in traditional tdtr measurements excepting the complications of deriving and inverting the microscopic transfer function .",
    "we now describe the derivation of the microscopic transfer function @xmath4 that maps transmission coefficients to the tdtr amplitude and phase data as a function of time .",
    "the result of the derivation is a function for which the only inputs are the phonon dispersions and lifetimes for each material composing the interface , and the only unknown parameters are the spectral transmission coefficients @xmath5 .",
    "the output of the function is the tdtr amplitude and phase signal versus delay time . for this work",
    ", the phonon dispersion and lifetimes for si were calculated from first - principles with no adjustable parameters by lucas lindsay .",
    "we have also used first - principles inputs from mingo _",
    "et al_. with no appreciable difference in results or conclusions .",
    "let us first briefly review the signal formation in tdtr . since the thermal response given by the bte is a linear time - invariant system , the output transient signal @xmath2 of tdtr can be represented in terms of frequency response solution through the following equation@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the reference angular frequency of the periodic heating , @xmath8 is the angular sampling frequency set by the repetition rate of the laser pulses , and @xmath9 is surface temperature response subject to a periodic heating at frequency @xmath10 given the transmission coefficients @xmath5 .",

    "we justify the approximations made in the derivation of the transfer function .",
    "first , we have neglected the role of electrons , either in carrying heat in the metal or in carrying heat across the interface by direct coupling to substrate phonons . for the first point , in appendix",
    "[ sec : electrons ] , we solve the bte explicitly including electron - phonon coupling and show that it has negligible effect on the tdtr signal and hence the transmission coefficients .",
    "for the second point , our approach can not rule out this mechanism .",
    "however , the available evidence in the literature @xcite shows that the metal electron - substrate phonon coupling effect is too small to be observed for several material systems .",
    "therefore , little evidence exists to support a large contribution from this mechanism . as a result",
    ", we assume that heat is carried across the interface solely by phonons .",
    "the second assumption is the neglect of mode conversion , or the change of phonon polarization as phonons transmit or reflect at the interface . in appendix",
    "[ sec : modeconversion ] , we explicitly calculate the transfer function including this mechanism , showing that it has very little impact on the results . therefore",

    "now consider the number of unknowns . if we take the materials to be isotropic , the transmission coefficients depend only on phonon frequency . in our typical discretization",

    "therefore , the number of unknowns is comparable to the number of data points .",
    "ample data points are a necessary but not sufficient condition to enable extraction of transmission coefficients .",
    "the last requirement is that the tdtr signal should be sensitive to the shape of the transmission coefficient profile . in the case of heat diffusion ,",

    "this result confirms that the measured transmission coefficients for si and sige substrates are indeed the same .    interpreting the tdtr data on the sige with the conventional model results in a number of physical inconsistencies that are eliminated with our approach .",

    "this inconsistency is removed when interpreting the data with our microscopic model as the same transmission coefficients explain both data sets .",
    "finally , we examine how the atomic structure of the interface affects the spectral content of the phonons carrying heat across the interface .",

    "fig : tem_oxide_nativeoxide ] ( e ) & ( f ) . compared to a clean interface",
    ", the transmission coefficients for al on si with a native oxide are reduced for most of the phonon modes , except those with long wavelength longer than 1 nm . when the roughness of the interface increases with a thicker oxide layer , the transmission coefficient keeps decreasing and more phonons , especially those with wavelengths between 1 and 3 nm , are reflected at the interface .",
    "therefore , our measurements show that phonons with wavelength shorter than the interface roughness are more likely to be reflected by the interface than phonons with wavelength longer than the interface roughness , and as the interface gets rougher , a larger fraction of the phonon spectrum is affected by the interface .",

    "for example , the apparently correct measurement of silicon thermal conductivity is a coincidence that occurs due to the transmission coefficient profile of a typical al / si interface . as recently showed by wilson et al , if the interface is modified by the introduction of an oxide layer , the measured thermal conductivity no longer coincides with the literature value .",
    "@xcite similarly , the traditional fitting approach yields a thermal conductivity for sige that does not agree with its actual value measured with a bulk method .",
    "these inconsistencies are eliminated if the data are interpreted with our approach .",
    "therefore , the conventional tdtr interpretation does not necessarily provide the actual physical properties of materials .",
    "second , our measurements show that the spectral profile of transmission coefficients is essential to understanding thermal transport across interfaces . due to a lack of knowledge about interfaces , the phonon transmission coefficients",
    "are often predicted with a variety of simple models .",

    "our microscopic transfer function does not incorporate electrons or inelastic scattering yet is able to explain all of the measurements we performed .",
    "this observation shows that the consideration of inelastic transmission and coupling between electrons in metals and phonons in semiconductors is not necessary to explain the tdtr data sets .",
    "fourth , our results provide quantitative information into which phonons transmit across interfaces of a given atomic structure . in particular , the strong frequency dependence of the transmission coefficients can be exploited to create thermal phonon filters to selectively remove parts of phonon spectrum , analogous to optical long - pass filters .",
    "phonons with wavelength much longer than the characteristic roughness of an interface are more likely transmitted through the interface while short - wavelength phonons are mostly reflected .",
    "our approach provides a means to determine which of these phonon modes are transmitted or reflected and thus identify which phonon modes are filtered by the interface .",

    "after the first 100 ps , the heat conduction is dominated by the phonons . since a typical signal in a tdtr experiment",
    "is usually measured after 500 ps , whether heat is attributed to phonons or electrons in the metal has a negligible effect on the signal on the timescales that is interested in the experiments .",
    "therefore , our neglect of electrons has no effect on our transmission coefficient measurement .",
    "when phonons cross an interface they can change their frequency , in an inelastic process , or polarization , known as mode conversion , which can influence thermal interface conductance.@xcite in our work , we do not consider inelastic scattering .",

    "we have carefully examined the effect of mode conversion on our conclusions by rigorously including this process in our bte model .",
    "to examine whether conversion between polarizations would affect the phonon transport across the interface , we conducted our bte simulation assuming modes maintain their polarization after crossing the interface , or allowing them to change to any polarization while keeping the total transmission coefficient the same",

    "[ fig : modeconversionjustification ] , we show that the surface temperature decay with and without conversion between polarization are essentially identical .",
    "moreover , the spectral interfacial heat flux is also identical with and without conversion .",
    "therefore , we conclude that mode conversion does not have an observable effect on the signal .    the reason that our measurement is not sensitive",
    "to mode conversion is that the polarizations in si do not have extremely dissimilar mean free paths .",
    "as our measurement approach relies on the lack of scattering of some modes near the interface , the only way the mode conversion could affect our measurements would be if one polarization consistently changed to another polarization after transmitting through the interface with a drastically different mean free path than the original polarization .",
    "our calculations clearly show that the difference in mean free paths between the polarizations is not sufficient to affect our calculations and hence have any effect on our conclusions .",

    "<S> interfaces play an essential role in phonon - mediated heat conduction in solids , impacting applications ranging from thermoelectric waste heat recovery to heat dissipation in electronics . from the microscopic perspective </S>",
    "<S> , interfacial phonon transport is described by transmission coefficients that link vibrational modes in the materials composing the interface . </S>",
    "<S> however , direct experimental determination of these coefficients is challenging because most experiments provide a mode - averaged interface conductance that obscures the microscopic detail . here , we report a metrology to extract thermal phonon transmission coefficients at solid interfaces using ab - initio phonon transport modeling and a thermal characterization technique , time - domain thermoreflectance . in combination with transmission electron microscopy characterization of the interface , our approach allows us to link the atomic structure of an interface to the spectral content of the heat crossing it . </S>",
    "<S> our work provides a useful perspective on the microscopic processes governing interfacial heat conduction . </S>"
