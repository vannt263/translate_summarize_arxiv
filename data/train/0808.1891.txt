    "the magnetic aharonov - bohm effect  @xcite results when a charged particle travels around a closed path in a region of vanishing magnetic field but nonvanishing vector potential .",
    "the magnetic flux is confined to a region where the particle is excluded , but the wave function of the particle is nonetheless affected by the vector potential and an interference pattern occurs at a detection screen .     a plane projection of the standard magnetic aharonov - bohm effect apparatus .",
    "the electrons travel along semiclassical paths @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the source @xmath2 to the detection screen @xmath3 .",
    "the electrons do not penetrate the interior of the solenoid which carries the flux @xmath4.,width=283 ]    let @xmath5 be the center line of a magnetic solenoid with the enclosed flux @xmath4 and the vector potential @xmath6 . for an electron moving along a semiclassical path @xmath7 , the wave function is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . for a standard magnetic aharonov - bohm effect apparatus in fig .",
    "[ figure - ab - apparatus ] , the total amplitude for paths @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath10 .",
    "the quantity @xmath11 is an overall irrelevant phase and the quantity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , measures the relative phase shift between paths @xmath0 and @xmath1 . applying the stokes theorem",
    ", we find @xmath14 .",
    "there is a certain duality in this picture .",
    "namely , if we take @xmath7 to be the center line of a solenoid with the magnetic flux @xmath15 and @xmath5 a path of an electron , then the phase shift is @xmath16 .",
    "( we close the path @xmath5 far away from the apparatus , e.g. , at infinity . )",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the ratio of the phase to the flux is proportional to the gaussian linking of the curves @xmath7 and @xmath5 , which is symmetric with respect to the curves .",
    "we will later use this duality in the more complicated case of knotted curves .",
    "the phase @xmath17 is of course gauge invariant . for explicit computations , however , it is convenient to choose a singular gauge  @xcite in which @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 is a connected and orientable surface for which the curve @xmath5 is the boundary , @xmath20 is the delta function with the support on @xmath19 , and @xmath21 is the unit vector normal to @xmath19 .",
    "( for an infinite solenoid , @xmath19 is the half plane . for a toroidal solenoid , @xmath19 is a disk . )",
    "it is clear that each time a closed path @xmath7 intersects the surface @xmath19 , the quantity @xmath22 increases or decreases by the quantity @xmath4 depending on whether the intersection of @xmath7 and @xmath19 is positive or negative .",
    "thus , for an arbitrary path @xmath7 , the phase is @xmath23 , where the integer @xmath24 is the signed number of times @xmath7 intersects @xmath19 . in the dual picture , we consider a connected and orientable surface @xmath25 for which the curve @xmath7 is the boundary , choose the gauge potential @xmath26 , and obtain @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the signed number of times @xmath5 intersects @xmath25 .",
    "a crucial observation is that the two intersection numbers are equal , @xmath29 .    for a fixed closed curve @xmath5",
    ", any possible path of an electron belongs to @xmath30 , the complement of @xmath5 in @xmath31 .",
    "the set of all such paths form a group @xmath32 under the operation of multiplication of paths .",
    "this group is @xmath33 , the first homotopy group  @xcite of @xmath34 , also called the fundamental group of @xmath34 .",
    "topologically , @xmath5 bounds a disk .",
    "if we continuously deform this disk , the signed intersection number does not change .",
    "this can be seen by noting that during deformations of @xmath19 , new intersection points of @xmath7 and @xmath19 appear in pairs , and the two points in each pair have intersections of opposite signs .",
    "this means that @xmath24 depends only on the topological class to which @xmath35 belongs .",
    "it follows from the above that @xmath36 . in the dual picture , we need @xmath37 , the fundamental group of the complement of @xmath7 , and it similarly follows that @xmath38 . in the next section",
    "we will generalize these ideas to orientable surfaces which are bounded by knots .",
    "the above example has a simple topology , which resulted in abelian groups @xmath32 and @xmath39 .",
    "the aharonov - bohm analysis can be extended to examples of more complicated topologies .",
    "one possibility is to consider multiple magnetic solenoids , which might be unlinked or linked with each other .",
    "we have studied this case in refs .",
    "@xcite , where we showed that the phase is proportional to the product of fluxes from different solenoids and depends on linking numbers of higher orders .",
    "our purpose here is to consider a simpler case of one self - knotted closed solenoid .",
    "we now consider the case of a closed self - knotted curve @xmath5 .",
    "for each such @xmath5 , there are surfaces which are bounded by @xmath5 .",
    "if such a surface is connected and orientable , then it is called a seifert surface of @xmath5 . a well - known theorem  @xcite states that there is a seifert surface for every knot .",
    "( note that some knots also bound non - orientable surfaces ; for example , there is a mobius strip with a @xmath40 twist which is bounded by the trefoil knot .",
    "this is not a seifert surface , and we will have no use for such non - orientable surfaces here . ) in general , for a given @xmath5 , there can be more than one nonequivalent seifert surface  @xcite .",
    "however , the signed number of intersections of a closed curve @xmath7 and @xmath19 is independent of the choice of @xmath19 . hence our results will be independent of the choice of a seifert surface .",

    "one of the simplest classes of nontrivial knots is the torus knots @xmath96 .",
    "the torus knot @xmath97 wraps around the solid torus in the longitudinal direction @xmath98 times and in the meridional direction @xmath99 times .",
