    "quantum degenerate gases of bosonic and/or fermionic atoms have proven very useful tools in the exploration of low - temperature many - body quantum physics . in this area of research , the initial bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) or",
    "degenerate fermi gas ( dfg ) serves primarily as a well - defined starting point for the generation of more exotic highly - correlated and/or entangled many - body states .",
    "the most profound recent experimental demonstrations of this approach include the observations of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition in an optical lattice and the cross - over to a ` fermionized ' tonks - girardeau under quasi - one - dimensional confinement .",
    "in addition , there has been significant progress towards observing the bec to bcs cross - over in a two - component gas of fermionic atoms @xcite , and efforts are underway to observe the cross - over from a vortex - lattice to a non - trivial entangled many - body state in the ground - state of a rapidly rotating bec @xcite .    in the first of the aforementioned experiments , a reversible change from a superfluid to a mott - insulator state was observed when crossing from tunneling - dominated to the collision - dominated regime for atoms trapped in a lattice potential with repulsive atom - atom interactions .",
    "the analogous transition for the case of attractive interactions involves the crossover from a superfluid into a state often described as a ` schrdinger cat state ' where the atomic population collapses into a single lattice site , with the true ground state being a symmetric superposition over all possible lattice sites as the final occupied site .",
    "in addition to providing fundamental insights into the nature of the transition from the quantum to the classical descriptions of reality , such states may have important applications in precision measurement @xcite and quantum information processing .    in this paper",
    "we investigate theoretically the possibility to use a bec trapped in a double - well potiential to generate highly - entangled schrdinger cat - type state , which can be viewed as a realization of the two - site bose - hubbard model with attractive interactions .",
    "we address important issues such as detection of cat - like states and the effects of photon - scattering induced decoherence which occurs when far - off - resonant laser - light is used for trapping and/or probing the cat states .",
    "interest in schrdinger cat - like states , loosely defined as quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable many - body states , goes back to the earliest days of quantum mechanics .",
    "in 1935 , in oder to demonstrate the limitations inherent in using quantum mechanics to describe everyday phenomena , erwin schrodinger proposed a experiment in the macroscopic state of a cat is entangled with that of an unstable nuclei , allowing the cat to enter a coherent superposition of being dead and alive @xcite .",
    "such states were thought at the time to be logically untenable , although today we might consider only that they would not be observed due to rapid environmentally - induced decoherence @xcite . to this day , this famous gedanken experiment illustrates the fundamental difficulties inherent postulating a well - defined boundary between a classical level of reality and an underlying level governed by quantum mechanics , one of the fundamental open questions in quantum theory .",
    "many of the early gedanken experiments , whose consideration led to the earliest understanding of quantum mechanics , are now being transformed into laboratory realities .",
    "one such effort has been the ongoing quest for schrdinger - cat - like states , with the most striking experimental results to date being the observation of a superposition between clock - wise and counter - clock - wise currents in a superconducting quantum interference device @xcite and the observation of double - slit diffraction for massive @xmath0 molecules @xcite .",
    "additional efforts include work in trapped ions at low temperature @xcite , nanoscale magnets@xcite , and superconductors @xcite .",
    "this progress is generating deeper insight into the meaning of quantum theory , as well as potential applications in the fields of precision measurement and quantum information processing .",
    "even with the current rapid rate of progress , the quest to obtain and utilize large cat - like states remains a serious experimental challenge , due primarily to the presumed scaling of fragility ( with respect to environmentally - induced decoherence ) with number of particles .",
    "for most appliciations , the utility of the cat - state increases with particle number @xcite , so there is a strong need to find systems in which such maximally - entangled states of large numbers of particles can be generated without rapid collapse due to decoherence .",
    "an atomic bec @xcite may be such a system , as its large degree of spatial and temporal coherence is well established by experiment @xcite .",
    "the bimodal bec , which is constructed by isolating a pair of weakly - coupled atomic - field modes , is one of the simplest quantum systems used in the study of entanglement physics and has therefore been the subject of extensive theoretical study @xcite . in this system ,",
    "@xmath1 bosons are restricted to occupy one of two modes , and entanglement is established via 2-body interactions between the bosons . for the case of an atomic bec , the two modes can either be two potential - wells spatially separated by a potential barrier ( so - called double - well bec s ) @xcite or two spatially - overlapping modes in different hyperfine states @xcite .",
    "in addition , a recent paper proposes an analogous system in which a double - well ` potential ' in momentum - space , formed from the band - structure in a lattice potential , can be used to create cat - states involving two momentum - states @xcite .",
    "the quantum ground - state of the bosonic double - well system has been studied for the case of repulsive interactions in the context of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition @xcite , as well as for the case of attractive interactions . for the latter ,",
    "it has been shown under certain conditions a schdinger cat - like macroscopic superposition state , can be generated@xcite . in this cat - like many - body state ,",
    "a large number of atoms are collectively either in one mode or in another .",
    "the dynamics of the bimodal system have also been investigated , both via a meanfield approach and a full many - body treatment within the two - mode approximation . in the mean - field treatment , the dynamic evolution",
    "is treated as a bose josephson junction , which is complementary to that of a superconductor tunnel junction @xcite .",
    "this treatment predicts a degenerate ground - state , corresponding to all amplitude in one well or the other , but is not capable of predicting the dynamical evolution of cat - like states , as these states lie outside of the domain of mean - field theory . in the two - mode many - body treatment , the many - particle cat - like state is predicted to arise during the dynamical evolution of an initial minimally - entangled condensate state in the presence of repulsive interactions @xcite , but with the sign of the tunneling coefficient reversed by imprinting a @xmath2-phase shift onto one well . in this paper",
    ", we propose that such cat states can be realized for the case of an atomic bec trapped in a double - well potential by employing a magnetic feshbach resonance to tune the atomic interaction from repulsive to attractive @xcite .",
    "it is found that for suitable parameters , the initial state will evolve into a cat - like state after a certain period of time , and then it will revive back to the initial state .    despite these theoretical advances ,",
    "there remain many challenges , some of which we address in the present manuscript .",
    "one challenge is the problem of experimental verification of the coherence between macroscopically distinguishable states , which is related to the challenge of understanding the role played by environmentally - induced decoherence in collapsing the cat - state onto a statistical mixture of the two macroscopically - distinguishable possibilities . in this paper",
    "we focus in detail on the decoherence which will occur if laser - light is used for trapping and/or probing of the cat states .",
    "in addition the influence of atom - atom interactions on the proposed detection scheme is studied in some detail . as suggested in @xcite",
    ", we show the revival of the initial state can be used as an unambiguous signal that the supposed cat - state is indeed a coherent macroscopic superposition , as opposed to an incoherent mixture .",
    "we also demonstrate , however , that collisional de - phasing can mask the revival without a true loss of coherence .",
    "the effects of decoherence on these cat - like states have primarily been discussed for the case of coupling to the thermal - cloud of non - condensate atoms .",
    "there is disagreement in the literature regarding whether or not this effect is significant @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that these authors treat the non - condensate fraction as a markovian reservoir , which implies an infinitely - short memory ( relative to condensate evolution times ) for correlations between the condensate and non - condensate terms .",
    "we question this assumption , primarily due to the fact that the non - condensate fraction typically has a very low temperature and density .",
    "in addition , the non - condensate atoms are trapped inside the condensate volume by the trapping potential , thus there is no irreversible loss of information due to propagation of the entangled atoms outside of the system volume .",
    "hence , we suspect that a non - markovian treatment is necessary to accurately evaluate the thermal - cloud induced decoherence . however , modeling this is a difficult task that we do not address at present .",
    "instead , we assume that this effect is negligible and concentrate primarily on an analysis of a new source of decoherence : that due to spontaneous scattering of far - off - resonant photons from laser fields which we presume are used in either the trapping and/or probing of the system . in this case",
    ", the correlation time of the reservoir is governed by the irreversible loss of the scattered photons from the system volume at the extremely fast rate of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the atomic mode size and @xmath5 is the speed of light . hence",
    ", the markov approximation works extremely well for describing the physics of photon - scattering .",
    "as is well known , this approach leads to effective interactions as well as decoherence , effects which include induced dipole - dipole interactions and collective spontaneous emission ( superradiance ) in the atomic ensemble .    when analyzing the effects of environmentally - induced decoherence we are interested in answering two basic questions : ( 1 ) what limitations are imposed on the ability to create cat - states , and revive the initial condensate states by the presence of decoherence , and ( 2 ) how long can one ` hold ' the cat - state by decreasing the tunnel - coupling to zero , without collapse of the cat - state onto a mixed state .",
    "the second question is raised in anticipation of applications in precision measurement and quantum information processing where the cat state is operated on and/or held ready for future operations during a complicated protocol .",
    "we therefore need to determine the lifetime of the cat states in the presence of decoherence , as well as the effect of decoherence on the dynamical evolution from the initial state into the cat - state .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section [ model ] , the model of bimodal bec in double - well system is introduced and the cat states in such a system are defined ; in section [ generation ] , two schemes of creating cat state are discussed : adiabatic evolution of the ground - state and and dynamical evolution of a non - stationary state .",
    "we demonstrate that the former is experimental unfeasible due to the fact that the end state is nearly degenerate with the first - excited state .",
    "we then propose generating a cat - like state through dynamic evolution following a sudden flipping of the sign of the atomic interaction , accomplished via feshbach resonance . in section",
    "[ detection ] , the method of detecting the cat - state via revival of the initial state is discussed in detail . in section [ decoherence ]",
    "we investigate the decoherence of cat - states and a master equation is derived for laser - induced decoherence .",
    "in addition , the lifetime of cat - states in the presence of laser fields is determined . in section [ dephasing ] ,",
    "the dephasing effects due to the nonlinear two - body interaction is studied . and finally , we briefly summarize our results in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "our proposed scheme involves loading a bec into a double - well potential and then employing a feschbach resonance to vary the atomic scattering length in order to produce a schrdinger cat - like state . for present",
    "we consider only the case of a spatial double - well potential .",
    "however , an analogous system can be formed by using a raman - scheme to couple two hyperfine states in a spinor bec .",
    "the primary difference between this model and the double - well system lies in the presence of collisional interactions between the two modes , due to the spatial overlap of the hyperfine modes .",
    "our current model neglects these collisions , as they are negligible for the case of well - separated potential minima .",
    "most of our results should apply to both systems , however , the effects of inter - mode collisions will be considered in future work .",
    "we begin our analysis from the usual many - body hamitonian describing atomic bec , @xmath6\\hat{\\psi}({{\\bf r}})\\nonumber\\\\      & + & \\frac{u_0}{2}\\int d^3r\\ , \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}({{\\bf r}})\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}({{\\bf r}})\\hat{\\psi}({{\\bf r}})\\hat{\\psi}({{\\bf r}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the atomic mass , @xmath8 is the trapping potential and @xmath9 is the annihilate field operator for atoms in heisenberg picture .",
    "the two - body interaction strength is given by @xmath10 , with @xmath11 denoting the @xmath12wave scattering length . in our model ,",
    "the bec is assumed to occupy a symmetric double - well potential .",
    "the single - atom ground state and first excited state this system we denote as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , where @xmath13 is symmetric with respect to the double - well symmetry and @xmath14 is antisymmetric .",
    "we denote the energy gap between these states as @xmath15 , which is typically much smaller than the gap between the first and second excited states . because of this gap",
    ", we assume throughout that the atomic population is restricted to these two modes alone .",
    "it is convenient to introduce two localized states @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "inserting this expansion back into the many - body hamiltonian ( [ many - body ] ) , one recovers the two - mode version of bose - hubbard model @xmath23 in deriving this expression , we have implicitly assumed that atomic collisions in the overlapping region of the two modes are negilibile , valid under the assumption that the two modes are well separated .",
    "the intra - well two - body interaction strength is indicated by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "note that in the deriving of the bimodal hamiltonian ( [ bose - hubbard ] ) , the wavefunction for each mode is assumed to be independent of particle number in the trap , and terms proportional to the total atom number - operator have been dropped , as atom number is assumed to be a conserved quantity .",
    "the quantum state of this bimodal system can be expessed as a superposition of fock - states @xmath26",
    "@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 here , @xmath1 is the total number of atoms in condensate which for convenience we take as a even number , and @xmath29 denotes half number difference between the two modes .",
    "the two corresponding operators are @xmath30 in this representation , the conventional schrdinger cat state is defined as @xmath31 where the @xmath1 particles have equal probability to be all in the left or all in the right mode .",
    "this cat - state is an ideal maximally - entangled state , however it will be difficult to create such a state in this bimodal system . instead , a more experimental accessible cat - like state is one containing two - well - separated wave - packets in the distribution of @xmath32 .",
    "for example , a typical cat - like state can be of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 .    in the present bimodal system",
    "the class of cat - like states is more general than the gaussian form ( [ cat - gaussian ] ) .",
    "instead , a useful cat like state only need to satisfy two conditions : ( i ) the probability distribution in fock - space should be approximately symmetric ; and ( ii ) the two wave - packets should be well separated in order to correspond to macroscopically distinguishable states . in the present model ,",
    "condition ( i ) is satisfied provided the initial state is symmetric , due to the symmetry of hamiltonian ( [ bose - hubbard ] ) .",
    "as we will see is section [ decoherence ] , decoherence may break this symmetry .",
    "nonetheless , to distinguish cat - like states from non - cat state , it is convenient to introduce a projection operator @xmath35 @xmath36 this operator acts as a filter which picks up cat - states with a minimum wave - packet separation of @xmath37 . and",
    "the expectation value @xmath38 can be a efficient way to determine whether a state is cat - like .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for a cat - like state we will have @xmath39 , whereas for a non - cat state the trace will be noticeably less than unity .",
    "as shown both theoretically and experimentally , the @xmath40-wave scattering length of cold atoms can be modulated by applying a varied magnetic field . in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance",
    ", it takes the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the background value , @xmath43 is the resonant value of the magnetic field , and @xmath44 is the width of the resonance . by tuning the magnetic field @xmath45 ,",
    "the scattering length @xmath11 can be efficiently tuned in an adequate range based on the feshbach resonance , as demonstrated in recent experiments .",
    "thus , the two body interaction term @xmath46 in hamiltonian ( [ bose - hubbard ] ) , which is determined by scattering length @xmath11 , is implicitly assumed to be an arbitrary adjustable number .    before discussing the methods of generating cat - states",
    ", we note that attractive bec s can collapse due to instability , as been demonstrated in experiments @xcite .",
    "a trapped bec , however , can be stable against collapse under the condition of low atomic density @xcite . in terms of the bec atom number @xmath1 , the attractive interaction strength @xmath46 and the energy gap between the first - excited state and ground state @xmath47",
    ", the stability condition can be written as @xmath48 in the present discussion one can increase the energy gap between the ground and excited state by adjusting the trapping potential , and in this way , we can ensure our system will not collapse when the sign of the scattering length is switched from positive to negative .      in this subsection",
    ", we begin by briefly discussing the possibility to create cat - states via adiabatic manipulation of the many - body ground state @xcite , achieved by a continuous variation of the interaction strength @xmath46 from a positive to a negative value . in order to better understand the adiabatic evolution of the ground state",
    ", we first examine the ground state under certain parameter values for which it can be determined exactly .",
    "the first case we consider is that of zero tunneling , in which case the bimodal hamiltonian ( [ bose - hubbard ] ) can be reduced to @xmath49 the ground state of this hamiltonian is determined solely by the parameter @xmath24 . for @xmath50 ,",
    "corresponding to repulsive interactions , the ground state will be @xmath51 in our number - difference representation ( [ n ] ) , i.e. , an insulator state . while in the case of @xmath52 , the ground state is doubly degenerate , corresponding to any arbitrary superposition of the two extreme states @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and its orthogonal counterpart .",
    "these states can be written as @xmath55 with @xmath56 being arbitrary complex numbers .",
    "note when @xmath57 , one recovers the shrdinger cat state ( [ cat - define ] ) .    in the other extreme case ,",
    "if there is no atomic interaction but only the tunneling term , the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ bose - hubbard ] ) becomes the two - site analogue of the superfluid phase @xcite @xmath58 which is a binomial distribution of fock states , and thus approximately gaussian when @xmath1 is a large number .",
    "henceforth we shall refer to this class of states as a ` coherent state ' , meaning that each atom is in a coherent superposition of both modes and there are no atom - atom correlations or many - body entanglement .",
    "the more general ground state of our model , with the presence of both collisions and tunneling , can be understood as a smooth cross - over between these two extremes .",
    "first , under the condition of a repulsive atomic interaction , the ground states of this system can be well approximated by a single gaussian - like distribution of @xmath32 peaked at @xmath59 @xmath60 where the relative atom number dispersion @xmath61 is obtained by minimizing by the mean - energy of hamiltonian .",
    "second , under the condition of attractive two - body interaction , the ground state of this system will be split into two separated wave - packets .",
    "thus instead of ( [ eqn - guass ] ) , a good approximation of this state turns out to be a superposition of two gaussian distributions ( [ cat - gaussian ] ) @xcite , where again the minima center @xmath62 and spread width @xmath61 are obtained by minimizing the mean - energy . for repulsive atomic interactions ,",
    "the energy minima is found at @xmath63 , which indicates that the atom number distribution does not split .",
    "for attractive interactions , @xmath64 , and under the condition of @xmath34 , the wavepacket of ground state will split and become a superposition of two well - separated components , i.e. it becomes a cat - like state ( [ cat - gaussian ] ) .",
    "note for this state , the relative phase for any fock basis pair @xmath26 and @xmath65 is zero .",
    "based on these considerations , it is of theoretical interest to determine whether or not the shrdinger cat state in this bimodal bec system can be generated by an adiabatic process @xcite . as a basic scheme ,",
    "the system would be first prepared in the many - body ground state with positive @xmath46 , corresponding to a coherent state centered at @xmath59 .",
    "then by slowly tuning @xmath46 to be negative , the distribution will split and finally end up with a shrdinger cat like state under the condition of @xmath34 .",
    "there is a significant difficulty with this proposal , however , in that when the two wavepackets in fock space are well separated , the ground state , which is the desired cat state , is nearly degenerate with the first excited state , as shown in fig.([degenerate ] ) .",
    "it is observed that when @xmath46 is positive , there is a relatively large energy gap between the ground and first excited states .",
    "then as @xmath46 decreases , the energy gap decreases so that at some point the energy gap becomes exponentially small . in fig .",
    "[ degwf ] , we show the corresponding wavefunctions of the ground and first excited states @xmath66 with different ratios @xmath67 .",
    "it is clear that the ground state does not evolve into cat state until the bimodal system enters the degenerate regime . in the degenerate regime ,",
    "any small perturbation can mix the two states .",
    "as the first excited state is nearly identical with the ground state , but with a @xmath2 phase - shift between the left and right wave - packets , an arbitrary superposition of these two states could easily correspond to a localized state , which is equivalent to a collapse of the schrdinger cat wavefunction .",
    "strictly speaking , this degeneracy implies that to adiabatically create the cat state , the process requires an exponentially long time .",
    "thus experimental realization appears impractical , particularly when considering the inevitable exposure of the system to noise .    .    .",
    "an alternate approach to a schrdinger cat state , based on dynamical evolution , has been studied for some time @xcite . in this subestion",
    ", we show that it is feasible to dynamically create the cat state from a coherent state by using a feshbach resonance to make a sudden change in the scattering length .",
    "our proposed scheme is as follows .",
    "first , our system is prepared in the ground state with repulsive interactions and strong tunnelling between wells .",
    "the could be accomplished , e.g. by preparing a bec in a single well , and then adiabatically raising a barrier to divide the well into two equal parts .",
    "note here , the quantum state of this system is coherent in the sense that each atom in the condensate is independently in a superposition of the two localized states .",
    "the interaction parameters in this initial stage are chosen to satisfy @xmath68 as this will lead to the optimal cat - like state attainable in this scheme @xcite .",
    "once this state is established , the feshbach resonance is used to achieve a sudden switch of the sign of the scattering length , i.e. we go from @xmath68 to @xmath69 . in order to avoid the collapse of the condensate",
    "when scattering length @xmath11 becomes negative , the amplitude of atomic interaction @xmath46 should be small . at this point , with tunneling still on , the initial state is no longer an eigenstate , thus it will start a dynamic evolution under the new hamilton .    the evolution of the initial coherent state after the change in the sign of @xmath46 is shown in figure [ formation - cat ] .",
    "it is seen that cat - like states are formed periodically , and between two consequent cat states the system approximately revives back to the initial coherent state .",
    "we have determined that the best cat state appears at time @xmath70 , which corresponds to the final state shown in fig .",
    "[ formation - cat ] .",
    "once the cat state is formed , one needs to freeze the dynamic evolution at a time when the system is in the cat state .",
    "this can be accomplished by suddenly rising the barrier between the two modes to reduce the tunneling coeffient , @xmath71 , to zero .",
    "since the present proposal is based on a dynamic procedure , predicting the time when the cat state is produced @xmath72 is of critical importance . due to the imposed constraint @xmath73 , which is necessary to obtain an optimal cat - state",
    ", @xmath72 can be expressed solely in terms of the tunneling rate @xmath71 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is determined from our simulations to be @xmath76 .    in figure",
    "[ projection ] , we show the dynamics evolution of projection operator @xmath77 . again , it is shown that the optimum cat - like state forms at around @xmath78 and reappears again at intervals of @xmath79 .",
    "it is also noticed that between each cat state , there are valleys of @xmath77 , which correspond to revivals of the initial coherent state .    .    .",
    "it is also of interest to study the relative phases between the fock states in the cat - like state generated in this manner .",
    "the symmetry between left and right modes is automatically guaranteed in our model since our system hamiltonian ( [ bose - hubbard ] ) and our initial state are both symmetric . in figure",
    "[ phase - cat ] , we see that the phase of created cat state is exactly symmetric around @xmath59 . in addition , we see that the phase flattens somewhat in the vicinity of @xmath80 , where the peaks in the probability are located .    .",
    "we have claimed that imposing the condition @xmath81 is necessary to produce the optimal cat state .",
    "it is worth pointing out that with other choices , left - right symmetric states can be created , but these are neither well - separated nor double peaked .",
    "this is shown in figure [ projection - measure ] , where we plot the expectation value of the projector @xmath77 versus @xmath82 , where we have taken @xmath83 . in this figure",
    ", we see the cat - like state is only created in the vicinity of @xmath84 with an uncertainty of approximately @xmath85 .",
    "that means to create a cat state in the present system , a precise control of the atomic interaction @xmath46 or tunneling rate @xmath71 is required .",
    "it is important to note that in generating figure [ projection - measure ] we have varied the evolution time @xmath72 for each parameter choice , in order to maximize the projection @xmath77 .",
    "thus figure [ projection - measure ] can be interpreted as verifying the conditions @xmath68 and @xmath86 .    .    up to now",
    "we have only considered the ideal situation where the initial state is exactly prepared in the ground state and the atomic scattering length can be tuned in a precise way .",
    "this may not necessarily hold true under experimental conditions , where random fluctuations in system parameters may affect the formation of the cat - state . here , to test the susceptability of the present proposal to such fluctuations , we study the dependence of final cat - state on the precision of the initial state by adding random noise to the exact ground state .",
    "thus , the initial state becomes @xmath87 .",
    "the random noise , @xmath88 , is a complex with an amplitude drawn from a gaussian distribution , and a completely random phase .",
    "the probability distributions for the amplitude and phase are therefore @xmath89 figure [ stability - cat ] shows the resulting cat - state as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "we see that a well peaked cat state can be produced up to @xmath91 , which is about @xmath92 , i.e , the peak of initial coherent state we make the cat state from .",
    "thus this method of generating a cat state appears robust against noise in the initial state , which could be do to a finite temperature .    .",
    "another possible source of error in creating the cat state is from the inaccuracy in control of the atomic interaction strength @xmath46 and/or the tunneling rate @xmath71 .",
    "this effect is simulated by adding a gaussian - distributed random number to negative @xmath46 .",
    "we note that this is not equivalent to time - dependent fluctuations in @xmath46 and @xmath71 , but rather represents imprecision in the control over the values of the parameters .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ randomg ] , where it is seen that the evolution system is sensitive to the noise of the atomic interaction @xmath46 , with only about @xmath93 deviation being tolerable .",
    "however , it does not necessarily mean that one can not create a cat - state without the well defined @xmath46 . instead ,",
    "when @xmath46 is shifted , the time need to create cat state @xmath72 is also shifted , and one can still obtain the cat - state on another time .",
    "the primary difficulty here is that if the variation in @xmath46 is unknown for a given run , then the precise time to stop the dynamics , @xmath72 is not known a - priori .    .",
    "presuming a cat - like state can be created in the above manner , it remains a challenge to experimentally verify the coherence between the macroscopically distinguishable states .",
    "neverthless , a possible method to detect schrdinger cat states in this bimodal bec s lies in detecting the revival of the initial coherent state . in fig .",
    "[ revival - cat ] we show the evolution of the cat state starting from @xmath94 with the system parameters still satisfying @xmath68 .",
    "this shows that under the condition of no decoherence , the system will evolve back to a coherent state after a certain period of time , which we denote as @xmath95 . the revival time @xmath95 again is estimated from our simulations , yielding @xmath96 .    in the presence of decoherence , however , the system may not be exhibit a distinct revival of the coherent state . to illustrate this we first consider two states which we define as the partially incoherent state and the totally incoherent state .",

    "in other words the system collapses onto an incoherence mixture of the state with one atom lost from mode l and the state with one atom lost from mode r.    as an example , we now consider a @xmath1 particle cat state of @xmath270 and to distinguish cat states with different total atom numbers , here we use a new notation @xmath271 where @xmath272 stands for a fock basis with @xmath192 atoms in left mode and @xmath217 in the right .",
    "this cat state is collapsed after one photon - detection into a statistical mixture of two @xmath257 particle states , @xmath273 where @xmath274 the important point here is that each of these states is still a good cat - like state , so that while we do nt know which one the system has collapsed into , we do know that the system remains in a good cat - like state .",
    "the means that the effect of scattering a photon and losing an atom may not have a significant detrimental effect on cat - like states .",
    "similarly , after a second photon is scattered , the system will collapse into a statistical mixture of four @xmath275 particle cat states , and so on .",
    "we note , however , that for the perfect cat state @xmath276/\\sqrt{2}$ ] a single scattering results in a mixture of the states @xmath277 and @xmath278 , neither of which is itself a cat - state .",
    "this means that while the ideal cat state is so fragile that a single scattered photon is sufficient to collapse that cat onto all - left or all - right states , the cat - like states we are considering should be significantly more robust , giving them a significant advantage provided they are still suitable for whatever application is desired .    to show the dynamics under decoherence induced by these inelastic condensate losses , in fig .",
    "[ decproj ] , we plot the time evolution of the expectation value of the projector @xmath77 , defined in ( [ projection - cat ] ) .",
    "three initial states are shown , the extreme cat state @xmath279/\\sqrt{2}$ ] , the less extreme cat state , @xmath280/\\sqrt{2}$ ] and the wave - packet cat - states produced via dynamical evolution as in section [ dynev ] .    .",
    "figure [ decproj ] is obtained by assuming a single photon is detected in each time interval @xmath281 , where @xmath282 is the number of remaining atoms at time @xmath195 . after each scattering a new density matrix",
    "is obtained by applying eq .",
    "( [ collapse ] ) .",
    "we note that the use of ( [ collapse ] ) automatically weighs the probabilities that the scattering occurs from the l or r mode due to the action of the annihilation operators being proportional to the square root of the mode occupation .",
    "the resulting density matrix is then diagonalized and written @xmath283 where @xmath284 denotes the @xmath285th eigenmode , with @xmath286 its statistical weights over the mixture state .",
    "the resulting eigenmodes @xmath284 s are then analyzed to determine whether or not they are sufficiently cat - like .",
    "this is accomplished by first assigning a value of zero to any state where @xmath287 , where @xmath32 is again the probability amplitudes for the state @xmath26 .",
    "the states which survive this test are then assigned a value equal to the expectation value of the projector @xmath77 .",
    "the assigned values for each eigenmode of the density matrix at time t are then averaged together and the results are plotted versus time .    .    .",
    "from the figure , we verify that the perfect cat state is completely collapsed immediately after one photon scattering .",
    "in contrast , the less extreme cat states has a high probability to remain in a cat - like state even after many scatterings , and , the dynamically created cat - states are similarly robust against decoherence .",
    "we note that in the figure out of an initial population of @xmath288 atoms , @xmath289 remain at the end - time @xmath290 .    in fig .",
    "[ decrho ] , we plot the magnitude of the density matrix after a time of @xmath291 as in fig .",
    "( [ decproj ] ) ( blue solid line ) . in this figure ,",
    "an initial cat state is formed at time @xmath72 via dynamic evolution with no decoherence . the state is then held with @xmath292 and @xmath105 for time @xmath107 with photon - scattering acting as a gradual source of decoherence .",
    "the figure appears to show a collapse of the reduced density matrix onto a statistical mixture of left - centered and right - centered peaks .",
    "however , diagonalization of this matrix reveals that this is not the case . based on numerical diagonalization",
    ", we plot the major eigenmodes @xmath284 of this density matrix in fig .",
    "[ 6modes ] . from the picture ,",
    "some of these resulting eigenmodes , such as @xmath284 s with @xmath293 are still cat - like , in a sense that separation between two peaks are larger than the width of either peak . while for some others , like @xmath294 and @xmath295 , the separation between peaks are not larger than the width of each peak , and thus they are not cat - like .",
    "as more atoms are scattered , the number of remaining atoms decreases , and hence the maximum separation of cat - like states will become will necessarily decrease . because we have chosen projector @xmath35 to be fixed - width filter , those cat - like state with small separations between peaks may not be picked by @xmath35 . as a result",
    ", @xmath77 decreases to almost zero before all atoms are lost , as seen in fig .",
    "( [ decproj ] ) .",
    "lastly , we note that in this section we did not show the effect of inelastic decoherence on the tunneling dynamics during the formation of the cat state .",
    "this can be done by the standard quantum jump method in mento - carlo simulation , which we plan to carry out in future work .",
    "in this section we consider the effects of atom - atom collisions on a cat - state which is frozen by reducing the tunneling strength , @xmath71 , to zero .",
    "if during this hold state the atomic interaction strength , @xmath46 , is nonzero , the system will undergo a dephasing process @xcite , whose dynamics is determined by hamiltonian ( [ no - tunneling ] ) .",
    "the main effect of this dephasing process is that , while it will not collapse the coherence of the cat - state , once the state is dephased , it can not evolve back to the initial coherent state . in this way , a detection scheme based on revivals will incorrectly create the appearance of collape .",
    "therefore , in general , the dephasing effect needs to be suppressed by making the atomic interaction strength @xmath46 , and/or the hold time small .    .",
    "in studying the dephasing effect , first , we note that at each period of @xmath296 , the relative phase of each @xmath32 is exactly restored and thus the many - body states is revived . while between two consequent revivals , nonzero relative phases are introduced to fock basis , and the cat state will collapse . in fig .",
    "[ dephase ] , we show such a rapid dephasing process , where the cat - state decays with a collapse time around @xmath297 , determined from numerical simulations .    to obtain an analytic estimate of the collapse time scale , we assume that our system is prepared in a gaussian - like cat state ( [ cat - gaussian ] ) , which is a good approximation of the realistic cat state in our system . and",
    "then , we associate the collapse and revival of our bimodal system with the evolution of one - body two - mode correlation function @xmath298 , @xmath299 at short time scale , the correlation function ( [ correlated ] ) is obtained , under the condition of that the gaussians are well peaked around @xmath300 , to a good approximation @xcite , @xmath301 and therefore , the collapse time @xmath302 can be estimated by @xmath303    as discuss above , the collisional dephasing will affect the revival process . generally speaking , if the holding time @xmath107 is less than collapse time @xmath302 , the system can still evolve back to the initial state as shown in fig .",
    "[ dephase - revival ] ( a ) .",
    "but under the condition of @xmath304 , the cat state is dephased , and the coherent state can not be restored .",
    "rather it will evolve to a disordered state as shown fig .",
    "[ dephase - revival ] ( b ) .",
    "therefore , for the success of the detection scheme , one should make sure that the dephasing collapse time is longer than the hold time and the revival process is only affected by decoherence .    .",
    "we have considered the double - well bec system and proposed that cat - like states can be formed by switching the sign of the interaction strength from positive to negative using a feshbach resonance .",
    "we examined the possibility of either adiabatic or sudden switching with the following results . in the adiabatic case",
    ", the ground state evolves into a macroscopic superposition state with all of the atoms collectively occupying either the left or right well .",
    "however , by examining the degeneracy of the ground state , we conclude that the cat state is unstable against small perturbations and may readily evolve into a localized state . for the case of a sudden change in the scattering length ,",
    "we find that an initial condensate state evolves dynamically into a double - peaked superposition of number states , with one peak corresponding to the majority of atoms being in one well , and the other peak corresponding to the majority being in the opposite well .",
    "we have shown that this process is stable against perturbations in the initial state , as well as in the control parameters .",
    "for this reason we believe that the dynamical evolution scheme is more likely to be demonstrated experimentally .",
    "in addition , we have demonstrated that continuing the evolution after the cat - state formation results in a nearly complete revival of the initial state .",
    "however , this revival does not occur if the cat - state has collapsed into an incoherent mixed state , so that this revival can be taken as proof of coherence of the initial cat - state .",
    "we note that the states formed via adiabatic switching are maximum ` all or nothing ' cat states , while those formed dynamically are less distinct cat - like states corresponding to a double - peaked distribution in fock - space .",
    "the effects of decoherence due to spontaneous scattering of laser photons have also been studied in detail .",
    "we have determined that decoherence is strongest for the case where the single - photon momentum recoil is not sufficient to remove the atom from its initial state , due to bose - stimulation as the atom remains in an strongly - occupied atomic - field mode . in the opposite regime , where the scattering rate is smaller by a factor of @xmath1 , @xmath1 being the atom number , we find that the maximally entangled ` all or nothing ' cat states are destroyed by the scattering of a single photon , while the dynamically - formed less - extreme cat - like states can survive multiple scatterings without leaving the subspace of cat - like states , in analogy to the effect of atomic collision losses studied in @xcite .",
    "because of this enhanced survivability , the less - extreme cat - states may be more useful for applications , providing they are suitable for the desired protocol .    in this context of ` freezing ' the cat states for a prolonged time , we have also considered the de - phasing effects of atom - atom interactions during this stage , and conclude that collisions can mimic the effects of decoherence with regard to a revival - type measurement , however with regard to applications , they may or may not be detrimental , depending on the type of interaction and/or measurements involved .",
    "we note that in the present proposal , there are three different time scales which we have established : the time need to create cat state @xmath72 , the coherence time @xmath233 and the collisional dephasing time @xmath302 .",
    "first , to generate the cat state , the coherence time scale @xmath233 must longer than @xmath72 . while later , in order to hold the cat state for later use in an application , a hold time @xmath107 shorter than @xmath233 is required to maintain the macroscopic superposition state . and finally , another condition @xmath305 should be satisfied to avoid the dephasing quasi - collapse , if such dephasing is detrimental to the desired application .",
    "the coherence time , @xmath233 , is tunable by adjusting the laser intensity and detuning , while the dephasing time @xmath306 can be adjusted if the interaction strength @xmath46 is modified during the hold stage .",
    "to eliminate the excited state in the master equation ( [ reduced - master ] ) , we note that for a far - off - resonant laser field , the excitation rate in bec is extremely low , which enables us to expand the density matrix to a good approximation as @xmath307 where @xmath308 and @xmath309 stand for the density matrix of none - excitation and one excitation state respectively , while @xmath310 and @xmath311 describe coherence between these two manifolds .",
    "in fact , it is convenient to define a projection operator @xmath312 , which is a projection into a subspace with @xmath313 atomic excitations of the bec system , such that @xmath314 with this expansion , one obtains @xmath315 @xmath316 @xmath317 and @xmath318 in the assumption of low excitation rate , one can adiabatically eliminate @xmath310 and @xmath311 by demanding @xmath319 and @xmath320 respectively , yielding @xmath321 solving this equation perturbatively up to the order @xmath322 , one obtains          nextt , we apply a similar adiabatic elimination process eliminate the excited state matrix @xmath309 . to do that , first we normal order the ground state operators in above equation , and then by setting @xmath327 , obtains          this express for @xmath309 can be simplified by normal ordering . finally , we insert the normal ordered @xmath330 back into eq .",
    "( [ rho00 ] ) , and keep only terms up to @xmath322 . meanwhile , since the number density of atoms in bec is small , we drop any 3-body and above terms . with these two assumptions ,",
