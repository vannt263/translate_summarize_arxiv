    "the energy transport properties of lattice vibrations in crystalline solids have recently attracted much research activity . in the simplest case energy",
    "is the only relevant conserved quantity , and then it is expected that for a large class of three or higher dimensional systems energy transport is diffusive and the fourier s law of heat conduction holds ; see for instance @xcite for a discussion . in contrast , many one - dimensional systems exhibit anomalous energy transport violating the fourier s law .",
    "section 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite offers a concise summary of the state of the art in the results and understanding of transport properties of such systems .",
    "if a suitable stochastic noise is added to the hamiltonian interactions , also one - dimensional particle chains can produce diffusive energy transport .",
    "a particularly appealing test case is obtained by taking a harmonic chain , which has ballistic energy transport @xcite , and endowing each of the particles with its own poissonian clock whose rings will flip the velocity of the particle . to our knowledge , this _ velocity flip model _ was first considered in @xcite , and it is one of the simplest known particle chain models which has a finite heat conductivity and satisfies the time - dependent fourier s law .",
    "its transport properties depend on the harmonic interactions , most importantly on whether the forces have an on - site component ( _ pinning _ ) or not . for nearest neighbor interactions ,",
    "if there is no pinning , there are two locally conserved fields , while with pinning there is only one , the energy density .",
    "in addition , the thermal conductivity , and hence the energy diffusion constant , happens to be independent of temperature , which implies that the fourier s law corresponds to a _ linear _ heat equation .",
    "this allows for explicit representation of its solutions in terms of fourier transform .",
    "it also leads to the useful simplification that for any stochastic initial state also the expectation value of the temperature distribution satisfies the fourier s law , even when the initial total energy has macroscopic variation .",
    "the main goal of the present contribution is to introduce a mathematical method which allows splitting the dynamics of the velocity flip model into local and global components in a controlled manner .",
    "the local evolution can then be chosen conveniently to simplify the analysis .",
    "for instance , here we show how to apply the method to separate the harmonic interactions and a dissipation term generated by the noise into explicitly solvable local dynamics .",
    "although created with perturbation theory in mind , the method itself is non - perturbative .",
    "in fact , our main result will assume the exact opposite : we work in the regime in which the noise dominates over the harmonic evolution , as then it will be possible to neglect certain resonant terms which otherwise would require more involved analysis .",
    "the method of splitting is quite generic but in the end it only amounts to reorganization of the original dynamics .",
    "therefore , it is important to demonstrate that it can become a useful tool also in practice . as a test case , we study here the velocity flip model with pinning and in the regime where the noise dominates , i.e. , the flipping rate is high enough .",
    "the ultimate goal is to prove that this system _ thermalizes _ for any sensible initial data : after some initial time @xmath2 any local correlation function , i.e. , an expectation value of a polynomial of positions and velocities of particles microscopically close to some given point , is well approximated by the corresponding expectation taken over some statistical equilibrium ( thermal ) ensemble .",
    "the thermalization time @xmath2 may depend on the initial data and on the system size but for systems with `` normal '' transport this time should be less than diffusive , @xmath3 , where @xmath1 denotes the length of the chain .",
    "we do not have a proof of such a strong statement yet and we only indicate how the present methods should help in arriving at such conclusions . instead of the full local statistics , we focus here on the time evolution of the _ average kinetic temperature profile _ , the observables @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the momentum of the particle at the site @xmath6 at time @xmath7",
    "the momentum is a random variable whose value depends both on the realization of the flips and on the distribution of the initial data at @xmath8 .",
    "we use @xmath9 to denote the corresponding expectation values .",
    "we prove here that for a large class of harmonic interactions with pinning , the average kinetic temperature profile does thermalize and its evolution will follow the time evolution dictated by the dynamic fourier s law as soon as a thermalization period @xmath10 has passed .    as mentioned above , the velocity flip model has been studied before , using several different methods from numerical to mathematically rigorous analysis . in @xcite , it was proven that every translation invariant stationary state of the infinite chain with a finite entropy density is given by a mixture of canonical gibbs states , hence with temperature as the sole parameter .",
    "this was shown to hold even when fairly generic anharmonic interactions are included . since the dynamics conserves total energy , this provides strong support to the idea that energy is the only ergodic variable in the velocity flip model with pinning .",
    "results from numerical analysis of the velocity flip model are described in @xcite . there",
    "the covariance of the nonequilibrium steady state of a chain with langevin heat baths attached to both ends was analyzed , and it was observed that the second order correlations in the steady state coincide with those of a similar , albeit more strongly stochastic , model of particles coupled everywhere to self - consistently chosen heat baths @xcite .",
    "hence , in its steady state the stationary fourier s law is satisfied with an explicit formula for the thermal conductivity ; the full mathematical treatment of the case without pinning is given in @xcite .",
    "it was later proven that , unlike the self - consistent heat bath model , the velocity flip model satisfies also the dynamic fourier s law .",
    "this was postulated in @xcite , based on earlier mathematical work on similar models by bernardin and olla ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and it was later proven by simon in @xcite .",
    "( although the details are only given for the case without pinning , it is mentioned in the remark after theorem 1.2 that the proofs can be adapted to include interactions with pinning . ) also the structure of steady state correlations and energy fluctuations are discussed in @xcite with supporting numerical evidence presented in @xcite . for a more general explanatory discussion about hydrodynamic fluctuation theory , we refer to a recent preprint by spohn @xcite .    the strategy for proving the hydrodynamic limit in @xcite was based on relative entropy methods introduced by yau @xcite and varadhan @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for more references and details .",
    "there one begins by assuming that the initial state is close to a local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) state , which allows for unique definition of the initial profiles of the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "one considers the relative entropy _ density _",
    "( i.e. , entropy divided by the volume ) of the state evolved up to time @xmath7 with respect to a local equilibrium state constructed from the hydrodynamic fields at time @xmath7 , and the goal is to show that the entropy density approaches zero in the infinite volume limit .    in the present work we improve on the result proven in @xcite in two ways .",
    "we prove that it is not necessary to assume that the initial state is close to an lte state ; indeed , our main theorem is applicable for arbitrary deterministic initial data , including those in which just one of the sites carries energy . instead , we allow for an initial thermalization period ",
    "infinitesimal on the diffusive time scale  and only after the period has passed is the evolution of the temperature profile shown to follow a continuum heat equation . in particle systems",
    "directly coupled to diffusion processes similar results have been obtained before : for instance , in the references @xcite a hydrodynamic limit is proven assuming only convergence of initial data .",
    "however , as discussed in remarks 3.5 of @xcite , even assuming a convergence restricts the choice of initial data but we do not need to do it here .",
    "secondly , we show that the fourier s law has a version involving a lattice diffusion kernel for which the temperature profile is well approximated by its macroscopic value at every lattice site and at every time after the themalization period .",
    "this improves on the standard estimates which only imply that the _ macroscopic averages _ of the two profiles coincide in the limit @xmath11 . as shown in @xcite",
    ", it is sometimes possible to use averaging over smaller regions , of diameter @xmath12 , @xmath13 , but it is not easy to see how relative entropy alone could be used to control local microscopic properties of the solution .",
    "the precise statements and assumptions for our main results are given in theorem [ th : maintprof ] and corollary [ th : maincoroll ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : tprofile ] .",
    "however , in two respects our result is less informative than the one in @xcite .",
    "firstly , we only describe the evolution of the _ average _ temperature profile , whereas the relative entropy methods produce statements which describe the hydrodynamic limit profiles _ in probability_. secondly , we do not prove here that the full statistics can be locally approximated by equilibrium measures , although the estimate for the temperature profile does indicate that this should be the case .",
    "the thermalization of the other degrees of freedom is only briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lte ] where we introduce a local version of the dynamic replica method .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we recall the definition of the velocity flip model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] and introduce various related notations there . the first version of the new tool , called _ global dynamic replica method _",
    ", is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : global ] where we also discuss how it might be applied to prove global equilibration for this model .",
    "this discussion , as well as the one involving the _ local dynamic replica method _ in sec .  [ sec : lte ] , is not completely mathematically rigorous , for instance , due to missing regularity assumptions .",
    "we have also included a discussion about applications of the dynamic replica method to other models in sec .",

    "we have included some related but previously known material in two appendices .",
    "appendix [ sec : applocal ] concerns the explicit solution of the local dynamic semigroup , and in appendix [ sec : diffkernel ] we derive the main properties of the green s function solution of the renewal equation describing the evolution of the temperature profile .",
    "mainly for notational simplicity , we consider here only one - dimensional periodic crystals , i.e. , particles on a circle . for @xmath1 particles",

    "the canonical pair of variables for the site @xmath6 are the position @xmath62 , and the momentum @xmath63 .",
    "the hamiltonian evolution is combined with a velocity - flip noise .",
    "the resulting system can be identified with a markov process @xmath64 and the process generates a feller semigroup on the space of observables vanishing at infinity , see @xcite for mathematical details .",
    "then for @xmath65 and any @xmath66 in the domain of the generator @xmath67 of the feller process the expectation values of @xmath68 satisfy an evolution equation @xmath69    we consider the time evolution of the moment generating function @xmath70 where @xmath71 belongs to some fixed neighborhood of @xmath72 .",
    "although the observable @xmath73 does not vanish at infinity , @xmath74 is always well defined , and we assume that it satisfies the evolution equation dictated by ( [ eq : mainevoleq ] ) . this will require some additional constraints on the distribution of initial data , but for instance it should suffice that all second moments of @xmath75 are finite .",
    "( the existence of initial second moments will also be an assumption for our main theorem . )    ultimately , the goal is to prove thermalization , i.e. , the appearance of local thermal equilibrium .",
    "more precisely , we would like to prove that after a thermalization period the local restrictions of the generating functional are well approximated by mixtures of equilibrium expectations . to do such a comparison ,",
    "the first step is to classify the generating functions of equilibrium states .",
    "we start with a heuristic argument based on ergodicity which gives a particularly appealing formulation for the present case in which the canonical gibbs states are gaussian measures .",
    "suppose that the evolution of our finite system is ergodic , with energy as the only ergodic variable .",
    "then for any invariant measure @xmath76 there is a borel probability measure @xmath77 on @xmath78 such that for any @xmath79 we have @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the microcanonical partition function .",
    "( details about mathematical ergodic theory can be found for instance from @xcite . ) hence , if @xmath82 is an initial state which converges towards a steady state @xmath76 , we have for any observable @xmath83 @xmath84 applying this for @xmath85 , @xmath86 continuous with a compact support , we find by conservation of @xmath87 that @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we can formally identify @xmath89 .",
    "finally , we can rewrite the somewhat unwieldy microcanonical expectations in terms of the canonical gaussian measures by using the representation @xmath90 which should be valid for all sufficiently nice @xmath83 and @xmath91 . applying this representation to @xmath92 yields @xmath93 , where the canonical partition function is @xmath94 .",
    "hence , we arrive at the conjecture that for all sufficiently nice initial data @xmath82 @xmath95 by a change of variables to @xmath96 and using the fact that @xmath97 , the limit function can also be represented in the form @xmath98 where the integral is taken around a circle in the right half of the complex plane and @xmath99 is a complex measure satisfying @xmath100 .    for any fixed initial data",
    "@xmath101 with energy @xmath102 , there is a natural choice for the parameter @xmath103 as the unique solution to the equation @xmath104 .",
    "this choice coincides with the unique saddle point for @xmath105 on the positive real axis , i.e. , it is the only @xmath91 for which @xmath106 with @xmath107",
    ". then also @xmath108 and hence the integration path in ( [ eq : ftlim ] ) follows the path of steepest descent through the saddle point .",
    "as the energy variance typically is proportional to the volume , the integrand should be concentrated to the real axis , with a standard deviation @xmath109 .",
    "hence , for fixed initial data and large @xmath1 we would expect to have here equivalence of ensembles in the form @xmath110 .",
    "in order to treat the local dynamics independently , we replicate the whole chain at each lattice site , and transform the evolution equation into a new form by selecting some terms to act on the replicated direction .",
    "we use a generating function with variables @xmath111 , where each @xmath112 controls the random variable @xmath113 , and we think of @xmath6 as the original site and @xmath114 as the position in its `` replica '' .",

    "we choose here to use it as indicated by the choice of summation variables in ( [ eq : htevol1 ] ) .",
    "since in the summand always @xmath132 this results in the evolution equation @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the standard gradient , i.e. , it is a vector whose @xmath135-component is @xmath136 , and @xmath137 since @xmath138 , this can also be written as @xmath139 for any @xmath116 resulting from the replication procedure , we obviously have @xmath140 whenever @xmath141 . hence , by taylor expansion with remainder up to second order @xmath142    now for any continuously differentiable function @xmath143 @xmath144 setting @xmath145 and @xmath146 thus yields the `` duhamel formula '' @xmath147 in this formula , the replica dynamics has been exponentiated in the operator semigroup @xmath148 .",
    "no approximations have been made in the derivation of the formula , but to show that its solutions , under some natural assumptions , are unique and correspond to lte states does not look straightforward . we do not attempt to do it here . instead , the formula will be used in the next section to derive a closed evolution equation for the temperature profile .",
    "we conclude the section by showing that eq .",
    "( [ eq : htiter ] ) is consistent with the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "suppose @xmath77 is a complex bounded measure on @xmath149 , for some @xmath91",
    ". then @xmath150 , with @xmath151 , solves ( [ eq : htiter ] ) . to see this , first note that the first two terms in the integrand cancel , since @xmath152 and thus @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the value of the integral is equal to @xmath154 .",
    "here @xmath155 , with @xmath156 where in the second equality we have used the periodicity of @xmath157 . however , then @xmath158 , and thus @xmath159 . hence , the functions of @xmath117 defined by setting @xmath160 on the right hand side of ( [ eq : ftlim ] ) are solutions to the equation ( [ eq : htiter ] ) . to check that energy is the only ergodic variable one would need to prove that there are no other time - independent solutions .",
    "we postpone the analysis of this question to a future work , although by the results proven in @xcite it would seem to be a plausible conjecture .",
    "since the `` replicated '' generating function satisfies ( [ eq : htiter ] ) , a direct differentiation results in an evolution equation for the kinetic temperature profile @xmath161 .",
    "we obtain @xmath162 where each @xmath163 is a symmetric matrix obtained by a periodic translation of the matrix of the initial second moments .",
    "the final sum can be transformed into a standard convolution form by changing the summation variable @xmath164 .",
    "this yields @xmath165 where for @xmath166 , @xmath119 , the `` source term '' @xmath83 and the `` memory kernel '' @xmath167 are given by @xmath168 with the following shorthand @xmath169    we will prove later that @xmath170 and that @xmath171 .",
    "hence , mathematically the equation ( [ eq : tevoleq ] ) has the structure of a generalized _ renewal equation_. renewal equations have bounded solutions in great generality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  9.15 ) .",
    "the problem is closely connected to tauberian theory ; the classical paper by karlin @xcite contains a discussion and detailed analysis of the standard case .",
    "unfortunately , most of these results are not of direct use here since they do not give estimates for the speed of convergence towards the asymptotic value and thus can not be used for estimating the @xmath1-dependence of the asymptotics .",
    "nevertheless , the standard methods can be applied to an extent also in the present case : in appendix [ sec : diffkernel ] we give the details for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to ( [ eq : tevoleq ] ) and derive an explicit representation of the solutions using laplace transforms .",
    "the analysis relies on upper and lower bounds for the tail behavior of @xmath172 .",
    "these follow from explicit formulae for the solutions of the semigroup @xmath173 derived in appendix [ sec : applocal ] .",
    "in particular , we have for any @xmath174 @xmath175 where @xmath176 in principle , the formulae should only be used if @xmath177 which implies @xmath178 .",
    "however , they also hold for all other values of @xmath179 if extended using the following `` analytic continuation '' : if @xmath180 , we set @xmath181 and the values for case @xmath182 agree with the limit @xmath183 .",
    "since we consider here the case in which the noise dominates , only the expressions in ( [ eq : aiexp ] ) will be needed in the following .",
    "we begin by summarizing the regularity assumptions about the free evolution , already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . without additional effort",
    ", we can relax the assumption of @xmath31 having a finite support to mere exponential decay .",

    "the assumptions imply that the fourier transform of @xmath31 can be extended to an analytic map @xmath192 on the strip @xmath193 , and the extension is @xmath194-periodic . by continuity and periodicity of @xmath195 , we can then find @xmath196 such that @xmath197 on the strip @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , the infinite volume dispersion relation has the following regularity properties :    assume @xmath31 satisfies the assumptions in [ th : phiassump ] .",
    "then @xmath199 , @xmath191 , defines a smooth function on @xmath200 which satisfies @xmath201 and @xmath202 for all @xmath203 .",
    "in addition , there is @xmath196 such that @xmath204 has an analytic , @xmath194-periodic continuation to the region @xmath198 .    from now on",
    "we assume that @xmath31 satisfies assumption [ th : phiassump ] and @xmath205 is some fixed flipping rate .",
    "this already fixes the functions @xmath206 defined above .",
    "however , here we aim at convenient exponential bounds for the errors from diffusive evolution of the temperature profile .",
    "this requires to rule out resonant behavior , which can be achieved if the noise flipping rate is high enough and the dispersion relation satisfies a certain integral bound excluding degenerate behavior .",
    "explicitly , we only consider @xmath207 and @xmath31 satisfying the following :        the nondegeneracy condition is satisfied by the nearest neighbor interactions , for which @xmath211 with @xmath189 .",

    "however , the condition fails for the degenerate next - to - nearest neighbor coupling which skips over the nearest neighbors : then @xmath214 and thus for @xmath215 we have @xmath216 for all @xmath179 , hence the integral in ( [ eq : nondegcond ] ) evaluates to zero at @xmath215 . instead of including a formal proof of these statements ,",

    "the first of the bounds implies that the temperature profile equilibrates , and the relative error is exponentially decaying on the diffusive time scale , i.e. , as @xmath235 becomes large .",
    "the second statement says that solving the `` lattice diffusion equation '' @xmath236 with initial data @xmath237 provides an approximation to the temperature profile which is accurate even before the diffusive time scale , for @xmath238 .",
    "a closer inspection of the proof of the theorem reveals that the main contribution to the error bound given in ( [ eq : tlatticediff ] ) comes from `` memory effects '' of the original time evolution .",
    "these corrections can estimated using a bound which for large @xmath7 and @xmath1 behaves as @xmath239 . the rest of the factors can be uniformly bounded using the total energy , resulting in the bound in ( [ eq : tlatticediff ] ) .",
