    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute atomic gases have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally since its experimental realization in 1995  @xcite . in particular , bec involving internal degree of freedom has been extensively studied .",
    "the first experiment confining bec with multi internal states was achieved by jila group  @xcite . shortly afterward , they succeeded in confining @xmath0 atoms with two internal states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which is called spin-1/2 bose gas  @xcite .",
    "spin-1/2 bose gases are known to exhibit the collective spin dynamics due to the exchange effect even above the bose - einstein transition temperature ( @xmath3 )  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the spinor condensate trapped in an optical trap has been achieved experimentally .",
    "an optical trap can trap atoms with maintaining spin degree of freedom in contrast to magnetic trap where the spin degree of freedom is frozen .",
    "the mit group first succeeded in creating a spinor condensate in an optical trap for @xmath4 ( so called spin-1 bec )  @xcite . in the spin-1 system , the spin - spin interaction that describes the collision of two atoms exchanging there internal states plays an important role , even though they are very small compared with the usual spin - independent interaction  @xcite .",
    "moreover in the spin-1 system , these components couple automatically through intrinsic spin - spin interaction .",
    "this is in contrast to the spin-1/2 system , where these components couple with each other through the exchange effect .",
    "we thus expect the spin-1 bose gas to exhibit much richer spin dynamics than in the spin-1/2 system .",
    "even though most of the studies in the dynamics of spin-1 bose gases have focused on a pure condensate , there have also been a growing interest in finite - temperature properties  @xcite . in our previous paper , we discussed the spin - wave collective modes with dipole symmetry above @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "we showed that the spin-1 bose gas exhibits a fascinating dynamics even if above @xmath3 and we indicated that the spin-1 bose condensate gas below @xmath3 will exhibit much richer dynamics due to the interaction between condensate and noncondensate atoms in addition to the spin - spin interaction .",
    "one of the most interesting experiments of the dynamics of spin-1 bose condensed gases at finite temperatures is the population dynamics of each internal state  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "one found that the condensates do not conserve the total spin by themselves .",
    "in addition , the existence of the condensate enhances equilibration of the noncondensate component  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in this property .    in this paper , we first derive rate equations for spin-1 bose gases above @xmath3 . solving the rate equations ,",
    "we discuss the population dynamics .",
    "we estimate characteristic time required to reach equilibrium . in the experiment ,",
    "the time evolution of the particle numbers of each internal state was observed below @xmath3 where both condensate and noncondensate atoms are present  @xcite .",
    "comparing our theory , which only includes noncondensate atoms , with this experiment , we discuss how the existence of the condensate atoms will affect to the population dynamics .",

    "the time evolution of the nonequilibrium system is described by the wigner distribution function @xmath37 knowledge of this function allows one to calculate various nonequilibrium physical quantities , such as the local density given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 . using a semiclassical approximation to describe atomic motion in terms of a phase - space distribution function",

    "next , we integrate eq.([wigner100 ] ) over @xmath54 and @xmath55 to obtain rate equations for the particle number . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the hartree - fock effective potential in the single - particle energy @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 we also assume that the temperatures of three internal states are close to each other , so we only retain terms to second order in fluctuations of @xmath64 .",
