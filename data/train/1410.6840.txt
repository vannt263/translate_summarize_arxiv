    "demand response management involves a set of operations aiming at decentralizing load control in power networks @xcite . in particular",
    ", it calls for the alteration of the timing , of the level of instantaneous demand , or of the total electricity by end - use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time .",
    "this is possible also through an opportune design of incentive payments to induce lower electricity use at off - peak times .",
    "a communication protocol aggregates relevant information on the past , current and forecasted demand and transmits it to each fully responsive load controller or decision mechanism , which will adopt opportune actions such as increasing or decreasing the proper load or energy demand .",
    "the novelty of this paper is in that _ fully responsive load control _ together with the many cooperative and competitive aspects involved in the process , are now reviewed as a game with a large number of indistinguishable players , these being the single loads . for illustrative purposes , in this paper , fully responsive load control is reviewed in the context of thermostatically controlled loads ( tcls ) , in smart buildings or plug - in electric vehicles @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : demandresponse ] .    [ h ]    a first idea of this work , which is common also to @xcite , is to adopt stochastic response strategies rather than deterministic .",
    "this means that each tcl selects a probability with which to activate one of the two functioning modes , _ on _ and _ off_. thus a probability value of @xmath0 means that the tcl is @xmath1 _ on _ and @xmath1 _ off_. it has been shown in @xcite that stochastic response strategies outperform deterministic ones , especially in terms of attenuating the _ mains frequency _ oscillations .",
    "these are due to the unbalance between energy demand and supply ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the mains frequency usually needs to be stabilized around a nominal value ( 50 hz in europe ) .",
    "if electrical demand exceeds generation then frequency will decline , and vice versa .    a qualitative plot of such an oscillatory phenomenon is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillations ] .",
    "the two rows depict the time plot of the state of each tcl , namely the temperature in the top row and the mode of functioning in the bottom row . here",
    "each tcl increases or decreases its proper load in response to the current network load , and as clear visually , this induces oscillations in the mains frequency due to an undesired synchronized reaction of the whole population of tcls .",
    "this preamble introduces the main aim of this paper , which studies constructive design methods of distributed demand response management strategies in order to reduce the mains frequency oscillations and stabilize both the temperature and the functioning mode of the tcls .",
    "[ htb ]     the model used in this paper is as follows .",
    "each single tcl is a player and is characterized by two state variables , the temperature and the functioning mode .",
    "the state dynamics of a tcl  henceforth referred to as _",
    "microscopic _ dynamics to distinguish it from the dynamics of the aggregate temperature and functioning mode of the whole population , the latter called _ macroscopic _ dynamics  describes the time evolution of its temperature and mode in the form of a linear ordinary differential equation in the deterministic case , and of a stochastic differential equation in the stochastic case .",
    "in addition to the state dynamics , each tcl is programmed with a given finite - horizon cost functional that accounts for i ) energy consumption , ii ) deviation of mains frequency from the nominal one , and iii ) deviation of the tcl s temperature from a reference value .",
    "more formally , the mains frequency involved in the specifics ii ) is used in a cross - coupling mean - field term that incentivizes the tcl to switch to @xmath2 if the mains frequency is below the nominal value and to switch to @xmath3 if the mains frequency is above the nominal value . in other words , the cross - coupling mean - field term models all kinds of incentive payments , benefits , or smart pricing policies aiming at shifting demand from high - peak to off - peak periods .",
    "this paper provides three main results .",
    "first , in the spirit of prescriptive game theory and mechanism design @xcite we design a mean - field game for the tcls application , study the mean - field equilibrium for the deterministic mean - field game and investigate on asymptotic stability for the microscopic dynamics .",
    "asymptotic stability means that both the temperature and the mode functioning of each tcl converges to the reference value .",
    "a second result relates to the stochastic case , characterized by a stochastic disturbance in the form of a brownian motion in the microscopic dynamics . after establishing a mean - field equilibrium , we provide some results on stochastic stability . in particular , we focus on two distinct scenarios . in one case , we assume that the stochastic disturbance expires in a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "this reflects in having the brownian motion coefficients linear in the state .",
    "the resulting dynamics is well - known in the literature as geometric brownian motion . as for any geometric brownian motion",
    ", we can study conditions for it to be stochastically stable almost surely .",
    "this means that the state trajectories converge to zero with probability one . in a second case ,",
    "the stochastic disturbance is independent on the state and the brownian motion coefficients are constant .",
    "this leads to a dynamics which resembles the langevin equation . following well - known results on the langevin equation ,",
    "the dynamics is proven to be stochastically stable in the second - moment .",
    "an expository work on stochastic analysis and stability is @xcite . a third result deals with robustness for the microscopic dynamics .",
    "the dynamics is now influenced by an additional adversarial disturbance , with bounded resource or energy .",
    "even for this case , we study the mean - field equilibrium and investigate on conditions that guarantee worst - case stability .",
    "we introduce next two streams of literature .",
    "one is related to dynamic response management , while the second one is about the theory of differential games with a large number of indistinguishable players , also known as mean - field games .",
    "examples of papers developing the idea of dynamic demand management are @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite provides an overview on the redistribution of the load away from peak hours and the design of decentralized strategies to produce a predefined load trajectory . this idea is further developed in @xcite . to understand the role of game theory in respect to this specific context the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "there , the authors present a large population game where the agents are plug - in electric vehicles and the nash - equilibrium strategies ( see @xcite ) correspond to distributed charging policies that redistribute the load away from peaks .",
    "the resulting strategies are known with the name of _ valley - filling strategies_. in this paper we adopt the same perspective in that we show that network frequency stabilization can be achieved by giving incentives to the agents to adjust their strategies in order to converge to a mean field equilibrium . to do this , in the spirit of _ prescriptive",
    "game theory _ @xcite , a central planner or game designer has to design the individual objective function so to penalize those agents that are in @xmath3 state in peak hours , as well as those who are in @xmath2 state in off - peak hours .",
    "valley - filling and coordination strategies have been shown particularly efficient in thermostatically controlled loads such as refrigerators , air conditioners and electric water heaters @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are in accordance with the recent results in @xcite , according to which , stochastic control laws are in general more appropriate than deterministic ones when it comes to desynchronize the appliances functioning .      a second stream of literature related to the problem at hand is on mean - field games .",
    "mean - field games were formulated by lasry and lions in @xcite and independently by m.y .",
    "huang , p. e. caines and r. malham in @xcite .",
    "the mean - field theory of dynamical games is a modeling framework at the interface of differential game theory , mathematical physics , and @xmath4-optimal control that tries to capture the mutual influence between a crowd and its individuals . from a mathematical point of view",
    "the mean - field approach leads to a system of two pdes .",
    "the first pde is the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation .",
    "the second pde is the fokker - planck - kolmogorov ( fpk ) equation which describes the density of the players .",
    "explicit solutions in terms of mean - field equilibria are available for linear - quadratic mean - field games @xcite , and have been recently extended to more general cases in @xcite .",
    "in addition to explicit solutions , a variety of solution schemes have been recently proposed based on discretization and/or numerical approximations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the idea of extending the state space , which originates in optimal control @xcite , has been also used to approximate mean - field equilibria in @xcite .",
    "more recently , robustness and risk - sensitivity have been brought into the picture of mean - field games @xcite , where the first pde is now the hamilton - jacobi - isaacs ( hji ) equation . for a survey on mean - field games and applications we refers the reader to @xcite .",
    "a first attempt to apply mean - field games to demand management is in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we state the problem and introduce the model . in section [ sec : prel ] we review some preliminary results . in section [ mainresults ]",

    "with regards to the problem at hand , the topic of dynamic response management has sparked the attention of scientists from different disciplines .",
    "this is witnessed by the rapid growing of publications in journals of different research areas , from differential game theory @xcite , to control and optimization @xcite , to computer science @xcite .",
    "one reason for this is that dynamic response management intersects research programs in _ smart buildings _ and _ smart cities_. the problem is relevant due to an ever - increasing size of network systems and the consequent impossibility of centralizing the management of the whole system .",
    "fully aware of the importance of the topic , let us discuss the relevance of the results of this paper .",
    "first , it must be said that the game - theoretic approach presented here is a natural way to deal with larges scale , complex and distributed systems where no central planner may be capable of processing all information data and in order to control the whole system online .",
    "one way to deal with this issue , and which is the main idea of dynamic demand management , aims at assigning part of the regulation burden to the consumers by using frequency responsive appliances .",
    "in other words , each appliance regulates automatically and in a decentralized fashion its power demand based on the mains frequency .    in this respect ,",
    "the provided model builds upon the strategic interaction among the electrical appliances .",
    "note that here we look at the problem in more general terms and talk about electrical appliances rather than tcls .",
    "the model suits the case where where the latter are numerous and indistinguishable .",
    "indistinguishable means that any appliance in the same condition will react at the same way .",
    "we wish to highlight that indistinguishability is not a limitation , as in the case of heterogeneity of the electrical appliances , more complex multi - population models may be derived based on the same modeling approach used here .    the results provided in this paper shed light on the existence of mean - field equilibrium solutions . by this",
    "we mean strategies based on the current and forecasted demand , which are proven to attenuate oscillations of mains frequency .",
    "a first feature of the model at hand is that the considered strategies are stochastic .",
    "this means that the tcl sets a probability with which to switch @xmath3 or @xmath2 .",
    "stochastic linear strategies are designed as closed - loop feedback strategies on current state , temperature and switching mode .",
    "such strategies are computed over a finite horizon and therefore are based on forecasted demand . from another angle , we may say that mean - field equilibrium strategies represent the asymptotic limit of nash equilibrium strategies , and as such they are the best - response strategies of even single player , for fixed behavior of other players .",
    "the proven stability of the microscopic dynamics confirms the asymptotic convergence of the tcls s states to an equilibrium point , this being expressed in terms of temperature and switching mode .",
    "the several cases studied in the paper have shown that this holds true in the cases of both perfect and imperfect modeling .",
    "this is a clear evidence of a certain degree of robustness characterizing the proposed strategies . in the case of imperfect modeling , model mis - specifications",
    "is considered both in a stochastic and deterministic worst - case scenario .",
    "assuming imperfect models both with a stochastic or worst - case deterministic disturbance acting on the state dynamics , conditions for convergence of the microscopic dynamics are provided .",
    "we have illustrated robust mean - field games as a paradigm for crowd - averse systems . we have discussed these systems in the context of stock market , production engineering , and dynamic demand management in power systems . as main contributions",
    "we first have formulated the problem as a robust mean - field game ; second , we have presented a new approximation method based on the extension of the state space ; third we have discussed a relaxation method to minimize the approximation error .",
    "further results are obtained for a scalar microscopic dynamics , for which we have established performance bounds , and analyzed stochastic stability of both the microscopic and the macroscopic dynamics .",
    "we can extend our study in at least three directions .",
    "these include i ) the extension of the approximation method to more general cost functionals , ii ) the study of the case with `` local '' mean - field interactions rather than `` global '' as in the current scenario , and iii ) the analysis of crowd - seeking scenarios in contrast to the crowd - averse cases analyzed in this paper .",

    "<S> within the realm of dynamic of _ smart buildings _ and _ smart cities _ , dynamic response management is playing an ever - increasing role thus attracting the attention of scientists from different disciplines . </S>",
    "<S> dynamic demand response management involves a set of operations aiming at decentralizing the control of loads in large and complex power networks . each single appliance if fully responsive and readjusts its energy demand to the overall network load . </S>",
    "<S> a main issue is related to mains frequency oscillations resulting from an unbalance between supply and demand . in a nutshell </S>",
    "<S> , this paper contributes to the topic by equipping each signal consumer with strategic insight . in particular , we highlight three main contributions and a few other minor contributions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we design a mean - field game for the tcls application , study the mean - field equilibrium for the deterministic mean - field game and investigate on asymptotic stability for the microscopic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> second , we extend the analysis and design to imperfect models which involve both stochastic or deterministic disturbances . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to robust mean - field equilibrium strategies guaranteeing stochastic and worst - case stability , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> minor contributions involve the use of stochastic control strategies rather than deterministic , and some numerical studies illustrating the efficacy of the proposed strategies . </S>"
