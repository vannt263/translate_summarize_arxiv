    "dilute magnetic semiconductors , such as ( ga , mn)as , form a class of materials with many outstanding properties@xcite and functionalities.@xcite a number of these result from the complex structure of the valence band , which hosts holes mediating magnetic order between spins localized on transition metal impurities . the strong force which lies behind this mechanism",
    "is the carrier - mediated exchange interaction .",
    "it gives the low - lying energy states of such a system the character of spin waves , which contribute to both its equilibrium ( e.g.  spontaneous magnetization and curie temperature ) and nonequilibrium magnetic properties ( ferromagnetic resonance and relaxation).@xcite at the same time , it allows us to replace the atomic quantum - mechanical description of the system with the classical , continuous micromagnetic theory , where it appears in form of exchange stiffness.@xcite    quite generally , micromagnetic properties of any ferromagnet are determined by the magnitudes of the exchange stiffness and magnetocrystalline anisotropy.@xcite the first describes the exchange energy associated with nonuniform distributions of local directions of magnetization .",
    "the other is the energy needed to change the total magnetization direction with respect to the crystal axes , which involves the competing crystal - field and spin - orbit interactions . while the main part of the exchange energy is isotropic , a consequence of its electrostatic origin , the relativistic spin - orbit coupling can create its small anisotropy , namely the dependence on the crystalline orientation of magnetization . in zinc - blende bulk crystals and thin layers with broken space inversion symmetries , it leads to many interesting effects , related to the anisotropic@xcite and dzyaloshinskii - moriya@xcite exchange , which have not been hitherto studied in ( ga , mn)as . since the total spin is no longer conserved , they are indispensable when considering any usage of spins for information storage and processing .    the spin - wave spectrum and the isotropic exchange stiffness in bulk ( ga , mn)as were computed by knig , jungwirth and macdonald,@xcite and by brey and gmez - santos@xcite within the @xmath0 zener model employing the six - band @xmath2 hamiltonian,@xcite which neglects the inversion asymmetry specific to the zinc - blende lattice .",
    "it was found that the actual magnitude of the exchange stiffness is much greater when one takes into account the complex structure of the valence band , as compared to the case of a simple parabolic band.@xcite this , as well as the highly anisotropic fermi surface , were shown to explain@xcite why the mean - field approximation@xcite is so accurate in ( ga , mn)as .",
    "it was also found that the values of exchange and anisotropy energies obtained within the same formalism describe quantitatively@xcite the width of stripe domains in films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy .",
    "more recently , bouzerar@xcite employed a self - consistent local random - phase approximation in order to evaluate the spectral density of spin - wave excitations in ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as .",
    "the magnitudes of spin - spin exchange integrals @xmath5 were obtained from first principles computations within the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) and tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital approach neglecting the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the theory allows to treat disorder and thermal fluctuations , and shows that the calculated spectral density has well - defined maxima up to about one half of the relevant debye wave vector @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the lattice constant .",
    "this made it possible to determine the spin - wave dispersion @xmath8 in the range @xmath9 , from which the magnitude of spin - wave stiffness was obtained.@xcite    experimentally , potashnik _",
    "et al._@xcite analyzed the temperature dependence of magnetization in a series of ga@xmath3mn@xmath10as samples , which provided the values of spin - wave stiffness from the @xmath11 bloch law . in later experiments ,",
    "the stiffness was determined by examining spin precession modes excited by optical pulses@xcite and under ferromagnetic resonance conditions.@xcite the values obtained for some films with thickness greater than 120  nm , either as - grown@xcite or annealed,@xcite are in good agreement with those predicted by bouzerar.@xcite however , the values for thinner films@xcite or another series of annealed samples@xcite were about three times smaller .",
    "similarly small magnitudes of spin - wave stiffness were found by analyzing the domain structure of annealed ga@xmath12mn@xmath13as.@xcite the experimental works@xcite demonstrate that spectral positions of spin - wave resonances are strongly affected by the character of spin pinning at the sample borders .",
    "the same effect is caused by magnetic anisotropy changes along the growth direction , particularly strong at the film interface and surface.@xcite therefore , theoretical predictions concerning spin - wave excitations in both thick and thin layers may provide a useful guide to better understanding of magnetization dynamics in real samples .",
    "in this paper we investigate spin waves and related micromagnetic constants in ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)as , as described by the @xmath0 zener model.@xcite the validity of this model is supported by photoemission experiments@xcite and _ ab initio _ computations , in which the inaccuracies of the lsda are partly reduced by self - interaction.@xcite furthermore , the magnitude of low - temperature quantum corrections to conductivity indicates that in the concentration range relevant to ferromagnetism , the density of states assumes values expected for valence band holes.@xcite the carrier band is formed from @xmath14-type - like states of the gaas semiconductor structure , which are mostly built from the anion @xmath15 orbitals , but has a rather large @xmath16 component as the result of a strong @xmath17 interaction .",
    "we describe it by the @xmath1 tight - binding approximation for thin layers and , by applying periodic boundary conditions , for bulk crystals.@xcite our analysis of the anomalous hall effect in ( ga , mn)as in refs .   and",
    "provides a thorough comparison of this method with other band structure models.@xcite one of its advantages is that it captures the inversion asymmetry of the zinc - blende lattice , which produces the dresselhaus spin splitting of the conduction band,@xcite and additionally the structure inversion asymmetry in thin layers , which creates the bychkov - rashba spin splitting.@xcite the growth - induced biaxial strain is included by changing the atoms arrangement , according to the strain tensor values : @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the strain - induced change of the lattice constant , and @xmath21 is the ratio of elastic moduli .",
    "also , the on - site energies of the @xmath16 orbitals depend linearly on the strain tensor values.@xcite the @xmath17 exchange coupling is modelled using the virtual crystal and mean - field approximations , while taking into account the appropriate weights of ga and as orbitals in the wavefunctions close to the center of the brillouin zone.@xcite in this way , spin polarization of individual mn moments is replaced by a molecular field , which creates a @xmath22-dependent zeeman - like splitting of the host bands . for heavy holes in the @xmath23 point",
    "it is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fraction of cation site density @xmath26 substituted by mn forming a spin @xmath27 , and @xmath28  mevnm@xmath29 is the @xmath0 exchange integral.@xcite the validity of this approach can be questioned if the magnetic ions produce bound states,@xcite but the metallic character of the carrier states of interest here means that this does not occur due to many - body screening . at the same time we neglect the effect of this screening on potentials produced by magnetization fluctuations , which is justified as long as @xmath30 is smaller than the fermi energy , so that spin and charge density fluctuations are decoupled .",
    "a part of mn atoms form unintentional defects such as interstitials ( which can passivate single substitutional spins ) and antisites . both being double donors , they significantly lower the hole density , which can be partly remedied by removing the interstitials by post - growth annealing .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : theoreticalmodel ] we use the proposed variational - perturbation calculus to describe the system of lattice spins interacting via hole carriers , and its spin - wave excitations . in the micromagnetic theory ,",
    "the system is described by the set of constants related to magnetocrystalline anisotropy and exchange energy .",
    "section  [ sec : exchange ] provides quantitative results on the spin - wave stiffness expressed as the dimensionless parameter @xmath31 , comparing it between the @xmath2 and @xmath1 tight - binding models . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : magntemp ] we derive the spin - wave contribution to magnetization and curie temperature . section  [ sec : experimental ] compares our theory to related experimental findings.@xcite the last section of the paper contains the summary of our work .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate a physically transparent perturbation - variational method of treating the systems in question .",
    "we use it to find the effective hamiltonian of lattice ions interacting through hole carriers , written in the _ interaction representation _ of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "next , we calculate the dispersion dependence of its low lying energy states by transforming the hamiltonian to the _ spin - wave representation_. these two pictures are associated with different sets of phenomenological parameters describing the macroscopic system , whose properties we shall investigate later on .",
    "we consider the ferromagnetic phase of a system consisting of @xmath32 carriers and @xmath33 magnetic lattice ions , described by the hamiltonian @xmath34 and coupled by the @xmath0 exchange interaction @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the @xmath39-th carrier s and @xmath40-th ion s spin operators , while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are their respective positions .",
    "the strength of the @xmath0 exchange interaction between these two spins is described by a smooth function @xmath43 , localized around the @xmath40-th magnetic ion . in the absence of external fields ,",
    "@xmath34 depends on the carriers degrees of freedom only.@xcite    the dynamics of magnetic ions coupled to the system of hole carriers requires a self - consistent description , which takes into account how the holes react to the ions magnetization changes .",
    "therefore , we use the lwdin perturbation method specifically adapted for multiparticle hamiltonians,@xcite to derive an effective hamiltonian @xmath44 for ions only .",
    "we choose the multiparticle basis states of @xmath45 as @xmath46 .",
    "the ion part @xmath47 is an eigenstate of the unperturbed ions - holes system  , and the hole part @xmath23 is a slater determinant of eigenstates of the one - particle hole hamiltonian @xmath48 where @xmath49 describes the host band structure and @xmath30 is the spin splitting induced by polarized lattice ions .",
    "the lwdin calculus consists in dividing the multiparticle basis states into two subsets , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 set @xmath50 contains all states @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the @xmath32-particle ground state of @xmath55 .",
    "set @xmath51 contains all the remaining states , in which at least one hole is excited above the fermi level .",
    "we construct the effective hamiltonian for the states from set @xmath50 only , adding their coupling with set @xmath51 as the second order perturbation , @xmath56 where @xmath57 . the term @xmath58 is independent of the ion configurations , so we set it to zero for simplicity .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonian @xmath44 depends only on the ion degrees of freedom but , thanks to the lwdin method , takes hole excitations into account and can be used to calculate the spin - wave dispersion in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the variational part of our method consists in searching for the energy @xmath59 in the range where we expect to find the lowest eigenenergies of @xmath45 , which are the ones that we are interested in .",
    "for a known average spin splitting @xmath30 , we can set @xmath59 to the total energy of the hole multiparticle state @xmath54 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the energy of the band with wave vector @xmath62 of hamiltonian @xmath55 , and the sum goes over all occupied eigenstates @xmath63 in @xmath54",
    ". the states @xmath64 are of the form @xmath65 , @xmath66 . to simplify the sum over @xmath64 , we approximate the diagonal matrix element @xmath67 , which depends on both @xmath47 and @xmath68 , by the total energy of the multiparticle hole state @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "it describes the interaction of @xmath68 with the average configuration of the ions spins corresponding to the spin splitting @xmath30 .",
    "we can thus write the hamiltonian   in the following form : @xmath70 the factor @xmath71 under the sum can be written as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . since the denominator in eq .",
    "is independent of @xmath75 , summing over @xmath75 is equivalent to inserting an identity operator , which allows us to write the last term as @xmath76 we can thus treat @xmath44 as a hamiltonian acting on ion states only , @xmath77    since the @xmath0 exchange term in @xmath78 , which produces the extra - diagonal matrix element @xmath79 , is the interaction of a single hole with an ion , the only @xmath68 states which have a non - zero contribution to the sum over @xmath68 in eq .",
    "are those which are created from @xmath54 by just one excitation , @xmath80 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath81 and hamiltonian   can be written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the fermi - dirac distribution coefficient .",
    "the fraction in the above sum looks dangerous , as it may diverge in the presence of the energy bands crossings , which would make our perturbation calculus invalid .",
    "however , the effective hamiltonian for ions depends on the average of these factors , and will be shown immune to this problem .",
    "we write hamiltonian   using ion spin operators and integrate out the hole degrees of freedom : @xmath84 the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 are given by @xmath87 where due to the condition @xmath66 in eq .",
    ", for @xmath88 the summation goes over @xmath89 , and @xmath90 where @xmath91 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 = \\hat s^z$ ] by convention . to obtain the above expressions",
    ", we substituted the hole - only part of hamiltonian @xmath94   by the sum of @xmath32 one - particle hamiltonians @xmath49 from eq .  .",
    "we also used the formula @xmath95 .",
    "it arises from the fact that the bloch states @xmath96 building the multiparticle hole states @xmath23 are one - particle eigenstates of hamiltonian @xmath55  , which includes spin splitting @xmath30 . assuming that @xmath97 is a slowly - varying function of @xmath98 and @xmath99 is constant within the unit cell around the @xmath40-th ion and vanishes outside of it , we obtained @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the crystal volume .",
    "the second term of @xmath44   describes the exchange interaction between the lattice ions . in the presence of the spin - orbit coupling it has an antisymmetric part in form of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the antisymmetric levi - civita symbol with @xmath104 , while @xmath105 is a pseudovector and exists only in the systems with broken inversion symmetry , @xmath106    using the lwdin perturbation - variational calculus , we have thus described the problem as a lattice spin system coupled by exchange interaction",
    "the low - lying energy states of such systems are wavelike and can be modeled in the small oscillations approximation .",
    "for this purpose , we replace the spin operators with certain nonlinear functions of bosonic creation and annihilation operators @xmath107 and @xmath108 , carrying out the holstein - primakoff bosonization.@xcite next , we approximate these functions with their power expansions around the state of saturation magnetization : @xmath109 leaving in the hamiltonian the terms which are quadratic in creation and annihilation operators , as only these terms influence the dispersion relation .",
    "this approximation works very well in the long - wave limit , @xmath110 , as the neglected magnon - magnon interactions are proportional to @xmath111.@xcite furthermore , it justifies neglecting any short - range interactions between localized spins . at the same time , the continuous medium approximation becomes valid , which allows us to carry out the fourier transform @xmath112 .",
    "after simple algebraic transformations , we arrive at the final form of the harmonic hamiltonian , @xmath113 \\ . \\end{split}\\ ] ] we call it the _ interaction _ representation as it describes the perturbation of the ground state by the isotropic coulomb interaction ( first term ) and by the spin - orbit interaction , coupling modes of different @xmath114 ( remaining terms ) .",
    "the spin susceptibility of the holes is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the density of localized spins @xmath117 in the sample volume @xmath101 and @xmath118 .",
    "the presence of the energy denominator shows that @xmath119 corresponds to the second - order part of the hamiltonian  .",
    "as promised , vanishing of the denominator is not harmful , due to the de lhospital rule .",
    "the formula   implies that @xmath120 is symmetric in @xmath114 , while @xmath121 , @xmath122 inherit the symmetry of the @xmath123 eigenstates .",
    "hence , we expect the latter to be symmetric with respect to @xmath114 for systems which preserve space inversion symmetry,@xcite and otherwise for systems which do not .",
    "the @xmath114-independent term describes the interaction of a single magnetic ion with a molecular field arising from the intraband spin polarization of the carriers , @xmath124 the corresponding term reflecting the interband polarization , @xmath125 arises from both @xmath86   and the second part of @xmath85 coefficient  , and cancels exactly in the full hamiltonian @xmath126 .",
    "hamiltonian   in the interaction representation describes the spin system in terms of circularly polarized plane waves ( first term ) , which interact with each other and deform in time ( remaining terms ) .",
    "we want to obtain the dispersion relation of independent , stable magnons . for this purpose",
    ", we diagonalize @xmath126 by the bogoliubov transformation from @xmath127 to @xmath128 operators , keeping in mind that we deal with the system which breaks the space inversion symmetry . the final form of the effective hamiltonian in the _ spin - wave _ representation reads @xmath129 where excitation modes are spin waves with dispersion @xmath130 in the case of @xmath131 , fulfilled for the systems invariant under space inversion , the above formula simplifies to knig s  _ _ et al.__@xcite solution , @xmath132 furthermore , neglecting the spin - orbit coupling , when @xmath133 , bogoliubov transformation is unnecessary , and the effective hamiltonian is already diagonalized by @xmath127 operators .",
    "the negative sign of the hamiltonian   is a consequence of using the electronic convention to describe the hole - ion system .    apart from spin waves , which are the eigenstates of the stationary hamiltonian @xmath126 , dynamic excitations of different physical origin may occur ( e.g.  stoner spin - flips ) .",

    "we have estimated the effective mn content @xmath326 from the measured low - temperature magnetization @xmath350 , and then increased it by about @xmath351 to include the hole contribution.@xcite assuming that annealing removed all interstitials and each remaining substitutional mn produces one hole carrier , the hole density @xmath352 .",
    "for the obtained values of @xmath14 and @xmath326 we have calculated the mean - field curie temperatures @xmath239 and the exchange constant @xmath353 assuming that mn ions form a cubic lattice .",
    "we note that this form is equivalent up to a few percent to that employed in ref .  :",
    "@xmath354 , where @xmath25 is the total mn content ( n.  samarth , private communication ) .",
    "since for the samples with low mn content our values of @xmath239 are much lower than the experimental ones , we conclude that the corresponding estimates of @xmath346 ( indicated by empty circles ) are not reliable . on the other hand ,",
    "we reconstruct curie temperatures for samples with @xmath355 ( filled circles ) , but this time the theoretical values of @xmath346 are much smaller than the experimental ones .",
    "this discrepancy points to the importance of the anisotropy - induced energy gap in the spin - wave spectrum . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure11 ] ( inset ) for the sample with @xmath347 , fitting the experimental @xmath234 curves with the standard bloch law neglecting the gap leads to higher values of @xmath346 than those expected theoretically . at the same time",

    "the spin - wave stiffness was determined by examining spin precession modes excited by optical pulses@xcite and under ferromagnetic resonance conditions.@xcite according to these works , the experimental findings are strongly affected by gradients of magnetic anisotropy , presumably associated with carrier depletion at the surface and interface , which also affect the character of spin pinning .",
    "we also note that no influence of the magnetic field on the hole spins , visible as a deviation of the land factor from the value @xmath356,@xcite was taken into account in the employed landau - lifshitz equations . with these reservations",

    "computations@xcite ( dashed line ) and our theory for the hole concentration @xmath357 and @xmath358 ( solid lines ) .",
    "when comparing theoretical and experimental results , one should take into account that the actual mn concentration @xmath326 is smaller than @xmath25 , particularly in as - grown samples .",
    "as seen , our theory describes properly the order of magnitude of the spin - wave stiffness @xmath238 but can not account for a rather large dispersion in the experimental data .     as a function of the nominal mn concentration @xmath25 in ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as .",

    "it leads to the formation of a cycloidal spin structure and uniaxial in - plane anisotropy of the [ 110 ] and @xmath218 $ ] directions , with the easy axis determined by the sample geometry .",
    "both these phenomena have been a subject of considerable interest in recent years.@xcite while the long - period spin structures have not been hitherto observed , the uniaxial anisotropy is commonly present in ( ga , mn)as.@xcite however , it was shown by gradual etching@xcite or by investigating different samples@xcite to be insensitive to the layer thickness .",
    "this is not the case for the anisotropy caused by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , which is a surface effect and vanishes with increasing layer thickness . to test our theory",
    ", one should pick very thin high - quality samples grown in the [ 001 ] direction , which additionally excludes the anisotropy of the surface , with the easy axis along one of the in - plane diagonal directions .",
    "the cycloidal spin structure could be then observed e.g. under a magnetic force microscope or by neutron scattering .",
    "the sample should be probed along the [ 110 ] and @xmath218 $ ] directions to find the long - period modulation of magnetization only along the one perpendicular to the easy axis .",

    "we have described the analyzed systems and their spin - wave excitations .",
    "their properties have been expressed by the phenomenological parameters of micromagnetic theory .",
    "we have noticed that the strength of ferromagnetic order described by the isotropic exchange stiffness is significantly amplified by the @xmath14-like character of carrier wave functions , as compared to the simple parabolic band model .",
    "furthermore , we have found various effects reflecting the tendency of the spin - orbit interaction to pervade every aspect of carrier dynamics .",
    "they produce the relativistic corrections to spin - waves given by the anisotropic exchange stiffness tensor and the asymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya coefficient .",
    "the latter accounts for the cycloidal spin arrangement and the accompanying uniaxial in - plane anisotropy of diagonal ( [ 110]/@xmath218 $ ] ) directions in thin layers , which can result in a surface - like anisotropy in thicker films . quantitative results on the stiffness constant have been provided in form of a normalized parameter , which assumes the value @xmath359 over a wide range of mn and hole concentrations in ( ga , mn)as .",
    "they agree with the previous @xmath2 calculations@xcite but predict significantly smaller values of spin - wave stiffness than those resulting from _ ab initio _",
    "computations.@xcite    the above theories have been applied to analyze the related experimental data on the stiffness parameter and the temperature dependence of magnetization .",
