    "the structure of light nuclei near the neutron drip - line is one of the interesting topic for a good number of exotic phenomena .",
    "nuclei in this region are quite different in collectivity and clustering features than the stable counterpart in the nuclear chart . for example , the neutron magic property is lost for n = 8 in @xmath5be @xcite and n = 20 in @xmath6 mg @xcite .",

    "@xcite is another example of such exotic properties .",
    "the deformed structures , core excitation and the location of drip - line for mg and neighboring nuclei are few of the interesting properties of investigation . in this context , the discovery of @xmath0 mg and @xmath1al , once predicted to be nuclei beyond the drip - line by various mass formulae @xcite show to need the modification of the mass models .    on the other hand , the appearance of n = 16 as magic number in @xmath9o and the existence of neutron halo in @xmath10li are established observations @xcite . however , the proposed proton @xcite ( @xmath11b ) and neutron @xcite halo ( @xmath12be , @xmath13b , @xmath14ne ) in the exotic nuclei are currently under investigations .",
    "in addition to these , the cluster structure of entire the light mass nuclei and the skin formation in neutron - drip isotopes motivate us for the study of light mass drip - line nuclei . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to study the neutron drip - line for ne@xmath15s isotopic chain in the frame - work of a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) and nonrelativistic skyrme hartree - fock ( shf ) formalisms and analyzed the features of large quadrupole deformation of these isotopes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the rmf and shf formalisms are described briefly in section ii .",

    "the deformation becomes negligible for @xmath64ne and we do not get the experimental deformation parameter in rmf calculations . with no pairing ,",
    "we reproduce substantially the deformation parameter in rmf because the _ density of states _ near fermi surface for such light nuclei are small and not conducive to pairing @xcite . to understand the influence of pairing on the open shell nuclei , we have taken into account the experimental data , wherever available .",
    "the shf(ski4 ) results are used as guideline in the absence of these data",
    ". we realized after comparing the calculated @xmath66 of rmf and shf with experimental data that the quadrupole deformation of shf is closer to experiment without taking pairing correlation into account .",

    "similar effects are also seen in other considered isotopes . on the other hand , if we ignore pairing , then the calculated results are often better and these @xmath66 are quite close to the experimental data .",

    "is found with and without taking pairing correlation into account in rmf formalism .",

    "we discus some clear and important characteristics of superdeformed solutions ( @xmath75 or more ) obtained in mean field models as compared to the normal solutions of smaller deformation .",
    "since the lowering and occupation of the deformation - driving @xmath76 orbits from the shell above the usual valence space is so important in producing superdeformation we have emphasized their role in this discussion .",
    "there is the occurrence of @xmath3 , @xmath4 orbits close together in energy ( doublets ) below and near the fermi surface of the self - consistent superdeformed solutions .",
    "this feature also occurs broadly in nilsson orbits at asymptotically large prolate deformations ( see the nilsson diagrams in bohr and mottelson vol . ii @xcite ) .      in normal deformed case ,",
    "the deformed orbits of a major shell form a `` band''-like set of orbits , distinctly separated from the major shell above and below ( see fig .",
    "[ al ] for @xmath65al ( @xmath77=0.09 ) and @xmath74al ( @xmath77 = 0.125 ) ) .",
    "thus physical states obtained from such intrinsic states of low deformation will be well separated in energy from those intrinsic states where excitation occurs across a major shell ( a single nucleon excitation across a major shell means a change in parity and significant energy change for small deformation ) .",
    "the above mentioned `` band''-like separation of orbits of major shells of unique parity is quite lost in the case of superdeformation ( see fig .",
    "[ al ] , @xmath77=0.653 of @xmath65al and @xmath77=0.660 of @xmath74al ) .",
    "the `` band''-like orbits now spread in energy ( both downward and upward ) and orbits of successive major shells come closer to each other in energy ; an inter - mingling of orbits of different parities ( see figs . [ mg ] , [ al ] ) .",
    "this is a significant structural change from the case of small deformation .",
    "this has also been seen in the case of @xmath78zr in hartree - fock study @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in the self - consistent models ( skyrme - hf and rmf ) the deformation of the nucleus is the result of the deformation of the self - consistently occupied individual orbits : @xmath79 the occupation of the more deformation driving orbits from the shell above the valence space and the unoccupation of oblate driving orbits ( e.g. @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) contribute much to configuration mixing and the lowering of @xmath82 orbits and to generation of the quadrupole deformation .",
    "because of coming together in energy of @xmath83 and @xmath4 orbits , it is easy to see that superdeformed intrinsic states of two different parities for a particular k quantum number can be formed which will be close to each other in energy",
    ". this will lead to parity doublets in band structures . for the neutron - rich nuclei",
    "being discussed here , the protons are quite well bound and possible low energy excitations will be those of neutrons near the fermi surface . @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the k quantum numbers for proton and neutron configurations ( k=@xmath85 + @xmath86 ) .",
    "we illustrate schematically possible parity doublet of configurations for neutrons in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] , the proton configuration @xmath87 being fixed .",
    "we show here the last few neutron occupations of superdeformed solutions and rearrangements near the fermi surface . in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] , ( b ) and ( c ) are parity doublet of configurations .",
    "@xmath88 transition between ( b ) and ( c ) configurations is of odd parity multipole nature .",
    "thus , in summary , we find a systematic behaviour of the low @xmath2 ( particularly @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) prolate deformed orbits for the superdeformed solutions .",
    "we notice ( from the plot of the orbits ) that there is occurrence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbits very close to each other in energy for the superdeformed ( sd ) shape .",
    "such @xmath3 , @xmath4 degenerate orbits occur not only for the well - bound orbits but also for the unbound states .",
    "for example , the doublet of neutron orbits @xmath89\\frac{1}{2}^+$ ] and @xmath90\\frac{1}{2}^-$ ] are @xmath91 mev apart from each other in the normal deformed prolate solutions ; but they become degenerate in the superdeformed ( sd ) solutions ( shown by * in figs .",
    "[ mg ] and [ al ] for mg , al ) .",
    "more such doublets are easily identified ( figs .",
    "[ mg ] and [ al ] ) for superdeformed solutions of @xmath92 mg and @xmath93al .",
    "in fact it is noticed that the @xmath94 states of unique parity , seen clearly well separated in energy from the usual parity orbits in the normal deformed solutions , occurs closer to them in energy for the sd states , showing a degenerate parity doublet structure .",
    "in fact , for sd solution the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbits are intermixed in the energy plot ; while for the normal deformation they occur in distinct groups .",
    "this is true both in the skyrme hartree fock and the rmf calculations .",
    "this can be seen by examining the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbits for small and large deformations in fig .",
    "this can lead to parity mixing and octupole deformed shapes for the sd structures @xcite .",
    "parity doublets and octupole deformation for superdeformed solutions have been discussed for @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "there is much interest for the experimental study of the spectra of neutron - rich nuclei in this mass region @xcite .",
    "the highly deformed structures for the neutron - rich ne - na - mg - al nuclei are interesting and signature of such superdeformed configurations ( with parity doublet structure ) should be looked for .     with parity doublet of occupied orbits @xmath96 , @xmath97 ( having m= @xmath98 1/2 and + ve and -ve parities ) and",
    "an unoccupied orbits b possible occupation of neutrons are shown in configurations ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the two excited configurations ( b ) and ( c ) have the same @xmath86 value and represent two excited bands of different parities ( parity doublet ) .",
    "such situation can occur for neutron configurations in superdeformed @xmath65al and @xmath6 mg , @xmath8 mg ( figs .",
    "[ al ] , [ mg ] ) . ]",
    "in summary , we calculate the ground and low - lying excited state properties , like binding energy and quadrupole deformation @xmath66 using rmf(nl3 ) formalism for ne , na , mg , si , p and s isotopes , near the neutron drip - line region . in general",
    ", we find large deformed solutions for the neutron - drip nuclei which agree well with the experimental measurement .",
    "the calculation is also repeated in the frame - work of nonrelativistic hartree - fock formalism with skyrme interaction ski4 .",
    "both the relativistic and non - relativistic results are comparable to each other for the considered mass region . in the present calculations a large number of low - lying intrinsic superdeformed excited states are predicted in many of the isotopes and some of them are reported . from binding energy point of view , i.e. the sudden fall in @xmath99 value , the breaking of n = 28 magic number and the likely appearance of a new magic number at n = 34 noticed in our non - relativistic calculations , in contrast with rmf finding .",
    "this is an indication of more binding than the neighbouring isotopes .",
    "however to confirm n = 34 as a magic /non - magic number more calculations are needed .",
    "a deformed nucleus has a collective low lying @xmath100 state .",
    "also , a spherical nucleus can have a fairly low lying collective @xmath100 state ( e.g. sn nuclei ) because of quadrupole collectivity . in this study",
    "we find that , for the sd shape , the low @xmath2 orbits ( particularly @xmath94 ) become more bound and nearly degenerate with the orbits of opposite parity , i.e. they show a parity doublet structure .",
    "closely lying parity - doublet band structures and enhanced odd parity multipole transitions are possible for the superdeformed shapes .",
