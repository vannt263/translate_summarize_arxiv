    "such a large measured braking index is contamination from timing noise .",

    "timing noise in radio pulsars has been observed to be spectrally ` red ' , that is , having most power at low frequencies @xcite . as such",
    ", it can contaminate measurements of @xmath8 , and thus @xmath6 @xcite . the power spectral density ( psd ) of timing noise is often modeled as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the spectral density amplitude , @xmath44 the corner frequency , and @xmath45 the power - law index @xcite .",
    "a @xmath45 of 0 represents a white noise power spectrum , whereas indices of 2 , 4 , and 6 represent random walks in pulse arrival phase , the pulse frequency , and frequency derivative , respectively .",
    "to quantify the probability of timing noise biasing our measurement of the braking index , we conducted a series of simulations that aimed to determine whether any reasonable form of red noise artificially results in a measurement of @xmath46 , given the observed ( i.e. white ) noise properties of the resulting timing residuals .",
    "as timing noise in real pulsars can have psds with many indices we created @xmath47 realizations of red noise and injected them into simulated pulsar toas , with toa uncertainties , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 identical to that of the pulsar , but with a braking index of @xmath29 .    to do this we used the simrednoise plug - in of tempo2 .",
    "we simulated parameters on a grid , drawing 10 iterations from each set of parameters .",
    "we simulated @xmath43 ranging from * @xmath48@xmath49*s@xmath50yr@xmath31 with 20 log - spaced steps , @xmath45 between 06 with 25 linear steps , and @xmath44 from @xmath51@xmath52 yr@xmath31 in 20 log - space steps .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath43 was chosen to ensure phase connection was possible , as larger values of @xmath43 precluded phase connection more that 50% of the time , and hence are ruled out by our observations .",
    "after the noise injection , the new toas were fitted to the full timing model to measure @xmath6 , allowing @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath8 to vary .",
    "we considered any iterations where the @xmath25 value indicated that a probability of less than 1% ruled out by our measured residuals , as this would indicate unaccounted for noise .",
    "after this , only in @xmath53 of all the simulations could produce a braking index greater than three with the measured significance .",
    "the parameter regime which gave this highest probability of artificially producing a high braking index was when @xmath44 was of order the observing length with the highest values of @xmath43 .",
    "there is only a weak dependence on @xmath45 , with larger values producing more false positives .",
    "another way to check for the possible contamination of our measured value of @xmath6 by timing noise is by considering the third frequency derivative . in our data ,",
    "the third frequency derivative is consistent with zero at the @xmath54 level , we ran another suite of simulations within the parameter space described above wherein we fitted up to a third frequency derivative .",
    "we note that there is a covariance , with the second and third frequency derivatives being anti - correlated . only in @xmath55 of simulated sets of residuals",
    "can we reproduce a braking index significantly greater than three without having a detectable third frequency derivative .",
    "these simulations indicate that only a very low level of timing noise can be present in our data , and the measured braking index of @xmath0 is highly unlikely to be due to timing noise .",
    "we note that the assumed value of @xmath29 in our simulations is conservative , since when assuming @xmath56 , it is even less likely for timing noise to result in a measured @xmath46 .      in order to search for radio pulsations from psr  j16404631",
    ", we undertook observations with the 64-m parkes telescope .",
    "observations were performed in two sessions totaling 14.96 hours at the position of psr  j16404631 @xcite .",
    "data were taken by observing with the central beam of the 21 cm multi - beam receiver , using the bpsr pulsar backend .",
    "these observations were taken on 2014 april 18 and 2015 april 27 ( mjds 56765 and 56775 , respectively ) at center frequency 1382 mhz over 400 mhz of bandwidth , divided into 1024 channels .",
    "the data from each channel were detected and the two polarizations summed to form a time series with 64-@xmath57s samples .    we searched these data using the known pulsar spin frequency and frequency derivative from the phase - coherent timing analysis found in this article .",
    "we searched over 4704 dispersion measures between 0 and 1600pccm@xmath27 .",
    "no signal was found in these data , and so we quote an upper limit to the pulsar flux at this frequency , using the radiometer equation for the rms noise from the observing system : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the system temperature in kelvin , @xmath61 is the receiver gain in k / jy , @xmath62 is the number of polarizations , @xmath63 is the total integration time in seconds , and @xmath64 is the observing bandwidth in hz . from this , we calculate a @xmath1 upper flux limit of 0.018 mjy at 1.4ghz .",
    "this upper limit assumes a 50% duty cycle , with the upper limit scaling as @xmath65 , where dc is the duty cycle .",
    "this flux limit is low , but not unusually so , especially when one considers that the estimated distance to the source is @xmath6612  kpc .",
    "a possible contaminant to the measured braking index is a long - term recovery from an unseen glitch prior to our monitoring .",
    "if such a glitch occurred , a typical exponential recovery would , in general , cause an artificially high value for @xmath8 to be measured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , for pulsars with @xmath67yrs",
    ", there is a clear preference for positive @xmath8 , compared to older pulsars which are equally likely to have positive or negative @xmath68 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume an exponentially recovering glitch contaminating a constant braking index we can , from our upper limit of @xmath24 , place a lower limit on the decay timescale for such a glitch to be @xmath69{\\delta\\nu_d/10^{-8}\\mathrm{hz}}$]days , where @xmath70 is the size of the unseen decaying glitch . in @xcite , of the 107 glitches detected , 27 had a detected exponential recovery .",
    "of those , only 3 were longer than 200 days .",
    "we thus can not rule out contamination due to a prior unseen glitch recovery as an explanation for the high measured braking index , although the recovery time scale would have to be longer than most yet observed .",
    "ultimately this hypothesis can be tested by continued monitoring .",
    "measurements of braking indices could also be contaminated by uncertainties in the pulsar s position , or proper motion @xcite .",
    "the position of psr  j16404631 is well determined by _",
    "chandra _ to a 3@xmath23 error radius of 0.6  @xcite .",
    "this positional error at the ecliptic latitude of psr  j16404631 would add a 1.0ms root - mean - square signal to our timing residuals , far smaller than our measurement uncertainties .",
    "for psr  j16404631 s estimated distance of 813@xmath13kpc @xcite , and a typical pulsar kick velocity of 300kms@xmath31 @xcite , an unmodeled proper motion would change the measured braking index by less than one part in a million .",
    "thus neither of these effects can account for our measured braking index .",
    "the pulsar s high luminosity pwn has been argued to be powered by a relativistic outflow or wind from the neutron star . under this assumption ,",
    "predictions for the pulsar s spin - down history and hence braking index have been made @xcite .",
    "the 0.210@xmath13tev luminosity of the pwn powered by the source represents @xmath71 of the pulsar s current spin - down luminosity @xcite .",
    "a pulsar whose spin - down is driven solely by a particle wind would result in a braking index of one @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a combination of magnetic dipole radiation and wind braking would result in a braking index with value between one and three . in this case , the braking index as a function of @xmath72 , the fraction of spin - down power due to a particle wind , is given by @xcite @xmath73 this implies a maximal expected braking index of @xmath6=2.89 for psr  j16404631 .",
    "indeed , a more thorough modeling of the pulsar and pwn system suggested an even smaller braking index , @xmath74 @xcite , clearly at odds with our result .    a changing magnetic field has also been put forth as a possibility for a braking index that is different from three by the growth or decay of the field @xcite , or a change in the angle between the magnetic and rotation axes@xcite . in this case , @xmath6 is given by : @xmath75 for the decaying field case , this would imply a magnetic field decay rate of @xmath76 mg per century .",
    "this decay rate is very close to that predicted in some magneto - thermal evolutionary models @xcite , and in this interpretation might be providing direct observational evidence of a decaying magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "population synthesis studies find no strong evidence for field decay in the radio pulsar population as a whole @xcite .",
    "if a change in the alignment angle between the magnetic and rotational axes is the cause of the anomalous braking index then either @xmath77 is less than @xmath78 and the rotation and magnetic axes are moving towards alignment , or @xmath77 is greater than @xmath78 and the rotation and magnetic axes are counter - aligning . if @xmath77 is changing on order of the rate of the crab pulsar @xcite , the only pulsar for which such a change has been measured , at @xmath79 per century , this would imply that @xmath77 is @xmath80 away from being an orthogonal rotator .",
    "this is at odds with the pulse profile being single peaked , since an orthogonal rotator would typically be seen to have emission as each pole enters our line of sight . in general ,",
    "the value of @xmath77 for pulsars can be independently determined by modeling of the gamma - ray or radio pulse profiles .",
    "psr  j16404631 , however , is radio quiet , see  [ sec : radio ] .",
    "there are also no detected gamma - ray pulsations from psr  j16404631 @xcite , and so the value of @xmath77 is unknown for this source .",
    "another possibility to explain a braking index greater than three is to invoke higher order multipoles @xcite .",
    "a pure quadrupole , either a magnetic quadrupole , or a mass quadrupole leading to gravitational radiation @xcite , would yield a braking index of 5 , and could coexist with the magnetic dipole to give a braking index between 3 and 5 .",
    "analogous to the case of a wind , the fraction of spin down due to a quadrupole versus a dipole , @xmath81 is : @xmath82 in our case , this implies @xmath83 of the spin down is due to quadrupolar radiation . in the case of a mass quadrupole , this would imply that the pulsar has an ellipticity of @xmath84 , which can not be reproduced by theoretically proposed dense matter equations of state , for a neutron star rotating at 4.84hz @xcite .",
    "if such an ellipticity did exist , it would produce gravitational waves having a maximum strain of @xmath85 at twice the spin - period of the pulsar , which is far below the detection sensitivity of current technology .",
    "the existence of a magnetic quadrupole is in principle testable with future x - ray polarimeter missions .",
    "x - ray polarization measurements of neutron stars are in principle sensitive to the magnetospheric configuration , @xcite be it a quadrupolar field structure or a change in the alignment of the spin and magnetic poles .",
    "the specific magnetic field structure of pulsars has a strong impact on the inferred magnetic field strength , as well as predicted radio and gamma - ray pulse profiles @xcite .",
    "thus x - ray polarimetric observations of psr  j16404631 could help us understand the origin of the pulsar s high @xmath6 , and shed light on the range of possibilities of neutron - star magnetic field structure .    since the first measurement of the crab s braking index in 1972 @xcite , we have known that various physical mechanisms , such as angular momentum loss due to a wind , can result in a pulsar braking index less than the canonical dipole value .",
    "our results for psr  j16404631 now show that other physics , such as the quadrupole moment of the magnetic field , affect the evolution of this source , and likely rotation - powered pulsars , in general .",
    "given that two other young , high - magnetic field pulsars have experienced glitches that resulted in a significant drop in the braking index @xcite , it is clear that continuous study of braking indices provides an important window into additional physical processes at work in the youngest and most energetic of neutron stars .",
