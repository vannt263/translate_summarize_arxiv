    "in the main text , we argue that the upper bound of the energy cost associated with controlling a complex network can be very large , because even the optimal control route of steering the whole network from some initial state to the origin ( zero state ) is in general highly circuitous , though smooth . here",
    "we provide numerical result of the optimal route for a simple directed network used in @xcite : @xmath133 figure [ routes ] shows that , when steering the network from @xmath134 to the desired state @xmath135 in the allowed time range @xmath136 $ ] , the optimal route is indeed not direct ( dashed line ) but smooth and circuitous ( @xmath91 ) . for undirected networks ,",
    "we obtain similar highly circuitous optimal routes ( not shown here ) .     to the desired state @xmath137 in the allowed time range [ 0,1 ] .",
    "as we stated in the main text , the constant value @xmath105 of energy cost in eq .",
    "( 8) is the inverse of smallest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix @xmath112 with elements @xmath138 .",
    "although it is difficult , if not impossible , to estimate the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath112 , we can obtain some indications from the viewpoint of correlations between nodes . when nodes are more structurally similar , they tend to have more similar dynamical correlations with other nodes so that corresponding columns and rows in @xmath112 become more similar . as a consequence , the smallest eigenvalue will be less and @xmath112 tend to be ill - conditioned so that the upper bound of control energy cost increases drastically .    because the energy cost of controlling a network depends not only on the network topology but also on the link weights and nodal dynamics , for the convenience of comparing the impacts of network structures on the control cost , one may set the networks with equal size , edge numbers , but different degree distributions , and set all nodal dynamics as a function of node - degrees .",
    "at this situation , when two nodes are _ structural equivalent _ , the network can not be controllable by any other driver node . here _ structural equivalent _ is defined for any two nodes @xmath75 and @xmath139 with the same degree as follows : nodes @xmath75 and @xmath139 are structural equivalent if and only if there exists a nontrivial automorphism @xmath140 of the network  @xcite such that @xmath141 . more apparently , take unweighted undirected networks for example , denote the neighbor - set of any node @xmath10 by @xmath142 , nodes @xmath75 and @xmath139 are structural equivalent if any of the following conditions are satisfied : + 1 .",
    "@xmath143 , or + 2 .",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath139 are connected with each other and @xmath144 , or + 3 .",
    "@xmath145 , @xmath146 such that @xmath147 or @xmath148 and @xmath149 are connected with each other and @xmath150 , or + 4 .",
    "higher - order neighbors of @xmath75 and @xmath139 meet condition 3 .",
    "therefore , for randomized networks , the probability of that any two nodes are structural equivalent can provide hints for the energy cost of controlling them : the larger the probability , the more the energy needed for controlling .",
    "we here focus on the probabilities of the most possible conditions 1 and 2 , and ignore the high - order probabilities of conditions 3 and 4 .",
    "we will derive the probability of that two nodes are structural equivalent for a randomized network with degree distribution @xmath151 . for a randomized network , two nodes @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath52 are connected with the probability @xmath152 , where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the degrees of nodes @xmath10 and @xmath52 respectively , @xmath155 is the average degree and @xmath1 is the network size .",
    "thus the probability of two nodes @xmath75 and @xmath139 with the same degree @xmath156 have the same neighbors is @xmath157 as the degree @xmath153 of node @xmath10 is generated from the distribution @xmath151 independently , the expectation value of @xmath158 can be obtained as @xmath159dk_1dk_2\\ldots dk_{n-2}$ ] where the integrations begin at the smallest degree @xmath160 and end at the largest degree @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath162 where @xmath163 . for",
    "the condition 2 mentioned above , one can obtain similar result .",
    "thus , when @xmath164 , the larger the factor @xmath165 , the larger the expectation value @xmath166 .    from the result one can expect that controlling randomized barabsi - albert networks need much more energy than controlling erds - rnyi networks , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> , we have reduced the complexity of the fundamental problem of control cost from the complicated and intractable gramian matrix to the simple system matrix which is directly related to the network structure . our results have revealed that energy cost of controlling complex networks has different scaling behaviors with control time in two time scales , separated by the characteristic time , @xmath126 and @xmath127 for the lower and the upper bound respectively . in the small - time regime , setting a relatively longer time for control always leads to less energy cost . </S>",
    "<S> while , in the large - time regime , there exists the situation where we can not reduce the energy cost even given much more time . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our results indicate that the lower ( upper ) bound of energy cost is less when controlling a randomized network with heterogeneous ( homogeneous ) node - degrees . </S>",
    "<S> these implications are important when considering the trade - off between the energy cost and the control time , which may find applications not only for classical @xcite but also for biological @xcite and quantum @xcite networks . </S>",
