    "the photometric works on globular clusters ( gcs ) , very often , do not include the @xmath12 band observations .",
    "the @xmath12band , however , is very important since it provides a comparatively long  base colour index @xmath6 , which removes the degeneracy in hb colours for @xmath13 and is also the most sensitive temperature parameter for early type stars in the @xmath0 system ( buser & kurucz 1978 ) .",

    "we draw special attention to stars occupying the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) .",
    "the distribution of these stars poses a number of questions that are still open and need further investigation as e.g. : the presence of a gap in the bhb ; the ultraviolet deficiency of some bhb stars ; the real location of the bluest hb stars on the @xmath15 diagram . in the following",
    "we present the observational material and reduction procedures ( sect.2 ) .",
    "the @xmath3diagrams are analysed in sect .",
    "the main topics in this section are the presence of a gap , the @xmath3-bright star candidates and the discrepancy between the observed bhb and the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) model .",

    "arp s photoelectric and 3 secondary photometric standard stars , taken from richer and fahlman ( 1987 ) , were used .",
    "the calibration into @xmath23 standard system was performed in two steps .",
    "first , we used the ccd observations to calibrate @xmath24 instrumental magnitudes with respect to the primary standard stars in m92 ( christian et al .",
    "then , 86 stars common for photographic and ccd measurements were used as a local secondary standard to calibrate all other program stars .",
    "the mean internal errors are in the range of @xmath25 . the total error including the uncertainties in the photoelectric data is @xmath26 in the stellar magnitudes and @xmath27 in the colour indices .",

    "two features of this diagram are worth noting : the bhb in this plane is not as steep as that in @xmath32 ( fig .",

    "following hawarden ( 1971 ) and newell ( 1973 ) , we tested the significance of the gap by means of @xmath44 statistics applied to the cumulative distribution and found that the gap is statistically significant at the 99.93 per cent level .",
    "however , catelan et al . ( 1998 ) have recently argued that the hawarden - newell technique substantially overestimates the probability that the gap is real .",
    "this result together with the fact that only 80 per cent ( 228 stars ) of all observed hb stars have been involved in our analysis make the reality of the gap not convincing enough .",

    "( 1995 ) and drissen & shara ( 1998 ) . in the @xmath105 diagram , the gap is visible at @xmath106 and @xmath35 .",
    "although the high statistical significance of this bhb feature , we consider the question of its reality still uncertain and will discuss it elsewhere ( baev et al . , in press ) .",
    "the ultraviolet excess observed for rg stars , @xmath70 ( _ u ",
    "b_)@xmath107=0.178@xmath620.02 , is used to estimate the metallicity of the cluster . the value obtained in our study , @xmath108",
    ", confirms that derived by zinn & west ( 1984 ) , @xmath76 .",
    "6 stars are suspected as new @xmath3bright stars .",
    "the @xmath0 data for these stars are summarised in table 1 .",
    "4 .   in the @xmath109 diagram",
    "we find that the hottest bhb stars tend to lie above the canonical zahb at a temperature threshold @xmath110 .",
    "this resembles the effect observed for 14 globular clusters by grundahl et al .",
    "( 1998,1999 ) and called @xmath8jump. in our investigation , the bhb sample is considerably richer than those used by gclsa .",
    "this result on the other hand demonstrates the ability of johnson s @xmath0 to reproduce an effect observed by means of the str@xmath9mgren s photometry .",
    "ultraviolet deficiency is detected for cool bhb stars .",
    "based on kuruzc s ( 1992 ) atmospheric models , we interprete this effect as an indication for lower surface gravity for these stars . having in mind that @xmath8-jump demonstrated in gclsa is intimately connected to low gravities ( @xmath63jump )",
    "a conclusion could be drawn that two groups of bhb stars in m5 tend to show surface gravities lower than those predicted by existing zahb models .    finally , we would like to add few remarks concerning the nature of the ultraviolet deficiency and the jump .",
    "gclsa argued that a stellar atmosphere effect  radiative levitation of metals  rather than helium mixing , is the primary cause of the @xmath8- and @xmath63-jump phenomenon .",
    "one of their arguments against helium mixing is that the size of the jump and its location do not depend on a cluster s individuality .",
    "collecting data for ultraviolet deficiency in clusters with available @xmath0 data , we found that the magnitude of the deficiency varies from cluster to cluster ( table 2 ) while in some clusters it is not observed at all .",
    "these finds together with the results of gclsa allow us to suggest that the jump and the deficiency more likely have different nature .",
    "in addition , taking in view certain evidences for mixing processes in some m5 red giant stars ( based on spectral observations referenced in gclsa ) , we suppose that the ultraviolet deficiency might be a photometric signature of helium mixing .",
    "this draws a possible direction for a future ultraviolet deficiency investigation : to obtain a homogeneous set of ubv data for a large number of gcs and to study the relation of the cluster parameters to the characteristics of the deficiency ( if any ) .",
