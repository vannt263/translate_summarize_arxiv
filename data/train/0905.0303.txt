    "single - file diffusion ( sfd ) refers to the motion of particles in quasi - one - dimensional channels and pores which are so narrow that the particles are unable to pass each other .",
    "the exclusion of a mutual passage of the diffusing particles means that the sequence of particle labels does not change over time .",
    "sfd is encountered in many physical , chemical and biological systems , which include the molecular and atomic motion in zeolites and nanotubes , particle flows in microfluidic devices , ion transport in cell membranes , colloidal motion in narrow tubes , etc . @xcite .",
    "the main feature of sfd is that for diffusion time @xmath0 smaller than typical inter - particle collision time @xmath1 , the particles diffuse normally and satisfy fick s law with its mean - square displacement ( msd ) @xmath2",
    "^ 2\\right\\rangle$ ] given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "in other words , for @xmath5 , the motion is just ordinary brownian motion , which is a markov process .",
    "however , for @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sfd mobility . recall that diffusion that does not satisfy fick s law is known as anomalous diffusion with msd satisfying @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "it is called superdiffusion when @xmath11 , and subdiffusion when @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the long - time behavior of sfd belongs to anomalous subdiffusion , which is non - markovian , indicating the motion is correlated .",
    "note that sfd displays anomalous diffusion characteristics even when particle - channel interactions are not taken into account .",
    "another way to characterize sfd is through its probability density function ( or propagator ) @xmath13 .",
    "the probability of finding a particle at position @xmath14 at time @xmath0 , if it is initially at the origin , approaches the gaussian propagator after a long time : @xmath15 for @xmath5 , one has @xmath16 and for @xmath6 , @xmath17    the notion of sfd was first introduced by hodgkin and keynes @xcite who used it to describe the diffusion of ions through narrow channels in biological membranes .",
    "harris was first to provide a theoretical derivation of and for sfd based on statistical argument @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this result was obtained using various models and methods by several authors including levitt @xcite , fedders @xcite , van beijeren et al @xcite and krger @xcite .",
    "recently , there are also attempts to model sfd based on fractional diffusion equations and fractional langevin equations @xcite . despite of the numerous theoretical models and numerical simulations , experimental evidence for the occurrence of sfd was only obtained quite recently @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that there is a lack of ideal experimentally accessible single file systems .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to propose some stochastic processes to describe the sfd .",
    "we do not address the detailed mechanism of sfd , but instead we emphasize more on the possibility of finding random processes which have the basic properties of sfd . various types of fractional langevin equations are considered in order to see whether they yield the stochastic processes which satisfy the basic statistical properties of sfd .",
    "in this section we introduce a generalization of standard fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite called step fractional brownian motion ( sfbm ) and show that it can be used to describe the basic statistical properties of sfd .",
    "fbm has been widely used to model many areas such as turbulence , internet traffic , financial time series , biomedical processes , etc .",
    "one limitation of fbm model is that the long time ( or low frequency ) behavior that exhibit long - range dependence , and the short time ( or high frequency ) behavior that characterizes fractal property are both described by a single hurst parameter @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , a constant hurst parameter is too restrictive for many applications . during the past decade",
    "different generalizations of fbm have been proposed to address this problem . among them",
    "the most well - known is the multifractional brownian motion ( mbm ) , which was introduced independently in @xcite and @xcite . for mbm",
    "the hurst parameter @xmath18 is replaced by @xmath19 , a deterministic function depending on time .",
    "mbm was later extended to generalized multifractional brownian motion ( gmbm ) in order to model systems which require @xmath19 to be a irregular function of time @xcite . however , there exist processes and phenomena which exhibit abrupt changes of hurst parameter requiring @xmath19 to be a piecewise constant function of time . for the description of such behavior ,",
    "benassi et al @xcite introduced the step fractional brownian motion ( sfbm ) . a similar process known as multiscale fractional brownian motion with its hurst parameter varying as a piecewise function of frequencies",
    "was also studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "recall that the standard fbm @xmath20 is a gaussian process with mean zero and correlation function given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 is not a stationary process , but its increment process is stationary .",
    "fbm is a self - similar process which satisfies for all @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes equality in all finite distributions .",
    "the stationary property of the increments of @xmath20 allows the following harmonizable representation for the process : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the fourier transform of @xmath31  the standard white noise defined by @xmath32    for modeling a process that evolves from time @xmath33 , instead of using the usual or standard fbm ( which begins at time @xmath34 ) , it will be more appropriate to use an alternative fbm that starts at time zero .",
    "this second type of fbm is known as riemann - liouville fbm ( rl - fbm ) , which is defined as the rl fractional integral of white noise @xcite : @xmath35 @xmath36 is a gaussian process with zero mean @xmath37 and correlation function given by @xmath38 when @xmath39 . here @xmath40 denotes the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "the variance of the process @xmath36 is @xmath41    note that for the standard fbm @xmath20 , the hurst parameter @xmath18 should lie in the range @xmath42 , whereas for rl - fbm @xmath36 , @xmath18 takes any positive real value .",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath36 reduce to ordinary brownian motion when @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath20 which has stationary increments , the increments of @xmath36 are non - stationary . due to the failure of its increments to be stationary , @xmath36 does not has a harmonizable representation . when @xmath44 , rl - fbm approaches the standard fbm @xcite",
    ".    now we want to consider the step fractional brownian motion ( sfbm ) .",
    "such a generalization of fbm was first introduced for standard fbm using the harmonizable representation as follow @xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 if @xmath51 and @xmath52 if @xmath53 .",
    "this is an adaptation of mbm , which is defined for a time - dependent hurst parameter @xmath19 . due to the absence of such representation in rl - fbm",
    ", we generalize @xmath36 to rl - sfbm based on the moving average representation : @xmath54 with @xmath19 the piecewise function given by , except that in this case @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "its covariance is given by @xmath57if @xmath39 , and its variance @xmath58 is given by with @xmath18 replaced by @xmath19 .",
    "the property of global self - similarity does not apply to both mbm and sfbm . in the case of mbm ,",
    "the notion of self - similarity is replaced by the local asymptotic self - similarity @xcite , which is also satisfied by sfbm and rl - sfbm with some modification .",
    "suppose @xmath59 is a rl - sfbm with scaling function @xmath19 defined above . for all @xmath60 , @xmath61",
    "the convergence is in the sense of distributions . in other words ,",
    "the tangent process of rl - sfbm for each scale @xmath62 is @xmath63 , a fbm indexed by @xmath62 .    for modeling sfd",
    ", we use rl - sfbm with single change of scale , that is the process with @xmath64 . to be more specific",
    ", we denote this process by @xmath65 , the two - scale rl - sfbm indexed by @xmath66 and @xmath67 . for this simple case",
    ", we can write @xmath68 from the above definition , one sees that @xmath65 is a gaussian process with zero mean and correlation function @xmath69 when @xmath39 , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , is given by with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , its variance @xmath74 is given by with @xmath18 replaced by @xmath19 .",
    "thus , @xmath65 , the rl - sfbm with two scales , behaves like @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and behaves like @xmath77 when @xmath78 ( see fig .",
    "@xmath79 is piecewise self - similar , it is self - similar of order @xmath80 in the time interval @xmath81 , and of order @xmath82 in the time interval @xmath83 .    in order to use rl - sfbm for modeling sfd",

    "the value of @xmath97 is set to equal to @xmath98 so that the msd is continuous .",
    "a sample path of the process @xmath65 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "there are some further generalizations of rl - sfbm which can be used to model sfd .",
    "for example , one can use a piecewise linear function @xmath19 in so that @xmath99 for @xmath100 , @xmath101 for @xmath102 and @xmath19 is a linear function interpolating the points @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the interval @xmath105 $ ] .",

    "[ f4 ] ) .    as remarked by krger @xcite , random walk model",
    "can only be regarded as an approximation to the real sfd systems . at short times ,",
    "such systems first undergo ballistic motion with the msd @xmath110 . in other words",
    ", there is the possibility of the direct transition from the ballistic regime to the single - file regime .",
    "such a tendency becomes more prominent with increasing concentration ; and it has been demonstrated by molecular dynamical simulations @xcite . for modeling sfd that is ballistic at small @xmath0 , we can use rl - sfbm with three scales . here",
    "we consider the case of a sfd process with three regimes : initial ballistic regime followed by the normal diffusion , and finally the single - file diffusion region .",
    "for such a process , we let the time - dependent hurst exponent in to be @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "[ f7 ] .",
    "in this section we want to examine whether it is possible to describe the basic characteristics of sfd based on the various types of fractional langevin equations .",
    "we shall first show that how rl - sfbm can be obtained as the solution to the `` free fractional langevin equation '' ( fractional langevin equation without damping ) .",
    "this will be followed by discussion on the fractional generalized langevin equation and its extensions .",
    "first note that the definition of rl - fbm can be written as : @xmath115 where the riemann - liouville ( rl ) fractional integral @xmath116 is given by @xcite : @xmath117the riemann - liouville fractional derivative @xmath118 is defined as @xmath119 for @xmath120 . in view of the property that @xmath121(0 ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] we can consider as the solution of the `` free '' fractional langevin equation @xmath122 subject to the initial condition @xmath123 . in a similar way",

    "recall that brownian motion can also be regarded as the position process associated with the solution ( velocity process ) of the usual langevin equation .",
    "it is natural to ask if a similar link exist for rl - fbm and rl - sfbm with fractional langevin equation . for this purpose",
    "we first consider the following general type of fractional langevin equation with two different fractional orders @xmath127 and @xmath128 @xcite : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the dissipative parameter , and @xmath31 is the standard white noise . here",
    "we remark that @xmath131 can be regarded as `` shifted '' fractional derivative as compared with the un - shifted one @xmath132 . by using binomial expansion , the shifted fractional derivative",

    "if the usual velocity - position relation is used , that is velocity is the ordinary derivative of position , then the variance of the position process does not depend on the long - time behavior of the correlation of the velocity process .",
    "one always get the variance of @xmath137 behaves like @xmath138 , just like the case of normal diffusion .",
    "the long - time dependence of the covariance of @xmath136 which varies as @xmath139 does not enter in the leading term of the variance of @xmath137 , it only appears as second leading term @xcite .    on the other hand , if one assumes @xmath140 where @xmath141 , such that @xmath142 then we have shown in @xcite that @xmath143 . therefore for @xmath144 , one gets the correct long time behavior for the msd of sfd .",
    "here we have used the fact that @xmath145=0 .",
    "as for the short time behavior , it can be shown that @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the correct short time behavior for the msd of sfd , we require @xmath147 .",
    "we notice that for the characterization of the mean square displacements of sfd , the parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 appears in the combination @xmath148 . therefore , we can restrict ourselves to the case @xmath149 , for then the process @xmath150 satisfies the following fractional langevin equation : @xmath151with initial conditions @xmath152 and @xmath153 . setting @xmath154 and @xmath144 recovers the basic properties for sfd .",

    "compare to the result of previous section , we find that when @xmath268 , the conditions @xmath250 and @xmath204 are the same , but the range of @xmath301 is from @xmath256 to @xmath257 , which has larger range of values as compared to the case when @xmath270 .",
    "finally we remark on the case where @xmath259 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath302 . therefore , the small and large time asymptotic behaviors of the msd for sfd is satisfied if @xmath303 and the msd is ballistic at small @xmath0 if @xmath304      the results above can be easily generalized to fractional langevin equation with more general ( nonlocal ) dissipative memory kernel @xmath184 which behaves like @xmath305 , @xmath306 when @xmath179 and behaves like @xmath307 , @xmath241 when @xmath44 .",
    "we note that @xmath308 is the special case of the dirac delta function kernel .",
    "the fractional generalized langevin equation considered in section [ s3b ] corresponds to @xmath309 , whereas the extended fractional generalized langevin equation considered in section [ s3c ] corresponds to @xmath310 . for the laplace transform of the dissipative memory kernel @xmath311",
    ", one finds that @xmath312 when @xmath313 and @xmath314 when @xmath315 .",
    "the solution @xmath189 can be written as , where the small-@xmath0 and large-@xmath0 asymptotic behaviors of the functions @xmath273 and @xmath274 are still given by and .",

    "we have proposed some stochastic processes that can describe the basic properties of sfd . in the first case ,",
    "we find that the replacement of the hurst exponent in fractional brownian motion by a two - valued step function can be used to model sfd that is normal diffusive at small time and sub - diffusive at large time . since fractional brownian motion",
    "can be considered as a solution of a special case of fractional langevin equation , it is natural to consider modeling sfd by fractional langevin equation .",
    "we have discussed in detail the cases where the dissipative memory kernel is a dirac delta function , a power - law function as well as the combination of these two . for each of these cases , we find that there is a range of the parameters where the corresponding fractional langevin equation can be used to model process whose msd behaves like @xmath237 when @xmath0 is small and behaves like @xmath238 when @xmath0 is large .",
    "this range has been determined explicitly .",
    "the corresponding range of the parameters for which the msd of the process behaves like @xmath157 instead of @xmath237 when @xmath0 is small is also determined .",
    "one weakness of usig sfbm to model sfd is that the change of scaling exponent is not continuous so that the transition from the normal diffusion to the anomalous subdiffusion occurs abruptly .",
    "this weakness is overcome by various fractional langevin models .",
    "however , we only use the short and long time behaviors of the stochastic processes to determine the model . for a more complete description of sfd",
    ", it is necessary to take into account the boundary conditions at the ends of the single - file system , as these would become relevant if the system is of finite extension .",
    "furthermore , one may also have to consider the interaction between the diffusion particles with the wall of the single - file system .",
    "thus , the evolution of the particles in the single - file system during the intermediate time interval becomes relevant .",
    "we hope to incorporate the physical mechanism of sfd in order to obtain a more realistic model of sfd in our future work .",

    "in this appendix , we give the details of the analysis of the asymptotic properties of the functions @xmath273 and @xmath274 defined as the inverse laplace transform of @xmath332by taking laplace transforms , it is easy to check that @xmath333therefore , as @xmath179 , @xmath334this behavior is independent of the coefficients @xmath335 and @xmath336 . for the large-@xmath0 asymptotic behaviors ,",
