    "several nmr experiments on metallic nanoparticles have shown @xcite quantum size effects : the absorption spectra becomes quite broad and asymmetric when either temperature or particle size diminishes .",
    "studies of relaxation time @xcite @xmath0 indicate that the spectra is inhomogeneous , implying phenomena of a local nature .",
    "this inhomogeneity has been interpreted @xcite considering a strictly local description for the electron polarization in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "given the bohr magneton , @xmath2 , and @xmath3*r*@xmath4 , the local density of _ s _ states at the fermi level @xmath5 , the _ local _ pauli susceptibility is written as : @xmath6 this equation expresses that , due to the finite size effects and interference phenomena proper of the mesoscopic systems , the electronic spin polarization is _",
    "inhomogeneous_. the hyperfine coupling between nuclear spins and electronic spins produces different shifts in the resonance frequency for _ each _ nucleus in the nanoparticle : @xmath7 therefore , an inhomogeneously broadened nmr  absorption line is the key to indirectly measure the fluctuations of the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "in previous works @xcite we have calculated the nmr line shape in metallic nanoparticles within a tight binding model with @xmath8 orbitals accounting for the fluctuations of the ldos .",
    "a remarkable outcome , consistent with many experimental results @xcite , is a universal scaling behavior of the line position and shape with respect to the variation of the thermal energy @xmath9 and the mean spacing level @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "this results in a universal scaling law for the knight shifts and the pauli susceptibility @xcite whose relevant parameter is @xmath11 however , in very small crystalline particles , the experimental line shape presents an anomalous over - broadening at intermediate temperatures @xcite .",

    "conductivity measurements show that tunneling among particles plays a relevant role in the electronic properties @xcite .",
    "this suggests the need to explore for additional sources of fluctuations on the statistics of energy levels , particularly the effects of surface states .",
    "it is known that self consistent calculations of metal surfaces @xcite give different ionization energies for surface and bulk sites .",
    "this fact is expected both in metallic particles with clean surfaces and as well as those with chemisorbed atoms . in our previous calculation",
    "we made no attempt to consider surface states .",
    "however the natural connectivity of the surface orbitals caused slight departures from the universal scaling law @xcite .",
    "in the present work we use a tight binding hamiltonian with an _ ad hoc _ shift in the surface site energies @xcite .",
    "this produces surface states , and as a consequence , large fluctuations on the ldos distribution . according to the eqs .",

    "we compare our calculations of the knight shift as a function of the scaling parameter with experimental values on aluminum nanoparticles and show that the observed deviation of the scaling law is a manifestation of surface effects .",
    "a metal particle with @xmath8 atoms can be modeled with the hamiltonian    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the energy of an @xmath14 state centered at site @xmath15 of a cubic lattice .",

    "from now on , @xmath63 will refer indistinctly to either the distribution of the normalized ldos at the fermi energy or the knight shift nmr spectrum .",
    "quantum size effects manifest as shifts of the nmr line maximum : as the particle size or temperature decreases , the shift goes from @xmath67 ( metal bulk ) to @xmath68 ( salt ) while the line broadens and turns asymmetrical @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the simple model used in this work only attempts to provide physical insight into the quantum size effects as manifested in the ldos distribution , as well as a qualitative description of surface effects .",
    "to model small surface to volume ratios proper of a big particle , the surface sites ( with mean site energy @xmath69 ) were chosen on a single face of a @xmath70 cube , i.e. @xmath71 are surface sites _  _ and @xmath72 are bulk sites . in this case",

    "@xmath76 @xmath77 ( corresponding to one side of the cube ) and @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80    it shows that the shift in the site energies produces an over - broadening with respect to the knight shift distribution from the same sites for the homogeneous configuration with @xmath75 ( thin line ) .",
    "the over - broadening suggests the existence of multiple fluctuation scales in the nmr spectrum . to clarify this , figure 2(a ) shows the projection of the density of states ( dos ) at surface sites , @xmath81 .",
    "it reveals two structures , one corresponding to surface sites with a typical spacing @xmath82 and another one with typical spacing @xmath83 corresponding to bulk sites . notice that the structure of bulk states ( fig .",
    "2.b ) , characterized by a mean level spacing of @xmath83 , enters into the surface dos as a substructure .",
    "these bulk states have a small weight on the surface band because @xmath21 provides a barrier that prevents the mixing between states with the same kinetic energy ( @xmath84 ) parallel to the surface .",

    "typically @xmath89 .",
    "within a perturbative calculation , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the main peaks in @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "2.a ) arise from those in @xmath93 they produce a wide range of high ldos values with low probability ( tail in the @xmath94 , fig .",
    "the valleys of the global structure will produce lower density values with high probability ( peak in the @xmath94 ) . in the same way",
    ", the denser spectrum of the bulk band @xmath95 , which contributes with small weight , provides a lower scale fluctuations to @xmath96 .",

    "@xmath76 @xmath97 and @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80    again , the peaks and valleys of @xmath98 produce an asymmetric distribution @xmath99 with a maximum .",
    "therefore , the superposition of these two ldos will cause the over - broadening in the distribution of knight shifts for the surface sites roughly represented by : @xmath100 even without attempting a fitting , this shows that the predictions of numerical results are consistent with the spectral analysis .",
    "( thick line ) , compared with the case with @xmath75 ( thin line ) .",
    "@xmath101 @xmath102 and ( corresponding to the six sides of the cube ) @xmath103 @xmath79 and @xmath80     ( thick line ) , compared with the case with @xmath75 ( thin line ) .",
    "@xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath104 @xmath79 and @xmath80     _ vs. _ the scaling parameter @xmath105 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to simulations of various particle sizes with surface energy @xmath69 for all faces of the cube .",
    "experimental values correspond to aluminum nanoparticles @xcite . in both simulations and experiments a deviation of the universal scaling law is observed . ]    in order to evaluate the effect of surface states on bulk nmr signal of big particles , figure 3 shows the knight shift spectrum ( thick line ) for the bulk sites together with a case with unperturbed surfaces @xmath106 represented by the thin line .",
    "@xmath99 does not present much over - broadening with respect to the homogeneous configuration@xmath20 the reason for this can be understood by analyzing the dos projection on bulk sites .",
    "the relevant scale in @xmath107 ( fig .",
    "2.b ) is @xmath83 . since surface states enter into the bulk with small weight , and since @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) , the relevant scale is dictated by spacing of bulk levels .",
    "therefore , the surface band does not affect the statistics of the ldos of bulk sites .",
    "the previous analysis suggests that if the surface to volume ratio is big , as in very small particles where @xmath110 the over - broadening should occur on the ldos distribution of bulk sites_. _ the cluster configuration must be such that the surface sites _  _",
    "are in higher proportion with respect to the bulk sites_. _ this situation can be obtained for a structure with @xmath111 orbitals , taking all faces of the cube with shifted site energies @xmath69 ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) . in this case @xmath114 .",
    "figure 4 shows the knight shift spectrum of bulk sites for this new configuration . the distribution ( thick line ) is broader than the corresponding homogeneous case ( thin line ) .",
    "the reason is the same as the one discussed in connection with fig .",
    "1 provided that the relation @xmath115 is now inverted . however , the nmr spectrum of surface sites ( fig .",
    "5 ) exhibits a considerable over - broadening , unlike the case presented in fig .",
    "this is due to the fact that , because of the topology of surface sites , completely surrounding bulk sites , there is a strong mixing between surface states and interior states , which also produces two fluctuation scales on the ldos distribution at the surface .",
    "we now discuss the surface effects on the scaling law .",
    "6 shows the relative knight shift as a function of the scaling parameter @xmath116 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to our results for particles of various sizes with surface energies on all faces of the cube .",
    "these curves correspond to particles of @xmath70 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 sites .",
    "experimental results by kobayashi @xcite _ et al _ on aluminum nanoparticles are also shown .",
    "the qualitative dependency of the relative knight shift with @xmath105 agrees very well with our result .",
    "in addition , a deviation of the scaling law is clearly observed in both , simulations and experiment .",
    "large particles lie further to the right than small particles .",
    "this can be interpreted as follow : due to the existence of surface states , the mean spacing level at the fermi energy is no longer @xmath119 , since this last spacing is defined according to the density of states of the bulk . therefore , @xmath105 is no longer the scaling parameter .",
    "if we define @xmath120 as the mean spacing level at the fermi energy in presence of surface states and @xmath121 the corresponding scaling parameter , then , according to eq .",
    "[ alpha ] , @xmath122 . since bulk states and surface states become uncorrelated and consequently the repulsion of levels around the fermi energy decreases , @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the factor @xmath124 counts for the deviation of the scaling law .",
    "it is smaller for smaller particles than for larger particles which is consistent with the experimental and predicted results in fig .",
    "according to our results , we expect that the nmr spectra of either surface or bulk nuclei in small metallic nanoparticles , manifest the existence of surface states as an over - broadened line which could also be interpreted as a strong _ disorder_. in fact , the deviation of the scaling law shown in the experiment on aluminum nanoparticles @xcite is an indication of different distributions of energy spacings coming from bulk and surface states . additionally to the over - broadening of crystalline ni particles",
    "@xcite which is consistent with this view , there are other ways in which these effects might be observed and tested : the nmr technique sedor ( spin echo double resonance ) consists of simultaneous irradiation of resonances of nuclei of two different species which are coupled either by direct dipolar interaction or through the conduction electrons . with this method",
    "the contribution to the resonance spectra of the nuclei from the surface can be inferred . a very interesting application",
    "@xcite is the test of platinum nanoparticles using carbon as a local probe .",
    "the last is chemisorbed on the pt surface as co. there , the presence of a second peak in the pt sedor  line might be interpreted as the coexistence of surface and bulk states .",
    "also based on the co chemisorption at the surface of a metallic nanoparticle , it has been observed @xcite that carbon nmr presents a shift toward a metallic nature .",
    "not only the korringa equation for the relaxation time @xmath125 is verified ( @xmath126 ) but the line shape presents the inhomogeneity proper of quantum size effects .",
    "that is , due to the mixing between the conduction band of the metal and the co molecular orbitals , the frequency shift of the c nuclei contains information of the ldos on the surface nuclei .",
    "eventually an nmr study of chemisorbed molecules also would give evidence of anomalous fluctuations in surface ldos .",
