    "the specific data analyzed in this paper are presented in paper i. in brief , they consist of 133 galex all - sky imaging survey pointings overlapping the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite in the south galactic pole region . as the nuv images are substantially deeper than the fuv , we used the nuv images for detection and measured the fuv flux in the same aperture as for the nuv .",
    "the apparent magnitudes were corrected for foreground extinction using the @xcite reddening maps and assuming the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "the galex catalogs were matched with the 2df catalog using a search radius of @xmath15 .",
    "we restricted the sample to areas with effective exposure times @xmath16 sec , and removed sources with magnitude errors greater than 0.4 or contaminated by artifacts from bright stars .",
    "we also removed overlap regions by restricting the coverage to the inner @xmath17 of each field .",
    "finally , we excluded galex sources where the 2df redshift completeness was less than 80% as well as areas of the sky excluded from the 2df input catalog .",

    "2000 ) , suggesting that the so - called excess was to be found in the estimate of the uv flux of these objects rather than in some physical explanation .",
    "on the other hand we find a small fraction of galaxies with @xmath25 colors somewhat bluer than any model ( @xmath33 in the fuv selected sample , @xmath34 in the nuv selected sample ) .",
    "this is partly due to newly measured , small but opposite offsets in the fuv and nuv calibrations , adding up to + 0.13 in @xmath25 ( new in - flight calibrations , p. morissey , private communication ) , not applied in the current catalogs . but",

    "uv @xmath35-corrections are small enough for the late - type , low - redshift galaxies dominating the sample ( as opposed to @xmath35-corrections in optical bands ) that uncertainties on the assigned seds have negligible impact on the resulting lfs .",
    "we can also fit a power - law through the 2 bandpasses and derive a spectral index for each galaxy ( @xmath36 , assuming @xmath37 ) .",
    "the mean spectral indices of the fuv and nuv selected samples are @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "the uv slope @xmath40 has been shown to be a good tracer of dust attenuation in galaxies undergoing a strong starburst , but not so reliably in others ( bell 2002 , kong et al .",
    ". in particular , buat et al .  (",
    "2004 ) found that local nuv selected galaxies tend to have lower attenuations than starburts for a given slope .",
    "as our two samples exhibit slopes corresponding to low attenuations in pure starburst galaxies , we conclude that they must be very little affected by dust .",
    "( see paper i for a quantitative discussion ) .",
    "we split both samples into two rest - frame color bins : @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( roughly corresponding to an sb spectral type and to the mean of the color distribution ) , referred to as blue and red subsamples respectively .",

    "2002 , nakamura et al .",
    "2003 ) , the local lfs of the bluest galaxies tend to have steeper faint end slopes and fainter characteristic magnitudes m@xmath2 than the reddest subsamples ( although our definition of red would qualify as blue in optically selected samples ) .",
    "the fact that the latest types are observed to fainter absolute magnitudes than the earlier types induces a small bias in the estimate of the faint end slope of the full sample .",
    "the dotted lines in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ lfs ] show that the sum of the blue and red lfs is slightly steeper at the faint end than estimated for the galaxy population as a whole , due to the shortage of red galaxies in the faintest bins .",
    "the total fuv and nuv lfs in the highest redshift bin ( lower panels in fig .  [ lfs ] ) are both consistent with @xmath3 magnitude brightening in m@xmath2 with respect to the lfs at @xmath79 .",
    "this evolution is quite similar to that found in optically selected samples at the same redshifts ( loveday 2004 ) .",
    "evolution can also be inferred from the steeply rising v / v@xmath47 distribution of both @xmath41-unlimited samples ( with @xmath80v / v@xmath81 in both bands instead of the 0.5 expected from a non evolving population ) . as the redshift distributions show two strong peaks around 0.06 and 0.11 ( paper i ) , the appearance of evolution",
    "could be attributed to large scale structure effects , but removing these two structures from the samples did not affect our results .",
    "evolution also seems to occur predominantly in the blue subsamples , with blue galaxies dominating the bright end of the lf in the highest @xmath41 bin .",
    "we checked that no color trend was observed as a function of @xmath20 , as might be expected if the 2dfgrs was strongly biased against , e.g. , faint blue low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbg ) , making bright blue galaxies seem dominant at higher redshift .",
    "the issue of missing galaxies in the 2dfgrs , in particular lsbgs , has been addressed in a number of papers , most recently by cross et al .",
    "the authors find that the survey does indeed miss @xmath33 of the galaxy population , of which @xmath82 only are identified as lsbgs .",
    "if this particular class of objects is unlikely to affect our results , the remaining missing galaxies may bias our analysis , should their redshift distribution look different from the one actually measured .",
    "a truly uv - selected spectroscopic survey is underway to address this question .",
    "the present results are consistent with the fuv analysis of a much deeper galex field probing adjacent and higher redshifts ( arnouts et al .  2004 , schiminovich et al .",
    "they are also in rough agreement with the rate of evolution derived from a photometric - redshift study of galex / sdss data at low @xmath41 ( budavri et al .",
    "2004 ) , although our fuv lf in the range @xmath83 seems brighter than the photo-@xmath41 estimate at overlapping @xmath41 .",
    "both analysis agree very well in the nuv however ( we postpone attempts at explanations for the fuv discrepancy until more comparable datasets are available ) . we note that evolution seems to be limited by the observed galaxy number counts , especially in the fuv band ( xu et al .",
    "2004 ) , so that the rate of evolution detected at @xmath84 in the galex data is expected to slow down .",
