    "in recent years there has been considerable interest in probability density functions ( pdf ) for navier  stokes turbulence .",
    "similar questions can be asked for random solutions of burgers equation ( `` burgulence '' ) .",
    "we are interested here in the tail behavior of the pdf of the density @xmath0 for solutions to the @xmath1-dimensional burgers equation in the limit of vanishing viscosity ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 the initial potential @xmath4 and the initial density @xmath5 are random functions of the space variable .",
    "this problem arises , for example , in the study of large - scale structures in the universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as is well known , the burgers equation leads to shocks in which the density of matter is infinite . yet",
    ", large but finite densities do not necessarily occur in the neighborhood of shocks .",
    "e _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a related problem of determining the pdf of the velocity gradient for the one - dimensional burgers equation with large - scale and white - in - time random forcing .",
    "they showed that large negative gradients come from `` preshocks '' ( nascent shocks ) which contribute a power - law tail with exponent -7/2 to the pdf .",
    "preshocks correspond to fast fluid particles catching up for the first time with slow ones .",
    "they constitute discrete events in ( eulerian ) space time .",
    "we have shown that the -7/2 law for the pdf of ( negative ) velocity gradients in one dimension applies also ( i ) for decaying ( unforced ) `` burgulence '' with smooth ( i.e. large - scale ) random initial conditions @xcite and ( ii ) for the case of a deterministic time and space - periodic force which is a sum of delta functions in time with smooth space dependence @xcite .",
    "for this `` kicked burgulence '' , the -7/2 law was also obtained numerically ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "[ f : first - deriv ]",
    "we turn now to the multi - dimensional problem ( [ burgdd])-([rhodd ] ) with smooth and random initial conditions ( for details see ref .",
    "as is known , the one or multi - dimensional viscous burgers equation can be solved explicitly by means of the cole  hopf transformation . from this , by taking the limit @xmath2 , a `` maximum representation '' can be derived for the velocity potential @xmath6 the maximum is achieved at a point at which the gradient of the r.h.s .",
    "vanishes , leading to @xmath7 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath8 is a lagrangian coordinate .",
    "the `` naive '' lagrangian map @xmath9 given by this relation is however not invertible , except for short times .",
    "the requirement that the maximum in ( [ maxrep ] ) is _ global _ can be recast in geometrical terms by introducing the lagrangian potential @xmath10 and the `` proper '' lagrangian map @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the convex - hull of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "for example , in one dimension , the graph of @xmath12 is obtained by tightly pulling a string over the graph of @xmath13 .",
    "the graph of @xmath12 coincides with that of @xmath13 at regular points , wherever fluid particles have not yet fallen into shocks .",
    "it also contains linear and ruled manifolds associated to the different types of shocks : segments when @xmath14 , triangles and ruled surfaces when @xmath15 , etc .",
    "conservation of mass implies that the density is given , at regular points , by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the jacobian of the lagrangian map .",
    "( the density is infinite in shocks . )",
    "since the jacobian is ( up to a factor @xmath18 ) equal to the hessian of the lagrangian potential ( determinant of the matrix of second space derivatives ) , it follows that large densities are typically obtained only near parabolic points .",
    "however , arbitrarily close to a parabolic point there are generically hyperbolic points where the surface defined by @xmath13 crosses its tangent ( hyper)plane and which , therefore , do not belong to its convex hull . yet , there exist in general exceptional `` kurtoparabolic '' points which are parabolic and belong to the boundary of the set of regular points .",
    "near such points , arbitrarily large densities are obtained . in one dimension , the only kurtoparabolic points are the preshocks which are discrete space - time events in both eulerian and lagrangian coordinates . in two and more dimensions ,",
    "kurtoparabolic points are also born at preshocks but persist in general for a finite time ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "in eulerian space , they are associated to boundaries of shocks ( e.g. end points of shock lines for @xmath15 ) .",
    "we just indicate general ideas involved in the determination of the density pdf for random initial conditions ( which need not be homogeneous ) .",
    "the determination of the large-@xmath0 tail of the cumulative probability distribution of the density is equivalent to finding the fraction of eulerian space - time where @xmath0 exceeds a given value .",
    "the latter is determined by changing from eulerian to lagrangian coordinates and using a suitable normal form ( i.e.  a taylor expansion to the relevant order ) of the lagrangian potential near a kurtoparabolic point .",
    "the theory is rather different in one dimension and higher dimensions , because kurtoparabolic points are persistent only in the latter case .",
    "however , the scaling law for the resulting pdf , namely @xmath19 , is the same in all dimensions .",
    "in fact , when @xmath20 , two orthogonal spatial directions play the same role as space and time in one dimension .",
    "it is clear that the algebraic tail of the pdf of velocity gradients or of density for burgulence comes from identified singularities .",
    "measurements of pdf s for space or time derivatives of eulerian velocities for incompressible three - dimensional navier  stokes turbulence have not revealed power law tails , but such tails may just have been , so far , `` lost in the experimental noise '' .",
    "there has indeed been considerable speculations about singularities of the navier ",
    "stokes equations in the inviscid limit .",
    "if singularities with divergent gradients are present , they will give power - law tails , at least as intermediate asymptotics when the viscosity is small ( the converse is however not true , since statistical effects not related to singularities can also give power laws ) . the confirmed absence of power laws would probably rule out singularities ."
