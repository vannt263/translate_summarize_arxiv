    "quasars are highly energetic sources located at the centers of galaxies created by accretion of matter onto supermassive black holes .",
    "they are the most luminous subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and one of the most luminous classes of objects in the universe . through accurate measurements of the quasar luminosity function and its evolution ,",
    "the formation history of supermassive black holes can been studied in detail ( @xcite and references therein ) . for studies of baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and the ly-@xmath15 forest ,",
    "quasars act as tracers and backlights of matter clustering ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all these studies benefit from efficient and/or complete selection of large quasar samples .",
    "@xcite pioneered quasar selection through the use of multi - color imaging data .",
    "because quasars are not characterized by a single temperature like stars , they usually occupy different regions of color space .",
    "for instance , most quasars are bluer in the uv / visible and redder in the infrared . by virtue of this , color selection methods using uv , visible , and mid - infrared photometry are one of the easiest and most common ways to select quasars at various redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nearly all quasars show @xmath1410%20% stochastic variability at uv and visible wavelengths over timescales of many months to years @xcite . since only a small fraction of stars are variable at this level , and many of these variable stars are periodic , variability data strongly separates quasars from stars .",
    "models of variability such as a power - law @xcite or a damped random walk @xcite are usually used to identify the quasars . with the emergence of time - domain surveys such as pan - starrs @xcite and the future",
    "large synoptic sky telescope @xcite , quasar selection based on variability will increase in significance and potentially help to fill the selection gaps of color selection techniques .",
    "in addition to color and variability selection , more sophisticated selection methods have been developed , such as full multi - wavelength sed fitting @xcite , kernel density estimation @xcite , the likelihood method @xcite , neural networks @xcite , and extreme deconvolution @xcite .",
    "these statistical methods model the underlying flux distribution of quasars based on empirical data and then assign probabilities that sources are quasars .",
    "the modeled phase space is expandable and can include variability in addition to flux .",
    "statistical quasar selection methods have proven to be very efficient , as they incorporate multi - dimensional information on quasar properties @xcite .",
    "we aim to quantify various quasar selection methods for luminous and point source quasars such as color selection , probabilistic selection , variability selection , and combinations of the selection methods in the dark energy survey ( des ) supernova fields .",
    "the dark energy survey ( des ) is a 5000 deg@xmath13 _",
    "_ grizy-__band survey of the southern sky to probe the nature of dark energy @xcite .",
    "des includes ten fields with a total area of @xmath14 30 deg@xmath13 that are surveyed at a higher cadence to search for type ia supernovae , and are known as the des supernova fields .",
    "we also present a catalog of spectroscopically - confirmed quasars observed by ozdes @xcite in the des supernova fields .",
    "ozdes is a complementary spectroscopic survey that targets the supernova fields to obtain redshifts for supernovae host galaxies and to conduct quasar reverberation mapping experiment @xcite and other projects .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : data ] , we describe our photometric data sets and their corresponding surveys .",
    "these surveys include the dark energy survey ( des ) , the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; @xcite ) , and wise @xcite .",

    "finally , we close in  [ sec : discussion ] with discussions and conclusions . throughout the paper",
    ", we adopted a flat @xmath16cdm cosmology with @xmath17 = 70 km s@xmath18mpc@xmath18 and @xmath19=0.3 . unless stated otherwise , all visible magnitudes refer to the des magnitudes .",
    "the ab magnitude system is used when quoting sdss and des magnitudes , while the vega magnitude system is used for wise and vhs magnitudes .",
    "the dark energy survey ( des ) is a wide - area 5000 deg@xmath13 survey of the southern hemisphere in the _ grizy _ bands @xcite . using the dark energy camera ( decam ; @xcite ) at the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory , des aims to probe the nature of dark energy using four different astrophysical probes : type ia supernovae , baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , galaxy clusters , and weak lensing .",
    "the planned 5@xmath20 point source depths of the survey are _ g _ = 26.5 mag , _ r _ = 26 mag , _ i _ = 25.3 mag , _ z _ = 24.7 mag , and _ y _ = 23 mag @xcite",
    ". des is covering much more area than other surveys of similar depth ( e.g. the noao deep wide - field survey , @xcite ) and is much deeper than other surveys of larger area ( e.g. sdss and pan - starrs ) , so it is well suited to identifying new quasars .",
    "the survey finished its third season of operation in february 2016 @xcite and recently started its fourth observing season in august 2016 .",
    "des conducts a multi - epoch supernova survey of two deep fields ( c3 and x3 ) and eight shallow fields to search for type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "each supernova field subtends @xmath14 3 deg@xmath13 , or 30 deg@xmath13 total .",
    "the supernova survey has a mean cadence of @xmath14 7 days in the _ griz _ bands .",
    "while the main des survey is conducted under good seeing conditions ( at a median fwhm @xmath14 09 ) , it switches to imaging the supernova fields when the seeing increases to @xmath21 11 or when the supernova fields have not been observed for more than a week .",
    "the supernova component is expected to comprise roughly one - third or @xmath14 1300 hours of the total des observing time .",
    "table [ tab : des_sn ] shows the names and field centers of the ten supernova fields .",
    "most of the supernova fields are also well - studied by other surveys such as the chandra deep field - south ( cdfs ; @xcite ) and the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ; @xcite ) .",
    "these fields are optimal for studying variability - based quasar selection since they have more photometric epochs than the main des wide - field survey . by the end of the 5-year survey ,",
    "all ten supernova fields are expected to have more than ten times the exposure time of the wide - field survey , more than 100 epochs , and reach an expected 5@xmath20 point source depth in the _ griz _ bands of @xmath14 28 mag for the deep supernova fields and @xmath14 26.5 mag for the shallow fields @xcite .    for our work",
    ", we used the coadded catalog _",
    "y1a1_coadd_objects_dfull _ for the des year one ( y1 , begun in 2013b ) observations of the supernova fields .",
    "the catalog combines all available exposures ( 300 or more ) from the des y1 operation and some from the science verification phase that have sufficient image quality ( typical seeing fwhm @xmath7 11 , or 125 in some cases ) .",
    "it is typically @xmath14 2 magnitudes deeper than the des y1 wide field coadded catalog .",
    "the catalog includes the weighted average of many photometric quantities from single - epoch des data .",
    "for example , _ wavgcalib_mag_psf _ and _ wavg_magerr_psf _ are the weighted average of the single - epoch _ mag_psf _ and _ magerr_psf _ values . the weighted averages are often found to be more accurate than the coadded quantities derived from sextractor @xcite , especially in areas where the number of epochs is small or where the coadded psfs are not well - fit by psfex @xcite .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we used the weighted average quantities whenever referring to des photometry , such as _ wavgcalib_mag_psf_[grizy ] _ and _ wavg_magerr_psf_[grizy ] _ for the magnitudes and magnitude errors .",
    "[ t ] [ tab : des_sn ]    .des supernova fields [ cols=\"^ , < , < , < \" , ]     quasars with non - detections in des bands , no wise matches , or no vhs matches have entries of 99 for their magnitudes and errors . the naming schemes for the photometry follow the catalogs from which they are derived ; see the relevant sections as indicated for more information",
    ". there are 44 columns in the catalog .",
    "[ fig : ozdes_miz ]",
    "large samples of quasars are needed to measure quasar luminosity functions and their evolution , particularly at lower luminosities , to estimate quasar host halo masses with weak lensing , and to study baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) with the ly-@xmath15 forest , most notably with the dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ) .",
    "we used the @xcite quasar catalog for the sdss stripe 82 region that overlaps the des supernova fields , which we refer to as the p15-s1s2 quasar catalog , to analyze the completeness and efficiency of quasar color selection , probabilistic selection , variability selection , and combinations of colors and probabilistic selection methods with variability at the bright ( @xmath6 @xmath7 19.8 mag ) and faint ( @xmath6 @xmath7 22 mag ) magnitude limits .",
    "we used only point sources that satisfy our data quality and photometric error cuts .",
    "the sources used to investigate each method also need to meet the distinct detection thresholds for each selection method because of their dependence on the external wise and vhs catalogs .",
    "the results of our analyses are summarized in table [ tab : summary ] and figure [ fig : summary_peters ] .",
    "figure [ fig : normalization ] shows the fraction of sources that meet the selection - dependent thresholds ( i.e @xmath22 from table [ tab : summary ] ) for each selection method as a function of the des @xmath6-band magnitude .",
    "the completeness and efficiency values both have statistical poissonian uncertainties due to the actual number of quasars in this study , and systematic uncertainties due to cosmic variance in the quasar population and the characteristics of the des data for the s1 and s2 fields . for a typical sample size of 300 ( 50 ) quasars in the faint ( bright ) samples used in this study , the statistical uncertainties are on the order of 8% ( 18% @xmath23 22% ) and these serve as guidelines to compare the relative performance of the selection methods .",
    "these percentages correspond to one - sided , 90% confidence limits .",
    "we calculated the surface densities of quasars and all candidates ( quasars and non - quasars ) selected by each selection method , also shown in table [ tab : summary ] .",
    "as the area of stripe 82 is more precisely known than the overlap between des s1 and s2 fields with stripe 82 , and partly because cosmic variance is smaller over a larger region , the surface densities are calculated using the overall p15 quasar surface densities , rather than using the sources in the des s1 and s2 fields alone . for their `` good '' quasar candidates (  [ sec : peters_cat ] ) , the p15 catalog has a surface density @xmath24 = 132.79 deg@xmath25 at @xmath26 @xmath7 22 mag and @xmath27 = 24.36 deg@xmath25 at @xmath26 @xmath7 19.9 mag .",
    "the surface density of quasars @xmath28 and all candidates @xmath29 ( quasars and non - quasars ) selected by a selection method is then @xmath28 = @xmath30 @xmath22 @xmath31 and @xmath29 = @xmath30 @xmath22 @xmath31/@xmath32 = @xmath28/@xmath32 , where @xmath30 refers to either @xmath33 or @xmath34 , @xmath22 is from table [ tab : summary ] , @xmath31 is the completeness , and @xmath32 is the efficiency . the surface density of selected non - quasars is simply @xmath29 @xmath23 @xmath28 .",
    "while variability selection gives the highest surface density , the selection efficiency is one of the lowest and this results in a significant fraction of contaminants . among individual selection methods ,",
    "@xmath11 returns the highest quasar surface density , although it has a lower efficiency than @xmath12 and ` xdqsoz ` . for combined selection methods , ` xdqsoz`+variability is more efficient than @xmath12+variability and @xmath11+variability but also returns lower quasar surface density .",
    "the @xmath11+variability selection gives the highest quasar surface density among the three combined selection methods .",
    "taking both the surface densities of selected quasars and selection efficiencies into account , ` xdqsoz ` selection alone and a combination of color or ` xdqsoz ` with variability result in relatively high surface densities of quasars and a modest amount of contamination .",
    "the most significant drawback for both the @xmath12 and ` xdqsoz ` methods is that the wise data are only available for 55% of the quasars with @xmath6 @xmath7 22 mag , as both @xmath8 and @xmath9 detections are required .",
    "while the @xmath11 selection method has lower efficiency , it will produce a higher surface density of quasars because a @xmath9 detection is not required .",
    "since we used only photometry from the first year of des operations , we employed a simple multi - band @xmath4 to detect variability . variability selection based on more sophisticated quasar variability models , such as the damped random walk model , is deferred to the future when substantially more epochs will be available .",
    "the combination of the @xmath12 , @xmath11 , or ` xdqsoz ` methods with variability improves the efficiency of quasar selection ( fewer false positives ) at slightly lower completeness . at the bright end ,",
    "@xmath12+variability and ` xdqsoz`+variability can be applied in the des supernova fields , but the fraction of sources with wise detections will diminish for fainter sources .",
    "the @xmath11 or @xmath11+variability selection method can be used instead , particularly because they both return high quasar surface densities , and in the case of @xmath11+variability , with good selection efficiency .",
    "the depth of wise data is less of an issue for the shallower fields .",
    "although variability selection will not be as useful in these fields because of the small number of epochs , @xmath12 , @xmath11 or ` xdqsoz ` selection would be a good alternative .",
