    "canonical quantization of general relativity has a long history beginning in the 1960s  @xcite .",
    "basically , metric and its conjugate momentum had been used as canonical variables in these early days . in this case , the hamiltonian constraint is nonpolynomial about these variables .",
    "so , it is almost impossible to solve its quantized counterpart . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that if we use the complex ashtekar connection and its conjugate , the hamiltonian constraint can be written as polynomial about these variables .",
    "surprisingly , it was found that wilson loop for this connection is a solution of quantized hamiltonian constraint  @xcite . using wilson loop , spin network , basic ingredients of the loop quantum gravity(lqg ) ,",
    "has been constructed  @xcite .",
    "discrete area spectrum is one of the main predictions in lqg  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been recognized that the reality conditions for the physical quantities to be real are difficult to be solved .",
    "then , the su(2 ) real connection has been introduced where imaginary number @xmath0 in the complex ashtekar connection was replaced by the real parameter @xmath1 called the barbero - immirzi(bi ) parameter  @xcite .",
    "although the hamiltonian constraint becomes nonpolynomial , this complication can be relieved if we rewrite it using the technique developed in  @xcite .",
    "if we apply it in the symmetry - reduced model , we can discuss singularity avoidance which has been paid much attention  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of black hole entropy in lqg had also been discussed in @xcite , where the number of degrees of freedom of the edge configuration for a fixed su(2 ) area spectrum was counted .",
    "then , ashtekar , baez , corichi , and krasnov refined this idea based on the isolated horizon framework ( so - called abck framework where the isolated horizon itself was described by u(1 ) connection  @xcite ) and determined @xmath1 to satisfy the bekenstein - hawking entropy - area law @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are black hole entropy , horizon area and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "here , ambiguity of @xmath1 turned out to be the merit of using the real connection . including the correction of error in original counting @xcite , or ambiguity in counting @xcite , relation with the quasinormal mode  @xcite ,",
    "various aspects have been discussed related to the abck framework  @xcite .",
    "the situation slightly changed when it was found that the isolated horizon can be written using the su(2 ) connection  @xcite .",
    "this means that the horizon hilbert space can be described by the su(2 ) chern - simons state .",
    "its dimension is written by the spin freedom @xmath6 and the level of the chern - simons state @xmath7 . using a suitable analytic continuation of these variables to complex variables",
    ", it was obtained that the complex ashtekar connection is desirable to reproduce @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when we introduce the geometric temperature by demanding the horizon state be a kubo - martin - schwinger state , we can also arrive at the complex connection  @xcite .",
    "is there an essential reason why the complex ashtekar connection is preferable ? one of the reasons would be that the covariance is satisfied in this connection while it is violated in the real connection @xcite .",
    "this should be taken seriously , and we should pay attention how to choose the lorentz covariant connection which has been investigated in @xcite . the connection obtained in @xcite",
    "is called shifted connection which includes the bi parameter .",
    "surprisingly , the hamiltonian constraint can be written as a polynomial equation in this case again . using a shifted connection , covariant",
    "lqg has been formulated , and covariant area spectrum has been obtained  @xcite . making",
    "the consistent relation between covariant lqg and the spin foam models became the important realm recently  @xcite .",
    "we should also notice that the covariant area spectrum does not include the bi parameter although the shifted connection itself does .",
    "then , it is natural to ask whether or not we can obtain consistency with the entropy - area law if we consider counting microscopic freedom of black holes in covariant lqg . in @xcite , by assuming the horizon area consists of the minimum area eigenvalue , it was argued that the answer is in the affirmative .    here",
    ", we consider the generality of the holographic bound and argue the correction term of the entropy - area law discussed in @xcite .",
    "these are motivated by the quasilocal first law of black hole thermodynamics where the quasilocal energy is defined using the horizon area  @xcite .",
    "then , regarding the puncture , which is an intersection of the edge at the horizon , as a particle , we can argue its statistical mechanics .",
    "one of the important points in @xcite is that if we assume the degeneracy of matter fields close to the horizon as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath9 must approach @xmath10 in the large area limit when punctures are indistinguishable .",
    "the correction term of the entropy - area law is basically proportional to @xmath11 unless we assume the special form for the fugacity .",
    "then , our concerns are whether these properties hold or not in the covariant area spectrum .",
    "the answer is in the affirmative for the holographic bound while the correction term depends on the ambiguity of the covariant area spectrum as we discuss later .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce tools necessary for constructing puncture statistics following @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the case when maxwell - boltzmann statistics with a gibbs factor for punctures is assumed .",
    "we establish formulae which relate physical quantities such as horizon area to the parameter characterizing holographic degrees of freedom .",
    "we also perform numerical calculations and obtain consistency with these formulae .",
    "these results show that the holographic bound is saturated in the large area limit and that the correction term of the entropy - area law can be proportional to @xmath12 . in section iv",
    ", we consider the case when bose - einstein statistics is assumed and argue that the above formulae are also useful in this case . by applying the formulae , we can understand the intrinsic features of bose - einstein condensate which corresponds to the case when black holes almost consist of punctures in the ground state . we show that when this phenomena occurs , the area is approximately constant against the parameter characterizing the temperature .",
    "when this phenomena is broken , the area shows rapid increase which suggests the phase transition from quantum to classical area spectrum .",
    "concluding remarks follow in section v.",
    "following @xcite , we introduce several notions necessary for arguing puncture statistics .",
    "first , we mention the quasilocal law of black hole thermodynamics which holds for the stationary observer at proper distance @xmath13 from the horizon  @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is quasilocal horizon energy of black hole . we rewrite ( [ quasilocal-1st ] ) using the inverse unruh temperature @xmath16 as @xmath17 then , we can discuss the energy spectrum of the puncture by combining ( [ quasilocal - unruh ] ) with the area spectrum . in @xcite , the su(2 ) area spectrum written as @xmath18 has been used . here , @xmath19 is a half - integer associated with the puncture @xmath0 . here , we use the covariant area spectrum written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a half - integer with @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a real number  @xcite .",
    "notice that there is no ambiguity related to @xmath1 . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that it is enough for counting the degrees of freedom to consider the simple representation @xmath24 , which we assume here .",
    "the important point is how to determine @xmath23 .",
    "the relation ( [ quasilocal-1st ] ) and the spectrum ( [ general ] ) show that the puncture @xmath0 has quasilocal energy @xmath25 thus , the simplest possibility is to choose @xmath26 , which we include considering below .",
    "the next simplest possibility would be to regard @xmath23 as a dependent variable of @xmath19 . in this case , @xmath27 does not necessarily correspond to the ground state , which is important when we discuss bose - einstein condensate as shown in @xcite .",
    "although it is an interesting possibility , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath28 is monotonic with @xmath19 as a first extension of the previous case in @xcite . here ,",
    "we choose @xmath29 as @xmath30 which correspond to the cases , @xmath31 in the limit @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the reason why we choose a monomial or an exponential as ( [ function - form0 ] ) is supposed by the observation that only the qualitative behavior in the limit @xmath32 determines the holographic property and the correction term of the entropy - area law in @xcite .",
    "let us consider puncture statistics .",
    "in general , we do not require that the inverse temperature is equal to @xmath33 .",
    "we write the inverse temperature @xmath34 using @xmath33 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a parameter .",
    "we only demand that @xmath36 vanishes in the semiclassical limit @xmath37 to satisfy the relation ( [ quasilocal - unruh ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath38 as the number of punctures carrying spin @xmath6 and @xmath39 as the total number of punctures .",
    "so , we have @xmath40 we also define @xmath41 as the number of holographic degrees of freedom for a given configuration @xmath42 . here , we assume @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a free parameter .",
    "we suppose that the freedom @xmath41 comes from the matter fields close to the horizon motivated by the entanglement entropy hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "we include the gibbs factor @xmath46 in the maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "the case without the gibbs factor is discussed later in this section . then the canonical partition function @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 here , we abbreviate the puncture index @xmath0 and write the spin index @xmath6 in the quasilocal energy as @xmath49 using ( [ degeneracy ] )",
    ", we can express the partition function as @xmath50 where @xmath51 here , we defined @xmath52 we introduce the fugacity @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a chemical potential . in this case , we can express the grand canonical partition function by @xmath55 the total number @xmath39 and the mean energy @xmath15 are @xmath56 we can express the entropy as @xmath57 as we said above , we required @xmath58 in the limit @xmath59 .",
    "so , if @xmath60 , the correction term of the entropy - area law proportional to @xmath39 disappears as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "since one of the purposes using the covariant area spectrum is to investigate the correction term , we consider the case @xmath61 .",
    "in other treatments , it is often argued that the correction term proportional to @xmath62 appears  @xcite . from ( [ n ] ) and ( [ mean - energy ] ) , we have @xmath63 thus , in discussing the ratio between @xmath64 and the correction term , it is enough if we investigate the ratio between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath67 plays a minor role for this reason , we set @xmath68 below , for simplicity .",
    "how can we estimate the relation between @xmath66 and @xmath4 ? we should first notice that convergence of the sequence ( [ correction - term ] ) highly depends on @xmath69 .",
    "so , our strategy is to analyze the dependencies of @xmath66 and @xmath4 as a function of @xmath69 for obtaining the relation between @xmath66 and @xmath4 .",
    "since it would be difficult in calculating ( [ correction - term ] ) exactly , we suppose using numerical calculation . in this case , it is important to know @xmath70 we should sum up , which is a key to understand above property . in concrete , we assume that we need to sum up from @xmath71 to @xmath70 in obtaining the value @xmath72 for enough precision toward the true value @xmath66 , e.g. , relative error @xmath73 .",
    "to accomplish the above task , we need to estimate the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath69 as a first step , which is also a difficult task , in general .",
    "however , we can expect that @xmath74 in the limit @xmath75 , and we can estimate ( [ correction - term ] ) using the asymptotic form in the limit @xmath76 . for this reason , we assume @xmath77 .    let us consider the cases ( [ energy - asymptotic0 ] ) .",
    "if we have @xmath78 @xmath79 in @xmath76 , we can write as @xmath80\\ , \\label{correction - evaluate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 .",
    "if we define @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we can rewrite as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    using these notations",
    ", we comment on following important properties .",
    "if we reduce @xmath87 ,    \\(i ) we should change @xmath88 in preserving the same precision .",
    "\\(ii ) we obtain @xmath89 approximately .    to understand these properties",
    ", we should first notice that interval @xmath90 in the sum ( [ correction - key ] ) becomes @xmath91 while @xmath92 does not change by ( i ) .",
    "this means that there are @xmath93 terms we should sum up in the former case while @xmath94 terms in the latter case in ( [ correction - key ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath89 approximately . since @xmath95 , we also have @xmath96 approximately . therefore , we have same relative error and the precision is preserved .    for this approximation to be valid , following conditions should hold .    *",
    "changing @xmath97 is negligible .",
    "* @xmath98 does not have the property , + @xmath99 , or @xmath100 .",
    "the former assumption is implicitly used when we use the asymptotic form in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "the latter assumption holds when @xmath69 is small enough in the above case .    from these consideration ,",
    "we obtain @xmath101 since @xmath102 , we also have @xmath103 we mention that our results ( [ delta - q - relation ] ) and ( [ delta - a - relation ] ) are consistent with those in @xcite where ( [ su(2 ) ] ) was used which corresponds to the case @xmath104 .    next , we consider the case @xmath105 in @xmath76 . in this case , we can write as @xmath106 as in the previous case , if we want to obtain @xmath107 @xmath108 , we need to change the number of terms we should sum up from @xmath109 to @xmath110 @xmath108 for preserving the precision .",
    "this means that @xmath69 should change to satisfy @xmath111 so we have @xmath112 .",
    "this means @xmath113 . as a result , we have @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a constant .",
    "so we have @xmath116 the formulae ( [ delta - q - relation ] ) , ( [ delta - a - relation ] ) , ( [ delta - q - relation2 ] ) , and ( [ delta - a - relation2 ] ) play quite important roles in this paper .",
    "if we use the relations @xmath117 , ( [ quasilocal-1st ] ) , and ( [ delta - a - relation ] ) , we obtain @xmath118 the case of ( [ delta - a - relation2 ] ) is included in the limit @xmath119 .",
    "it is surprising that fluctuations of both energy and horizon area are summarized in this simple manner .    in the above estimate",
    ", we used the asymptotic form in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "thus , it is desirable to check consistency using a numerical calculation . for this purpose",
    ", we choose @xmath120 which correspond to the cases , @xmath121 in the limit @xmath76 , respectively",
    ". however , we stress that we use the exact expression ( [ e - spin ] ) by substituting ( [ function - form ] ) .",
    "we show @xmath69-@xmath66 , @xmath64 relations in figs .",
    "[ delta - mb ] which have complete consistency with ( [ delta - q - relation ] ) , ( [ delta - a - relation ] ) , ( [ delta - q - relation2 ] ) , and ( [ delta - a - relation2 ] ) . especially , in all cases , @xmath37 for @xmath75 .",
    "so we confirmed that the holographic bound is saturated , i.e. , @xmath122 , in the semiclassical limit where the temperature should approach unruh temperature @xmath123 .",
    "this is a generalization of the result in @xcite .",
    "then , we should also notice the results @xmath124 for @xmath125 derived by ( [ delta - q - relation2 ] ) and ( [ delta - a - relation2 ] ) . to check its accuracy , we also show that @xmath126 is almost constant for @xmath125 in fig",
    ".  [ delta - correct ] .",
    "the deviation from constant for large @xmath69 would be due to it from the asymptotic form .",
    "so , we obtain the @xmath127 correction if we use the freedom @xmath128 .",
    "this is also our new results obtained by considering the covariant area spectrum .",
    "finally , we comment on the case without the gibbs factor . in this case , we have @xmath129 so , @xmath130 is required .",
    "however , it is impossible in the small @xmath69 as we see from ( [ delta - q - relation ] ) and ( [ delta - q - relation2 ] ) .",
    "here , we consider bose - einstein statistics as a candidate of the puncture statistics .",
    "first , we discuss the case @xmath68 as an extension of the case in maxwell - boltzmann statistics . in this case",

    "then , the discussion below ( [ correction - key ] ) holds , and we obtain ( [ delta - q - relation ] ) and ( [ delta - a - relation ] ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath135 , we obtain ( [ delta - q - relation2 ] ) and ( [ delta - a - relation2 ] ) .",
    "the conclusions are that we have a holographic bound in the large area limit , and the correction term of the entropy - area law behaves same as the case in maxwell - boltzmann statistics qualitatively .",
    "the result for @xmath104 is consistent with @xcite where the correction term is shown to be proportional to @xmath11 both in maxwell - boltzmann statistics and in bose - einstein statistics .",
    "we have shown that these can be understood in an unified way including the cases in covariant area spectrum .",
    "next , we discuss the case @xmath136 .",
    "the grand canonical partition function can be written as @xmath137^{-1}\\ .\\label{grand - canonicalbe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , we should require @xmath138 since we assumed that @xmath139 is monotonic function with @xmath6 , we obtain @xmath140 as an extension of @xcite .",
    "so , the high temperature region with @xmath141 should be described by a maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "we concentrate on the case with @xmath142 .",
    "we consider whether or not above discussion can be extendible for the case @xmath136 .",
    "we define @xmath143\\ .\\label{lnbe2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the rhs of this equation includes two independent parameters @xmath36 and @xmath45 . to avoid complication",
    ", we set @xmath144 below .",
    "then , if we have @xmath133 in @xmath76 , we replace @xmath145 by @xmath146 $ ] to perform an analogous discussion .",
    "however , in this case , @xmath147 does not necessarily satisfy * conditions * in the previous section .",
    "this depends on the ratio between @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in concrete , if @xmath148 is small enough , @xmath150 can be much smaller than @xmath151 . of course ,",
    "if we take @xmath152 , we can obtain same conclusion as above .",
    "below , we consider the case where * conditions * are violated .",
    "we can understand physical meaning of * conditions * by using the number of punctures @xmath38 for general @xmath153 . here ,",
    "@xmath38 is represented by @xmath154^{-1}\\ .\\label{number}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define @xmath155 if @xmath156 , the mean number of the grand state can be approximated as @xmath157 which is quite large .",
    "thus , @xmath158 is possible , which corresponds to the case @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , the total sum of the mean number @xmath160 , @xmath161 can be much smaller than @xmath162 which corresponds to the bose - einstein condensate state defined as a state where the horizon is almost dominated by spin @xmath163 puncture . since @xmath38 ( @xmath164 ) can satisfy * conditions * , @xmath165 can be estimated by following the analogous discussion as above .",
    "that is , if we have @xmath166 or @xmath167 in @xmath76 , we can estimate that @xmath168 or @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "so the criteria for the bose - einstein condensate are @xmath170 we show the relation between @xmath6 and its number density corresponding to @xmath171 or @xmath167 for @xmath172 and @xmath173 in fig .",
    "[ number4j ] .",
    "although both are the cases of the bose - einstein condensate , decays of @xmath38 make a contrast in these cases .",
    "we are interested in changes of physical quantities caused by the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we show @xmath64 as a function of @xmath69 for the case @xmath173 in fig .",
    "[ delta - be ] .",
    "surprisingly , plateau appears for large @xmath69 while @xmath64 increases as @xmath75 following ( [ delta - a - relation ] ) or ( [ delta - a - relation2 ] ) for small @xmath69 . if we use the criteria ( [ be1 ] ) and ( [ be2 ] ) , the bose - einstein condensate occurs for all @xmath69 in this diagram .",
    "then , how can we understand this plateau ?",
    "we can discuss that @xmath64 in the plateau corresponds to the case where @xmath64 almost consists of the area spectrum @xmath71 , @xmath174 .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "to estimate the area @xmath175 consisting of the area spectrum @xmath160 , we use @xmath176 if @xmath166 in @xmath76 , we have @xmath177 where we used ( [ delta - q - relation ] ) and ( [ delta - a - relation ] ) .",
    "so , if @xmath69 is small enough , first term of rhs in ( [ general - a ] ) can be negligible .",
    "thus , we have @xmath178 similarly , we can consider the case @xmath179 in @xmath76 and this case is included in the limit @xmath180 in ( [ a - ex ] ) .",
    "so the condition for @xmath181 can be estimated as @xmath182 we can find that this is consistent with the results in fig .  [ delta - be ] .",
    "this result is also newly revealed in this paper .",
    "if we consider what observables in black hole physics are , we may adopt the criterion ( [ criterion ] ) as a condition for the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "when this condition is broken , @xmath64 shows rapid grow as @xmath75 .",
    "if we can discuss this phenomena as a phase transition from the quantum black hole to the classical black hole , it is very interesting .",
    "we have investigated the puncture statistics based on the covariant area spectrum .",
    "first , we have considered maxwell - boltzmann statistics with a gibbs factor for punctures .",
    "if we assume the fugacity @xmath136 , we have reconfirmed the results in @xcite that the correction term of the entropy - area law disappears for @xmath60 .",
    "when we assume the fugacity @xmath68 , we have established formulae which relate physical quantities such as horizon area to the parameter characterizing holographic degrees of freedom using asymptotic form of the area spectrum in the large spin limit .",
    "we have also performed numerical calculations and obtained consistency with these formulae . from these results",
    ", we have obtained that the holographic bound is satisfied in the large area limit which is the extension of the previous research .",
    "we have found that the correction term of the entropy - area law can be proportional to the logarithm of the horizon area as it has been pointed out in other researches .",
    "second , we have also considered bose - einstein statistics and shown that above formulae are also useful in this case . by applying the formulae ,",
    "we have understood intrinsic features of the bose - einstein condensate which correspond to the case when the horizon area almost consists of punctures in the ground state .",
    "we have shown that when this phenomena occurs , the area is approximately constant against the parameter @xmath69 characterizing the temperature . when this phenomena is broken , the area shows a rapid increase as @xmath75 , which suggests the phase transition from quantum to classical area .",
    "what should we consider as a next step ?",
    "although we have assumed that @xmath183 is a dependent function of @xmath6 , the validity should be checked by other method .",
    "for example , to reveal the property of @xmath183 in the covariant area spectrum and the puncture statistics , it is important to investigate the hawking radiation as in @xcite which is one of our future work .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss possibility of the phase transition using covariant area spectrum as in @xcite . in a long span",
    ", we should also investigate a covariant volume spectrum , which would lead us to the covariant loop quantum cosmology .",
    "this must be the interesting arena in the next decade .",

    "<S> we investigate puncture statistics based on the covariant area spectrum in loop quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider maxwell - boltzmann statistics with a gibbs factor for punctures . </S>",
    "<S> we establish formulae which relate physical quantities such as horizon area to the parameter characterizing holographic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform numerical calculations and obtain consistency with these formulae . </S>",
    "<S> these results tell us that the holographic bound is satisfied in the large area limit and correction term of the entropy - area law can be proportional to the logarithm of the horizon area .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we also consider bose - einstein statistics and show that the above formulae are also useful in this case . by applying the formulae , </S>",
    "<S> we can understand intrinsic features of bose - einstein condensate which corresponds to the case when the horizon area almost consists of punctures in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> when this phenomena occurs , the area is approximately constant against the parameter characterizing the temperature . when this phenomena is broken , the area shows rapid increase which suggests the phase transition from quantum to classical area . </S>"
