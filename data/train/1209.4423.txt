    "in this paper , we study harnack inequalities for solutions of second - order parabolic equations of non - divergence type on riemannian manifolds .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth , complete riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , let @xmath4 be a positive definite symmetric endomorphism of @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is the tangent space of @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "we denote @xmath8 and @xmath9 and assume that @xmath10 for some positive constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we consider a second - order , linear , uniformly parabolic operator @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes composition of endomorphisms and @xmath16 denotes the hessian of the function @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the gradient of @xmath17 at @xmath7 .",
    "notice that in the special case when @xmath20 , the equation @xmath21 simply becomes the usual heat equation @xmath22 .    in the elliptic setting , cabr proved in a remarkable paper @xcite that if the underlying manifold @xmath6 has nonnegative sectional curvature , then krylov - safonov type ( elliptic ) harnack inequality holds for solutions of uniformly elliptic equations in non - divergence form .",
    "later , kim @xcite improved cabr s result by removing the sectional curvature assumption and imposing a certain condition on distance function which , in the parabolic setting , should read as follows : for all @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the geodesic distance between @xmath26 and @xmath7 , @xmath27 denotes the cut locus of @xmath26 , and @xmath28 is some positive constant that is fixed by the operator @xmath29",
    ". we shall prove that if the above conditions and hold , then we have krylov - safonov harnack inequality for the parabolic operator @xmath13 ; i.e. , if @xmath17 is a ( smooth ) nonnegative solution of @xmath30 in a cylinder @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 denotes the volume , and @xmath38 is a uniform constant depending only on @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is well known that the condition holds if the manifold @xmath6 has nonnegative ricci curvature .",
    "also , as it is proved in @xcite , the condition is satisfied , for example , if for all @xmath41 and any unit vector @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 \\ge 0 $ ] . here , @xmath44 is the ricci transformation of @xmath5 into itself given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the riemannian curvature tensor , and @xmath47=\\mathcal{m}^-[r(e),\\lambda , \\lambda]:=\\lambda \\sum_{\\kappa_i>0 } \\kappa_i + \\lambda \\sum_{\\kappa_i < 0 } \\kappa_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 are eigenvalues of the ( symmetric ) endomorphism @xmath44",
    ". in the case when @xmath13 is the heat operator and @xmath6 has nonnegative ricci curvature , then the condition @xmath43\\ge 0 $ ] is satisfied and thus the harnack inequality holds ; i.e. , if @xmath6 has nonnegative ricci curvature , then we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a constant that depends only on the dimension @xmath1 .",
    "this , in particular implies the harnack inequality of li and yau @xcite . also , in the case when @xmath6 has nonnegative sectional curvature , then the condition @xmath43\\ge 0 $ ] is trivially satisfied and we have the inequality with a constant @xmath38 depending only on @xmath51 , which especially reproduces the harnack inequality by krylov and safonov @xcite in the euclidean space .    one crucial ingredient in proving the euclidean krylov - safonov harnack inequality is the krylov - tso estimate , which is the parabolic counterpart of the aleksandrov - bakelman - pucci ( abp ) estimate . the krylov - tso estimate as well as the classical abp estimate is proved using affine functions , which have no intrinsic interpretation in general riemannian manifolds . in the elliptic case ,",
    "cabr ingeniously overcame this difficulty by replacing the affine functions by quadratic functions ; quadratic functions have geometric meaning as the square of distance functions .",
    "following cabr s approach , we introduce an intrinsically geometric version of krylov - tso normal map , namely , @xmath52 the map @xmath53 is called the parabolic normal map related to @xmath54 .",
    "a few remarks are in order regarding the normal map . in the classical abp ( and krylov - tso ) estimate , an affine function concerning with the ( elliptic ) normal map @xmath55 plays a role to bound the maximum of @xmath17 by estimating the measure of the image of the normal map .",
    "since an affine function can not be generalized naturally to an intrinsic object in riemannian manifolds , cabr used paraboloids instead in @xcite .",
    "the map @xmath56 is considered ( up to a sign ) as the legendre transform of @xmath17 .",
    "krylov @xcite discovered the parabolic version of the aleksandrov - bakelman maximum principle and tso @xcite later simplified his proof by using the map @xmath57 we end the introduction by stating our main theorems .",
