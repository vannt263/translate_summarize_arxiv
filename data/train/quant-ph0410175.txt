    "permanently coupled quantum chains have recently been proposed as prototypes of reliable quantum communication lines  @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of these schemes is related with the fact that even in the absence of external noise the fidelity of the transmission is in general not optimal  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the dispersion which affects the propagation of local excitations  @xcite . one way to overcome",
    "this is to engineer specific coupling hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "however , the more a scheme relies on particular properties of the hamiltonian , the more it will be affected by imperfections in its implementation @xcite .",
    "a more general approach was taken in @xcite where a specific encoding using time - dependent couplings at the sending and receiving end of the chain achieved high fidelity transfer .",
    "perfect transfer ( i.e. unitary fidelity ) for a whole class of unmodulated quantum chains was finally achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite by employing a parallel channel encoding where the sender of the message is able to transmit one qubit of information by operating on the first spins of two non interacting copies of the chain . in quantum information theory the ratio @xmath1 between the number qubits that can be transferred with unitary fidelity and",
    "the number of channel copies used in the protocol is an important efficiency parameter  @xcite .",
    "therefore one question that naturally arises is whether or not there is any special meaning in the 1/2 value of @xmath1 achieved in the protocol of ref .",
    "more specifically we pose the following question : can we use almost _ any _ quantum chain for perfect and efficient ( i.e. @xmath2 ) quantum communication ? in this article , we give a sufficient and easily attainable condition for achieving this goal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model and the notation are introduced in sec .",
    "[ s : sec1 ] . the efficiency and the fidelity of the protocol",
    "are discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : sec2 ] and in sec .",
    "[ s : sec3 ] , respectively . finally in sec .",
    "[ s : sec4 ] we prove a theorem which provides us with a sufficient condition for achieving efficient and perfect state transfer in quantum chains .",
    "consider a linear chain of @xmath3 spins interacting through the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath5 , we define the single excitation vector @xmath6-th spin is in the computational base vector @xmath7 and the remaining @xmath8 qubits are in the state @xmath9 .",
    "analogously we define @xmath10 to be the state where all spins are in @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 is an eigenvector of @xmath4 and that the @xmath3-dimensional subspace generated by the states @xmath12 is invariant under the time evolution @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 is the probability amplitude that the excitation @xmath12 moves to @xmath15 in the time interval @xmath16 . a sufficient criterion for eq .",
    "( [ output ] ) is that @xmath4 commutes with the z component of the total spin .",
    "a typical example is provided by a linear array of spins with heisenberg interaction . in the original proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite one assumes that initially the chain is in @xmath17 and that at time @xmath18 a first party ( alice ) encodes one qubit of logical information in the first spin by preparing the chain in @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 complex . by reading out",
    "the state of the @xmath3-th qubit at time @xmath16 a second party ( bob ) will be able to recover the information transmitted .",
    "assume now that the two communicating parties operate on @xmath0 independent ( i.e. non interacting ) copies of the chain  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use these copies to improve the overall fidelity of the communication . as in the original scheme  @xcite we assume alice and bob to control respectively the first and last qubit of each chain ( see fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] ) . by preparing any superposition of her spins alice can in principle transfer up to @xmath0 logical qubits",
    ". however , in order to improve the communication fidelity the two parties will find it more convenient to redundantly encode only a small number ( say @xmath22 ) of logical qubits in the @xmath0 spins . by adopting these strategies alice and bob",
    "are effectively sacrificing the efficiency @xmath23 of their communication line in order to increase its fidelity .",
    "this is typical of any communication scheme and it is analogous to what happens in quantum error correction theory , where a single logical qubit is stored in many physical qubits . by focusing on those strategies that guarantee a ( possibly asymptotic in @xmath0 ) unitary fidelity in the transmission of the @xmath24 encoded qubits ,",
    "the efficiency @xmath25 yields the capacity of the channel  @xcite . in the case of the quantum chains  ( [ output ] )",
    "it has been proved  @xcite the existence of an encoding of efficiency @xmath26 which allows for unitary fidelity , by showing that for @xmath27 it is possible to achieve perfect state transfer of a single logical qubit by using just two copies of the original chain . here",
    "we will generalize such result by proving that given @xmath28 there exist an optimal encoding - decoding strategy which asymptotically allows to achieve perfect state transfer of @xmath24 qubits such that @xmath29 in other words we show the possibility of achieving both perfect transfer _ and _ optimal efficiency .",
    "our strategy requires alice to prepare superpositions of the @xmath0 chains where @xmath30 of them have a single excitation in the first location while the remaining are in @xmath11 . since in the limit",
    "@xmath31 the number of qubit transmitted is @xmath32 , this architecture guarantees optimal efficiency  ( [ efficiency ] ) . on the other hand , our protocol requires bob to perform collective measurements on his spins to determine if all the @xmath30 excitations alice is transmitting arrived at his location .",
    "we will prove that by repeating these detections many times , bob is able to recover the messages with asymptotically perfect fidelity .      before beginning the analysis let us introduce some notation . in order to distinguish the @xmath0 different chains we introduce the label @xmath33 : in this formalism @xmath34 represents the state  ( [ excitation ] ) of @xmath35-th chain with a single excitation in the @xmath36-th spin .",
    "in the following we will be interested in those configurations of the whole system where @xmath37 chains posses a single excitation while the remaining @xmath38 are in @xmath17 , as in the case@xmath39 where for instance the first @xmath37 chains have an excitation in the first chain location .",
    "another more general example is given in fig .",
    "[ cap : example - of - our ] .",
    "the complete characterization of these vectors is obtained by specifying _",
    "i ) _ _ which _ chains possess a single excitation and _ ii ) _ _ where _ these excitations are located horizontally along the chains . in answering to the point _",
    "i ) _ we introduce the @xmath37-element subsets @xmath40 , composed by the labels of those chains that contain an excitation .",
    "each of these subsets @xmath40 corresponds to a subspace of the hilbert space @xmath41 with a dimension @xmath42 the total number of such subsets is equal to the binomial coefficient @xmath43 , which counts the number of possibilities in which @xmath37 objects ( excitations ) can be distributed amongst @xmath0 parties ( parallel chains ) . in particular for any @xmath44 the @xmath45-th subset @xmath40 will be specified by assigning its @xmath37 elements , i.e. @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 for all @xmath49 . to characterize the location of the excitations , point",
    "ii ) _ , we will introduce instead the @xmath37-dimensional vectors @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "we can then define @xmath52 is the complementary of @xmath40 to the whole set of chains .",
    "the state ( [ nvec ] ) represents a configuration where the @xmath53-th chain of the subset @xmath40 is in @xmath54 while the chains that do not belong to @xmath40 are in @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ cap : example - of - our ] for an explicit example ) .",
    "the kets @xmath55 are a natural generalization of the states @xmath56 and @xmath57 which were used for the `` dual - rail encoding '' in @xcite .",
    "they are useful for our purposes because they are mutually orthogonal , i.e. @xmath58 and their time evolution under the hamiltonian does not depend on @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "( [ time ] ) ) . among the vectors  ( [ nvec ] ) those where all the @xmath37 excitations are located at the beginning of the @xmath40 chains play an important role in our analysis . here @xmath59 and we can write @xmath60 ) , for @xmath44 these states form orthonormal set of @xmath43 elements",
    ". analogously by choosing @xmath61 we obtain the orthonormal set of @xmath43 vectors @xmath62 where all the @xmath37 excitations are located at the end of the chains .",
    "if all the @xmath0 chains of the system are originally in @xmath17 , the vectors  ( [ in ] ) can be prepared by alice by locally operating on her spins . moreover",
    "since these vectors span a @xmath43 dimensional subspace , alice can encode in the chain @xmath63 qubits of logical information by preparing the superpositions , @xmath64 complex coefficients .",
    "the efficiency of such encoding is hence @xmath65 which maximized with respect to @xmath37 gives , @xmath66 the stirling approximation can then be used to prove that this encoding is asymptotically efficient  ( [ efficiency ] ) in the limit of large @xmath0 , e.g. @xmath67 note that already for @xmath68 the encoding is more efficient ( cf .",
    "[ cap : example - of - our ] ) than in the `` dual - rail encoding '' given in @xcite . in the remaining of the paper",
    "we show that the encoding  ( [ logicstate ] ) provides perfect state transfer by allowing bob to perform joint measurements at its end of the chains .",
    "since the @xmath0 chains do not interact with each other and possess the same free hamiltonian @xmath4 ( this assumption can be relaxed , see @xcite ) , the unitary evolution of the whole system is described by @xmath69 , with @xmath70 being the operator  ( [ output ] ) acting on the @xmath35-th chain .",
    "the time evolved of the input @xmath71 of eq .",
    "( [ in ] ) is thus equal to @xmath72\\;|\\boldsymbol{\\vec{n}};\\ell\\rangle\\!\\rangle\\;,\\label{time}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is performed for all @xmath73 and @xmath74\\equiv f_{n_{1},n_{1}^{\\prime}}(t)\\cdots f_{n_{k},n_{k}^{\\prime}}(t)\\;,\\label{capitolf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a quantity which does _ not _ depend on @xmath45 . in eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) the term @xmath75 corresponds to having all the @xmath37 excitations in the last locations of the chains .",
    "we can thus write @xmath76 where @xmath77\\label{gamma1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the probability amplitude that all the @xmath37 excitation of @xmath71 arrive at the end of the chains , and @xmath78\\equiv\\frac{f[\\vec{n},\\vec{1};t]}{\\sqrt{1-|\\gamma_{1}(t)|^{2}}},\\label{eq:13b}\\ ] ] is a superposition of terms where the number of excitations arrived to the end of the communication line is strictly less then @xmath37 .",
    "it is worth noticing that eq .",
    "( [ ortho ] ) yields the following relations , @xmath79 which shows that @xmath80 is an orthonormal set of vectors which spans a subspace orthogonal to the states @xmath81 the time evolution of the input state  ( [ logicstate ] ) follows by linearity from eq .",
    "( [ time1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath82 and @xmath83 are unitary transformations of the input message  ( [ logicstate ] ) where the orthonormal set @xmath84 has been rotated into @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively . moreover @xmath87 is the configuration we need to have for perfect state transfer at the end of the chain .",
    "in fact it is obtained from the input message  ( [ logicstate ] ) by replacing the components @xmath88 ( excitation in the first spin ) with @xmath89 ( excitation in the last spin ) . from eq .",
    "( [ ortho1 ] ) we know that @xmath87 and @xmath83 are orthogonal .",
    "this property helps bob to recover the message @xmath87 from @xmath90 : he needs only to perform a collective measurement on the @xmath0 spins he is controlling to establish if there are @xmath37 or less excitations in those locations .",
    "the above is clearly a projective measure that can be performed without destroying the quantum coherence associated with the coefficients @xmath91 .",
    "formally this can described by introducing the observable @xmath92 a single measure of @xmath93 on @xmath94 yields the outcome @xmath95 with probability @xmath96 , and the outcome @xmath97 with probability @xmath98 . in the first case",
    "the system will be projected in @xmath87 and bob will get the message . in the second case instead",
    "the state of the system will become @xmath99 . already at this stage",
    "the two communicating parties have a success probability equal to @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , as in @xcite , the channels have been transformed into a quantum erasure channel @xcite where the receiver knows if the transfer was successful .",
    "consider now what happens when bob fails to get the right answer from the measure .",
    "the state on which the chains is projected is explicitly given by @xmath101 . by repeating the same analysis given above we obtain an expression similar to ( [ logicstateout ] ) , i.e. latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the property @xmath162 was employed .",
    "proving the thesis is hence equivalent to prove that for @xmath130 the succession @xmath163 nullifies .",
    "this last relation can be studied using properties of power bounded matrices  @xcite .",
    "in fact , by introducing the norm of the operator @xmath164 we have , @xmath165 where @xmath166 is a positive constant which does not depend on @xmath120 @xcite and where @xmath167 is the spectral radius of @xmath168 , i.e. the eigenvalue of @xmath168 with maximum absolute value ( n.b . even when @xmath168 is not diagonalizable this is a well defined quantity ) .",
    "equation  ( [ thesis ] ) shows that @xmath169 is a sufficient condition for @xmath170 . in our case",
    "we note that , given any normalized eigenvector @xmath171 of @xmath168 with eigenvalue @xmath172 we have @xmath173 is a projector .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "( [ thesis1 ] ) the identity holds only if @xmath174 is also an eigenvector of @xmath175 with eigenvalue @xmath97 , i.e. only if @xmath171 is orthogonal to @xmath149 . by definition @xmath171",
    "is eigenvector @xmath176 : therefore the only possibility to have the equality in eq .",
    "( [ thesis1 ] ) is that _",
    "i ) _ @xmath171 is an eigenvector of @xmath177 ( i.e. an eigenvector of the hamiltonian @xmath178 of the chain subset @xmath40 ) and _ ii ) _ it is orthogonal to @xmath149 . by negating the above statement",
    "we get a sufficient condition for the thesis .",
    "namely , if all the eigenvectors @xmath179 of @xmath178 are not orthogonal to @xmath149 than the absolute values of the eigenvalues @xmath172 of @xmath168 are strictly smaller than @xmath129 which implies @xmath169 and hence the thesis . since the @xmath40 channels are identical and do not interact , the eigenvectors @xmath180 are tensor product of eigenvectors @xmath133 of the single chain hamiltonians @xmath4 . using the notation introduced in eq .",
    "( [ excitation ] ) the sufficient condition becomes @xmath181 which can be satisfied only if @xmath182 for all eigenvectors @xmath133 of the single chain hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "while we have proved here that for equal time intervals the probability of success is converging to unity , in practice one may use _ optimal _ measuring time intervals for a faster transfer  @xcite .",
    "we also point out that timing errors may delay the transfer , but will not decrease the asymptotic fidelity .",
    "it is worth noticing that eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) is a very week condition , which is satisfied for _ any _ open nearest - neighbor quantum chain as long as the transition amplitude @xmath183 from alice to bob ( cf .",
    "( [ output ] ) ) is not identical to zero .",
    "let us prove this by contradiction : assume there exists a normalized eigenvector @xmath184 of the single chain hamiltonian @xmath4 such that @xmath185 because @xmath184 is an eigenstate , we can conclude that also @xmath186 if we act with the hamiltonian on the ket in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_null ] ) we may get some term proportional to @xmath187 ( corresponding to an ising - like interaction ) and some part proportional to @xmath188 ( corresponding to a hopping term ; if this term did not exist , then clearly @xmath189 for all times ) . we can thus conclude that @xmath190 note that for a closed chain , e.g. a ring , this need not be the case , because then also a term proportional to @xmath191 would occur .",
    "if we insert the hamiltonian into eq .",
    "( [ eq : steptwo ] ) again , we can use the same reasoning to see that @xmath192 and hence @xmath193 which is a contradiction to @xmath184 being normalized .",
    "we thus conclude that any nearest - neighbor hamiltonian that can transfer quantum information with nonzero fidelity ( including the heisenberg chains analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) is capable of efficient and perfect transfer when used in the context of parallel chains .",
