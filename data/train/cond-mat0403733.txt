    "we now dope the half - filled state @xmath56 with two holes and consider the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath1 ) . in this limit",
    ", there will be an energy cost of order @xmath57 if the two holes are _ not _ nn . hence , to zeroth order , the ( highly degenerate ) two - hole ground state is spanned by the set of all nn hole pairs .",
    "we denote the state with a horizontal nn hole pair at sites @xmath58 and @xmath59 as @xmath60 and the state with a vertical nn hole pair at sites @xmath58 and @xmath61 @xmath62 the @xmath63 s and @xmath64 s provide a complete , orthonormal basis for the two - hole ground state of @xmath46 corresponding to @xmath56 .",

    "<S> we analytically calculate the ground state pairing symmetry and excitation spectra of two holes doped into the half - filled @xmath0 model in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath1 ) . in leading order , </S>",
    "<S> this reduces to the @xmath2 model , where there are regions of @xmath3-wave , @xmath4-wave , and ( degenerate ) @xmath5-wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath6 model maps in lowest order onto the @xmath2 model on the boundary between @xmath3 and @xmath5 symmetry , with a flat lower band in the pair excitation spectrum . in higher order , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3-wave symmetry is selected from the lower pair band . </S>",
    "<S> however , we observe that the addition of the appropriate @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 , the signs of @xmath9 and @xmath10 found in the hole - doped cuprates , could drive the hole - pair symmetry to @xmath5-wave , implying the possibility of competition between @xmath5-wave and @xmath3-wave pair ground states . </S>",
    "<S> ( an added @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 generally tend to promote @xmath3-wave symmetry . ) </S>",
    "<S> we perturbatively construct an extended quasi - pair for the @xmath6 model . in leading order , </S>",
    "<S> there are contributions from sites at a distance of @xmath13 lattice spacings apart ; however , contributions from sites 2 lattice spacings apart , also of the same order , vanish identically . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare our approach with analytic calculations for a @xmath14 plaquette and with existing numerical work , and discuss possible relevance to the physical parameter regime . </S>"
