    "this kind of analysis helps us put galaxy scaling relationships in context with respect to one another as well as probe the underlying physics affecting galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "starting from the suggestions of @xcite that elliptical galaxies can be formed by the merger between spiral galaxies , there is growing evidence for a change in galaxy morphology ( e.g. @xcite ) and galaxy structure as a result of merger ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , at fixed color , the residual dependence of galaxy morphology on environmental density is reported to be rather weak @xcite . with an earlier release of sdss data ( dr4 ) @xcite showed that when a galaxy is located within the virial radius of its nearest neighbor , its morphology tends to be the same as that of the neighbor .",
    "this points to an important role of hydrodynamic interactions with neighbors within the virial radius .",
    "further studies comprising of galaxies in galaxy clusters @xcite , and involving hosts and their satellite galaxies @xcite seem to favor this proposition .    in regard to star formation activity , following zwicky s suggestion that collisions would be frequent within dense galaxy clusters",

    "star formation related properties , such as color and emission - line flux , are found to be directly correlated with environmental density @xcite .",

    "an additional visual check of color images is undertaken to account for possible incorrect morphological classification of about 10,000 galaxies having close neighbors .",

    "@xcite have reported a rapid increase in size of e - e galaxies at separations below 0.01@xmath86 but in our dataset such a merging sample of early type galaxies is absent . for the remaining cases also",
    "the size of galaxies does not show a significant change as the galaxy traverses the full @xmath0 - @xmath47 parameter space .",
    "@xcite reported a strong dependence of galaxy size on morphology and luminosity of the galaxy population . in this work",
    "we have fixed the morphology , restricted the change in magnitude to 1 mag and ommited galaxies from high density regions of the universe resulting into the measurements of petrosian radius that is essentially fixed across a range of background density and neighbor separation .",
    "in this paper we have studied various physical properties of mainly passively evolving field galaxies from low density regions of sdss .",
    "effects of the nearest neighbor distance , the nearest neighbor s morphology , and the large - scale background density are examined . in order to better understand the effect of the nearest neighbor galaxy",
    ", we have removed all those galaxies from our analysis that lie within the virial radius of their second nearest neighbor .",
    "we have hoped to remove the biases in galaxy properties due to morphology misclassification by using an accurate automated morphology classifier @xcite combined with careful visual inspection .",
    "mass transfer between interacting galaxies @xcite can help us better understand the reason for decrease in early type fraction of galaxies as the target galaxies approach a late type neighbor galaxy ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) within their virial radius . in such a scenario , the early type galaxy can acquire cold gas from the late type neighbor enabling the former to form a disk and transform itself to a late type galaxy @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] indicates that at fixed background density the isolated galaxies are comparatively brighter and among isolated galaxies the brighter ones lie in higher density environments .",
    "it can serve as the evidence of transformation of the galaxy luminosity class through the merger process .",
    "our analysis reconfirms the importance of radius of the galaxy plus dark halo systems as a distance scale inside which most of the galaxy properties start to be sensitive to both the nearest neighbor s distance and its morphology .",
    "the gravitationally bound pair of galaxies orbit each other within the virial radius resulting in repeated hydrodynamic interactions contributing to change in properties of the orbiting galaxies .",
    "our study emphasize the importance of neighbor galaxy s morphology in either enhancing or suppressing of star formation activity ( see e.g. middle column of figure [ fig6 ] ) of target galaxy which has long been assumed to only increase due to the internal mass perturbed by the tidal force of the neighbor @xcite .",
    "such a relation between morphology and star formation activity can be attributed to hydrodynamic interactions between approaching galaxies .",
    "ram pressure effects experienced due to the collision with the hot gas of the neighbor elliptical galaxy can explain the change in star formation activity of the late type galaxy . in order to analyze the robustness of our findings against the choice of neighbor selection parameter(@xmath56 ) , we restudied the behavior of equivalent width of @xmath87 line using different samples of galaxies that are constrained to have brighter as well as fainter neighbors than themselves .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] represents a scenarios in which the two distinct target galaxy populations exhibit similar behavior of @xmath80 as a function of neighbor separation .",
    "well inside the virial radius , @xmath80 decreases slightly as we traverse the galaxy populations having fainter neighbors ( solid cyan line , figure [ fig9 ] ) to those having brighter neighbors(dotted magenta line ) .",
    "we can fit the @xmath80 as a function of @xmath78 using the function @xmath88 where c is the measure of the value outside the virial radius of the neighbor .",
    "the slight decrease in @xmath80 as a function of neighbor brightness for passive galaxies may be related to exchange of gas between interacting galaxies .",
    "the additional role played by gravitational effects in the evolution of galaxies is evident by morphology independent structural parameter changes in figure [ fig7 ] as a function of neighbor separation .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] presents a comparatively larger variation in @xmath84 and @xmath67 for galaxy pairs that have smaller relative velocity , suggesting an inverse correlation between tidal energy deposits in a galaxy and velocity difference between pairs @xcite . the overall small variation in structural properties as a function of environments as evident in figure [ fig8 ] suggests these are less closely related to their ",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "major outcomes of our studies are as follows .",
    "* the properties of passive galaxies that are separated more than the one virial radius of the nearest neighbor are independent of the separation .",
    "initial dependence of physical property on the separation starts as soon as the galaxy enters the neighbor s virial radius with another change occurring at about 0.1 @xmath69 , which corresponds to @xmath89kpc for galaxies in our sample .",
    "* we do not observe a morphology density relation @xcite for passive galaxies in low density environments as indicated by nearly horizontal , constant @xmath66 contours in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the galaxy morphology mainly depends on the pair separation combined with morphology of the neighbor galaxy . *",
    "only luminosity of the passive galaxies show a dependence on @xmath47 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) especially at separations larger than virial radius of the neighbor .",
    "this corroborates the evidence regarding transformation of luminosities of passive galaxies through mergers @xcite .",
    "* at fixed morphology and luminosity , both sf activity as well as structural parameter of galaxies show a weak or negligible dependence on @xmath47 .",
    "variations in neighbor absolute magnitude does not vary the star formation activity of the target galaxy considerably ( figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the weak residual dependence on @xmath47 of the @xmath90 color of galaxies can be attributed to the presence of hotter and denser halo gas in galaxies in high density environments .",
