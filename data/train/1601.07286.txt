    "<S> using a first - principles noncollinear wave - function - matching method , we studied the spin - transfer torques ( stts ) in cofe / mg - b - o / cofe(001 ) magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) , where three different types of b - doped mgo in the spacer are considered , including b atoms replacing mg atoms ( mg@xmath0bo@xmath1 ) , b atoms replacing o atoms ( mg@xmath1bo@xmath0 ) , and b atoms occupying interstitial positions ( mg@xmath1bo@xmath1 ) in mgo . </S>",
    "<S> a strong asymmetric angular dependence of stt can be obtained both in ballistic cofe / mg@xmath0bo@xmath1 and cofe / mg@xmath1bo@xmath1 based mtjs , whereas a nearly symmetric stt curve is observed in the junctions based on cofe / mg@xmath1bo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the asymmetry of the angular dependence of stt can be suppressed significantly by the disorder of b distribution . </S>",
    "<S> such skewness of stts in the cofe / mg - b - o / cofe mtjs could be attributed to the interfacial resonance states induced by the b diffusion into mgo spacer . </S>",
    "<S> the present investigation demonstrates the feasibility of effectively enhancing microwave output power in mgo based spin torque oscillator ( sto ) by doping the b atoms into mgo spacer . </S>"
