    "determining the physical parameters of large samples of galaxies is crucial to constrain our knowledge of the complicated physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of these systems .",
    "ultimately , we seek methods that quickly and effectively map observed data from @xmath0 galaxies to sets of parameters that describe the star formation and chemical histories of these galaxies . due to the complexity of the mechanisms of galaxy evolution",
    ", it is critical that we adopt a model that uses few assumptions about how galaxies evolve .",
    "moreover , full utilization of the available theoretical stellar models , avoiding ad hoc simplifications , is critical to obtaining accurate parameter estimates .",
    "there has been a large amount of work dedicated to estimating the physical parameters of databases of galaxies using different types of data .",
    "for example , spectral indices ( @xcite ) , emission features ( @xcite ) , and full high - resolution , broad - band spectra ( @xcite ) have all been utilized to estimate the star formation histories ( sfhs ) and metallicities of galaxies .",
    "recently , due to the abundance of high - quality , homogeneous databases of galaxy spectra such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , which provides high - resolution spectra for hundreds of thousands of galaxies , the approach of full high - resolution spectral fitting is now possible to infer the properties of large populations of galaxies .",
    "recent work has shown promise in the application of these methods to sdss galaxy spectra ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews of results achieved by two such fitting methods ) . however ,",
    "large - scale analyses , while possible , are not necessarily accurate , and can be computationally challenging .",
    "there is much room for improvement in accuracy of sfh parameter estimation .",
    "it is critical that we understand the shortcomings of the current models and improve their accuracy . at the same time , to achieve our goal of obtaining accurate sfh estimates for a large sample of galaxies , we can not sacrifice the computational efficiency of current methods .",
    "a common technique in the literature , called empirical population synthesis , is to model galaxies as mixtures of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) with known physical parameters .",
    "recent studies that have used this method are , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . under this model ,",
    "galaxy data are treated as linear combinations of the observed properties of ssps .",
    "historically , ssp parameters and observables were derived from observations of well - understood stellar systems .",
    "more recent studies have instead used model - produced ssps , such as those from the evolutionary population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "the starlight spectral fitting code , introduced by @xcite , fits observed spectra with linear combinations of ssps from the models of @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that sfh parameters of simulated galaxy spectra could be recovered by starlight in the absence of noise . however , their simulated spectra were generated and fit with the _ same basis _ of 45 ssps , rendering the results difficult to generalize to the expected performance on real galaxies , which can be composed of ssps on infinitely fine grids of age and metallicity .",
    "results of the starlight fitting code are highly dependent on the choice of basis of ssp spectra .",
    "the database of ssps available to us could theoretically be infinitely large , encompassing all combinations of age , metallicity , initial mass function , evolutionary prescription , etc . including too many ssps in our basis causes the code to be prohibitively slow and the solution",
    "to be degenerate due to the inclusion of ssps with almost identical spectra .",
    "if , however , we simply hand - select a few ssps on a coarse grid of age and metallicity with which to model our data , then we effectively ignore large subsets of our ssp parameter space , leading to suboptimal estimates for fits to databases of galaxies .",
    "using a hand - selected basis of ssps may also lead to the inclusion of multiple ssps whose spectra are essentially identical , which can lead to degeneracies .",
    "there is much room for improvement in the accuracy of sfh estimates by exploring numerical methods of selecting small bases of ssps . in this paper , we propose a method of choosing a small set of _ prototype _ spectra from a large database of ssp spectra based on their observable quantities .",
    "our method attempts to capture much of the variability of a large set of ssps in a few numerically chosen prototype ssps .",
    "the method is based on the diffusion map of @xcite and @xcite , a non - linear technique that seeks a simple , natural representation of data that are complex and high - dimensional , such as high - resolution astronomical spectra .",
    "we utilize the _ diffusion @xmath1-means _ method to numerically find a basis of prototype ssps with which we can fit galaxies to accurately estimate their sfhs . in a future study",
    ", we will consider the problem of computational speed in methods such as starlight , which takes @xmath2 minutes to fit each sdss galaxy spectrum for a basis of size 150 , and show how to quickly extend the sfh estimates obtained by using the methods in this paper to a large database of galaxies by taking advantage of the geometry of the manifold on which the data lie .",
    "the applicability of the methods introduced here extend beyond the problem of sfh estimation using high - resolution spectra .",
    "any astronomical task where observed data ( i.e. spectra , photometric data , spectral indices , etc . )",
    "are fit as linear combinations of observable data from simpler systems can benefit from intelligent numerical selection of prototypes .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the starlight spectral synthesis code , discuss the drawbacks of ssp bases employed in the literature , and introduce the diffusion @xmath1-means method of prototype selection .",
    "we directly compare the basis of prototypes selected by our method to those used in the literature and those found using other methods . in ",
    "3 we fit several sets of realistic simulated galaxy spectra using the starlight code with different bases to directly compare the ability of each basis to accurately estimate galaxy parameters . in ",
    "4 we fit a set of sdss galaxy spectra and analyse physical parameter estimates obtained by different bases .",
    "we conclude with some remarks and discussion of future directions in  5 .",
    "we adopt the model of galaxy spectra as a mixture of simple systems introduced in @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the model flux in wavelength bin @xmath5 .",
    "the component @xmath6 is the @xmath7th basis spectrum normalized at wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "the basis of ssp spectra @xmath9 is chosen before performing the analysis .",
    "the scalar @xmath10 $ ] is the proportion of flux contribution of the @xmath7th component at @xmath8 , where @xmath11 ; the vector @xmath12 with components @xmath13 is the _ population vector _ of a galaxy .",
    "these flux fractions can be converted to mass fractions , @xmath14 , using the light - to - mass ratios of each basis spectrum @xmath15 at @xmath8 . to describe the sfh of a galaxy",
    ", we will use time - binned versions of @xmath12 and @xmath16 , denoted @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "using binned population vectors lets us avoid degeneracies that can occur in the estimation of the original population vectors .",
    "other components of the model in ( [ cfmodel ] ) are the scaling parameter @xmath19 , the reddening term , @xmath20 , and the gaussian convolution , @xmath21 .",
    "the reddening term describes distortion in the observed spectrum due to foreground dust , and is modeled by the extinction law of @xcite with @xmath22 .",
    "the gaussian convolution , @xmath21 , accounts for movement of stars within the observed galaxy with respect to our line - of - sight , and is parametrized by a central velocity @xmath23 and dispersion @xmath24 .",
    "to fit individual galaxies , we use the starlight fitting routine introduced by @xcite .",
    "the code uses a metropolis algorithm plus simulated annealing to find the minimum of @xmath25 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the observed flux in the wavelength bin @xmath5 , @xmath4 is the model flux in ( [ cfmodel ] ) , and @xmath27 is the inverse of the noise in the measurement @xmath26 .",
    "the summation is over the @xmath28 wavelength bins in the observed spectrum .",
    "the minimization of ( [ chisq ] ) is performed over @xmath29 parameters : @xmath30 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath1 is the number of basis spectra in @xmath31 .",
    "the speed of the algorithm scales as @xmath32 . for the analysis of , e.g. @xmath33 galaxy spectra in the sdss database , it is crucial to pick a basis with a small number of spectra .    in , for example , @xcite and @xcite , the starlight model ( [ cfmodel ] ) and fitting algorithm are tested using simulations .",
    "the simulated spectra are generated from the model in ( [ cfmodel ] ) using @xmath34 ssps from @xcite and @xmath35 ssps from @xcite , respectively .",
    "these authors fit the simulations using the same basis of ssps that was used to generate the simulations . from their analyses , they conclude that in the absence of noise , the algorithm accurately recovers the input parameters . in the presence of noise , the population vector @xmath12 is not recovered , and it is advised that a time - binned description of the sfh be adopted . although their use of the same basis for both generating and fitting simulated spectra is an appropriate test that the algorithm works , it is not a fair assessment of the expected performance of the methods for a database of real galaxy spectra . in  [ models ] we discuss our concerns with their simulation assessments . in  [ basis ] we present a new suite of methods that we test with several sets of simulated galaxy spectra . these simulations , which are described in ",
    "[ simulations ] , are designed to be more representative of a large database of galaxy spectra , such as sdss .      in reality , the population of all observed galaxies is not constrained to be mixtures of a small number of ssps on a discrete grid of age and metallicity .",
    "a more physically accurate representation of galaxies is as mixtures of an infinitely large basis of ssps on a continuous grid of age and metallicity and , depending on the complexity of the underlying physics , a possibly infinite grid of prescriptions for initial mass function and evolutionary track . in our simulations in  [ simulations ] we simulate galaxies from a large database of @xmath36 ssps on a fine grid of age and metallicity to determine whether we can accurately describe their sfhs , metallicities , and kinematic parameters using an appropriately chosen , computationally tractable basis of @xmath35 or 150 spectra .",
    "we adopt a ssp database containing 1278 spectra .",
    "this set of spectra is used to both choose an appropriate basis (  [ basis ] ) and generate simulated spectra (  [ simulations ] ) .",
    "the database is meant to represent the large population of ssps from which observed galaxies can be composed .",
    "we use the spectra from the models of @xcite , computed for a @xcite imf , ` padova 1994 ' evolutionary tracks ( @xcite ) , and stelib library ( @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , we could also vary the imf and evolutionary tracks across spectra and use the same methods developed in ",
    "[ basis ] , but for simplicity decide to fix them in this study .",
    "the ssps in our database are generated on a grid of 213 approximately evenly log - spaced time bins from 0 to 18 gyrs and 6 different metallicities : @xmath37 = 0.0001 , 0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 and 0.05 , where @xmath37 is the fraction of the mass of a star composed of metals ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this grid is designed to approximate a continuous variation across age and @xmath37 .",
    "the coarseness in the current @xmath37 grid is due to limitations in the current stellar population models .",
    "again , a finer grid of age and @xmath37 can be implemented with the techniques that we develop in  [ basis ] .      in previous studies using the starlight code , researchers hand - selected sets of ssp spectra to use in the model fitting . according to @xcite , `` the elements of the base should span the range of spectral properties observed in the sample galaxies and provide enough resolution in age and metallicity to address the desired scientific questions . '' in this same paper , they claim that their basis of @xmath34 ssps adequately recovers parameters of age and metallicity in their simulations . however , as discussed in  [ specsyn ] , these simulations are unrealistic since they employ the same basis to both generate and fit the simulated spectra .    in this section",
    "we present methods to numerically determine a basis @xmath31 of a small number of _ prototype spectra _",
    ", @xmath15 , from a large set of ssp spectra . the resultant basis of prototype spectra will be designed to capture a large proportion of the variation of the set of ssps , which is chosen to span the range of observed spectral properties of a data set of galaxies at a high resolution in age and metallicity , such as the database of 1278 ssps described in  [ models ] .",
    "the numerically chosen basis of prototype spectra , @xmath31 , should recover physical parameters better than any hand - chosen basis of the same size because hand - selected bases ignore subsets of the parameter space and may cause the solution to be degenerate by including multiple ssps with nearly identical spectra . in  [ simulations ]",
    "we show that the bases computed from our numerical methods outperform hand - selected bases used in the literature in parameter estimation for simulated galaxies .",
    "diffusion map is a popular new technique for data parametrization and dimensionality reduction that has been developed by @xcite and @xcite , and was recently used by @xcite to analyse sdss spectra and @xcite to estimate photometric redshifts .",
    "as shown in these latter works , diffusion map has the powerful ability to uncover simple structure in complicated , high - dimensional data .",
    "these analyses demonstrate that this simple structure can be used to make precise statistical inferences about the data .    in the problem at hand , we begin with a set @xmath39 of high - resolution broad - band ssp spectra @xmath40 , where @xmath41 can be very large and each @xmath42 has flux measurements in @xmath43 wavelength bins . from this set ,",
    "our goal is to derive a small basis of @xmath1 prototype spectra , @xmath44 , each of length @xmath45 , that captures most of the variability in @xmath39 . in what follows , we briefly review the basics of the diffusion map technique and then show how it can be used to find an appropriate basis @xmath31 .",
    "the main idea of the diffusion map is that it finds a parametrization of a data set that preserves the connectivity of data points in a way that is dependent only on the relationship of each datum to points in a local neighborhood . by preserving the local interactions in a data set ,",
    "diffusion map is able to learn , e.g. a natural parametrization of the of the spiral in fig . 1 of @xcite where other methods , such as principal components analysis , fail .    starting with our set of ssp spectra , @xmath39 , in units of @xmath46/  per initial @xmath47 , we normalize the spectra at @xmath8 to ensure that we are not confused by absolute scale differences between individual spectra .",
    "we retain the scaling factors @xmath48 for later use to convert back to the original units .",
    "next , we select a discrepancy measure between ssps , i.e. @xmath49 which is the euclidean distance between two ssp spectra .",
    "the specific choice of @xmath50 is often not crucial to the diffusion map ; any reasonable measure of discrepancy will return similar results .",
    "it is important to note here the flexibility of the diffusion map method . for each problem",
    ", we can define a different discrepancy measure based on the type of data available to us and the types of information we want to incorporate .",
    "for example , we could define our measure @xmath51 by weighting more heavily those regions around absorption lines which are highly correlated with stellar age and metallicity .",
    "contrast this flexibility with the rigidity of principal components analysis , which is only based on the correlation structure of the data .    from our discrepancy measure in ( [ distance ] )",
    ", we construct a weighted graph on our data set @xmath39 , where the nodes are the individual ssp spectra and the weights on the edges of the graph reflect the amount of similarity between pairwise spectra .",
    "we define the weights as @xmath52 where @xmath53 should be small enough such that @xmath54 unless @xmath55 and @xmath56 are similar , but large enough so that the entire graph is connected ( i.e. every ssp has at least one non - zero weight to another ssp ) . in practice , we choose @xmath53 that produces a basis that achieves the best fits to galaxy spectra ( see  [ simulations ] ) . by normalizing the rows of the weight matrix , @xmath57 , to sum to unity , we can define a markov random walk on the graph where the probability of going from @xmath55 to @xmath56 in one step is @xmath58 .",
    "we store all of these one - step probabilities in a matrix @xmath59 .    by the theory of markov chains ,",
    "the @xmath60-step transition probabilities are defined by @xmath61 . in the previous analyses in @xcite and @xcite , the authors fixed @xmath60 . in these previous papers ,",
    "the choice of @xmath60 was unimportant because the task was linear regression on the diffusion coordinates , in which the multipliers @xmath62 of the diffusion map were absorbed into the linear regression coefficients @xmath63 . in the present work ,",
    "our task is to determine a set of @xmath1 prototype spectra .",
    "the tool we use is @xmath1-means clustering in diffusion space , where results are dependent upon intra - point euclidean distances of the diffusion map , which in turn are dependent on @xmath60 .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a diffusion operator that considers _ all _ scales @xmath64 simultaneously .",
    "we define the _ multi - scale _ diffusion map as @xmath65.\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the right eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath59 , respectively , in a bi - orthogonal decomposition .",
    "euclidean distance in the @xmath68-dimensional space described by equation ( [ dmap2 ] ) approximates the multi - scale diffusion distance , a distance measure that utilizes the geometry of the data set by simultaneously considering all possible paths between any two data points at all scales @xmath60 , in the markov random walk constructed above .",
    "an advantage to using the multi - scale diffusion map , besides elimination of the tuning parameter @xmath60 , is that it gives a more robust description of the structure of the data by considering the propagation of local interactions of data points through all scales .",
    "we also have three other tuning parameters : @xmath53 , @xmath68 ( dimensionality of the diffusion map ) , and @xmath1 ( number of prototypes ) over which to optimize the fits to galaxy spectra . for simplicity ,",
    "we fix @xmath68 by choosing the dimensionality of the diffusion map to coincide with a 95% drop - off in the eigenvalue multipliers in the multi - scale diffusion map .",
    "this is reasonable because most of the information about the structure of the data will be in the few dimensions with large eigenvalue multipliers .",
    "simulations show that this choice of @xmath68 produces results comparable to optimizing over a large grid of @xmath68 . for the parameter @xmath1 , fits should improve as the basis gets larger .",
    "however , we want to keep @xmath1 small both for computational reasons and to avoid the occurrence of nearly identical spectra in our basis , which can cause degeneracies in our fits . in practice , we choose @xmath1=45 or 150 to directly compare our results with the bases used by @xcite ( cf05 ) and @xcite ( asa07 ) .",
    "this leaves us with only one tuning parameter , @xmath53 , over which to optimize the diffusion @xmath1-means basis in fits to galaxy spectra .",
    "finally , we determine a set of @xmath1 prototype spectra by performing @xmath1-means clustering in the @xmath68-dimensional diffusion map representation ( [ dmap2 ] ) of the ssp spectra , @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath1-means algorithm is a standard machine learning method used to cluster @xmath41 data points into @xmath1 groups .",
    "it works by minimizing the total intra - cluster variance , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the set of points in the @xmath7th cluster and @xmath71 is the @xmath68-dimensional geometric centroid of the set @xmath70 . as described in  3.2 of @xcite , for diffusion maps @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the trivial",
    "left eigenvector of @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath1-means algorithm begins with an initial partition of the data and alternately computes cluster centroids and reallocates points to the cluster with the nearest centroid .",
    "the algorithm stops when no points are allocated differently in two consecutive iterations .",
    "the final centroids define the @xmath1 prototypes to be used in our basis .    in fig .",
    "[ sspdmap ] , we plot the mapping of 1278 ssp spectra into the @xmath74 dimensional diffusion space described by ( [ dmap2 ] ) .",
    "the large black dots denote the @xmath1-means centroids for @xmath35 .",
    "individual ssps are coloured by cluster membership .",
    "the @xmath1 prototypes capture the variability of the ssp spectra along a low - dimensional manifold in diffusion space .",
    "note that the density of prototypes varies along different parts of the manifold .",
    "this is due both to the local complexity of the manifold and the sampling of the original base of ssps .",
    "this latter effect , that we tend to obtain more prototypes in areas where there are more ssps in our basis , can easily be corrected for by using a weighted @xmath1-means method , described in  2.2.3 , that accounts for varying density of ssps along the manifold .",
    "the last step of the diffusion @xmath1-means algorithm is to determine the @xmath1 protospectra and their properties .",
    "first , the normalization constant for the @xmath7th prototype spectrum is @xmath75 and the @xmath7th protospectrum is @xmath76 similarly , the age , metallicity , and `` stellar - mass fraction''the percent of the initial stellar mass still in stars  of prototype @xmath7 are naturally defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are the age , metallicity and stellar - mass fraction of the @xmath80th ssp , respectively .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : protot])-([eqn : protosmf ] ) are natural definitions of the prototype parameters in the sense that the fit of this basis to a galaxy would yield exactly the same parameter estimates as the equivalent mixture of the original set of ssps , @xmath39 .    in fig .",
    "[ protot ] we plot the 45 ssp spectra in cf05 and the 45 prototype spectra found by diffusion @xmath1-means .",
    "all spectra are normalized to 1 at @xmath8=4020   and are coloured by log age .",
    "the diffusion @xmath1-means prototypes spread themselves evenly over the range of spectral profiles , capturing a gradual trend from young to old spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "the cf05 basis includes many similar spectra from younger populations and sparsely covers the range of spectral profiles of older populations .",

    "each of these two methods is similar to diffusion @xmath1-means , but both have critical drawbacks .",
    "_ pc @xmath1-means _ works similarly to diffusion @xmath1-means ( algorithm 1 ) except that @xmath1-means is performed on the projection of the normalized ssp spectra into _ principal components _ ( pc ) space , not diffusion space . for an example of the application of principal components analysis to ssp spectra see @xcite .",
    "the main drawback to pc @xmath1-means is its assumption that the ssp spectra lie on a linear subspace of the original @xmath91 dimensional space .",
    "if the ssps actually lie on a non - linear manifold , then the @xmath1 prototypes may poorly capture the intrinsic variation of the original ssps because the non - linear structure will have been inappropriately collapsed on to a linear space by the principal components projection .",
    "_ standard @xmath1-means _ is also similar to algorithm 1 , except that @xmath1-means is performed in the original @xmath92 dimensional space ; i.e. , no reduction in dimensionality is done before running @xmath1-means .",
    "there are two obvious drawbacks to this procedure .",
    "first , the algorithm generally is slow because distance computations are cumbersome in high dimensions and @xmath1-means usually takes more iterations to converge . for comparison ,",
    "the dimensionality of the spaces used by diffusion and pc @xmath1-means are each @xmath93 , a factor of 100 smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "second , and more importantly , appropriate prototype spectra are difficult to find by standard @xmath1-means because euclidean distances , used by @xmath1-means to define clusters , are only physically meaningful over short distances .",
    "diffusion @xmath1-means avoids this problem by clustering in diffusion space , in which euclidean distance approximates diffusion distance , a measure that has physical meaning on all scales .",
    "the result is that standard @xmath1-means inappropriately relates ssps that are not physically similar .    in fig .",
    "[ prototz ] , we plot @xmath94 versus @xmath95 for @xmath1=150 prototypes in asa07 and diffusion , standard , and pc @xmath1-means .",
    "notably , diffusion @xmath1-means finds a much higher density of prototypes with high @xmath94 or high @xmath95 , reflecting the complicated manner in which ssps with those properties vary with respect to @xmath37 and @xmath60 . at the other extreme ,",
    "the asa07 prototypes reside on a regular grid , and thus include many prototype spectra that are essentially identical and also exclude prototypes that have unique spectral properties .",
    "the standard and pc @xmath1-means prototypes also estimate more high @xmath94 and high @xmath95 prototypes than a regular grid .",
    "the methods introduced above use only the observable properties of ssps to choose representative prototypes",
    ". it may be the case that we want to incorporate other _ a priori _ information that we have about the ssps and their relationship with the galaxies we are fitting .",
    "for instance , we might know that a ssp with a particular age and metallicity is generally found in the types of galaxies we are trying to fit , and hence will want to include in our basis a prototype with characteristics closely matching those of this ssp .",
    "this information can easily be incorporated with the framework introduced above by defining an _ a priori _ weight , @xmath96 for each ssp in our database , where higher weights signify more importance of the ssp .    by modifying the definition of the diffusion map geometric centroid ( [ centroid ] ) to be @xmath97 and altering the @xmath1-means algorithm to minimize @xmath98 instead of @xmath99 in ( [ kmeans ] ) , we choose a basis that reflects both the numerical observable properties of the ssps and our _ a priori _ knowledge .",
    "this weighted @xmath1-means algorithm can be used to correct for the tendency of the prototype ssps to depend on the specific set of ssps , @xmath39 , chosen . if , for example , we define @xmath100 as the inverse of the local density of ssp @xmath80 , then the prototype ssps in fig .",
    "[ sspdmap ] would more uniformly cover the manifold of ssps in diffusion space , and not tend to more heavily sample denser regions of the ssp manifold . in this manner ,",
    "the prototype spectra will only depend on the spectral properties , and not the particular sampling of the set of ssps .",
    "we use simulations to assess the performance of the diffusion @xmath1-means method for selection of a basis of prototype ssp spectra compared to bases derived by other @xmath1-means methods and the bases of @xmath35 used by cf05 and @xmath101 used by asa07 .",
    "we analyse the performance of these methods on physically - motivated simulated spectra from two different prescriptions .",

    "a common difficulty in population synthesis studies is the so - called age - metallicity degeneracy , where young , metal - rich ssps are confused with old , metal - poor ssps . using a regular grid of ssp prototypes in population synthesis can exacerbate this problem because several ssps with nearly identical spectra ( but different ages and metallicities ) will likely be included , inducing degeneracy in the spectral model ( [ cfmodel ] ) , and causing the estimated sfh parameters for each galaxy to be highly variable . a diffusion @xmath1-means basis , on the other hand , picks ssp prototypes whose spectra more evenly span the range of spectral characteristics , minimizing the inclusion of very similar spectra and thus decreasing the degeneracy effects in the minimization of ( [ chisq ] ) . in fig .",

    "secondly , the slopes of the estimated trends produced by the diffusion map bases ( 0.146 for @xmath1=45 and 0.180 for @xmath1=150 ) are considerably smaller than the slope of the trend in the asa07 estimates ( 0.250 ) .",
    "these estimates have implications for the physical models that govern galaxy evolution .",
    "finally , the @xmath1=45 diffusion map basis estimates no young , metal - poor galaxies , showing a sharp decline from densely - populated regions of the parameter space to vacant regions .",

    "<S> to further our knowledge of the complex physical process of galaxy formation , it is essential that we characterize the formation and evolution of large databases of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral synthesis starlight code of cid fernandes et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2004 ) was designed for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> results of starlight are highly dependent on the choice of input basis of simple stellar population ( ssp ) spectra . </S>",
    "<S> speed of the code , which uses random walks through the parameter space , scales as the square of the number of basis spectra , making it computationally necessary to choose a small number of ssps that are coarsely sampled in age and metallicity . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we develop methods based on diffusion map ( lafon & lee , 2006 ) that , for the first time , choose appropriate bases of prototype ssp spectra from a large set of ssp spectra designed to approximate the continuous grid of age and metallicity of ssps of which galaxies are truly composed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our techniques achieve better accuracy of physical parameter estimation for simulated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that our methods significantly decrease the age - metallicity degeneracy that is common in galaxy population synthesis methods . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze a sample of 3046 galaxies in sdss dr6 and compare the parameter estimates obtained from different basis choices .    </S>",
