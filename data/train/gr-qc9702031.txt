    "this paper concerns an aspect of the long - standing question : how to create a time machine ( or why is it impossible ) ?",
    "we begin with the following    [ [ definition . ] ] definition .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + +    let @xmath0 be an inextendible acausal spacetime .",
    "we call @xmath1 a _ time machine _ ( created in the universe @xmath2 ) if    1 .",
    "@xmath3 comprises the causality violating set @xmath4 : @xmath5 2 .",
    "@xmath6 is isometric to @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is some inextendible causal spacetime and @xmath8 is compact .",
    "it is meant here that depending on whether we decide to make a time machine or not the world and our laborotory must be described by @xmath0 and @xmath3 , or by @xmath2 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we require the compactness of @xmath9 to differentiate tms , which supposedly can be built by some advanced civilization , and causality violations of a cosmological nature such as the gdel universe or the gott ",
    "time machine \" @xcite .",
    "a few important facts are known about time machines . among them :    1 .",
    "time machines with compact @xmath4 ( _ compactly generated tms , ctms _ ) evolving from a noncompact partial cauchy surface must violate wec [ haw ] @xcite , 2 .",
    "creation [ tip ] of a ctm leads to singularity formation unless some energy condition ( slightly stronger than wec ) is violated @xcite .    though strictly speaking these facts do not _",
    "prove _ that ctms are impossible altogether , they , at least , can be used as starting point for the search for a mechanism protecting causality from ctms @xcite .",
    "ctms , however , only constitute a specific class of tms .",
    "noncompactly generated tms ( ntms ) seem to be every bit as interesting as ctms .",
    "sometimes ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) they are barred from consideration on the basis that some unpredictible information could enter noncompact @xmath4 from a singularity or from infinity .",
    "this is so indeed , but compactness does not eliminate this trouble ( in fact , compactness does not even eliminate singularities as a possible source of unpredictible information , as in the misner space ) . the creation of a time machine is inherently connected with a loss of predictability ( cf .",
    "one inevitably risks meeting something unexpected ( i.  e.  not fixed by the data on the initial surface ) as soon as one intersects a cauchy horizon ( by the very definition of the horizon ) .",
    "so , ctms and ntms are not too different in _ this _ regard .",
    "it therefore seems important to find out whether there are any similar obstacles to creating ntms .",
    "the example of the deutsch - politzer tm @xcite showed that item [ haw ] is not true in the case of ntms .",
    "this tm , however , possesses singularities ( and though mild , they are of such a nature that one can not  smooth \" them out @xcite ) .",
    "thus the following questions remained unanswered :    1 .",
    "do time machines without singularities exist ? 2 .",
    "are the weak energy condition and the absence of singularities mutually exclusive for ( noncompactly generated ) time machines ?",
    "our aim in this paper is to give the answers to both these questions ( positive to the first and negative to the second ) .",
    "we make no attempt to discuss possible consequences of these answers . in particular , being interested only in the very existence of the desired tm we consider the fact that it may be created ( see the definition ) in the spacetime resembling the friedmann universe , only as a pleasant surprise .",
    "to construct a singularity - free tm it would be natural to start from the deutsch - politzer tm and to look for an appropriate conformal transformation of its metric which would move the dangerous points to infinity .",
    "however , it is not easy in the four - dimensional case to find a transformation ( if it exists ) yielding both wec fulfilment and @xmath10- ( or ba- ) completeness .",
    "so , we shall use somewhat different means @xcite .",
    "first , by a conformal transformation we make a part of the _ two - dimensional _ deutsch - politzer spacetime locally complete ( the spacetime @xmath11 below ) , then compose @xmath3 obeying wec from @xmath11 and some @xmath12 ( chosen so that it does not spoil the completeness ) , and finally embed the resulting tm in an appropriate @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a square @xmath14 @xmath15 endowed with the following metric : @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a smooth bounded function defined on @xmath18 such that @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the four points @xmath21 bound two segments @xmath22 and we require that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is some neighborhood of @xmath25 .",
    "now ( as is done with the minkowski plane in the case of the `` usual '' deutsch - politzer spacetime @xcite ) remove the points @xmath21 from @xmath14 , make cuts along @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and glue the upper bank of each cut with the lower bank of the other ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "curved deutsch - politzer time machine .",
    "the shaded region is the causality violating set .",
    "the dashed line bounds @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting spacetime @xmath11 (  curved deutsch - politzer tm \" ) is not , of course , diffeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , for simplicity of notation we shall continue to use the `` old coordinates '' @xmath28 for its points .",
    "let @xmath12 be a two - sphere with the standard metric : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant satisfying ( to bring about wec fulfillment , see below ) @xmath31 then @xmath32 is just the desired time machine .      to find an appropriate @xmath0 require in addition to ( [ f1],[f2],[wec ] ) @xmath34 and denote by @xmath35 the spacetime obtained by replacing @xmath36 in the definition of @xmath11 .",
    "it follows from what is proven in the next section that the spacetime @xmath37 is inextendible and could thus be taken as @xmath0 ( with , for example , @xmath38 ) .",
    "we would like , however , to construct another , more `` realistic '' @xmath0 .",
    "consider a manifold @xmath39 with the metric @xmath40      \\label{fr}\\ ] ] here @xmath41 is a coordinate on @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) are polar coordinates on s@xmath44 .",
    "impose the following conditions on @xmath45 ( it suffices to choose @xmath46 for their feasibility ) :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 are _ convex _ positive functions and for some @xmath49 holds @xmath50 .",
    "it is easy to see that the region @xmath51 of this manifold is @xmath52 .",
    "`` almost friedmann '' time machine .",
    "shaded regions are parts of the friedmann universe .",
    "the thick horizontal lines depict cosmological singularities .",
    "so we can repeat the manipulations with cuts and obtain a tm with the metric ( [ fr ] ) on @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , that is the tm is created in a spacetime with the metric of the friedmann universe outside some spherical layer and some time interval .",
    "the metric of the time machine @xmath54 due to ( [ qn ] ) is given by ( [ gq],[sp ] ) and the condition ( [ wec ] ) guarantees that the weak ( and even the dominant ) energy conditions hold there ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in the outer space @xmath55 the metric is given by ( [ fr ] ) .",
    "introducing the quantities @xmath56 we bring it to the form ( 14.49 ) of ref .",
    "the fact that by ( [ a1 ] ) @xmath57 and @xmath58 are positive and convex gives us : @xmath59 ( in the last inequality we have also used that @xmath60 . )",
    "hence ( see @xcite for notation ) @xmath61 so ( see ( 14.52 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , wec holds in this region too .",
    "the results of @xcite prove that there are no `` ba - singularities '' in @xmath3 , that is any timelike inextendible ( in @xmath0 ) curve @xmath62 with bounded acceleration has infinite proper length .",
    "there is a popular idea , however , that only @xmath10-complete regions may be accepted as singularity - free .",
    "so , the remainder of the article is devoted to the proof of the fact that @xmath3 ( not the whole @xmath0 , where cosmological singularities @xmath63 present ) has no `` @xmath10-singularities . ''",
    "we shall use the following new notation : @xmath64 let @xmath65 be a @xmath66 curve in @xmath3 .",
    "it defines two other curves ( its projections onto @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) : @xmath67lying in @xmath3 and @xmath11 the curves @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be considered at the same time as lying in @xmath0 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "we shall call such curves inextendible if they are inextendible in those  larger \" spacetimes . let \\{**e**@xmath70 } be an orthonormal basis in the point @xmath71 , obtained from \\{**e**@xmath72 } by parallel propagating along @xmath68 and * * e**@xmath73 . choosing * * e**@xmath74 and solving the equations",
    "@xmath75 one immediately finds @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the `` affine length '' @xmath79 of @xmath68 is by definition @xcite @xmath80\\equiv\\int_0 ^ 1\\bigl(\\sum_i      \\langle\\dot\\gamma,\\textbf e_{(i)}\\rangle^2\\bigr)^{1/2}ds      \\label{mu}\\ ] ] we define affine lengths @xmath81 $ ] and @xmath82 $ ] by changing @xmath83 in ( [ mu ] ) to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . due to",
    "( [ ind ] ) these definitions are consistent .",
    "obviously , @xmath80\\geqslant1/2\\,(\\mu_q[\\gamma_q]+\\mu_s[\\gamma_s ] )      \\label{otz}\\ ] ]    * proposition . *",
    "if @xmath62 is inextendible then @xmath86=\\infty$ ] .",
    "if @xmath68 is inextendible , than either @xmath87 or @xmath69 ( or both ) are inextendible , too .",
    "but @xmath12 is obviously @xmath10-complete .",
    "so the proposition follows from ( [ otz ] ) coupled with the following    * lemma . *",
    "if @xmath69 is inextendible , then @xmath81=\\infty$ ] .",
    "let us introduce a function @xmath88 on @xmath69 : @xmath89 and let us split @xmath69 on segments @xmath90 so that the sign of @xmath88 does not change on @xmath91 : @xmath92 denote the contribution of a segment @xmath91 in @xmath81 $ ] by @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath94 we can write for @xmath93 ( cf .",
    "( [ ek ] ) ) : @xmath95 here and subsequently we denote by @xmath96 some irrelevant positive constants factored out from the integrand . using @xmath97^{-2}=\\bigl[f(0)\\bigr]^{-2}\\exp\\{-2\\int_0^s      ( \\phi,_\\alpha\\dot\\alpha + \\phi,_\\beta\\dot\\beta)\\,ds'\\ }      \\label{tozh}\\ ] ] we can rewrite ( [ otz2 ] ) as @xmath98 for definiteness let @xmath99 on @xmath91 .",
    "then the first exponent in ( [ otz3 ] ) is greater than the second and we can replace it by their geometric mean , that is [ see ( [ tozh ] ) ] by @xmath100 .",
    "so , @xmath101 ( the third inequality follows again from @xmath99 . ) clearly , ( [ otzf ] ) also holds for those @xmath91 where @xmath102 and hence summing over @xmath103 gives : @xmath104\\geqslant c_5\\bigl(\\phi(0)-\\phi(s)\\bigr ) ,      \\quad\\forall s\\in[0,1 )      \\label{poln}\\ ] ] there are no closed null geodesics in @xmath35 .",
    "so , it is  locally complete \" @xcite .",
    "that is any inextendible @xmath69 either has @xmath81 = \\infty$ ] , or leaves any compact subset of @xmath35 .",
    "but in the latter case ( recall that @xmath105 ) @xmath106 is unbounded below , which due to ( [ poln ] ) again gives @xmath107=\\infty.\\ ] ] @xmath108",
