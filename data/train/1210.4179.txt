    "the inflationary paradigm provides convincing solutions to the basic problems of standard big bang cosmology .",
    "moreover , it offers a testable mechanism for the generation of primordial cosmological perturbations that seed the formation of large scale structures and are imprinted on the cosmological microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "so far , the simplest models of inflation are in agreement with observations ; they are based on a single scalar field , the inflaton , which slowly rolls down a flat potential for a period sufficiently long to achieve sixty @xmath0-folds of inflation .",
    "while at first sight it seems easy to build inflationary scenarios with the desired properties ( and indeed there are plenty of proposals ) , a theoretical challenge is to embed consistent models of inflation in a fundamental theory , capable to combine cosmological inflation with particle physics models at short distances .",
    "an option is to embed inflation in string theory , using as inflaton candidate one of the many light moduli available in string set - ups .",
    "see @xcite for recent nice reviews that also refer to the relevant literature .    much work has been done in particular for embedding models of inflation into warped flux compactifications of type iib string theory .",
    "this approach is referred to as _ warped d - brane inflation _",
    "@xcite , in which inflation is realized by the motion of a probe d3-brane along the radial direction of a _ strongly - warped throat _ region inside a flux compactification . in this type of geometries , fluxes @xcite and non - perturbative effects , such as gaugino condensation on wrapped d7-branes @xcite , are turned on to stabilize light moduli that do not drive inflation .",
    "this approach has been refined significantly over past years , using the deep understanding of warped conifold geometries recently acquired , motivated by the ads / cft correspondence .    in this work ,",
    "we continue to build along this line of research , embedding a slow - roll model of inflation in a warped throat geometry with various background fields and fluxes turned on",
    ". we will focus on a warped throat dual to a gauge theory that exhibits ` walking behavior ' @xcite , which has a coupling constant characterized by an rg flow that runs slowly within a range of energy scales . from a geometrical point of view",
    ", this energy range corresponds to a region of transition between a geometry sourced by a stack of d5-branes in the deep infrared ( ir ) , and a space - time that approximates the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) throat @xcite in the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "this region is controlled by fluxes that acquire non - trivial profiles which are tunable to a certain extent .",
    "the rich content of background fields turned on in the geometry , which is necessary to generate multiple scale dynamics in the qft dual , offers an attractive arena for embedding models of warped d - brane inflation .",
    "this is the scope of this work , in which we show that a successful inflationary model can be embedded in this geometry using a probe d3-brane .",
    "fluxes and warping generate a force which acts on the probe d3-brane , thereby inducing inflation with no need to include additional sources such as anti - d3-branes : in this sense , our scenario can be seen as a generalization of the inflationary model built on the baryonic branch of the klebanov - strassler throat @xcite . in our set - up",
    ", slow - roll inflation naturally occurs precisely in the region in which the walking dynamics is manifest in the dual field theory ; hence the name _ slow - walking inflation_. remarkably , in the regime we are focussing on , we find a fully analytical form for the probe brane potential , which enables us to clearly appreciate the roles of the geometrical parameters that govern this potential . from the perspective of the dual field theory , it is possible to identify which operators are responsible for generating the main features of the potential , leading to a qft interpretation of some aspects of our scenario .",
    "in particular , the vevs of two operators in the qft dual start to dominate in the walking regime , and combine in such a way to generate the flat potential for the d3-brane .",
    "the large number of parameters characterizing the geometry provide enough freedom to tune the d - brane potential , allowing to comfortably accommodate the requirements of producing sixty @xmath0-folds of slow - roll inflation , and to match the observed amplitude and scale - dependence for the power spectrum of scalar fluctuations .",
    "interestingly , inflation occurs naturally around an _ inflection point _ of the brane potential , which can be related to the non - trivial profile of the dilaton along the radial direction . within our scenario ,",
    "we obtain robust predictions for the properties of the inflationary process : the slow - roll @xmath1-parameter is much smaller than the @xmath2-parameter ; the @xmath2-parameter is negative , and its absolute value is proportional to the inverse of the number of @xmath0-folds .",
    "the resulting value for the scalar spectral index is in good agreement with observations by wmap @xcite .    building a model of inflation in the warped throat geometry , as we achieve here ,",
    "is only the first step in the theoretical investigation of our scenario .",
    "next , it needs to be checked whether inflation survives after including corrections to the d - brane potential due to couplings between the d3-brane , the moduli stabilizing sectors and gravitational degrees of freedom as well as kaluza - klein modes .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath2-problem : typically , corrections to the d3-brane potential due to the aforementioned effects tend to make the @xmath2-parameter large , and spoil inflation .",
    "originally , this problem was pointed out in @xcite when attempting to embed inflation in supergravity .",
    "it has been widely analyzed in recent years in the context of warped d - brane inflation @xcite , when embedding a d3-brane in the ads - like region of a klebanov - strassler throat .",
    "our set - up is different from the ks warped throat d - brane scenario .",
    "thus , a careful analysis of the @xmath2-problem in the present context is not straightforward so we will not pursue it here .",
    "let us however point out that the large number of parameters involved and the various operators that can be switched on from the qft perspective , leave the hope that dangerous contributions from compactification effects can be tuned away without qualitatively changing the features of our set - up .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "in section  [ sec - walkinggeometry ] , we carefully describe the geometry that constitutes the arena for our inflationary model , with emphasis on the parameters describing the warped throat ( see in particular section  [ sec - physcharactgeometry ] ) . in section  [ sec - reviewd3inflation ] , we briefly review d3-brane inflation in a generic geometry of the above form . in section  [ sec - slowwalkinginflation ] , these results are then applied for the background of section  [ sec - walkinggeometry ] .",
    "we find ( for a particular range of parameters ) analytic expressions for the quantities for inflation ( @xmath3 and the amplitude of the power spectrum ) , showing that they exhibit a scaling behavior with the parameters of the model .",
    "an explicit inflationary trajectory is also presented .",
    "finally , section  [ sec - discussion ] summarizes our results and concludes pointing to future possible studies .",
    "various appendices of technical nature are included .",
    "we note that other models of inflation based on embedding probe branes within gauge / gravity duality have recently been discussed in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss the warped throat geometry of interest , emphasizing its geometrical and physical aspects that we will use later for building our model of inflation .",
    "the same class of geometries were considered in @xcite , where they were instead used for building particle physics models of walking technicolor .      in this section",
    ", we will consider type iib string theory in the supergravity limit .",
    "the topology of the background space time will contain a four dimensional minkowski space and a six - dimensional calabi - yau ( cy ) ` internal ' space related to the conifold . due to this",
    ", the background space - time will preserve minimal ( @xmath4 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "let us start then , by considering type iib supergravity and the geometry produced by stacking on top of each other @xmath5 d5-branes wrapping an @xmath6 inside a 6d calabi - yau ( cy ) cone @xcite  the conifold with topology @xmath7 .",
    "we truncate type iib supergravity to include only the metric , the dilaton @xmath8 and the rr three - form @xmath9 , which we express in terms of the ( @xmath10 left - invariant ) one - forms @xmath11 , ( @xmath12 )  see appendix  [ app - backgrounddetails ] for more details .",
    "we then propose an ansatz that assumes the functions appearing in the background to depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "setting @xmath14 , we write the background metric in einstein frame as [ eq - wrappedd5metric ]    ds_e^2 = & e^()/2 .    as mentioned above ,",
    "there are also a dilaton @xmath8 and a rr - three form @xmath15 that complete the background .",
    "we write details of the full configuration in appendix  [ app - backgrounddetails ] , which as we commented , will preserve minimal susy .",
    "any particular susy solution is determined by solving the system of bps equations .",
    "these equations are in general non - linear and coupled .",
    "they can be rearranged in a convenient form by rewriting the functions appearing in eq .   in terms of a new set of functions ( a ` basis ' that we call @xmath16 defined in eq .   in appendix  [ app - backgrounddetails ] ) , to make the system still non - linear but at least decoupled .    after some lengthy algebra ( described in detail in @xcite and summarized in appendix  [ app - backgrounddetails ] ) , we find that the relevant functions for the purposes of this paper are given by [ eq - newfunctions2 ] q ( ) = n_c ( 2 ( 2 ) -1 ) , 2 e^2k = p , e^4 = , with @xmath17 an integration constant and the function @xmath18 satisfying the second order differential equation [ eq - masterequation ] p  + p ( + - 4 ( 2 ) ) = 0",
    ". we will refer to eq .   as the _ master equation_.",
    "this is the _ only _ equation that needs solving in order to generate the large classes of supersymmetric background solutions we are interested in .",
    "the equation for @xmath19 depends on the function @xmath20 defined in eq .  ,",
    "proportional to the number @xmath5 of wrapped branes .",
    "we now take the configuration of eq .   and apply to it a solution generating technique .",
    "this will produce a more interesting background in view of our applications ( more on this in subsection  [ sec - physcharactgeometry ] ) .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed a u - duality that takes a background of the form written in eq .   with certain particular solutions of eq .",
    "and maps them into another background where new fluxes are turned on .",
    "see also @xcite for a different perspective on this technique .",
    "the effect of this solution - generating technique ( which we will refer to as _ ` rotation ' _ ) can be summarized by defining a basis of 1-forms , which in einstein frame reads [ eq - vielbein ]    e^xi & = ^-e^dx_i , e^ = k_1 ^ 12 ^e^ + kd , e^3 = k_1 ^ 12 ^ ( _ 3+d ) , + e^ & = k_1 ^ 12 ^e^ + q d , e^ = k_1 ^ 12 ^e^ + qd , + e^1 & = k_1 ^ 12 ^(_1+a d ) , e^2 = k_1 ^ 12 ^(_2 -ad ) ,    where @xmath21 are the four minkowski directions ( and the @xmath22 are defined in eq .  ) .",
    "we define the warp factor @xmath23 appearing in the previous expression as [ eq - rotatedwarpfactor ] k_1 ^ -2 ( 1 - k_2 ^ 2 e^2 ) , which depends on two constants , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these will be determined later on by appropriate physical requirements .",
    "the new configuration contains a metric @xmath26 , a dilaton @xmath8 , a rr three - form @xmath9 and a five - form @xmath27 together with a ns three - form @xmath28 and its associated potential @xmath29 .",

    "the main message up to this point is the followig .",
    "we start with a configuration of d5-branes preserving minimal susy .",
    "this set - up is characterized by the solutions to what we called the master equation , eq .  .",
    "some solutions to this equation can be used to generate other backgrounds like the ones in eq .    with full details given in appendix  [ app - backgrounddetails ] .",
    "regardless of the background being that in eq .   or that in eq .",
    ", there is _ one _ master - equation controlling them .",
    "once we have solved for @xmath18 , we can study the dynamics of probe d3-branes embedded in the backgrounds of eqs .   or ",
    "passing from one to the other is just a matter of appropriately choosing the constants @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , we will find useful to present a classification of the solutions to eq .   in the next section .",
    "we now characterize the properties of the solutions of eq .  .",
    "most of the results of this section were already discussed in @xcite , hence we will be sketchy .    since the master equation is a second order differential equation , the general solution to eq .",
    "will have two integration constants . in a regime in which @xmath31 ( we will discuss its physical meaning below ) ,",
    "the master equation is approximately solved by [ eq - seedsolution ] = c ^1/3 , which depends on the two integration constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 . by inspecting the previous expression ,",
    "one notices that it is possible to determine a scale @xmath34 such that the solution for @xmath19 is approximately constant for @xmath35 , while for @xmath36 behaves as @xmath37 .",

    ", we briefly review the most relevant properties for our purposes , referring the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "if the integration constant @xmath34 is sufficiently large and positive , there is an intermediate regime in the radial direction , from @xmath104 to @xmath53 , in which the effective 4d gauge coupling of the dual field theory is finite and approximately constant @xcite .",
    "hence , the geometry associated with solutions with large @xmath34 are suitable for describing field theories exhibiting _ walking _ dynamics . in the qft",
    "dual , the vevs of two operators start to dominate in the regime @xmath105 , which are absent in the ks configuration : a dimension-2 vev that brings the background on the baryonic branch @xcite , and a dimension-6 vev associated with the walking dynamics .",
    "the combined action of the two operators , enriches the dynamics generating the intermediate walking region and provides yet another physical scale , at the value @xmath106 in the radial coordinate @xmath107 , corresponding approximately to the scale where the walking regime ends and the system enters into a confining regime . at the geometrical level , the position @xmath108 roughly corresponds to the value of the radial coordinate below which the functions @xmath109 , @xmath110 ( controlling @xmath111 ) defined in appendix  [ app - backgrounddetails ] become non - trivial  this fact is associated with the spontaneous breaking of a discrete @xmath112 global symmetry and with a confining behaviour  see the second paper of @xcite . as we will see in what follows ,",
    "the region @xmath113 is important for building our inflationary set - up .    in order to consider inflationary models , we need to glue our throat geometry to a compact space ,",
    "say a ( warped ) cy - three - fold , in the uv .",
    "to this extent , let us discuss the uv behavior of @xmath52 , which is controlled by the constant @xmath114 .",
    "for generic values of the parameter @xmath25 , the warp factor @xmath52 asymptotes to a constant as the radial coordinate @xmath13 grows . in the field theory",
    "dual , this is associated with the presence of a dimension-8 operator that dominates the dynamics in the uv and needs a careful specification of a uv completion  see the discussion in @xcite . in this uv region , the geometry generically differs considerably from a space - time dual to a conformal theory .",
    "thus , it makes little sense to interpret the duals of the integration constants of the geometry as operators representing ` small perturbations ' around a conformal fixed point .",
    "fortunately , the uv behavior can be improved : tuning the parameter @xmath25 appearing in the warp factor @xmath23 , cf .",
    "eq .  , to be @xmath115 adiabatically switches off the aforementioned dimension-8 operator , and the geometry becomes ( logarithmically ) close to ads for large values of the radial coordinate @xcite , thanks to rr five - form and ns three - form fluxes that get turned on at @xmath116  see the plots in @xcite .",
    "the configuration at @xmath117 becomes _ almost _ identical to the klebanov - strassler background @xcite .",
    "so by making this choice for @xmath25 , we can reliably identify the operators in the dual field theory representing ` small perturbations ' from a quasi - conformal regime .",
    "this is good news also for the aim to build an inflationary model . after tuning @xmath25",
    "as explained above , in the uv , the throat is very similar to ads space , which implies that upon gluing the throat into a compact space the ( four - dimensional ) graviton zero mode will be mostly localized in the compact part of the bulk and not in the warped throat .",

    ".   runs over flavor indices , then for @xmath234 ( one probe d3-brane ) , the baryon operators have one free flavor index . * for simplicity , we assume that the khler potential is trivial .",
    "this implies that up to numerical factors , the potential reads [ eq - vappendix ] v~ ( ) ^2 + ( ) ^2 + ( ) ^2 .",
    "* we will also consider that the difference between the vevs of the baryon and anti - baryon fields is related to the vev of the operator @xmath235 , defined in @xcite , ~ ( - ) .",

    "the relation between @xmath235 and this particular combination of gravity fields above is strengthened by the fact that when analysing the asymptotics of the field @xmath238 above , it is found that it describes a dimension-2 operator getting a vev @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath238 , an invariant under the rotation procedure , is drawn in fig .  3 of @xcite .",

    "hence , we propose that we have ` background ' baryonic fields taking a large vev , while the mesonic superfield probes this qft , varying slowly .",
    "the result of this very qualitative reasoning tells us that the force on the d3 probe has a similar shape as that of the ` geometry ' invariant given by the combination in eq .  .",
    "in terms of the radial coordinate , this is a function which has a maximum close to an intermediate point  that turns out to be @xmath34  and then decays in the ir and in the far uv .",
    "notice that the qft dual to our geometry has , as discussed in @xcite , two _",
    "independent scales_. one of the scales controlled by @xmath34 indicates , when flowing from the uv to the ir , the beginning of the walking region .",
    "flowing further towards the ir , the second scale is given by @xmath243 .",
    "this scale indicates the end of the walking region , the onset of confinement and @xmath244 symmetry breaking .",
    "these two scales , not surprisingly control our inflationary dynamics .    note that we obtain a qualitatively very similar result for the @xmath1 slow - rolling parameter in eq .  .",
    "this is due to the fact that roughly @xmath245 , for an almost constant @xmath141 . in this sense",
    ", there should be some connection between the qft potential and the potential felt by the d3 probe .",
    "note that the point in the radial direction where the force is strongest corresponds to the transition between the qft being dominated by its uv behaviour to it being dominated by its ir behaviour .",
    "this transition point dominates the behaviour of our model of inflation .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to explore how good the approximation of a travelling _ probe _",
    "d3-brane , actually is .",
    "the outcome of the study is that , for slowly moving d3 branes , the backreaction effects are important only close to the far ir region @xmath246 . in other words , we will give a quantitative way of calculating the backreaction of the d3-brane on the geometry , in a particular situation  this will be in concordance with the approximations we used in our model of inflation .    to make this calculation feasible , we assume for simplicity to be in a ks - background ( since we are taking very large values of @xmath93 this is not a very drastic assumption ) and add d3 sources .",
    "we will also assume that the d3-brane moves quite slowly .",
    "that is , its kinetic energy is negligible when calculating the deformation of the space time that is mostly sourced by its mass .",
    "the main simplification is to consider the backreaction assuming the d3 to be smeared on the directions @xmath247 .",
    "if we focus on this particular and simplified problem , we can write an _ exact _ solution . the solution is actually written in eqs .",
    "( 3.8 ) and ( 3.9 ) of @xcite .",
    "there , it was found that the warp factor @xmath23 becomes = _ ks + _ ^ , _",
    "ks= _ ^dx , where @xmath248 is the probe d3 distribution .",
    "we should take @xmath249 or some other function localized close to the position of the probe d3 , @xmath250 , say like a gaussian or similar .",
    "the point @xmath250 ( which should not be confused with the position of the inflection point introduced in section  [ sec - scalingbehaviour ] ) _ slowly _ changes as the brane moves towards the end of the geometry .",
    "suppose that we want to estimate the backreaction for large values of the radial coordinate .",
    "in this case the warp factor will change as - _ ks ~ [ eq - backreactedwarpfactoruv ] where we approximated the profile of branes by a delta function localized at @xmath250 .",
    "thus , the correction is very small .",
    "however , for the case in which the brane is close to @xmath246 , we have that the new contribution to the warp factor goes like - _ ks ~ [ eq - backreactedwarpfactorir ] for small @xmath250 .",
    "hence the correction is large .",
    "now , to the point : for values where inflation occurs , we are able to use the approximation above and see explicitly that the d3 probe should actually not change things too much .",
    "after the end of inflation , we come close to @xmath97 and the set - up and the solution should change due to the backreaction .",
    "there is a field theoretical way of stating the argument above : if the meson field is ` slowly varying ' , that is the d3 is slowly rolling , we can integrate out the meson in the super potential of eq .   and we would then get the super potential that one typically has in a quiver of the form in eq .  , giving the usual baryonic branch as one of its vacua . the gravity solution is not much different to the ( baryonic branch of the ) klebanov - strassler background , this is expressed by eq .  . as the meson vev becomes comparable to the other scales in the problem ,",
    "the meson field becomes more influential and we should instead describe the susy dynamics of the quiver in eq .  .",
    "this coincides with the d3-brane going to the far ir of the geometry and changing it considerably  this is expressed by eq .  .",
