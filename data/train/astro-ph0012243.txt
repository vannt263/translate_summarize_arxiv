    "the existence of a galactic population of gamma - ray sources is a well - known fact since the early days of the cos - b experiment ( bignami & hermsen 1983 ) . the esa cos - b satellite was launched on august 9 , 1975 , and was operational until april 25 , 1982 .",
    "the second cos - b catalog contains 25 sources , most of which are located very close to the galactic plane ( swanenburg et al .",
    "although two low - latitude sources were soon identified with pulsars ( crab and vela ) , the nature of the remaining , presumably galactic sources , stood uncertain .",
    "montmerle ( 1979 ) presented the first correlation study for these high - energy sources .",
    "he found that about 50 % of the unidentified cos - b detections lie in regions containing young objects like massive stars and supernova remnants .",
    "he estimated that the chance probability of these associations was as low as @xmath1 and suggested that the gamma - rays could be the result of @xmath2-decays originated in hadronic interactions between locally accelerated cosmic rays and ambient gas .",
    "the cosmic rays would be produced by a two - step process : low - energy protons or nuclei are firstly accelerated by ob stars and injected at supernova shock fronts where they are subsequently re - accelerated up to high - energies by fermi mechanism .",
    "this scenario predicted by first time the positional correlation between low - latitude gamma - ray sources and star forming regions , a correlation that would be tested by several authors , using increasingly improved data , in the years to come .",
    "a major breakthrough in the study of galactic gamma - ray sources was achieved with the advent of nasa s compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) in 1991 . during its lifetime ,",
    "the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) detected 271 point sources , 170 of which have not been clearly identified yet ( hartman et al .",
    "about a half of these unidentified sources are located at low galactic latitudes and many studies looking for correlations with known galactic populations have been performed in recent years .",
    "for instance , sturner & dermer ( 1995 ) and sturner et al . (",
    "1996 ) have investigated the correlation between gamma - ray sources in the first two egret catalogs ( thompson et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) and supernova remnants , finding statistical support for the idea that some remnants could be gamma - ray emitters .",
    "this idea is also supported by several particular cases studied in detail by esposito et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and combi et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 , 2001 ) , where the gamma - ray emission seems to come from molecular clouds overtaken by the expanding shell of nearby remnants .",
    "the correlation between egret sources and star forming regions was confirmed by kaaret & cottam ( 1996 ) and yadigaroglu & romani ( 1997 ) , using data from the second egret catalog .",
    "contrary to the original hypothesis of montmerle , these authors suggested that most of the low - latitude sources could be pulsars .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the discovery of several new gamma - ray pulsars since the cos - b original identifications ( there are at least seven pulsars detected so far , see thompson 1996 ) as well as by population studies ( e.g. yadigaroglu & romani 1995 , zhang et al .",
    "2000 , mclaughlin & cordes 2000 ) .",
    "the high level of variability and peculiar spectral features presented by some low - latitude unidentified sources , however , is quite at odds with the hypothesis of a unique population of galactic gamma - ray emitters and seem to open the possibility that our galaxy could contain yet unknown types of high - energy sources ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "1996 , merck et al .",
    "1996 , tavani et al .",
    "1998 , tompkins 1999 , romero et al .",
    "2000 , punsly et al .",
    "2000 , torres et al . 2000 ) .    in this paper we shall review the main correlational properties of the sample of low - latitude unidentified gamma - ray sources in the third and final egret catalog .",
    "we shall discuss which objects in our galaxy are expected to generate strong enough gamma - ray emission as to have been detected by egret and what are the prospects for future space missions like integral and glast regarding the identification of galactic gamma - ray sources .",
    "there are 81 unidentified gamma - ray sources in the third egret catalog located at less than @xmath3 from the galactic plane .",
    "six of these sources are thought to be artifacts associated with the proximity of the very bright vela pulsar .",
    "these sources do not show up in a map which excludes the vela pulsation intervals and will not be taken into account in the present discussion .",
    "we have , consequently , a sample of 75 unidentified low - latitude sources , whose distribution with galactic latitude is shown in figure 1 .",
    "a strong concentration around zero degrees can be clearly seen in this histogram , indicating that most of the sources belong to our galaxy .",
    "one of the first things that we could ask about the group of low - latitude gamma - ray sources is whether they are correlated with the spiral arms of the galaxy .",
    "the arms are where most stars are formed and the regions where the galactic gas storage is concentrated . in order to test the correlation",
    ", we need a tracer for the spiral structure of the galaxy .",
    "the usual tracers , in this sense , are giant and bright hii regions .",
    "we can use , then , georgelin & georgelin s ( 1976 ) catalog of the 100 brightest hii regions to perform a correlation analysis with the sample of low - latitude sources in the third egret catalog .",
    "when this is done , we find that 32 out of 75 sources are positionally overlapping hii regions .",
    "in order to quantify the statistical significance of this number we can make numerical simulations of random populations of galactic gamma - ray sources ( subject to adequate boundary conditions ) using the code developed by romero et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to produce synthetic gamma - ray source populations . through thousands of simulations , we find that the expected number of chance coincidences is @xmath4 .",
    "this implies a poisson probability of chance correlation of @xmath5 , i.e. the correlation is reflecting a physical relation with a confidence of @xmath6 .",
    "the conclusion , consequently , seems to be that _ there is a significant number of extreme population i objects in the parent population of low - latitude gamma - ray sources_. this result was already suggested by previous correlation studies using former gamma - ray catalogs presented by montmerle ( 1979 ) and yadigaroglu & romani ( 1997 ) , but the confidence only reaches overwhelming levels when data from the third egret catalog are used .",
    "the main mechanisms for gamma - ray production in a galactic scenario are inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of lower frequency photons , relativistic bremsstrahlung and @xmath2-decays from hadronic interactions .",
    "the common feature of all these mechanisms is that they require the presence of a population of relativistic particles ( electrons or positrons in the first two cases , protons or ions in the latter ) .",
    "consequently , if we look for gamma - ray production sites in the galaxy , we should look at sites where charged particles can be efficiently accelerated up to high energies .",
    "basically , we have two types of scenarios where particles can be accelerated up to the required relativistic energies : 1 ) large sites where the acceleration is mediated by strong shock fronts in a first order , diffusive process , and 2 ) compact objects with very strong electromagnetic fields where the acceleration occurs in a single step . the first type of acceleration is expected to occur in supernova remnants ( snrs ) and also at the strong shock that could be formed near very massive stars endowed with strong supersonic winds .",
    "the second type of acceleration should operate in pulsars and accreting black holes , where strong magnetic fields should be anchored in the surrounding accretion disks .",
    "it is natural , then , to look for positional correlations between gamma - ray sources and galactic objects like snrs , early - type stars , and ob associations ( which are considered as pulsar tracers ) , and this has been done in the past as we have briefly mentioned in the introduction .",
    "regarding the sources in the third egret catalog , romero et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have performed a correlation analysis finding out that there is a suggestive number of spatial coincidences with wolf - rayet and of stars , snrs and ob associations .",
    "the probabilities of pure chance superposition are moderate ( @xmath7 ) for stars and quite negligible for remnants and star forming regions ( @xmath8 ) . in the next sections we shall discuss these potential gamma - ray emitters in more detail , with emphasis in the case of stars .",
    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are very massive objects that have burnt their hydrogen and have entered in the final phases of their evolution .",
    "these stars present very strong supersonic winds with velocities of several thousands of km / s .",
    "the mass loss rate is as high as @xmath9 @xmath10/yr .",
    "of stars are also early - type stars with strong winds ; they are thought to be the progenitors of wr stars and , although their winds are not so strong , they have mass loss rates that can be @xmath11 times higher than those presented by stars like the sun .",
    "the energy losses experienced by all these stars through their winds have a great impact in the surrounding interstellar medium . the winds swept up the ambient gas creating low - density cavities around the stars ( e.g. benaglia & cappa 1999 ) .",
    "a strong shock front is formed at the contact layer between the wind and the outer , colder ism .",
    "these shocks are expected to accelerate particles up to high - energies through fermi mechanism ( e.g. vlk & forman 1982 ) .",
    "if a source of uv photons or a cloud are present near the acceleration site , significant amounts of gamma - rays could be produced through ic scattering , bremsstrahlung or hadronic interactions ( benaglia et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the winds of early - type stars are radiatively driven by absorption in spectral lines and are prone to undergo instabilities that can grow up to form strong shocks at the base of the outflow ( lucy & white 1980 , lucy 1982 ) .",
    "these shocks can efficiently accelerate both electrons and protons up to energies of about a few gev ( white 1985 ) , and these particles , through interactions with stellar photons and ions , could yield gamma - ray emission in egret s energy range ( benaglia et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "another site where stellar high - energy emission can be generated is the colliding winds region in binary systems formed by two massive stars ( eichler & usov 1993 ) .",
    "electrons are accelerated at the strong shock formed by the winds collision , as evidenced by the clear detection of non - thermal radio emission from the region between stars in several systems ( e.g. contreras et al .",
    "gamma - rays should be produced by comptonization of stellar photons in this region .",

    "the expected luminosities are shown in table 3 and can be considered as representative for similar systems .    both integral and glast missions will provide new and valuable elements to test our ideas about how gamma - rays can be generated in stars . in particular , the imager on board integral satellite ( ibis ) , a coded masked detector designed to produce sky images in the 20 kev  10 mev band with an angular resolution of 12 arcminutes , is expected to detect the ic flux density in a few , nearby stars that have been already found to be non - thermal radio sources .",
    "this instrument will also have a good spectral capability that could be used to differentiate stars where the high - energy emission comes from particles accelerated at a single shock ( e.g. the shock formed by winds collision ) from those where the emission is produced by particles accelerated at multiple shocks at the base of the wind ( e.g. chen & white 1991 ) .",
    "the main limitations of ibis are the sensitivity ( long integrations of @xmath49 seconds will be necessary to detect even the nearest stars ) and the fact that @xmath2-decays produce gamma - rays of energy well above instrument s energy range .",

( these proceedings ) discuss in detail the case for the association of snr and 3eg sources . if we exclude sources that are suspected to be artifacts , we have that 19 out 75 low - latitude egret detections are positionally coincident with snr in green s ( 2000 ) catalog ( see also romero et al .",
    "the probability of all these associations being the mere effect of chance is quite negligible : @xmath50 .",

    "1998 for further details ) .",
    "ob associations are considered as tracers of young pulsar concentrations ( kaaret & cottam 1996 ) . taking into account the distribution of pulsar transverse speeds derived by lyne & lorimer ( 1994 )",
    ", it has been estimated that a fraction of @xmath52 of all young pulsars ( ages less than @xmath53 yr ) can be found within @xmath54 from the center of ob associations ( kaaret & cottam 1996 ) .",
    "a correlation analysis using the 3eg catalog and melnik & efremov s ( 1995 ) ob associations catalog indicates that 26 low - latitude gamma - ray sources are superposed to ob associations .",

    "the idea that most of the gamma - ray sources in this group are pulsars is supported by the particularly hard spectra presented by them .",

    "the nature of this group of sources is , perhaps , one of the most interesting problems aroused by egret .",
    "a comparative analysis of the gamma - ray variability properties of these sources could provide some clues on their origin .",
    "gamma - ray pulsars are expected not to vary over relatively short timescales , so the identification of clearly variable galactic sources could lead to the discovery of a new population of gamma - ray emitters in the galaxy ( tavani et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "a variability analysis for the group of sources without positional correlation has been performed by romero et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and torres et al .",
    "they have used a statistical method widely applied to blazar studies ( romero et al . 1994 ) . although this method is applied to the catalog data , it is free of several problems that affect similar methods ( see reimer , this proceedings , and tompkins 1999 ) .",
    "basically , a variability index @xmath58 is introduced , where @xmath59 is the fluctuation index of the gamma - ray source and @xmath60 is the averaged fluctuation index of all known gamma - ray pulsars ( which are usually considered as a non - variable population ) .",
    "sources with @xmath61 at @xmath62 or more are considered as possibly variable ones ( @xmath63 ) . in the estimate of the fluctuation index of known gamma - ray pulsars",
    "only data from the 3eg catalog are considered . in the limits of very variable and",
    "non - variable sources this method yields similar results to the most comprehensive method applied by tompkins ( 1999 ) , who worked with the raw data and took into account background fluctuations , source contamination , and other sources of systematic error .",
    "the basic results of the variability analysis of the low - latitude , uncorrelated gamma - ray sources in the 3eg catalog are shown in figure 5 as a plot of variability index @xmath64 versus the high - energy spectral index @xmath56 .",
    "agns and pulsars are also shown in this plot for comparison .",
    "known pulsars are located between the two solid lines at the bottom of the panel . since they also have hard spectra , they are concentrated towards the left side of the frame .",
    "agns , on the contrary , mostly display high variability levels and in many occasions steep spectra .",
    "it can be clearly seen from the plot that there is a group of unidentified sources with a behaviour similar to that presented by agns .",
    "the surface density of these sources is , however , much higher than what could be expected through an extrapolation of the high - latitude agn density towards the galactic plane .",
    "actually , there seems to be a trend among these sources in the sense that those with the highest variability levels also present the steepest spectral indices .",
    "these sources seems to form a population of galactic , variable sources , of which gro j1838 - 04 ( tavani et al . 1997 ) and 3eg j1828 + 0142 ( punsly et al . 2000 ) are extreme examples .",
    "the nature of the variable low - latitude sources remains a mystery .",
    "the large error boxes of the egret detections make very difficult the identification of potential lower frequency counterparts .",
    "a single radio field of @xmath54 around the centre of the egret 95 % probability location contour can contain as many as 50 point - like weak radio sources , most of which are also of unknown nature ( torres et al .",
    "although only the improved angular resolution of glast will allow to isolate the more promising candidates for counterparts and lead to a final identification , we can speculate about some possibilities on the nature of these sources . among the main ones",
    ", we can mention :    * _ early - type stars with strong winds_. in our study of the positional correlation of sources in the 3eg catalog with massive stars we have only included extreme stars like wr and of stars",
    ". however , other o and b stars can also be sources of gamma - ray emission strong enough as to be detected by egret , especially if they are forming binary systems ( eichler & usov 1993 , benaglia et al .",

    "the luminosity of these stars should not be very high , say around a few times @xmath65 erg s@xmath17 ( benaglia et al . 2000 ) , so only nearby sources would be detected .",

    "_ pulsars_. pulsars , under certain circumstances , can be variable sources .",
    "for instance , when a pulsar forms a non - accreting binary system with a massive star , it could be subjected to a changing uv photon bath from the star ( e.g. tavani & arons 1997 ) .",
    "isolated pulsars also could be variable through some kind of quake - driven activity .",

    "other , yet undetected microquasars could switch between high and low states due to periodic accretion instabilities .",
    "recent evidence seems to show that ls 5039 displays short - term radio variability .",
    "if ic gamma - ray emission is associated with the radio emission , it should also be variable .",
    "* _ isolated black holes accreting from the interstellar medium_. bondi - hoyle accretion of diffuse matter onto black holes of several solar masses can yield moderate gamma - ray luminosities ( dermer 1997 ) . if the hole is moving through an inhomogeneous medium , variable emission could be observed . * _ non - pulsating ( np ) black holes_. maximally rotating kerr - newman black holes ( see punsly , these proceedings , and references therein ) can support a magnetosphere and , if they are located in a low - density medium , could , in principle , be gamma - ray sources ( punsly 1998a , b ) .",
    "variability naturally results from jet instabilities .",
    "a model of this kind has been recently applied to the source 3eg j1828 + 0142 ( punsly et al . 2000 ) .",
