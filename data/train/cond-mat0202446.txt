    ", the high-@xmath0 cuprates have a much lower phase stiffness and hence , are expected to show strong fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter @xcite . here",
    ", an s - wave order parameter was assumed for simplicity , whereas these materials are mainly d - wave , but our calculation could in principle be generalized to this latter situation .",
    "the two main differences between s - wave and d - wave materials are the following : first , in a d - wave material , there are nodes in the order parameter in specific directions , which results in a finite density of states for quasiparticles near the superconductor chemical potential .",
    "second , low energy andreev bound states may exist at this energy . depending on the orientation of momentum , an electron - like quasiparticle and a hole - like quasiparticle in the superconductor",
    "see an order parameter with the opposite sign @xcite .",
    "this generates a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) which is a hallmark of a d - wave order parameter .    at first sight , and for ideal interfaces , the connection of between our s - wave model and a d - wave compound could be made by first choosing the antinodal direction to be orthogonal to the plane of the interface @xcite , second by restricting electron transfer along the normal of this interface .",
    "nevertheless , the confrontation of our theoretical results with transport experiments in high-@xmath197 compounds may prove too difficult , as surface defects are likely to be present in such compounds .",
    "such defects are responsible for a reduction of the order parameter in the vicinity of the junction .",
    "moreover , the presence of andreev bound states  also induced by the impurities at the interface  renders the present approach inadequate .",
    "furthermore , surface roughness provokes a randomization of the tunneling directions so that the above scenario for antinodal tunneling loses its practicality .",
    "previous theoretical works addressing the role of phase fluctuations @xcite on andreev reflexion in the pseudogap phase @xcite focussed on the mildly underdoped case : the hole density is chosen on the right hand side of the zero temperature insulator - superconductor quantum critical point ( qcp ) . in this regime",
    "quantum fluctuations may renormalized the superfluid density but the physics turns out to be essentially that of the two - dimensional classical xy model ( renormalized classical regime in the spirit of the @xmath198 , non - linear @xmath199-model ) .",
    "transverse superfluid velocity fluctuations due to the motion of vortices are expected to dominate . because the time scales for the vortex motion , as measured by thz spectroscopy @xcite are much larger than the andreev time @xmath200 ,",
    "the correlation of the phase was treated as static ( on the scale of @xmath201 ) .",
    "the phase correlator decays in space over a lengthscale @xmath202 which is the classical correlation length @xcite .",
    "if tunneling occurs on an area which is much smaller than @xmath202 , then an andreev signal is expected .    our calculation ( albeit in 1 dimension ) , focuses on quantum fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations are included in a non - perturbative and systematic manner , regardless of the phase propagator which is used in the end . as a general trend",
    ", quantum fluctuations were found to have a tendency to reduce the andreev reflexion signal .",
    "note that other models of pseudogap also rely partly on quantum fluctuations @xcite , while others incorporate aspects of 1d physics ( stripes ) @xcite .",
    "extensions of our calculation beyond 1d  together with surface roughness  or with competing orders could be envisioned to achieve a more realistic description of stm experiments on high-@xmath0 compounds .",
