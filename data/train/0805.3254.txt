    "rotating accretion flows with viscosity and angular momentum transfer can be divided into several classes , depending on different structures and energy transfer mechanisms in the flows : advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) , advection - dominated inflow - outflows ( adios ) , convection - dominated accretion flows ( cdafs ) , neutrino - dominated accretion flows ( ndafs ) and magnetically - dominated accretion flows ( mdafs ) .",
    "adafs were introduced by ichimaru ( 1977 ) and then have been widely studied over thirty years .",
    "the opically - thick adafs with super - eddington accretion rates were discussed by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1988 ) in details ( see also begelman et al .",
    "1982 ; eggum et al . 1988 ) . the optically - thin adafs with low , sub - eddington accretion rates were discussed by rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ) ( see also ichimaru 1977 ; abramowicz et al . 1995 ; gammie & popham 1998 ; popham & gammie 1998 ; wang & zhou 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , narayan & yi ( 1994 ) introduced self - similar solutions for adafs with the fixed ratio of the advective cooling rate to the viscous heating rate in the disk .",
    "wang & zhou ( 1999 ) solved self - similar solutions for optically - thick adafs .",
    "the effects of general relativity were considered in gammie & popham ( 1998 ) and popham & gammie ( 1998 ) .",
    "cdafs were presented in details in narayan et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter nia ) .",
    "they discussed the effects of convection on angular momentum and energy transport , and presented the relations between the convective coefficient @xmath3 and the classical viscosity parameter @xmath12 .",
    "a non - accreting solution can be obtained when convection moves angular momentum inward and the viscosity parameter @xmath12 is small .",
    "later , a series of works have been published to discuss the disk structure , the mhd instability , the condition of angular momentum transport in cdafs ( e.g. , igumenshchev et al . 2000 , 2002 , 2003 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ; narayan et al . 2002 ; igumenshchev 2002 ; lu et al .",
    "2004 ; van der swaluw et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the effects of a magnetic field on the disk were also studied ( see balbus & hawley 1998 ; kaburiki 2000 ; shadmehri 2004 ; meier 2005 ; shadmehri & khajenabi 2005 , 2006 ; akizuki & fukue 2006 ; ghanbari et al .",
    "balbus & hawley ( 1998 ) discussed the mhd turbulence initiated by magnetorotational instability ( mri ) and its effects on the angular momentum transportation .",
    "kaburaki ( 2000 ) considered an analytic model to describe the adafs with a global magnetic field and meier ( 2005 ) considered how a turbulent and magnetized disk creates a global well - ordered magnetic field , and introduced a magnetically - dominated flow .",
    "shadmehri ( 2004 ) and chanbari et al . (",
    "2007 ) discussed the self - similar structure of the magnetized adafs in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "moreover , shamehri & khajenabi ( 2005 , 2006 , hereafter sk05 , sk06 ) presented self - similar solutions of flows based on the vertically integrated equations .",
    "they discussed the relations between magnetic fields components in different directions , and mainly focused on the effects of the magnetic field on the disk structure .",
    "akizuki & fukue ( 2006 , hereafter af06 ) , different from sk05 and sk06 , emphasized an intermediate case where the magnetic force is comparable to other forces by assuming the physical variables in the disk only as functions of radius .",
    "however , they merely discussed a global toroidal magnetic field in the disk .    in this paper",
    ", we first extend the work of af06 by considering a general large - scale magnetic field in all the three components in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath0 ) and then discuss effects of the global magnetic field on the flows with convection .",
    "we adopt the treatment that the flow variables are functions of the disk radius , neglect the different structure in the vertical direction except for the @xmath13-component momentum equation .",
    "we also discuss magnetized accretion flows with convection , and compare our results with those in nia , in which a large - scale magnetic field is neglected .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : basic equations are presented in  2 .",
    "we obtain self - similar solutions in  3 and discuss the effects of a general large - scale magnetic field on the disk flow . in ",
    "4 we investigate the structure and physical variables in magnetized cdafs , and present the relation of the convective parameter @xmath3 and the classical viscosity parameter @xmath12 . we adopt a more realistic form of the kinematic viscosity in  5 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "in this paper , we use all quantities with their usual meanings : @xmath14 is the radius of the disk , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the radial and rotation velocity , @xmath17 is the angular velocity of the disk , @xmath18 is the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath19 is the disk surface density with @xmath20 to be the disk density and @xmath21 to be the half - thickness , and @xmath22 is the isothermal sound speed with @xmath23 to be the gas pressure in the disk .    moreover , we consider a magnetic field in the disk with three components @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we define the alfvn sound speeds @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in three directions of the cylindrical coordinates as @xmath30 .",
    "we consider that all flow variables are only functions of radius @xmath14 , and write basic equations , i.e. , the continuity equation , the three components ( @xmath31 ) of the momentum equation and the energy equation :    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    here we consider the height - integrated equations using the classical @xmath12-prescription model with @xmath12 to be the viscosity parameter , and use the newtonian gravitational potential . in the mass continuity equation , we also consider the mass loss term @xmath37 . in the energy equation",
    "we take @xmath38 to be the adiabatic index of the disk gas and @xmath39 to measure the degree to which the flow is advection - dominated ( ny94 ) , and neglect the joule heating rate .    in af06 , a general case of viscosity @xmath40 with @xmath41 to be a parameter is mentioned .",
    "if the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the gas pressure is constant ( as assumed in the self - similar structure ) , the solution of the basic equations can be obtained with replacing @xmath12 by @xmath42 . in our paper , however , we first adopt the classical form @xmath43 for simplicity in  3 and  4 , in which we mainly focus on the effects of a magnetic field on the variables @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath6 .",
    "a more realistic model requires @xmath2 with both @xmath6 and @xmath21 as functions of the magnetic field strength .",
    "we discuss this model in  5 and compare it with the results in  3 and  4 .",
    "our equations are somewhat different from those in sk05 and sk06 , since we only consider the disk variables as functions of radius @xmath14 , while sk05 and sk06 discuss the magnetic field structure in the vertical direction .",
    "more details about the basic equations are discussed in appendix a. when @xmath44 and @xmath45 , our equations switch back to the equations in af06 , in which only the toroidal magnetic field is considered and all the variables are taken to depend merely on radius @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , we need the the three - component induction equations to measure the magnetic field escaping rate : @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48",
    "if we assume the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the energy equation are independent of radius @xmath14 , then we can adopt a self - similar treatment similar to ny94 and af06 , @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    where the coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are similar to those in af06 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 measure the ratio of the magnetic pressure in three directions to the gas pressure , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "following af06 , we also denote the structure of the surface density @xmath60 by @xmath61 the half - thickness of the disk still satisfies the relation @xmath62 and we obtain @xmath63    substituting self - similar relations ( [ e201])([e206 ] ) to equations ( [ e11 ] ) , ( [ e12 ] ) and ( [ e131 ] ) , we can obtain the algebraic equations of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath64c_{3},\\label{e207}\\ ] ]    @xmath65    @xmath66    if in the cylindrical coordinates we assume the three components of magnetic field @xmath67 , then @xmath68 can be either positive or negative , depending on the detailed magnetic field structure in the disk . in a particular case",
    "where @xmath44 or @xmath69 , we can only obtain the value of @xmath70 , but in a general case where @xmath71 , we are able to determine the value of @xmath54",
    ".    figures 1 and 2 show the self - similar coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath70 and @xmath55 as functions of the advection parameter @xmath39 with different @xmath72 .",
    "we consider the disk to be radiation dominated with @xmath73 , and take @xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath75 as the common case ) and the viscosity parameter @xmath76 , which is the widely used value .",
    "figure 1 shows changes of the coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath70 , @xmath55 with @xmath58 and @xmath57 .",
    "we neglect the radial magnetic fields @xmath24 , and take the parameters @xmath77 in the left three panels in figure 1 for ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 3 ) and ( 0 , 1 , 10 ) , and then take the value of @xmath57 to be 10 in the right three panels . as @xmath78 , we can only obtain @xmath70 without needing to determine the direction of @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath55 increase with increasing the advection parameter @xmath39 , but @xmath70 decreases monotonously as a function of @xmath39 except for a strong toroidal magnetic field .",
    "moreover , with the fixed ratio @xmath58 , an increase of @xmath57 makes all the coefficients @xmath79 become larger .",
    "oppositely , @xmath79 decreases with increasing @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , with a small radial magnetic field @xmath80 , we can obtain an analytical solution of @xmath81 from equations ( [ e207])-([e209 ] ) , which are similar to expressions ( 27)-(29 ) in af06 , but we should replace @xmath82 by @xmath83 and @xmath84 by @xmath57 in those expressions instead . also , we have @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 for large @xmath57 and @xmath88 for large @xmath58 , all of which are consistent with the results in figure 1 .    as a result , from figure 1 , we first find that a strong toroidal magnetic field leads to an increase of the infall velocity @xmath5 , rotation velocity @xmath7 and isothermal sound speed @xmath6 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are large in the case where the disk flow is mainly advection - dominated , but the rotation velocity @xmath7 increases with increasing @xmath39 only in the case where the toroidal magnetic field is large enough .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the case 1 in af06 .",
    "second , the high ratio @xmath58 decreases the value of @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 , which means that a strong magnetic pressure in the vertical direction prevents the disk matter from being accreted , and decreases the effect of gas pressure as accretion proceeds .",
    "figure 2 shows how @xmath53 , @xmath70 and @xmath55 change with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where we neglect the vertical magnetic @xmath26 . for a small value of @xmath56 , the coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath70 and @xmath55 also increase with increasing @xmath57 .",
    "however , a change of @xmath81 is not obvious for a large value of @xmath56 .",
    "we are able to calculate the limiting value of @xmath81 in the extreme case where @xmath56 is large enough and @xmath89 using an analytical method . from equations ( [ e207])-([e209 ] ) ,",
    "we can obtain @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 for large @xmath56 , where @xmath92 . if @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which means that the infall velocity @xmath5 increases with advection parameter @xmath39 linearly , and the radial velocity @xmath7 is nearly the keplerian velocity , no matter whether the disk is efficiently cooled or not .",
    "also , for a large value of @xmath56 , equation ( [ e208 ] ) becomes @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97 in the accretion disk , we obtain @xmath98 , which means that the direction of rotation in the disk is opposite to the toroidal magnetic field @xmath25 .",
    "actually , in the case where @xmath56 is sufficient large and @xmath99 , the angular momentum transported due to the magnetic field stress is dominated over that due to the viscosity , and balances with the advection angular momentum .",
    "as we take @xmath67 , from equation ( [ e12 ] ) , we obtain that the large angular momentum due to the magnetic field stress makes the value of the advection angular momentum ( @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the mass accretion rate ) increase in the disk , which requires @xmath102 in the self - similar structure to be negative .",
    "the advection transports angular momentum inward , while the magnetic stress transports angular momentum outward instead .",
    "this previous result is consistent with our result here if we change the cylindrical coordinate used above from ( @xmath31 ) to ( @xmath103 ) . in this paper",
    "it is convenient for us to take @xmath67 and to obtain s series of self - similar solutions about magnetized flows in many different cases . ] .    from the mass - continuity equation ( [ e10 ] ) and",
    "the induction equations ( [ e14])-([e16 ] ) as well as the solved coefficients @xmath81 , we can solve the self - similar structure of the mass loss and magnetic field escaping rate with forms of @xmath104 and @xmath105 where @xmath106 satisfies    @xmath107    as mentioned in af06 , when @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath108 or @xmath75 , there is no wind in the disk , and thus we can use the formula @xmath109 to determine the surface density @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , in the region of the disk where is adiabatic with @xmath110 ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) , we obtain the self - similar solution of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , which describe the bondi accretion .",
    "however , if the disk region satisfies the entropy - conservation condition with @xmath114 , we can still obtain an accretion - disk solution beyond the self - similar treatment .",
    "for a cdaf with @xmath115 ( nia ) , a steady disk without wind requires @xmath116 or @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118 satisfy @xmath119    @xmath120    @xmath121    where @xmath122 in the expression ( [ e206 ] ) can be obtained from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( [ e13 ] ) , that is , @xmath123,\\label{e213}\\ ] ] and thus we obtain the half - thickness of the disk @xmath124 .",
    "we will discuss the effects of the magnetic field on @xmath21 later in  5 .",
    "in cadfs , both advection and convection play contributions to the angular momentum and energy transportation .",
    "we propose a cdaf model in a global magnetic field in order to compare it with non - globally - magnetized cdafs .",
    "we follow the idea of nia in this section and consider the effect of a magnetic field)-prescription following nia .",
    "the mhd simulations beyond this prescription can be seen in igumenshchev et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) , hawley & balbus ( 2002 ) and so on .",
    "moreover , quataert & gruzinov ( 2000 ) also develop an analytical model for cdafs . ] .",
    "the viscosity angular momentum flux is @xmath125 and the convection angular momentum flux can be written as @xmath126 where @xmath3 is the dimensionless coefficient to measure the strength of convective diffusion , @xmath11 is the parameter to determine the condition of convective angular momentum transport .",
    "convection transports angular momentum inward ( or outward ) for @xmath127 ( or @xmath128 ) .",
    "the energy equation of a cadf is @xmath129 where the convective energy flux @xmath130 is @xmath131 where we still consider the general energy equation without vertical integration as in nia , and still neglect the joule heating rate .    using the angular momentum equation , the energy equation of the cdaf and the self - similar structure ( [ e201])-([e206 ] )",
    ", we can obtain the relevant algebraic equations of self - similar structure of the cdaf , @xmath132",
    "@xmath133    the radial momentum equation is still the same as that in adaf . combining equation ( [ e207 ] ) , ( [ e304 ] ) and ( [ e305 ] )",
    ", we can finally solve the coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 in the case of cdaf and compare them with those in adaf .",
    "the dimensionless coefficient @xmath3 can be calculated using the mixing length theory , and we adopt equation ( 15 ) in nia , who describes the relation of @xmath3 with @xmath134 , @xmath55 and @xmath38 ( in nia , they used the symbols @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 , and @xmath138 in our paper ) .    to simplify the problem , we first prefer using a simpler treatment with a fixed @xmath3 to discussing the solutions of ( [ e207 ] ) , ( [ e304 ] ) and ( [ e305 ] ) , i.e. , we take @xmath3 as a free parameter rather than a calculated variable , since @xmath3 does not dramatically change in many cases .",
    "then we can adopt a similar treatment as in  3 to solve equations ( [ e207 ] ) , ( [ e304 ] ) and ( [ e305 ] ) .",
    "similarly as in  3 , we first use the analytical method to discuss some particular cases .",
    "when @xmath139 ( which implies that the radial or toroidal magnetic fields are weak ) , we can obtain an analytical solution similar to that in  3 ( see appendix b for more details about the calculation ) .",
    "we discuss two cases .",
    "one is that the toroidal magnetic field @xmath25 is dominated and the radial magnetic field is weak ( @xmath140 ) .",

    "@xmath152 , we get @xmath98 , which has also been obtained in  3 .",
    "figure 3 shows some examples of the effect of the convection parameter @xmath3 on the three coefficients @xmath81 . in order to see the results clearly , we take @xmath153 and change the value of @xmath3 from 0 to 0.9 with several sets of magnetic field parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58)@xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "also we set @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath157 .",
    "the basic results in figure 3 are consistent with the above discussion using the analytical method . in particular",
    ", we notice that the three coefficients do not change dramatically in the case of @xmath158 , since the magnetic field gives a contribution to the angular momentum rather than the viscosity , and reduces the effect of convection on the disk .",
    "next we want to obtain the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath12 following nia , i.e. , we consider @xmath3 to be the variable as a function of @xmath134 , @xmath38 and @xmath55 . using the treatment in nia based on the mixing length theory and equations ( [ e207 ] ) , ( [ e304 ] ) and ( [ e305 ] ) , we can establish the @xmath3-@xmath12 relation .",
    "nia discussed such a relation with @xmath159 and @xmath157 , and find that the solution with @xmath74 is available only for @xmath12 greater than a certain critical @xmath160 when the isothermal sound speed reaches its maximum value , and the value of @xmath3 decreases monotonously as @xmath12 increases .",
    "however , our results are quite different from those in nia for two reasons .",
    "first , we keep the term @xmath161 in the radial momentum equation , while in nia this term is neglected . as a result , in many cases , the sound speed to determine the actual critical @xmath12 for available solutions does not reach exactly its maximum value .",
    "second and more importantly , we consider the effect of the large - scale magnetic field on the disk .    from equation ( [ e207 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath162c_{3}-1 < 0.\\label{e3092}\\ ] ] if the radial magnetic field is weak , then we have @xmath163^{-1}$ ] for a large vertical magnetic field and @xmath164 $ ] for a large toroidal magnetic field . on the other hand , from nia",
    ", we have @xmath165 $ ] for the convective process to be available .",
    "therefore , the structure of flows with convection can not be maintained for a large vertical magnetic field . moreover , if the term @xmath166 is large , we still obtain a small value of @xmath167 with a small value of @xmath3 , which is almost independent of the variation of @xmath12 .",
    "figure 4 shows examples of the @xmath4 relation with different magnetic field structures .",
    "we take @xmath168 and @xmath74 .",
    "the left panel shows the @xmath4 relation with different values of @xmath57 .",
    "when the magnetic field is small ( @xmath57=0 and 1 in this panel ) , @xmath3 decreases with increasing @xmath12 , and @xmath12 has its critical ( minimum ) value for the solution to be available .",
    "these results are basically consistent with those in nia . however , when @xmath57 becomes large , @xmath3 increases as the viscosity parameter @xmath12 increases , and the critical value of @xmath12 becomes extremely small or even disappears .",
    "the right panel of figure 4 shows the @xmath4 relation with different values of @xmath58 .",

    "this result is quite different from nia , who found that only the minimum value of @xmath12 exists and becomes important .    from the above discussion ,",
    "we conclude that a strong vertical magnetic field or large @xmath166 prevents the convective process in flows , while a moderate vertical magnetic field is available for small @xmath12 .",
    "a strong toroidal magnetic field with weak radial field makes the convective process become important even for large @xmath12 in flows .    in nia ,",
    "a self - similar convection - driven non - accreting solution with @xmath169 ( i.e. @xmath170 ) was given for @xmath171 when @xmath12 is smaller than the critical value @xmath160 .",

    "in fact , we are still able to get a self - similar structure for magnetized cdafs when the @xmath4 relation mentioned is no longer satisfied ( i.e. , inequality ( [ e3092 ] ) is not satisfied ) . for @xmath89 , the zero infall velocity ( i.e. @xmath116 )",

    "( 2003 ) , who explained the structure as a result of vertical leakage of convective energy flux from the disk . in our model ,",
    "however , we show that this structure is due to the inefficient angular momentum transfer by viscosity and the zero lorentz force in the @xmath177-direction .    as a result",
    ", we obtained a self - similar solution for magnetized cdafs with @xmath116 , @xmath172 or @xmath175 ( for the general form ) and @xmath10 .",
    "this solution is adopted when the normal self - similar solutions mentioned above for convective flows can not be satisfied .",

    "figure 5 shows the effect of a modified kinematic viscosity on the three coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath70 and @xmath55 in adafs . a more realistic expression of @xmath179 increases the infall velocity , but decreases the radial velocity and the isothermal sound speed .",

    "in fact , if the toroidal magnetic field @xmath25 is strong and dominated in ( @xmath191 ) , we can adopt a similar solution of ( 49)-(51 ) in af06 for @xmath185 , and find that @xmath53 increases but @xmath70 and @xmath55 reaches their limiting values with increasing @xmath57 . if the radial magnetic field @xmath24 is strong and dominated , we can obtain @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 , which are different from  3 in which @xmath95 for large @xmath56 . furthermore , if @xmath58 is large enough , we have the limiting value @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , and the values of @xmath70 and @xmath55 are more or less the same , no matter what the form of kinematic viscosity is .    for flows with convection , it is convenient for us to adopt the general definition of @xmath3 from nia , which measures a degree of convection in the flows .",
    "we find that the conclusions in  4 are not basically changed if we replace @xmath12 in  4 by @xmath180 .",
    "the @xmath198 relation can be turned back to the @xmath199 relation using equation ( [ e601 ] ) .",
    "however , there is no dramatic change between these two relations except for extremely strong magnetic fields .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects of a global magnetic field on viscously - rotating and vertically - integrated accretion disks around compact objects using a self - similar treatment .",
    "our conclusions are listed as follows :    \\(1 ) we have extended akizuki and fukue s self - similar solutions ( 2006 ) by considering a three - component magnetic field @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 in adafs . if we set the kinematic viscosity @xmath43 as its classical form , then with the flow to be advection - dominated , the infall velocity @xmath5 and the isothermal sound speed @xmath6 increase , and even the radial velocity @xmath7 can exceed the keplerian velocity with a strong toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the strong magnetic field in the vertical direction prevents the disk from being accreted , and decreases the effect of the gas pressure . for a large radial magnetic field , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath6 can reach their limiting values , and the direction of radial velocity is actually negative , since the angular momentum transfer due to the magnetic field stress in this case",
    "is dominated over that due to the viscosity in the disk , and makes the value of advection angular momentum increase inward .",
    "\\(2 ) if the convective coefficient @xmath3 in flows is set as a free parameter , @xmath5 and @xmath6 increase with increasing @xmath3 for large @xmath25 and weak @xmath24 . also , @xmath5 becomes smaller and @xmath7 becomes larger ( or smaller ) with increasing @xmath3 for a strong and dominated radial ( or vertical ) magnetic field .",
    "\\(3 ) the @xmath4 relation in the magnetized disk is different from that in the non - magnetized disk . for large @xmath25 and weak @xmath24",
    ", @xmath3 increases with increasing @xmath12 , the critical value @xmath160 to determine different cases of the @xmath4 relation disappears , and @xmath108 can be satisfied for any value of @xmath12 .",
    "a moderate vertical magnetic field is available for small @xmath12 .",
    "the large @xmath26 or @xmath200 , on the other hand , prevents the convective process in flows .",
    "\\(4 ) the self - similar convection envelope solution in nia should be replaced by @xmath116 , @xmath201 and @xmath172 ( @xmath9 ) for the vertical integration form of angular equations and @xmath175 ( @xmath8 ) for the general form in magnetized cdafs .",
    "this solution can be adopted in the region that does not satisfy the normal self - similar solutions for flows with convection and @xmath202 .",
    "\\(5 ) the magnetic field increases the disk height @xmath21 for large @xmath24 and @xmath25 , but decreases it for large @xmath26 in the magnetized disk . a more realistic model of the kinematic viscosity @xmath2 makes the infall velocity in adafs increase and the sound speed and toroidal velocity decrease compared with the simple case when the form @xmath43 is assumed .",

    "the momentum equation of accretion flows can be written as ( frank et al .",

    "also , the ampre s law and the induction equation ( faraday s law ) are @xmath206      where @xmath208 is the magnetic diffusivity and @xmath209 is the electrical conductivity . for simplicity , we consider the extreme case that @xmath210 and @xmath211 , and then neglect the second term in the right side of the induction equation ( [ e403 ] ) . combining equations ( [ e401 ] ) and ( [ e402 ] ) , we can obtain the three components of the momentum equation .",
    "in particular , the three components of the lorentz force in the cylindrical coordinates are @xmath212        based on the consideration that all flow variables including the magnetic field are mainly functions of radius @xmath14 , we can conclude @xmath215 and @xmath216 . or a more realistic consideration requires @xmath217 . also , we take @xmath218 for the axisymmetric disk .",

    "however , in this paper we take the magnetic field to be homogeneous in the vertical direction and neglect the term of @xmath225 as mentioned above except for the @xmath13-component equation , in which we take the total pressure as @xmath226 in the vertical direction , and adopt @xmath227 to estimate the value of @xmath21 . in  2 , we use the height - integration equations .",
