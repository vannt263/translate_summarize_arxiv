    "the lhc will soon begin operations in earnest and will thereafter begin a detailed study of the terascale . amongst the many prospective new physics signals that may be realized at the lhc , the possible observation of an excess of events with missing energy is awaited with great anticipation .",
    "given the strong collection of evidence for the existence of dark matter @xcite and the naturalness of the wimp paradigm @xcite , it is no surprise that many beyond the standard model ( sm ) scenarios predict the appearance of missing energy signatures at the lhc @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most well explored of these scenarios is r - parity conserving , n=1 supersymmetry ( susy ) where the wimp is identified as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which most commonly corresponds to the lightest neutralino or gravitino .",
    "the simplest manifestation of this picture is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where the gauge group of the sm is maintained and the matter content of the sm is augmented only by an additional higgs doublet .",
    "while the mssm has many nice features , perhaps its least understood aspect is the nature of the mechanism which breaks the supersymmetry .",
    "there is an ever growing list of possible candidate scenarios , including msugra @xcite , gmsb @xcite , amsb @xcite , and gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "each of these mechanisms strongly influences both the mass spectra and decay patterns of the various sparticles and hence it is highly non - trivial to make model - independent statements about the properties of the lsp or about susy signatures at colliders such as the lhc .",
    "this puts forth the question of whether there is some way to study the mssm in a broad fashion while simultaneously adopting as few simplifying assumptions as possible .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address this issue . in trying to answer this question ,",
    "one is immediately faced with the daunting task of dealing with the over 120 parameters , arising mainly in the soft - breaking sector , which describe susy breaking in the mssm @xcite .",
    "clearly the phenomenological study of any model with such a large number of parameters is totally hopeless .",
    "obviously _ some _ assumptions need to be made in order to reduce this large number of independent parameters to a viable subset and there are many possible avenues one could follow .",
    "most studies assume a specific susy breaking mechanism , employing theoretical assumptions at the gut scale , and thus reduce the number of independent model parameters to 4 or 5 . in this investigation",
    ", we will not make any assumptions at the high scale .",
    "we will , however , restrict ourselves to the cp - conserving mssm ( , no new phases ) with minimal flavor violation ( mfv)@xcite .",
    "moreover , to simplify matters further and help soften the impact of the experimental constraints arising from the flavor sector , we will require that the first two generations of sfermions be degenerate .",
    "this leaves us with 19 independent , real , weak - scale , susy lagrangian parameters to consider .",
    "these include the gaugino masses @xmath0 , the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath1 , the ratio of the higgs vevs @xmath2 , the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath3 , and the 10 squared masses of the sfermions ( 5 for the assumed degenerate first two generations and a separate 5 for the third generation ) . finally , due to the small yukawa couplings for the first two generations , independent @xmath4-terms are only phenomenologically relevant for the third generation and",
    "will be included in our study for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 sectors .",
    "this set of 19 parameters leaves us with what has been called the phenomenological mssm ( pmssm ) in the literature@xcite and is the scenario that we will study in some detail below .",
    "we note that for this study we will make the further assumption that the lsp is the neutralino and is a conventional thermal relic within the standard cosmology with a radiation dominated era .",
    "the primary goal of the first phase of this study is to obtain a large set of mssm parameter points that can be used for future studies of susy signatures , , signals at the lhc or in cosmic rays . to accomplish this",
    ", we will perform a scan over this 19-dimensional parameter space and subject the resulting specific sets of parameter choices ( which we denote as models ) to a large and well - known ( and some perhaps , not so well - known ) set of experimental and theoretical constraints@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will perform two independent scans which will employ different priors for choosing the above mass parameters ; this is important since some bias may be introduced into the analysis by how one choose parameter space points . by choosing more than one prior and comparing results",
    "this sensitivity can be estimated .",
    "we will show that while both scans yield qualitatively similar results , quantitative differences will be observed in some cases .",
    "we will perform our comparison to the experimental data with some care to identify sets of parameter space points which are at present phenomenologically viable . as we will see below , applying these constraints can be complicated and is not always as straightforward as employed in some other analyses .",
    "this is particularly true in the case where experimental bounds are predicated on specific susy breaking mechanisms .",
    "as we are not a priori interested in any particular region of parameter space ( , we are enforcing the wmap dark matter density@xcite observations only as an upper bound ) or in obtaining a set of points that provide a ` best fit ' to the data , we will not need to make use of markov - chain monte carlo techniques@xcite .",
    "we will then perform a detailed study of the properties of these surviving models and , in particular , highlight those aspects which are not generally encountered when only a given set of susy breaking scenarios is considered .",
    "this allows us to get a perspective on the wide range of predictions for various observables that can arise in the more general pmssm framework in comparison to those found in specific susy breaking scenarios .    in the next section",
    ", we will discuss our scanning techniques , the ranges of the soft breaking parameters that we employ , as well as the values of the sm input parameters that we use . in section 3",
    ", we will detail the various theoretical and experimental constraints at some length and will explain exactly how they are employed in our analysis .",
    "section 4 presents our analysis and a survey of the results , while section 5 contains an overview discussion of the lessons learned from this analysis .",
    "our conclusions can be found in section 6 .",
    "to perform our multi - dimensional parameter scan , we need to choose suitable ranges for the soft - breaking parameters that we employ and determine how the values of these parameters are picked within these assumed ranges . in the analysis presented here ,",
    "we will make two independent parameter scans . in the first case",
    ", we randomly generate @xmath7 sets of parameters , assuming flat priors , , we assume that the parameter values are chosen _ uniformly _ throughout their allowed ranges . with an eye toward the experimental constraints to be discussed in the next section , for the flat prior scan we employ the following ranges : @xmath8 note that absolute value signs are present in these quoted ranges as we will allow the soft - breaking parameters to have arbitrary sign . given that the soft parameters @xmath9 and @xmath1 can all appear with arbitrary signs ( , phases ) but that only six relative signs are physical@xcite we choose @xmath10 to be positive .",
    "this scan will generate susy spartners with light to moderate masses .    for our second scan ,",
    "we randomly generate @xmath11 sets of parameters assuming log priors for the mass parameters .",
    "we then modify the allowed soft parameter ranges as follows : @xmath12 here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this expanded range of parameters will allow us access to both very light as well as some heavy sparticle states that may only be produced at the slhc .",
    "the goal of this second scan is to make contrasts and comparisons to the flat prior study in order to determine the dependence of the model properties on the scan assumptions .",
    "the possible bias introduced by choosing a particular prior in analyses such as ours is an important problem that has been often discussed in the literature@xcite .",
    "the only way it can be properly addressed is to take more than one assumed prior , compare the results and look for differences . for the case of our two priors we will see that they yield qualitatively similar results , but the detailed predictions in the two cases will be found to be quantitatively different in several aspects .",
    "note that the above mass parameters are assumed to be evaluated at the susy scale , , by convention the geometric mean of the two stop masses @xmath15 tev .",
    "the physical spectra for the sparticles themselves are generated in all cases using the code suspect2.34@xcite .",
    "once a set of parameters is chosen , we subject the resulting mssm model to the entire set of constraints discussed in the next section ; those models which survive will be analyzed in further detail below .",
    "of course , as models are passed through each successive experimental ` filter , ' the number of surviving models will be further and further reduced .",
    "another important aspect of such a broad study is the set of input values for the sm parameters , , @xmath16 , .",
    ",  that we employ . as is well - known , some of the predictions for the various observables we analyze below can be sensitive to these particular numerical choices .",
    "while we have chosen these numerical values with some care , we are not advocating any one particular set of values for these parameters .",
    "we provide their values here only for completeness since it is important for the interested reader to know exactly how our analysis was performed .",
    "table [ smparam ] lists the values of these sm parameters used in our analysis . while we only quote central values here , many of the relevant errors",
    "are included when evaluating the set of observables we discuss in the next section .",
    "we follow this approach , rather than including the sm input values in our scan , since they are essentially known quantities unlike the pmssm parameters .",
    ".central values of the sm input parameters used in our analysis .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in conclusion , we see that the predictions of msugra are greatly extended when examining the full pmssm .",
    "in this paper we begin a detailed study of the 19 parameter , cp - conserving pmssm under the assumptions of ( @xmath17 ) minimal flavor violation , ( @xmath18 ) the lsp being identified with the lightest neutralino , ( @xmath19 ) only the yukawa couplings of the third generation are important and ( @xmath20 ) the wmap measurement of the dark matter relic density is taken only as an upper limit to that arising from the lsp . carefully subjecting numerous combinations of parameter",
    "space points , with mass terms randomly generated assuming either flat or log priors , to a large number of theoretical and experimental constraints we arrive at two sets of models that survive all of the restrictions .    with these two sets of models , we first examined the resulting distributions of expected higgs and sparticle masses ; qualitatively and even semi - quantitatively either choice of prior was found to return quite similar results except for trivially obvious differences due to how the parameters were generated . in both cases , we found some instances where surprisingly light sparticles are still allowed by the data . next , we studied the identity of the nlsp and its mass splitting with the lsp .",
    "we found that for either choice of priors , over a dozen sparticles can play the role of the nlsp with more or less the same probabilities in the two model samples .",
    "the most common nlsp identities were found to be @xmath21 and @xmath22 with other possibilities being @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "less familiar nlsp identities were also found to occur such as the gluino or the first / second generation squarks .",
    "we also showed that the mass splitting between these two states , @xmath25 , which is a critical parameter for collider signals and studies , was found to vary over a very large range of six orders of magnitude with values in excess of @xmath26 gev and as small as @xmath26 kev or less .",
    "the greatest range was found in the case where the lightest chargino was the nlsp .",
    "small values of @xmath27 were found to be quite common particularly in the case of the lightest chargino or the second lightest neutralino being the nlsp .",
    "this would imply that searches for long - lived and ( essentially ) stable particles at the lhc will be of particular importance . in some cases ,",
    "squarks and gluinos were found to be relatively light and not widely separated in mass from the corresponding lsp .",
    "the decays of such states would likely lead to soft jets in the final state which may be difficult to observe above sm backgrounds at the lhc .",
    "the mass spectra of the models we obtained were such as to substantially diminish the needed amount of fine tuning in comparison to , , msugra - based scenarios .",
    "subsequently , we examined the postdictions arising from both model sets for a number of observables such as the branching fraction for @xmath28 and the shift in the value of the @xmath29 of the muon ; these were found to be reasonably similar for both cases of priors .",
    "since the predicted dark matter density was allowed to float to any value at or below that obtained by wmap , we found that the average contribution of the lsp to dark matter peaked at @xmath30 , with long tails , implying that most of the time some other source of dark matter must typically dominate .",
    "however , we do see that there is a reasonable fraction of models where the lsp contribution to the dark matter density is , in fact , quite appreciable in comparison to the wmap measurement .",
    "these results were found to hold for either choice of priors .",
    "we then went further and examined the implications of these models for the direct detection of dark matter ; we found that the range of possible cross sections is far larger than that obtained in any of the well - known susy breaking frameworks , such as the cmssm or msugra .",
    "furthermore these ranges extended into the regions one would have expected to only arise from either the universal extra dimensions or little higgs models .",
    "this implies that these observables alone can not be used to discriminate between different terascale models .",
    "it is important to note that while the two sets of priors have led to qualitatively very similar pictures , some _ quantitative _ differences do appear as can be seen from the figures above .",
    "for example , the mass spectra of the susy particles in both cases , while qualitatively similar , are different in detail since the log prior case generally leads to smaller masses .    clearly",
    "the detailed study of the pmssm models is quite exciting as well as complex ; we are just at the initial stages of this analysis and there are many things remaining to be done which we will address in subsequent publications . in addition , we plan to make our model sets public in the near future , in order to encourage a wider set of possible analyses .",
    "hopefully we will not have to wait too long until we actually have real data from the lhc to examine .",
