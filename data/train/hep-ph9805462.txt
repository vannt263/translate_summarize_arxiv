    "in the quark model the axial - vector current form factors measured in nucleon - hyperon weak decays are related to the spin polarizations of quarks . in principle",
    "there are three quark spin polarization parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 that can be determined from the experimental data .",
    "unfortunately the four axial - vector form factors can all be expressed in term of two parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . to determine the quark spin polarizations we therefore also need the total spin polarization @xmath6 of the nucleon .",
    "the relation between the axial - vector currents and the nucleon spin has been discussed in the recent literature .",
    "et al_@xcite have performed an analysis of the recent deep inelastic scattering measurements to obtain the quark spin content and concluded that in view of current limited understanding of the nature and magnitude of su(3)@xmath0 symmetry breaking , the use of su(3 ) underestimates the uncertainties of the flavor - specific quark helicity contributions to the nucleon spin . in another paper @xcite song _ et al _",
    "have discussed small su(3 ) breaking contributions to the analysis .",
    "also lipkin @xcite and lichtenstadt and lipkin @xcite have analyzed possible su(3 ) symmetry breaking in a model to estimate its influence on the value of the axial vector form factors and its effect on the spin polarization analysis .",
    "their conclusion is that su(3 ) symmetry breaking does not have a large influence on the nucleon spin evaluation .",
    "ehrnsperger and schfer @xcite have also performed an analysis of hyperon beta decay to extract the @xmath7 ratio and study its implication on the spin polarization sum rules .",
    "they argue that there is no evidence for a strong spin polarization of the strange quark sea .",
    "ratcliffe @xcite has analyzed hyperon semi - leptonic decays and come to the conclusion that su(3 ) symmetry with some small corrections for its violation gives a very satisfactory description of the experimental data .    in all these analyses , both with and without su(3 ) symmetry breaking , the authors have used the review of particle properties ( rpp ) data set@xcite for the hyperon decays , which are obtained by assuming that the su(3 ) symmetry breaking induced form factors @xmath8 can be neglected .    in our opinion an analysis with su(3 ) breaking to evaluate the axial - vector form factors should use the best experimental results available in the literature , including the symmetry breaking form factor @xmath8 .",
    "this is the attitude adopted in the present work and elaborated upon later . using the rpp data",
    "set already presumes that the symmetry breaking effects are small .",
    "this is clearly undesirable in an analysis of such effects .    in two earlier papers@xcite",
    "we have discussed the magnetic moments of baryons in an extension of the quark model , which allows for general flavor symmetry breaking and where the quark magnetic moments are allowed to vary with the isomultiplet @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic moments of the baryons in this model can be written as a linear sum of contributions from the various flavors @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective magnetic moment of the quark of flavor @xmath12 in the isomultiplet @xmath9 and @xmath13 is the corresponding spin polarization for baryon @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the baryon charge state . by symmetry arguments",
    "the @xmath13 s in the octet baryons can be expressed as constant linear combinations of the three @xmath16 s for the proton , which are the only spin polarizations needed to describe the octet : @xmath17 where @xmath18 runs over @xmath19 , and the @xmath20 s are matrices with constant elements .",
    "in particular for the six mirror symmetric baryons of type @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are different flavors , we have @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the flavor @xmath27 is the non - valence quark flavor .    in the non - relativistic quark model ( nqm )",
    "the values of the spin polarizations are @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30    due to the homogeneity of the right hand side of ( [ moment ] ) , it is a question of definition if the dependence on the baryon multiplet is considered to be associated with the quark magnetic moment rather than with the spin polarization . in refs.@xcite and @xcite",
    "we have chosen to analyze the data by keeping the spin polarizations fixed throughout .    here",
    "we will analyze the opposite situation , where the spin polarization is instead assumed to vary with the baryon multiplet and the quark magnetic moments are the same for all multiplets .",
    "this scheme has the advantage of making the properties of the quarks static and environment independent .",
    "since the effective magnetic moment of a quark in the nqm has the form @xmath31 @xmath32 being the quark charge , this means that there is no dependence of the effective quark mass @xmath33 on @xmath9 .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that the same constituent quark masses can be used successfully to predict the baryon octet and decuplet masses with only a hyperfine splitting interaction in the hamiltonian .",
    "the disadvantage is that the spin structure varies from multiplet to multiplet .",
    "this variation of spin polarization with the isospin multiplet introduces an explicit su(3)@xmath34 symmetry breaking in the analysis , which is different from earlier symmetry breaking schemes and is evaluated from the measured baryon magnetic moments .",
    "a further merit of this interpretation , and the one that we are going to analyze here , is that the sum - rules governing the axial - vector form factors are better fulfilled in this scheme , although the errors are still somewhat large to definitely decide between either of the two ways of attributing the mass dependence effect .",
    "since we are going to allow for su(3 ) symmetry breaking in our analysis , we will use the experimental data including the symmetry breaking form factors @xmath8 whenever available .",
    "the spin structure parameters in the expressions for the magnetic moments and in the deep inelastic scattering experiments and axial - vector form factors are not a priori the same . in many models they are nevertheless proportional@xcite , and",
    "can be normalized to be the same .",
    "we normalize them to the axial - vector form factor @xmath35 , as is generally done .",
    "we write the baryon magnetic moments as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the magnetic moment of the quark of flavor @xmath12 and @xmath16 is the corresponding spin polarization .",
    "the factor @xmath38 is an overall factor , the same for all flavors , depending only on the isomultiplet @xmath9 .",
    "the flavor symmetry breaking within the isomultiplets is then accounted for by the quark magnetic moments that are free parameters .",
    "we stress that the value of @xmath38 is independent of the isospin symmetry breaking parameter @xmath39 discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus we can , if we like , assume that we have isospin symmetry .    in our previous analysis",
    "we associated the factor @xmath38 with the quark magnetic moments and defined @xmath40 as in equation ( [ moment ] ) .",
    "we can choose to normalize @xmath38 to @xmath41 , in which case @xmath42 .",
    "the other values of @xmath43 can then be obtained from the previously extracted values of the @xmath44 s as@xcite @xmath45 we will now instead associate @xmath38 with the spin polarizations .",
    "equation ( [ deltabi ] ) is then rewritten as @xmath46 thus , _",
    "e.g. _ in the mirror symmetric baryons @xmath21 , we instead have @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the values of @xmath38 can be well fitted to a linear function of the mean mass of @xmath9 as shown in fig .",
    "[ cool_plot ] .",
    "the linear relation is @xmath50 when @xmath51 is expressed in gev .",
    "we will continue to use @xmath52 in the following .",
    "we will test this linear relation in what follows by using the interpolated @xmath43 s from the equation above .",
    "these values are @xmath53 to illustrate why this @xmath9 dependent factor is needed we regard the sum - rule@xcite @xmath54 which follows when the quark magnetic moments and spin polarizations both are independent of @xmath9 .",
    "it is badly broken by the experimental data by ten standard deviations so that the left hand side is instead @xmath55 . in our more general parameterization",
    "this sum - rule becomes @xmath56 due to the construction of the @xmath43 s this sum - rule is satisfied .",
    "there is no doubt that the correction factors are needed .",
    "however , if a totally different structure is envisaged with more degrees of freedom , like pion - clouds etc .",
    "there is of course room for other possibilities .",
    "our aim is to investigate the symmetry - breaking in the more restricted framework of magnetic moments , spin polarizations , and axial - vector form factors , since these are extensively used to investigate baryon structure .",
    "whether we associate the @xmath38 factors to the quark magnetic moments or the spin polarizations , obviously does not affect the analysis of the magnetic moments .",
    "however , the analysis of the axial - vector form factors will be modified when we let the spin polarizations be given by ( [ nydeltabi ] ) .",
    "the axial - vector form factors can in this parameterization now be written @xmath57 this can be used to derive the two sum - rules @xmath58 as mentioned in the introduction , since @xmath59 is an su(3 ) breaking parameter , it would in our opinion be inconsistent to use @xmath60 s extracted from experimental data in the su(3 ) symmetric limit . in the rpp data table@xcite the values are effective values of the @xmath60 s in the su(3 ) symmetric limit where the induced axial vector form factors @xmath8 are taken to be zero .",
    "we want here to explore the consequence of taking the symmetry breaking into account through the @xmath8 s .",
    "the values of the @xmath60 s are in general sensitive to the values of the @xmath8s@xcite .",
    "for @xmath61 we use the value @xmath62 from hsueh _",
    "et al._@xcite and for @xmath63 the value @xmath64 from dworkin _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the value @xmath65 in rpp assumes that the induced form factor @xmath66 ( su(3 ) limit ) .",
    "the value measured by hsueh _",
    "is @xmath67 which is indeed far from zero .",
    "similarly , we use the value for @xmath68 from dworkin _ et al . _ because they have not assumed that the weak magnetism coupling @xmath69 .",
    "however , it would not make any significant difference to use the value @xmath70 given in the rpp data table .    for @xmath71 no value exists with @xmath72 , and",
    "therefore we take its value directly from the rpp data table .",
    "the two sum - rules are barely satisfied without the @xmath43 s .",
    "the relations are satisfied as follows @xmath73 corresponding to the two equations above .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are the values without the @xmath43 s ( i.e. @xmath74 ) .",
    "although the improvement relative to the case without the @xmath43 s might not be dramatic , both sum - rules are definitely better satisfied with the @xmath43 s .    as a further test",
    "we calculate the constant @xmath75 defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "this constant has the value @xmath76 from the magnetic moment data .",
    "our expression for this constant , expressed in terms of axial - vector form factors , is now @xmath77 this is again an improvement over the value @xmath78 found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the four axial - vector form factors can be parameterized by two variables , which we choose as @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath81 is by far the best measured parameter we will use this as a fix parameter and express the three other axial - vector form factors in terms of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this gives @xmath84    we have performed two least square fits of @xmath83 using these formulas and the experimental numbers quoted above , one with the @xmath43 s and one without . with the @xmath43 s we get @xmath85 with @xmath86 and without the @xmath43 s we get @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "we see that there is a considerable improvement when the @xmath43 s are included .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig.[cooler_plot ] .",
    "the left picture illustrates the fit to eqs .",
    "( [ anpassa1])-([anpassa3 ] ) , without the @xmath43 factors .",
    "the gray bands are the experimental values of the @xmath60 s including the errors .",
    "the linear functions are the corresponding right hand sides of ( [ anpassa1])-([anpassa3 ] ) .",
    "the thick central vertical line is the value for @xmath89 obtained in the fit , and the thinner vertical lines are the error bounds of the fit .",
    "the right picture similarly illustrates the fit when the @xmath43 s are included .",
    "we can see that all @xmath60 s are better accounted for when using the @xmath43 factors .",
    "the value @xmath90 differs rather much from the value @xmath91 used by ellis and karliner@xcite in their proton spin polarization analysis .",
    "the difference has two sources : the @xmath43 factors and the different choice of experimental data for the @xmath60 s .",
    "this shows , in our opinion , that there is a rather large uncertainty in the determination of the quark spin polarization of the nucleon , which involves the constant @xmath89 .",
    "the conventional wisdom is to use the experimental values with the assumption that @xmath66 for all @xmath60 s . using these values in eqs .",
    "( [ anpassa1])-([anpassa3 ] ) with @xmath92 leads to a value of @xmath93 .",
    "however , such an analysis ignores the experimental fact that @xmath72 for @xmath61 , making the determination uncertain . on the other hand ,",
    "in our analysis we have only set @xmath72 for one @xmath60 as the others are experimentally unknown .",
    "this obviously also leads to an uncertainty in the determination .",
    "there are basically three different ways that the data can be analyzed at present :    \\a ) we ignore the non - zero value of @xmath8 for @xmath61 and hope that there is no effect in the other form factors . in this case @xmath92 .",
    "\\b ) we include the correction @xmath8 for @xmath61 and hope that this correction is small for the other @xmath60 s .",
    "@xmath94    \\c ) we include the correction for @xmath8 that is measured , and hope that they are not too large for the unmeasured ones .",
    "we also include the phenomenological su(3 ) correction factors from the magnetic moment analysis .",
    "@xmath95    the option c ) is in our view essentially on the same level of rigor as the option a ) , which tries to ignore the problem entirely .",
    "we can not find that it is more consistent to try to ignore a problem that has been experimentally shown to exist , rather than to treat it , even if the treatment is incomplete , due to lack of data .",
    "our calculation has shown that the sum - rules for the @xmath60 s seem to be better accounted for using the approach c ) .",
    "this indicates that the corrections are important .",
    "we can also see that our approach is more consistent with the sum - rules if we calculate @xmath89 separately from eqs .",
    "( [ anpassa1])-([anpassa2 ] ) and ( [ anpassa3 ] ) .",
    "option a ) gives @xmath96 from ( [ anpassa1])-([anpassa2 ] ) and @xmath97 from ( [ anpassa3 ] ) .",
    "option c ) gives the values @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "these two values are certainly much closer to each other .",
    "the values of @xmath100 and @xmath89 are commonly used in analyses to determine the proton spin polarization .",
    "a change in the value of @xmath83 therefore has a non - negligible influence on such a spin polarization analysis .",
    "we will illustrate this using the formulas from the analysis of ellis and karliner@xcite .",
    "their evaluation of @xmath101 can be expressed as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are as in @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath82 has the usual value @xmath35 , but the constant @xmath83 has in ref.@xcite the value @xmath105 .",
    "the value of @xmath106 will change with the value of @xmath83 .",
    "let the change in @xmath83 be denoted @xmath107 , and the new value of @xmath106 be denoted @xmath108 .",
    "we then have @xmath109 the value of @xmath110 found above will thus lead to a different estimate of the total spin polarization of the proton .",
    "@xmath106 will change to @xmath111 in our previous analysis of isospin symmetry breaking in the baryon magnetic moments@xcite this value favors a slightly smaller isospin symmetry breaking than the value @xmath112 .",
    "it also changes slightly the quark spin content of the proton to the values @xmath113 calculated by means of @xmath108 , @xmath83 and @xmath82 .",
    "the main effect is to allow @xmath3 to be larger .",
    "as we have seen above there is support from the axial - vector form factor data , when @xmath8 is taken into account , that the spin polarizations of the quarks are diminishing with the increase of mass of the host particle .",
    "this mass dependence is born out in the sum - rules that can be written and are well satisfied by the experimental data .",
    "these mass dependent spin polarizations also account for the breaking of the sum - rule for the baryon magnetic moments .",
    "our analysis leads to a change in the evaluation of the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath89 , that will affect the proton spin polarization analysis .",
    "our value for the constant @xmath83 favors a lower value of the proton quark spin sum .",
    "the data for the axial - vector form factors used in the sum - rules are subject to statistical and systematic errors .",
    "there are essentially three form factor values used by us in these sum - rules , that are still uncertain .",
    "these are @xmath114 , @xmath61 , and @xmath68 .",
    "for the first one , which is a low statistics experiment ( 1992 events ) , the quoted error is the combined error .",
    "the two last ones are high statistics experiments . for the @xmath61 form factor the quoted error is probably dominated by the error in the determination of the induced form factor @xmath8 . for the @xmath68 form factor measured by dworkin et al , there might be a further systematic error @xmath115 to be added to the quoted error . if this is done the difference between the two fits in fig 2 .",
    "becomes somewhat less pronounced , but the main features remain .",
    "the final result for @xmath89 should of course therefore be taken with some caution and await further measurements of the other @xmath8 factors to be complete .",
    "however , it does , in our opinion , merit consideration and shows the uncertainty at present in the determination of @xmath89 , which has a non - negligible influence on the determination of the nucleon quark spin polarizations .",
    "the studies performed by leinweber _ et al._@xcite supports indirectly the findings here .",
    "their lattice gauge calculations have been done in quenched qcd , and to define the effective quark magnetic moments , the spin polarizations were set to their nqm values once the results were extracted from the lattice .",
    "the quark magnetic moments then show a decrease in value with increasing mass of the host particle , in much the same way as we found in ref.@xcite , where we also chose the keep the spin polarizations mass independent .",
    "as the total angular momentum of the proton is fixed to @xmath116 , this means that there must be a contribution from some other electrically neutral component that increases its angular momentum with baryon mass to compensate for the decrease in the contribution coming from the quarks .",
    "one possibility is to attribute such a contribution to the presence of gluonic components in the baryons .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the findings from deep inelastic scattering experiments , that only about half of the proton momentum is carried by the quarks .",
    "also a collective mode of the skyrmion type , with a rather small contribution to the magnetic moment , could be envisaged to manifest in this way .",
    "also lattice gauge calculations of the axial - vector form factors for the heavier states , would possibly shed light on the behavior found here .",
    "such calculations have already been performed for the nucleon system@xcite .",
