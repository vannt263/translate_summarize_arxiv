    "an actual analysis will probably be sensitive to the region @xmath195 and @xmath196 with non - uniform weight .",
    "the theoretical errors in such a case will be comparable to our results , as long as the weight function does not vary too rapidly .",
    "the formulae presented in the appendix are sufficient to determine the perturbative relationship of @xmath0 and such a measurement .",
    "in addition , as explained in @xcite , due to heavy quark symmetry , the @xmath197 background near @xmath198 may be easier to understand as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath20 than as a function of @xmath20 only .",
    "for example , the @xmath199 and higher mass states can not contribute for @xmath200 , and so the main background is @xmath201 near zero recoil , which will be precisely measured to determine @xmath194 .",
    "in this paper we proposed a precision determination of the magnitude of the ckm matrix element @xmath6 from charmless inclusive semileptonic @xmath1 decays using combined cuts on the dilepton invariant mass , @xmath23 , and the hadronic invariant mass , @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to the following general strategy for determining @xmath0 :    * make the cut on @xmath20 as large as possible , keeping the background from @xmath1 to charm under control * for a given cut on @xmath20 , reduce the @xmath23 cut as low as possible , keeping the contribution from the @xmath5 quark structure function , as well as the perturbative uncertainties , small ( see figs .  [ perturbative ] and [ sfig ] ) .",
    "we have calculated @xmath66 , the partially integrated rate in the presence of cuts on @xmath23 and @xmath20 ( normalized as in eq .",
    "( [ defineg ] ) ) .",
    "our results are summarized for three representative values of the cuts in table [ finaltable ] .",
    "the total uncertainty @xmath187 is twice the uncertainty in @xmath0 . the uncertainty from weak annihilation ( fig .  [ mcubed ] )",
    "may be reduced by comparing results in @xmath143 and @xmath202 decay , or by comparing the semileptonic widths of the @xmath153 and @xmath154 @xcite , while the remaining uncertainties could be reduced by an improved determination of the @xmath5 quark mass and a complete two loop calculation of the doubly differential rate @xmath203 .",
    "this method is sensitive to up to @xmath204 of the @xmath205 decays , about twice the fraction of events than in the case of the cut on @xmath23 alone .",
    "we found that a determination of @xmath0 with a theoretical error at the 510% level is possible .",
    "the combined @xmath176 cut also allows this precision to be obtained with cuts which are away from the threshold for @xmath26 , an important criterion for realistic detector resolution .",
    "such a measurement of @xmath0 would largely reduce the standard model range of @xmath206 , and thus allow more sensitive searches for new physics .",
