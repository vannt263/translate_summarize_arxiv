    "in recent years , higher dimensional black holes have become one of the major subjects in fundamental physics  @xcite .",
    "although recent ideas of braneworld and tev gravity  @xcite have opened up the possibility of ` large ' extra - dimensions , still important and widely believed especially in the context of string theories is the spacetime picture that our macroscopically large four - dimensional spacetime is realized from a higher dimensional spacetime by some mechanism of compactifying ( and stabilizing ) extra - dimensions within the size of the fundamental scale of gravity . in this context",
    ", it is of great interest to consider _ kaluza - klein black holes _ , which are essentially higher dimensional near the event horizon but look like four - dimensional with compactified small extra - dimensions , at large distances .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a new class of kaluza - klein black hole solutions , which are constructed by applying so called the _ squashing transformation _",
    "( described below ) to a known _ starting - point _ solution in five - dimensional theories .",
    "specifically , we consider the reissner - nordstm - gdel black hole solution of herdeiro  @xcite in five - dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theories , as our starting - point geometry .",
    "we `` squash '' it , thereby obtaining a new metric specified by 4 parameters .",
    "we then choose the parameters so that the resultant spacetime possesses two killing horizons . as a result ,",
    "our new solutions have the black hole event horizon whose cross - section geometry is of squashed @xmath0 , as well as an inner horizon , and are asymptotically locally flat with the structure of a twisted @xmath1 bundle over a four - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "it is remarkable to note that although our starting - point geometry  @xcite admits closed timelike curves as a consequence of gdel type rotation , our resultant new kaluza - klein solution itself exhibits no causal pathology outside the event horizon , thanks to the squashing transformation and appropriate choice of the parameters .",
    "our kaluza - klein black holes obtained in the way described above can also be viewed as a charged rotating black hole in the rotating gross - perry - sorkin ( gps ) monopole background  @xcite , which itself is obtained via the squashing transformation from the five - dimensional gdel universe in einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theories .",
    "therefore , in order to understand basic properties of our kaluza - klein solutions , it would be illuminating to discuss first the geometry and basic features of the rotating gps background solutions .",
    "we shall do so in the next section .",
    "but before proceeding subsequent sections and presenting our solutions , we would like to review briefly some related work .",
    "the first example of such kaluza - klein black holes was given as a vacuum solution to the five - dimensional einstein equation by dobiasch and maison  @xcite .",
    "it was then shown by gibbons and wiltshire  @xcite that the solution of dobiasch and maison asymptotes to a twisted @xmath1 bundle over the four - dimensional spacetime with a single rotation with respect to the extra fifth - dimension .",
    "( see e.g. , rasheed  @xcite for further generalization of the dobiasch and maison solution  @xcite . )",
    "a recent key work along this line is that of ishihara and matsuno  @xcite , who have found static charged kaluza - klein black hole solutions in the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory by using , for the first time , the squashing technique .",
    "namely , they view the base manifold @xmath0 of a five - dimensional reissner - nordstm black hole as a fiber bundle over @xmath2 with fiber @xmath1 and then consider a deformation that changes the ratio of the radius of @xmath2 to that of @xmath1 fiber .",
    "subsequently the ishihara - matsuno solution was generalized to many different cases .",
    "for example , a static multi kaluza - klein black hole solution  @xcite was constructed immediately from the ishihara - matsuno solution .",
    "the squashing transformation of ishihara - matsuno  @xcite , which we will also employ in this paper , has been then recognized as a type of powerful solution generating technique .",
    "in fact , it was demonstrated by wang  @xcite that the five - dimensional kaluza - klein black hole of dobiasch and maison can be reproduced by squashing a five - dimensional myers - perry black hole with two equal angular momenta .",
    "the application of the squashing transformation to non - asymptotically flat kerr - gdel black hole solutions  @xcite was considered in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the squashing transformation was applied to the cvetic _",
    "et al _ s charged rotating black hole solution  @xcite with two equal angular momenta .",
    "these solutions @xcite correspond to a generalization of the ishihara - matsuno solution to the rotating black holes in einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theories .",
    "a similar type of kaluza - klein black holes was considered in the context of supersymmetric theories by gaiotto _",
    "@xcite and elvang _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "kaluza - klein black holes which asymptote to the direct product of the four - dimensional minkowski space - time and @xmath1 were discussed by  @xcite .",
    "further generalizations of kaluza - klein solutions of this type and their basic properties have been studied by many authors  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "as mentioned above , we will review the five dimensional gdel universe and the rotating gps monopole based on the results of the paper  @xcite .",
    "then , in section [ sec : solution ] , we present our new stationary charged kaluza - klein black hole solutions in the rotating gps monopole background . in section [ sec : case ] , we examine our solutions under several special choices of the parameters and study their basic properties .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and discussions . in appendix",
    "we show that our background , rotating gps monopole geometry is a supersymmetric solution .",
    "we shall briefly review the results of  @xcite concerning the _ rotating gross - perry - sorkin ( gps ) monopole _ , which is one of the simplest solutions in five - dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theories .",
    "we begin with the five - dimensional gdel universe since the rotating gps monopole solutions are obtained by applying the squashing transformation to the five - dimensional supersymmetric gdel universe .",
    "we then discuss some basic properties of the rotating gps monopole , in particular , its asymptotic structure and the existence of an ergoregion .",

    "however , it would not appear to be straightforward to specify possible parameter region for which ctcs cease to exist outside the black hole horizon of this solution . ]    in the ishihara - matsuno solution  @xcite , the @xmath145 case corresponds to a supersymmetric solution , i.e. , the static black hole on taub - nut space  @xcite . however , in the rotating ishihara - matsuno solution  @xcite , the two cases , @xmath196 and @xmath197 , describe different solutions due to the existence of a chern - simons term . only the case of @xmath196 corresponds to a supersymmetric kaluza - klein black hole solution of gaiotto _ et al _  @xcite . in our solution , neither the case @xmath196 nor the case @xmath197 , is supersymmetric and the two horizons do not degenerate . for either @xmath198 or @xmath199 ,",
    "the outer and inner horizons degenerate , but in either case our solution is non - supersymmetric .    finally we would like to make two comments on the squashing transformation .",
    "first , we recall that our starting - point geometry ( either the reissner - nordstm - gdel black hole solution or the five - dimensional gdel universe ) suffers from causality violation , but nevertheless our resulting solutions do not . in view of this",
    ", we can anticipate that the squashing transformation may be used to generate much larger variety of physically interesting solutions , starting not only from physically sensible geometries ( e.g. , those of asymptotically flat , with no ctcs , etc ) but even from various causally or metrically _ pathological _ geometries such as spacetimes with ctcs and/or naked singularities .",
    "second , as far as the present authors know , the squashing transformation has so far been applied only to cohomogeneity - one black hole solutions such as five - dimensional myers - perry black hole solutions with two equal angular momenta and the cvetic - lu - pop s charged black hole solutions with two equal angular momenta .",
    "it would be interesting to consider a generalization of the squashing technique so that it would apply to cohomogeneity - two spacetimes such as black ring  @xcite , black holes with two rotations  @xcite , black lens  @xcite , or even wider class of spacetimes .",

    "this research was supported in part by the japan society for the promotion of science and in part by perimeter institute for theoretical physics .",
    "here we show that our background rotating gps monopole solution is supersymmetric , using the results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we first recall that according to @xcite , all supersymmetric solutions of the five - dimensional minimal supergravity have a non - spacelike killing vector field , and when the killing vector field @xmath200 is timelike , the metric and the gauge potential are given , respectively , by @xmath201 \\",
    ", ,   \\label{eq : susy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath202 is a metric of a hyper - khler space @xmath203 .",
    "the scalar function @xmath153 , one - forms @xmath204 and @xmath205 on @xmath203 are given by @xmath206 here , @xmath207 is the laplacian on @xmath203 and the two - form @xmath208 is the self - dual part of the one - form @xmath209 , given by @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 is the hodge dual operator on @xmath203 .",
    "since @xmath200 is a killing vector field associated with time translation , all components are independent of the time coordinate @xmath213 .",
    "we now show that the rotating gps monopole solution takes the form ( [ eq : susy])-([eq : susy3 ] ) . comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : gps ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : susy ] ) , we can read off the correspondence of these two metrics as follows @xmath214 @xmath215 with @xmath216 where @xmath202 is the metric of the euclidean self - dual taub - nut space and @xmath217 is a harmonic function on the three - dimensional euclid space @xmath218 . note that @xmath219 .",
    "so the exterior derivative of the one - form @xmath220 can be written as @xmath221 then the dual of the one - form @xmath222 is obtained as @xmath223 as a result , we find @xmath224 the second equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : susy2 ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "the first equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : susy2 ] ) becomes @xmath225 and obviously , @xmath226 solves this equation .",
    "the third equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : susy2 ] ) yields @xmath227 .",
    "hence the one - form @xmath228 takes a closed form at least locally , i.e. , there exists some function @xmath229 such that @xmath230 .",
    "we can set the function @xmath231 to zero by the gauge transformation .",
    "thus the rotating gps monopole solution ( [ eq : gps])-([eq : gpsa ] ) is supersymmetric .",
