    "the numerical renormalization group method,@xcite originally developed@xcite by wilson for the kondo model and subsequently applied to a variety of impurity models with fermionic baths , was generalized in refs .",
    "to the case of bosonic baths with an eye towards dissipative impurity models .",
    "in particular , it has been applied to the spin - boson model,@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the local impurity states with bias @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the tunneling rate , and the @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the frequencies and coupling constants of the bath oscillators .",
    "the bath is completely specified by its propagator at the `` impurity '' location @xmath7 whose spectral density @xmath8 is commonly parameterized as @xmath9 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath10 characterizes the dissipation strength , and @xmath11 is a cutoff energy .",
    "the value @xmath12 represents the case of ohmic dissipation . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the spin - boson model displays a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a delocalized and a localized phase , reached for small and large @xmath10 , respectively.@xcite    nrg has enabled detailed investigations of this qpt . while statistical - mechanics arguments@xcite suggest that this transition is in the same universality class as the thermal phase transition of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) ising model with @xmath14 long - range interactions , initial nrg results@xcite were in disagreement with this quantum - to - classical correspondence ( qcc ) .",
    "in particular , nrg delivered @xmath15-dependent critical exponents which obeyed hyperscaling for all @xmath16 .",
    "those exponents agreed with the ones of the ising model for @xmath17 , but disagreed for @xmath0 where the ising model is above its upper - critical dimension and displays mean - field behavior without hyperscaling.@xcite this apparent violation of qcc prompted further numerical investigations .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite and exact - diagonalization@xcite studies led to the opposite conclusion , namely that the critical behavior of the spin - boson model for @xmath0 is classical and of mean - field type .",
    "meanwhile , two different errors of the nrg method have been identified,@xcite which can be held responsible for incorrect results regarding critical properties .",
    "these two errors are the hilbert - space truncation error , arising from the fact that the infinite hilbert space of each bath harmonic oscillator needs to be truncated to @xmath18 local states , and the mass - flow error , which is rooted in the iterative diagonalization procedure of nrg and leads to an effective shift of model parameters along the nrg run .",
    "the mass - flow error has been discussed in some detail in ref .   where it has been shown to give rise to an incorrect exponent @xmath19 , describing the thermal divergence of the susceptibility at criticality .",
    "ref .   also implemented a recipe to correct the mass - flow error which then allowed to recover the mean - field value @xmath20 for @xmath0 .",
    "the problem of hilbert - space truncation has been solved in ref .",
    ", by employing an optimized boson basis within a variational matrix - product - state approach on the wilson chain",
    ". applied to the spin - boson model with @xmath0 , this method not only delivered the expected mean - field values for the order - parameter exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 if the variational bosonic hilbert space is taken to be ( effectively ) infinite , but also showed that artificially restricting the hilbert space causes a crossover at small energies to the erroneous non - mean - field behavior of nrg .    the shortcomings of nrg have independently become clear in studies of dissipative anharmonic - oscillator models : these models are in one - to - one correspondence with a 1d ising @xmath23 theory with @xmath14 interactions and must therefore display a mean - field transition for @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , standard nrg delivered@xcite the same non - mean - field exponents as for the spin - boson model .    together",
    ", these developments show that the initial nrg results@xcite were incorrect and that the qcc is fulfilled for the sub - ohmic spin - boson model .",
    "however , it has remained a puzzle _ why and how _ the nrg could produce an internally consistent set of exponents which moreover obeyed hyperscaling .",
    "this question is of obvious relevance for further applications of nrg .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to close this gap .",
    "we discuss hilbert - space truncation in some detail , showing that the combination of hilbert - space truncation and mass flows acts like a non - analytic term in the landau expansion of the free energy . at criticality , this in turn forces the system to effectively remain locked at the upper - critical dimension for all @xmath24 . as a result , a set of `` trivial '' exponents with hyperscaling properties",
    "is obtained . while hilbert - space truncation and mass flow may be thought of as independent sources of error , their effects",
    "are intertwined : as we argue below , the non - analytic term in the landau expansion can be understood in terms of a _ truncated mass flow_.    we note that recent papers@xcite insist on the breakdown of qcc for the spin - boson model",
    ". however , the concrete numerical results obtained in refs .   are fully consistent with the scenario proposed here , as will be discussed below . moreover , the objections raised against qcc in ref",
    ".   do not apply .",
    "hence , we believe the interpretation given in refs .",
    "is incorrect .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : landau ] summarizes the spin - boson model , together with the standard derivation of its qcc via a feynman path integral .",
    "it then reviews the properties of the resulting @xmath23 theory  whose language will be heavily used in the paper  in particular the mean - field regime of @xmath0 where landau theory applies .",

    "it will highlight the crossover scales induced by the truncation and their influence on physical observables . a general discussion of nrg and its applicability to mean - field critical phenomena closes the paper .",
    "on general grounds , one expects that the quantum phase transition in the spin - boson model can be described by a field theory for an ising ( i.e. real scalar ) order parameter @xmath25 , where @xmath26 corresponds to the local magnetization @xmath27 .        at this stage , one may decide to interpret the @xmath46 ( for fixed finite @xmath47 ) as discrete spins , which form an ising chain with long - range interactions .",

    "an increase of the ( bare ) mass parameter @xmath55 corresponds to a decrease in the dissipation strength @xmath10 , with the critical point located at @xmath56 or @xmath57 .    by universality arguments , the same field theory describes a dissipative anharmonic oscillator @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the bare `` impurity '' oscillator frequency , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 parameterizes the anharmonicity . for @xmath62 ,",

    "the field theory can be utilized to calculate critical exponents , with the following definitions : @xmath67 \\label{exponents } \\\\[-1.75ex ] \\phi(\\alpha=\\alpha_c , t=0 ) & \\propto & | \\epsilon |^{1/\\delta } , \\nonumber\\\\ \\chi(\\alpha=\\alpha_c , t ) & \\propto & t^{-x } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "consequently , the transition is controlled by a gaussian fixed point for @xmath0 , with critical exponents @xmath72 where the @xmath15 dependence of the correlation - length exponent @xmath73 reflects the influence of the long - range interactions . moreover , the exponents @xmath19 and @xmath74 , related to the finite - size - scaling and anomalous decay exponents of the classical ising model , are different : @xmath75 in contrast , for @xmath17 the exponents take non - trivial values .",

    "i.e. , for @xmath17 , naive scaling applies .",
    "given the zero - temperature form of the critical propagator @xmath79 , the interaction - induced mass at criticality has to scale as @xmath80 , which yields @xmath81 as stated above .",

    "the calculation shows that it is mandatory to include the mass self - consistently into the internal propagator of the tadpole diagram ; this is different from the situation in @xmath23 theories with short - ranged interactions where the tadpole diagram with bare propagator would be sufficient to determine the shift exponent .",

    "in the remainder of the paper , we discuss the errors of the bosonic nrg and the consequences of eq .   in detail .",
    "the mass - flow problem of the bosonic nrg has been investigated in ref .  .",
    "here we shall summarize the discussion and also provide an analysis of certain subleading corrections .    within the nrg algorithm ,",

    "the `` missing '' sites imply a missing contribution to the real part of the bath propagator .",
    "as detailed in ref .  , the zero - frequency value of this missing real part , @xmath124 , scales as @xmath125 for a power - law bath spectrum , eq .  .",
    "in the field - theory language , the missing real part implies a temperature - dependent variation of the order - parameter mass .",

    "7b and 8b of ref .  ) .",
    "ref .   claimed that this would reflect an underlying temperature power law with exponent smaller than @xmath159 , then supposedly inconsistent with mean - field behavior .",
    "here we argue instead that the downward - deviation can be straightforwardly understood in terms of the mass flow and its compensation . as explained in ref .  , the mass - flow correction term with fixed @xmath152 only compensates for the mass flow near a specific fixed point , and different fixed points would require different @xmath152 . in other words ,",
    "if the proper @xmath160 for the low - temperature fixed point has been chosen , then this will compensate the artificial mass only to leading order , but a subleading term will be left over . for the spin - boson model , one can easily understand the sign of the subleading term by noting that nrg@xmath155 produces an overcompensation of the mass flow at elevated temperatures or energies : at high energies , @xmath151 influences the mass very little ( note that it couples to @xmath161 in eq .   in the short - time limit ) .",
    "then , at high energies , only the mass - flow correction is active , which leads to a downward correction of the mass .",

    "( ii ) the incorrect zero - temperature exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 arise because the chain is effectively truncated at some magnetization - dependent @xmath173 where the diverging oscillator shifts can no longer be accomodated within the finite hilbert space for each boson site . in the order - parameter field theory , ( i ) and",

    "the fact that the resulting nrg exponents are internally consistent and obey hyperscaling can be rationalized by realizing that both errors of bosonic nrg can be associated with _ stationarity _ along the nrg flow .",

    "thus , both errors force the nrg flow to show fixed - point behavior  in the nrg sense of stationarity of the many - body energies and states along the flow  in a situation where the correct physical rg flow does not show stationarity in the same sense .",
    "this applies both to the localized phase of the spin - boson model , where the boson number diverges along the wilson chain , and to the flow towards the gaussian critical point , where the true many - body level spacing goes to zero as @xmath92 because of the irrelevance of the quartic interaction.@xcite    this finally solves the puzzle : nrg produces incorrect exponents obeying hyperscaling because its algorithmic deficiences force the nrg flow to be stationary , which implies naive scaling .",
    "one concludes that it is difficult with traditional nrg to describe critical phenomena which violate hyperscaling and are controlled by a dangerously irrelevant variable because in such a case the nrg flow will not be stationary near the physical rg fixed point@xcite  this has been ( partially ) illustrated in ref .  .",
