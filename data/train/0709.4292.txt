    "quantum theory opens up new possibilities for information processing and communication and the entanglement of a quantum state allows to carry out tasks , which could not be possible with a classical system @xcite .",
    "it plays a pivotal role for exponential speedup of quantum algorithms @xcite , teleportation @xcite and superdense coding @xcite .",
    "the quantum correlation is the essence of the entanglement and it can not be created by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) alone .",
    "analysis of multi - particle entanglement provides insight into the nature of quantum correlation . however , current situation is far from satisfaction .",
    "linden _ et al .",
    "_ revealed that almost every pure state of three qubits is completely determined by its two - particle reduced density matrices @xcite .",
    "in other words , we can not get much new information from the given pure three - qubit state if the reduced two - qubit states are known .",
    "the case of pure states of any number @xmath0 of parties was considered in ref.@xcite and it was shown that the reduced states of a fraction of the parties uniquely specify the quantum state .",
    "one may consider more general and open questions of vital importance : how much information is contained in any reduced @xmath1-qubit state ? how do we use this information to convert the _ nonlinear eigenproblem _ of entanglement measure calculation to the _ linear eigenproblem _ ?",
    "is there any physically relevant connection between the pure @xmath0-party states which have lu - equivalent @xmath1-party reduced states ? does such a connection impose an upper bound for entanglement measure ?",
    "groverian entanglement measure @xmath2 @xcite gives concise answers to all these questions .",
    "it is an entanglement measure defined in operational terms , namely , how well a given state serves as the input to grover s search algorithm @xcite .",
    "groverian measure depends on maximal success probability @xmath3 and is defined by the formula @xmath4 .",
    "the maximal success probability is the overlap of a given state with the nearest separable state .",
    "the same overlap defines geometric measure of entanglement introduced earlier as an axiomatic measure@xcite .",
    "in this view groverian measure gives an operational treatment of the axiomatic measure and is a good tool to investigate the above - mentioned questions . in the following",
    "we will consider only the maximal success probability and our conclusions are valid for both groverian and geometric measures .",
    "surprisingly enough , any reduced state resulting from a partial trace over a single qubit suffices to find @xmath3 of the original pure state .",
    "for example , the entanglement of three - qubit pure state is completely understood from the two - qubit mixed state reduced from the original pure state .",
    "since bipartite systems , regardless mixed or pure , always give a linear eigenproblem , this fact enables us to obtain analytic expressions of groverian entanglement measures for pure three qubit states .",
    "it is well - known that entanglement measures are invariant under local unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "however , lu - equivalent condition is not the only one for the same groverian entanglement measure .",
    "in fact , if two pure states have lu - equivalent reduced states which are obtained by taking partial trace once , it turns out that they have same entanglement measures . owing to this the lower bound for @xmath3",
    "is derived .",
    "however , it is not reachable for three and higher qubit states and , therefore , is not precise .    in section",
    "ii we derive a formula connecting groverian measure of a pure state and its reduced density matrix . in section iii",
    "we establish a lower bound for groverian measure . in section iv we present analytic expressions for the maximal success probability that reflect main features of both measures . in section",
    "v we make concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a pure @xmath0-qudit state @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum probability of success is defined by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 s are pure single qudit normalized states .",
    "our intention is to derive a formula which connects the maximum probability of success and @xmath1-qudit reduced states . in general , reduced states",
    "are mixed states and are described by density matrices .",
    "hence we express the maximum probability of success in terms of density operators right away .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath8 for the state @xmath5 and @xmath9 for the pure single qudit state density operators , respectively .",
    "eq.([gen.pmaxpsi ] ) takes the form    @xmath10    * theorem 1 . *",
    "_ any @xmath1-qudit reduced state uniquely determines the groverian and geometric measures of the original @xmath0-qudit pure state .",
    "_    * proof .",
    "* @xcite define a single qudit state @xmath11 by the formula    @xmath12 means exclusion .",
    "obviously    @xmath13 is maximum when @xmath14 and therefore @xmath15    denote by @xmath16 the reduced state resulting from a partial trace over @xmath17-th qudit , that is @xmath18 . from this definition",
    "it follows the identity    @xmath19    owing to this identity eq.([ref-2 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath20    both sides of the eq.([unit ] ) must have the same maximum and this is the proof of the theorem .    since the r.h.s . of eq.([unit ] ) contains the reduced density operator @xmath21 which is generally mixed state , the next maximization is nontrivial .",
    "eq.([unit ] ) does not mean that a pure state and its once reduced state have equal groverian measures .",
    "one can not maximize the mixed state density matrix over product states to find the entanglement measure because the resulting measure is not an entanglement monotone@xcite .",
    "eq.([unit ] ) connects directly the maximum probability of success with the reduced density operator    @xmath22    in fact , theorem1 is true for any entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "consider an ( n-1)-qudit reduced density matrix that can be purified by a single qudit reference system .",
    "let @xmath23 be any joint pure state .",
    "all other purifications can be obtained from the state @xmath23 by lu - transformations @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a local unitary matrix acting on single qudit and @xmath26 is a unit matrix . since any entanglement measure must be invariant under lu - transformations , it must be the same for all purifications independently of @xmath25 .",
    "hence the reduced density matrix @xmath8 determines any entanglement measure on the initial pure state .",
    "however , there is a crucial difference . in the case of groverian measure",
    "the proof expresses entanglement measure by the reduced density matrix directly . as will be explained in section iv , eq.([reduced",
    "] ) is a simple and effective tool for calculating three - qubit entanglement measure .",
    "no such formula is known for other measures and general proof for other measures has limited practical significance",

    "the scalar product of two real vectors with the constant modules is maximal when vectors are parallel .",

    "an arbitrary density matrix @xmath9 for a pure state qubit may be written as @xmath47 , where and @xmath42 is a unit real vector",
    ". then eq.([start ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath48    from eq.([maximum ] ) it follows that    @xmath49    we define @xmath41 matrix @xmath50 by formula    @xmath51    where trace is taken over ( 1,2, ... ,n-2)-qubits .",

    "we use this prescription @xmath56 times , eliminate all single qubit density operators step by step from eq.([reduced ] ) and obtain    @xmath57    note that this lower bound is valid only for pure states .",
    "the question at issue is whether it is a precise limit or not . and",
    "if it is indeed the case , then what are the pure states which have the lower bound of @xmath3 ?",
    "we will prove that this lower bound is reached only for bipartite states .",

    ". one can continue this chain of derivations by induction . indeed , suppose all @xmath75-qubit states @xmath76 are completely mixed . then @xmath77-qubit density matrices @xmath78 must have the form    @xmath79    where    @xmath80    from eq.([pure - red ] ) it follows that @xmath81 takes its minimal value if @xmath82 .",
    "eq.([induc ] ) is consistent with this condition if and only if the maximization of the term of @xmath83 yields zero .",

    "eq.([reduced ] ) allows to calculate the maximal success probability for three qubit states which are expressed as linear combinations of four given orthogonal product states @xcite .",
    "the answer is more complicated than a simple formula , but each final expression of the measure has its own meaningful interpretation .",
    "namely , @xmath3 can take the following values(up to numerical coefficients ) :    * the square of the circumradius of the cyclic polygon formed by coefficients of the state function , * the square of the circumradius of the crossed figure formed by coefficients of the state function , * the largest coefficient .",

    "although the above picture seems simple , the separation of the applicable domains is highly nontrivial task . to make clear which of expressions should be applied for a given state we refer to @xcite .",
    "all our results on groverian measure of three qubit pure states are summarized in @xcite .",
    "eq.([reduced ] ) gives nonlinear eigenvalue problem for four and higher qubit states and it is natural to ask whether there is an extension of eq.([reduced ] ) that allows to find analytic results for four , five , or general n - qubits .",
    "although we have no distinct results here , but we have obtained some insight from the analysis of the information contained in one and two qubit reduced states . probably , it is possible to express the maximal success probability in terms of one and two qubit reduced states in case of four qubit pure states . such formula , if it can be derived , will give linear equations for four qubit pure states .",
    "however , situation is opposite in the case of five qubit states . the method does now allow to convert the task to the linear eigenvalue problem and more powerful tools",
    "are needed to calculate maximal success probability of general n - qubit states .",
