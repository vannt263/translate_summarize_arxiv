    "let us consider the implications of it being energetically favorable for a vortex to pass through the film , and have its flux trapped in the insulating layer .",
    "once the flux is trapped in this way , it is non - dissipative under rf fields ( unlike a vortex , which has a normal conducting core ) .",

    "the highest @xmath1 occurs when the film is so thick that it approximates a bulk superconductor .",

    "assuming that the insulating layers are very thin ( this is optimal , as will be shown later ) , then as eqn [ eq : bi ] shows , if @xmath36 , then the force due to @xmath23 is the same no matter how thick the film is .",
    "however , there are two image antivortices contributing to @xmath24 : one for the external boundary , and one for the boundary at the insulating layer . for a thin film",
    ", the image antivortex at the insulating layer will have a significant attractive force , pulling the vortex into the film . since this is the only change in the forces on the vortex as the film thickness changes",
    ", a homolaminate will only have its @xmath1 decrease as the film becomes significantly smaller than a bulk .",
    "note that this same logic applies no matter how many times the superconductor is divided  a homolaminate sis multilayer with many thin film layers",
    "will still experience a reduced @xmath1 .",
    "only one curve in figure [ fig : bshvsdmulti ] is a homolaminate ; the rest are heterolaminates , in which the film material is different than the bulk . for a very thin heterolaminate",
    ", the film does not provide much screening for the bulk , and @xmath21 reaches the bulk s @xmath1 before the thin film barrier disappears .",
    "a very thick film behaves as a bulk , and reaches that material s bulk @xmath1 while @xmath21 is still relatively small .",
    "however , there is a small range of film thicknesses where the film and the bulk can simultaneously be close to their respective @xmath1 . in this case , the @xmath1 of the sis structures is somewhat higher than the bulk value of the film material , but the potential gain in @xmath1 is relatively small , and the gain decreases as the thickness of the insulating layer increases .",
    "the @xmath1 gain can be explained with a rough argument invoking the superfluid velocity @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the effective cooper pair mass and charge , @xmath41 is the magnetic vector potential , and @xmath42 is the gradient in the phase of the order parameter . if the superconductor is in the meissner state , @xmath43 and the magnitude of @xmath41 can be approximated by @xmath44 , where the integration starts deep in the bulk superconductor where @xmath45 and proceeds outwards .",
    "if the bulk superconductor is a material with a relatively small @xmath5 , such as niobium , then at the film @xmath46 and therefore @xmath37 will be smaller than if the bulk material were a large-@xmath5 material , such as the alternative materials under consideration .",
    "as a result , the superconductors in the sis structure are relatively `` unstressed , '' and can screen a larger external field .",
    "this same argument explains why it is optimal for @xmath19 to be as small as possible  this keeps @xmath46 as small as possible .",
    "however , the gain in @xmath1 can not be multiplied by adding more films of the same material . as with the homolaminate , @xmath23 ( and the vector potential ) will be unchanged by splitting up the superconducting film into separate layers with thin insulators between them , but @xmath24 will have a stronger influence on the vortex , pulling it into the film .",
    "this detrimental effect is visible in the last line of figure [ fig : bshvsdmulti ] , showing the calculation for a series of 5 nb@xmath11sn films , each with thickness @xmath47 , on a nb bulk , with thin insulating films between the superconductors .",
    "note that for the material parameters used , which came from experimental references , the theoretical superheating fields of nbn and mgb@xmath6 are smaller than that of nb . in this study",
    ", calculations were not performed for the ss structure , a superconducting film deposited directly onto a different superconductor , without an insulating layer .",
    "the calculation would be significantly more difficult , but such a structure may offer a stronger performance improvement for appropriate choices of the thickness of the film layer and the superconducting materials .",
    "gurevich states @xcite that `` thin film coating significantly decreases vortex dissipation at @xmath48 , '' where @xmath49 is the vortex penetration field .",
    "this raises the question of whether it might be possible to use a sis structure above @xmath49 , in a regime in which vortices pass through the film each half cycle , bringing trapped flux into and out of the insulating region .",
    "gurevich gives an expression for the power dissipated per area : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "consider a @xmath52 nm nb@xmath11sn film in a sis structure with a nb@xmath11sn bulk and a very thin insulator , exposed to a field @xmath20 that is 1 mt higher than the film s @xmath1 . in this case , @xmath53 w/@xmath54 .",
    "for a single cell tesla cavity , even this very small excess over @xmath1 generates approximately 4 kw of heat , far too much to be feasible for srf applications .",
    "[ eq : pdiss ] shows , the power dissipated by vortex penetration is proportional to frequency . for low frequency ac and dc applications ,",
    "vortex penetration could be tolerated . in this case ,",
    "sis structures may offer a distinct advantage .",
    "[ eq : vs ] shows , the superfluid velocity , a measure of the `` stress '' in a superconductor , is reduced in a large @xmath46 field by a gradient in the phase of the order parameter @xmath55 . even though the @xmath46 field at the film is tied to that of the bulk ( since the @xmath46 field is continuous across the insulating gap ) , the insulating gap does allow the opportunity to decouple @xmath55 in the film from that in the bulk .",
    "this is accomplished by passing vortex lines through the superconducting film , which would incur large dissipation at high frequencies , but is permissable at low frequencies . with several layers , and an appropriate @xmath55 maintained in each of them to compensate for the @xmath46 field",
    ", it should be possible to screen even very large fields while maintaining a relatively small @xmath37 in each of the layers , so that they remain in the meissner state .",
    "the primary motivation for trying to fabricate sis structures was the promise of enhancing the @xmath0 of low-@xmath4 alternative materials .",
    "it was suggested that above @xmath0 , dissipation would occur due to vortex dissipation @xcite .",
    "there was some experimental data supporting this idea , as nb@xmath11sn cavities coated by wuppertal researchers showed increasing surface resistance with field , an effect that onset near the @xmath0 of nb@xmath11sn @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , it was not clear if this performance degradation was fundamental and potentially related to vortex dissipation or if it was related to some other loss mechanism that could be ameliorated .",
    "this year , a nb@xmath11sn cavity was coated and tested at cornell . vertical test data and fits to material parameters show that the cavity clearly exceeds @xmath0 without a signficant increase in surface resistance @xcite@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 value calculated from the material parameters was confirmed by @xmath56-sr measurements on a witness sample @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a niobium cavity was prepared and tested at cornell after receiving a furnace treatment that gave it a very small mean free path .",
    "as a result , the niobium had a very small @xmath4 , similar to that of the alternative materials under consideration .",
    "it too had a performance with minimal increase in surface resistance , reaching fields significantly higher than the @xmath0 value determined from fits to material parameters @xcite@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that contrary to suggestions that sis structures enhance @xmath0 , in fact they reduce it to zero .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the @xmath1 of an sis structure is only marginally larger than the bulk value and only for a small parameter space , and that using a multilayer only decreases @xmath1 of the film .",
    "it was also shown that sis structures exhibit unmanageable levels of heating above @xmath1 at high frequencies .",
    "therefore , it seems that sis structures are not beneficial for srf applications",
