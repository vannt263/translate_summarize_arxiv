    "polar - ring galaxies ( prgs ) are unusual objects , typically composed of an early - type ( e or s0 ) host galaxy , with a ring of material ( stars , gas , and dust ) orbiting in a plane roughly perpendicular to the major axis of the host galaxy . as such",
    ", they are clear examples of galaxy interactions and tidal accrection events . the first major study of the class of prgs was that of whitmore et al .",
    "this paper presented data on @xmath3100 objects , only 6 of which were kinematically confirmed prgs .",
    "subsequent work has expanded this to a total of eleven objects ( combes et al .",
    "1992 ; arnaboldi et al .",
    "1993 ; reshetnikov & combes 1994 ; cox et al .  1995",
    "; hagen - thorn & reshetnikov 1996 ) .",
    "whitmore et al .",
    "( 1990 ) provides a good general overview of the properties of prgs .",
    "the host galaxies are typically gas - poor systems , while the rings are gas - rich ( richter , sackett & sparke 1994 ) , blue ( reshetnikov & combes 1994 ) , and dusty ( schweizer , whitmore & rubin 1983 ) .",
    "prgs also tend to be much more luminous in the far infrared ( fir ) than typical early - type galaxies ( richter et al .",
    "based on the  masses , and optical colors of polar rings , the typical model for the ring donor is a tidally accreted dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxy .",
    "other possible donors are the outer parts of spiral galaxies , and primordial  gas clouds .",
    "there are three models that have been suggested to explain the apparent stability of polar rings .",
    "the first of these is due to schweizer et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , who argue that polar rings are _ not _ stable , but can have very long decay times .",
    "they conclude that the timescale for the differential precession of the ring is on the order of a hubble time for orbits sufficiently near the pole , but very short for orbits inclined by less than @xmath370@xmath4 .",
    "the second model , discussed by a number of groups ( e.g.  dubinski & christoudoulou 1994 ; arnaboldi & sparke 1994 ; sackett & sparke 1990 ) , is that the rings are massive , self - gravitating structures that create stable polar orbits for themselves by deforming the potential of the host .",
    "the third model is that polar rings form in natural ` islands of stability ' : polar orbits may be inherently stable if the host potential is oblate - triaxial , as suggested by katz & rix ( 1992 ) and steiman - cameron & durisen ( 1988 ) .",
    "a great deal of recent work on prgs has focussed on their use as probes of the extent and shape of the dark matter halos of their host galaxies .",
    "these studies interpret the kinematics of prgs in terms of dynamical models , and thus assume prgs to be at least quasi - equilibrium systems . on the whole , this work indicates prgs to have very large mass - to - light ratios ( e.g.  reshetnikov & combes 1994 ) , and substantially flattened dark matter halos ( e.g.  sackett et al .  1994 and references therein ) . in a recent paper , combes & arnaboldi ( 1996 ) argue that the kinematic data for ngc 4650a can be fit by a model in which the dark matter is distributed following the polar - ring isophotes ( and _ not _ the host galaxy ) .",
    "this is , in a sense , the extreme case of a self - gravitating model .",
    "the fundamental questions regarding polar rings are as follows : how do the rings form ?",
    "once formed , how long do they last ?",
    "one way of addressing these questions is to obtain abundance information on polar rings .",
    "all plausible candidates for the ring donors are low - abundance objects ( @xmath5 solar ) . for",
    "the rings to have high abundances would indicate that either our notions of ring formation are wrong , or that polar rings are long - lived , stable , self - gravitating structures .",
    "they must not only survive long enough to undergo the star - formation episodes required for self - enrichment , they must also be massive enough to retain their enriched ejecta . as",
    "polar rings typically have numerous  regions , the easiest method to directly probe their abundances is nebular spectrophotometry of those  regions .",
    "we have obtained such data for the prototype prg ngc 2685 , and we report our results in this paper . in ",
    "2 we provide background on ngc 2685 . in ",
    "3 we describe our data set and reduction techniques .",
    "our abundance analysis is presented in  4 .",
    "we discuss our results for ngc 2685 , and the possible implications for prgs as a class in  5 , and present a summary , along with our plans for continuing this project in  6 .",
    "ngc 2685 ( arp 336 , also known as `` the helix galaxy '' and `` the spindle '' ) has long been known to be an unusual galaxy ( sandage 1961 ) .",
    "it is one of the two nearest prgs ( the other being ngc 660 ) , and is thus one of the easiest to study in detail .",
    "ngc 2685 is a double ring system , with both an inner , polar ring , and an outer ring that is co - planar with the host - galaxy disk ( see the images in sandage 1961 ) .",
    "unless otherwise stated , when we refer to `` the ring '' we will be speaking of the polar ring .",
    "some basic properties of the system are given in table 1 .",
    "the host galaxy and the ring are both fairly red .",
    "the system has @xmath6 , similar to field di galaxies ( e.g.  roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "the   distribution was mapped by shane ( 1980 ) .",
    "his westerbork data have a final resolution of @xmath350@xmath7 , and show the  to be associated with the inner and outer rings , with no detected emission from the host galaxy . a comparison with the single - dish observations of richter et al .",
    "( 1994 ) shows that the westerbork maps are not missing any significant flux from extended emission .",
    "hodge ( 1974 ) was the first to point out that the ring has a large population of  regions .",
    "it is unclear if the co @xmath8 emission detected by taniguchi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) is coming from the ring , or from the host nucleus , however watson , guptill & buchholz ( 1994 ) clearly detect co @xmath9 emission from the polar ring , and conclude that the ring is rich in molecular gas .",
    "ngc 2685 has no close , massive companions .",
    "there are two cataloged dis within @xmath330@xmath10 ( ugc 4683 and mcg+10 - 13 - 030 ) .",
    "ugc 4683 has a comparable radial velocity to ngc 2685 ( @xmath11 , de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "there is no published velocity for mcg+10 - 13 - 030 .",
    "there is a loose group of galaxies between @xmath12 and @xmath13 north of ngc 2685 , but all these systems have substantially higher radial velocities ( 12881518 @xmath14  rc3 ) .",
    "thus they do not appear to be physically associated with ngc 2685 .",
    "we obtained optical spectrophotometry of eleven  regions in the polar ring of ngc 2685 with the mmt blue channel spectrograph on three successive nights in november and december 1994 .",
    "table 2 gives the details of the observations .",
    "the detector was a loral 3072@xmath151024 ccd .",
    "we used the 500g / mm @xmath16=5410  grating , and a @xmath17 slit , resulting in a spectral range of 3500   7100 , and a spectral resolution of @xmath35  ( fwhm ) , with a sampling of 1.15  per pixel .",
    "we binned the data by 2 pixels in the spatial direction before read - out , giving a spatial sampling of @xmath18 per binned pixel .",
    "the seeing was @xmath191@xmath20 throughout the run , and the weather was photometric .",
    "figure 1 shows a continuum - subtracted h@xmath2 + [ ] emission line image of ngc 2685 obtained with the ohio state imaging fabry - perot spectrometer ( pogge et al .",
    "1995 ) in direct imaging mode on the 1.8 m perkins telescope of the ohio wesleyan and ohio state universities in flagstaff arizona .",
    "we have marked the observed  regions and the slit positions on this image .",
    "in addition to the ring  regions , fig .  1 shows extended h@xmath2 emission around the nucleus of ngc 2685 .",
    "this emission was discovered by ulrich ( 1975 ) .",
    "the gas is rotating about the minor axis of the host , and has a liner - type spectrum .",
    "the h@xmath2 morphology of this material is asymmetric ; the emission is much stronger to the nw than to the se .",
    "this is also obvious from the [ ] @xmath213727  line - intensities shown by ulrich ( 1975 ) .",
    "her spectra also show that the nw side is the approaching side .",
    "this , and our continuum imaging lead us to believe that the asymmetry is largely due to internal extinction in ngc 2685 .",
    "we corrected our data for bias , overscan , and flat - field patterns in the standard way , using vista ( stover 1988 ) .",
    "we prepared the slit - illumination frame using iraf .",
    "we extracted 1-d spectra from the images using the spectrum of a bright continuum source as a trace of the positional variation along the dispersion axis .",
    "we obtained henear lamp frames before and after each target observation to provide the primary wavelength calibrations .",
    "typically , we had to apply small secondary corrections from the night - sky lines on the actual data frames .",
    "we used 2050 pixel regions near the ends of the slits to determine the sky subtraction .",
    "we used the kpno tables to correct the spectra for atmospheric extinction .",
    "we obtained repeated observations of the spectrophotometric standards feige 15 , feige 34 , and hiltner 600 throughout each night in order to flux calibrate our spectra .",
    "we observed the standards with a @xmath22 slit to minimize slit - losses .",
    "we emphasize that although the absolute flux calibration of our spectra is subject to unknown systematics due to such things as slit placement , sky subtraction , slit losses , and tracking errors , the relative line fluxes should be accurately determined . as we obtained spectra at a number of position angles , often quite far from the parallactic angle , and over a moderate range in air - mass",
    "( typically 1.11.4 ) , we investigated the possibility that our results are compromised by atmospheric dispersion . from a comparison of the relative line fluxes of h@xmath2 and [ ] in spectra of the  region r2 ,",
    "obtained over a range of air - masses , we found no evidence of the sort of systematic changes in flux ratios that would indicate a substantial problem due to atmospheric dispersion .",
    "after flux - calibrating the individual exposures , we measured the centroids of the bright emission lines , and used these data to correct all exposures of a given  region to the same wavelength scale .",
    "the individual exposures were then merged , providing total exposure times of between 2 and 7 hours for each  region . in figure 2 , we present the final spectra for two of our targets , demonstrating the full range in quality of our dataset .",
    "we extracted emission line fluxes and equivalent widths from our spectra using the vista package liner ( pogge & owen 1993 ) . as we do not detect [ ] @xmath214363  in any of our spectra , we also evaluated the continuum rms at @xmath34350 , to determine upper limits for this line .",
    "the recessional velocity of ngc 2685 ( see table 1 ) puts the  4358   emission line from the tucson streetlights into the spectral region between h@xmath23 and [ ] 4363 .",
    "we avoid this region in estimating the upper limit on [ ] 4363  emission .",
    "we used the following procedure for our line - analysis :    the foreground absorption for ngc 2685 is @xmath24rc3 ) .",
    "we found that our results were generally more self - consistent if we did not correct for this explicitly , but instead determined an overall estimate for the absorption using the balmer decrement .",
    "this is a reasonable approach due to the small redshift of ngc 2685 .",
    "the calculation was complicated by the aforementioned  4358  contamination which prevented us from measuring h@xmath23 in our spectra .",
    "however most of our spectra have good detections of h@xmath25 , giving us at least two balmer line ratios with which to determine the balmer decrement .",
    "we note that most of our sample have _ total _",
    "computed @xmath26 s that are less than the _ foreground _ value of 0.12 mag ( for @xmath27 ) from the rc3 .",
    "we used the observed fluxes of the [ ] @xmath214959 , and [ ] @xmath215007  lines , along with the 3@xmath28 upper limits to the [ ] @xmath214363  line to determine upper limits to @xmath29 following the prescriptions in osterbrock ( 1989 ) , and assuming the electron density ( @xmath30 ) in the low - density limit .",
    "we then used the flux ratio of the [ ] @xmath316717 , 6731  lines to determine @xmath30 for a range of temperatures consistent with the @xmath29 limits .",
    "this was accomplished following osterbrock ( 1989 ) , but using the updated atomic physics calculations of cai & pradhan ( 1993 ) .",
    "we note that the derived densities are commensurate with our assumption of the low - density limit in our @xmath29 calculations in all cases .",
    "we determined total @xmath26 estimates from the ratios of the balmer lines , using case b recombination , ( osterbrock 1989 ) for @xmath32 k , and assuming absorption equivalent widths of 2  for the balmer sequence ( following mccall , rybski & shields 1985 ) . for a derived @xmath33",
    "no extinction correction was made . for @xmath34",
    ", we used the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) . in table 3",
    "we present the line strengths for all detected lines in all our targets .",
    "the line strengths are scaled to the h@xmath35 fluxes .",
    "we give the measured fluxes before correction for extinction and balmer absorption ( @xmath36 ) , and after these corrections ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we also give the measured equivalent widths in  , and the statistical signal to noise for each line .",
    "as we do not detect [ ] @xmath214363  in any of our  region spectra , we can not derive the oxygen abundance directly .",
    "instead we use the semi - empirical @xmath38 method ( e.g.  edmunds & pagel 1984 ; dopita & evans 1986 ) to determine the oxygen abundances .",
    "@xmath38 is defined as follows : @xmath39 where the @xmath40 s represent the fully corrected fluxes for the given lines . as",
    "the @xmath38oxygen abundance relationship is double - valued , we need to determine which branch of the @xmath38-abundance curve is appropriate for our objects .",
    "typically , this is done using the ratio of [ ] @xmath216583   to [ ] @xmath213727  ( mcgaugh 1994 , ryder 1995 ) , where @xmath41[]/[]@xmath42 implies use of the high - abundance branch .",
    "this criterion hold for all our sample .",
    "we thus adopt the upper abundance branch calibration of @xmath38 with @xmath43 of dopita & evans ( 1986 ) , as presented by oey & kennicutt ( 1993 ) .",
    "we present these results , with all other derived quantities for our sample , in table 4 .",
    "the derived o / h abundances listed in table 4 are limited by a systematic uncertainty of @xmath44  dex in @xmath43 in the absolute calibration of @xmath38 ( oey & kennicutt 1993 ) . by comparison , the formal statistical uncertainties in the derived @xmath43 based on measurment errors in @xmath38 range from @xmath45  dex for  regions with the lowest signal - to - noise spectra ( r8b and r9 ) , to @xmath46  dex in the best spectra .",
    "the oxygen abundances we derive for the 11  regions in our sample are in the range @xmath47 , with an average value of @xmath48 for the polar ring . taking @xmath49 ( grevesse & anders 1989 ) , this means the  regions in our sample have oxygen abundances of 0.81.1 @xmath0 .",
    "we compare this with the results of zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra ( 1994 ) , who obtained similar data for a sample of field spirals .",
    "our abundance result matches the median of their sc sample , and fits in the range of their sbc s .",
    "when combined with other observed properties , as discussed below , this poses a substantial problem for understanding the origin and chemical enrichment history of the polar ring in ngc 2685 .    as discussed in  1 , polar rings",
    "are typically considered to be debris of captured di galaxies .",
    "such systems are metal - poor in all studied cases ( e.g.  mathews , boyd & fuller 1993 ) .",
    "other possible sources of the ring material ( the outer part of a spiral , or primordial  gas ) will also be metal - poor .",
    "in fact , there are few , if any , easily accretable sources of high - abundance gas in the universe .",
    "further , ngc 2685 is _ not _ a particularly luminous system ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it has a total @xmath50-band luminosity roughly that of m33 ( van den bergh 1992 ) .",
    "it is therefore very difficult to imagine that it could have accreted metal - rich gas from deep in the potential well of a more massive spiral disk .",
    "thus , for the gas to be metal - rich , it must have self - enriched , despite the fact that dis of similar overall properties ( gas - content and luminosity ) have not been able to do so .",
    "this means that the polar ring surrounding ngc 2685 must be both stable ( with a lifetime comparable to the hubble time ) _ and _ self - gravitating .    we have observed only one  region from the outer ring ( r9 ) . while our spectrum of this object has the lowest signal to noise in our dataset , it appears to have an oxygen abundance similar to those found for the inner ring  regions .",
    "we thus see no evidence for significantly different abundances in the two rings .",
    "we also see no evidence for any azimuthal pattern in our abundance results .",
    "this argues that the ring gas is likely to be dynamically well - mixed , and that our results indicate a generally high oxygen abundance in the ring gas , rather than local enrichment .",
    "our results thus strongly support the self - gravitating model of prgs in the case of ngc 2685 .",
    "this is curious , due to the complex appearence of the system .",
    "ngc 2685 possesses both an inner ( polar ) ring , and an outer ( planar ) ring .",
    "further , the appearance of the inner ring is anything but smooth and relaxed ( ngc 2685 has long been known as `` the helix galaxy '' and `` the spindle '' after all ) .",
    "these results thus pose the following problem for dynamical modellers : is it possible to construct a stable , self - consistent model of a self - gravitating ring structure that reproduces the apparent complexity of ngc 2685 ?",
    "the work of steiman - cameron , kormendy & durisen ( 1992 ) indicates that it may be , but certainly the question is far from resolved",
    ". the most detailed work on dynamical modelling of ngc 2685 is that of peletier & christodoulou ( 1993 ) , who modelled the two - ring structure , but did not attempt to reproduce the complex appearence of the inner ring .",
    "they concluded that a double - ring structure such as that of ngc 2685 can be very long lived if the underlying potential is triaxial .",
    "they also argue that the ring stars have a mean age of no more than 56 gyr , based on the broad - band colors of the ring , and an assumption that the ring is fairly metal - poor .",
    "our results argue against this assumption , and thus indicate a substantially younger photometric age for the ( optical ) mean stellar population .",
    "we now turn our attention to fitting together the implications of the observed photometric , chemical , and dynamical properties of the polar ring .",
    "as noted in  2 , the  distribution in ngc 2685 was mapped by shane ( 1980 ) . although recent high resolution aperture synthesis observations of the  in ngc 4650a ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1997 ) reveal that earlier vla ( van gorkom , schechter & kristian 1987 ) data had seriously underestimated the total  content , we do not believe that this is a serious possibility in the case of ngc 2685 . for ngc 4650a , the  content from single - dish measurements ( richter et al .",
    "1994 ) is substantially higher than that from the vla data , and agrees reasonably well with the new atca data of arnaboldi et al .",
    "no such disagreement exists between the single - dish and westerbork results for ngc 2685 .",
    "so , taking shane s ( 1980 ) results for the  and dynamical mass of the polar ring , we find @xmath51 .",
    "according to roberts & haynes ( 1994 ) , this is typical of an sm or i m system .",
    "however , peletier & christodoulou ( 1993 ) give a @xmath52 for the polar ring .",
    "this is quite red ; roberts & haynes ( 1994 ) find @xmath53 typical of s0/a to sa galaxies .",
    "thus , although the polar ring has an  content typical of an i m , it is subtantially redder than such galaxies .",
    "peletier & christodoulou ( 1993 ) note that their colors may be reddened by the dust in the polar ring .",
    "if the true color of the ring is assumed to be a typical i m value ( @xmath54 ) , then one must assume @xmath55 from internal extinction .",
    "this is quite high , and requires a large ( but very model dependent  e.g.  davies et al .  1993 ;",
    "witt , thronson & capuano 1992 ) dust content , compared to that of a typical i m . of course abundance is known to correlate with dust content in galaxies ( e.g.  van den bergh & pierce 1990 ) .",
    "thus our abundance results argue for a higher relative dust content than might be found in a low abundace di .",
    "in fact , while the polar ring is obviously dusty ( see the image in sandage 1961 ) , the fir properties of ngc 2685 do not suggest an unusually high dust content .",
    "richter et al .  ( 1994 ) find an _ iras _ fir to blue luminosity ratio of @xmath56 , only slightly higher than the mean values of @xmath570.62 and @xmath570.88@xmath580.05 derived for samples of s0s by thronson , bally & hacking ( 1989 ) and eskridge & pogge ( 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath59 for the ring only will , of course , be higher .",
    "eskridge & pogge ( 1991 ) also note that ngc 2685 is  rich for its fir flux , compared to a sample of s0s",
    ". this may be largely due to the majority of the  being associated with the outer ring .",
    "thronson et al .  (",
    "1989 ) derive a dust mass for ngc 2685 based on its _ iras _ flux .",
    "scaled to our distance estimate , this is @xmath60 .",
    "if we assume that all the fir originates from the polar ring ( unlikely , as the host galaxy has a liner nucleus ) , this means @xmath61 .",
    "this argues against the existence of a vast quantity of dust in the polar ring .",
    "finally , we note that ngc 2685 falls in the midst of the distribution of @xmath59 for i m galaxies in the sample of melisse & israel ( 1994 ) , but falls at the very low end of their distribution for sc spirals . in summary , while the polar ring is clearly dusty , it is unlikely to have an internal extinction as high as @xmath55    we have measured a total h@xmath2 + [ ] equivalent width of 12  for the polar ring from our h@xmath2 imaging data .",
    "this is actually a lower limit , as there is clearly contamination in our continuum from the underlying host galaxy .",
    "we use our equivalent width , and the @xmath1 color of peletier & christodoulou to compare the polar ring of ngc 2685 to the spiral galaxy disk models of kennicutt , tamblyn & congdon ( 1994 ) .",
    "we find reasonably good matches for the observed h@xmath2 equivalent width and @xmath1 color with two models .",
    "one has a birthrate parameter of @xmath62 and exponentially decaying star formation with a decay timescale of @xmath63 gyr for a kennicutt ( 1983 ) imf .",
    "the other has @xmath64 and @xmath65 gyr for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf .",
    "the range of birthrate parameters we derive from the two good models overlap the kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1994 ) results for sa and sab galaxies .",
    "we can not obtain a reasonable fit with the scalo ( 1986 ) imf ; the model that comes closest is substantially too blue ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "if we assume that such a model is correct ( i.e.  that the measured @xmath1 color is strongly effected by reddening ) , then the scalo imf model yields a very high birthrate parameter ( @xmath67 ) , and an unconstrained decay time for star formation ( @xmath68 gyr ) .",
    "that is , a basically constant rate of star formation over the hubble time .",
    "finally , we can use our abundance measurement and the ring gas content to examine the chemical enrichment history of the polar ring compared with typical spiral galaxies .",
    "it is well known that the simple closed - box model for chemical evolution ( e.g.  schmidt 1963 ) overpredicts the enrichment for field spiral galaxies ( e.g.  shields , skillman & kennicutt 1991 ) .",
    "the closed - box formalism is expressed @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the overall or specific abundance in question , @xmath71 is the yield per unit mass of star formation , and @xmath72 is the gas mass fraction .",
    "as noted above , the results of shane ( 1980 ) give @xmath73 , or @xmath74 in typical notation . comparing this and our oxygen abundance to the field and virgo cluster spiral samples of shields et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , we find that the polar ring is substantially more enriched than field galaxies of a similar @xmath72 .",
    "the abundance is marginally below the simple closed - box model prediction , and substantially lower than that observed for virgo cluster spirals of similar @xmath72 .",
    "this comparison has been done ignoring molecular gas .",
    "the co @xmath8 observation of taniguchi et al .",
    "( 1990 ) was a single pointing , centered on the galaxy nucleus .",
    "it is unclear if the gas they detect is associated with the ring or the host galaxy .",
    "watson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) clearly detect co @xmath9 emission from a map made along the long axis of the polar ring .",
    "they detect the rotation of the ring in their data ; the molecular gas is clearly associated with the polar ring .",
    "watson et al .  ( 1994 ) derive an estimate of @xmath75 for the molecular mass of the polar ring ( scaled to our assumed distance ) assuming the @xmath76@xmath77 relationship of young & scoville ( 1991 ) , and further assuming the ratio of co @xmath9 to co @xmath8 to be @xmath30.7 .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath76@xmath77 depends on abundance ( e.g.  arimoto , sofue & tsujimoto 1996 ) .",
    "however , the ring has essentially solar abundance , and thus this should not be a factor .",
    "it has also been shown ( e.g.  maloney & black 1988 ) that the excitation temperature of the molecular gas ( or equivalently , the density of the interstellar radiation field ) also effects the @xmath76@xmath77 ratio .",
    "thus a high excitation temperature of the molecular gas may be inflating the mass estimate of watson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "we point this out for the following reason : watson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) derive an estimate of @xmath78 .",
    "this is above young & scoville s median value for s0-sa galaxies , but well within the range .",
    "young & scoville find a few spirals as late as sc with @xmath79 values as high as @xmath30.65 .",
    "this , despite an observed @xmath80 equal to that found for irregulars .",
    "furthermore , if we accept the watson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) result , this gives @xmath81 , or @xmath82 .",
    "it seems implausible , at best , that a red , solar abundance ring can have @xmath375% of its total _ dynamical _ mass in the form of gas . if we instead simply assume that the @xmath83 ratio is of order unity , we derive @xmath84 .",
    "all systems ( both in virgo and the field ) with such high @xmath72 values in the study of shields et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have substantially sub - solar oxygen abundances .",
    "our observed ( @xmath3solar ) abundance is roughly half a dex higher than these systems , and falls exactly on the prediction from the simple closed box model .",
    "we conclude by considering the implications of this work in the context of the recent papers of galletta , sage & sparke ( 1997 ) and arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . as we mentioned above , arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) present new atca  observations of ngc 4650a , and conclude that the total  content of the polar ring is nearly twice that indicated by earlier vla data .",
    "the total  mass of ngc 4650a is @xmath38@xmath1510@xmath85 , comparable to a typical sb spiral ( roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "arnaboldi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) further conclude that the kinematics of the  reveal evidence for spiral structure in the polar ring .",
    "ngc 2685 and ngc 4650a define the extremes of prg morphology . in ngc 2685",
    ", the radius of the polar ring is small compared to the optical radius of the host galaxy , while in ngc 4650a , the ring extends out to several host optical radii .",
    "thus while the systems can not be simply compared , they both present enormous difficulties for models that attempt to form polar rings out of material that is easily accreted in the universe today .",
    "galletta et al .  (",
    "1997 ) present co @xmath8 observations for a sample 10 objects from the catalog of whitmore et al .",
    "they supplement this with observations of two other systems ( including ngc 2685 ) taken from the literature .",
    "they derive h@xmath86 mass estimates for their sample from their co @xmath8 observations , assuming the galactic calibration of solomon et al .",
    "the galletta et al.(1997 ) h@xmath86 mass estimates are in the range @xmath87 , with @xmath83 typically 0.1  0.7 .",
    "while the calibration of h@xmath86 mass with co line intensity is uncertain at best , the key point is that prgs tend to be quite rich in molecular gas compared to di systems . indeed , they approach @xmath83 values typical of normal spiral galaxies ( e.g.  sage 1993 ) , although the overall h@xmath86 masses are small compared to typical spirals .",
    "the available data , and a number of dynamical models indicate the polar rings are stable , long - lived structures .",
    "furthermore , this work , and others that we have cited above reveal the rings to have physical and chemical properties unlike those of any plausible gas donor that exists currently .",
    "we speculate that polar rings were formed early in the history of galaxy evolution by interactions with relative angular momenta that favored capture into inclined orbits , rather than full mergers .",
    "thus the properties of such stable , old polar rings could provide us with information on the nature of the objects that merged to form normal galaxies in the current universe .",
    "we have presented the results of our spectrophotometric study of  regions in the polar ring of ngc 2685 .",
    "the oxygen abundances of the 11  regions in our sample are all in the range 0.81.1 @xmath0 , with no evidence for any azimuthal abundance pattern .",
    "thus the polar ring has a gas phase abundance typical of sbc or sc spirals , despite having an  content ( and mass fraction ) typical of a di galaxy . at first glance",
    "this appears to require the polar ring to be a long - lived , self gravitating feature , despite its obvious complexity .",
    "while this may be the case , a more careful consideration of the observed properties of the ring make it clear that the ring can not be the remnant of anything like a current di galaxy .",
    "it has a @xmath1 color as red as a typical s0/a or sa galaxy .",
    "this , combined with its h@xmath2 equivalent width , indicates a starforming history typical of an sa or sab spiral .",
    "it has molecular gas properties that are more in keeping with an early - type disk galaxy than a di . finally , it is one of those rarest of objects that is actually well - fit by the simple closed - box chemical enrichment model .",
    "what this seems to require is that the host galaxy accreted a low - luminosity object that was either already enriched at the time of the interaction , or that was massive enough ( despite its low optical luminosity ) to retain the enrichment products of stellar evolution over the course of the subsequent history of the system .",
    "there are no obvious field counterparts of either such object in the universe today .",
    "we can not draw any sweeping conclusions regarding the class of polar - ring galaxies based on these results for one object .",
    "rather , they indicate that a larger study is warranted .",
    "we have obtained the nessecary spectrophotometry for two other kinematically confirmed prgs , and have the h@xmath2 imaging needed to define spectrophotometric targets for seven of the remaining eight currently confirmed prgs .",
    "we take great pleasure in thanking carol heller for being a superb mmt operator , and the mmt tac for awarding us the observing time .",
    "we also thank bill keel and dimitris christodoulou for helpful discussion , and the referee for several excellent suggestions .",
