    "the argo - ybj experiment is in stable data taking since november 2007 with a duty cycle @xmath185% and with excellent performance .",
    "the large field of view ( @xmath22 sr ) and the high duty cycle allow a continuous monitoring of the sky in the declination band from -10@xmath3 to 70@xmath3 .",
    "several interesting results are available in cosmic ray ( cr ) physics as well as in gamma ray astronomy with the first 3 years of operation .",
    "we observed tev emission from 3 sources with a significance greater than 5 standard deviations ( s.d . ) : crab nebula , mrk421 and mgro j1908 + 06 .",
    "in particular we observed the crab nebula with a significance of 14 s.d . in @xmath2800 days .",
    "a detailed long - term monitoring of the mrk421 flaring activity has been carried out in 2008 - 2009 . a clear correlation with x - ray data was found .",

    "@xcite argo - ybj has performed a search for emission from grbs in coincidence with 93 events observed by satellites ( 16 with known redshift ) , setting upper limits on the fluence between 10@xmath4 and 10@xmath5 erg @xmath6 in the 1 - 100 gev energy range @xcite .",
    "a medium - scale cr anisotropy has been observed with a significance greater than 10 s.d . at proton median energy of about 2 tev .",
    "two excesses ( corresponding to a flux increase of @xmath20.1% ) are observed by argo - ybj around the positions @xmath7 120@xmath3 , @xmath8 40@xmath3 and @xmath7 60@xmath3 , @xmath8 -5@xmath3 @xcite , in agreement with a similar detection reported by the milagro collaboration @xcite .",
    "the origin of this medium - scale anisotropy is puzzling .",
    "in fact , these regions have been interpreted as excesses of hadronic crs , but tev crs are expected to be randomized by the magnetic fields . understanding these anisotropies should be a high priority as they are probably due to a nearby source of crs , as suggested by some authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    with 2 years of data we carried out a 2d measurement of the cr large - scale anisotropy to investigate detailed structural information beyond the simple right ascension profiles .",

    "the preliminary results are in good agreement with the cream balloon data .",
    "for the first time direct and ground - based measurements overlap for a wide energy range thus making possible the cross - calibration of the different experimental techniques .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath9 ratio at few - tev energies has been performed setting two upper limits at the 90% confidence level : 5% at 1.4 tev and 6% at 5 tev @xcite . in the few - tev range",

    "the apparatus has modular structure , the basic data acquisition element being a cluster ( 5.7@xmath107.6 m@xmath11 ) , made of 12 rpcs ( 2.8@xmath101.25 m@xmath11 each ) .",
    "each chamber is read by 80 external strips of 6.75@xmath1061.8 @xmath0 ( the spatial pixels ) , logically organized in 10 independent pads of 55.6@xmath1061.8 @xmath0 which represent the time pixels of the detector .",
    "the read - out of 18360 pads and 146880 strips are the experimental output of the detector @xcite .",
    "the rpcs are operated in streamer mode by using a gas mixture ( ar 15% , isobutane 10% , tetrafluoroethane 75% ) for high altitude operation .",

    "this logic is based on a time correlation between the pad signals depending on their relative distance . in this way , all the shower events giving a number of fired pads n@xmath13 n@xmath14 in the central carpet in a time window of 420 ns generate the trigger .",
    "this can work with high efficiency down to n@xmath14 = 20 , keeping the rate of random coincidences negligible .",
    "the whole system , in smooth data taking since july 2006 firstly with argo-130 , is in stable data taking with the full apparatus of 153 clusters since november 2007 with the trigger condition n@xmath14 = 20 and a duty cycle @xmath1585% .",

    "@xcite . the measured angular resolution is better than 0.5@xmath3 for cr - induced showers with energies e @xmath1 5 tev ( fig .",

    "mrk421 is one of the brightest blazars and the closest to us ( z = 0.031 ) , characterized by a strong broadband flaring activity with a variability time scale ranging from minutes to months .",
    "a correlation of vhe gamma rays with x - rays has been observed during single flaring episodes by different detectors and can be interpreted in terms of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model .",

    "/ tev correlation is quite evident over more than 2 years .",
    "the steepness of the curve gives the flux variation , therefore we observed an active period at the beginning of 2008 followed by a quiet phase .",
    "cross - correlation functions were measured to quantify the degree of correlation and the phase difference ( time lag ) between the variations in x - ray and tev bands , using the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) @xcite .",

    "the peak positions , evaluated by fitting the distributions with a gaussian function around the maximum , are -0.14@xmath27 and -0.94@xmath28 days for rxte / asm and swift data , respectively .",

    "the rxte / asm detector is monitoring mrk421 in three energy bands : 1.5 - 3 , 3 - 5 and 5 - 12 kev . by assuming a power - law x - ray energy spectrum we calculated the spectral indices in the 4 flux bands : -2.02@xmath200.08 , -2.05@xmath200.03 , -2.15@xmath200.03 and -2.43@xmath200.04 .",
    "a correlation is clearly recognized in the sense that higher fluxes are accompanied by harder energy spectra .",
    "this result , obtained by averaging the mrk421 emission over about 2 years , extends similar conclusions obtained by averaging observations over much shorter periods @xcite .    with this information we studied the relation between tev spectral index and flux .",

    "they globally affect the quoted fluxes for @xmath36 30@xmath12 . given the flat slope , above a few tev the mgroj1908 + 06 flux becomes larger than the crab nebula one .",
    "a significant disagreement appears between the argo - ybj and hess spectra .",
    "concerning argo - ybj and milagro , considering the large errors in the flux measurements ( the error on the milagro flux is @xmath230@xmath12 at 10 tev and larger at lower energies ) , the apparent disagreement could be likely due to statistical fluctuations . in the limit of the statistical accuracy of this result ,",
    "our data supports the milagro measurement of a flux significantly larger than that measured by hess .",
    "one possible cause of this discrepancy is that argo - ybj and milagro integrate the signal over a solid angle larger than the hess one , and likely detect more of the diffuse lateral tail of the extended source .",
    "a further interesting possibility is the variability of the source , since the hess data consist of 27 hours of observations in 2005 - 2007 , before our measurements ."
