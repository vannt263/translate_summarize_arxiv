    "potential models have been found to be surprisingly successful in describing the meson spectrum , even at rather small quark masses , @xmath1  @xcite . to derive the semi - relativistic hamiltonian one usually starts from the bethe - salpeter amplitude of a two - quark bound state with quark separation @xmath2 , takes the static solution ( @xmath3 ) of the kernel , and expands it in inverse powers of the quark mass around this limit .",
    "the result can be decomposed into the five relativistic invariants ( s , v , t , a and p ) with @xmath2 dependent ( unknown ) coefficient functions , the spin dependent potentials ( sdps ) .",
    "so far , sdps have been studied in the mid eighties  @xcite on the lattice .",
    "the applicability of the potential approach to heavy quark physics can be tested on the lattice by comparing the spectrum and wave functions , obtained from the semi - relativistic hamiltonian with sdps , to nrqcd results .",
    "in addition we aim at replacing phenomenologically adjusted potentials by the `` correct '' qcd potentials .",
    "the order @xmath4 hamiltonian , obtained in the manner described above , is a generalisation of the familiar breit - fermi hamiltonian .",
    "apart from a purely kinetic term , it reads as follows ( for equal masses ) , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 are velocity dependent corrections .",
    "explicit expectation values have been associated to the spin - orbit and spin - spin `` potentials '' @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which can be computed on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "these potentials are related to scalar ( @xmath11 ) , vector ( @xmath12 ) and pseudo - scalar ( @xmath13 ) exchange contributions in the following way : @xmath14 in addition , relativistic invariance yields the gromes relation  @xcite , @xmath15 .",
    "from the cornell form of the central potential , @xmath16 , and tree level perturbation theory one expects @xmath17 since all these potentials ( up to @xmath18 ) are predicted to be short ranged , we have chosen small lattice spacings to be sensitive to the physically interesting region : we operate at the values @xmath19 and @xmath20 that correspond to resolutions @xmath21  fm and @xmath22  fm , respectively . the physical scale has been obtained from the relation @xmath23  mev .",
    "more than 200 statistically independent configurations of lattice volume @xmath24 have been collected at each coupling .    in order to reduce statistical fluctuations ,",
    "temporal links are integrated analytically wherever possible  @xcite .",
    "the sdps have been defined in a way analogous to the computation of local masses to exclude corrections proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "the lattice correlation functions , @xmath26 , to be measured are wilson loops with two colour field insertions ( ears ) within the temporal transporters , divided by the corresponding loop without ears ( @xmath27 denotes the ear - ear temporal distance ) .",
    "one ear excites the gluon field between the two charges while the second returns the field into its ground state . to obtain the sdps ,",
    "an integration over all possible interaction times ( temporal positions of the ears ) has to be performed .",
    "the minimal distance , @xmath28 , of an ear to an `` end '' of the wilson loop , occurring within the integration , represents the time the gluon field has to decay into its ground state after creation and , therefore , governs excited state contaminations . the spatial transporters within the wilson loops",
    "are smeared  @xcite to suppress such pollutions from the beginning , allowing us to reduce @xmath28 : plateaus in the ear - ear correlators have been found from @xmath29 onwards ( in some cases even @xmath30 ) .    in our implementation the positions of the ears in respect to the wilson loop ends are kept fixed at @xmath29 . the interaction time is varied by increasing the temporal wilson loop extent .",
    "this results in smaller statistical fluctuations , compared to the standard definition  @xcite in which the temporal extent of the wilson loop is kept fixed and the positions of the ears are varied .",
    "previous authors replaced the integration over @xmath27 by a discrete sum .",
    "the resulting discretization error adds to other lattice artefacts .",
    "we take into account that @xmath26 depends on @xmath27 in a multi - exponential way and approximate the integral from @xmath27 to @xmath31 by the expression @xmath32 , instead . for @xmath18 and @xmath33 where @xmath26 is weighted by an additional factor @xmath27 an analogous interpolating formula is used .",
    "the @xmath34 tail of the correlator is estimated from an exponential fit .",
    "an integration cut - off @xmath35 is chosen such that the statistical error exceeds the estimated contribution from the asymptotic tail by a factor four .",
    "the lattice sdps undergo multiplicative renormalizations in respect to their continuum counterparts , while @xmath36 does not .",
    "a non - perturbative renormalization of these quantities in the manner suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite is performed . in fig .",
    "1 the quality of this normalization is checked by comparing the gromes combination @xmath37 ( in units of the string tension , @xmath38 ) to the force ( solid curve ) , derived from a fit to the central potential .",
    "we find good scaling behaviour among the two data sets ( @xmath19 and 2.96 ) and validity of the gromes relation outside of the region of lattice artifacts .",
    "a more detailed description of the improvement tricks and data analysis can be found in ref .",
