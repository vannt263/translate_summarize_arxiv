    "recently , the complete integrability of the nonlinear oscillator equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary parameters and overdot denotes the differentiation with respect to @xmath3 , has been demonstrated through @xmath4-symmetry approach @xcite .",
    "eq.([eq1 ] ) admits the general solution of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two arbitrary constants and the frequency @xmath8 is related to the amplitude @xmath6 through the relation @xmath9 .",
    "eq.([eq1 ] ) was introduced by mathews and lakshmanan in 1974 @xcite . later",
    "higgs and leeman studied the classical and quantum dynamics of the oscillator ( [ eq1 ] ) on the spherical configuration space @xcite .    during the past few years a considerable number of studies have been devoted to analyze the physical and mathematical properties of eq.([eq1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "eq.([eq1 ] ) is obtainable from the lagrangian @xmath10 from which the hamiltonian can be given in the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "one might note that both the lagrangian and the hamiltonian are given in  non - standard form \" @xcite .",
    "in fact the hamiltonian given above is now being called `` position - dependent mass hamiltonian''@xcite .",
    "the term @xmath13 which appear along with momentum in the hamiltonian can be treated as mass , that is @xmath14 . in the contemporary literature ,",
    "the quantization of position - dependent mass hamiltonian is of considerable interest @xcite .",
    "very recently , the classical and quantum dynamics of the nonlinear non - polynomial oscillator ( [ eq1 ] ) and its higher dimensional versions have been studied in various aspects , see for example refs.@xcite .",
    "eq.([eq1 ] ) is integrable by quadrature but admits only time - translational symmetry @xcite . since eq.([eq1 ] ) lacks sufficient number of lie point symmetries , the complete integrability of it from symmetries perspective was achieved through @xmath4-symmetry approach @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the earlier result @xcite and to demonstrate that the above nonlinear non - polynomial oscillator equation does possess other symmetries , namely adjoint symmetries , contact symmetries , telescopic vector fields and other integrability quantifiers such as jacobi last multipliers and darboux polynomials .",
    "an important framework which we make here is that one can determine all the aforementioned quantities from @xmath4-symmetry approach itself @xcite . through this demonstration",
    "we give not only new dimensions to the @xmath4-symmetry approach but also report additional symmetries exhibited by eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "the approach introduced here is applicable to a class of nonlinear oscillators .",
    "we extract all our results from theorem 5 and the corollary 6 given by muriel and romero @xcite .",
    "to be self - contained , in the following , we recall this corollary : `` if @xmath4 is such that @xmath15 is a @xmath4-symmetry of ( [ eq1 ] ) the any solution @xmath16 of the first - order linear system @xmath17+(\\phi_{\\dot{x}}-\\lambda)\\mu=0,~~\\mu_x+(\\lambda \\mu)_{\\dot{x}}=0 $ ] is an integrating factor of ( [ eq1 ] ) '' . here",
    "the function @xmath16 should satisfy both the equations in order to be an integrating factor for the given second - order ordinary differential equation ( ode ) @xmath18 . since eq.([eq1 ] ) admits only time - translational symmetry , in order to establish the integrability of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) through symmetry perspective , one should probe other symmetries , namely @xmath4-symmetries , telescopic vector fields and contact symmetries",

    "@xcite describes a procedure to derive integrating factors from @xmath4-symmetries . in this respect , they can be treated as important .",
    "however , in this work , we utilize the aforementioned corollary to identify the different types of symmetries of ( [ eq1 ] ) . in our analysis",
    ", we consider two cases , namely ( i ) @xmath19 and ( ii ) @xmath20 . in the first case we have @xmath21+\\phi_{\\dot{x}}\\mu=0 $ ] .",
    "the reduced equation is nothing but the jacobi last multiplier determining equation for the given dynamical system . solving this equation",
    "we can obtain the jacobi last multiplier @xmath22 .",
    "the obtained @xmath16 need not satisfy the second expression , that is @xmath23 , since @xmath16 is not an integrating factor .",
    "once jacobi last multiplier is known the inverse of it readily provides darboux polynomials @xcite . from jacobi last multiplier we can derive the lagrangian for the given equation . in the second case ,",
    "we consider @xmath4 is a non - zero function and is determined already for the given equation . now solving the first equation ,",
    "that is @xmath21+(\\phi_{\\dot{x}}-\\lambda)\\mu=0 $ ] , we can obtain @xmath16 .",
    "the obtained @xmath16 may or may not satisfy the second equation , that is @xmath24 .",
    "if it satisfies then it acts as an adjoint - symmetry as well as integrating factor for the given equation . in the other case it just acts as an adjoint - symmetry for the given ode . in this sense",
    "the adjoint - symmetries can be identified from @xmath4-symmetry approach . to determine contact symmetries we recall the relation @xcite @xmath25}{q}$ ] , where @xmath26 is the characteristics and @xmath27 is the total differential operator , that is @xmath28 . with known @xmath4",
