    "the study of exact spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations has been reinvigorated over the last decade or so and we now have a remarkable collection of solution generating techniques @xcite . at the same time , interest in exact anisotropic fluid solutions of einstein s equations has grown @xcite . whereas a solution generating technique is known for anisotropic fluids @xcite , this requires the specification of two input functions and one is not guaranteed a reasonable output , say in the density @xmath2 .",
    "a less general technique is given here , but the algorithm presented requires only one input function , the density itself .",
    "the technique is demonstrated by the construction of an infinite number of regular solutions , some of which satisfy all the standard energy conditions .",
    "let us write the geometry in the familiar form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the metric of a unit 2-sphere ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the source of ( [ metric ] ) , by way of einstein s equations , is taken to be a comoving fluid described by the stress - energy tensor @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "einstein s equations give the effective gravitational mass @xmath7 the source equation for @xmath8 @xmath9 and the generalized tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation which we write in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the fluid distribution is assumed to terminate at @xmath12 where @xmath13 and to join there , by way of a regular boundary surface , onto a schwarzschild vacuum of mass @xmath14 .",
    "no further conditions need be specified for this junction .",
    "a fluid is considered regular if it is free of singularities .",
    "scalar polynomial singularities involve scalar invariants built out of the riemann tensor . due to the spherical symmetry assumed here",
    ", there are only four independent invariants of this type @xcite .",
    "a direct calculation shows that @xmath15 and @xmath16 do not enter these invariants and that the ricci invariants are regular as long as @xmath17 and @xmath18 are .",
    "however , the second weyl invariant grows like @xmath19 as @xmath20 . as a consequence",
    ", we have the following necessary conditions for regularity @xmath21 the latter of which is already obvious from ( [ peqn ] ) .",
    "one could , of course , incorporate derivatives of the riemann tensor into the construction of invariants .",
    "for example , a calculation shows that @xmath22 grows like @xmath23 as @xmath20 where @xmath24 is the ricci scalar and @xmath25 is the covariant dalembertian .",
    "however , the background theory involves the riemann tensor , not its derivatives , and so we impose no a priori restrictions beyond ( [ regular ] ) .",
    "the algorithm proposed here involves the use of the newtonian hydrostatic equilibrium equation for an isotropic fluid , @xmath26 in effect then @xmath2 and @xmath27 are related exactly as in the newtonian theory of isotropic fluids , e.g. @xcite . a solution in einstein s theory",
    "is obtained simply by reading off @xmath18 from ( [ peqn ] ) . no isotropic solutions for einstein",
    "s theory can be found in this way since if we set @xmath28 in ( [ peqn ] ) , and use ( [ hydro ] ) , the resultant quadratic equation for @xmath27 returns @xmath29 .",
    "one can take the view that it is the tangential stress @xmath18 that holds these configurations together . from ( [ peqn ] ) and ( [ hydro ] ) , and assuming @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 explicitly , inserting ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ hydro ] ) into ( [ peqn ] ) we obtain @xmath32 as a result , the weak and classical strong energy conditions are automatically satisfied via the proposed algorithm , as long as @xmath30 .",
    "the dominant energy condition is not @xcite .",
    "however , in the present circumstance , the classical strong energy conditions are in fact weaker than the weak energy conditions and so the trace energy condition @xmath33 is usually applied .",
    "subject to ( [ trace ] ) it is known that the buchdahl bound @xmath34 @xcite is robust @xcite . from ( [ trace ] )",
    "we can write @xmath35 and consider the dominant energy condition as @xmath36 and the stronger trace energy condition as @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the procedure outlined above can be executed with the specification of @xmath2 alone .",
    "we demonstrate this here with an infinite number of simple examples mostly derived from the ansatz @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 is an integer @xmath43 .",
    "first , let us consider the simplest case , that of constant density , @xmath44 @xcite .      from ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ rhos ] ) it follows that @xmath45 and so @xmath46 . from ( [ hydro ] ) , and setting @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath47 and so @xmath48 .",
    "this is a newtonian polytrope of zero index , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we can now simply read off @xmath18 from ( [ peqn ] ) with ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "we find    @xmath49    to avoid singularities in @xmath18 then @xmath50 and so for non - singular solutions @xmath51 as expected . at @xmath52",
    "we find @xmath53 along with @xmath54 at @xmath12 we find @xmath55 along with @xmath56 for solutions with @xmath57 , since @xmath58 , the dominant energy condition is also satisfied throughout the solution . from ( [ pgradboundaryconst ] ) for these solutions",
    "we find @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and so in the limiting case @xmath61 somewhat larger that the the buchdahl bound @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "some examples are shown in figure [ figure1 ] .    in order to demonstrate that energy conditions of the type ( [ radtio ] ) can be satisfied",
    ", it is convenient to define @xmath63 and @xmath64 so that @xmath65 a number of examples are shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "we set @xmath67 so that @xmath68 .",
    "other boundary conditions are given below . from ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ rhos ] ) it follows that @xmath69 and so @xmath70 from ( [ hydro ] ) , ( [ rhos ] ) and ( [ masss ] ) we obtain    @xmath71    we can now simply read off @xmath18 from ( [ peqn ] ) with ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a polynomial of degree @xmath74 , given explicitly in appendix a , and @xmath75 as shown in appendix b , ( [ poly ] ) has no roots for @xmath76 as long as @xmath77 subject to condition ( [ alimit ] ) then the solutions given here are free of singularities throughout the range @xmath78 .",
    "whereas the configurations satisfy the weak and strong energy conditions , the dominant energy condition is satisfied for sufficiently large @xmath39 .",
    "this is demonstrated below .    at @xmath52",
    "we find @xmath79 along with @xmath80 at @xmath12 we find @xmath81 along with @xmath82    from ( [ rs ] ) , ( [ ms ] ) and ( [ alimit ] ) we find @xmath83 since @xmath84 , the solutions given here allow an arbitrarily large degree of compactness , in principle .",
    "however , smaller values of @xmath85 correspond to smaller values of @xmath39 which lead to a violation of the dominant ( and therefor trace ) energy condition . again",
    ", this is demonstrated below . from ( [ tenuity ] )",
    "it follows that the buchdahl bound @xmath86 is obtained for @xmath87      for @xmath88 there is no `` core '' in the density .",
    "it follows from ( [ alimit ] ) that @xmath89 and from ( [ tenuity ] ) that @xmath90 .",
    "the physical variables are shown in figure [ figure3 ] for @xmath91 and in figure [ figure4 ] for @xmath92 , the buchdahl limit . in the first case",
    "all energy conditions ( excepting the trace ) are satisfied and @xmath93 .",
    "( the trace energy condition can be satisfied with a slightly larger @xmath39 , for example , @xmath94 . ) in the second case the dominant energy condition fails . unlike the case @xmath44 , the minimum @xmath85 for which the dominant energy condition is satisfied must be found numerically for each @xmath42 . for @xmath88 the minimum @xmath95 , of course above the buchdahl limit .      for @xmath96 it follows from ( [ alimit ] ) that @xmath97 and from ( [ tenuity ] ) that @xmath98 .",
    "the physical variables are shown in figure [ figure5 ] for @xmath99 and in figure [ figure6 ] for @xmath100 , the buchdahl limit . in the first case",
    "all energy conditions ( excepting the trace ) are satisfied and @xmath101 .",
    "( the trace energy condition can be satisfied with a slightly larger @xmath39 , for example , @xmath102 . ) in the second case the dominant energy condition fails .",
    "the solutions with @xmath103 are qualitatively similar , but with a flatter density profile for smaller @xmath104 , that is , a larger `` core '' .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "the newtonian polytrope of zero index was discussed above , but it is well known that there are two finite analytical polytropic solutions , e.g. @xcite . in this section",
    "we use a classical polytrope of index 1 to generate an anisotropic fluid .",
    "let us take @xmath105 where @xmath39 is a constant , so that from ( [ hydro ] ) @xmath106 and @xmath107 from ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ poly1rho ] ) we have @xmath108 and so @xmath109 from which we have @xmath110 and so @xmath111 for the buchdahl bound to hold .",
    "we now find @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a polynomial of degree @xmath114 , given explicitly in appendix c. at @xmath52 we find @xmath115 at @xmath12 we find @xmath116 along with @xmath117 where the last inequality assumes the buchdahl bound .",
    "these models are qualitatively similar to the case @xmath96 discussed above . in a manner analogous to figure [ figure2 ] some details associated with these models are shown in figure [ figure8 ] .",
    "an algorithm which converts isotropic newtonian static fluid spheres into anisotropic einsteinian static fluid spheres has been given which requires one input function , the density . an infinite number of explicit regular solutions have been generated , some of which satisfy all the standard energy conditions .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank hkan andrasson and boyko ivanov for useful comments .",
    "this work was supported by a grant from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "portions of this work were made possible by use of _ grtensorii _ @xcite .",
