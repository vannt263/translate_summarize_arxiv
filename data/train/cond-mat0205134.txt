    "in ref . @xcite we performed the spectroscopic studies of an influence of substitution of phosphorus by arsenic on the structure of valence and conduction bands , and on the parameters of wannier - mott excitons in mixed crystals ( solid solutions ) of isovalent substitution zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 at low levels of substitution @xmath9 . in present work",
    "we have proceeded with these studies at @xmath4 . by the other hand",
    "we have performed here the similar study ( in comparison to zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 ) of another type mixed crystals of isovalent substitution zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 at small substitution levels @xmath9 .",
    "as we know , the zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals were not studied earlier .",
    "both zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 and zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 belong to the mixed crystals of @xmath10 type , which are poorly investigated .",
    "@xmath11-znp@xmath2 ( further znp@xmath2 ) and znas@xmath2 crystals are strongly anisotropic direct - gap semiconductors ( energy gap : 1.6026 ev for znp@xmath2 and 1.052 ev for znas@xmath2 ) , which are characterized by the same symmetry group @xmath12 ( monoclinic syngony ) . besides the symmetry of the lattice",
    ", the similarity of znp@xmath2 and znas@xmath2 exists in the structure of energy bands and exciton states , namely , three excitonic series are observed in the absorption spectra of these crystals : dipole allowed c - series at @xmath13 polarization originating from @xmath14-states of c - exciton ( this series is observed in reflection spectra as well ) , forbidden b - series at @xmath15 polarization originating from @xmath14-states of b - exciton , and partially allowed a - series at @xmath16 polarization originating from @xmath14-states of a - exciton ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for znp@xmath2 and refs .",
    "@xcite for znas@xmath2 ) . in the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of these crystals at @xmath13 polarization , a series of lines caused by the radiative transitions from the ground and excited states of allowed c - exciton is observed ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for znp@xmath2 and ref .",
    "@xcite for znas@xmath2 ) . besides this emission series",
    ", the so - called b - line is observed in the pl spectra of znp@xmath2 at @xmath15 .",
    "b - line occurs due to the radiative transitions from the ground state of forbidden b - exciton and corresponds to b@xmath17-line of absorption b - series .",
    "in contrast to znp@xmath2 and znas@xmath2 crystals , cdp@xmath2 is indirect - gap semiconductor ( energy gap : 2.155 ev : see , e.g. @xcite ) , which is characterized by the different symmetry of lattice : symmetry group is @xmath18 for right - rotating and @xmath19 for left - rotating modification ( tetragonal syngony ) .",
    "therefore , the comparison study of an influence of substitution of @xmath20 by @xmath21 in zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 and of @xmath22 by @xmath23 in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 on parameters of energy bands and excitonic states seems to be rather interesting .",
    "the technological operations of growing of zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 and zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals were carried out according to described in ref .",
    "in the present work the low - temperature ( 1.8 k ) absorption , reflection and photoluminescence spectra of zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 crystals have been studied at the following levels of substitution of @xmath20 by @xmath21 : @xmath24 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.125 , 0.40 , 0.90 , 0.95 .",
    "respective spectra as well as spectra of pure znp@xmath2 ( @xmath25 ) and znas@xmath2 ( @xmath26 ) are presented in fig .",
    "as one can expect , the zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 crystals are direct - gap semiconductors as well as znp@xmath2 and znas@xmath2 .",
    "one can see from the figure , that in the mixed crystals the same excitonic c- , b- and a - series are observed , as in pure crystals .",
    "let us note the doublet structure of an absorption @xmath27 line of b - series in crystals with @xmath28 .",
    "proceeding from intensities and half - widths of the components of this doublet , we have made a conclusion , that narrow high - energy component is @xmath27 line of b - series .",
    "an origin of low - energy component , which is missing for crystals with @xmath29 , is not clear .",
    "one can see from absorption and reflection spectra of zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 crystals that at the increase of @xmath3 ( or at the increase of @xmath30 if to go from the znas@xmath2 side ) ''",
    "we mean the increase of @xmath3 at @xmath31 and the increase of @xmath30 at @xmath32 . ]",
    "the lines corresponding to exciton states with higher @xmath33 disappear , and the lines with @xmath34 broaden . probably , this fact is a result of `` blurring '' of the band edges , which takes place owing to fluctuations of crystal potential , caused by chaotic distribution of @xmath21 ( @xmath20 ) atoms in sites of lattice at substitution of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) atoms . in pl",
    "spectra the emission lines of free excitons can be easily separated from the lines of localized excitons ( including , most likely , emission of excitons autholocalized on fluctuations of crystal potential ) only at rather low substitution levels . at the increase of @xmath3",
    "the emission lines of both free and localized excitons broaden that is due to the fluctuations of crystal potential and corresponding fluctuations of the parameters of energy bands .",
    "it takes an attention on itself the fact of considerable increase of intensity of pl spectra at the increase of @xmath3 .",
    "most probably , this effect is due to two following causes .",
    "first one consists in the partial suppression of the spatial migration of excitons ( due to localization of excitons on fluctuations of crystal potential ) and the respective decrease of efficiency of non - radiative decay of excitons .",
    "second one consists in the fact that the processes of scattering of excitons on the lattice defects favour to more effective radiative decay of excitons .    with increase in concentration @xmath3 , spectral lines shift to the low - energy side , which is caused by the decrease of energy gap .",
    "this shift could be easily expected , taking into account the fact , that in znas@xmath2 energy gap is 0.55 ev smaller than in znp@xmath2 .",
    "the respective dependence @xmath35 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the dependence is slightly nonlinear ( sublinear ) .",
    "it has been fitted by the well - known dependence ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the energy gaps of znp@xmath2 and znas@xmath2 respectively , and @xmath39 is the coefficient of nonlinearity .",
    "the coefficient @xmath39 was obtained to be 0.05 .",
    "but besides the trivial decrease of @xmath7 with the increase of @xmath3 , there is also decrease of the excitonic series rydbergs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "values of @xmath7 and rydbergs were obtained from fitting of excitonic series by simple hydrogenlike dependence : @xmath40 .",
    "one can see from the figure that the dependences of excitonic rydbergs on @xmath3 are rather remarkable .",
    "these dependences are strongly superlinear at small @xmath3 ( close to znp@xmath2 ) and most linear at @xmath41 ( close to znas@xmath2 ) .",
    "strongest superlinearity takes place at @xmath9 .",
    "let us note that the rydbergs of b- and a - series decrease considerably : at crossing from znp@xmath2 to znas@xmath2 the rydbergs decrease more than in 3 times .",
    "meanwhile , the rydberg of a - series decreases sufficiently less : it decreases in 1.4 times .",
    "let us note that in znp@xmath2 the @xmath42 state of a - exciton is energy highest , and the @xmath42 state of b - exciton is energy lowest .",
    "but , due to the slower decrease of @xmath43 than ones observed for b- and a - series , at substitution levels @xmath44 the @xmath42 state of a - exciton leaves off to be the energy highest . and in extreme case of znas@xmath2 an opposite situation takes place : @xmath45-state is energy lowest .",
    "the @xmath42 state of allowed c - exciton is energy highest in znas@xmath2 crystal .",
    "there are exist two possible causes of such a fast decrease of excitonic rydbergs at small @xmath3 .",
    "first one is the decrease of exciton reduced mass at the increase of @xmath3 .",
    "this our assumption is based on the data of the exciton reduced masses in znp@xmath2 ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite ) and znas@xmath2 ( @xmath49 @xcite ) as well as on our previous evaluation of the dependences of @xmath50 and @xmath51 at small @xmath3 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath52 is the components of the reduced mass of exciton in znp@xmath2 in different crystallographic directions , and @xmath53 is the component of @xmath54 in the direction perpendicular to plane ( 100 ) ( this direction almost coincides with @xmath55 axis of crystal ) .",
    "second cause of the fast decrease of rydbergs at small @xmath3 is the possible fast increase of dielectric constant , as in znas@xmath2 @xmath56 is sufficiently higher : average value @xmath57 @xcite versus @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 in znp@xmath2 .",
    "slower decrease of excitonic rydbergs at higher @xmath3 can be most likely explained by possible slower decrease of the reduced exciton mass and increase of the dielectric constant at higher @xmath3 .",
    "there were also studied dependences on @xmath3 of the half - widths of absorption @xmath42 lines of b- and a - series .",
    "these dependences are given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . is due to the fact that the respective sample was rather thick , therefore , full absorption occurred in @xmath61- and @xmath45-lines .",
    "so , it was not possible to determine correctly the half - widths of these lines .",
    "as we have pointed out above , half - width of @xmath61-line for crystal with @xmath62 was determined for the high - energy component of doublet .",
    "] one can seen , that half - widths of @xmath61- and @xmath45-lines increase monotonously with the increase of @xmath3 .",
    "as known , the increase of half - width of exciton lines is the result of fluctuations of crystal potential and respective fluctuations of energy gap .",
    "the theory of influence of fluctuations of composition @xmath3 on half - width of exciton absorption lines was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where two extreme cases were considered .",
    "first one takes place , if the effective size of area of the crystal potential fluctuation @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the total mass of exciton and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 is the half - width of exciton line ) , is much larger than exciton bohr radius : @xmath67 . such situation , as a rule , takes place , if the effective masses of electron and hole are small and differ slightly : @xmath68 . in this case",
    "@xmath69 should depend on @xmath3 as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the concentration of sites of lattice , where the substituting atoms can `` sit '' .",
    "such a situation occurs in many semiconductors , in particular in @xmath73 crystals .",
    "the second case takes place at @xmath74 .",
    "it takes place at @xmath75 . in this case ,",
    "dependence @xmath76 has such character @xmath77 the experimental dependences @xmath76 for absorption @xmath61- and @xmath45-lines of zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 crystals are presented in fig .",
    "likely to data presented in our work @xcite the experimental points are badly fitted both by function ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) . in znp@xmath2 and znas@xmath2",
    "crystals the effective size of area of crystal potential fluctuation is about some tens of angstrom , and the bohr radii of b- and a - excitons in these crystals are the following : @xmath78 , @xmath79 in znp@xmath2 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 in znas@xmath2 , i.e. @xmath82",
    ". therefore , the extreme conditions @xmath67 and @xmath74 are not fulfilled , and the intermediate case takes place which is , nevertheless , more close to case of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . therefore , since the intermediate case takes place , the experimental dependences can be fitted by the function @xmath83 which is the superposition of function @xmath84 of type ( [ eq2 ] ) and @xmath85 of type ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath39 is the weighting factor .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that for the mixed crystals close to znp@xmath2 , i.e. at @xmath86 , the experimental dependence of the half - width of @xmath61-line on @xmath3 is fitted by function ( [ eq2 ] ) rather well , and the contribution of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) is rather small ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the situation is quite different for the mixed crystals close to znas@xmath2 , i.e. at @xmath41 , as the contribution of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) is considerably larger ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "it is rather simple to understand , as the bohr radius of b - exciton in znas@xmath2 is about two times larger than in znp@xmath2 .",
    "so , in znp@xmath2 the condition @xmath67 is fulfilled better than in znas@xmath2 . for the dependence of the half - width of @xmath45-lines on @xmath3 we have the quite opposite situation . for the mixed crystals close to znp@xmath2 , the experimental dependence of the half - width of @xmath45-line on @xmath3 deviates considerably from function ( [ eq2 ] ) , and",
    "the contribution of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) is rather large ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "for the mixed crystals close to znas@xmath2 , the contribution of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) to the fitting function is quite small ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the bohr radius of a - exciton , as we have noted above , almost does not differ in znp@xmath2 and znas@xmath2 .",
    "so , as the contribution of function ( [ eq3 ] ) at @xmath41 is smaller than at @xmath86,the condition @xmath67 is fulfilled better for a - exciton in the crystals close to znas@xmath2 .",
    "thus , we can make a conclusion of larger effective size of area of the crystal potential fluctuation in crystals close to znas@xmath2 , than in ones close to znp@xmath2 .",
    "the comparison studies of the low - temperature absorption , reflection and photoluminescence spectra of zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 and zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals have been performed at small levels of substitution of @xmath22 by @xmath23 : @xmath9 . respective spectra of zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 are presented in fig .",

    "one can see from the figure , that in the zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals the same excitonic c- , b- and a - series are observed , as well as in pure znp@xmath2 and mixed zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2crystals .",
    "one can see from absorption and reflection spectra that , likely to zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 , already at rather small @xmath3 only the excitonic states with @xmath34 are observed clearly in the spectra of zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals .",
    "the higher components of exciton spectra disappear , and the lines with @xmath34 broaden . in pl spectra , at the increase of @xmath3 the emission lines of both free and localized excitons broaden . as noted above ( see sect .  [ sec1 ] ) , all these effects are due to the fluctuations of crystal potential and corresponding fluctuations of the parameters of energy bands .",
    "likely to zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 , an effect of considerable increase of intensity of pl spectra at the increase of @xmath3 takes place in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals too .",
    "an explanation of such an effect is given as well in sect .",
    "[ sec1 ] .    in spite of the fact that the cdp@xmath2 crystal has larger energy gap than the znp@xmath2 , likely to zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 there is a decrease of the energy gap of zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals at the increase of @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ) .",
    "but the decrease of @xmath7 in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 is much slower . and",
    "besides the similarity in dependences of @xmath35 , both zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 and zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals have the similarity in the dependences of the rydbergs of excitons on @xmath3 as well ( see fig . [ fig5](b ) ) .",
    "the rydbergs of all the three a- , b- , and c - series decrease at the increase of @xmath3 .",
    "but , also likely to the dependence @xmath35 , the excitonic rydbergs in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 decrease considerably slower than in zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2",
    ". considerably weaker dependences of the energy gap and the rydbergs on @xmath3 in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 are , most probably , the results of the weaker changes in parameters of the energy bands , in particular in effective masses of electrons and holes , and in dielectric constant .",
    "but , at higher @xmath3 one can expect the more interesting and stronger changes in the parameters of energy bands and excitonic states with regard to the fact that cdp@xmath2 and znp@xmath2 have the different symmetry of lattice , and that cdp@xmath2 is indirect - gap semiconductor .",
    "the dependences of half - widths of absorption @xmath61- and @xmath45-lines on @xmath3 have been also studied in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 crystals .",
    "the results of comparison of such dependences with ones observed for zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 are presented in fig .",
    "one can see that @xmath76 dependences for both types of the mixed crystals are similar for exciton @xmath61-line .",
    "this dependences are described rather well by the function of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) type , contributions of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) are quite small for both type crystals : the weighting factor is @xmath87 for zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 and @xmath91 for zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 .",
    "it is an evidence that in both cases the effective size of area of the crystal potential fluctuation @xmath92 is rather large comparing to the exciton bohr radius @xmath93 .",
    "likely to zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 , in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 the dependence of half - width of @xmath45-line on @xmath3 deviates strongly from the function ( [ eq2 ] ) , the contribution of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) is large .",
    "as we assumed above , it is the result of the fact that a - exciton has considerably lower binding energy comparing to b - exciton , and larger bohr radius correspondingly .",
    "so , the condition @xmath67 is not fulfilled , and the dependence @xmath76 is not described by the function ( [ eq2 ] ) . at the same time",
    ", there are two remarkable features of @xmath76 dependence for @xmath45-line in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 .",
    "first one is the considerable deviations of the experimental points from the fitting function .",
    "it is quite remarkable as such deviations are very small for the @xmath76 dependences for @xmath45-line in zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 and for @xmath61-line in the mixed crystals of both types .",
    "second one is the fact that the contribution of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) is determinative in the fitting function : the weighting factor of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) is @xmath94 . for zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2",
    "the contribution of the function ( [ eq3 ] ) in the fitting function is considerably smaller : @xmath89 . at present moment , both above features of @xmath76 dependence for @xmath45-line in zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 are obscure .",
    "thus , a comparison of the energy bands and exciton parameters behaviour versus @xmath3 reveals as similar tendencies and different ones .",
    "in conclusion , we have obtained the following results . we have found that , likely to `` pure '' znp@xmath2 crystal , both in zn(p@xmath0as@xmath1)@xmath2 and zn@xmath0cd@xmath1p@xmath2 mixed crystals the same three excitonic hydrogenlike series ( c , b , and a ) are observed . at the increase of @xmath3 in the range of small @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) the decrease of the energy gap and exciton rydbergs takes place .",
