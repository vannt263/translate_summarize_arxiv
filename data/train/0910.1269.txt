    "high energy neutrinos are considered optimal probes to identify the sources of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "many indications suggest that cosmic objects , where acceleration of charged particles takes place , should also produce high energy gamma ray and neutrino fluxes .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 or @xmath2 interactions responsible for @xmath3 tev neutrinos and @xmath4 rays , are expected to occur in several astrophysical environments such as supernova remnants , microquasars , gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei @xcite . for many sources the neutrino flux , produced in the decay chains due to charge pions ,",
    "is expected to be similar to the flux of high - energy gamma rays of hadronic origin , which can be measured by tev gamma ray telescopes such as magic @xcite , hess @xcite and veritas @xcite .",
    "because of the low expected neutrino fluxes from galactic and extragalactic sources @xcite , the effective opening of the high energy neutrino astronomy era can really be made with detectors of km@xmath0 scale .",
    "after the success of the first generation of underwater / ice neutrino telescopes , such as baikal @xcite and amanda @xcite , the construction of the first km@xmath0 telescope , icecube , @xcite started at the south pole .",
    "the detector is announced to be completed by 2011 . in the mediterranean sea",
    ", the antares telescope is taking data since 2006 in a partial configuration and since 2008 in its full set - up @xcite .",
    "the antares collaboration together with the nestor @xcite and nemo @xcite collaborations are conducting an intense r&d activity for the future km@xmath0 mediterranean telescope .",
    "recently the three collaborations joined their efforts to design the km3net undersea infrastructure that will host a km@xmath0 telescope ; its construction is expected to start by 2013 @xcite .",
    "the activity of the nemo collaboration was mainly focused on the search and characterization of an optimal site for the detector installation and on the development of key technologies for the km@xmath0 underwater telescope to be installed in the mediterranean sea .",
    "a deep sea site with optimal features in terms of depth and water optical properties was identified at a depth of 3500 m about 80 km off - shore from capo passero ( southern cape of sicily ) .",
    "a long term monitoring of the site has been carried out @xcite .",
    "an other effort of the nemo collaboration was the definition of a feasibility study of the km@xmath0 detector , which included the analysis of the construction and installation issues and the optimization of the detector geometry by means of numerical simulations .    to ensure an adequate process of validation of the proposed solutions ,",
    "a technological demonstrator was built and installed off - shore the port of catania ( sicily , italy ) .",
    "this project , called nemo phase-1 , allowed the test and the qualification of the key technological elements ( mechanics , electronics , data transmission , power distribution , acoustic positioning and time calibration system ) proposed for the km@xmath0 detector @xcite . some of the technical solutions , further developed within the km3net consortium , have been proposed for the km@xmath0 detector construction .    in this paper , after a detailed description of the nemo phase-1 lay - out and operation , we focus on the atmospheric muon data analysis procedure and present the main results . in particular , the atmospheric muon angular distribution was measured and compared with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the vertical muon flux was determined from the angular distribution , computing the related depth intensity relation .",
    "results were compared with theoretical predictions and with results of other experiments .",
    "the nemo phase-1 apparatus is composed of two main elements : the mini - tower and the junction box ( jb ) interconnected as sketched in fig . [ fig : ts ] and described in the following .",
    "nemo phase-1 was installed between 10 and 19 december 2006 at the underwater test site of the laboratori nazionali del sud , off shore catania at a depth of 2080 m , latitude : 37@xmath5 33 4 \" n and longitude : 15@xmath5 23 2  e ( fig .",
    "[ fig : testsite ] ) .",
    "the operation was conducted with the cable layer vessel teliri @xcite .",
    "the jb and the tower were deployed from the sea surface by means of a winch and positioned on the seabed with an accuracy of a few meters .",
    "the jb was then connected to the main cable termination and the tower to the jb with electro - optical links equipped with wet mateable hybrid connectors .",
    "the connection operations were performed with an underwater remotely operated vehicle ( rov ) .",
    "the operation was completed with the successful unfurling of the tower that assumed the correct configuration .",
    "all active elements , such as pmts , electronics , acoustic positioning , data transmission and acquisition , worked correctly .    after four weeks of successful operation ,",
    "two problems were encountered , which prevented a fully efficient exploitation of the apparatus .",
    "firstly , a loss of buoyancy of the main buoy of the mini - tower occurred , which caused a slow sinking of the whole tower ; this problem was later ascribed to a poor manufacturing process of the buoy . then , about four months after the connection , the optical fiber transmission started to show a significant attenuation at the jb level .",
    "the jb was recovered in june 2007 .",
    "after tests in a hyperbaric chamber , the problem was identified in a faulty optical penetrator .",
    "the problem was solved by bypassing the connector with a redesign of the optical system lay - out .",
    "the jb was re - installed in april 2008 and proved to work correctly .    in spite of these problems ,",
    "the nemo phase-1 allowed to validate a number of technical solutions for the km@xmath0 telescope and to demonstrate the capability of the nemo tower to detect and track muons . during 5 months of operation",
    "about 500 gb of data were recorded .",
    "the jb provided connection between the main electro - optical cable and the detector structures and was designed to host and protect from the effects of corrosion and pressure the opto - electronic boards dedicated to the distribution and the control of the power supply and digitized signals .",
    "the nemo phase-1 jb was built following the concept of double containment .",
    "pressure resistant steel vessels were hosted inside a large fiberglass container , filled with silicon oil and pressure compensated .",
    "this solution has the advantage to decouple the two problems of pressure and corrosion resistance .",
    "all the electronics components that were proven able to withstand high pressure were installed directly in the oil bath @xcite .",
    "the jb was equipped with 6 ( 2 inputs and 4 outputs ) hybrid electro - optical wet mateable bulkheads .",
    "the two inputs were connected , by means of two underwater cables , to the two outputs of the termination frame of the main electro - optical cable , while one of the four available outputs of the jb was used to connect the mini - tower by means of a 300 m electro - optical link .",
    "the jb was equipped with a hv transformer and switches to distribute power to the output connectors , and with a system of optical couplers to connect the fibers from the input to the output connectors .",
    "the mini - tower was a small - size prototype of the nemo tower @xcite .",
    "it was a three dimensional flexible structure composed by a sequence of four horizontal elements ( _ floors _ ) interlinked by a system of tensioning ropes and anchored on the seabed .",
    "the structure was kept vertical by an appropriate buoyancy on the top .",
    "the storey was a 15 m long structure supporting two optical modules ( oms ) , one down - looking and one horizontally looking , at each end : four oms were installed on each storey .",
    "each floor was connected to the following one by means of four ropes arranged in such a way to force each floor to a position perpendicular to its vertical neighbors .",
    "the floors were vertically spaced by 40 m. an additional spacing of 100 m was present between the tower base and the lowermost floor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : torre ] ) .",
    "in addition to the 16 oms the instrumentation installed on the mini - tower included several sensors for calibration and environmental monitoring : an acoustic doppler current profiler ( rd instruments workhorse adcp ) to measure water current ; a light transmissometer ( wetlabs c * ) to measure water transparency ; a conductivity  temperature  depth probe ( sea - bird electronics 37-sm microcat ctd ) to monitor sea water properties ; a pair of hydrophones on each floor and on the tower base for acoustic positioning .",
    "a scheme of the instrumentation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] .",
    "the nemo tower was designed to be assembled in a compact configuration , also kept during the transport and the deployment , which was performed from a surface vessel by means of a winch .",
    "after the positioning on the seabed and the connection to the undersea cable network , the tower was unfurled thanks to the pull provided by the buoy .",
    "this procedure was actuated remotely from the surface vessel by means of an acoustic device .",
    "each optical module used for the nemo phase-1 detector was composed by a pmt enclosed in a 17 `` pressure resistant sphere of thick glass .",
    "the pmt was a 10 '' hamamatsu r7081sel with 10 stages @xcite . in spite of its large photocathode area",
    ", this pmt has a good time resolution , about 3 ns fwhm for single photoelectron pulses , with a charge resolution of 35% .",
    "mechanical and optical contact between the pmt and the internal glass surface was ensured by an optical silicon gel .",
    "a @xmath6-metal cage shielded the pmt from the earth magnetic field .",
    "the base card circuit for the high voltage distribution ( iseg phq 7081sel ) required only a low voltage supply ( + 5 vdc ) and generated all necessary voltages for cathode , grid and dynodes with a power consumption of less than 150 mw .",
    "a front - end electronics module ( fem ) , built with discrete components @xcite , was also placed inside the om . the fem performed sampling at 200 mhz by means of two 100 mhz staggered flash adcs , whose outputs were `` captured '' by a field programmable gate array ( fpga )",
    ". the fpga performed threshold discrimination , stored it with an event time stamp in an internal 16 kbit fifo , packed om data and local slow control information and coded everything into a bit stream frame ready to be transmitted on a twisted pair at 20 mb / s .",
    "the main features of this solution are the moderate power consumption , the high resolution and the large input dynamics range obtained by a quasi - logarithmic analog compression circuit , with a raw time resolution of 5 ns .",
    "the fem board digitized and sent pulse waveform information up to a maximum pulse rate of @xmath7150 khz .",
    "the fem board was also equipped with analog and digital electronics to control the om power supply and to monitor the operating conditions , such of temperature , humidity and electrical parameters .",
    "it could also perform a calibration of the non linear response of the logarithmic compressor .",
    "in addition , the board provided an estimate of the average count rate by counting the number of hits with amplitude exceeding a threshold of 0.3 single photo - electron ( s.p.e . ) in a 10 ms time window as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : pmtrates ] .",
    "this estimate did not suffer from the limitation of the data transfer process and allowed to measure the signal rate up to 6.5 mhz .",
    "the design of the data acquisition system for nemo phase-1 was based on technical choices that allow scalability to a much larger apparatus @xcite .",
    "the optical connection between the counting room facilities on - shore and the detector under water was driven by pairs of twin electronic boards , called floor control module ( fcm ) , located at both extremities of each optical link , and deputed to manage either the om data stream , from off - shore to on - shore , and the slow control commands , sent in the opposite direction .",
    "each fcm board was powered by a floor power module ( fpm ) lodged on the corresponding floor , and was connected to the tower base module ( tbm ) through an optical fiber backbone .",
    "the tbm was connected through an inter - link cable to the jb .",
    "a detailed description of the mini - tower electronics is given in @xcite .",
    "the om data acquisition worked as follows : each off - shore fcm multiplexed the signal produced by the corresponding four om - fem pairs in a floor , converted them from electric to optical and sent it on - shore through the optical link .",
    "each on - shore fcm , hosted on a dedicated server , de - multiplexed the incoming data and distributed it to the trigger and data acquisition system , which was composed of the mastercpu server , for data filtering , and a post - trigger data storage facility .",
    "each on - shore server was connected to the others via a standard 1 gigabit ethernet network .    in order to reconstruct muon tracks using the erenkov technique , a common timing",
    "must be known in the whole apparatus at the level of each detection device to allow time correlation of events .",
    "for this reason a synchronous and fixed latency protocol , which embedded data and clock timing in the same serial bit stream , was used for communications between onshore and offshore .",
    "the implemented system relied on dense wavelength division multiplex ( dwdm ) techniques , using totally passive components with the only exception of the line termination devices , i.e. electro - optical transceivers .",
    "the precision of the common timing of the apparatus was measured and monitored using a dedicated time calibration system , as illustrated in the next subsection .",
    "the time calibration was performed with an embedded system to track the possible drifts of the time offsets during the operations of the apparatus underwater @xcite .",
    "this system measured the offsets with which the local time counters inside the optical modules were reset on reception of the reset commands broadcasted from shore .",
    "the operation was performed with a redundant system : ( 1 ) a two - step procedure for measuring the offsets in the time measurements of the optical sensors and ( 2 ) an all - optical procedure for measuring the differences in the time offsets of the different optical modules .    in the first system",
    "the needed measurements were performed in two separate steps : using an  echo \" timing calibration and using an  optical \" timing calibration .",
    "the former allowed the measurement of the time delay for the signal propagation from the shore to the fcm of each floor ; the latter , based on a network of optical fibres which distributes calibration signals from fast light pulsers to the oms , allowed to determine the time offsets between the fcm and each optical module connected to it .    the second system was an extension of the optical timing calibration system , which allowed to simultaneously calibrate the optical modules of different floors of the tower .",
    "another key requirement for the muon tracking with an underwater cherenkov apparatus is the knowledge of each optical sensor position .",
    "while the position and orientation of the tower base was fixed and known from its installation , the rest of the structure could bend under the influence of sea currents .",
    "a precise determination of the position of each tower floor was achieved by means of triangulations performed by measuring the propagation times of acoustic signals between a long - base - line ( lbl ) of acoustic beacons , placed on the sea floor , and a couple of hydrophones ( labeled h0 and h1 ) installed on each tower floor close to the positions of the optical modules .",
    "the inclination and orientation of each tower floor was also measured by a tiltmeter - compass board placed inside the fcm .",
    "the lbl was realized with four stand - alone battery - powered acoustic beacons and one additional beacon located on the tower base ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aco ] ) .        to recognize the beacon pulses a technique called time spectral spread codes ( tssc ) was used .",
    "each beacon transmitted a unique pattern of 6 pseudo - random pulses ( spaced by 1 s ) .",
    "the duration of each pulse was 5 ms and the sequence of pulses was built to avoid overlap between consecutive pulses . in this way a typical beacon pulse sequence was recognized without ambiguity and all the beacons could transmit their characteristic pulse sequence at the same acoustic frequency .",
    "this was an advantage since all beacons could be identical except for the software configuration that defines the pulse sequence ; the receivers were then sensitive to the 32 khz acoustic channel . since the beacon clocks were autonomous , in order to determine the position of the hydrophones , the lbl had to be synchronized to the master clock of the apparatus .",
    "this synchronisation took place acoustically using a monitoring station , formed by two hydrophones , connected to the mini - tower data acquisition system , placed in correspondence to the tower base . prior to the connection of the mini - tower ,",
    "the four acoustic beacons providing the lbl were deployed around the apparatus at an approximate distance of 250 m from the tower base . in order to obtain the required accuracy of @xmath815 cm - comparable with the size of the pmt - the time of flight of acoustic signals between the lbl beacons and the monitoring station had to be evaluated with an accuracy of the order of 10@xmath9 sec . to achieve this goal",
    "an accurate calibration of the lbl was performed , taking into account the clock drift of the stand - alone beacons . in particular , the absolute positions of the beacons and their relative distances were determined , acoustically , at the time of detector installation , using a rov equipped with a 32 khz , gps synchronized pinger and with a high accuracy pressure sensor .",
    "all the slow control data ( including data from all environmental sensors and the acoustic positioning system ) were managed from shore by means of a dedicated slow control management system @xcite and analyzed as described in the following .",
    "the lbl calibration procedure allowed the determination of distances between the beacons and the monitoring station , and to calculate the time of flight of the acoustic pulses as the difference between the time of arrival of the acoustic signal on each hydrophone and the time of emission of the beacon .",
    "the sound velocity was calculated using the ctd data .",
    "the time of emission of the beacon pulse , in the common detector clock reference time , was obtained measuring the time of arrival of this pulse at the monitoring station .",
    "this procedure allowed to compensate for the clock drift of the stand - alone beacons ( about 20 ns / s ) during the livetime of the apparatus . in order to merge in post - processing the acoustic positions data together with optical module detection information , both were time stamped with a universal time reference tag .",
    "the acoustic positioning system data were extensively analyzed .",
    "the tower positions were reconstructed and the movements were measured as a function of time , on long and short time scales @xcite .    in order to estimate the accuracy of the positioning system , the distances between hydrophones h0 and h1 on the same floor were measured . in fig.[fig : accuracy ] the distance h0-h1 measured for floor 2 is shown .",
    "this result indicates that the obtained accuracy in the determination of hydrophone positions is better than 10 cm .",
    "february h.17 to 1@xmath10 february h.23 ( 6 hours ) .",
    "the mean value of the measured distance is 14.24 @xmath11 0.06 m ( dashed line ) .",

    "the pmt counting rates gave an instantaneous estimate of the optical background during the detector livetime .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] the histogram of the rate distribution is plotted for a pmt located on the 4@xmath12 floor , in the time interval between 10 and 20 january 2007 .",
    "the histogram shows a peak in the 75 - 80 khz interval due to @xmath13k decay plus a contribution due to diffuse bioluminescence @xcite .",
    "the frequency value at the peak , commonly called the _ baseline _ of the optical background @xcite , was determined fitting the peak of the distribution with a gaussian function .",
    "the baseline obtained from the fit is 72.5@xmath113.6 khz .",
    "the distribution , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] , shows also a tail extending to several hundreds khz due to intense bioluminescence bursts .",
    "this contribution is measured by means of the so - called _ burst fraction _ and it was calculated , for comparison with the antares detector data in two different ways @xcite :    * the percentage of time in which the rate exceeds 200 khz ; * the percentage of time in which the rate exceeds 1.2 times the baseline rate value .    for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] , the percentage of time with rates exceeding 200 khz was 0.3% while the percentage of time with rates larger than 1.2 times the baseline rate was 2.6% .",

    "typical results , for an om located in the 4@xmath12 mini - tower floor , are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ratevstime ] .",
    "the data indicate two time intervals with different characteristics of the optical background",
    ". the first period , from the detector activation to the first week of february 2007 , was characterized by a baseline rate of @xmath14 khz and a burst fraction of the order of a few percents ( with peaks up to 20% ) while the second one , starting approximately on february 11 , characterized by a slightly lower baseline rate ( average @xmath15 khz ) and a higher burst fraction ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these results can be explained as due to two effects : a change of the water properties and a change in the detector configuration due to the loss of buoyancy of the tower .",
    "starting from february 2007 , in fact , the detector fell down by about 40 meters ; thus the 4@xmath12 floor was at about 80 meters from the sea bottom .",
    "on the other hand during the same period of time we observed an increase of the underwater currents @xcite , and as shown by the antares collaboration @xcite , the level of bioluminescence is usually correlated with the value of the sea current .",
    "the somehow contradictory decrease of the baseline can be explained as a consequence of the increase of water turbidity , due to particulate , close to the bottom and under the effect of the increased current .",

    "in order to reconstruct atmospheric muon tracks and to measure the muon flux a dedicated data selection and analysis procedure was applied . the atmospheric muon track analysis was implemented for a limited period of the detector livetime , shown by the shaded area in fig .",

    "an on - line data selection algorithm was implemented to select muon events among the optical background .",
    "since the main contribution to optical noise was due to uncorrelated pmts hits -with an average rate of about 70 khz- the selection criterion ( hereafter trigger seed ) consisted in imposing time coincidence in a narrow time - window of 20 ns among hits occurred on pairs of adjacent pmts ( i.e. the two pmts located at the same extremity of the same floor ) .",
    "this trigger seed is called _ simple coincidence _ ( sc ) .    when an sc trigger occurred , the data acquired by all the pmts within a _ triggered time window _ ( ttw ) , centered around the sc time , were stored on file and identified as possible muon event for off - line data analysis . if another trigger seed occurred in the ttw after the first one , the ttw itself was extended by @xmath17 after the new seed time .    in order to test the on - line selection algorithm , two different lengths of the ttw",

    "sec : results ] ) .",
    "therefore , a further off - line data selection , with more complex and more selective algorithms , too slow for the requirements of the on - line trigger , was necessary .",
