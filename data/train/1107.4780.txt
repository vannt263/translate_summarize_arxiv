    "one of the most successful theories in solid - state physics is the density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "its present implementations predict properties of materials with an accuracy , which makes it a standard tool for material scientists both in fundamental research and in industry .",
    "one of the major deficiencies of currently available density functionals is the description of materials with strong electron correlations .",
    "strong electron correlations develop when the interaction between the electrons dominates over the kinetic energy . while the kinetic energy favors delocalized electron states and well - defined energy bands in reciprocal space , strong interactions may lead to a complete breakdown of the band picture .",
    "strongly correlated materials often contain 3d transition - metal elements or rare - earth elements with partially filled f - electron shells .",
    "the d- and f - electrons are on the one hand localized core - like states , but , on the other hand , they are located energetically in the region of valence states . thus , their nature is right at the border between localized and delocalized behavior .",
    "strong correlations are responsible for a wealth of new properties with potential technological relevance . among them",
    "are heavy - fermion systems@xcite , mott insulators and the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition ( mhmit)@xcite , high - temperature superconductors@xcite and the colossal magnetoresistance@xcite .",
    "more recently , the vicinity to phase transitions in those systems has opened the field of quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "it is a fascinating challenge to unravel the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena and eventually to rationally design applications exploiting them .",
    "a theoretical treatment of these systems , however , turns out to be a rather big challenge and has been at the frontier of research in condensed matter physics since nearly half a century.@xcite the use of explicit many - body tools is nearly impossible for complex materials like perovskites .",
    "therefore , the many - body community tries to identify the minimal set of degrees of freedom relevant for the physical properties and sets up a model hamiltonian for these degrees of freedom .",
    "the best known of these models is the hubbard model @xcite , which has been the working horse for correlation effects in transition metal compounds for almost 50 years .",
    "a first attempt to combine dft with techniques from many - body theory was made with the gw method @xcite , which supplements dft with certain classes of feynman diagrams .",
    "while the gw scheme was applied to semi - conductors with some success @xcite , it still fails to describe the physics of the mhmit .",
    "a partial success along this line was achieved by the so - called lda+u approach , which complements the density functionals by hartree - fock type local correlations@xcite .",
    "hybrid density functionals@xcite , which replace part of the exchange energy with the exact non - local exchange energy , capture essentially the same physics .",
    "these functionals lead to a large improvement of the band gaps , and transition - metal oxides appear correctly as antiferromagnetic charge - transfer insulators , where conventional gga - type functionals erroneously predict metals or a small d - d band gap.@xcite it is , however , important to emphasize that within lda+u one can only describe materials with ordered ground states satisfactorily , while the mhmit in the paramagnetic state , as in v@xmath0o@xmath1 , can not be explained with this method .",
    "a quantum leap in the understanding of the mhmit was achieved by the invention of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , which provides an efficient and reliable tool to approximately solve the correlation problem for hubbard type models with local interactions @xcite .",
    "dmft keeps the local dynamics intact , which turns out to be essential for the mhmit .",
    "hence , this theory can actually describe the competition between the fermi liquid and the interaction driven insulator@xcite , and also allows for the inclusion of ordered phases beyond standard hartree theory @xcite .",
    "the price to pay is the neglect of non - local physics and that dmft fails to capture phenomena like unconventional superconductivity or quantum criticality based on spatial fluctuations @xcite .",
    "note , however , that these effects can be re - included to a certain extent by extending the original theory @xcite    rather soon it was realized , that the dmft can be combined with dft in a fashion similar to gw.@xcite indeed , early successes of the method comprise the proper description of spectral properties of @xmath2sr , ca@xmath3vo@xmath1 , the mhmit in v@xmath0o@xmath1 , the energetics of the volume collapse in cerium @xcite , and the lattice properties of plutonium @xcite , to name a few .",
    "however , as the dmft is model - hamiltonian based , it requires the definition of a hubbard model prior to its application .",
    "this means , that one needs to extract from dft ( i ) the hopping parameters of the hubbard model and ( ii ) the local coulomb parameters .",
    "both are highly ill - defined quantities , because the results strongly depend on the basis set and the sub - manifold of orbitals taken into account . here",
    ", a large effort has been put forward during the past years to define a fairly universal interface between the wave - function based dft and the green function based dmft @xcite .",
    "besides these technical problems , there are further caveats of the method .",
    "firstly , the dft does already include certain correlation effects .",
    "these have to be `` subtracted '' from the dft prior to the calculation of tight - binding and interaction parameters to avoid double - counting in the dmft calculation .",
    "this subtle aspect is one of the most challenging problems in the combination of dft and dmft so far , because nobody knows to what extent and in what form in the diagrammatic language correlations effects are included in dft and how to actually properly remove them @xcite .",
    "secondly , within a many - body formulation , the interactions within the subspace of the correlated orbitals will be screened by the other electronic degrees of freedom in the spirit of gw @xcite .",
    "this means , that the actual interactions become retarded .",
    "this poses a serious challenge for the computational tools necessary to solve the effective quantum impurity model arising within dmft .    and",
    "last , but not least , the combination of dft and dmft can not be put rigorously on a variational basis .",
    "one can , in principle , formulate an extremal principle @xcite involving both wave function for dft and green functions for dmft , but the actual connection between these two worlds and a proper subtraction of double counting terms is not obvious .",
    "therefore , a method , which is fully variational and allows to include both correlations as they are described by conventional density functionals and a reasonable and controlled approximation for strong local correlations , is clearly desirable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose such an approach .",
    "the guiding idea is to reformulate the variational problem in terms of the one - particle density matrix , which is known as reduced - density - matrix functional theory ( rdmft ) .",
    "this problem is of the same complexity as a complete many - particle calculation .",
    "therefore we introduce a local approximation to avoid the dimensional bottleneck .",
    "the origin of rdmft goes back to gilbert s theorem@xcite .",
    "gilbert proved that every ground - state observable can be written as a functional of the one - particle density matrix .",
    "analogously to the development in the field of density - functional theory , research is directed towards the formulation of approximate density - matrix functionals .",
    "most applications use a variation of mller s functional@xcite .",
    "recent functionals have been able to describe the mott band gap of transition metal oxides within a non - magnetic description@xcite , while density functionals tend to form antiferromagnets instead .",
    "this problem is related to the broken - symmetry states of dft .    in this paper , we explore the main principles of the method .",
    "we do not yet approach the question on how to exploit the local nature of the interaction in the anderson impurity models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section  [ sec : theory ]",
    ", we present the formulation of the theory in detail . in section  [ sec : ci ] , we sketch the evaluation of the reduced - density - matrix functional using a dynamical optimization similar to the car - parrinello method@xcite .",
    "the workings of our theory will be explored in section  [ sec : model ] , where its results for short hubbard chains are compared with rigorous many - particle calculations .",
    "while our goal is to incorporate many - particle effects into a general electronic structure method such as the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method method@xcite , the first step will be to map the electronic structure onto a basisset of local spin orbitals @xmath4 .",
    "the spin coordinate @xmath5 can assume the values spin - up and spin - down .",
    "each orbital is a two - component spinor , even though we may choose the orbitals such that they only have one non - zero spin component .    in order to decompose an arbitrary one - particle wave function @xmath6 into the contribution of the orbitals @xmath7 according to @xmath8 we introduce so - called projector states @xmath9 .",
    "the projector states @xmath10 obey the bi - orthogonality condition @xmath11 the identity eq .",
    "[ eq : decomposelo ] is valid whenever the wave function can be expanded completely into the orbital set . for a complete orthonormal basisset of local orbitals ,",
    "the projector states can also be chosen identical to the local orbitals . however , in the most general form , the projector functions differ from the orbitals .    the projector states @xmath9 are conceptually related to the projector functions of the paw method@xcite .",
    "they differ from those used for the augmentation , because they provide the amplitudes of the local orbitals instead of partial waves amplitudes provided by the latter",
    ". however , in the paw method the projector states @xmath9 for the local orbitals are naturally constructed as superposition of the projector states for the partial waves .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators in terms of local orbitals can be expressed by the field operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 via @xmath14 the back transform is @xmath15    creation and annihilation operators obey the anti - commutator relation @xmath16_+&=&\\langle\\pi_\\alpha|\\pi_\\beta\\rangle \\\\",

    "thus , it can not be obtained in an independent - electron picture .    in order to compare our results with the independent - electron picture",
    ", we performed calculations based on a static mean - field theory . to generate a static mean - field description within our density - matrix functional framework",
    ", one simply has to replace @xmath100 $ ] in eq .",
    "[ eq : modelenergy ] by the expression @xmath101=u\\rho_{r\\uparrow , r\\uparrow}\\rho_{r\\downarrow , r\\downarrow}$ ] .",
    "the ground state in the mean - field approximation is a single slater determinant . for small interaction strengths ,",
    "the wave function is formed from the two bonding orbitals and the electrons remain uncorrelated . as a consequence the total energy raises with constant slope with the interaction strength . at approximately @xmath102 ,",
    "the mean - field ground - state wave function undergoes a transition to an anti - ferromagnetic state .",
    "as in a typical second order transition , the magnetization grows with an approximate square - root behavior away from the transition . in the large - u limit , each site has the magnetic moment of one electron .",
    "the anti - ferromagnetic state is a so - called broken - symmetry state , which is not an eigenstate of the total spin . for the dimer",
    ", such a broken - symmetry state can be described as a superposition of a singlet and a triplet state .",
    "the true ground state , however , is a pure singlet , because only the singlet state can profit from some remaining covalency .",
    "another interesting quantity for the hubbard model is the double occupancy , defined as @xmath103 . in the hubbard model , the interaction energy depends exclusively on the sum of the double occupancies .    in our theory",
    ", we extract the double occupancy of a given site from the anderson impurity model with the interaction at that site .",
    "hence , the double occupancy is calculated for each site from a different anderson impurity model and thus from a different wave function .    the double occupancy for the 6-site hubbard chain is shown in figure [ fig : doubleoccupancy ] . the continuous suppression of the double occupancy with increasing interaction strength is well reproduced .",
    "also the difference between surface sites and the center of the chain is in agreement with the exact calculation .",
    "however , our theory tends to underestimate the double occupancy resulting in a somewhat steeper slope in the small - u limit .",
    "the large - u limit is well reproduced .",
    "the double occupancy provides clear evidence for the strength of the presented theory as compared to the mean - field theory . in the mean - field theory ,",
    "the double occupancy remains at @xmath104 until @xmath105 , from where it starts to decrease as the system builds up anti - ferromagnetic correlations . in the exact result , and in our approximation , the double occupancy starts to decrease as soon as the interaction is switched on .",
    "the failure of mean - field theory is due to its inability to produce the correct singlet ground state .",
    "while the anderson impurity models provide a local perspective and insight on electron correlations as they are present in the many - particle wave function , the density matrix provides the global perspective .",
    "the density matrix is fully described by a set of one - particle orbitals , the natural orbitals , and their occupations . while the natural orbitals are distinct from kohn - sham orbitals of density - functional theory , they provide similar type of information on the system .",
    "it is striking that the natural orbitals depend very little on the interaction strength as seen in figure  [ fig : natural_orbitals ] .",
    "qualitatively there is no difference and the quantitative changes are barely visible in this representation .",
    "natural orbitals of the 6-site hubbard chain for u=0 ( left ) and u / t=8 ( right ) .",
    "the radius of each sphere is proportional to the amplitude of the natural orbital , and the area is proportional to the site occupation .",
    "full and open circles represent the different signs of the orbital coefficients .",
    "the orbitals are arranged with decreasing occupation from bottom to top . for each spatial orbital",
    "shown , there are two spin orbitals . ]",
    "however , the interaction strength has a strong effect on the occupations as shown in figure  [ fig : eigenvalues_rho_ij ] .",
    "while the occupations in the ( non - degenerate ) ground state of a non - interacting system are always either zero or one , all occupations become fractional if the interaction is switched on . from a chemical point of view , the depopulation of bonding orbitals and the population of formerly unoccupied antibonding orbitals reflects the depression of the covalent interaction by the interaction . from a solid - state point of view , the behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvalues_rho_ij ] is reminiscent of the momentum distribution functions of a fermi - liquid or the luttinger liquid .",
    "while for noninteracting particles the momentum distribution has a sharp drop of the occupations from one to zero at the fermi momentum , for the interacting electron systemm , it exhibits a gradual decrease with either a drop of size @xmath106 , the quasi - particle renormalization factor of a fermi liquid , or , for a luttinger liquid , a sharp change with an algebraic singularity at the fermi momentum    the smearing out of the occupations implies that the number of one - particle wave functions to be considered must be larger than that required for density - functional theory .",
    "if we venture into an extrapolation of our findings to real systems , we expect that it will be necessary to include one - particle wave functions @xmath37 up to the antibonding orbitals of bonds for which left - right correlation is important .",
    "this implies that we need to include orbitals up to several electron volts above the fermi - level . working in our favor",
    "is that in the strongest bonds , with high - lying antibonding states , the kinetic energy is large and therefore dominating over the coulomb repulsion .",
    "correlations are dominant in relatively weak bonds , either when they are stretched to the dissociation limit , or when they involve d- and f - electron orbitals or @xmath107 bonds .",
    "one of the major problems plaguing density - functional calculations is the band - gap problem . here",
    ", we do not refer to the optical band gap , which is an excited state property and which , in a strict sense , is neither accessible by ground - state dft nor by our theory .",
    "instead we investigate here the thermodynamic gap , which we define as @xmath108 because @xmath109 is a series of line - segments interpolating between the values for integer particle numbers @xmath110 , this definition is identical to the more common expression @xmath111 , which is the difference @xmath112 between electron affinity @xmath113 and ionization potential @xmath114 . because @xmath109 is a true ground - state property , it should be properly described both by our theory and by correct density - functional theory .",
    "a failure of describing the thermodynamic gap has a fundamental impact on the defect chemistry in semiconductors and insulators .     versus filling @xmath115 from our theory ( spheres and dashed lines ) and the exact hubbard chain ( solid lines ) for the four - site ( left ) and the six - site ( right ) hubbard chains as function of the particle number for @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 from top to bottom .",
    "the dashed lines are a guide to the eye and connect the data points .",
    "( color online ) ]    the chemical potential @xmath119 for different interaction strengths calculated with our theory is shown in figure  [ fig : chemicalpotential ] and compared to the exact thermodynamic band gap , included as horizontal lines in the figure .",
    "it is obvious that our theory does not yield a discontinuity . despite of this",
    ", the value of the band band gap can nevertheless be obtained using slater s transition rule as @xmath120 from the difference of the chemical potentials at half - integer occupations .",
    "( first panel ) , @xmath117 ( second ) and @xmath118 ( third ) .",
    "symbols denote results from our theory , lines the exact behavior . ]    the failure to describe the discontinuity of the chemical potential , and thus the band gap , reminds of the behavior of approximate density - matrix functionals.@xcite these functionals do not make the local approximation , but use approximate numerical representations of the exchange correlation energy . also here , the discontinuity vanishes , while the band gap calculated with half - occupied orbitals are satisfactory predictions .    except for the non - interacting case , the total energy appears to be a continuous function of the particle number within our theory , while the exact result has jumps in the slope at integer fillings .",
    "we attribute this deficiency of our theory to its tendency to underestimate the total energy . as seen in figure  [ enl ]",
    "this underestimation is most prominent for fractional particle numbers at intermediate interaction strengths . for small or huge values of @xmath92",
    "the effect is less visible ; but here , too , the variation across integer fillings is smooth , as it is apparent from fig.[fig : chemicalpotential ] .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ app : underestimate ] this defect is related to the fact that the wave function for each anderson - impurity model is optimized individually .",
    "an approximation based on a common wave function for all sites may direct towards a remedy of this problem .",
    "we proposed a pathway to include explicit correlations into density - functional based calculations .",
    "the guiding ideas have been to develop a strict variational approximation of the interacting electron gas , that avoids the dimensional bottleneck of may - particle quantum theory , and that allows seamless incorporation into electronic structure methodology of density - functional theory .",
    "let us summarize what we have accomplished so far : based on a general formulation using a density - matrix - functional description of the solid , the many - particle problem for the lattice with the full interaction has been replaced by a collection of generalized multi - orbital anderson impurity models , defined through the functionals @xmath121 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx1 ] ) .",
    "these anderson impurity models are defined relative to the dft functional as accurate way to obtain the quasi - particle dispersion including effects of non - local correlations and proper screening .",
    "since the local dft contributions can be explicitly subtracted from the density - matrix functional , the problem of double counting can be treated without further assumptions in this approach . restricting the actual correlations to one site",
    "only has proven to be a powerful idea in many - particle schemes such as dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "we believe that the density - matrix functional approach plus local approximation as proposed in this paper , when properly implemented , will provide a tool to treat correlation effects in a spirit similar to dmft , however using the information of the density - matrix only .    as test case we applied our method to finite hubbard chains as simple model systems .",
    "the extremalization of the the density - matrix functional is done on the fly using an explicit constrained - search algorithm@xcite .",
    "this iterative approach has been solved by a dynamical approach inspired by the car - parrinello method .",
    "the iterative nature of the constrained - search algorithm holds promise to important cost reductions in an outer self - consistency loop .",
    "in contrast to static mean - field theory , our method produces at half filling the correct singlet state with strong anti - ferromagnetic correlations , and thus gives a qualitative description of left - right correlation .",
    "the local approximation smears out the band - gap , which has been observed similarly in approximate density - matrix functionals .",
    "the energy levels of the many - particle system are , however , well approximated using the chemical potentials half - integer particle numbers .",
    "presently , each of these anderson impurity models still represents a nontrivial many - particle problem on the infinite lattice .",
    "thus , apparently nothing has been gained so far regarding a calculation of physical properties in this approximation .",
    "the important next step now is to reformulate the effective quantum impurity problem in a way that it can be solved efficiently . in standard dmft the important aspect is that the actual lattice structure only enters through the density of states . as consequence , the solution of the effective quantum impurity problem can be done without ever resorting to the actual lattice .",
    "it is obviously important to develop a similar approach for the local density - matrix functional .",
    "the most straightforward idea here would be to treat the quantum impurity as open quantum system and apply techniques developed in this field to facilitate the creation of an efficient impurity solver for our theory .",

    "financial support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through spp1145 and for1346 is gratefully acknowledged .",
