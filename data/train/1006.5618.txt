    "cold atoms are a multipurpose tool for both fundamental observations and technological innovations .",
    "cooling and trapping of neutral atoms has led to many discoveries such as bose - einstein condensation  @xcite , atom interferometry  @xcite , atomic nanofabrication  @xcite and improved atomic clocks  @xcite .",
    "evaporative cooling in magnetic traps is an efficient tool for reaching high densities at low temperatures  @xcite , necessary for the observation of quantum many - body effects in dilute gases .",
    "it has been applied with success also to optically trapped gases  @xcite , as well as to the cooling of fermionic atoms via sympathetic cooling  @xcite . however ,",
    "for many applications it is not necessary or even desirable to reach quantum degeneracy .",
    "the external fields and atomic interactions can be harmful for ultraprecise measurements and atomic clocks , for which low temperatures coupled to low densities but large numbers of atoms are needed for a good signal - to - noise ratio and unperturbed atomic transition frequencies .",
    "evaporative cooling is rather wasteful on atoms , and it requires also a large cross - section of elastic collisions and strongly confining traps with velocity - selective output coupling . for quantum information purposes one has to target single atoms , and then cooling without collisional thermalization is needed .",
    "finally , the current interest in nanomechanics has stirred renewed interest on laser cooling  @xcite .",
    "we present an efficient raman cooling method , which allows one to reach subrecoil temperatures rapidly with purely optical means in 2d , with a simple pulse setup .",
    "the method is applicable to all densities and even single atoms , and can be combined with sympathetic cooling if necessary .    the original raman cooling idea was presented and verified experimentally by kasevich and chu in 1992 at stanford for na atoms in 1d  @xcite .",
    "the setup consists of a three - level @xmath2-type atom .",
    "a raman pulse ( two contra - propagating beams ) moves an atom from one state to another and at the same time gives it a velocity change of @xmath3 .",
    "the pulse duration and detunings are selected so that the two - photon raman process is suppressed for atoms with velocity near @xmath4 .",
    "the central frequency and duration of the subsequent pulses is adjusted to target different velocity groups while still avoiding @xmath4 .",
    "as atoms are optically pumped back to the original state after each pulse , they eventually accumulate at velocities near @xmath4 .",
    "the original work was later extended to 2d and 3d cooling  @xcite , without reaching subrecoil temperatures .",
    "the 1d scheme has been used in attempts to reach high 3d phase - space densities in optical traps  @xcite .",
    "the use of a dipole trap allowed subrecoil 3d cooling by ergodicity of the motion in the inverted pyramidal trap  @xcite or the simple anisotropy of a 3d harmonic trap  @xcite while applying the raman cooling only in 1d . similar work with cs atoms has been done at ens , paris  @xcite . whereas the original scheme used blackman pulses of finite spectral width , it was actually shown with levy flight simulations that for 2d and 3d the square pulses are quite efficient  @xcite .",
    "the key issue is that in the original scheme the direct raman cooling in 2d requires four raman beam pairs and can be quite cumbersome .",
    "the 2d scheme with square pulses was applied to cs atoms at nist , gaithersburg , giving temperatures down to 0.15@xmath5  @xcite , where @xmath5 is the atomic recoil temperature .",
    "this is actually the only demonstrated case of reaching subrecoil temperatures with true 2d raman cooling .",
    "we show that in the tripod system , one can go down in theory by an order of magnitude or even more , which means going down to @xmath6 .",
    "the scheme can also be used in transversal cooling of atomic beams , for example ne@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this presentation is such that we first derive the basic equations for the velocity changes induced by one cycle of raman pulses in the 2d tripod configuration .",
    "we show that in the limit of small effective interaction between ground states one can obtain simple solutions for the equations .",
    "then we extend the treatment to arbitrary interaction strength .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the efficiency of the method by solving the model numerically for an appropriate initial momentum distribution , including both the raman cycles as well as the optical pumping between them .",
