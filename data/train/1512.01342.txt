    "heavy quarkonia are the simplest particles when the strong interactions are concerned . studying their production mechanism is important for understanding qcd and the strong interaction dynamics . in theory , it is well - known that the dominant mechanism to produce a heavy quarkonium at large transverse momentum is fragmentation @xcite so this mechanism is described by the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) . in fact , the ff shows hadron production probability from the initial high - energy parton . the ffs are universal quantities so that are independent of the initial parton production processes .",
    "the particular importance of ffs is for model - independent predictions of the cross sections at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",

    "using the suzuki s model we gave out an analytical expression for the initial scale fragmentation functions of gluon to split into the spin - singlet and -triplet s - wave charmonium states .",
    "our results depend on the transverse momentum of the initial gluon whereas in other models the integrations over all freedom degrees are performed . since the transverse momentum dependent ffs show up explicitly in several semi - inclusive cross sections , therefore in the qcd corrections the inclusion of these dependent ffs will be necessary .",
    "+ we discussed that there are three different scenarios to impose the spin effects of heavy quarkonia into the gluon ffs and we presented the fragmentation functions in each three scenarios .",
    "the results show that the fragmentation probability of the gluon into the spin - triplet bound - state is the biggest one . however , at present there are no experimental data for the heavy quarkonium fragmentation but a comparison between the treatment of the gluon ffs in figs .  [ fig3 ] ,",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] with the @xmath157 @xcite and @xmath162 @xcite ffs can confirm the correctness of our derived results .",
    "our results can be directly used for the s - wave bottomonium sates ( @xmath163-system ) , with some simple replacements .                    s.  m.  m.  nejad and a.  armat , eur .",
