    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) is the most studied scenario beyond the sm , and the lightest neutralino is a favourite candidate for dark matter ( dm ) , when r - parity is conserved .",

    "currently the attention has shifted towards simplified models @xcite , where only few degrees of freedom , such as the neutralino mass and the mass splitting to the lightest susy particles , define the relevant phenomenology . in this study , we investigate the implications of monojet searches in the context of the simplified models in the mssm with neutralino dm by reinterpreting the lhc run  1 results in a quantitative way , and compare them to the constraints obtained from direct susy searches in the jet / lepton + met channels .",
    "the lack of signals of low energy susy in the lhc run  1 data already sets strong constraints on the mass spectrum of the susy particles , in the constrained mssm models .",
    "more general mssm scenarios with less ad - hoc universality assumptions , such as the phenomenological mssm ( pmssm )  @xcite , where constraints on the colored states do not affect non - colored sparticles , or scenarios with long decay chains or compressed spectra still remain largely viable @xcite .",
    "compressed scenarios are particularly interesting since the observed dark matter relic density can be achieved in these scenarios thanks to the enhanced effective cross sections due to co - annihilations .",
    "in particular , small mass splittings between squarks and gluino with the lightest neutralino can lead to final states with less energetic jets or leptons , thus reducing the detection efficiency and signal acceptance at the lhc .",
    "monojet searches are particularly sensitive to such scenarios , and we shall show that they are indeed powerful in constraining the mssm , provided all the involved processes are correctly taken into account .",
    "monojet signals in the context of the mssm have already been discussed in specific scenarios  @xcite .",
    "the connections of monojet and dark matter searches at the lhc are discussed in section 2 .",

    "monojet searches at the lhc consist in looking for events with one high-@xmath1 jet and missing energy , and are therefore particularly well - suited for the search of dark matter particles . a schematic representation of monojet events in simplified scenarios in which a dark matter candidate and a mediator are added to the standard model is given in fig .  [ fig : standard_monojets ] .    , width=132 ]",
    "the interpretation of monojet searches has been often performed in the context of effective scenarios , where operators linking quarks and gluons to two dm particles are considered .",
    "hence the constraints obtained on the dark matter particle mass are dependent on the operator under consideration , and can be compared directly to the results of dm direct detection experiments by computing the scattering cross section of dm with standard matter @xcite .",
    "more recently , the validity of the effective approach has been questioned @xcite , and instead simplified scenarios with different configurations of dark matter candidates and mediators have been suggested to probe dark matter at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the constraints obtained from monojet searches are dependent on the natures , masses and couplings of the dark matter candidates and mediator particles . for a specific set - up",
    ", it is possible to reinterpret the results in terms of scattering cross sections of dm with protons and compare it to direct detection experiment results .",
    "in the following we discuss the case of mssm with r - parity conservation and neutralino dark matter .",
    "monojets in this scenario can be generated by the final states with two neutralinos and one hard jet , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : standard_monojets ] , but more importantly two neutralinos , one hard jet and additional soft jets or particles invisible in the detectors .",
    "such final states occur in particular when two squarks or gluinos are produced in addition to a hard jet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm_monojets ] .",
    "this happens in particular in scenarios with compressed spectra , where the direct susy searches are less sensitive but the cross section for the monojet topologies is enhanced by the strong production of degenerate squarks or gluinos .",
    "contrary to the case of simplified or effective approaches , there is no correlation in the mssm between the monojet production cross section , which can probe the strong sector , and the neutralino scattering cross section with matter , which is sensitive to the electroweak sector , so that monojet searches can not be considered anymore as dark matter searches , but as complementary channels to the direct susy searches and to dark matter cosmological and astrophysical observables .    in this analysis , we use madgraph 5 @xcite to compute the full @xmath2 matrix elements corresponding to all the combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 refers to a squark of any type and generation , @xmath7 to the gluino , @xmath8 to any type of slepton , @xmath9 to any electroweakino , and @xmath10 to a hard jet . here",
    "we do not restrict ourselves to initial state radiation of a monojet . to generate events we adopt the cteq6l1 parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "hadronisation is performed using pythia 8 @xcite , and detector effects are simulated with delphes 3.0 @xcite .",
    "the exclusion by the monojet searches is assessed based on the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite analyses , using the same cuts , selection efficiencies , acceptances and backgrounds , and predictions for higher energies are obtained by rescaling the background and assessing the sensitivity without modifying the experimental set - up applied in the 8 tev analyses . in this sense",

    "also , systematic uncertainties have been shown to have an important effect on the limits that can be derived using the monojet signatures @xcite . here",

    "signal selection cuts corresponding to each of the analyses are applied to the simulated signal events .",
    "the number of sm background events in the signal regions are taken from the estimates reported by the experiments .",
    "when the experimental analysis investigates several signal regions , such as the atlas and cms monojet analyses , we calculate the region giving the largest signal - to - background ratio and we only use that region for determining the exclusion .",
    "the 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) exclusion in presence of background only is determined using the cls method  @xcite .    , width=162 ]    in addition , we compute the relic density with superiso relic @xcite , as well as dark matter direct detection observables with micromegas @xcite .",
    "we compare the results to the dark matter density measurement of planck @xcite and to the results of lux @xcite for dm direct detection .",
    "finally , the electroweak observables are computed with a modified version of superiso @xcite .",
    "we consider various sets of simplified models and investigate the complementarity with the traditional jets / leptons + met susy searches .",
    "these models are characterised by a light neutralino accompanied by at least one additional heavier sparticle , while the other sparticle masses are much heavier . in practice , the light sparticles are lighter than about 1 tev , and the other masses are adjusted in the range 1040 tev in order to obtain a correct light higgs mass of 125 gev .",
    "the trilinear couplings of the third generation fermions are chosen in order to have no mixing , and @xmath11 is set to 10 , an intermediate value which allows us to be consistent with the flavor constraints .",
    "the five sets of models correspond to one light neutralino and : a light gluino , degenerate scalar quarks , a light scalar bottom quark , a light scalar top quark , and light neutralino 2 and chargino 1 . for the five scenarios , in addition to the discussion of the lhc supersymmetry and monojet searches , we also checked that the @xmath12 boson mass and electroweak oblique parameters are consistent with the lep measurements @xcite .",
    "concerning dark matter direct detection , we found that for all these scenarios , the neutralino - nucleon spin - independent scattering cross section is always smaller than @xmath13 pb , which is well below the lux limits @xcite , but within reach of the expected sensitivity of lz @xcite .",
    "a general feature exhibited by the scenarios we investigated is the significant improvement in sensitivity in the regions with small mass splittings .",
