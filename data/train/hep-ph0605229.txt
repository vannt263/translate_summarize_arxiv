    "low energy neutrino research was particularly successful in the recent years in neutrino astronomy and neutrino elementary particle physics .",
    "this lead to the first observation of a supernova explosion via neutrino detection  @xcite@xcite , the measurement of the solar neutrino spectrum  @xcite and the discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite@xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the potential for new discoveries if low energy neutrinos can be detected in a large scintillation detector with a total mass of 50  kt using the low background technology developed for the borexino detector  @xcite .",
    "these investigations focus on the following topics :    1 .",
    "solar neutrino spectroscopy , 2 .",
    "neutrino detection from a nearby supernova explosion ( in the center of the milky way ) , 3 .",
    "detection of relic neutrinos from previous supernova explosions , 4 .",

    "the * l*ow * e*nergy * n*eutrino * a*stronomy ( lena ) detector  @xcite@xcite , is assumed to be constructed as a double - walled cylinder with a diameter of 30 m and a length of approximately 100 m. as indicated in figure 1 , the inner volume is instrumented at the walls with photomultiplier tubes providing a surface coverage of 30% photo - sensitive cathode area and filled with 50  kt of liquid scintillator consisting of pxe ( phenyl - o - xylylethane ) as a solvent and @xmath0  2",
    "g / l of ptp and 20  mg / l bismsb serving as a fluor and wavelength shifter .",
    "this scintillator was developed as an option for the borexino detector  @xcite .",
    "the scintillator provides a density of 0.98  g/@xmath1 . with a light transmission length of 12  m a photoelectron efficiency of @xmath2  pe",
    "/ mev is expected .",
    "this is a quite realistic value considering the value of @xmath3  m measured at the counting test facility ( ctf ) in gran sasso  @xcite .",
    "+ in the outer section of the cylinder , 2  m of water provide shielding against external radioactivity , as well as a water cerenkov detector serving as a muon veto .",
    "this design should make it possible to reach a sufficiently low internal gamma - induced background to avoid too high a signal rate at the photomultiplier tubes provided the photomultipliers are sufficiently low in internal radioactivity .",
    "+ the detector is designed for a detection threshold of 250 kev , yielding 30  photoelectrons at threshold , and should be constructed at a deep underground site of more than 4000 m water equivalent to provide a sufficient muon background reduction . at the same time , it should be far enough from nuclear power plants to limit the electron antineutrino background . in europe",
    ", there are two favourable sites satisfying these requirements .",
    "one is in the south of greece , at the nestor deep underwater laboratory where the detector might be placed at a depth of 4000 - 5000 m water in the mediterranean sea .",
    "a second suitable place might be at the deep underground laboratory in pyhsalmi ( cupp : center of underground physics in pyhsalmi ) in a mine at a depth of 1400 m rock .",
    "both laboratories are situated far from nuclear power plants . for the pyhsalmi laboratory  @xcite ,",
    "the estimated electron antineutrino background flux from nuclear power plants of about @xmath4  m@xmath5  s@xmath6 is sufficiently low even if a nuclear power reactor plant would be constructed in finland in the future .",
    "the detector lena would be able to detect solar @xmath7be neutrinos via neutrino electron scattering with a rate of @xmath8  events / day . depending on the signal - to - background ratio , this would provide a sensitivity for time variations in the @xmath7be neutrino flux of @xmath9% during one month of measuring time .",
    "such a sensitivity may give information at a unique level on helioseismology ( pressure or temperature fluctuations ) and on a possible magnetic moment interaction with a timely varying solar magnetic field .",
    "+ the additional detection of pep neutrinos ( see figure 2 ) with a rate of @xmath10  events / day could provide information on neutrino oscillation which is expected to show a transition from matter - induced oscillation to vacuum oscillation in the energy range between @xmath11  mev .",
    "the ratio of the neutino flux from the reactions of pep fusion and pp fusion is theoretically determined with an accuracy @xmath12% .",
    "thus the measurement of the pep neutrino flux is effectively as well determining the pp solar neutrino flux .",
    "+ the neutrino flux from the cno cycle is theoretically predicted only with the lowest accuracy ( 30% ) of all solar neutrino fluxes . therefore , lena would provide a new opportunity for a detailed study of solar physics on a level which will exceed the information provided by borexino from the statistics point of view by a factor of more than 100 provided the extremely high radiopurity of the scintillator expected for borexino will as well be reached in lena .",
    "+ with a liquid scintillator , @xmath13c atoms naturally contained in it can be used as target for @xmath14b neutrinos  @xcite as the energy threshold is 2.2  mev .",
    "around 360  events of this type per year can be estimated for lena .",
    "a deformation due to the msw - effect should be observable in the low - energy regime of the @xmath15b neutrino spectrum after a couple of years of measurements .",
    "a 8  m@xmath16 supernova exploding in the centre of the milky way typically will induce a signal rate of @xmath17  events . this would include neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavours .",
    "the rates of the different reaction channels are listed in table 1 and have been obtained by scaling the predicted rates from  @xcite@xcite to lena .",
    "a discrimination between electron neutrinos and electron antineutrinos would be possible by the interaction of antineutrinos via inverse beta decay and neutrino interaction at @xmath18c .",
    "the first three are charged current reactions that will deliver information on @xmath19 and @xmath20 fluxes and spectra .",
    "the last three are neutral current reactions , sensitive to all neutrino flavours .",
    "these reactions give information on the total flux .",
    "+    .possible neutrino reactions in a liquid scintillation type detector and expected event rates for a 8  @xmath21 supernova in the center of our galaxy ( @xmath22  kpc distance ) .",
    "for the first five reactions , see reference  @xcite , for the last reaction , see reference  @xcite . in both cases , the event rates calculated for other detectors were scaled to those in lena taking into account the number of target atoms in the fiducial volume .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     due to the high statistics of the neutrino detection a time - resolved neutrino - flux rate for different neutrino interactions could be measured which would give new information on the dynamics of supernova explosions and would be complementary to the information accessible in large water - cerenkov detectors or in a large liquid - argon detector .",
    "a calculated neutrino time spectrum for a typical type ii supernova explosion is depicted in fig 3 .",
    "the detection of relic neutrinos from supernova explosions ( supernova relic neutrinos srn ) in the early universe provide information on supernova explosion mechanism , the early star - formation rate and thus , important cosmological data .",
    "the current best limit on srn - flux comes from the superkamiokande experiment , giving an upper limit of 1.2  cm@xmath5s@xmath6 for @xmath24 with an energy threshold of 19.3  mev  @xcite . with lena ,",
    "the sensitivity would be increased , as the inverse beta decay can be used as detection reaction .",
    "this provides a good background rejection and the threshold energy is expected to be @xmath22  mev . + the detection of supernove relic neutrinos is particularly challenging as it is strongly dependent on the low background conditions of the detector with respect to electron antineutrinos from nuclear power reactors . to our knowledge",
    "both locations envisioned for lena are suitable in this respect . following the present models of cosmology ,",
    "the expected detection rate for these electron antineutrinos is in the order of several events per year .",
    "here it is essential to measure the electron antineutrino spectrum down to as low energies as possible .",
    "unique information on the interior of the earth can be obtained by the detection of electron antineutrinos from the earth .",
    "present technology permits drilling of holes down to a depth of approximately 10 km , compared to the earth radius of @xmath25  km .",
    "it is known that the emitted heat from the earth exceeds the energy flow from the sun by around @xmath26  tw .",
    "this excess is generally attributed to heat emitted by natural radioactivity of material inside the earth  @xcite .",
    "however , estimations of the earth s interior composition accounts only for half of this radioactivity .",
    "therefore a measurement of the electron antineutrino flux could provide valuable information to solve this puzzle .",
    "these so - called geoneutrinos were recently measured for the first time by the liquid scintillator detector kamland  @xcite . in figure 4 , the expected spectra for @xmath27u , @xmath28th and @xmath29k decay chain neutrinos are plotted .",
    "neutrinos from @xmath29k being below the energy threshold of the inverse beta decay reaction can not be detected .",
    "however , with a good energy - resolution ( high statistics ) , neutrinos from @xmath27u and @xmath28th decay chain can be discriminated .",
    "+ in addition , if directional information on the antineutrino flux can be obtained , a spatial distribution of the natural radioactivity in the interior of the earth could be derived . scaling the experimental result from kamland to lena detector yields an event rate in the range between @xmath30 and @xmath31  y@xmath6 for the location in pyhsalmi ( continental crust ) . in the first calculations , we overestimated lena s directional sensitivity based on the n - displacement after inverse beta decay of the proton due to the neutrino momentum .",
    "these calculations are currently being revised .",
    "+ a natural nuclear reactor has been suggested to reside in the centre of the earth thus providing an explanation for the missing energy source in the earth  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a nuclear reactor ( for example of @xmath32  tw ) could be tested with lena .",
    "a large scintillation detector provides unique sensitivity to the proton decay channel @xmath33 .",
    "this is due to the high energy resolution obtained in a scintillator which attains an approximately 50 times larger light output than water - cerenkov detectors at energies below 1  gev .",
    "this decay mode is favoured in many supersymmetry theories and may be expected with a lifetime @xmath34 below @xmath35 .",
    "the experimental limits on this decay mode ( super - kamiokande with @xmath36  @xcite ) are essentially restrained by the capability of background suppression or signal identification in the detector .",
    "based on monte carlo calculations for this decay mode , a lower limit of @xmath37 at @xmath38 c.l . has been derived  @xcite .",
    "more detailed information on this result is given in a contribution to this conference by t. marrodn undagoitia .",
    "a large scintillation detector with a total detector mass of 50  kt may provide a unique tool for neutrino astronomy , geophysics and elementary particle physics .",
    "a more detailed design study will be performed in the near future .",
    "the use of a scintillator as a neutrino target and detector medium has a variety of advantages due to the very high light output . + this detector would be largely complementary to a megaton water cerenkov detector being discussed for different locations in europe , usa and japan .",
    "due to a competence and expertise present in europe , especially for scintillation detectors with extremely low background at low energies , a lena type detector may be of particular interest to be investigated in europe .",
