    "an elliptic operator on a compact manifold @xmath0 without boundary can be extended to a fredholm operator between appropriate sobolev spaces . if in addition the operator is formally self  adjoint , this extension is self  adjoint . as a consequence , the spectrum is then real and discrete and there exists a basis of eigenvectors . on compact manifolds with boundary",
    "the situation is essentially the same if one imposes boundary conditions that are elliptic and self  adjoint .",
    "this paper investigates the conditions for ellipticity and self  adjointness of certain local boundary value problems that arise in surface theory and computer graphics .",
    "the elliptic operators we deal with are operators of dirac type that allow to describe conformal deformations of immersed surfaces in euclidean 3space .",
    "they can be most easily described within the quaternionic approach @xcite of g.  kamberov , f.  pedit , and the second author ( see also @xcite for different perspectives on the application of dirac operators to surface theory ) . given an immersion @xmath1 into euclidean 3space viewed as the imaginary quaternions , every conformal deformation @xmath2 of @xmath3 has a differential of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a quaternion valued function satisfying a dirac type equation @xmath6 for some real valued function @xmath7 with @xmath8 an elliptic operator attached to @xmath3 . by conformal deformation",

    "in @xcite it is shown that this relation between surface theory and dirac operators can be turned into an efficient method for implementing conformal deformations in computer graphics .",
    "the idea of @xcite is to `` reverse '' the above correspondence that assigns to a conformal deformation @xmath2 of @xmath3 the dirac potential @xmath7 in and to describe conformal deformations @xmath9 of a given immersion @xmath3 by the corresponding potentials @xmath7 .",
    "this makes sense , because by the above every conformal deformation @xmath2 of a given @xmath3 can indeed be obtained from a suitable real function @xmath7 by solving for @xmath10 in the kernel of @xmath11 and integrating @xmath12 .",
    "the main difficulty with this idea ( apart from controlling the periods of @xmath12 if @xmath0 has non  trivial topology ) is that the correspondence between @xmath7 and @xmath2 is not a bijection .",
    "for example , given a real function @xmath7 , the operator @xmath11 might not have a kernel ; and if it has one , the kernel might not be 1dimensional and sections in the kernel might have zeros , so that @xmath2 is not immersed . as shown in @xcite , the first issue ( that @xmath13 might be empty ) can be efficiently dealt with by allowing to modify @xmath7 by a real constant @xmath14 , that is , by taking for @xmath10 an eigenspinor @xmath15 with @xmath14 an eigenvalue of preferably small modulus ( the second issue can be ignored for many applications in computer graphics , because generically a non  trivial eigenspace will be 1dimensional ) . for the method of @xcite to work",
    "it is crucial to make sure that the spectrum of @xmath11 is ( or at least contains ) a non  empty real point spectrum .",

    "one would expect that one can follow this upward flow of eigenvalues by a continuous family of eigenspinors for the respective eigenvalues .",
    "this would allow to realize spectral flow geometrically by immersed discs , presumably with rotational symmetry .",
    "assuming this is possible ,    * the upward flow of eigenvalues in the negative part of the spectrum @xmath448 would amount to `` continuously '' climbing up on the leftmost side in the periodic table of dirac spheres in figure  [ fig : periodic - table - of - dirac ] ( for the expected `` backward '' flow @xmath449 from @xmath431 to @xmath417 , see figure  [ fig : flow - to - snowman ] ) , * the flow from @xmath416 to @xmath367 would `` continuously '' interpolate between half  spheres with opposite orientations ( see figure  [ fig : conjectured - flow ] ) , and * the upward flow in the positive part @xmath426 would amount to going down `` continuously '' on the leftmost side in the periodic table of dirac spheres in figure  [ fig : periodic - table - of - dirac ] .",
    "this indicates that geometrically the spectral flow in our example corresponds to `` wrapping up '' the disc / half  sphere by rotating its bi  normal field around the boundary curve .",
