    "spin - powered pulsars show highly pulsed emission from the radio to @xmath13-rays , arising from acceleration zones in their magnetospheres . in the uv to soft x - ray band ,",
    "however , thermal emission from the neutron star ( ns ) surface can contribute significantly for middle - aged pulsars , with characteristic ages @xmath14@xmath15 yr . spectral and timing measurements can separate these two components , allowing a measure of the surface temperature and thermal luminosity . by measuring thermal emission as a function of age , one can probe the equation of state of matter at supranuclear densities in the ns core and constrain the surface composition . observations with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories have begun to reveal much about the thermal component ( see pavlov , zavlin , & sanwal 2002 and kaspi , roberts , & harding 2004 for recent reviews ) .",
    "however , since typical effective temperatures of middle - aged pulsars are as low as @xmath16100 ev , and interstellar absorption severely attenuates the flux below @xmath17 kev , the x - ray observations of these objects can only probe the wein tail of the surface thermal spectrum .",
    "two issues then complicate the interpretation . first , surface composition can dramatically affect the x - ray flux ( romani 1987 ; zavlin & pavlov 2002 ) with light element atmosphere leading to a large wien excess .",
    "second , any surface temperature inhomogeneities will also complicate the spectrum , with hot spots disproportionally important in the high energy ( x - ray ) tail .",
    "for these reasons , comparison of the x - ray results with uv emission from the rayleigh - jeans side of the thermal bump is particularly valuable .",
    "the challenge here is that non - thermal magnetospheric emission becomes increasingly dominant as one moves to the red ( pavlov et al .",
    "fortunately , the nuv - mama and fuv - mama detectors of the space telescope imaging spectrometer ( stis ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) offer access to the uv emission and provide the phase - resolved measurements that can help to separate the thermal and non - thermal fluxes .",

    "contrary to most spin - powered pulsars , geminga is not a strong radio source .",
    "detection of pulsed radio emission at 102 mhz was claimed by malofeev & malov ( 1997 ) , kuzmin & losovskii ( 1997 ) , and shitov & pugachev ( 1997 ) , but the pulsar has not been detected at other frequencies ( e.g. , mclaughlin et al .",

    "the most recent ephemerides of geminga were published by jackson et al .",

    "the expected frequency shift during the fuv+nuv observation , @xmath189 , is much smaller than the frequency uncertainties in our measurement , which means that this observation is not sensitive to frequency derivative @xmath190 .    since our spectral analysis has shown that the fuv radiation is predominantly thermal , while the nuv radiation has a significant contribution from the magnetospheric component ( see  2.3 and fig .",

    "the ts component can be interpreted as emission from the bulk of ns surface , the th component can be ascribed to emission from smaller , hotter regions of the ns surface , and the pl component represents the magnetospheric radiation .",

    "we note , however , that the @xmath236 values corresponding to these contours , @xmath237 and @xmath238 @xmath1 for the ts+th+pl and bb+pl models , respectively , significantly exceed the @xmath239 @xmath1 obtained from the _ rosat _ pspc observations ( halpern & wang 1997 ) , which indicates a discrepancy between the pspc and epic responses at low energies . if we fix @xmath236 at the best - fit pspc value , the confidence contours shift to higher temperatures and lower radii ( see the lower - right epic - pn contours in fig .",

    "for example , the odds - ratio method applied for 42,170 events in the 0.234.0 kev band , extracted from @xmath210-radius circle , gives @xmath244 for the mean frequency and standard deviation , and @xmath245 for the median frequency and 68% , 90% , and 99% uncertainties .",
    "the most probable frequencies are consistently lower , by 0.10.3 @xmath33hz , than the frequency @xmath246 predicted by the j02 ephemeris . however , since the differences do not exceed 3@xmath247 uncertainties of our measurements , it is still possible that the j02 ephemeris is applicable at the epoch of the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",

    "since significant variations of the ns temperature and emitting area in a ten year span of these observations can hardly be expected , the discrepancy is most likely due to discrepant instrument responses at low energies .",
    "as we have shown in  3.1 , the observed thermal uv spectrum of geminga either matches the continuation of the thermal x - ray spectrum or lies somewhat below that continuation ( up to about one stellar magnitude ) , depending on assumed extinction and x - ray spectral model . on the contrary , other",
    "nss observed in both uv and optical show relatively brighter rayleigh - jeans components , well above the continuation of the x - ray thermal spectrum . to demonstrate this difference and show that it is not associated with uncertainties in instrument responses , we re - analyzed the fuv - mama and epic data on the best - studied isolated neutron star , rx  j1856.53754 ( j1856 hereafter ; see trmper et al .",

    "we found that the two epic - pn spectra of j1856 are well consistent with each other in the 0.31 kev range ( there is no spectral information available below 0.3 kev in the data collected in timing mode ) .",
    "since j1856 does not show a nonthermal component , we fit the spectra with a single - component bb model and plot the corresponding confidence contours in figure 13 [ @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 for the pn , mos1 and mos2 detectors , respectively ] . in the same figure",
    "we also plot the confidence contours obtained from fitting the 449.9 ks observation of 2001 october 815 with the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) on _ chandra _ ( see burwitz et al .",
    "2003 ) ; the corresponding hydrogen column density is @xmath269 . we see that the observations with different x - ray instruments yield quite different spectral parameters .",
    "this demonstrates once more the lack of proper cross - calibration of instrument responses to soft spectra and the fact that systematic uncertainties greatly exceed statistical ones for spectra with good statistics .",
    "even with allowance for the uncertainties in instrument responses , we see from figure 13 that the uv contours lie well above the x - ray contours , i.e. , the extrapolation of the x - ray blackbody spectrum of j1856 into the uv - optical range strongly _ underpredicts _ the observed uv - optical fluxes , contrary to geminga ( cf",
    ".  fig .  9 ) .",
    "the uv - optical excess in the thermal spectra of j1856 and other so - called x - ray dim isolated nss ( e.g. , rx j0720.4@xmath753125 ) could be explained assuming that x - rays are emitted from a small hotter area while the optical - uv radiation is emitted from the bulk of ns surface , including colder areas invisible in x - rays ( e.g. , pavlov et al .",
    "obviously , the apparently smaller uv - emitting area of geminga , as compared to the x - ray - emitting area , can not be explained by a nonuniform temperature distribution .",
    "we might speculate that the temperature distribution over the bulk of geminga s surface is more uniform than in the case of j1856 , e.g. , because of a different geometry and strength of the magnetic field that affects the heat conductivity and , hence , the surface temperature distribution .",
    "however , to explain why the more uniformly heated geminga exhibits quite substantial pulsations of its thermal radiation ( @xmath270 in soft x - rays ) while no pulsations have been detected from j1856 , one has to assume a special orientation of the spin axis of j1856 .    any realistic interpretation of thermal emission from nss should take into account possible deviations of thermal spectra emitted from ns surface layers ( e.g. , atmospheres ) from the idealized planck spectra as well as the anisotropy of the surface emission associated with strong magnetic fields ( e.g. , pavlov et al .  1995 ; rajagopal , romani , & miller 1997 ; zavlin & pavlov 2002 ) .",
    "for instance , since the x - ray spectrum emitted from a strongly ionized hydrogen atmosphere is harder than the planck spectrum , a blackbody fit of such a spectrum gives a temperature exceeding the actual effective temperature by a factor of 1.52.5 and a radius a factor of 315 smaller than the actual radius of the ns , at a given distance .",
    "moreover , the optical part of the spectrum emitted from such an atmosphere strongly exceeds the extrapolation of the blackbody fit of its x - ray spectrum into the optical domain ( pavlov et al .  1996 ) .",
    "although the fully ionized atmosphere models are not applicable to cold nss ( e.g. , they give an improbably large radius - to - distance ratio , @xmath271 km at @xmath31 pc , for geminga ; meyer , pavlov , & mszros 1994 ) , atmospheric effects might , in principle , explain the large difference between the observed uv spectrum and the continuation of the blackbody fit of the x - ray thermal spectrum in j1856 and similar nss .",
    "however , no realistic models adequately describing the observed broad - band spectrum of j1856 have been suggested so far , which is not suprising given the extremely complicated physics of the dense , strongly magnetized matter at the relatively low temperature of the surface layers .",
    "if we adopt such an interpretation of the strong deviation of the j1856 broad - band spectrum from a pure blackbody spectrum , then we have to explain why the broad - band spectrum of geminga is so different from that of j1856 .",
    "possible hypotheses might involve different chemical compositions of the surface layers and/or substantially different magnetic fields ( a crude estimate of the geminga s magnetic field is @xmath272 g , but the magnetic field of j1856 is quite uncertain ) .",
    "moreover , the surface layers of geminga and j1856 might be in different phase states .",
    "for instance , one could speculate that the cold surface of geminga is in a solid state while the ( hotter ) surface of j1856 is in a gaseous or liquid state , which might explain their different spectra . to distinguish between these possibilities , reliable models for ns thermal emission at relatively low temperatures , with account for the contribution of molecules in the opacity of gaseous atmospheres with strong magnetic fields ( turbiner & lpez vieyra 2004 ) and possible condensation of the surface layers into a liquid or solid state ( van adelsberg , lai , & potekhin 2004 ) , are to be developed and compared with the observational data .",
    "until reliable models are available , the temperatures and radii obtained from applying simplified models ( blackbody , fully ionized atmospheres , partially ionized atmospheres without molecules ) should be considered as crude estimates only , and any conclusions based on such fits should be considered with caution . however , although we can not trust absolute values of the parameters obtained with the aid of simplified models , some interesting qualitative results can be obtained from comparison of the same parameter measured for different nss .",
    "for instance , fits of the soft x - ray spectra of geminga and an older pulsar b105552 with any model available give a lower temperature for the younger geminga , which may have very interesting implications for the ns cooling models , suggesting different masses of these nss ( yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) .    as we mentioned in  3.1 , in addition to the thermal soft ( ts ) component",
    ", the x - ray spectrum of geminga apparently has a thermal hard ( th ) component , with a much higher temperature , @xmath273 mk , and an apparent ( isotropic ) luminosity @xmath274 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "although such a component has been seen in the spectra of other middle - aged pulsars , the effective radius , @xmath275 m , for the geminga s th component is surprisingly small in comparison with the conventional polar cap radius , @xmath276 m , suggested by the pulsar models . such a small value of @xmath277 might be explained by a projection effect ( if the magnetic axis remains almost perpendicular to the line of sight in the course of ns rotation ) , but this explanation can hardly be reconciled with the high pulsed fraction at energies where the th component contribution is maximal ( see  4.1.2 ) . on the other hand , we should remember that the ts component was obtained assuming planck spectra for both thermal components and a single power law for the magnetospheric spectrum .",
    "because both these assumptions are not necessarily correct , we can not rule out the possibility that the `` th component '' is simply associated with a harder high - energy tail of the surface radiation ( compared to the pure wien spectrum ) or it is due to a steepening of the slope of the phase - integrated magnetospheric spectrum with decreasing photon energy ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing results of our stis mama observations of geminga is the strong , non - sinusoidal pulsations in the fuv range , where the spectrum is dominated by the thermal component , most likely emitted from the bulk of ns surface .",
    "the shape of the fuv pulsations is different from that of the soft x - ray pulsations , where the ts component dominates ( see fig .",
    "obviously , neither fuv nor soft x - ray pulsations can be produced by the locally isotropic blackbody emission .",
    "to explain the unusual pulse shape and the large pulsed fraction of the thermal fuv and soft x - ray radiation , we have to invoke effects of strong magnetic field on the angular dependence of ns surface emission or assume that there is a `` screen '' in the ns magnetosphere which may partially eclipse the surface emission at some rotation phases .    in a strong magnetic field , @xmath278 g , when the electron cyclotron energy @xmath279 exceeds the photon energy , the local emission is essentially anisotropic ( in particular , beamed along the direction of the magnetic field ) , which may lead to strong pulsations of the thermal radiation .",
    "the angular distribution and the shape of pulsations depend on the properties of the emitting region . for instance , the angular distribution of local emission from a fully ionized ns atmosphere shows a strong , narrow peak [ @xmath280 along the magnetic field ( pencil component ) and a broad fan - like component across the magnetic field ( pavlov et al .",
    "when integrated over the visible surface of a ns with a dipole magnetic field , the angular distribution of ns radiation is beamed along the magnetic axis , even in the case of a uniformly heated ns surface ( zavlin & pavlov 2002 ) .",
    "such peaks could explain the soft x - ray pulsations ( at @xmath281 ) , including the observed increase of pulsed fraction with energy . in this hypothesis , the 0.20.5 kev pulse profile ( see fig .",
    "12 ) can be interpreted as a sum of a smooth thermal component ( the broad thermal peak , with a maximum at @xmath282 , corresponds to the closest approach of the magnetic axis to the line of sight ) , and small `` wiggles '' ( e.g. , at @xmath283 ) due to the contribution of the magnetospheric radiation . however , at @xmath284 the peaks in the model angular distribution are too low to be responsible for the observed fuv pulsations . on the other hand ,",
    "as we mentioned above , the fully ionized atmosphere models are not directly applicable to the cold geminga , while the partially ionized atmospheres have not been well investigated .",
    "if the ns surface matter is in a condensed state , we also should expect an anisotropic emission .",
    "although the angular distribution of emission from a condensed surface has not been studied , the examples of spectral emissivity for several directions , calculated by van adelsberg et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , suggest that at least local radiation is beamed along the magnetic field . to understand whether the radiation from the entire ns surface can show pulsations similar to those observed from geminga , the local specific fluxes should be integrated over the visible ns surface , for various magnetic field geometries and orientations of the spin and magnetic axes ( see prez - azorn , miralles , & pons 2004 for a few examples ) .    an alternative explanation for the narrow deep minima in the uv pulse profiles could be a partial eclipse by an object co - rotating with the ns .",
    "since the shapes of the uv and soft x - ray light curves are different ( in particular , the minima are broader in soft x - rays ) , the eclipsing object should have a wavelength - dependent effective size .",
    "a natural candidate for such a screen is the magnetospheric electron - positron plasma which can absorb the ns surface radiation as a result of the cyclotron resonance scattering in a resonance layer , where the cyclotron energy is equal to the photon energy in the rest frame of the electron ( e.g. , blandford & scharlemann 1975 ) .",
    "two types of models have been discussed for the scattering region : a stationary nonrelativistic plasma in the closed magnetic field lines zone ( rajagopal & romani 1997 ; wang et al .",
    "1998 ; ruderman 2003 ) and streams of ultrarelativistic electron - positron pairs ejected along the open field lines ( e.g. , lyubarskii & petrova 1998 , 2000 , and references therein ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the effects of the resonant inverse compton scattering on the properties of observed uv / x - ray radiation have not been investigated in detail ; however , crude estimates show that an extremely large pair multiplicity is needed to reach an optical thickness of @xmath285 . in the case of nonrelativistic plasma in the closed zone , which can be supported against the gravitational force by the thermal radiation pressure enhanced by the cyclotron resonance ( mitrofanov & pavlov 1982 ; rajagopal & romani 1997 ) ,",
    "the effects of resonant cyclotron scattering become significant if the electron / positron number density is a factor of @xmath286 larger than the corotation ( goldreich - julian ) density , @xmath287 @xmath288 for geminga .",
    "the electron - positron pairs could be supplied from acceleration zones , but rapid pair production ( large multiplicity ) is needed to provide so high densities .",
    "in addition , it remains unclear how the electrons / positrons would lose the longitudinal momentum to become nonrelativistic particles ( the transverse momentum is essentially nonrelativistic due to the fast synchrotron / cyclotron losses ) .",
    "if , nevertheless , there is such a nonrelativistic plasma screen in the closed zone , the wavelength dependence of its optical thickness depends on spatial distribution of scattering particles . in particular , the assumption that the minima in the uv light curves of geminga are caused by such a rotating screen implies a significant amount of electron - positron pairs at a distance of @xmath289 , where the magnetic field is @xmath290 g. one might speculate that the broader minima in the soft x - ray light curve are also caused by a partial eclipse by the screen . in this case , the x - ray resonance layer ( at a distance @xmath291 ) should subtend a larger solid angle than the uv resonance layer . alternatively ,",
    "if the soft x - rays pulsations are caused not by the screen but by the intrinsic anisotropy of the thermal radition in the strong magnetic field ( see above ) , then the magnetosphere is transparent for the x - rays we observe , i.e. the inner boundary of the plasma screen is located beyond @xmath291 .    to infer the size of the putative screen and understand the spatial distribution of electrons",
    "/ positrons , independent information on the orientation of the spin and magnetic axes would be very useful .",
    "such information could be obtained from x - ray pulsations of the th component emitted by hot polar caps , which apparently contributes to the x - ray spectrum around @xmath2920.7 kev ( see fig .",
    "caraveo et al .",
    "( 2004b ) have interpreted the epic data as displaying a varying th component arising from a rotating polar cap . however , in our analysis the contribution of this component to the spectral flux is small and is not clearly seen in the pulse profile .",
    "indeed , the 0.61.0 kev pulse profile ( fig .",
    "12 ) can be decomposed into a broad thermal pulse with a maximum at @xmath293 , similar to the mainly thermal 0.20.5 kev pulse , and a narrower nonthermal pulse centered at the same phase , @xmath294 , as the higher of the two purely nonthermal peaks in 28 kev light curve . in other words",
    ", we see no convincing evidence for the `` th component '' ( hence , polar caps ) in the energy - dependent light curves .",
    "more definitive information on the axis orientation could be obtained from phase - resolved x - ray polarimetry ( e.g. , pavlov & zavlin 2000 ; lai & ho 2003 ) , but it is not possible with the currently operating x - ray missions .",
    "the multiwavelength observations of geminga show that its emission in the nir - optical , hard x - rays , and @xmath13-rays is nonthermal , presumably generated in the ns magnetosphere .",
    "the comparative analysis of the results of these observations provides an opportunity to understand the mechanisms responsible for the magnetospheric emission in different energy bands .",
    "first , we can compare the phase - integrated x - ray spectra at @xmath25 kev and optical spectra at @xmath295 ev , where the nonthermal emission dominates .",
    "as shown in  3.1 , the fits to the x - ray spectrum yield substantially different slopes of the pl component , depending on whether the th component is included in the model . with the data available , we can not statistically prove or reject the th component .",
    "however , we can extrapolate the pl components of the two different models ( with and without the th component ) to the optical and compare the extrapolations with the observed nonthermal spectra ( figs .  7 and 10 )",
    ". the pl fit of the 2.510 kev tail has about the same slope as the optical pl component [ @xmath296 , @xmath297 and @xmath298 for e(b@xmath75v ) = 0.03 and 0.07 , respectively ] , and the extrapolation of the x - ray pl spectrum is marginally consistent with the optical fluxes ( the uncertainty of the extrapolation is shown in fig .",
    "10 [ lower panel ] and fig .",
    "14 for absorbed and unabsorbed spectra , respectively ) .",
    "the nir through x - ray spectrum can be crudely described by a pl model with a slope @xmath299 , which is smaller than @xmath300 and @xmath301 , but the differences are close to 1 @xmath247 uncertainties of the photon indices .",
    "similar nir through x - ray behavior , with @xmath302 , has been seen in another middle - aged pulsar , b0656 + 14 ( pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ; zavlin & pavlov 2004a ) .",
    "such behavior implies that the optical and x - ray emission are generated by the same population of relativistic particles with a pl energy spectrum , and by the same ( likely synchrotron ) mechanism .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that the ratio of optical - to - x - ray luminosities is about the same for all the pulsars observed in both x - rays and optical , despite a large scatter of the x - ray and optical `` efficiencies '' , @xmath303 and @xmath304 ( zavlin & pavlov 2004b ) .    if the th component is not included in the fit , the extrapolation of the pl component ( @xmath305 ) of the bb+pl fit of the 0.210 kev spectrum exceeds the optical fluxes by more than two orders of magnitude ( see the upper panel of fig .",
    "this might imply a flattening of the spectrum with decreasing energy , as observed in the younger crab and vela pulsars ( sollerman et al.2000 ; romani et al .",
    "however , the continuation toward higher energies of the nir - optical pl component crosses the x - ray pl component at energies @xmath306 kev , which means a `` double break '' of the spectrum between the optical and x - ray bands ( i.e. , @xmath222 becomes smaller than @xmath301 and then increases to @xmath300 ) .",
    "although such behavior has been suggested ( with a considerable uncertainty ) for the young lmc pulsar b054069 ( serafimovich et al .",
    "2004 ) , it was not observed in other pulsars and currently does not look very plausible .",

    "egret @xmath13-ray spectrum has a slope @xmath307 in the energy range 70 mev to 2 gev ( mayer - hasselwander et al .",
    "1994 ) , close to that inferred from the pl fit of the 2.510 kev tail . however , the extrapolation of the egret spectrum into the x - ray range exceeds the x - ray pl tail by about one order of magnitude , while the extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum into the egret range underpredicts the observed flux by a factor of @xmath29220 at 2 gev .",
    "( the discrepancy is of course much larger if we take the pl component of the bb+pl fit . )",
    "interestingly , the extrapolation of the pl that crudely connects the optical and x - ray points ( @xmath299 ) predicts approximately correct @xmath13-ray fluxes at @xmath308 gev , but the difference in the slopes is a factor of 2.5 larger than the 1 @xmath247 error of @xmath309 . thus ,",
    "unless there is a significant systematic error in the egret data analysis , we have to conclude that there should be a double break in the spectrum between the epic and egret bands , which likely means that the @xmath13-ray ray emission is generated by a different mechanism ( e.g. , curvature radiation ) , or by a different population of relativistic particles , than the optical / x - ray emission .",
    "the _ cgro _",
    "comptel and osse observations were not sensitive enough to prove or reject the existence of such a break ( kuiper et al .  1996 ; strickman et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in the above discussion on the connection between the nir - optical and hard x - ray phase - integrated spectra",
    ", it was assumed that each of them can be adequately described by a pl model .",
    "in fact , it is quite plausible that the nonthermal high - energy radiation of pulsars is comprised of several components that are peaked in different directions ( phases ) and have different spectral slopes , as it has been recently observed in the hard x - ray emission of the vela pulsar ( harding et al .",
    "2002 ) and is routinely seen in the @xmath13-ray range ( e.g. , fierro et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this case",
    "one should expect the phase - integrated spectrum to have a concave shape ( in a log - log scale ) , with excesses at low and high energies dominated by the softer and harder components , respectively .",
    "some indications of such a concave spectrum are seen in the geminga s nonthermal x - ray component : while fitting the high - energy tail of the geminga s epic - pn spectrum with a single pl and different low - energy cut - offs ( @xmath310 ) , we noticed that the best - fit @xmath222 increases with decreasing @xmath310 ( e.g. , @xmath311 , @xmath312 , and @xmath313 at @xmath314 , 2.5 , and 2.0 kev , respectively ) .",
    "although the change of @xmath222 is not statistically significant , such a trend suggests that the tail is concave rather than flat , which , in turn , hints that there may be several emission components ( unless the high - energy tail of the thermal component is harder than in the thermal models we used ) .",
    "unfortunately , the s / n at @xmath25 kev is too low to verify this directly with phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the nonthermal pulsations in different energy bands . the @xmath13-ray light curve ( lower panel of fig .",
    "12 ) shows two peaks per period , at @xmath315 ( peak 1 ) and @xmath316 ( peak 2 ) , with a bridge between them . in the x - ray 28 kev band ,",
    "we also see two peaks , but they are broader , their separation ( @xmath317 or @xmath318 ) differs significantly from the @xmath319 in @xmath13-rays , and about 60%-70% of the 28 kev emission is unpulsed , in contrast to about 100% pulsed @xmath13-ray emission .",
    "we can not determine from these data alone what is the correspondence ( if any ) between the x - ray and @xmath13-ray peaks ( e.g , the higher x - ray peak could correspond to either peak 2 or peak 1 , which would mean that it trails the corresponding @xmath13-ray peak by @xmath320 or 0.05 , respectively ) .",
    "it is tempting to identify the stronger x - ray emission at phases @xmath292 0.10.5 as a bridge similar to that in the @xmath13-ray light curve ( which would mean that the higher x - ray peak corresponds to peak 2 ) , but the low s / n at these phases makes this identification rather uncertain .",
    "moreover , since no statistically significant change of the peak phases with energy is seen in the 0.033 gev egret range , it is quite possible that the 28 kev x - ray peaks do not directly correspond to the @xmath13-ray peaks , being produced by a distinct mechanism .",
    "observations at intermediate energies , 10 kev  10 mev , are needed to clarify this issue .",
    "as we mentioned above , the highly asymmetric pulse profile at intermediate x - ray energies 0.61 kev can possibly be decomposed into two components : a broad , likely thermal , component , centered at @xmath321 , similar to that seen in the 0.20.5 kev band , and a narrower nonthermal peak around the phase @xmath322 of the higher of two 28 kev peaks . however , the putative nonthermal peak at 0.61 kev looks significantly broader than the corresponding peak at 28 kev , while the lower 28 kev peak is hardly seen in the 0.61 kev band .",
    "the 0.20.5 kev light curve is clearly dominated by the very broad , thermal peak centered at @xmath282 ; in the simple dipole geometry of magnetic field ( and the corresponding axisymmetric temperature distribution ) , this phase corresponds to the nearest approach of the only visible magnetic pole to the center of stellar disk .",
    "small contributions from the nontheramal radiation are likely seen even at these low energies : e.g. , some excess emission over the smooth pulse profile at @xmath3230.65 might be due to the nonthermal peak centered at @xmath324 , while the narrow `` sub - peak '' at @xmath283 might be associated with the lower of two 28 kev peaks .",
    "so , it seems that the two nonthermal x - ray peaks persist through the whole observed x - ray range , being most clearly seen in the 28 kev band , where they are not `` contaminated '' by the thermal radiation .",
    "the connection between the optical - uv and x - ray/@xmath13-ray pulsations ( see figs .  8 and 12 ) remains unclear .",
    "we do see two peaks in the fuv band , with about 0.45 phase separation , but they may not be related to the hard x - ray and/or @xmath13-ray pulsations because the fuv spectrum is mostly thermal .",
    "we see only one broad peak in the nuv light curve , where the nonthermal contribution is substantial , @xmath32540% , but we can not rule out the possiblity that it is composed of two peaks because the nuv light curve is very noisy . two peaks with a separation of about 0.5 in phase , similar to the @xmath13-ray peaks ,",
    "were apparently seen in the optical b band ( shearer et al .",
    "1998 ) , but those observations were compromised by a very high variable background .",
    "it is interesting to compare the multiwavelength nonthermal radiation of geminga with theoretical models .",
    "for instance , the outer gap model by zhang & cheng ( 2001 ) predicts one nonthermal x - ray peak coinciding in phase with the @xmath13-ray peak 1 and one soft thermal x - ray peak centered at the phase of the @xmath13-ray peak 2 .",
    "however , we see two nonthermal x - ray peaks , while the presumably thermal x - ray peak is centered in the middle between peak 1 and peak 2 .",
    "the latter property is expected in the polar cap models for high - energy radiation , which assume that both nonthermal x - rays and @xmath13-rays are emitted along a hollow cone inscribed in the surface formed by the last open field lines ( harding & muslimov 1998 ) . in this model , the two nonthermal peaks are seen at the phases when the line of sight is tangent to the cone at the site where the radiation is generated ( a few ns radii from the surface ) , which implies that only one pole is visible ( i.e. , the angles between the rotaion and magnetic axes and rotation axis and line of sight are @xmath326 ) .",
    "the different separation between the x - ray peaks , in comparison with that of the @xmath13-ray peaks , might mean that they are generated at a different distance from the ns ( e.g. , closer to the ns if the higher of the two 28 kev peaks corresponds to the @xmath13-ray peak 1 ) while their larger widths suggest that the x - rays are less beamed than the @xmath13-rays .",
    "we might speculate that the two peaks become even broader and closer in the nuv band , so that they appear as one peak , but such a trend is not seen in the optical .",
    "alternatively , the soft x - ray pulsations may still be magnetospheric in origin .",
    "this is , in fact , natural in the outer magnetosphere picture of romani and yadigaroglu ( 1995 ) . in their model",
    "the closest polar cap approach is @xmath327 before the @xmath13-ray peak 1 , while the cap producing the observed @xmath13-ray emission passes @xmath328 later , at @xmath329 in figure 12 .",
    "these phases are close to the primary and possible secondary uv minima of figure 8 . in the dyks and rudak ( 2003 ) two - pole model ,",
    "the @xmath13-ray peaks arise from opposite hemispheres , but the phase of closest pole approach is rather similar . in either case , it seems natural to interpret these minima as the result of scattering screens above the polar caps removing flux (  4.1.2 )",
    ". it would be very surprising if the fuv pulse minimum level represented the true rayleigh - jeans surface flux ( with the broad peaks being hot cap or non - thermal emission ) , as this would require a remarkably low ns temperature . in this interpretation",
    "there would be a distribution of soft non - thermal components dominating the x - ray pulse , mimicking here the th component and perturbing the fit of the ts component .",
    "little if any of the pulsed emission would come from a thermal cap .",
    "the ( unpulsed ) x - ray surface emission would be about 30% lower than that fitted for the ts component , allowing better agreement with the rayleigh - jeans uv flux in figure 9 .",
    "higher statistics fuv phase - resolved spectra are required to determine whether the closest approach of the magnetic axis to the line of sight is associated with the fuv minima or the soft x - ray maxima .",
    "the results of our work can be summarized as follows .",
    "the stis / mama observations of geminga have allowed us to detect , for the first time , its fuv radiation , measure the fuv spectrum and nuv flux , and detect fuv and nuv pulsations .",
    "we also measured the flux in the acs / wfc f555w band . to understand the multiwavelength properties of the geminga s radiation",
    ", we analyzed its x - ray spectrum and pulsations observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_.    \\2 .",
    "the phase - integrated nir through fuv spectrum consists of two components , thermal and nonthermal .",
    "the thermal component , which dominates at @xmath173  , is emitted from the ns surface .",
    "its flux corresponds to a brightness temperature @xmath330@xmath331 mk .",
    "the nonthermal component , which is likely generated in the pulsar s magnetosphere , shows a pl spectrum with photon index @xmath3321.6 and dominates at nir - optical wavelengths .",
    "we do not confirm the previously claimed spectral feature in the v band .",
    "the phase - integrated x - ray spectrum is dominated by a thermal soft component at @xmath333 kev , with a blackbody temperature @xmath334 mk and radius @xmath335 km .",
    "extrapolation of this spectrum into the optical - uv domain slightly overpredicts the thermal component of the observed uv spectrum , in contrast to all the other nss observed in both x - ray and optical - uv ranges .",
    "this might be associated with the very low temperature or a different chemical composition of the geminga s surface . under the assumption that the blackbody model properly describes the thermal spectra",
    "while the nonthermal spectrum is a simple power law , an additional thermal component is required to fit the x - ray spectrum , with a higher temperature , @xmath336 mk , and a small size of the emitting region , @xmath337 m. it is not clear whether this component is real or it appears because the simplified model spectra were used in the fits .",
    "indeed , several soft non - thermal components could contribute to the x - ray emission , leaving the residual thermal surface flux in better agreement with the uv rayleigh - jeans emission .",
    "the slope of the x - ray nonthermal component , which dominates at @xmath338 kev , is not well constrained , @xmath3392.0 , because of a large background at these energies and , possibly , some deviations of the spectrum from a simple pl model .",
    "its extrapolation into the nir - optical domain is either marginally consistent with the observed fluxes or goes above these fluxes , requiring a flattening of the nonthermal spectrum with decreasing photon energy .",
    "most likely , the optical radiation and the x - rays are emitted by the same population of relativistic particles in the geminga s magnetosphere and generated by the same mechanism .",
    "on the other side , the continuations of the nonthermal x - ray and @xmath13-ray spectra do not match smoothly , which suggests different radiation mechanisms in these energy bands .",
    "unexpectedly , we detected strong pulsations in the fuv band .",
    "the light curve of the predominantly thermal fuv radiation , with a narrow , deep minimum and possibly another minimum shifted by about half a period , differs significantly from the light curve of the thermal soft x - ray radiation , which shows one broad , smooth peak per period , possibly distorted by a small contribution from the magnetospheric component .",
    "because the fuv pulsations can hardly be explained by an anisotropic temperature and/or magnetic field distributions , we suggest that they could be associated with a resonance scattering of the thermal uv photons in the ns magnetosphere .",
    "the light curve of the nonthermal x - ray emission shows two peaks , as the @xmath13-ray light curve , but the x - ray peaks are substantially broader , and their separation differs significantly from the half - period separation of the @xmath13-ray peaks .",
    "at least one of the nonthermal peaks is apparently seen at lower x - ray energies , superimposed on the broader peak of thermal emission .",
    "we see no clear connection between the nonthermal x - ray pulsations and single - peaked nuv pulsations .",
    "two peaks have been apparently seen in the optical , but this very noisy light curve is badly in need of confirmation .    to conclude , the _ hst _ stis / mama observations have allowed us to study the uv spectrum and pulsations of geminga . combined with the results of the previous optical and @xmath13-ray observations and our analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data , this study has provided a connection between different energy bands for the thermal and magnetospheric components and elucidated the multiwavelength picture of the geminga s radiation .",
    "however , some important properties of this radiation remain unclear .",
    "first , the true nature of the uv ( particularly fuv ) pulsations is still uncertain . to understand it , phase - resolved spectroscopy of the fuv radiation would be particularly useful , which would require deeper fuv - mama observations , quite feasible with the _ hst _ stis if it is brought back to life in a future servicing mission .",
    "second , it remains unclear whether we indeed see a small , high - temperature polar cap or this is an artifact caused by the use of simplified spectral models . to answer this question we need realistic models for thermal and nonthermal x - ray radiation and phase - resolved spectroscopy at @xmath340 kev with high s / n .",
    "third , we do not understand the connection between the nonthermal x - ray emission and @xmath13-ray emission .",
    "this problem could be resolved by observations in a 10 kev  10 mev band with a future mission equipped with detectors more sensitive in this energy range than the detectors of the _ rxte _ and _ integral _ missions .",
    ", for example , should be able to offer sensitive measurements in the hard x - ray range .",

    "<S> we observed the gamma - ray pulsar geminga with the fuv - mama and nuv - mama detectors of the space telescope imaging spectrometer to measure the geminga s spectrum and pulsations in the ultraviolet . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectrum is close to that of a rayleigh - jeans spectrum , suggesting that the fuv radiation is dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star ( ns ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> the measured fuv flux , @xmath0 ergs @xmath1 s@xmath2 in 11551702  band , corresponds to a brightness temperature @xmath3@xmath4 mk , depending on the interstellar extinction ( @xmath5 pc and @xmath6 km are the distance and the ns radius ) . the soft thermal component of the geminga s x - ray spectrum measured with the _ xmm - newton _ observatory corresponds to a temperature @xmath7 mk and radius @xmath8 km . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to other nss detected in the uv - optical , for which the extrapolation of x - ray thermal component into the optical underpredicts the observed flux of thermal radiation , the fuv spectrum of geminga lies slightly below the extrapolation of the soft thermal component , which might be associated with the geminga s very low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the thermal fuv radiation is strongly pulsed , showing a narrow dip at a phase close to that of a broader minimum of the soft x - ray light curve . </S>",
    "<S> the strong pulsations might be attributed to partial occultations of the thermal uv radiation by regions of the magnetosphere filled with electron / positron plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the fuv spectrum , the near - infrared ( nir ) through near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) spectrum of geminga is clearly nonthermal . </S>",
    "<S> it can be described by a power - law model , @xmath9 , with a photon index @xmath10 , close to the slope @xmath11 of the hard x - ray ( @xmath12 kev ) magnetospheric component . </S>",
    "<S> the extrapolation of the x - ray magnetospheric spectrum into the optical is marginally consistent with ( perhaps lies slightly above ) the observed nir - optical - nuv spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the nuv pulsations , however , do not show a clear correlation with the hard x - ray pulsations . </S>"
