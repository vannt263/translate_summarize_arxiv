    "a full discussion and comparison is presented in k15 , but it is worth noting that , given similar initial conditions , the models of k15 agree with to within a factor of 3 .",
    "if large - scale magnetic fields are present , the assumption of radial symmetry during collapse will not hold , as flux - freezing prevents significant collapse in directions perpendicular to the field .",

    "the thermal velocity dispersion is sufficiently small ( @xmath134  km  s@xmath49 ) that the broadening has only a modest effect .",
    "the projection direction has a pronounced effect , as the dispersion in the @xmath135-direction ( parallel to the magnetic field ) is much wider than in the @xmath136-direction .",
    "this may be attributed to material collapsing freely along the magnetic field lines .",
    "there are also noticeable differences between the n@xmath0h@xmath1 and n@xmath0d@xmath1 spectra ; the n@xmath0d@xmath1 spectra exhibit more small scale structures than the n@xmath0h@xmath1 . as will be discussed in  [ ss : chemicalevo ] , n@xmath0h@xmath1 largely reaches equilibrium throughout the core , whereas n@xmath0d@xmath1 does not ; n@xmath0d@xmath1 may therefore probe smaller and denser structures within the core .",

    "the effective radius decreases as the core collapses .",
    "the effective core mass also decreases due to the central concentration of the n@xmath0d@xmath1 tracer .",
    "the core is initialized with a velocity dispersion @xmath143 ; yet by @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",

    "however , for the case of the massive core c1-s , t13 found @xmath148 and argued this may imply the presence of strong ( @xmath149  mg ) , large - scale magnetic fields . here , we observe that after the initial turbulent energy injection , the fiducial core ( run s3m2 ) appears moderately sub - virial but later becomes super - virial as the core collapses .",
    "the simulation with a stronger magnetic field ( run s3m1 ) , which is discussed in more detail in  [ ss : mageffect ] , shows an even more sub - virial velocity dispersion when viewed in the @xmath120 and @xmath122 directions , consistent with the t13 estimate for c1-s .",
    "the evolution of the fiducial run is further quantified in figure [ f : meanevo ] , which shows the evolution of both the mean and maximum values of the mass surface density , chemical abundances , and @xmath15 in the core .",
    "here we define the core using the effective number density threshold @xmath150 ; as this selects a unique volume , the mean column density is independent of viewing angle .",
    "maximum values are computed from the @xmath120-axis projections .",
    "the mean mass surface density of the core decreases initially due to the initial turbulence and then increases slowly with time , from @xmath151  g  @xmath34 up to 0.8  g  @xmath34 .",

    ", the growth rates of the chemical species also increase .",
    "we observe in figures [ f : s3m2timesnaps1 ] and [ f : s3m2timesnaps3 ] that n@xmath0h@xmath1 reaches equilibrium before n@xmath0d@xmath1 and is more widespread .",
    "this agrees well with observations of pre - stellar core regions ; k16 find an extended envelope of n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission around cores in irdc g028.37 + 00.07 , while n@xmath0d@xmath1 is more concentrated .",
    "the asymmetry introduced by the magnetic field also affects the chemical morphology ; when viewing perpendicular to the field , the chemical tracers are more centrally - concentrated .",
    "the chemical evolution is also quantified in figure [ f : meanevo ] .",
    "the mean n@xmath0h@xmath1 column density increases rapidly and then flattens over time as equilibrium is reached ; in contrast , the mean n@xmath0d@xmath1 column density grows steadily throughout the simulation without reaching equilibrium , and @xmath15 increases only modestly until late times ( after n@xmath0h@xmath1 has reached equilibrium ) .",
    "the maximum values of n@xmath0d@xmath1 and @xmath15 do reach equilibrium values , but this is limited to only the densest regions of the core .",
    "this is confirmed in figure [ f : colpdftime ] , which shows only a small fraction of cells in the core are able to reach @xmath15@xmath153 by the end of the simulation .",
    "as k16 detected widespread deuteration in pre - stellar cores ( see also the study of @xcite for evidence of widespread deuteration on parsec - sized , lower - density scales in an irdc ) , this suggests more time is needed for the outer regions of the core to reach observed values .",
    "figure [ f : radavgtime ] presents radial averages of @xmath15 within the core at different times and projection directions .",
    "@xmath15 grows rapidly in the center of the core , where the density is highest , while in the outer regions , @xmath15remains relatively unchanged for the duration of the simulation .",
    "the direction of projection does not significantly affect the radial profile , which suggests observed radial profiles could be a useful ( viewing - angle - independent ) means to constrain the age of the core .",
    "radial mapping of @xmath15 within observed cores is now technically feasible with alma .",
    "and k15 found that the initial ortho - to - para ratio of h@xmath0 ( opr@xmath62 ) strongly affected the chemical evolution of n@xmath0d@xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "our fiducial simulation has opr@xmath62",
    "as the hydrodynamics is unaffected by the chemistry , we simultaneously evolve the molecular species using opr@xmath62  =  0.01 and opr@xmath62  =  1.0 .",
    "the evolution of the mean values of n@xmath0d@xmath1 and @xmath15 at different opr@xmath62 is shown in figure [ f : meanevo ] .",
    "as noted by k15 , a lower opr@xmath62 leads to faster growth of n@xmath0d@xmath1 , as well as a larger equilibrium value of [ n@xmath0d@xmath1 ] .",
    "since n@xmath0h@xmath1 is unchanged by opr@xmath62 , @xmath15 also grows faster and reaches a higher value .",
    "the mean value of @xmath15 remains below the observed values ( @xmath14 ) even at the lowest opr@xmath62 ( = 0.01 ) , indicating a longer core lifetime and/or earlier deuteration ( see  [ ss : tchemeffect ] ) is necessary .",
    "the effect of varying opr@xmath62 is also presented in figure [ f : dfraccompare ] , which shows the ratio of chemical column densities ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) at the end of the fiducial simulation for varying opr@xmath62 . from the top row moving down , opr@xmath62 decreases for a given chemical age , with a corresponding increase in the mean deuterium fraction in the core .",
    "we have thus far assumed in our calculations that the gas begins in an initially pristine condition , with @xmath121 , i.e. , [ n@xmath0h@xmath1]=[n@xmath0d@xmath1]=0.0 at @xmath102",
    ". however , this may not be the case , especially given our initial condition ; we initialize the core after it has already formed a centrally - concentrated structure .",
    "deuteration begins once co begins to freeze - out , which occurred at some unknown time prior to the current state .",
    "we therefore explore different `` chemical ages '' for the core : @xmath154 0 , 1 , 3 , and 10  @xmath104 . to set the initial condition for the chemical abundances , we reference the constant density results of k15 at an absolute time , as described in  [ ss : chemistry ] .",
    "the core then begins from an advanced state of deuteration , assuming the core has been in its current density configuration for @xmath103 . while the dynamical collapse is unchanged , the core is able to reach higher deuterium fractions .",
    "as is evident in figure [ f : dfraccompare ] , the deuterium fraction increases for increasing chemical age , with nearly the entire core achieving the equilibrium value of @xmath15 for @xmath155 . while this may seem to agree with the estimates of k15 , which indicated up to 10 free - fall times",
    "may be necessary to reach observed values of @xmath15 , the simulations are not directly comparable . in k15 ,",
    "the density continually increases , with a corresponding decrease in @xmath104 ; here , we assume a constant density ( hence a constant @xmath104 ) prior to initialization .",

    "the average core free - fall time then increases to @xmath161  kyr .",

    "run s1m2 appears more filamentary and less centrally concentrated than run s3m2 .",

    "depending on the value of @xmath103 and opr@xmath62 , @xmath15 is higher in run s1m2 by a factor of 1 - 5 over run s3m2 .",

    ", the stronger magnetic field leads to an initial expansion of the core before it coalesces again and collapses .",
    "the critical field does slow the contraction  both simulations run @xmath167 past the corresponding @xmath168 simulations  but ultimately does not prevent collapse .",
    "the slower collapse leads to a larger , more diffuse core compared to the fiducial run at a given time .",
    "the stronger field also inhibits motions perpendicular to the field , as illustrated in figure [ f : sigmaevo ] .",
    "the velocity dispersions in the @xmath120 and @xmath122 directions are lower in run s3m1 compared to run s3m2 , while the @xmath65 direction is largely unaffected .",

    "we conclude that the magnetic field strength does not strongly affect the resulting deuterium fraction . however , we caution that this result may be influenced by the initial field geometry ( see  [ s : discussion ] ) , and further investigation is warranted .",

    "5 of k15 also demonstrates the effect of changing the cosmic ray ionization rate @xmath174 ; increasing @xmath174 will both decrease the equilibrium value of @xmath15and increase the growth rate of @xmath15 .",
    "we also note that the k15 fiducial parameter values may not be applicable across the full range of densities ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "short of implementing the full network in 3d mhd simulations , future work could introduce density - dependent parameters to better span the k15 parameter space .",
    "finally , our parameterization introduces a systematic overestimate of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and underestimate of @xmath15 , by up to 30% relative error .",
    "while the approximation is expedient for simulations , a time - dependent chemical network will be required to obtain more accurate species evolution as the density evolves .",
    "the cores begin with a smooth density profile , and we rely on the initial super - virial turbulent velocity field to create density fluctuations .",

    "material freely collapses along the field lines even when the field is of critical strength .",
    "future studies should begin either with a tangled component in addition to an ordered component , or should generate a tangled field through turbulent driving @xcite .",

    "it is unclear how the protostellar radiation field will affect the deuteration process ; however , there is recent evidence that protostars can exist within highly - deuterated regions @xcite .",
    "radiation effects could increase the core lifetime and hence the deuterium fraction , and future studies following the chemistry for longer periods should include these effects using sink particles and radiation - magnetohydrodynamics .",
