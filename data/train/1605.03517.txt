    "a quantum particle in a periodical potential driven by a constant force performs an oscillatory motion instead of uniformly accelerated motion .",
    "this oscillation is known as bloch oscillation @xcite . long after its theoretical prediction",
    ", it was observed in some physical systems such as superlattice @xcite , ultracold @xcite and optical systems @xcite .",
    "if the system is subjected to an oscillating force instead of the constant force , then localization occurs at some certain oscillation frequencies .",
    "this kind of localization is known as dynamical localization and its physical origin is different from anderson localization @xcite .",
    "the combined presence of both constant and oscillating forces leads to the photon - assisted tunneling . in this case ,",
    "wave packet delocalization occurs for an initially localized wave packet when modulation frequency is at multiple integers of the bloch frequency @xcite .",
    "another interesting effect is the super bloch oscillations , which arises when an integer multiple of the oscillation frequency is only slightly detuned from the bloch frequency associated with the constant force @xcite .",
    "note that the amplitude of super bloch oscillation is much larger than that of bloch oscillation .",
    "it was experimentally realized in an ultracold system , where a giant matter - wave oscillation ( super bloch oscillation ) that extend over hundreds of lattice sites was observed @xcite .",
    "a generalization of super bloch oscillation to correlated particles was considered in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the theoretical analysis of the hermitian case . + the experimental realizations of non - hermitian @xmath0 symmetric optical systems @xcite have triggered interests in the investigation of oscillatory dynamics in @xmath0 symmetric systems .",
    "bloch oscilation in a @xmath0 symmetric complex crystal was first addressed theoretically in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that either amplified or damped bloch oscillation occurs depending on the sign of the constant force .",
    "this is simply due to broken @xmath0 symmetry by the external force that leads to the appearance of complex wannier stark ( ws ) ladders .",
    "bloch oscillations were also shown to display unusual features such as non - reciprocal cycles related to a violation of friedel s law of bragg scattering and cascade of wave packet splittings .",
    "bloch oscillations for a non - hermitian infinitely - extended , ring and truncated tight - binding lattices with unidirectional hopping were investigated @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the oscillatory motion is not secularly damped nor amplified for that system as a result of the equally - spaced real wannier - stark ladder .",
    "it is well known that the acceleration theorem explains bloch oscillation semi - classically for hermitian lattice .",
    "an extension of the the acceleration theorem to non - hermitian lattices was discussed and bloch oscillation for the generalized non - hermitian hatano and nelson was specifically studied @xcite .",
    "another theoretical paper investigated bloch - zener oscillation for locally @xmath0 symmetric system @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 symmetric bloch oscillation is not only theoretical interests .",
    "it was also experimentally realized in @xcite .",
    "although the non - hermitian hamiltonian considered in @xcite is @xmath0 symmetric , the total power was observed to be changed in time . in the experiment @xcite ,",
    "pseudo - hermitian wave packet propagation with a vanishing net increase in power was observed by controlling the period of the bloch oscillation in a global and local @xmath0 symmetric mesh lattice . a resonant restoration of @xmath0 symmetry and secondary emissions , which occurs each time the wave packet passes through the exceptional point",
    "was also observed in that experiment . another interesting dynamical effect in solid state and optical systems",
    "is the dynamic localization effect . the dynamic localization for non - hermitian @xmath0 symmetric systems have been investigated by various authors @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the reality of the quasi - energy spectrum is preserved by the @xmath0 symmetry and bragg scattering in the crystal becomes highly nonreciprocal at the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking point @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we study another interesting dynamical effect , super bloch oscillation , for a complex lattice .",
    "bloch oscillation in non - hermitian lattices is generally either amplified or damped because of complex wanner - stark ladders . here",
    ", we show that undamped / non - amplified large amplitude oscillation occurs in a non - hermitian lattice if certain conditions are satisfied .",
    "consider an array of tight - binding one dimensional lattice with alternating gain and loss .",
    "the system is also subject to a time - dependent force .",
    "the non - hermitian hamiltonian for our system is given by @xmath1 where the constant @xmath2 is tunneling amplitude through which particles are transferred between neighboring sites , @xmath3 is a real valued time - dependent force , @xmath4 is the distance between the centers of adjacent sites and the real constant @xmath5 is non - hermitian degree describing the strength of the gain / loss materials .",
    "note that the same hamiltonian can also describe an array of optical waveguides if the time parameter @xmath6 is replaced with the propagation distance @xmath7 . + let us first study the reality of the spectrum of this non - hermitian hamiltonian",
    ". as a result of the balanced gain and loss , the non - hermitian hamiltonian becomes @xmath0 symmetric if no force exists @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the corresponding spectrum is real unless @xmath9 exceeds a critical value @xmath10 , which corresponds to the transition from unbroken to broken @xmath0 symmetry . in the presence of force , the reality of the spectrum depends on the form of the force .",
    "for example , a time - independent force , @xmath11 , breaks @xmath0 symmetry and consequently complex - conjugate eigenvalues appear . in other words ,",
    "wannier - stark ladders become complex - valued and then a localized wave packet is amplified / damped during bloch oscillation .",
    "the physics changes significantly if the force changes periodically in time . in this case , the energy spectrum is replaced by a quasi - energy spectrum , which is real for a wide range of parameters @xcite . at some certain parameters of the hamiltonian ,",
    "dynamic localization was shown to occur . in this paper",
    ", we suppose that the force is composed of both a constant and an oscillating terms @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the modulation frequency , @xmath14 is an integer , the constant @xmath15 is the strength of the oscillating term and @xmath16 is the initial phases .",
    "apparently , the constant term in ( [ revf241 ] ) breaks the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "so , one expects that the system has zero threshold for @xmath0 symmetry breaking , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "this means that wave packet is either amplified or damped during oscillation .",
    "however , this is not the case since pseudo @xmath0 symmetry guarantees the reality of the corresponding spectrum as it was shown in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "pseudo @xmath0 symmetry allows us to study large amplitude oscillation of a wave packet that is neither damped nor amplified .",
    "+ we now show that the spectrum in our system is real .",
    "one can use high - frequency floquet approach to construct a time - independent effective hamiltonian to study the spectrum of the periodical hamiltonian . in this approach , which is valid",
    "if @xmath13 is large , the tunneling parameter is replaced by an effective tunneling parameter , @xmath18 @xcite @xmath19 where star denotes the complex conjugate and the effective tunneling is given by @xmath20 where overline denotes the average over time and @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 .",
    "to evaluate the integral ( [ efftun ] ) , we use the jacobi - anger expansion ; @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the @xmath25-th order bessel function of first kind .",
    "if we expand the oscillatory term @xmath26 in terms of bessel functions and take the time average of the integration , we get the effective tunneling expression @xmath27 we conclude that the force ( [ revf241 ] ) modifies the tunneling amplitude in the hamiltonian . as it was discussed above , this type of force breaks the @xmath0 symmetry of the original hamiltonian .",
    "however , this @xmath0 symmetry breaking term is absent in the effective hamiltonian . the system is called pseudo @xmath0 symmetric , which arises when not the original hamiltonian but the effective hamiltonian is @xmath0 symmetric @xcite . + the absolute value of the effective tunneling parameter changes with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the bessel function @xmath30 is roughly like a decaying sine function . in the absence of the oscillating force term , @xmath31 ,",
    "the bessel function is always zero , @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the effective tunneling is suppressed and the spectrum becomes complex .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the broken @xmath0 symmetry that occurs when @xmath33 changes from zero to nonzero .",
    "note that vanishing @xmath34 does not mean entire destruction of tunneling because of the neglected off - resonant terms in the derivation of the effective tunneling .",
    "the tunneling is partially restored and the system enters the pseudo @xmath0 symmetric phase with the additional application of oscillating force term .",
    "this is the region where we study super bloch oscillation .",
    "we emphasize that the pseudo @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken whenever @xmath28 is a root of bessel function of order @xmath33 since the effective tunneling vanishes .",
    "+ having derived the effective hamiltonian , we can discuss the reality of the spectrum .",
    "for an infinitely extended lattice , the energy eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian are composed by two minibands and given by @xmath35 .",
    "therefore the spectrum is complex at any @xmath5 for the periodical lattice . if the system , on the other hand , is truncated , the spectrum of the effective system becomes real provided that non - hermitian degree is below than a critical number . if it is beyond the critical number , spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking occurs and the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are no longer simultaneous eigenfunction of @xmath0 operator .",
    "the energy spectrum of the effective hamiltonian ( [ ameffh ] ) for the truncated lattice can be found numerically . in our system , the critical value decreases with increasing number of truncated lattice sites . as @xmath36 , the critical value goes to zero .",
    "a discussion and analytical formula for open and periodical boundary conditions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the above formalism is valid when @xmath37 .",
    "it does not account for the dynamics of the system , either .",
    "however , it gives an insight to us on the reality of the spectrum .",
    "this motivates us to study undamped / non - amplified super bloch oscillation in our non - hermitian system .",
    "below , we study the dynamics of the system numerically .",
    "to observe super bloch oscillation , the frequency @xmath38 should be slightly detuned from the bloch frequency . to satisfy this off - resonance condition",
    ", we can make the following replacement in the expression ( [ revf241 ] ) : @xmath39 , where the parameter @xmath40 is a small detuning .",
    "the detuning @xmath41 makes the amplitude of oscillation much larger than that of bloch oscillation as can be seen below .",
    "we stress that @xmath41 acts perturbatively to the effective hamiltonian ( [ ameffh ] ) and hence we say that corresponding spectrum changes slightly .",
    "+ let us first review the super bloch oscillation briefly for the hermitian system .",
    "the semiclassical explanation for the super bloch oscillation is as follows . in the absence of gain and loss , @xmath42 , the energy expression for the tight binding lattice",
    "is given by @xmath43 , where the quasi - momentum @xmath44 changes with the force according to @xmath45 .",
    "then the instantaneous group velocity for the force ( [ revf241 ] ) reads @xmath46 ( we set @xmath47 for simplicity ) .",
    "one can compute the average of @xmath48 over one period using the jacobi - anger relation .",
    "then the mean position of the wave packet can be found using @xmath49 , where overline denotes average @xmath50 this expression clearly shows us why the oscillation is called super bloch oscillation .",
    "this is because of the fact that the amplitude of the oscillation scales with the inverse of the detuning @xmath41 .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation can be enhanced and oscillation with a giant amplitude can be observed if the detuning is made small enough . not only the amplitude but also the period of the super bloch oscillation is large . the higher the amplitude of the oscillation , the larger the period is .",
    "+ the semi - classical picture for the hermitian lattice @xcite can not be directly generalized to a non - hermitian lattice as discussed in @xcite .",
    "below , we perform numerical computation to investigate super bloch oscillation for the non - hermitian truncated lattices .",
    "we take @xmath51 and @xmath52 from now on .",
    "let us first write the solution as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the lattice site number .",
    "the corresponding equation for the time - dependent coefficients @xmath55 can be obtained by substituting this expansion into the schrodinger - like equation , @xmath56 .",
    "suppose first that @xmath42 . the fig .",
    "1 depicts the evolution of a wave packet ( snapshot of @xmath57 ) for a single site initial input , @xmath58 for the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 . for comparison , the intensity profile for bloch ( @xmath31 ) and super bloch oscillations ( @xmath61 )",
    "are shown in the figure .",
    "the presence of the constant force forms the wannier - stark ladder and therefore bloch oscillation occurs as can be seen from the upper panel .",
    "the additional presence of the oscillating force together with the detuning @xmath62 makes the amplitude of this oscillation larger . as can be seen from the lower panel ,",

    "if it exceeds the critical value , amplification / damping occurs .",
    "consider first @xmath66 . in this case , energy spectrum is real and we do nt expect exponential growth of the total particle number .",
    "we numerically compute time evolution for a single site and a broad gaussian initial excitations .",
    "the figure-2 plots the breathing and oscillatory super bloch oscillation corresponding to an initial single - site and broad - site excitations of the lattice . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "large amplitude oscillation similar to the one in the hermitian lattice occurs .",
    "however , we find that particle number is not conserved but changes slightly with time .",
    "this is because of the fact that eigenstates of non - hermitian hamiltonian are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "a similar effect was also observed in an experiment on bloch oscillation for a @xmath0 symmetric hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that non - conservation of the total particle number breaks the exact self - imaging property of the lattice .",
    "however , this effect is weak and the oscillation is almost periodical if @xmath66 .",
    "note that the amplitude of the oscillation can be made higher by choosing the detuning @xmath67 smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "however , our lattice is truncated and once the wave packet reaches the lattice boundary , the oscillating character of the wave packet is lost . to sum up ,",
    "we show that although ( small amplitude ) stable bloch oscillation does not occur in our non - hermitian lattice , large amplitude bloch oscillation is possible in the same system .",
    "this is the main finding of this paper .",
    "suppose next that the effective system is in the spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetric phase , @xmath69 , where pairs of complex - conjugate eigenvalues appear . in this case ,",
    "wave packet is amplified during the oscillation .",
    "in fact , the total number of particles grows exponentially at almost every lattice sites even if only single site is initially excited .",
    "therefore , super bloch oscillation does not occur in this case .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath9 is very close to @xmath10 , we can still observe at least a few cycle large amplitude oscillation .",
    "as time goes on , new particles that appear at every lattice sites become too much and oscillatory motion of the wave packet is consequently destroyed .",
    "the fig-3 shows numerical simulation for this case when the initial wave function is gaussian .",
    "as can be seen , the wave packet undergoes high amplitude oscillations in real space and secondary emission occurs .",

    "can also be investigated .",
    "let us mention them briefly .",
    "the dynamic localization appears in the presence of the oscillating force , @xmath71 . at some particular strength of the oscillating force ,",
    "an initially localized wave - packet stops spreading in time .",
    "in other words , the system is in the dynamically localized regime if the effective tunneling vanishes , which occurs whenever @xmath72 is a root of the bessel function of order @xmath29 .",
    "note that the phase @xmath73 plays no role on dynamic localization .",
    "if the effective tunneling is zero , then the critical point @xmath74 is zero , too .",
    "we numerically solve our equation for @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "( note that @xmath77 ) .",
    "we see that the total number of particles grow exponentially just as @xmath9 becomes different from zero .",
    "secondly , let us mention about photon assisted tunneling .",
    "it is well known that the translational symmetry of the lattice is broken and tunneling is consequently suppressed by the presence of the constant force .",
    "thus , an initially localized wave - packet remains localized in the hermitian lattice .",
    "however , tunneling is partially restored if an additional oscillating force is also present in the system .",
    "this effect is known as photon assisted tunneling @xcite since the role of the photons is played by the oscillation of the force at resonant frequencies . in our system ,",
    "partial restoration of the tunneling increases @xmath74 . in the presence of only constant force , @xmath78 and the corresponding wannier - stark ladder",
    "are complex , while the additional oscillating force switches @xmath74 from zero value to a non - zero value .",
    "+ in conclusion , the main finding of our paper is the existence of non - amplified super bloch oscillation in a @xmath0 symmetric lattice even though bloch oscillation is amplified in the same lattice . in a non - hermitian lattice , the standard semi - classical picture does not work .",
    "using the high - frequency floquet analysis , we have shown that super bloch oscillation can occur if the non - hermitian system is in pseudo @xmath0 symmetric region .",
    "we have numerically seen that the super bloch oscillation in our system with @xmath66 is very similar to the one in the hermitian lattice , @xmath42 with the exception that the particle number changes little because of the nonorthogonality of eigenvectors .",
    "we have discussed that super bloch oscillation in our non - hermitian tight binding lattice is destroyed if @xmath79 . on the other hand",
    ", we have shown that a few cycle super bloch oscillation with secondary emission that has no analogue in a hermitian system can be observed if @xmath5 is very close to @xmath74 .",
    "we have also discussed dynamic localization and photon assisted tunneling in our non - hermitian system .",
