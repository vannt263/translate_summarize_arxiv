    "it is well - known that a very strong magnetic field may appear on the surface of neutron stars , @xmath10 g .",
    "it seems natural to expect that in a vicinity of the surface some atomic and molecular systems can occur . for many years",
    "this assumption has motivated a development of atomic - molecular physics in a strong magnetic field hoping that it might lead to understanding of the spectra of these compact stars and be important for a construction of a model of the atmosphere .",
    "recent revolutionary observation of the absorption features in a spectra of the isolated neutron star 1e1207.4 - 5209 by chandra @xmath11-ray observatory @xcite brought an extra attention to the field .",
    "so far , a major attention has been paid to a study of one - electron atomic and molecular systems ( for a review , see @xcite ) . during the last years the existence of several exotic , strongly bound one - electron molecular systems has been predicted . in particular , it was shown that for a sufficiently strong magnetic field @xmath12 the exotic ion @xmath13 can exist in parallel configuration ( the magnetic field is directed along internuclear axis ) as optimal as well as its excited states @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a complete list of possible one - electron atomic and molecular systems is known for @xmath15 g . in turn , the exploration of two - electron systems has been mostly restricted to a study of atomic - type systems h@xmath16he with the only exception of the h@xmath17 molecule ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . recently ,",
    "a first detailed study of the molecular ions h@xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 @xcite has been carried out ( for a brief review of a general situation see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that for large magnetic fields if such an ion exists its optimal configuration is the linear parallel one - heavy charged particles are situated along a magnetic line .",
    "a goal of the present paper is to make a study of the coulomb system @xmath20 in a magnetic field ranging in @xmath21 g and thus to establish the possible existence of the simplest two - electron diatomic heteronuclear molecular ion @xmath22 and to explore its lowest excited states . in the field - free case the theoretical existence of @xmath22",
    "was established long ago by beach @xcite ( see also @xcite ) while its several excited states were found ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "experimentally , this molecular ion was first observed in the mass spectra of helium - hydrogen mixtures ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1 ion is thought to be among the first molecular species to appear in the universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an attempt to explore the @xmath22 ion in ultra - strong magnetic field was made in @xcite .",
    "atomic units are used throughout ( @xmath23=@xmath24=@xmath25=1 ) , although energies are expressed in rydbergs ( ry ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath26 is given in a.u . with @xmath27",
    "we study the system @xmath20 placed in a uniform constant magnetic field .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath2-particle and proton are infinitely massive ( born - oppenheimer approximation of zero order ) .",
    "it seems natural from physical point of view that the optimal configuration is parallel when the @xmath2-particle and proton are situated along the magnetic field line .",
    "nevertheless a stability of this configuration with respect to small perturbations will be checked .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the system @xmath20 when the magnetic field is oriented along the @xmath28 direction , @xmath29 is @xmath30 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : h3pp ] for the geometrical setting and notations ) , where @xmath31 is the momentum of the @xmath32-th - electron , the index @xmath33 runs over the @xmath2-particle and proton , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the interelectronic distance , @xmath36 is the operator of the total spin .",
    "the vector potential @xmath37 which corresponds to the constant uniform magnetic field @xmath38 is chosen in the symmetric gauge , @xmath39     geometrical setting for the @xmath1 ion parallel to a magnetic field directed along the @xmath28-axis .",
    "the @xmath2-particle and the proton ( marked by bullets ) are situated on the @xmath28-line at distance @xmath40 . ]    finally , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the z - components of the total angular momentum and total spin , respectively , and @xmath44 .",
    "the problem is characterized by two conserved quantities : ( i ) the operator of the @xmath28-component of the total angular momentum ( projection of the angular momentum on the magnetic field direction ) giving rise to the magnetic quantum number @xmath45 and ( ii ) the operator of the @xmath28-component of the total spin ( projection of the total spin on the magnetic field direction ) giving rise to the spin quantum number @xmath46 .",
    "hence , any eigenstate has two quantum numbers assigned : the magnetic quantum number @xmath45 and the spin quantum number @xmath46 .",
    "as the magnetic field increases a contribution from the linear zeeman term ( interaction of the spin with a magnetic field @xmath47 ) becomes more and more important .",
    "hence , it is natural to assume that for large magnetic fields the states with minimal @xmath46 ( when both electron spins are antiparallel to the magnetic field ) will represent the states with lowest total energies .",
    "the space of eigenstates is split into subspaces ( sectors ) with each of them characterized by definite values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , to classify eigenstates we follow the convention widely accepted in molecular physics using the quantum numbers @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the notation is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the spin multiplicity and corresponds to @xmath50 for singlet @xmath51 and @xmath52 for triplet @xmath53 , as for the labeling @xmath54 it is used the greek letters @xmath55 that correspond to the states with @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "we study only states with @xmath57 .    as a method to explore the problem we use the variational procedure .",
    "the recipe of choice of trial functions is based on physical arguments @xcite . a trial function for states with orbital magnetic quantum number @xmath45",
    "is chosen in the form @xmath58 ( cf.@xcite ) , where @xmath59 stand for spin singlet ( @xmath51 ) and triplet states @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath61 is the operator which interchanges electrons ( 1 @xmath62 2 ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 as well as the internuclear distance @xmath40 are eight variational parameters .",
    "calculations were performed using the minimization package minuit from cern - lib .",
    "multidimensional integration was carried out using a dynamical partitioning procedure : a domain of integration was divided into subdomains following the integrand profile and then each subdomain was integrated separately ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "numerical integration was done with a relative accuracy of @xmath66 by use of the adaptive d01fcf routine from nag - lib .",
    "computations were performed on a dual dell pc with two xeon processors of 2.8ghz each ( icn ) and dual dell pc with two xeon processors of 3.06ghz each ( cinvestav ) .",
    "we implemented a parallelization in the routine for the calculation of the integrals .",
    "minimization process for each particular magnetic field and for a given state was quite painful and lengthy , it took from 100 to 1000 hours of cpu time , however , when a minimum is found it was needed a few minutes to compute a minimal variational energy .",
    "in absence of a magnetic field the @xmath1 molecular ion exists and it is stable . its ground state is the @xmath5 ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) state @xcite . in order to establish the existence of @xmath1 in a magnetic field we carried out a detailed study of the coulomb system @xmath20 in parallel configuration in the state @xmath5 for magnetic fields @xmath69 a.u .",
    "( see table [ table1 ] ) . for this case the variational trial function @xmath70 ( 4 ) is used at @xmath71 and @xmath68 .",
    "the calculations indicate the optimal geometry is parallel ( @xmath2-particle and proton stay on the same magnetic line ) . for this configuration for all studied magnetic fields a minimum in the total energy curve @xmath72 is developed .",
    "furthermore , we checked that this minimum is stable with respect to small inclinations of the internuclear axis from the magnetic field direction .",
    "it is found that with an increase of the magnetic field strength the total energy of the @xmath20 system in the @xmath5 state grows , it becomes more bound ( in particular , the double ionization energy increases @xmath73 ) and the system becomes more compact ( the internuclear equilibrium distance decreases ) , see table  i. for @xmath74a.u .",
    "the @xmath20 system in the @xmath5 state is stable with respect to the dissociation @xmath75 + h or @xmath76 + p. the vibrational and rotational energies are calculated for @xmath77a.u .",
    "the vibrational energy is larger than the rotational energy which is typical for field - free case .",
