    "sic and the iii - v nitrides ( especially gan ) are the most promising wide band - gap semiconductors for short - wavelength optoelectronics and for high - power , high - temperature microelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "but it is difficult to grow high - quality single crystals of these materials .",
    "this is due to the polytypism occurring between zinc - blende ( abcabc ... sequence along the 111 direction , see fig.[structure]a ) and wurtzite structure ( ababab ... sequence along the 100 direction , see fig.[structure]b ) .",
    "sic shows many more complicated stacking sequences built up as a mixture between the fully cubic structure ( zinc - blende ) and the fully hexagonal structure ( wurtzite ) with different percentages of hexagonality .",
    "therefore it is important to understand the bulk properties of these materials , from a theoretical point of view , at least for the two simplest structures ( zinc - blende and wurtzite ) .",
    "+ over the past decade , _ ab initio _ calculations based on density functional theory with a local - density approximation ( lda ) have been performed for these materials . in some of them ,",
    "the energy differences between the zinc - blende and the wurtzite structure have been evaluated @xcite .",
    "there is no possibility to measure these energy differences , thus a complement by  and a comparison with  other _ ab initio _ methods is desirable . _",
    "ab initio _ hartree - fock self consistent field ( hf ) calculations for solids@xcite are feasible nowadays , using the program package crystal@xcite .",
    "they have the merit of treating the non - local exchange exactly although lacking electron correlations per definition . in lda calculations where both exchange and correlations are covered in an implicit way , a systematic improvement towards the exact results appears to be difficult . treating the non - local exchange",
    "exactly yields a better ( microscopic ) understanding of the electron interaction in these materials and , at the same time , leads to a good starting point for a post - hartree - fock correlation treatment .",
    "+ electron correlations can be taken into account explicitly using many - body wave - functions of the configuration - interaction or coupled - cluster type .",
    "these methods are well developed for finite systems like atoms and molecules .",
    "infinite systems such as solids require a size - consistent approach which is achieved at the coupled - cluster level . because of the local character of the correlation hole one can expand the correlation energy of the solid in terms of local increments @xcite .",
    "the idea thereby is to determine the required matrix elements by studying local excitations in finite clusters which are accessible to a full post - hf quantum - chemical treatment .",
    "we apply this idea to the zinc - blende and the wurtzite structures of the title materials .",
    "+ in the first part of this paper we want to report on hartree - fock calculations for sic , aln , gan and inn using pseudopotentials and optimized gaussian basis sets for the zinc - blende and wurtzite structure ( sec .",
    "ii ) . the method of increments , which is briefly described in sec .",
    "iiia , is extended to the wurtzite structure ; computational details are given in sec .",

    "conclusions follow in section v.",
    "the periodic hartree - fock method as implemented in the crystal92 program @xcite is used in our calculations .",
    "the problem of accurately calculating the coulomb and exchange contributions to the fock operator is addressed by taking very tight tolerances in the evaluation of these series , which lead to convergence of the total energy to about @xmath0 hartree . for the inert core electrons we use the scalar - relativistic energy - consistent pseudopotentials of bergner _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "two exceptions are made : 3-valence - electron pseudopotentials for the post-@xmath1 elements gallium and indium have been found to underestimate the closed - shell repulsion of the underlying @xmath1 shell on valence electrons of neighbouring atoms@xcite ; we therefore performed the scf calculations for ga and in compounds with 13-valence electron pseudopotentials@xcite , explicitly treating the highest occupied @xmath1 shell .",
    "+ for all of these pseudopotentials corresponding atomic basis sets have been optimized @xcite .",
    "these are used in the hartree - fock calculations for the free atoms , which are performed with the program package molpro94 @xcite . for the solid we generated contracted [ @xmath2 gaussian valence basis sets ( ga and in : [",
    "@xmath3 ) as follows : starting from the energy - optimized atomic basis sets just mentioned , the inner functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 symmetry are contracted using atomic ground - state orbital coefficients ; the outermost @xmath4 and @xmath5 functions are left uncontracted .",
    "we re - optimized the exponents of these functions , together with an additional @xmath1 polarization function , for the solid .",
    "thereby , we must pay attention to the fact , that too diffuse exponents cause numerical problems in crystal .",
    "but the most diffuse exponents of the atom , which are necessary for a correct description of the free atom , have little effect in the solid , since due to close - packing basis functions of the neighbouring atoms take over their role .",
    "the crystal - optimized basis sets are listed in table [ basis ] .",
    "+ in order to check the quality of the basis sets we calculated the ground - state energy of the zinc - blende structure with larger [ @xmath6 and [ @xmath7 basis sets for si / c / al / n and ga / in , respectively .",
    "these basis sets are generated from the latter ones by de - contracting the outermost primitive gaussian of the inner @xmath4 and @xmath5 functions , thus leaving two outer gaussians uncontracted .",
    "the @xmath1 functions are kept unchanged .",
    "there are very small changes in the cohesive energy due to this enlargement of the basis .",
    "the maximum deviation occurs for inn with 0.005 a.u .. an additional test of the basis set chosen is the comparison with the hartree - fock values by pandey _ et al._@xcite who calculated the ground state of gan in the wurtzite structure with an all - electron basis of comparable quality : the deviation from our values is less than 0.4% for the lattice constant .",
    "+ the geometry optimization is performed as follows : for the zinc - blende structure there is only one free parameter , the cubic lattice constant @xmath8 .",
    "this is varied in steps of 1% of the experimental value .",
    "six points are calculated and a quadratic fit is applied to determine the position of the minimum and the curvature .",
    "+ the wurtzite structure has three free geometry parameters . in the first place , the two lattice constants @xmath9 ( in the hexagonal plane ) and @xmath10 ( perpendicular to the hexagonal plane ) , or one lattice constant and the ratio @xmath11 which in the ideal case ( bond lengths as in the zinc - blende structure ) is @xmath12 , have to be optimized .",
    "the third parameter is the cell - internal dimensionless constant @xmath13 , which denotes the position of the second atom along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the ideal value would be @xmath15 ; a deviation from it corresponds to a change in the bond angle away from the ideal tetrahedral one .",
    "we optimize all these parameters in the following way : first we vary the volume of the unit cell in steps of 1% and determine @xmath16 , then , for fixed @xmath16 , we vary the ratio @xmath11 and last , for fixed @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the cell - internal @xmath13 . with the optimized @xmath13",
    ", we checked its influence on @xmath11 and @xmath18 , which in general is very small .",
    "here we only want to sketch the basic ideas and some important formulae of the method of increments .",
    "a formal derivation and more details of the method for an infinite periodic system can be found in ref .. the method relies on localized bond orbitals generated in a scf reference calculation .",
    "one - bond correlation - energy increments @xmath19 are obtained by correlating each of the localized orbitals separately while keeping the other ones inactive . in the present work we are using the coupled - cluster approach with single and double substitutions ( ccsd ) .",
    "this yields a first approximation of the correlation energy @xmath20 which corresponds to the correlation energy of independent bonds .",
    "+ in the next step we include the correlations of pairs of bonds .",
    "only the non - additive part @xmath21 of the two - bond correlation energy @xmath22 is needed .",
    "@xmath23 higher order increments are defined analogously .",
    "for the three - bond increment , for example , one has @xmath24 the correlation energy of the solid is finally obtained by adding up all the increments with appropriate weight factors : @xmath25 it is obvious that by calculating higher and higher increments the exact correlation energy within ccsd is determined .",
    "however , the procedure described above is only useful if the incremental expansion is well convergent , i.e. if increments up to , say , three - bond increments are sufficient , and if increments rapidly decrease with increasing distance between localized orbitals .",
    "these conditions were shown to be well met in the case of elementary semiconductors @xcite and cubic iii - v semiconductors @xcite .",
    "we apply the procedure described above to calculate the correlation energies per unit cell ( u.c . ) for sic and the iii - v compounds aln , gan and inn , with the zinc - blende ( 2 atoms / u.c . ) and wurtzite ( 4 atoms / u.c . ) structures .",
    "we evaluate the symmetry - unique increments in eq .",
    "( 4 ) and multiply them by appropriate weight factors which are determined by the crystalline symmetry of the unit cell .",
    "for the zinc - blende structure all four bonds of the unit cell are equivalent . in the wurtzite structure",
    "the two vertical bonds along the c - direction ( @xmath26 in fig.[structure]b ) differ from the six bonds of the buckling plane ( @xmath27 in fig.[structure]b ) ; these bonds will be called planar bonds in the following . for a direct comparison of the two structures we reduce the correlation energy per unit cell of the wurtzite structure by a factor 2",
    "the weight factors of all increments considered for both structures are listed in table [ inc ] .",
    "+ since ( dynamical ) correlations are a local effect , the increments should be fairly local entities at least for semiconductors and insulators .",
    "we use this property to calculate the correlation energy increments in finite clusters .",
    "we select the clusters as fragments of the zinc - blende and wurtzite structures so that we can calculate all two - bond increments up to third - nearest neighbours and all nearest - neighbour three - bond increments .",
    "the clusters used for the zinc - blende structure are shown in fig.[zb ] , those for the wurtzite structure in fig.[wurt ] . in the zinc - blende structure",
    "all bond lengths and bond angles ( tetrahedral , @xmath28=109.4712@xmath29 ) are the same .",
    "as mentioned before , in the wurtzite structure the vertical and planar bond lengths are different , and so are the planar - vertical ( @xmath30 in fig.[structure]b ) and planar - planar ( @xmath31 in fig.[structure]b ) bond angles , too .",
    "the numerical values for the bond lengths and bond angles are taken from the hartree - fock calculations for the periodic solid ; for the zinc - blende structure these are @xmath32=1.8963 , @xmath33=1.8941 , @xmath34=1.9579and @xmath35=2.1594 , for the wurtzite structure we have @xmath36=1.9089 , @xmath37=1.8919 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; @xmath40=1.8983 , @xmath41=1.8934 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ; @xmath44=1.9619 , @xmath45=1.9547 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ; @xmath48=2.1677 , @xmath49=2.1608 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",

    "in addition , an extended basis set ( basis b ) has been generated by uncontracting the @xmath4 and @xmath5 functions of basis a and by replacing the single @xmath1 function by a @xmath64 polarization set@xcite .",

    "they rapidly decrease with increasing distance of the bonds involved .",
    "the nearest - neighbour two - bond increments are about eight times larger than the weighted sum of all third - nearest ones .",
    "after the latter , we truncate the expansion of the correlation energy because with the fourth - nearest neighbours contribution we reach the van der waals limit of the correlation energy ( decay @xmath66 ) . the error due to the truncation can be estimated to 0.5% of the correlation energy .",
    "the convergence with respect to the number of bonds simultaneously correlated in the incremental expansion is also satisfactory . for sic ,",
    "the one - bond increment contributes with 38% of the correlation energy , the two - bond increments are very important ( 67% ) but lead to an overestimation of the correlation energy , which is effectively reduced by the three - bond increments ( 5% ) .",
    "the most important four - bond increments contribute only with 0.5% to the incremental expansion , and are neglected therefore .",
    "thus , the overall error due to truncation of the incremental expansion is less than 1% of the correlation energy .",
    "the shortcomings of one- and many - particle basis sets in the determination of individual increments cause the largest part of the error of the correlation energy .",

    "the results are listed in the first column of table [ results ] . in all cases ,",
    "electron correlation yields the same energetic order of states as hartree - fock , but energy differences are enlarged by up to 40% for sic and for none of the substances are negligible . + for sic we found that the zinc - blende structure is slightly more stable than the wurtzite one , but the energy difference is so small , that it might be taken as an indication of the occurring polytypism .",

    "the large deviation between our result and the relaxed lda result can be understood from a comparison of the corresponding volumes of the unit cell . whereas in the work of kckell _",
    "the zinc - blende volume was found to be smaller by about 0.18 @xmath69 than the wurtzite one , in our calculations the volumes are essentially the same .",
    "+ for all iii - v nitrides the calculations yield a stable wurtzite structure as experimentally observed .",
    "the energy differences are significantly larger than the one for sic , which clearly indicates that no polytypism exists for the iii - v nitrides .",

    "et al._@xcite , our energy differences are larger again , by about a factor of two , but the trends reproduced are the same .",
    "a possible explanation is the following : the lda gets the long - range interaction right , because the latter can be well described in a mean - field approach , and thus yields the right structure .",
    "but the short - range correlations , which can only be described with a many - body theory , have a substantial influence on the total energy and on the energy differences as well .      in order to find the minimum of the total energy we calculated the optimized hartree - fock geometries for both the zinc - blende and wurtzite structures .",

    "+ for gan the hartree - fock calculation overestimates the lattice constants by @xmath701.3% , although the @xmath11-ratio agrees well with experiment .",
    "this fact can partly be explained with the missing electron correlation ( cf .  the discussion below ) .",
    "the @xmath13-parameter is smaller than that of aln but still larger than the ideal one , which indicates that the wurtzite structure of gan is not as stable as that of aln . + for inn all lattice parameters are close to experiment .",

    ", we checked this influence for sic only where we calculated the cubic lattice constant at the correlated level with basis a. virtually no change to the hartree - fock value is seen ( an increase @xmath71 0.1% ) .",
    "this can be understood by the opposing effect of inter- and intra - atomic correlations .",
    "the inter - atomic correlation that dominates for the lighter elements such as c and n increases the lattice constant , while intra - atomic correlations that become more important for heavier elements decrease it .",
    "thus the net effect of correlation cancels for sic and probably , to a great part , for aln , too .",
    "gan is an exception : there the core - valence correlation yields an important contribution to the reduction of the lattice constant , because the fully occupied 3@xmath1 shell of ga is easily polarizable .",
