    "it is apparent that the papers @xcite contain the complete story of @xmath11 .",
    "as far as we know , the first connections between approximately convex functions and the geometry of infinite dimensional banach spaces appear in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that lipschitz @xmath2-convex functions are approximable on bounded sets of b - convex spaces , with the distance to the approximating convex function depending only on @xmath2 .",
    "( recall that b - convexity means ` having non - trivial type @xmath12 ' . ) that paper contains some counterexamples based on the fact that @xmath13 is the banach envelope of the spaces @xmath14 for all @xmath15 . in @xcite",

    "a @xmath0-space is a homological property of banach spaces which is closely related to the behaviour of quasi - linear maps .",
    "it suffices to recall here that the spaces @xmath14 and @xmath16 are @xmath0-spaces if and only if @xmath17 .    with this background ,",
    "let us explain the contents and the organization of the paper .",
    "the first section is preliminary : we use the fact that @xmath13 is not a @xmath0-space to obtain explicit examples of ` bad ' approximately convex functions on infinite dimensional simplexes ( the examples in @xcite are not explicit . )",
    "this leads to the question of whether @xmath0-spaces admit ` bad ' @xmath2-convex functions on their unit balls .",
    "the ( affirmative ) answer comes in section 2 , where we exhibit a non - trivial approximately convex function on the infinite dimensional cube ( the unit ball of @xmath18 ) .",
    "this solves the main problem raised in @xcite .",
    "having seen that the local stability of convexity does not hold in @xmath0-spaces , we prove in section 4 that the local stability of affinity is equivalent to being a @xmath0-space : precisely , a banach space @xmath19 is a @xmath0-space if and only if for every @xmath2-affine function @xmath20 defined on its unit ball @xmath21 there exists a true affine @xmath22 such that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant depending only on @xmath19 . in section",
    "4 we prove a similar result for jensen s functional equation @xmath25 we conclude sections 3 and 4 by showing that there is a universal constant @xmath26 such that if @xmath20 is an @xmath2-affine function defined on the @xmath10-dimensional ( euclidean ) ball @xmath5 then there exists an affine function @xmath7 with @xmath27 .",
    "a similar result is proved for @xmath10-cubes .",
    "this solves a problem posed by laczkovich in @xcite .",
    "section 5 deals with the question of the uniform approximation . under rather mild assumptions on the convex set @xmath5",
    "we show that if every @xmath2-affine ( respectively , @xmath2-jensen ) @xmath1 is approximable by an affine ( respectively , jensen ) function @xmath28 , then this can be done with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant depending only on @xmath5 .    finally , sections 6 and 7 deal with banach envelopes . in some sense ,",
    "the banach envelope @xmath31 is the nearest banach space to a given quasi - banach space @xmath19 . here",
    ", we regard @xmath19 as a topological vector space whose topology is ` approximately convex ' while that of @xmath31 is truly convex .",
    "our contribution complements previous results by kalton .",
    "precisely , we show that @xmath32 is not isometric to the banach envelope of a non - locally convex space ( with separating dual ) although there are non - locally convex spaces @xmath19 whose banach envelopes are arbitrarily close ( in the banach - mazur distance ) to @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath33 be ( real ) banach spaces .",
    "a map @xmath34 is said to be quasi - linear if :    * it is homogeneous : @xmath35 for all @xmath36 and @xmath37 . *",
    "it is quasi - additive : @xmath38 for some constant @xmath39 independent on @xmath40 .",
    "the least possible constant in the above inequality is denoted @xmath41 and referred to as the quasi - additivity constant of the map @xmath20 . when @xmath20 is homogeneous we also speak of @xmath41 as the quasi - linearity constant of @xmath20 .",
    "although the original notion of a @xmath0-space refers to the possibility of lifting operators ( see @xcite for background ) , it will be convenient for our purposes to give the following definition .    _",
    "a banach space is a @xmath0-space if for every quasi - linear map @xmath42 there is a linear ( although not necessarily continuous ! ) functional @xmath43 such that @xmath44 for some @xmath30 and all @xmath36 . _    thus @xmath0-spaces are closely related to the stability of linear functionals .",
    "but that stability is `` asymptotic '' rather than `` epsilonic '' .",
    "it will be convenient to introduce the following asymptotic distance for functions acting between banach spaces : @xmath45 where the infimum of the empty set is treated as infinity . in this way ,",
    "a @xmath0-space is a banach space in which every quasi - linear functional @xmath20 is at finite distance from some linear functional @xmath46 .",
    "in fact @xmath46 can be chosen in such a way that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a constant depending only on @xmath19 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 ) .",
    "there are two main types of @xmath0-spaces : b - convex spaces @xcite and @xmath49-spaces @xcite .",
    "thus , for instance , the classical spaces @xmath14 and @xmath16 are @xmath0-spaces for all @xmath50 as well as @xmath32 and all @xmath51 spaces .    on the other hand , @xmath13 ( and also every infinite dimensional @xmath52-space ) is not a @xmath0-space .",
    "this was proved by kalton @xcite , ribe @xcite and roberts @xcite .",
    "in fact kalton @xcite and ribe @xcite give ( more or less ) explicit examples of quasi - linear maps @xmath53 with @xmath54 for all linear maps @xmath55 .",
    "ribe s map is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and assuming @xmath58 .",
    "it is quasi - linear with constant 2 .",
    "kalton s map is defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the decreasing arrangement of @xmath61 and then extended to the finitely supported sequences of @xmath13 by @xmath62 it should be noted that the above formul  have sense only for finitely supported sequences .",
    "nevertheless , quasi - linear maps can be extended from dense subspaces to the whole space ( preserving quasi - linearity ) .",
    "one of the basic observations in @xcite was that the restriction of a quasi - linear map to a bounded set of a banach space is an approximately convex function which is uniformly close to a convex function if and only if the starting quasi - linear map is asymptotically close to a linear map .",
    "since in this paper we shall deal with convexity , affinity and jensen functional equation , let us state a slightly stronger result for midconvex functions .",
    "recall that a midconvex function is one satisfying the inequality @xmath63    [ midconvex ] let @xmath42 be a quasi - linear function .",
    "suppose there is a midconvex function @xmath64 such that @xmath65 .",
    "then there is a linear map @xmath43 such that @xmath66 .",
    "this follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proof of theorem 2 ) ( in which the result was proved for convex @xmath28 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 8.8 ) ( asserting that the midconvex function @xmath28 is actually convex ) .    in this way , every ( non - trivial ) quasi - linear map produces a `` bad '' approximately convex function on the ball of the corresponding banach space . even if nobody knows the values of ribe s function on points @xmath61 for which the series @xmath67 diverges , we can use it to produce an explicit counterexample on the `` infinite - dimensional simplex '' @xmath68 indeed , if @xmath69 denotes the subset of all finitely supported sequences in @xmath70 , then @xmath69 is convex and @xmath71 acts as an ideal : if @xmath72 and @xmath73 then every non - trivial convex combination @xmath74 belongs to @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the function @xmath76 is @xmath77-convex on @xmath70 , but @xmath78 for any convex @xmath79 .",
    "kalton s function leads to another explicit counterexample taking @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "this yields explicit counterexamples for the hyers - ulam stability of convexity in infinite dimensions :    [ infinite ] every infinite dimensional banach space contains a compact convex set @xmath84 and an approximately convex map @xmath85 such that @xmath86 for every convex @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath87 be a ( normalized ) basic sequence in @xmath19 .",
    "the map @xmath88 sending @xmath89 into @xmath90 defines an one - to - one affine map between @xmath70 and a certain compact convex set @xmath84 .",
    "now , if @xmath20 is the function given in ( [ ribe ] ) , then @xmath91 is a non - approximable 1-convex function on @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an arbitrary function defined on a convex set .",
    "the function @xmath92 represents the greatest convex minorant of @xmath20 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath20 is uniformly close to some convex function on @xmath5 if and only if ( @xmath93 takes only finite values and ) @xmath94 .",
    "actually the distance from @xmath20 to the convex functions is @xmath95 and it is attained at @xmath96 .",
    "this will be used without further mention .",
    "all non - trivial @xmath2-convex functions presented so far depend on the fact that @xmath13 is not a @xmath0-space .",
    "so , at this moment the question is if there are bad @xmath2-convex functions on the ball of a @xmath0-space . to tackle",
    "this question one needs a completely different type of approximately convex function : since we will prove in section [ sec : af ] that the notion of affinity is stable on the ball of a @xmath0-space , one idea is to work with a function which is approximately convex , but not approximately concave .",
    "such an example is supplied by cholewa and kominek @xcite ( see also @xcite ) as follows : let @xmath97 be the positive cone of the space of all finitely supported sequences ; for @xmath98 set @xmath99 and then @xmath100 this function is @xmath101-convex on @xmath97 ( @xcite ) . since @xmath102 but @xmath103 the function @xmath104 is not uniformly close to any convex function on @xmath105 . since every infinite dimensional space ( no topology is assumed )",
    "contains a subset affinely isomorphic to @xmath105 we obtain a non - trivial approximately convex function defined on `` some part '' of it .",
    "it remains to establish the connection with the normed structure of the space . to this end , assume that @xmath19 is an ordered banach space @xcite and let @xmath106 be its positive cone .",
    "the continuous analogue of the cholewa - kominek function is @xmath107    [ -logx ] let @xmath19 be an ordered banach space",
    ". then @xmath108 is @xmath77-convex on @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath61 and @xmath110 are positive , then @xmath111 .",
    "thus , for @xmath112 , one has @xmath113 and so @xmath114 ; also @xmath115 .",
    "therefore @xmath116 since @xmath117 for all @xmath118 ( the minimum value is attained at @xmath119 ) the function @xmath120 is 1-convex on @xmath121    r7.7 cm     [ not ] with the above notations , if @xmath122 contains a weakly null normalized sequence then @xmath108 can not be uniformly approximated by any convex function on @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 be a weakly null sequence in @xmath122 with @xmath125 .",
    "then there exists a sequence @xmath126 of convex combinations of the @xmath127 s such that @xmath128 and so @xmath129 .",
    "however , any convex function approximating @xmath108 should be bounded on convex combinations of the @xmath127 since @xmath130 for all @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we have defined a `` bad '' approximately convex function on the unit ball of non - schur cones .",
    "observe that in @xmath13 the preceding function becomes approximately convex .",
    "note , however , that composing with the inclusion of @xmath13 into @xmath32 one obtains another explicit `` bad '' 1-convex function on the infinite dimensional simplex :    @xmath131    to obtain the function defined on the whole unit ball requires some extra work using additional properties of the spaces .",
    "there exist nontrivial approximately convex functions defined on the ( closed ) unit ball of either @xmath18 or @xmath132 ( the space of convergent sequences ) .",
    "let @xmath19 denote one of the spaces @xmath18 or @xmath133 .",
    "the key point is that the unit ball of @xmath19 is affine - isomorphic to its positive part : consider the map @xmath134 given by @xmath135 .",
    "thus , it suffices to get a `` bad '' approximately convex function on the positive part of the unit ball .",
    "first of all , note that lemma [ not ] asserts that @xmath136 is a `` bad '' @xmath77-convex map on @xmath137 .",
    "it remains to avoid the singularity at the origin .",
    "consider the `` involution '' of @xmath138 given by @xmath139 and let us modify the cholewa - kominek function to make @xmath77 the singular point instead of @xmath140 .",
    "this yields the amended function @xmath141 now , for each @xmath142 , we set the 1-convex functions @xmath143 defined on the whole @xmath144 ; they are increasingly far from convex functions as @xmath145 approaches @xmath77 .",
    "it remains to past these pieces together .",
    "let @xmath146 be the projection of @xmath19 onto its first @xmath10-coordinates , and let @xmath147 be a sequence converging to 1 .",
    "we define the functions @xmath148 which are non - negative and 1-convex on the positive part of the unit ball of @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath149 for all @xmath150 , then @xmath151 for all @xmath150 .",
    "it follows that for every finitely supported @xmath152 the sequence @xmath153 is bounded .",
    "hence we can define a new @xmath77-convex function on the finitely supported sequences of @xmath138 by taking @xmath154 ( the pointwise supremum of @xmath2-convex functions is @xmath2-convex whenever it makes sense . ) finally , we extend @xmath155 to all of @xmath138 by putting @xmath156 for @xmath157 . using the fact that the complement of @xmath158 in @xmath138 acts as an ideal ( with respect to convex combinations ) and that @xmath155 is non negative on @xmath159 it is easily verified that the resulting map @xmath155 is @xmath77-convex on the whole of @xmath138 .    the construction concludes showing that @xmath155 is at infinite distance from any convex function on @xmath138 . actually , the ensuing argument shows that @xmath160 for all convex @xmath161 .    to see this , fix @xmath162 and let @xmath163 .",
    "consider the points @xmath164 .",
    "we see that @xmath165 . however , @xmath166 and so @xmath167 which already implies that @xmath155 can not be approximated by any convex function defined on a convex set containing @xmath168 .",
    "we have thus solved the main problem in @xcite showing that non - trivial @xmath2-convex functions can occur in the unit ball of @xmath0-spaces .    as for the other type of @xmath0-spaces , the b - convex ones , it remains to know :    [ bconvex ] _ do b - convex spaces admit bad @xmath2-convex functions on their unit balls ? _",
    "we already know that the stability of convexity does not hold on ( the unit ball of ) arbitrary @xmath0-spaces .",
    "however , under some homogeneity conditions , @xmath2-convex functions defined on @xmath0-spaces can be approximated by convex ones ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 2 and 4 ) ) .",
    "thus one may wonder which other classes of functions could provide a characterization of @xmath0-spaces .",
    "having in mind the behaviour of quasi - linear functions on balls , it is not too surprising that @xmath2-affinity works .",
    "recall that a mapping @xmath1 ( here @xmath5 is a convex subset of a linear space ) is said to be @xmath2-affine if it satisfies @xmath169 for all @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "that is , an @xmath2-affine map is one which , in addition to being @xmath2-convex , is also `` @xmath2-concave '' . before going further ,",
    "let us prove the following simple consequence of hahn - banach separation theorem .",

    "it is clear that @xmath188 .",
    "it follows that @xmath179 is the graph of certain affine function @xmath189 separating @xmath175 from @xmath176 : @xmath190 hence @xmath191 and so @xmath192 .    in this way we obtain an alternate proof of the fact that approximately affine functions are uniformly approximable by affine functions on finite dimensional convex sets (",
    "* theorem  2 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that the restriction of a quasi - linear map to a bounded set is approximately affine , and so is ribe s original function on @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we obtain that the `` affine '' version of proposition  [ infinite ] is also true : if @xmath19 is an infinite dimensional banach space , there is an approximately affine function defined on a compact subset of @xmath19 which can not be approximated by any affine function .",
