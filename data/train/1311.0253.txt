    "as a branch of non - equilibrium statistical physics , the study of transport phenomena seeks information on _ microscopic processes _ through measurement of _ macroscopic physical quantities _ associated with transport , such as a diffusion coefficient , generally through mean square displacements .",
    "an emblematic diffusion example is still the case of particles motion in a  granular \" medium .",
    "this problem of so - called brownian motion was explained by einstein @xcite .",
    "this is a typical case of normal statistics system and seems to be obeyed by an enormous number of examples , where displacements have arbitrary values but where very precise average values characterize the system .",
    "examples can be found in all kinds of scientific fields , from economics and finances , biology and chemistry to astronomy and physics .",
    "the interpretation of these stochastic processes is done using well known tools from statistics .",
    "these are basically grounded in two main laws : i ) the law of large numbers , stating that as you increase the number of trials the resulting averages and moments tend to the theoretical ones and ii ) the central limit theorem ( clt ) , which states that the accumulated action of a large number , @xmath0 , of equivalent ( same probability distribution , with expected value @xmath1 and variance @xmath2 ) , independent individual random processes results in a gaussian distribution with expected value and variance fully determined by those ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) of the generating distribution , no matter the _ shape _ of this generating distribution .",
    "this insensitivity to the details of the microscopic process explains why many physical , chemical , social , financial and so on phenomena lend themselves to this interpretation , so that it is commonly called ",
    "these normal laws applied to diffusion phenomena lead to a mean square displacement varying linearly with time , i.e. after a large number of random kicks in all directions , a particle of coffee in a cup of milk ( or molecules of oxygen in the air , or a drunkard with no purpose ) will have covered a distance proportional to the square root of the time spent : @xmath3 the first transport phenomenon breaking this law that comes to mind is the ballistic movement where a particle , not suffering any collision ( and thus actually non diffusive ) , travels in a straight line with a speed @xmath4 , covering during a time @xmath5 the distance @xmath6    i.e.    @xmath7    diffusion is actually ballistic as long as the observation time is shorter than the mean time between collisions .",
    "other transport phenomena break the normal laws more radically and one of the most recently observed is the object of this paper : the superdiffusion of light in resonant atomic vapours . the diffusion problem we are discussing here is related to the _ dynamical _ behavior of the system .",
    "this dynamical problem has a  long tail \" signature , a characteristic it shares with another class of scale - free systems , the web and equivalent systems based on connectivity .",
    "the peculiar structure or topology of those systems leads to statistical distributions following power laws , resulting in unexpected behaviors such as the dominant role of a very few elements of the system @xcite .",
    "let us therefore distinguish these categories from the dynamical behavior of systems being discussed here : a dynamical system may , for example , _ evolve _ from normal to sub- or super - diffusive .",
    "focussing on the particular case of light diffusion , we will introduce here the fascinating concept of lvy flights , where the average response may become meaningless , because the concepts of mean value or variance are no longer well - defined .",
    "in order to better appreciate how abnormal superdiffusion is , let us here summarize the main results of normal ( gaussian ) statistics : let @xmath8 be a set of identically distributed , independent variables @xmath9 , with probability density @xmath10 , expected value @xmath11 and variance @xmath12 . according to the law of large numbers , a random sampling of the distribution @xmath10 will yield a sample sum    @xmath13    a mean value    @xmath14    and a variance    @xmath15    a very interesting result of this statistical treatment of random events is that , regardless of the shape of most distributions @xmath10 , the distribution of sums , @xmath16 or of mean values , @xmath17 , of random samples , tend to be normal , with limiting gaussian distributions fully determined by the single event mean @xmath18 and the second moment @xmath19 , assuming they are finite .",
    "this is the deep , powerful statement of the clt .     of @xmath20 single events @xmath8 drawn from the distribution @xmath21 , 1@xmath226 ( dice rolls ) .",
    "the distributions ( b ) @xmath23 of @xmath24 samples of sums @xmath25 and ( c ) @xmath26 of @xmath24 samples of mean values @xmath27 tend to gaussian distributions as @xmath24 is increased , with mean and variance determined by expected value and variance of the parent distribution @xmath10 ( see text ) . for @xmath28 and : top , @xmath29 ; middle @xmath30 ; bottom @xmath31.,width=302 ]    , with @xmath32 , 0@xmath221.,width=302 ]    in figs .",
    "[ distributionsa ] and [ distributionsb ] are shown two examples of non - gaussian distributions of variables whose sums and averages tend to be normally distributed .",
    "the first one ( figure [ distributionsa ] ) , an example of a discrete uniform distribution , is the distribution of probability of rolling any value of a fair 6-sided die in a single roll .",
    "the second one ( figure [ distributionsb ] ) is an example of an asymmetric continuous distribution . in both examples , the sum and the mean value of @xmath0 draws",
    "are given by equations ( [ sum ] ) and ( [ mean ] ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath26 are the observed distributions of @xmath24 samples of @xmath25 and @xmath27 , respectively . in figure ( [ distributionsa ] ) and ( [ distributionsb ] )",

    "this seemingly systematic convergence explains why so many real phenomena resulting from the action of many tiny random events with very diverse distributions can eventually be fitted by a gaussian distribution .",

    "let us now generalize these findings by focussing on probability distributions whose _ asymptotic decay _ can be approximated by a power - law :    @xmath45    with @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 , the first and second moments of the distribution , @xmath48 and @xmath19 , are finite and the distribution obeys the clt .",
    "this is what we observed for @xmath49 in the example given in figure [ normaldiff ] .",
    "however , if the distribution s asymptotic decay is _ slower _ than @xmath50 , i.e. if @xmath51 , then @xmath19 is _ no longer finite _ and the clt does not apply anymore . in the case @xmath52 , even the first moment @xmath48 diverges , meaning that these distributions do not exhibit a typical behavior , because the probability of very large values of @xmath8 ( far wings of the probability distribution ) is much - larger - than - normal .",
    "their repeated application ( large number @xmath0 of events @xmath9 ) , characterized by @xmath25 defined in equation ( [ sum ] ) , does not follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "these distributions obey , however , a generalised central limit theorem , according to which , if the distribution s asymptotic behavior follows equation ( [ asympt ] ) with @xmath53 , then the normalized probability densities of its sum @xmath25 and , consequently , of its mean value @xmath27 , follow a stable lvy law .    , for @xmath54 .",

    "the distributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( not shown ) _ do not _ converge to a gaussian shape and the 2d isotropic random walk resulting from drawing the step lengths from @xmath59 does not look diffusive .",
    "instead , we can observe in figure [ superdiff](b ) long jumps characteristic of a lvy flight behavior . in this case , the mean - square displacement @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "systems expanding as @xmath62 under the action of stochastic processes are said to exhibit normal diffusion if @xmath63 and superdiffusion ( subdiffusion ) if @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "brownian motion is a paradigm of normal diffusion and an overwhelming majority of stochastic phenomena in all fields exhibits this behavior .",
    "much less numerous but being gradually uncovered are examples of systems showing abnormal diffusion .",
    "they are found in very diverse systems @xcite such as physiology @xcite , ecology @xcite , human mobility and virus propagation @xcite , finance and economy @xcite , physics @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , etc .",
    "while dynamical effects of superdiffusion can be observed and characterized in those systems , the fundamental mechanisms leading to lvy flights are in general not elucidated and remain the subject of intense study .",
    "for instance , broad distributions may appear as a consequence of the fundamental non linear dynamics of the system @xcite . in ecology ,",
    "lvy flights seem to be associated to ( evolutionary ) optimization of search patterns in situations of scarcity ( food , mates ) , while brownian movements dominate in abundance contexts @xcite .",
    "as we will see later on , the physical origin of lvy flights of photons in resonant atomic vapours lies in the specific shapes of absorption and emission spectral distributions , which themselves arise from fundamental and kinetic properties of atoms .",
    "from now on , we will restrict ourselves to the description of the propagation of photons in material media , i.e. we restrict the discussion to particles of light .",
    "propagation of light in scattering media represents _ per se _ a unique and interesting system , because it is a very familiar and ubiquitous phenomenon , yet with huge practical interest , for example as our main source of knowledge about interstellar medium or in modern photonics applications .",
    "it has now gained an extra charm as a system likely to exhibit abnormal diffusion properties and , probably , the earliest recognized as such @xcite .",
    "light represents a versatile tool for studying transport phenomena and can be analysed in a variety of materials . in free space",
    ", a photon travels in a straight line with speed @xmath66 and thus covers a distance @xmath67 during a time interval @xmath5 , which is a ballistic movement according to equation ( [ ballistic ] ) . in a ( dilute )",
    "material medium , the photons are scattered by material constituents and a transition occurs from ballistic to diffusive behavior as the constituents density increases .",
    "the mean free path is the mean distance traveled by the photons between two scattering events , @xmath68 ( in photon scattering , dominant delays are usually the collisions times , much larger than the propagation time between two scattering events , as opposed to scattering of material particles , where the dominant time is the propagation one ) . if the typical dimensions of the medium are smaller than @xmath69 , the transport is still essentially ballistic , otherwise it is diffusive . in a _",
    "normal _ diffusive medium , the propagation of photons can be described as a random walk with a gaussian distribution @xmath70 of the step length @xmath71 between two scatterers .",
    "this distribution is characterized by its mean value @xmath72 and its second moment @xmath73 .",
    "the mean free path @xmath74 is inversely proportional to the density of scatterers , @xmath75 , and to the scattering cross section @xmath76 , @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "so far very few systems involving light propagation have been reported to exhibit non - normal behavior .",
    "one of them is a random amplifying medium ( ram ) , constituted of amplifying fiber segments embedded in a passive scattering bulk @xcite .",
    "the intensity distribution at the sample exit results from multiple scattering of the photons by the passive bulk as well as from successive passages through fiber segments , in which the photons are amplified .",
    "therefore , the longer the segment , the stronger the amplification .",
    "the distribution of lengths of the fiber - segments is intentionally tailored so as to yield a lvy - like intensity distribution of the ram emission .",
    "a second system , called  lvy glass \" by its designers @xcite , is an engineered solid material where the density of scattering medium ( titanium dioxide nanoparticles ) is modulated by non - scattering spheres of diameter - distribution tailored to yield a lvy - like transmission spatial distribution .",
    "both of these experimental observations of lvy flights of photons @xcite are based on synthetic , engineered , _ spatial _ inhomegeneities . as we shall see in the following sections , in spatially _ homogeneous _ resonant atomic vapours , the distance a photon will travel between two scattering events",
    "depends not only on the scatterers density ( constant ) but also on the photon s frequency , so that the superdiffusive transport in these natural media originates in a _",
    "spectral _ inhomogeneity instead of a spatial one .",
    "radiation trapping is the name given to the phenomenon of resonant multi - scattering of light in atomic vapours .",
    "in such a process , incident photons are first absorbed by atoms in the gas medium because their frequency @xmath78 is close to that of an atomic transition , @xmath79 .",
    "the absorption of the photons is stronger at the center of the resonance , i.e. at @xmath80 , and , depending on the absorption spectral shape , decays more or less sharply on either side of the resonance ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the excited atoms eventually decay radiatively to the ground state and the emitted photon can be absorbed by another atom and so on .",
    "the absorption - emission process can occur at very high rates ( typically a few 100 mhz at room temperature ) in resonant atomic vapours , so that many of these processes may take place before the photons leave the cell , resulting in a time much longer than the mean atomic lifetime for the radiation to leave the vapour volume .",
    "radiation trapping is thus a mechanism that needs to be accounted for in the understanding of light propagation in stellar media @xcite , discharge lamps @xcite , gas- @xcite , liquid- @xcite as well as solid - state @xcite laser media , atomic line filters @xcite , trapped cold atoms @xcite , collision @xcite and coherent @xcite processes in atomic vapours , optical pumping of alkali - metal vapours @xcite .",
    "the concern with radiation imprisonment goes back at least as far as the 1920s , when compton @xcite and milne @xcite described theoretically the diffusion of resonant light in absorbing media .",
    "kenty @xcite interpreted experimental measurements by zemansky @xcite by taking into account the redistribution of frequency that takes place between absorption and reemission of light and ascertained that  abnormally long free paths are found to be of such importance as to enable resonance radiation to escape from a body of gas faster than has usually been supposed ... it is found that , for a gas container of infinite size , [ the diffusion coefficient , the average square free path , and the average free path ] are all infinite \" . in other words ,",
    "the diffusion model , based on the finiteness of the mean free path and second moment , does not rigorously apply to the problem of radiation trapping in resonant media .",
    "a few years later , holstein proposed a description through an integro - differential equation @xcite , which still constitutes the starting point of most formal descriptions of radiation trapping .",
    "let us introduce a number of physical parameters useful to describe a single emission - absorption process in an isotropic medium .",
    "let @xmath82 be the probability that a photon of frequency @xmath78 travel a distance @xmath71 without being absorbed ( transmission through @xmath71 ) .",
    "@xmath82 should have the limit values i ) @xmath83=1 and ii ) @xmath84=0 .",
    "let now @xmath85 be the probability , per unit length , that the photon be absorbed . to determine the relationship between @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we write the transmission of the photon through a depth @xmath71 plus a thin slice of width @xmath87 from ( @xmath71 ) ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) as the probability it arrives at @xmath71 times the probability it survives an additional distance @xmath87 :    @xmath88.\\ ] ]    as , by definition ,    @xmath89    then    @xmath90    this is the beer - lambert law @xcite , verifying assumptions i ) and ii ) above .    )",
    "filled with scattering medium , to determine fraction of particles incident at @xmath71 and transmitted through a thin slice of thickness @xmath87.,width=226 ]    the step - size distribution for a given frequency @xmath78 is @xmath91 .",
    "it means that of all the @xmath82 photons of frequency @xmath78 created at position @xmath92 that have arrived at position @xmath71 , @xmath93 will not survive an additional slice of depth @xmath87 , so that @xmath93 is the probability that these photons be absorbed between @xmath71 and @xmath94 .",
    "again , we write the transmission of the photons through a depth @xmath71 plus a thin slice of width @xmath87 from @xmath71 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) :    @xmath95    from eqs .",
    "[ partialt ] , [ trans ] and [ transabs ] , it follows that    @xmath96    this expression describes the single - path length distribution for photons of frequency @xmath78 propagating in a scattering medium characterized by the absorption spectrum @xmath85",
    ". we can determine the frequency - dependent mean free path @xmath97 for the photons in the scattering medium as being the mean value of the step - length distribution :    @xmath98    equation ( [ ellnu ] ) tells us that we can tune the mean free path of a monochromatic beam of photons at frequency @xmath78 simply by varying the absorption coefficient @xmath85 at this frequency .",
    "it is intuitively reasonable , as we may see in section [ specshapes ] , that @xmath85 is proportional to the atomic density , so that tuning of @xmath97 can be achieved through control of the atomic density .",
    "if the light incident on the scattering medium is not monochromatic but has instead a spectral distribution @xmath99 , the resulting path - length distribution corresponds to an averaging of @xmath91 over the ( emission ) spectrum @xmath99 :    @xmath100    the moments of this distribution are given by :    @xmath101    with @xmath102 the gamma function . in the special case of an incident laser beam , considered as monochromatic with frequency @xmath103 ,",
    "the photons spectral distribution is @xmath104 and the moments of the photons steps distribution , given by    @xmath105    are finite , as long as @xmath106 .",
    "particularly , for @xmath107 , we again find the mean free path of equation ( [ ellnu ] ) .",
    "similarly , in a vapour illuminated by any far - from - resonance spectral distribution ( @xmath108 ) , the absorption spectral distribution can be considered constant ( @xmath109 ) so that , once again , the moments are finite and the diffusion of light is normal , as it is in any non - resonant , homogeneous scattering medium such as fog or diluted milk :    @xmath110    on the other hand , the moments given by equation ( [ momentq ] ) can be shown to diverge for all the spectral lineshapes @xmath99 and @xmath85 usually associated with atomic transitions , specifically the doppler , lorentzian and voigt lineshapes .",
    "it means that the random walk in an atomic vapour for photons with any of these spectral distributions can not be characterized by a diffusion coefficient ( @xmath111 ) and , in some cases , not even by a mean free path @xmath112 , thus qualifying propagation of photons in a resonant vapour as anomalous diffusion .",
    "clearly therefore , the relationship between the emission and the absorption spectra is a key element of the diffusion regime of photons in the vapour .",
    "this relation may evolve in the medium , due to multi - scattering , and is regulated by processes of _ frequency redistribution_. in optically thin samples of cold atoms , neither atomic collisions nor residual atomic motion ( doppler broadening smaller than the natural line width ) are sufficient to significantly change the frequency of scattered photons before these escape the sample , so that no frequency redistribution takes place and the emission spectrum remains unchanged ( monochromatic laser beam for example ) , distinct from the atomic absorption spectrum .",
    "partial frequency redistribution ( pfr ) can be observed in stellar atmospheres and plasmas @xcite and in optically thick cold atomic samples , where the accumulation of tiny frequency redistribution due to residual motion of the atoms can become significant due either to a small mean free path ( resonant light ) or to large sample dimensions @xcite .",
    "in the complete frequency redistribution (cfr ) case , the frequencies of the scattered photons are fully decorrelated from the frequencies of the incident ones , for instance in situations where a high collision rate @xmath113 in the vapour destroys correlations between photon absorption and reemission events , i.e. where @xmath114 , with @xmath115 the lifetime of the excited state ( cfr in the atoms frame ) . in near - resonant thermal vapours ,",
    "the frequency of the emitted photon is statistically independent of the frequency of the absorbed one through averaging over the maxwellian velocity distribution ( due to the doppler effect ) .",
    "this ( multiple ) resonant scattering process very efficiently redistributes the photons frequencies , leading to cfr in the laboratory frame and to coincidence of the emission and absorption spectra ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the single - step length distribution ( equation ( [ single ] ) ) is thus :    @xmath117    and the mean free path of the photons in the vapour becomes    @xmath118",
    "as said above , the propagation of light in a scattering medium can be described as a random walk of photons within the medium .",
    "when the medium is near - resonant , the propagation of light is perturbed by the radiation trapping process : a photon incident in the medium ( a laser photon for example ) can be repeatedly absorbed and re - emitted in the medium .",
    "the multiple scattering process is now equivalent to a random walk in real space with frequency - dependent steps length , so that the spectral distribution of the photons , aided by the frequency redistribution process , is the key element determining their diffusion regime . in the case of complete frequency redistribution ,",
    "the frequency of the emitted photon is totally independent of the frequency of the absorbed one and is exclusively determined by the transition s spectral shape , be it gaussian , lorentzian or voigt . as aforementioned in section [ secprob ] and as we will show in the next section , the single - step length distribution @xmath70 decays asymptotically as @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) more slowly than @xmath121 .",
    "this slow decay characterizes broad ( long tail ) steps distributions , for which all moments @xmath122 with @xmath123 diverge .",
    "thus , as first signalised by kenty @xcite and holstein @xcite , the assumption of a mean free path for the photons is not fulfilled in resonant vapours and a diffusion - like description of radiation trapping is not adequate .",
    "the relation with long - tailed distributions , studied in the 1930s by lvy @xcite , and the theoretical labeling of incoherent radiation trapping as more a system exhibiting superdiffusive behavior , were made by pereira _",
    "_ @xcite and further studied @xcite in the early 2000 s .",
    "experimental confirmation followed a few years later @xcite .",
    "we may now focus on the spectral shapes more particularly associated with resonant light - atom interactions .",
    "they are given by :    @xmath124    with @xmath75 the atomic density , @xmath125 the resonant cross - section for atoms at rest and @xmath126 the normalized spectral shape , specific of the light - atom interaction regime .",
    "@xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the wavelength and @xmath129 the ratio of degeneracy factors .",
    "the homogeneous lorentz line shape characterizes systems with homogeneous broadening , due , for example , to spontaneous radiative decay or collisions , and is given by :    @xmath130    with @xmath131 , the photon s detuning in relation to the transition s frequency @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath132 has a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath133 and an asymptotical decay    @xmath134    i.e. with @xmath135 . as mentioned in section [ secprob ] , this characterizes a broad distribution with all moments diverging , i.e. not even a mean free path can be determined for the photon leaps .    the doppler line shape , reflecting the velocity distribution of doppler shifts , is given by :    @xmath136    with the reduced frequency @xmath137 .",

    "the  lvy \" behavior for the lorentz spectral shape ( @xmath149 ) is more dramatic than for the doppler one ( @xmath58 ) because the wings of the lorentzian distribution decrease more slowly than the doppler ones and therefore go farther : the probability that a photon be re - emitted with a very large detuning and therefore travel a very long distance before being absorbed , is higher in the lorentzian than in the doppler case .",
    "the voigt spectral distribution is a convolution of the two former ones :    @xmath150    with @xmath145 the voigt parameter .",
    "it characterizes the interaction with light of atoms individually submitted to homogeneous , lorentzian decaying processes ( spontaneous emission , collisions , .. ) and moving around according to gaussian maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution . as the wings of the doppler lineshape",
    "tend very rapidly to zero , the asymptotic decay of the overall voigt lineshape is the same as the lorentzian one and the steps distribution for a voigt profile is also a broad distribution with @xmath151 .    in figure [ figglv](b )",
    "are shown the lorentzian , doppler and voigt spectral distributions for a two - level atoms system of natural width @xmath146 ( excited state lifetime @xmath152 ) and doppler width @xmath147 .",
    "for example , this doppler broadening would be the amount suffered by a vapour of rubidium atoms at a temperature of approximately 1.5 k @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath145 parameter of the voigt distribution is thus of the order of 0.14 .",
    "the @xmath145 parameter basically compares the natural and the doppler line widths , @xmath146 and @xmath153 , respectively ( equation ( [ voigta ] ) ) . in what is called the doppler regime ,",
    "the doppler broadening of the lineshape is much larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the atomic transition and the lineshape tends to the doppler one ( small @xmath145 ) . as the @xmath145 parameter increases , the doppler broadening of the lineshape decreases in relation to the natural linewidth and the lineshape ultimately tends to the lorentz one ( cold atoms , for example ) .",
    "the configuration depicted in figure [ figglv](b ) corresponds to an intermediate case . as @xmath145 increases from @xmath154 to @xmath155 , the steps length distribution evolves from doppler- to lorentz - like , as can be seen in figure [ jumpsize ] .",

    "in cold atoms samples , the spectral lineshape is lorentzian with natural linewidth ( doppler broadening @xmath159 ) , but the scattering of photons is fundamentally elastic and frequency redistribution is insignificant , so that the hypothesis of lvy flights of photons in such a medium does not apply to a first approximation @xcite . up to now , the only atomic system in which photons lvy flights have been directly measured ( single - step length distribution with @xmath160 ) is a warm thermal vapour of rubidium atoms illuminated with a resonant laser @xcite .",
    "the experimental set - up is shown schematically in figure [ setup ] .",
    "photons with a spectral distribution @xmath161 are collimated and directed to a transparent cell containing an homogeneous atomic vapour of atoms .",
    "photons scattered by the atoms and escaping the cell through a given solid angle are detected by a ccd camera , which forms images of the spatial profile of the fluorescence in the cell .",
    "analysis of these images enables inference of the distribution of distances travelled by the incident photons in the scattering vapour .",
    "one major difficulty in this system , as in any multiple - scattering medium , is to infer the _ single - step _ distribution from the observed result of multiple scattering , because multiple scattering erases the information of the photon s initial position .",
    "let us detail a little the experimental aspects of this achievement as an illustration of the challenges faced when looking for signatures of microscopic processes in multiple scattering phenomena .",
    "obviously , the higher the atomic density , the smaller the spatial scale allowing observation of the asymptotic slope ( -@xmath162 ) ( see figure [ jumpsize ] ) .",
    "it may then seem tempting to work with a very high atomic density , but this would increase the mean number of scattering events for the photons before they leave the cell and are detected , blurring the single - step contribution .",
    "the adopted compromise consists in slightly increasing the atomic density , so as to guarantee a reasonable rate of scattering events on a reasonable scale and to correct for the potentially perturbative multiple - scattering effects @xcite .",
    "the order of magnitude of the resonant cross - section for alkali atoms is a few @xmath163 m@xmath164 @xcite .",
    "their natural linewidth is @xmath165 s@xmath166 . in a warm vapour",
    "( @xmath139 between 300 and 350 k ) , the doppler broadening of the atomic spectral response is @xmath167 s@xmath166 , i.e. the @xmath145 parameter ( equation ( [ voigta ] ) ) falls in the range of @xmath168 to @xmath169 . in this case , the asymptotic regime would be reached for optical densities above @xmath170 ( see figure [ jumpsize ] ) , i.e. in the required conditions of relatively low density ( a few @xmath171 atoms m@xmath172 ) , would require observation lengths larger than a few tens or hundreds of centimeters .",
    "the spatial scale available for experimental investigation is typically a few centimeters ( let us say , up to 10 cm , the length of a quite long optical cell ) , so what can actually be measured is the local slope @xmath173 ( see figure [ jumpsize ] , bottom ) , which tends to @xmath174 with increasing optical density .        , with @xmath175 ( see @xcite ) , width=302 ]    figure [ fluo ] shows an image of the fluorescence in the 7cm - long optical cell ( see figure [ setup ] ) , as detected by the ccd camera .",
    "a bright point in the image indicates the position where a photon has been scattered towards the collection optics and the ccd camera .",
    "the brighter the spot , the higher the fluorescence intensity at the corresponding position .",
    "a thin slice of the image , a few tens of pixels wide along the cell s axis , is selected : it corresponds to the volume directly illuminated by the incident photons and where all the first - order scattering events take place ( first scattering of an incident photon by an atom in the vapour ) . above and below the central slice",
    ", the photons have necessarily been scattered at least once in the vapor and contribute to the multiply scattered signal . in figure",
    "[ exp ] the intensity in the central slice is plotted as a function of the position @xmath8 along the cell s axis , after correction for the multiple scattering contribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the profile is plotted in log - log scale , in which a power law is displayed as a straight line .",
    "it is here well fitted by a power law @xmath176 , with @xmath175 @xcite . in any case",
    ", the local slope @xmath177 is always smaller than 3 , i.e. no normal diffusion model can describe the propagation of light in such a medium .",
    "another difficulty arises if the cfr condition is to be fulfilled ( if it is not , complex frequency redistribution functions have to be determined @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency distribution of the impinging photons should therefore be the same as the absorption spectrum of the atoms in the target cell , i.e. a voigt one with same @xmath145 parameter as the vapour .",
    "while this condition is not completely fulfilled in @xcite , an ingenious set of configurations ( basically , the incident photons are prepared so as to result from a growing number of frequency - redistributing scattering events ) allows the observation of the thermalisation of light , i.e. of the evolution from partially to almost completely frequency - redistributed incident photons , with a measured coefficient @xmath162 always @xmath178 , decreasing and tending to the expected value of @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "we have shown how the propagation of light in resonant atomic vapours can exhibit a superdiffusive behavior , characterized by rare , long jumps between two scattering events .",
    "when present , these  lvy flights \" dominate the dynamics of the system and may obliterate long sequences of apparently normal , gaussian - like behavior ( gaussian distribution of jump lengths around a mean value ) .",
    "the physical origin of these rare events is the fact that , due to frequency redistribution , a photon have a very small but finite probability of being scattered with a frequency far from resonance , i.e. of flying a very long distance in the medium , turned almost transparent for this photon .",
    "the non - negligible probability of these long jumps  lifts \" the tail of the jump - size distribution : such  long - tail \" distributions decay asymptotically as power laws , characteristic of scale - free phenomena .",
    "lvy flights occur for distributions @xmath10 decaying slower than @xmath50 , for which the second moment @xmath180 , key element of normal statistics , diverges .",
    "lvy flights have been observed in many other systems but emphasis has been placed on the atomic physics point of view , in which resonant atomic vapours represent the basic object of research .",
    "it is interesting that such a simple system , a paradigm of the most basic light - matter interaction mechanisms , still stirs curiosity and holds surprises .",
    "atomic vapours actually represent small , tunable table - top systems where , depending on the conditions ( temperature , atomic density ) , different diffusion regimes can be studied , as well as transitions between them .",
    "the limited spatial extension of experimental setups actually imposes a cutoff on the jump - length distribution .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , although such a _ truncated lvy flight _ has finite variance , it may take a huge number of individual events for the resulting multi - scattering process to converge to a gaussian one .",
    "the measurement of the segment of the distribution of individual jump lengths that is experimentally accessible is not affected by this cutoff restriction and the number of scattering events in a typical atomic vapour cell or lamp is in general not sufficient to characterize the diffusion regime as a normal one .",
    "it may however affect the actual diffusion regime in _",
    "astrophysical samples_. however restricted the example treated in this article may seem , it illustrates a subject belonging to the much more general topics of nonlinear dynamics and non - normal statistics , at the frontier of current knowledge .",
    "the advances in theoretical tools and experimental techniques allow us to extend our comprehension of the physical world , leading to the exploration of qualitatively new concepts .",
    "these are likely to lead to improved control over the systems in question .",
