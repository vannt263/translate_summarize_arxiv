    "description of a detailed structure of the set of states of quantum system is one of the most important problems in quantum theory . from the general point of view",
    ", the state of the system can be considered as the probability measure @xmath0 on the lattice of projectors @xmath1 defined on the hilbert space @xmath2 of the system . by the gleason theorem @xcite",
    ", such a measure can be characterized by the trace class nonnegative operator @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4 , and @xmath5 thus , the set of states can be identified with convex set of all nonnegative operators with trace equal to one , with extremal points corresponding to pure vector states .",
    "the convex structure of the set of states can be exploited to get some knowledge about the quantum states ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but the structure of this set , even in the case of @xmath6 - level quantum system , is completely known only for @xmath7 .    the simplest bipartite quantum system in which the phenomenon of entanglement occurs consist of two two - level systems ( qubits ) .",
    "the structure of resulting four - level quantum system was the subject of many studies , specially in the context of characterizing of entanglement and entanglement measures ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the geometry of quantum states @xcite .",
    "the important problem of evolution of entanglement in realistic quantum systems interacting with their environments , is also modeled by the dynamics of two - qubit states . in that case the processes of degradation or creation of entanglement can be studied in details ( see e.g. @xcite ) by using analytically computable measure of entanglement given by concurrence @xcite .",
    "much more complex and interesting are processes of disentanglement or creation of entanglement involving multilevel atoms . in such cases ,",
    "quantum interference between different radiative transitions can influence the dynamics of the system . for a pair of three - level atoms the role of interference",
    "was studied in ref .",
    "it is obvious that detailed knowledge of the set of states is crucial for systematic analysis of such phenomena .",
    "even when we focus on two three - level systems ( two qutrits ) , analytic description of entanglement of general states is not possible , so we can try to solve this problem for specific classes of states . in this context , the interesting study of two - qutrit states appeared recently in @xcite , where the analog of the set of bell - diagonal states for two qubits - the simplex @xmath8 , was investigated . since @xmath8 lives in nine - dimensional real linear space ( instead of eighty - dimensional space for all two - qutrit states ) , the investigation of its properties is simpler and one can use symmetries and equivalences inside @xmath8 to classify interesting quantum states and discuss the geometry of entanglement .    in the present paper",
    "we also study the properties of the simplex @xmath8 , but we concentrate on the computation of the measure of entanglement , given by negativity , for some classes of states in @xmath8 . using the symmetry of @xmath8 we can classify mixed states inside @xmath8 with respect to their local equivalence .",
    "as follows from @xcite , all mixtures of two bell states ( for fixed mixing probabilities ) are equivalent and there are two classes of mixtures of three bell states and two of four states . for those states",
    "we compute its negativity analytically or numerically . to obtain some information about general mixed states from @xmath8 , we consider two parameters : negativity and degree of mixture given by linear entropy . on the entropy - negativity plane , the simplex @xmath8 is represented by the region bounded by two curves .",
    "it turns out that on the upper curve lie all werner states i.e. mixtures of maximally mixed state and any maximally entangled bell state .",
    "it means that within @xmath8 , werner states have maximal allowed negativity for given linear entropy . by numerical generation of states lying above the curve of werner states",
    "we show , that similarly as in the case of two qubits , werner states do not maximize entanglement for given entropy .",
    "we start with the construction of simplex @xmath8 .",
    "let us fix the basis @xmath9 for one - qutrit space @xmath10 .",
    "in the space of two qutrits @xmath11 , consider the maximally entangled pure state of the form @xmath12 to construct the basis of @xmath11 consisting of maximally entangled pure `` bell - like '' states , we can proceed as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath13 be the set of pairs of indices @xmath14 , where @xmath15 i.e. the addition and multiplication of indices are understood as modulo @xmath16 .",
    "for each @xmath17 , define the unitary operator @xmath18 as @xmath19 one can check that the operators @xmath18 have the following properties : @xmath20 & & w_{(m , n)}^{\\dagger}=e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}nm}\\,w_{(-m ,- n)}\\\\[2 mm ] & & w_{(m , n)}w_{(k , l)}=e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3}nk}\\,w_{(m+k , n+l)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then to each point @xmath21 we associate the vector @xmath22 , defined as @xmath23 in this way we obtain nine bell - like maximally entangled vectors , which form a basis of the space @xmath11 .",
    "notice that all states ( [ psialfa ] ) are locally equivalent .",
    "the class of states of two qutrits we are considering in the paper , contains all bell - diagonal states i.e. the mixtures of pure states @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "although the simplex ( [ sympleks ] ) constitutes only a small part of the set of all states , it contains interesting entangled mixed states and the problem of separability of general state from @xmath8 is still involved . to proceed further",
    ", we study some equivalence classes within @xmath8 , with respect to the local operations which do not change entanglement properties of states . as was shown in ref . @xcite , such mappings can be considered as transformations of the set of pairs of indices , which form a group of affine transformations @xmath27 where all elements are from @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    using the transformations ( [ grupa ] ) , all subsets of @xmath13 can be classified with respect to the equivalence relation . in particular",
    ", there is one class of single points , one of two points , two classes of three points and two of four points . for three points ,",
    "all lines in @xmath13 i.e. sets of the form @xmath30 are equivalent .",
    "all other sets of three points form another equivalence class . in the case of four points ,",
    "all sets @xmath31 where @xmath32 is any line , are equivalent .",
    "the second class contain all `` rectangles '' @xmath33 in @xmath13 defined as @xmath34 to the equivalence classes of points from @xmath13 correspond equivalence classes of states from the simplex @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , single points @xmath35 define pure states @xmath36 which are locally equivalent by definition . from the pair of points @xmath37 we obtain mixtures @xmath38 and for fixed @xmath39 all such states are locally equivalent .",
    "three points @xmath40 not lying on any line define a class of equivalent mixed states @xmath41 and the second class is given by the states @xmath42 for any line @xmath32 in @xmath13 .",
    "finally , there are two classes of states corresponding to four points : @xmath43 for any rectangle @xmath33 , and @xmath44 for any set @xmath45 .",
    "in the case of compound quantum systems , the main problem is how to distinguish between separable and entangled states .",
    "pure states of the system are entangled if the parts of the system do not have pure states of their own , but for mixed states one can not deduce if they are entangled by considering partial states . for two qubits there is a simple necessary and sufficient criterion for entanglement : states which are non positive after partial transposition ( nppt states ) are entangled @xcite . in the case of two qutrits , we only know that all nppt states are entangled , but there are entangled states which are positive after this operation @xcite . for nppt states , the natural measure of entanglement is based on the trace norm of the partial transposition @xmath46 of the state @xcite .",
    "one defines _",
    "negativity _ of the state @xmath3 as @xmath47 @xmath48 is equal to the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of @xmath46 and is an entanglement monotone @xcite .",
    "notice that ( [ neg ] ) is normalized such that @xmath49 if and only if @xmath3 is maximally entangled .",
    "for any state ( [ ro2 ] ) corresponding to the pair of points in @xmath13 , there is a simple formula for negativity @xmath51 notice that the states ( [ ro2 ] ) are always entangled and minimal value of negativity is attained for symmetric combination of pure states ( fig.1 ) . for three points lying on some line @xmath32",
    ", one can prove by direct computation that @xmath52 in that case , symmetric combination of pure states i.e. the state ( [ rol ] ) such that @xmath53 produces separable state . for the remaining states belonging to other class ( [ ro3 ] ) , we can compute its negativity numerically and we get @xmath54 for every state @xmath55 given by convex combination ( [ ro3 ] ) , where @xmath56 do not belong to the line @xmath32 but the coefficients @xmath57 are the same as in the decomposition ( [ rol ] ) of @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , @xmath59 is always greater then zero ( fig.2 ) .    for nonequivalent states corresponding to four points in @xmath13 , we are only able to compute its negativity numerically . in particular , we study the states @xmath60 and @xmath61 we check numerically that @xmath62 for all such states .",
    "we also plot the surfaces of negativity for fixed @xmath63 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "general mixed states from the simplex @xmath8 can be to some extend characterized by two parameters : degree of entanglement and mixture . to quantify the first we take negativity , and the second is given by normalized linear entropy @xmath64 which vanishes for all pure states and equals to @xmath65 for maximally mixed state @xmath66",
    "one can find general bound on ( [ lentropy ] ) for states which are positive after partial transposition ( ppt states ) , by applying the result : for @xmath67 bipartite quantum system if @xmath3 satisfies @xmath68 then @xmath3 is ppt state @xcite .",
    "thus for two - qutrits we obtain the bound : if @xmath69 then @xmath3 is ppt state and nppt states can only have linear entropies less than this number",
    ".    it would be interesting to find the physically allowed degree of entanglement and mixture for nppt states of two qutrits . in two - qubit case ,",
    "the subset of the entropy - concurrence plane corresponding to possible physical states was characterized by munro et al .",
    "in particular , the states lying on the boundary of this set were identified with maximally entangled mixed states .",
    "similar characterization for two qutrits ( in terms of entropy and negativity ) is not easy and we restrict our investigations to the case of states @xmath50 . since these states are diagonal in the basis ( [ psialfa ] )",
    "@xmath70    explicit relation between linear entropy and negativity can be established for the class of states ( [ rol ] ) . combining ( [ negl ] ) with ( [ lentrw ] )",
    ", one finds that all states @xmath58 lie on the curve on the entropy - negativity plane , given by the equation @xmath71\\label{kl}\\ ] ] for the werner states @xmath72\\label{werner}\\ ] ] direct calculations show that @xmath73 and @xmath74 thus all states ( [ werner ] ) lie on the curve @xmath75\\label{kw}\\ ] ] it turns out that the curves ( [ kl ] ) and ( [ kw ] ) form the boundary of the region on the entropy - negativity plane that is occupied by the states @xmath76 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "it means that in the class @xmath8 , werner states have maximal allowed negativity for a given entropy , whereas the states @xmath58 have a minimal negativity under the same conditions .",
    "it is obvious that the whole region below the curve ( [ kl ] ) , corresponds to physical states of two qutrits . on the other hand ,",
    "since the maximal allowed linear entropy of werner states is less than the value which follows from the bound ( [ purity ] ) , there should exist physical states above the curve ( [ kw ] ) . in the other words , the werner states are not maximally entangled states for given linear entropy",
    "this conjecture was confirmed by numerical generation of two - qutrit states lying above the curve of werner states ( fig.4 ) .",
    "it is difficult to generate such states , and we were able to find them only for limited values of negativity .",
    "for this reason , we can not predict the curve of maximally entangled mixed states .",
