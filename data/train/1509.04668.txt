    "our understanding about the universe is based upon the standard cosmological model known as the big bang theory .",
    "the main feature of the big bang theory is the expansion of the universe . under this base ,",
    "as the universe expands it has been cooling . during its cosmological expansion ,",
    "the universe underwent a series of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "these phase transitions are characterized by spontaneously broken gauge symmetries , and have important roles in the cosmological context @xcite .",
    "they provide a mechanism for the formation of topological defects that can be described by classical field theories whose configurations of vacuum have elegant and topologically stable solutions with relevant physical implications .",
    "such solutions are specified as domain wall , monopoles and cosmic strings among others @xcite . between them",
    "cosmic strings are the most studied .",
    "they can be considered as candidate to explain the temperature anisotropies of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , or associated to emission of gravitational wave and high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "string - like solutions were obtained by nielsen and olesen @xcite through a relativistic classical field theory considering a system composed by abelian and non - abelain gauge fields coupled with higgs fields . in the system under consideration a potential interaction which present non - trivial vacuum solution was taking into account .",
    "this potential is responsible for the spontaneously broken of gauge symmetries .",
    "the authors were able to find static , cylindrically symmetric and stable solution from the equations of motion , which corresponds to a magnetic field along the @xmath2direction .",
    "this solution was named *",
    "vortex*. unfortunately the complete set of equations associated with this topological object is non - linear and , in general , there is no closed solution for it .",
    "only asymptotic expressions , for points near or very far from the vortex s core , can be found for the higgs and gauge fields .",
    "a more complex system is formed when one decides to analyze the influence of this linear defect on the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "this huge challenge was faced initially by garfinkle @xcite and two years later by laguna and matzner @xcite considering the abelian version of the nielsen and olesen model .",
    "the authors have shown that there exists a class of static cylindrically symmetric solutions of these equations representing a string ; moreover , they have showed that these solutions approach asymptotically to a minkowski spacetime minus a wedge .",
    "linet in @xcite analyzed a special kind of abelian vortex solution that satisfy the bps condition , and showed that for the case of infinity electric charge and higgs field self - coupling limit , it possible to obtain exact solutions for the metric tensor , which is determined in terms of the linear energy density of the string .",
    "the analysis of the spacetime geometry in the presence of an infinitely long , straight , static , abelian cosmic string formed during phase transitions at energy scales larger than the grand - unified - theory scale were developed in @xcite . for these supermassive configurations , two different types of solutions were found : one @xcite in which the components of metric tensor @xmath3 vanish at finite distance from the axis , and in the other where these components remain finite everywhere while @xmath4 decreases outside the core of the string .",
    "although both types of geometries present different asymptotic behaviors , they are solutions of the same set of differential equations . this apparent contradiction was clarified in the papers @xcite , where the authors pointed out that the coexistence of two different kinds of solutions are consequence of boundary conditions imposed on the metric fields .",
    "in fact the two different kinds of asymptotic behaviors for the metric tensor correspond to the two different branches of cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "the solution analyzed in @xcite corresponds to the so called melvin branch ; and the case analyzed in @xcite corresponds to the so called string branch .",
    "the string branch solutions are those of astrophysical interest , since they describe solutions with a deficit of planar angle @xcite ; moreover , the melvin branch has no flat spacetime counterpart . in @xcite",
    "was discussesed how the presence of multiple supermassive cosmic strings in the abelian model can induce the spontaneous compactication of the transverse space to a cosmic string , and to construct solutions where the gravitational background becomes regular everywhere .    in general relativity ,",
    "de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetimes are maximally symmetric solution of einstein s field equations in the presence of a positive and negative cosmological constant , @xmath5 , respectively . due the symmetry of de sitter and anti - de sitter spacetimes , numerous physical problems have been exactly solved . in particular , astronomical observations of high redshift supernovae , galaxy clusters and cosmic microwave background @xcite indicate that at the present epoch we live in universe that may be described by de sitter spacetime . on the other hand , anti - de sitter spacetime plays an important role in theoretical physics such as the realization of the holographic principle known as ads / cft correpondence @xcite .",
    "so , in the context of gravitating local cosmic string , a natural question takes place : how does the presence of cosmological constant , positive or negative , modify the geometry of the spacetime produced by an abelian or non - abelian cosmic string ?",
    "the answer to this question is the main objective of the present analysis .",
    "in fact the numerical analysis of the abelian nielsen and olesen string minimally coupled to gravity including a positive cosmological constant have been studied in @xcite . moreover",
    ", the analysis of abelian strings in a fixed background spacetime with positive cosmological constant has investigated in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spherically symmetric topological defect named global monopole @xcite , was investigated in ds and ads spacetimes by li and hao in @xcite and by bertrand at all in @xcite .    in the paper by nielsen and",
    "olesen the non - abelian string system is described by a @xmath6 gauge invariant lagrangian density composed by gauge fields and two higgs sectors .",
    "a potential responsible for the spontaneously gauge symmetry broken is present .",
    "the analysis of the non - abelian nielsen and olesen string and its influence on the geometry of the spacetime , was only recently considered in @xcite . in this analysis",
    "it was not take into account the presence of any cosmological constant .",
    "all the modifications in the minkowski spacetime were caused by the defect .",
    "so , as an addition motivation to develop this work , we would like to complete this analysis considering now that the non - abelian string , and also tne abelian one , are in ds and ads spacetimes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the non - abelian higgs model in de sitter and anti - de sitter spaces and analyze the conditions that the physical parameters contained in the potential should satisfy in order the system presents stable topological solutions .",
    "also we present the ansatz for the higgs and gauge fields , and for the metric tensor .",
    "the equations of motion and boundary conditions are presented in section [ motion ] . in section",
    "[ numerical ] we provide our numerical results , exhibiting the behaviors of the higgs , gauge and metric fields as functions of the distance to the core of the string .",
    "moreover , we present a comparison of the non - abelian system in minkowski , de sitter and anti - de sitter spaces , and pointed out the most relevant aspects that distinguish the behaviors of those fields in the presence / absence of cosmological constant . finally in section [ concl ] we give our conclusions .",
    "in previous work @xcite it has been studied the behavior of gravitating non - abelian strings in the absence of cosmological constant . in that paper",
    "it was mainly considered the planar angle deficit in the spacetime caused by the string and the the energy density by unit length associated with this system , and compare both quantity , separately , with the corresponding ones for the abelian string .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine the influence of the cosmological constant in the non - abelian and abelian cosmic strings spacetimes . for the present purposes , we introduce the cosmological constant in the model described by the following action , @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ricci scalar",

    "the potential above has different properties according to the sign of @xmath25 @xcite :    * for @xmath26 , the potential has positive value and its minimum is attained for @xmath27 and @xmath28 . * for @xmath29 ,",
    "these configuration lead to saddle points and two minima occur for : @xmath30 and @xmath31 the values of the potential for these cases are , respectively , @xmath32 both values for @xmath33 are negatives , since @xmath29 .",
    "first let us consider the most general , cylindrically symmetric line element invariant under boosts along z - direction . by using cylindrical coordinates ,",

    "the boundary conditions imposed on the fields at origin are determined by the requirements of regularity at this point .",
    "however , the sign of the cosmological constant , @xmath60 , will establish different kinds of the boundary conditions for the matter and gauge fields at large distance .    * for de sitter space @xmath61 ,",
    "the boudary conditions for the matter and gauge fields are : @xmath62 as we shall see , the cosmological constant will provide a cosmological horizon for the metric tensor . then we must integrate the equations until this value of the coordinate , @xmath63 , in order to have the core of the cosmic string located inside the horizon .",
    "so , we require : @xmath64 * for anti - de sitter space @xmath65 , the cosmological horizon does not appear .",
