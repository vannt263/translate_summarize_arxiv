    "a famous question of m. kac , @xmath0can one hear the shape of a drum ?",
    "`` , is concerned with isospectrality of the planar domains @xcite .",
    "the bounded domains @xmath1 and @xmath2 are called isospectral if two domains have the same eigenvalue spectrum up to the degree of multiplicities , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 kac s question is alternatively stated as @xmath0are the planar domains @xmath1 and @xmath2 congruent if @xmath3 ? '' .",
    "iso - length spectrality of the domains is analogously introduced for the length spectrum of closed billiard trajectories on the corresponding domains @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "also for iso - length spectrality one can pose the same question as kac s .",
    "the problem we discuss here is equivalence between isospectrality and iso - length spectrality on the planar domains of a certain class .",
    "if either the eigenvalue spectrum or the length spectrum determines the shape of the domain uniquely , the equivalence problem becomes obvious since a congruent pair of domains trivially provides both isospectrum and iso - length spectrum .",
    "however , it is known that there exists a non - trivial case where equivalence between isospectrality and iso - length spectrality is concluded .",
    "such a situation was reported by milnor for the first time @xcite .",
    "it is known that there exist the self - dual lattices @xmath5 and @xmath6 in @xmath7 which are not congruent in the sense that no rotation of @xmath7 carries @xmath5 to @xmath6 , nevertheless they own the same length spectrum . that is , the quotients of @xmath7 by these lattices , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are non - isometric but iso - length spectral . furthermore its isospectrality can also be derived from the exact trace formula which represents duality relation between the spectrum of laplacian acting on the flat torus and the corresponding length spectrum of closed geodesics .",
    "the flat torus which is defined as a quotient @xmath10 of @xmath11 by a lattice @xmath12 of rank @xmath13 , the set of eigenvalues of helmholtz equation @xmath14 is explicitly given as , @xmath15 here @xmath16 denotes the dual lattice of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding length spectrum which is the set of closed geodesics on the same torus is expressed just by the distance between the origin and each lattice point on @xmath12 : @xmath18 the two spectra are connected via poisson s summation formula or jacobi identity : @xmath19 this trace formula immediately leads us to equivalence between the isospectrality and iso - length spectrality , that is , two flat tori are isospectral if and only if they have the same length spectrum .",
    "milnor s work is not a direct answer to the original version of kac s question because it is not concerned with the planar domains .",
    "but from milnor s example one learned that there really exist non - congruent domains with a common length and eigenvalue spectrum .    in more general cases where two riemannian manifolds have a common finite riemannian covering , a sufficient condition for isospectrality",
    "was given by sunada @xcite .",
    "let @xmath20 be a finite group which acts freely on a certain compact riemannian manifold @xmath21 by isometries .",
    "sunada s theorem tells us that the _ quotients @xmath22 and @xmath23 are isospectral if there exist two subgroups @xmath24 and @xmath25 of @xmath20 , which satisfy so - called almost conjugate condition : @xmath26\\cap h_1 ) = ^\\sharp ( [ g]\\cap h_2)\\ ] ] for any conjugacy class @xmath27 $ ] in g. _ the proof is based on a sort of trace formula which can be regarded as a prototype of the selberg trace formula @xcite . if subgroups @xmath24 and @xmath25 are conjugate in the usual sense , then these quotients @xmath22 and @xmath23 are merely isometric .",
    "however it had been known that there exist triplets @xmath28 so that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are almost conjugate but not conjugate in @xmath20 .",
    "such triplets were used to construct some isospectral but non - isometric pairs of riemannian surfaces by buser @xcite and brooks and tse @xcite .",
    "sunada also proved that @xmath22 and @xmath23 have the same length spectrum of closed geodesics @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case , iso - length spectrality is derived together with isospectrality from the same source .    in case of planar domains , after a quarter of century , gordon , webb , and wolpert @xcite solved kac s original question also negatively by constructing an isospectral but non - congruent pair of planar domains ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for the construction",
    ", they used a version of sunada s theorem , which was extended to the orbiford ( billiard ) setting by brard @xcite . since the source of isospectrality was sunada s theorem",
    ", iso - length spectrality naturally follows as well .",
    "however , if there exists an isospectral pair of planar domains which are not given by sunada s construction , equivalence of isospectrality and iso - length spectrality can not straightforwardly be discussed .",
    "in fact , no one can exclude such a situation because the sunada s condition gives merely a sufficient condition for the isospectrality and also iso - length spectrality . nevertheless , as we will show below , it is possible to relate them through the notion of so - called _ transplantation of eigenfunctions_. the transplantation method is originally invented by buser , conway , doyle , and semmler to reexamine isospectrality of some given domains @xcite .",
    "they constructed 17 families of isospectral pairs of domains based on the sunada s method , and confirmed these isospectrality by the transplantation method . as far as planar domains are concerned , these pairs are , to authors knowledge , all isospectral pairs ever known .",
    "it should be remarked that the transplantation method is not independent of the sunada s theorem . in the above case of quotient manifolds",
    ", brooks gave an alternative proof of sunada s theorem based on the transplantation method , which appears a necessary condition for the assumption of the theorem @xcite .",
    "however equivalence between these two methods has not been proved in case of planar domains .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first explain the transplantation method in section 2 and give its matrix representation in section 3 . in section 4 , we provide a proof showing that isospectrality and iso - length spectrality is equivalent for a certain class of domains , that is , those domains constructed by successive unfolding of a fundamental building block .",
    "all isospectral pairs ever known belong to this class . in section 5",
    "we enumerate isospectral pairs of domains and compared them with the table obtained by buser , conway , doyle , and semmler @xcite .",
    "it is shown that our labor of searching isospectral pairs is considerably reduced as a bi - product of our result in section 4 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summary and discussion of our work .",
    "let us consider two domains @xmath1 and @xmath2 as fig .",
    "2 . we here describe the transplantation method by taking an example of the proof of isospectrality based on it .",
    "we follow the exposition given by buser @xcite .",
    "transplantation is a procedure which is cutting an arbitrary function @xmath29 defined on @xmath1 into its restrictions on each building block , say @xmath30 , and rebuilding a new function @xmath31 on @xmath2 by superposing @xmath30 .",
    "note that such a procedure relied crucially on the peculiarity of the domains , which are composed of several pieces obtained by successive reflection of a certain common building block .    by the transplantation shown in fig . 2 , any eigenfunction @xmath29 with any eigenvalue @xmath32 on @xmath1",
    "is transplanted onto @xmath2 so that the transform @xmath31 is also an eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue @xmath32 .",
    "this can actually be confirmed by checking the following conditions :    * _ @xmath33 in the interior of each piece . _ + this is always true because @xmath31 is given as a sum of several @xmath34 s on each piece . * _ the function g is smoothly connected on all reflecting segments _ + this is not trivial , but true on this example . on the reflecting segment @xmath35 in fig .",
    "2 , for example , @xmath36 fits smoothly with @xmath37 because @xmath38 and @xmath39 , or @xmath40 and @xmath41 was smoothly connected on the original domain @xmath1 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 also fits smoothly on the segment by the reflection principle .",
    "we can also check the smoothness condition on the other reflecting segments in the same way . * _ the function g vanishes on the boundary of _ @xmath2 .",
    "+ this is not trivial , but true on this example .",
    "on the boundary segment @xmath44 in fig .",
    "2 , for example , @xmath36 vanishes because @xmath42 cancels @xmath38 there and @xmath45 was already zero .",
    "we can also check the boundary condition on the other boundary segments in the same way .",
    "one more condition is invertibility of transplantation , which guarantees that the dimensions of the space belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath32 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the multiplicity of @xmath32 , on @xmath1 is equal to the dimension on @xmath2 or less .",
    "this is expressed as the condition ,    * _ the transplantation is invertible as a linear map . _ + this is not trivial , but can be easily checked to be true for this example .    thus these four conditions lead to @xmath46 .",
    "the last condition becomes the check to see that any eigenfunction with any eigenvalue @xmath47 on @xmath2 can be transplanted onto @xmath1 conversely , that is , @xmath48 . in this way , we know that these two domains are isospectral .",
    "these are conditions for eigenfunctions satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions , but they are also neumann isospectral .",
    "this can be verified by changing all the minus signs before each element of transplanted function @xmath34 to the plus one when one superposes them on the transformed domain .",
    "conversely it is possible to construct dirichlet isospectral pairs once neumann isospectral are at hand .",
    "the procedure is as follows : ( i ) for both domains , attach the code @xmath49 1 or -1 to each building block @xmath50 such that the codes of neighboring blocks are different , ( ii ) let the building block @xmath50 with code @xmath51 be transformed onto the building block @xmath52 with code @xmath53 , and if @xmath54 = 1 then the sign before @xmath34 is set to be plus and otherwise minus .",
    "it is easy to show that the resulting pair of domains are dirichlet isospectral .",
    "therefore , isospectrality with respect to the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions is equivalent .",
    "we also remark that the above proof is independent of the choice of a building block .",
    "this means that this example represents not only a single pair of isospectral domains but also a family of isospectral pairs , which are realized by replacing a building triangle simultaneously with another shaped building block .",
    "in particular , we can obtain the example of gordon . in fig . 1 by replacing the building block in fig . 2 by a heptagon .",
    "in this section , we provide an alternative and more transparent condition for the _ transplantability _ of eigenfunctions . in what follows ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the class of domains constructed by successive reflection of a fundamental building block , which we call _ unfolded domains _ , since transplantation of eigenfunctions is most simply done between such domains . in order to make successive unfolding possible , each building block",
    "is supposed to have three line segments at which the building block is reflected .",
    "the domains shown in figs 1 and 2 are the examples .",
    "hereafter we denote @xmath55 as the number of building blocks composing the unfolded domain .",
    "the whole shape of the unfolded domain is determined by the choice of the building block and the rule specifying unfolding .",
    "the unfolding rule can be identified with the edge - colored graph and the correspondence is given in table 1 . each piece obtained by reflection",
    "is represented by the vertex of the graph , and the reflecting segment by its edge .",
    "the three boundary segments of the building block are distinguished by the color of the edges .",
    "some boundary segments of the building block form the boundary of the whole unfolded domain , and we represent the edge corresponding to one of such boundary segments as the closed loop .",
    "an example of edge - colored graph is demonstrated in fig .",
    "ccc unfolding rule & & edge - colored graph + pieces & @xmath56 & vertices + reflecting segments & @xmath56 & edges + kind of segment & @xmath56 & color of edge +        the structure of a graph is also represented by the adjacency matrix .",
    "that is , the reflecting rule to generate an unfolded domain @xmath57 is given by the triplet of adjacency matrices @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 defined as follows : @xmath61 @xmath62 diagonal element @xmath63 is set to be 1 if the piece @xmath50 has the boundary segment @xmath64 .",
    "the adjacency matrix is , in general , not uniquely determined even if one fixed the graph because there remains a freedom to determine the order of labeling vertices . in this",
    "setting , two unfolded domains @xmath57 and @xmath65 are congruent if there exists a permutation matrix @xmath66 such that @xmath67 here the permutation matrix is defined as a @xmath68 matrix in which each row or column has only one unity , and all the other elements are zero . if the building block has some symmetry , for example reflecting symmetry with respect to a certain axis , it might happen that non - permutation matrix connects the congruent pair @xmath57 and @xmath65 .",
    "however , if one destructs the symmetry by changing the shape of the building block , such an @xmath0accidental \" situation can be avoided . the condition ( [ congruent ] ) for a permutation matrix @xmath66 , therefore , becomes the necessary and sufficient condition for the congruency of @xmath57 and @xmath65 in this sense .",
    "next we give the condition for transplantability of eigenfunction of two given unfolded domains using the adjacency matrices . by transplantability we mean the possibility that isospectrality of a pair of unfolded domains can be verified by the transplantation method .    the transplantation procedure described in section 3",
    "is explicitly expressed as follows .",
    "let @xmath57 and @xmath65 be two unfolded domains composed of @xmath55 copies of a common building block .",
    "let @xmath69 be a linear transformation .",
    "we say that the transformation @xmath70 is a _ transplantation _ if the transform @xmath31 is obtained by cutting and pasting @xmath29 , namely , @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote restrictions of @xmath29 and @xmath74 to each piece , respectively . also as mentioned in section 2 , it is not trivial at all that the transform @xmath31 becomes an eigenfunction on the transformed domain at this stage .    for",
    "given unfolded domains @xmath57 and @xmath65 , we say that they are _ transplantable _ if there exists an invertible transplantation @xmath70 satisfying the following conditions : @xmath75 it can be easily checked that smoothness on all the reflecting segments and the boundary conditions on the unfolded domains are satisfied if the above conditions are fulfilled . here",
    ", existence of the inverse matrix @xmath76 corresponds to the invertible condition . the condition ( [ transplantable ] ) is the one for transplantability of neumann boundary condition , but as remarked in section 2 , it is equivalent to transplantability of the dirichlet case .",
    "as was seen in the previous section , @xmath57 and @xmath65 are isospectral if they are transplantable .",
    "note that if @xmath70 is a permutation matrix , then @xmath57 and @xmath65 are merely congruent .",
    "therefore , in order to construct isospectral but non - congruent pair of unfolded domains , we must find a matrix satisfying the condition ( [ transplantable ] ) , but not a permutation matrix .",
    "we next consider the length spectrum of the unfolded domain .",
    "the length spectrum is the set of length of closed trajectories or periodic orbits on the billiard domain .",
    "we first consider the relation between closed trajectories on the unfolded domain @xmath57 and its fundamental building block @xmath77 .",
    "note that any periodic orbit on @xmath57 can be regarded as the lift of a closed trajectory on @xmath77 , because its projection is always a periodic orbit on @xmath77 .",
    "however , the converse is not necessarily true . a single closed orbit on @xmath77 yields @xmath55 trajectories as its lift on the unfolded domain @xmath57 , which are sometimes closed orbits on @xmath57 but the others not . by the construction of the adjacency matrix @xmath78 , it is easy to see that the number of closed lifts of a given closed trajectory on @xmath77 is counted as @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the sequence representing in which order a given closed trajectory on @xmath77 hits the boundary segments ( for example , see fig .",
    "such a sequence is not determined uniquely for a given closed orbit .",
    "in fact , if @xmath81 is a sequence specifying some closed trajectory , then all sequences obtained by its cyclic shift such as @xmath82 , @xmath83 , _ etc .",
    "_ can be regarded as the sequence giving to the same closed trajectory .",
    "however the number of closed lifts is invariant because of the relation : @xmath84 thus the length spectrum of closed trajectories for @xmath57 is determined by the length spectrum for @xmath77 and @xmath85 .     with the sequence @xmath86 .",
    "for the sequence @xmath64 , @xmath85 is equal to 1 . ]    in order that two unfolded domains @xmath57 and @xmath65 constructed by the same - shaped building block @xmath77 have the same length spectrum , it is sufficient that the numbers of closed lifts should coincide for all possible sequences of @xmath64 . it can easily be checked that @xmath85 and @xmath87 are invariant if @xmath57 and @xmath65 are transplantable , _",
    "i.e. , _ the condition ( [ transplantable ] ) is satisfied for the adjacent matrices of @xmath57 and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore we obtain the following claim .",
    "* proposition 1 *    the inverse of the above proposition is to inquire whether or not @xmath88 gives the sufficient condition for transplantability .",
    "the following statement gives its answer : the condition @xmath88 is precisely the analog of the transplantability of eigenfunctions .",
    "* proposition 2 *    _ proof_we have shown that transplantability implies isospectrality in section 3 . here",
    "we will show that transplantability follows from @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath89 and @xmath90 be the groups generated by adjacency matrices : @xmath91 since adjacency matrices themselves are also permutation matrices introduced in section 4 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are subgroups of the symmetric group @xmath92 , so they are finite .",
    "let @xmath93 be a free group generated by characters @xmath94 , @xmath44 , and @xmath95 .",
    "we can define surjective homomorphism : @xmath96 then @xmath89 is isomorphic to @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath90 is also isomorphic to @xmath98 .",
    "we now assume that @xmath88 for any sequence @xmath64 , and note that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes @xmath101 identity matrix .",
    "then we have @xmath102 here @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath89 is isomorphic to @xmath90 .",
    "we can suppose identity maps : @xmath107 to be linear representations of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath89 is isomorphic to @xmath90 , @xmath108 is another linear representation of @xmath89 .",
    "note that @xmath85 and @xmath87 become the characters of representations @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively , and they are equal by our assumption .",
    "character theory tells that two representations with the same character are similar@xcite .",
    "this means that there exists an invertible matrix @xmath70 such that @xmath111 this leads to transplantability between @xmath57 and @xmath65 .",
    "( q.e.d )    by propositions 1 and 2 , we know equivalence between transplantability and coincidence of the numbers of closed lifts , which are sufficient conditions for isospectrality and iso - length spectrality respectively",
    ". however if we assume transplantability , which is more strict condition than isospectrality , then iso - length spectrality follows .",
    "conversely , we assume coincidence of the numbers of closed lifts , as a sufficient condition for iso - length spectrality , then isospectrality follows .",
    "our results can be summarized as the following schema .",
    "as an application of the above propositions , we enumerate isospectral pairs of unfolded domains whose isospectrality can be verified by the transplantation method .",
    "the candidate space we have to explore is the set @xmath114 which consists of all possible edge - colored graphs without cycles , each of which represents an unfolding rule .",
    "the absence of cycles guarantees for the unfolded domain to be formed flatly for any shaped building block .",
    "the advantage to use the propositions 1 and 2 ( and their proof ) is that even for the purpose of listing up transplantable pairs(or triplets if possible ) , we do not have to make pairwise comparisons .",
    "this is because we can regard each relation @xmath88 as a necessary condition for the transplantability of @xmath57 and @xmath65 , and use each relation as a @xmath0filter \" to pick up transplantable candidates .",
    "more precise steps to find out the transplantable pairs is as follows :    1 .   for all edge - colored graphs @xmath57 in @xmath114 ,",
    "compute the character @xmath85 for all possible @xmath64 .",
    "2 .   prepare the spectrum of characters @xmath115 by ordering the character @xmath85 according to an appropriate rule for @xmath64 ( lexicographical order of sequence @xmath64 , for example ) .",
    "3 .   pick up the pair of edge - colored graphs whose character spectra are the same .    according to the proposition 2 , if one finds the identical character spectra , _",
    "@xmath115 = @xmath116 , they yield the transplantable pairs . one might be afraid that the step ( i ) , _",
    "i.e. , _ enumeration of the character spectrum seems to require infinite number of steps , reflecting the fact that @xmath64 should run over all possible sequences composed of @xmath117 .",
    "however , this is not the case , since @xmath89 only forms a finite group as mentioned in the proof of proposition 2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that coincidence of the @xmath0ground state `` , _ i.e. _ , @xmath118 for null sequence of @xmath64 leads that the number of building blocks forming the unfolded domains is equal , which can be read that the area of two domains are equal .",
    "also the condition for the @xmath0first exited state '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath118 where @xmath119 , gives the condition for the length of the boundary to coincide .",
    "these geometrical quantities agree with the first and second terms in the weyl expansion respectively @xcite .",
    "cccccc @xmath55 & @xmath120 & & @xmath55 & @xmath120 & + 2 & 3 & none & 8 & 450 & none + 3 & 3 & none & 9 & 1326 & none + 4 & 10 & none & 10 & 4262 & none + 5 & 18 & none & 11 & 13566 & none + 6 & 57 & none & 12 & 44772 & none + 7 & 143 & 7 pairs & 13 & 148577 & 26 pairs +     represents three distinguishable pairs of domains for a fixed building block . ]",
    "applying the above procedure to the edge colored graphs up to @xmath121 , we have enumerated all possible transplantable pairs , which are listed in table 2 .",
    "5 shows isospectral pairs ever known , which are listed in @xcite .",
    "our result completely agrees with the list of known transplantable pairs presented in fig . 5 at least up to @xmath122 .",
    "note that all 17 examples given in @xcite have been generated based on the sunada s method .",
    "we have shown that transplantability of eigenfunctions on unfolded domains is equivalent to coincidence of the character spectrum @xmath123 .",
    "the former is a sufficient condition for isospectrality and the latter for iso - length spectrality .    as mentioned in the introduction , if so - called _ almost conjugate condition _",
    "( [ acc ] ) is satisfied for a pair of subgroups @xmath24 and @xmath25 , one knows that the quotients @xmath22 and @xmath23 are isospectral , and iso - length spectrality of @xmath22 and @xmath23 simultaneously follows .",
    "the first counter example of kac s original problem has been constructed with this sunada s condition @xcite . once an isospectral pair is obtained based on such a group theoretical argument together with the orbifold construction , one can easily check isospectrality of the resulting pair using the transplantation method . in this way , at the beginning , transplantation procedure serves only as a check or demonstration for a given pair of domains to be really isospectral .",
    "it is uncertain whether or not there exist transplantable pairs of domains which are not constructed based on the sunada s condition , while the sunada s condition is a sufficient condition for transplantability .",
    "however , by expressing an explicit condition ( [ acc ] ) for transplantability using adjacency matrices , one notices the similarity between the almost conjugate condition ( [ acc ] ) in sunada s theorem and the condition for existence of non permutation matrix @xmath70 in ( [ transplantable ] ) . even if there exists an invertible matrix @xmath70 satisfying ( [ transplantable ] ) , it is not necessarily true that they give an isospectral pair because they are congruent if @xmath70 is merely a permutation matrix .",
    "such a situation reminds us of the case where the almost conjugate condition ( [ acc ] ) is satisfied but the subgroups @xmath24 and @xmath25 are conjugate , which gives only an isometric pair .",
    "therefore it would become a natural question to inquire about the relation between the sunada s construction of isospectral domains and the transplantation method .",
    "numerical enumeration attempted in section 5 elucidated that at least up to @xmath122 all the transplantable pairs are those pairs derived by sunada s method .",
    "this suggests the possibility of its equivalence .",
    "the condition @xmath124 for all possible sequences of @xmath64 , which is equivalent to transplantability of eigenfunctions , provides not only an efficient algorithm to enumerate transplantable pairs of planar domains , but has an interesting @xmath0geometrical \" interpretation : each @xmath85 plays a role of the coefficient of weyl expansion as mentioned in section 5 .",
    "transplantation method , on which we have relied in this paper , is available only to the class of unfolded domains . whether isospectrality is equivalent to iso - length spectrality in more general domains is still an open problem .",
