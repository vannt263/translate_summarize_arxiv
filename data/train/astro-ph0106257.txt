    "the supernova remnant g347.30.5 ( rosat catalog source name : rx j1713.73946 ) is one of a growing number of supernova remnants ( snrs ) showing nonthermal x - ray emission attributed to shock accelerated electrons . in some cases ,",
    "the nonthermal emission is evidenced by continuum emission extending to @xmath310  kev or above , usually superimposed with weak lines , or , as with sn1006 , g347.3 - 0.5 , and g266.2 - 1.2 , by a complete lack of line emission in the observed x - ray band . in all cases where",
    "the emission is not associated with a compact object , the nonthermal x - rays have been interpreted as synchrotron  emission from shock accelerated tev electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if this is true , the existence of these tev electrons has important implications , not only for the production of cosmic rays , but also for the thermal properties of the shock heated , x - ray emitting gas in snrs .",
    "here we compare broad - band observations of g347.30.5 with results from a model combining hydrodynamic simulations of snr evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) with nonlinear diffusive particle acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observations combine new radio data from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) with existing x - ray @xcite and @xmath0-ray data @xcite .",
    "our broad - band comparison of observations and model fits is a powerful way to constrain model parameters , but uncertainties from directly comparing radio , x - ray , and @xmath0-ray observations are unavoidable and should be kept in mind . in an attempt to limit errors from uncertainties in emission volumes , we only consider observations from the northwest portion of g347.3@xmath40.5where the center of the tev @xmath0-ray response function coincides with the brightest radio and x - ray emission .",
    "previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that the steepness of the nonthermal x - ray synchrotron  spectrum in shell - like snrs results because these photons are generated by electrons in the steeply falling , high - energy tail of the distribution . the actual maximum electron energy , however , depends on the magnetic field strength , @xmath5 , in the emission region . if these electrons are accelerated by the first - order fermi shock acceleration mechanism as we assume , it is almost certain that the same shocks accelerate ions , but no clear evidence of superthermal ions has yet been obtained ( i.e. , no pion - decay  feature has been unambiguously identified at @xmath6 mev in snrs ) . until a pion - decay  feature",
    "is observed , all information on the energetic ions must be obtained through modeling . in shocks accelerating particles efficiently , the unseen ions dominate the shock dynamics and largely control the electron emission features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our main results are : ( i ) a spherically symmetric , wind - shell model with efficient acceleration can produce broad - band continuum spectra in excellent agreement with the observations of g347.3 - 0.5 ; ( ii ) test - particle models of g347.3@xmath40.5  ( i.e. ,  ones where less than a few percent of the total energy ends up in relativistic particles ) can be excluded with good confidence ; ( iii ) the maximum electron energy in g347.3@xmath40.5  is well below @xmath7 ev .",
    "thus , g347.3@xmath40.5  joins several other snrs now known _ not _ to produce electrons above @xmath7 ev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , well below the so - called knee in the galactic cosmic - ray spectrum at @xmath2 ev .",
    "the maximum proton energy depends somewhat on whether or not the ambient magnetic field is compressed by the shock .",
    "if the field is compressed as the density , the maximum proton energy is approximately the same as the electron @xmath8 . in the other extreme , where no compression of the field occurs",
    ", we find that g347.3 - 0.5 could currently be producing protons to @xmath9 tev and fe@xmath10 to @xmath2 ev .",
    "unless substantial magnetic field amplification occurs , g347.3@xmath40.5will not produce higher energy protons as it ages ; and ( iv ) our main conclusions concerning maximum particle energies and acceleration efficiency , are relatively insensitive to uncertainties stemming from the morphology of g347.3@xmath40.5 .",
    "there are strong arguments for a snr origin of cosmic rays based mainly on ion composition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and total energy requirements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observations of nonthermal x - ray emission showing that tev electrons are produced in snrs adds support for this argument .",
    "however , there is still no direct evidence that ions are generated in particular snrs in a fashion consistent with cosmic - ray observations . the low maximum proton energy inferred for",
    "g347.3 - 0.5 may present a problem for the scenario that snrs are the main sources of galactic cosmic rays below the knee and suggest that the cosmic - ray proton component above @xmath11 ev might come from some subset of snrs substantially different from g347.3@xmath40.5 .",
    "alternatively , young snrs which only produce @xmath12 ev particles when they are bright in x - rays , may somehow be able to produce higher energy particles at later times , perhaps by amplifying the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the high magnetic fields inferred for cas a make it likely that this particular remnant _ does _ produce @xmath2 ev protons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "g347.3@xmath40.5 was observed with the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( asca ) on 1997 march 25 for a total of 50  ks using three pointings of 10  ks duration and one ( in the fainter southeast region ) of 20  ks duration @xcite . unlike the line - dominated x - ray spectra typical of snrs",
    ", the spectrum for g347.3@xmath40.5 is observed to be featureless and to extend to at least 10  kev , where the asca effective area becomes very small .",
    "a power law spectrum provides an excellent fit to the x - ray data , with some indication that the spectral index varies between the brighter shell regions and the more diffuse interior and eastern regions .",
    "the brightest x - ray emission occurs along the northwest limb of the snr ( see figure  [ fig : g347image ] ) , where there is some indication that the remnant may be interacting with a molecular cloud or a stellar wind bubble shell , although the low inferred density for this region more likely indicates some density enhancement caused by a perturbation of the pre - sn wind .",
    "the unabsorbed flux density from this region of the remnant is @xmath13 with a power law photon index of @xmath14    described here are new radio observations of g347.30.5 made with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , a six - element synthesis telescope located near narrabri , nsw , australia .",
    "observations at 1.36  ghz were carried out in january , march , and april 1998 , in each case in a different array configuration to give maximal @xmath15 coverage .",
    "the field was imaged in a 10-point mosaic , to ensure that the entire extent of the snr , as well as nearby bright sources , were in the field - of - view .",
    "the interferometric visibilities were edited to remove corrupted data and interference .",
    "calibrations were then applied to solve for the time - variable atmospheric gains above each antenna and for the polarization leakage in the receivers .",
    "an absolute flux density scale was applied to the data using observations of pks  b1934638 , for which a flux density of 15.0  jy was assumed at a frequency of 1.4  ghz .",
    "the visibilities from all 10 pointings were then inverted to produce a single image , which was deconvolved using the mosaiced maximum entropy approach described by @xcite .",
    "the final image was then produced by applying a gaussian restoring beam of dimensions @xmath16 .",
    "the sum of the flux from the two bright filaments in the northwest region of the remnant ( indicated in figure  [ fig : g347image ] and labeled as arc 1 and 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to that from which the x - ray flux above was measured , is @xmath17 . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "while arc 2 ( the right - most arc in figure  [ fig : g347image ] ) is askew from the perceived snr shell , it does overlap an x - ray filament .",
    "arcs 1 and 2 have approximately the same radio flux .",
    "g347.3 - 0.5 has also been detected at tev energies with the cangaroo 3.8 m atmospheric imaging erenkov telescope @xcite .",
    "as with the x - ray and radio observations , the @xmath18 detection is from the nw rim of the remnant ( indicated with a circle in figure  [ fig : g347image ] ) and has an estimated flux of @xmath19 } \\pm 1.6 \\mbox{[systematic ] } \\times 10^{-12}$ ] photons @xmath20 s@xmath21 at energies @xmath22 tev .",
    "the fluxes from these three detections are shown in figures  [ fig : broadband ] and [ fig : vary ] where we have increased the observational error bars on the radio and tev points by a factor of two ( light - weight bars ) to compensate for uncertainties in the relative emission volumes .",
    "in particular , the increased radio error bar will accommodate the possibility that arc 2 is not associated with the snr shell and thus none of our results will change if this is the case .",
    "collisionless shocks are known to accelerate particles efficiently . in the heliosphere , where shocks are observed directly with spacecraft",
    ", there is clear evidence that the quasi - parallel earth bow shock ( with a sonic mach number , @xmath23 ) can place 10 - 30% of the solar wind kinetic energy flux into superthermal particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interplanetary shocks ( ipss ) also accelerate ambient particles but generally with lower efficiencies due to their lower mach numbers ( generally @xmath24 for ipss ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , on at least two occasions , exceptionally strong ipss have been observed to accelerate particles with high efficiency @xcite .",
    "hybrid plasma simulations showing direct injection and acceleration of ambient particles are consistent with these observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as are convection - diffusion models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "compared to shocks in the heliosphere , it might be presumed that the strong forward and reverse shocks in young snrs are much more efficient . as far as we can tell",
    ", there are no important differences in typical plasma parameters ( i.e. ,  density , magnetic field , temperature , composition ) between the solar wind and the ambient ism .",
    "the only real differences come from the much larger shock spatial and time scales and much higher flow speeds and mach numbers in snrs . in general",
    ", these factors should increase the acceleration efficiency substantially over heliospheric shocks , but some qualifications must be made .    at quasi - parallel shocks",
    "( those where the upstream magnetic field makes an angle , @xmath25 , of less than about @xmath26 with the shock normal ) , injection from the shocked heated plasma should occur easily and the fraction of incoming ram kinetic energy flux going into superthermal particles increases with mach number and shock size and/or age ( as measured in particle gyroradii or gyroperiods ) .",
    "if however , the fraction of shocked heated particles injected is small enough , high mach number , test - particle solutions can result ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in quasi - perpendicular shocks ( ones",
    "where @xmath27 ) , injection and acceleration of shock heated thermal particles is suppressed above some mach number unless strong turbulence is present ( see * ? ? ? * for example ) .",
    "highly oblique interplanetary shocks are observed to accelerate the ambient solar wind ( even without pickup ions , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these are low mach number shocks . as the mach number increases , injection becomes more likely if the turbulence is strong enough for cross - field diffusion in the downstream plasma to be important .    while the shock obliquity will surely vary around a snr and some portions of the shocks",
    "may be quasi - perpendicular with low injection rates , other regions should be parallel enough for efficient injection and acceleration to occur .",
    "radio emission is a sure sign that relativistic electrons are present and flux levels , sharp radio edges , etc .",
    ", show that these particles are locally accelerated in young snrs rather than just compressed galactic cosmic - ray electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the shock acceleration and evolutionary models we use here ignore effects from oblique magnetic fields , other than those that are mimicked by a low injection efficiency .",
    "we do assume , however , that the magnetic field responsible for synchrotron  radiation can be compressed by the shock .",
    "for a recent discussion of how the injection efficiency may vary with @xmath25 in snrs , see @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear effects in efficient shock acceleration are of three basic kinds : ( i ) the self - generation of magnetic turbulence by accelerated particles , ( ii ) the modification ( i.e. ,  smoothing ) of the shock structure by the backpressure of accelerated particles , and ( iii ) the increase in shock compression ratio as relativistic particles are produced and some high - energy particles escape from the system .",
    "briefly , ( i ) occurs when counter - streaming accelerated particles produce turbulence in the upstream magnetic field which amplifies as it is convected through the shock .",
    "this amplified turbulence results in stronger scattering of the particles , and hence to more acceleration , quickly leading to saturated magnetic turbulence levels near @xmath28 in strong shocks .",
    "this is the so - called bohm limit where the mean free path is of the order of the gyroradius , and in this limit , the distinction between parallel and oblique shocks blurs .",
    "the wave - particle interactions produce heating in the shock precursor which may be observable and which lowers the overall acceleration efficiency . effect ( ii ) occurs because the accelerated population presses on the upstream plasma and slows it .",
    "an upstream precursor forms , in which the flow speed ( in the shock frame and in the absence of instabilities ) is monotonically decreasing . since particle diffusion lengths are increasing functions of momentum , high momentum particles sample a broader portion of the flow velocity profile , and hence experience larger effective compression ratios than low momentum particles . consequently , higher momentum particles have a flatter power - law index than those at lower momenta ( producing a concave upward spectral curvature ) and can dominate the pressure in a non - linear fashion .",
    "we call the ratio of densities spanning the entire upstream precursor the overall compression ratio , @xmath29 , to distinguish it from the small scale subshock compression ratio , @xmath30 , where most of the shock heating occurs . for a more complete discussion of the nonlinear effects of diffusive shock acceleration , see @xcite .",
    "the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy fluxes , i.e. , the rankine - hugoniotrelations , yield the standard expression for the compression ratio in shocks where the magnetic field is not dynamically important and an insignificant fraction of energy is placed in superthermal particles ( i.e. , test - particle shocks ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sonic mach number , @xmath0 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath33 is the unshocked density , @xmath34 the unshocked pressure , and @xmath35 is the shock speed . in test - particle shocks , @xmath36 .",
    "the ratio of shocked to unshocked pressure follows : @xmath37 if @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for a electron - proton plasma where the downstream temperatures are equal , the post - shock proton temperature in this test - particle limit , @xmath41 , is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath44 is the proton mass .",
    "young snr shocks are expected to have high mach numbers and if the test - particle situation is assumed with @xmath45 , we expect @xmath46 .",
    "however , when shocks accelerate particles the overall compression ratio increases above test - particle values ( even in non - radiative shocks ) for two reasons ( effect iii above ) .",
    "first , as relativistic particles are produced and contribute significantly to the total pressure , their softer equation of state makes the shocked plasma more compressible ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "second , and most important , is that particles escape from strong shocks draining energy flux which must be compensated for by ramping up the overall compression ratio to conserve the fluxes .",
    "just as in radiative shocks , this is equivalent to @xmath48 .",
    "for strong injection , it can be shown @xcite that @xmath29 is an ever increasing function of mach number , i.e.,@xmath49 where @xmath50 is the alfvn  mach number ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simultaneously with @xmath29 increasing , the subshock compression ratio , @xmath30 , which is mainly responsible for heating the gas , must drop below the test - particle value .",
    "thus , high compression ratios are accompanied by low post - shock temperatures ( in efficient shocks , the post - shock proton temperature can easily be @xmath51 ) .",
    "if injection is weak enough , however , equation  ( [ eq : machsonic ] ) does not apply and high mach number shocks do not accelerate enough particles to cause the total compression ratio to increase above @xmath52 ( see * ? ? ? * for the parameters describing this condition ) .",
    "the most important parameters associated with nonlinear shock acceleration are the mach numbers ( i.e. ,  the shock speed , @xmath35 , pre - shock hydrogen number density , and preshock magnetic field , @xmath53 ) , the injection efficiency , @xmath54 ( i.e. ,  the fraction of total protons which end up with superthermal energies ) , and the maximum proton energy produced , @xmath55 .",
    "as described in @xcite , our model includes alfvn  heating in the precursor which reduces the efficiency compared to adiabatic heating .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a discussion of our treatment of electron injection and acceleration .",
    "@xcite suggest that the forward shock of g347.3@xmath40.5is still within the pre - sn stellar wind bubble with part of it interacting with denser material .",
    "we describe this evolution with a spherically symmetric , wind - shell model with a pre - sn density distribution as shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : presn ] .",
    "the initial density profile in the ejecta has a power law distribution , @xmath56 , with a constant density plateau at small radii , as described in @xcite .",
    "since we only consider the forward shock at fairly late stages in the snr evolution , our results are insensitive to @xmath57 and the position of the plateau .",
    "they are also insensitive to whether a power - law or exponential ejecta mass density distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is assumed . for concreteness , we use @xmath58 in all of our models . as in @xcite , the density of the pre - sn wind",
    "is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the pre - sn mass loss rate , and @xmath62 is the constant wind speed . at some distance from the explosion ,",
    "we place a shell of uniform density , @xmath63  our spherically symmetric representation of the density enhancement suggested by @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath64 is the number fraction of helium and @xmath65 is the proton number density in the shell .",
    "while the radio image of g347.3@xmath40.5  suggests a shell with the strongest emission coming from the nw rim , the complex morphology makes an exact determination of the diameter somewhat ambiguous .",
    "some radio and x - ray emission extends across @xmath66 , but a smaller @xmath67 diameter ring - like structure is also present . as a compromise , we adopt an angular diameter of @xmath68 , and to further limit parameters , we perform all of our fits assuming a distance of @xmath69 kpc @xcite . with these assumptions ,",
    "the outer shock is at a radius @xmath70 pc and we take ( somewhat arbitrarily ) the inner radius of the shell to be @xmath71 pc , giving a shell thickness approximately equal to the thickness of radio arc 1 , i.e. ,  @xmath72 .",
    "fortunately , none of our conclusions depend critically on these particular values .",
    "furthermore , as long as @xmath73 , our results are insensitive to @xmath74 and we use @xmath75 gm cm@xmath21 which is consistent with a wind extending to 34 pc .",
    "@xmath77 yr@xmath21 and @xmath78",
    "km s@xmath21  ( giving @xmath75 gm cm@xmath21 ) , @xmath79 would exist in a spherical wind extending to 34 pc . with this @xmath80",
    ", the wind bubble would have taken @xmath81 yr to form and could still not have stagnated in a low density interstellar medium . ]",
    "the evolution is calculated with the virginia hydrodynamics ( vh-1 ) time - dependent hydrodynamic numerical code in one dimension where it is implicitly assumed that dynamic effects from magnetic fields are negligible . for a description of this code ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein . with the shock speed and other parameters obtained with the hydro code ,",
    "we calculate the electron , proton , and helium spectra and with them the synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , inverse - compton , and pion - decay  photon continuum spectra .",
    "we then compare the photon emission to the observations and vary parameters until a satisfactory fit is obtained .      of necessity ,",
    "our model is approximate in some important ways .",
    "first , we assume the snr is spherically symmetric when , in fact , the emission is strongest from one section of the rim where the shock is likely interacting with denser material .",
    "we compensate for this at the most basic level by defining the emission volume , @xmath82 , as a fraction , @xmath83 , of the shell volume encompassed by the forward shock , i.e.,@xmath84 from figure  [ fig : g347image ] we estimate that @xmath85 .",
    "second , we use a one - zone model where the particle spectra and photon emission are assumed to be generated by a shock of constant speed during the time the forward shock is in the shell . we ignore any evolution of the spectra or the shock during the time the shock is in the shell and the shock speed used for acceleration is the average speed in the shell as determined by the hydro code .",
    "furthermore , we neglect any contributions from the reverse shock or reflected shocks which occur when the forward shock enters the shell",
    ". these should be excellent approximations since the forward shock speed does nt vary greatly while in the shell ( middle panel figure  [ fig : presn ] ) , particles produced earlier in the low density wind or ejecta have been reduced by adiabatic losses , and reflected shocks in the shell are weak compared to the forward shock .",
    "the evolution of the snr will be influenced by the acceleration process through the increased compression ratios of the forward and reverse shocks and by the escape of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "we have approximated this effect by performing our hydrodynamic calculations with values of the effective ratio of specific heats , @xmath86 , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the effect on the forward shock speed is shown for typical parameters in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : presn ] .",
    "the solid curve is for @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , the dashed curve is for @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , and the dotted curve is for @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "when @xmath87 , the shock reaches 40 pc after @xmath93 yr , for @xmath94 , it reaches 40 pc after @xmath95 yr , and for @xmath91 , 40 pc is reached after @xmath96 yr . while globally changing @xmath97 only approximates the effects of particle acceleration on the evolution ( particle escape is not explicitly included and the evolution of @xmath97 is not modeled , for example ) , we do not believe errors from this approximation are significant since all of the models we discuss below have compression ratios less than @xmath98 when the forward shock is in the shell .",
    "as indicated in figure  [ fig : presn ] , at @xmath99 pc @xmath35 varies by less than 25% for @xmath100 . despite this small change in @xmath35 ,",
    "the particle spectra produced by a shock with @xmath101 are still strongly nonlinear and differs importantly from test - particle spectra as shown in the fits below .",
    "finally , our model ignores x - ray _ line _ emission which , for a thermal plasma , can be much more intense than the pure bremsstrahlung component .",
    "for example , the 0.210 kev flux for a @xmath102 kev raymond - smith model @xcite is @xmath103 times higher than for a thermal bremsstrahlung model with the same temperature and emission measure .",
    "this discrepancy decreases with temperature , dropping to @xmath52 at @xmath104 kev and @xmath105 at @xmath106 kev .",
    "if the featureless x - ray spectrum in g347.3@xmath40.5  is synchrotron  emission , the underlying bremsstrahlungcontinuum which we calculate must be low enough so lines , had they been calculated , would not appear .",
    "= 0    most of the parameters used in our models are described in @xcite and/or shown here in table  [ table-1 ] .",
    "briefly : by 1  the explosion energy , @xmath107 , largely determines the overall dynamics and is typically assumed to be near @xmath108 erg .",
    "the ejecta mass , @xmath109 , is unimportant for the ages and parameters we consider as long as it is less than about 3 @xmath77 .",

    "this conclusion depends , of course , on @xmath118 and could be weakened by assuming @xmath201 . however , the relative acceleration efficiency of electrons and protons is also likely to scale as @xmath118 @xcite making it difficult to produce the observed radio and tev flux if @xmath118 is too small .",
    "furthermore , if a flatter synchrotron  slope is required to give a better match between the radio and x - rays ( as in model @xmath169 ) , this forces the shock to be more efficient ( to produce a larger @xmath29 ) and implies a larger @xmath54 . the overall flux , the lack of x - ray emission lines , and the radio to x - ray flux ratio all point toward efficient shock acceleration .",

    "we find @xmath203 for @xmath204 , yielding a lower limit @xmath205 , i.e. , even with @xmath199 erg , the shock must place at least 25% of its kinetic energy flux in relativistic particles .",
    "note that we took @xmath206 for this example .",
    "a lower @xmath120 would imply a higher acceleration efficiency .    in order to investigate the maximum proton energies that g347.3@xmath40.5  can generate , we have produced model @xmath207 ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : broadband ] ) where we have chosen parameters ( including taking @xmath112 ) with the intention of maximizing @xmath55 .",
    "very generally , diffusive shock acceleration yields the same maximum energy per _ charge _ for all particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , so the only way the proton and electron spectra can have different maximum energies is for losses ( synchrotron  and/or inverse - compton ) to be important for the electrons . unless we have neglected an abundant supply of photons in addition to the 2.73  k background radiation , inverse - compton losses are not important and only when the magnetic field is large can @xmath55 be much greater than @xmath148 .",
    "however , a large field produces a lower alfvn  mach number which weakens the acceleration and , in order to fit the broad - band spectrum , a higher shock speed is required .",
    "this can be achieved with a larger @xmath107 and/or a lower @xmath65 , and we have taken @xmath208 erg and @xmath209 @xmath131  for model @xmath207 . the observed radio flux sets the strength of the magnetic field in the emission region combined with the relativistic electron density , i.e. , the flux is loosely proportional or the density produces changes in the acceleration model and/or the snr evolution .",

    "furthermore , if g347.3 - 0.5 continues to evolve uniformly with no magnetic field amplification , it will not produce higher energy particles as it ages ( for a more complete discussion of the time particles take to obtain their maximum energies , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the causes of magnetic field amplification are still uncertain , it remains possible that higher fields and therefore higher energy particles could be produced in the future .",

    "g347.3 - 0.5 is one of a growing number of shell - type snrs showing nonthermal x - rays believed produced by synchrotron  emission from tev electrons accelerated by the remnant shocks . in an attempt to have a consistent , broad - band spectrum , we have combined recent x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray observations of the remnant with new radio observations and have restricted all of the observations to the bright northwest rim of the shell . comparing a spherically symmetric , wind - shell model of snr evolution and efficient diffusive shock acceleration against the observations shows that the observed emission can be well fit across @xmath218 decades in energy with a single set of parameters all close to expected supernova and ism values .",
    "the densities we find for the emission region ( @xmath219 protons @xmath131 ) are consistent with the upper limits found earlier by @xcite , and are below those expected for either a molecular cloud or a swept - up shell produced as the pre - sn wind interacts with the interstellar medium ( or with a slower red supergiant wind ) .",
    "this suggests the shock is still within the low density bubble but has encountered a density enhancement perhaps caused by perturbations in the pre - sn wind .",
    "we put limits on the acceleration efficiency and find that g347.3@xmath40.5  is currently putting at least @xmath220% ( and more likely @xmath221% ) of the forward shock ram energy flux into relativistic particles ( i.e.,cosmic rays ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have inferred efficient shock acceleration in snr e0102.2 - 7219 in the small magellanic cloud from the shock speed , determined from expansion measurements , and the postshock electron temperature , determined from x - ray line models ( unlike g347.3@xmath40.5 , lines are visible above the synchrotron  continuum in the post - forward shock gas ) .",
    "they concluded that the extremely low postshock temperature can only be reconciled with the high shock speed if a sizable fraction ( @xmath221% ) of the shock energy goes into cosmic rays .",
    "our results are fully consistent with this and with the important point that efficient particle acceleration causes a strong coupling between the broad - band emission from relativistic particles and the properties of the shocked heated x - ray emitting gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we have verified that sedov models ( not shown ) with no density enhancement produce satisfactory nonlinear fits to the observed spectral shape with input parameters similar to those given here , but are inconsistent with the observed remnant diameter and distance .",
    "( or even @xmath222 ) at @xmath223 kpc . only if @xmath224 kpc could standard models produce acceptable fits .",
    "the wind - shell model allows the shock to propagate for large distances in the low density wind before encountering the higher density emission region .",
    "] we conclude that the nonlinear aspects we infer , in particular the required high acceleration efficiency , do not depend significantly on the geometric details of the wind - shell model while the overall normalization does .",
    "furthermore , we find that the maximum energies of the cosmic - ray electrons and protons are well below @xmath225 ev . while it has been known for some time that snrs emitting nonthermal x - rays do not produce _ electrons _ to energies near @xmath225 ev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the nonlinear effects we model make it possible to infer the proton distribution from photons emitted by electrons . for no magnetic field compression in the shock and other parameters adjusted to produce the highest possible @xmath55 and still give a reasonable fit to the observations , we find a proton maximum energy @xmath226 tev .",
    "more realistic parameters with magnetic field compression yield @xmath227 tev . however , snr shocks will also accelerate heavier ion species such as he , c , o , and fe , and the maximum energy in diffusive shock acceleration scales as charge .",

    "the normalization is determined by the cosmic abundance of iron ( @xmath228 iron nuclei for every proton ) plus the enhancement expected because iron is injected and initially accelerated when it is trapped in dust grains .",
    "in fact , the normalization of iron relative to hydrogen in figure  [ fig : spectra ] is just that shown in figure  8 of @xcite at @xmath229 kev / nucleon .",
