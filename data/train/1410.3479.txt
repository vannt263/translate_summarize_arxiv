    "for decades , galaxy merging has been a popular explanation for the observed evolution in galaxy properties .",
    "galaxy mergers were first invoked to explain the morphological transformation of galaxies @xcite .",
    "merging remains the backbone in cosmological simulations in building up large galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gas - rich major mergers at high redshifts ( @xmath10 ) are thought to trigger starburst and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) episodes , quench star formation , and lead to bulge formation , thereby building the massive ellipticals in the local universe @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario has been proposed more recently , in which massive galaxies at high redshift are clumpy disks which are very efficient in turning incoming cold gas into stars @xcite .",
    "the most luminous agns and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) take place in major galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "merging galaxies have enhanced star formation activity compared to isolated ones ( @xcite ; but also see @xcite ) . as galaxy merging may have profound influence on how the galaxy population evolved to this day ,",
    "quantifying its rate of occurrence is essential to judge whether it explains any of the observed evolutionary trends .    as the timescale for galaxy mergers is on the order of a gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the conventional way to measure galaxy merger rate is to divide the observed fraction of galaxies undergoing mergers by a typical merging ( observability ) timescale at different redshift bins .",
    "merging galaxies can be identified as close galaxy pairs or galaxies displaying disturbed morphologies , and the timescale required to convert the merger fraction to merger rate depends on the specific selection technique . in this work",
    "we use the pair selection method , as the merger fraction measured from morphological selection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the merging observability timescale are dependent on the imaging depth and resolution . the advent of multi - wavelength blank field observations in the past decade have enabled many improvements in the measurement of merger fractions , including the following : ( 1 ) the merger fraction of massive galaxies can be measured beyond @xmath12 ; ( 2 ) the photometric redshifts allow more accurate removal of the pairs projected along the line - of - sight ; ( 3 ) the stellar masses derived from the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting provide the stellar mass ratio of galaxy pairs , which is a more physically meaningful proxy for the dynamical interaction than a single - band flux ratio ; ( 4 ) deeper and wider area surveys provide larger samples , which in turn allow the dependence of merger fractions on different parameters to be explored .",
    "multiple authors have measured the merger fraction at @xmath13 , presenting somewhat conflicting results : does the merger fraction increase with redshift @xcite , remain constant , or even diminish @xcite ? as shown in @xcite , the variation of the parent galaxy selection and and mass ratio limits can contribute to some of the discrepancies across studies .",
    "on the other hand , the average merging observability timescale is hard to estimate due to the large possible variety of orbital parameters and viewing angles , as well as the lack of observed dynamical information on a galaxy - to - galaxy basis .",
    "the uncertainties in the implied merger rates are discussed thoroughly in @xcite .    in this work , we present the largest sample of photometrically selected mergers at @xmath14=0.1 - 3 to date from stellar mass complete catalogs",

    "we discuss the two main sources of uncertainties in the merger fraction measurements .",
    "we show that we are complete to detecting minor mergers up to @xmath15 .",
    "finally we convert the merger fractions to merger rates , and infer the merger contribution in the stellar mass , size , velocity dispersion and number density evolution of massive galaxies . based on our findings ,",
    "we address some broader questions in the context of galaxy evolution in section  [ sec : discussion ] : what do the merger rates imply for the evolution of massive quiescent galaxies ? is merging an influential process in the cosmic star formation history or not ? we also discuss the future prospects of merger fraction studies .",

    "the line - of - sight projected galaxy pairs can be corrected for using redshift measurements ( photometric or spectroscopic ) or statistical arguments based on the galaxy mass or luminosity function . in this work",
    "we apply a photo-@xmath14 criterion as listed in section  [ sec : select_pairs ] to correct for projected pairs ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated in @xcite that using the photo-@xmath14 s to correct for chance alignments yield results consistent with statistical corrections at @xmath47 .    in this work",
    "we do not correct for physical galaxy pairs at matching redshifts that are not energetically bound to merge , i.e. we assume @xmath48 = 0 .",
    "cosmological simulations can provide a statistical estimate of @xmath48 to account for the unbound galaxy pairs in cluster environments with high relative velocities .",
    "however , the interpretation may be complicated by the presence of a third neighbor which is not uncommon @xcite , or these pairs simply require more time before the eventual coalescence @xcite . galaxy fly - bys may be frequent @xcite but it remains unexplored how high - speed encounters may impact the mass distribution and light profiles of galaxies .",
    "even if the cores do not coalesce , mass from the satellite may still be deposited onto the host galaxy , and the energy exchange can lead to size growth akin to a `` real '' merger @xcite .",
    "it is not well understood how @xmath48 evolves with the environment and redshift . at higher redshift",
    ", massive galaxies are expected to be less clustered than at the present day , so the effect is likely more dominant at low redshift .",
    "future studies of the dynamical properties of galaxy pairs at different redshifts and environments may provide new insights into this effect , but for now we do not have enough information to correct for it .",
    "we note that by including non - energetically bound pairs in our selection , the merger fractions derived in this paper are formally upper limits .",
    "hereafter we refer to @xmath44 as @xmath49 for simplicity .",
    "we define the merger fraction as the fraction of massive galaxies that are merging with a less massive companion , i.e. @xmath50 . the major and minor merger fractions ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) in redshift bins are listed on table  [ table : pf_massratio ] and plotted on figure  [ fig : pf_massratio ] ( left ) .",
    "we parameterise the merger fractions within the completeness limits by a power law using least squares fitting . in the case of @xmath51 declining beyond @xmath38 in ultravista , the reduced @xmath53 value for the power law fit exceeds 10 indicating a bad fit so we fit the data points with a quadratic function instead .",
    "we list the best fitting parameters in table  [ table : bestfit ] .    using the stellar mass ratio selection",
    ", we find that @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) increases from @xmath54 to reach a peak at @xmath55 , remains relatively constant to @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) and then diminishes towards higher redshift .",
    "a comparison between the merger fractions derived from the ground - based ultravista and the deeper , higher resolution 3dhst+candels reveals very similar @xmath51 and @xmath52 in both samples .",
    "in fact , @xmath51 is slightly lower in 3dhst+candels than in ultravista at @xmath58 .",
    "if we include the pairs without photo-@xmath14 information ( columns 3 and 7 on table  [ table : pf_massratio ] ) in our merger sample , the @xmath51 of 3dhst+candels at this redshift bin becomes consistent with the one from ultravista .",
    "this illustrates that space - based data is not required for measuring the galaxy merger fraction .",
    "in fact , ground - based data with a large survey volume such as ultravista provides the optimal dataset , as the sample is adequately large to measure the redshift dependence of the merger fractions in finer redshift bins .",

    "the remaining pairs consist of minor _ stellar mass _ ratio ( @xmath166 ) and mostly very minor _ stellar mass _ ratio ( @xmath167 ) with @xmath16810:1 .",

    "we conclude that the flux ratio selection yields a higher merger fraction than mass ratio selection at all redshifts for two reasons : ( 1 ) the observed @xmath7-band probes bluer rest - frame bands at higher @xmath14 ; ( 2 ) lower @xmath169 satellites enter the sample @xcite , where @xmath169 is the ratio of the stellar mass to the rest - frame @xmath170-band luminosity .",
    "we illustrate the redshift dependence of @xmath169 in figure  [ fig : mtol_z ] .",
    "there is overall @xmath169 redshift evolution in both the massive galaxies and their satellites , in which the ratio increases over cosmic time .",

    "our simulations in appendix  [ sec : sb_limit ] indicate that we are complete to @xmath173 for major ( minor ) mergers in 3dhst+candels , therefore the @xmath169 evolution can not be explained by observational effects and is intrinsic .",
    "the @xmath169 evolution reflects the higher star formation activity at @xmath174 compared to that of the present day ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "having shown that the use of the flux and stellar mass ratio can reproduce the discrepancy in merger fraction in literature , we proceed to find the ratio that best describes the dynamics and future evolution of the merging galaxies .",
    "although using the @xmath7-band flux ratio selection is biased towards star - forming but low stellar mass satellites , the use of the stellar mass ratio may be biased against gas - rich satellites at @xmath13 .",
    "galaxies appear to be more gas - rich at higher redshift and at lower masses @xcite .",
    "such a dependence implies that the baryon mass ratio is closer to unity than the stellar mass ratio , since cold gas mass is included into the baryon mass calculation .",
    "the baryon mass of a galaxy is a better probe of its total mass ( which also includes dark matter ) than the stellar mass alone , as shown in cosmological simulations @xcite .",

    ".    the apparent strong size evolution may be in part due to observational effects .",
    "our observations indicate that massive galaxies tend to merge with galaxies with lower stellar mass - to - light ratios ( see figure  [ fig : mtol_z ] and section  [ sec : pf_ratios ] ) . if the younger , bluer stars of the companion are added to the outskirts of massive galaxies consisting of older stellar populations @xcite , then the half - light radius ( @xmath347 ) measured in rest - frame optical bands increases .",

    "@xcite show that the half - mass radii of massive qgs are on average @xmath348 smaller than the half - light radii measured from the rest - frame @xmath349-band .",
    "therefore the observed size evolution is perhaps in part due to the radial dependence of the @xmath350 .",
    "since the number- and mass - weighted average stellar mass ratio is @xmath2 4:1 for the mergers in this work , the satellites may strip off their stars at the outskirts like the 5:1 intermediate mass ratio merger simulated by @xcite , lending support to merging as a viable explanation for the observed size evolution and color gradients .",
    "it is important to distinguish between the growth of individual galaxies and the evolution of the overall population .",
    "the number density of the massive qgs evolves with redshift , for instance massive ( @xmath298 ) galaxies are 30 times more abundant at @xmath351 than @xmath352 ( e.g. @xcite and references therein , also see section  [ sec : numdens_evolution ] ) .",
    "therefore if larger , later quenched galaxies are continuously added to the qg population , it may be sufficient to increase the average sizes of qgs ( more details about the so - called `` progenitor bias '' in @xcite ) .",
    "this assumes that the sizes of qgs are correlated with their age or time since being quenched , a trend which is observed in some works @xcite but not in others @xcite .",
    "another implication is that the scatter of the size evolution is expected to increase if the progenitor bias is the sole explanation for the observed size evolution , which contradicts the constant scatter observed @xcite .",
    "additionally , the progenitor bias alone does not explain the disappearance of compact qgs observed at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the number density of compact qgs peaks at @xmath353 and decreases towards lower and higher redshifts .",
    "our merger fractions ( stellar mass ratio selected ) peak at @xmath354 , and one may speculate on a causal relation between the two observations .    a fixed number density selection may provide a more direct comparison between massive qgs at @xmath174 and their descendants at lower redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the descendants of compact massive qgs at @xmath355 are the most compact qgs in clusters in the local universe , the sizes of individual qgs will only need to increase by a factor of @xmath356 @xcite , which is in good agreement with the size evolution inferred from our merger rates .",
    "apart from the observational effects and the progenitor bias discussed above , alternative means to increase the sizes of individual qgs have been proposed .",

    "it is beyond the scope of this work to draw conclusions on the relative contributions of the possible options in explaining the size evolution .",
    "we emphasise that our results provide a strong constraint : whichever mechanisms are responsible for the observed size evolution , there is little room for further stellar mass to be created or added ( @xmath9 at most for @xmath357 ) for the most massive galaxies ( @xmath358 ) in order not to over - produce the observed numbers at different redshifts .      the open question of whether merging is a major contributor to the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) has been tackled in different ways : do merging galaxies have higher star formation rates compared to isolated ones @xcite ? at each epoch , are star - forming galaxies primarily mergers or isolated disks @xcite ? these different perspectives can lead to seemingly contradictory conclusions .    despite the apparent offset of visually identified mergers from the sfr-@xmath359 relation ( dubbed  main - sequence , @xcite ) , merging galaxies only show disturbed morphologies for a limited time ( @xmath360 gyr , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "while mergers _ can _ destroy disks and remain a popular explanation for bulge formation @xcite , various works have shown that disks can reform after gas - rich mergers @xcite .    even though galaxy merging may not increase the total amount of stars formed from the available cold gas reservoir , it can trigger starburst episodes by temporarily enhancing the star formation efficiency , leading to faster cold gas depletion @xcite .",

    "as long as the lower limit of @xmath35 is set so that no close pairs are missed due to blending , and the relevant observability timescales are applied for the @xmath35 range @xcite , deep ground - based nir surveys like ultravista and uds provide as accurate results as _ hst _ surveys .",
    "ground - based surveys have the additional advantage of larger sample sizes , so that the evolution can be probed in finer redshift bins with small poisson uncertainties .",
    "put another way , large area surveys are crucial to mitigate cosmic variance and poisson uncertainties in galaxy merger fraction measurements .",
