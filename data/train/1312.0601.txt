    "in this article we present a mechanism to generate baryons from an embedded metastable cosmic string . to estimate the baryon production we compute the production of skyrmions by the string ( see e.g. @xcite for overviews on cosmic strings ) .",
    "skyrmions are global textures and are characterized by the non trivial third homotopy group of the vacuum manifold .",
    "an important characteristic of skyrmions is that their field configuration takes on the vev everywhere and thus skyrmions only have gradient energy @xcite.this is for example not the case for strings which have a restored symmetry in their core .",
    "interestingly , skyrmions can also describe baryons in the context of the the skyrme model : solitons in the linear sigma model can be interpreted as the baryons of qcd@xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible to compute the baryons productions from a pion string by computing the instanton production .    in the following",
    "we study the decay of the false vacuum into the true ground state for a small region of the metastable string and compute the production of skyrmions .",
    "we consider the process in which a segment of the string decays into skyrmion - anti - skyrmion pairs .",
    "we calculate the decay rate for this process in order to quantify the production of skyrmions that can then be interpreted as baryons . as a result , the metastable string , besides having standard cosmological impact ( see for e.g @xcite ) could also contribute to baryon density fluctuations through skyrmion production by the string network .",
    "we consider a certain type of metastable string and focus on field - theoretic strings coupled to a thermal bath of photons in models analogous to the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to compute the skyrmions production rate for metastable strings previously stabilized by a photon plasma @xcite@xcite .",
    "more precisely , we consider an embedded string made of two non - thermal complex scalar fields : one is neutral @xmath0 and the other one is charged @xmath1 . since charged fields are naturally coupled to photon gauge fields , a thermal bath of photons can easily be implemented in such cases .",
    "we consider a temperature below a certain critical temperature where the scalar fields are still out - of - equilibrium .",
    "in our approach we focus on first order phase transitions .",
    "such transitions usually imply a period of non - equilibrium physics and typicallyoccur via bubble nucleation .",
    "the result of threose bubbles nucleations is the melting of the string and , as we will show , possible formation of skyrmions when two instantons meet .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce our embedded metastable string and the linear sigma model of qcd .",
    "we recall results of bubble nucleation in this context . in section iii",
    ", we describe the string decay through meson production . in section iv",
    ", we describe the physical picture of the string decay by baryon ( skyrmion ) production . in section",
    "v , we provide estimate of the number of produced skyrmions per unit length per hubble time . here",
    "we also discuss the production of baryons by a dense string network by noting its similarity with skyrmion production in a phase transition .",
    "section vi presents conclusions .",
    "our toy model for the metastable string is similar to the pion string well described by the linear sigma model in the low energy qcd regime .",
    "previously , some of us found the effective potential at temperature t for out of equilibrium fields in contact with a photon plasma . this plasma stabilizes the pion string which is topologically unstable , and makes the string metastable for a certain range of parameters such that @xmath2@xcite . in this case",
    "the model is analogous to the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity .      as a toy model for the analytical study of the stabilization of embedded defects by plasma effects we consider the chiral limit of the qcd linear sigma model , involving the sigma field @xmath3 and the pion triplet @xmath4 , given by the lagrangian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the ground state expectation value of @xmath7 . in the following ,",
    "we denote the potential in ( [ lag1 ] ) by @xmath8 .",
    "two of the scalar fields , the @xmath3 and @xmath9 , are electrically neutral , the other two are charged . introducing the coupling to electromagnetism ( through covariant derivatives )",
    "it is convenient to write the scalar field sector @xmath10 of the resulting lagrangian in terms of the complex scalar fields @xmath11 according to the minimal coupling prescription we obtain @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "effective pion - photon interactions appear through the covariant derivative in ( [ lag2 ] ) .",
    "suppose we have standard @xmath14 vacuum manifold .",
    "then the first homotopy group is trivial and thus there are no topologically stable string defects .",
    "note that if we restrict the field configuration to have @xmath15 , then the u(1 ) of electromagnetism gets broken and there is a magnetic flux of @xmath16 in the core of the string .    considering a specific configuration where @xmath17 and @xmath18 the vacuum manifold @xmath19 reduces to @xmath20 and",
    "string configurations exist but are not topologically stable since @xmath21 .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , using plasma effect and considering temperature below the confinement scale , we have an embedded neutral string as usual , @xmath22 vanishes in the core of the string , but in addition the two charged fields vanish everywhere .",
    "however this configuration is now metastable and the charged fields can take on non zero value only after quantum tunneling .    for simplicity we work with 2 complex scalar fields ,",
    "one charged that we call @xmath23 and one uncharged , @xmath24 .    considering a thermal bath and two non - equilibrium charged fields",
    "gives rise to a new effective potential which at very high - temperatures @xmath25 yields @xcite    v_eff(,_c , t ) ( ||^2+|_c|^2-^2)^2+t^2-t [ veff ]        this potential ( [ veff ] ) is the starting point of our analysis .",
    "there is a 1st order phase transition due to the negative cubic term : this is why the potential has metastable vacuum .    as show in fig.[tun ] , for this potential , above certain temperature @xmath26 , the vacuum manifold forms a circle in phase space : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , such a system admits string solutions : in our case , at temperature below the confinement scale , an embedded neutral string exists . above the critical temperature , @xmath26",
    ", the potential barrier is infinite in the charged pions direction and no tunneling occurs . for temperatures between @xmath29 and @xmath26 , @xmath28 ,",
    "is the true vev so that the pion string is stable and no skyrmions are generated .",
    "however , for temperatures between @xmath30 and the critical temperature @xmath31 , the system exhibits a 1st order phase transition due to the negative cubic term in the potential . as a result ,",
    "the zero charged pion condensate becomes metastable : @xmath32 is in the false vacuum and quantum tunneling can occur . in the following we consider temperatures below @xmath29 .    after tunneling",
    "the charged fields take on a non - vanishing expectation value in the true ground state : @xmath33 where @xmath34is the true vev .",
    "the quantum tunneling can happen anywhere on the string , resulting in the nucleation of bubbles at various nucleation points on the string .",
    "after tunneling in the core of the string , the charged field takes on a non zero value inside each bubble nucleated : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the vev for the potential localized in the core of the neutral string ( so that the neutral fields vanish ) . since there are two charged fields @xmath33 describes a circle of radius @xmath34 .",
    "the bubbles corresponds to instantons which have a non trivial topology in the four scalar fields direction .",
    "after tunneling , the bubbles expand at almost the speed of light and meet each other to form skyrmions , as we will discuss below .    as a consequence of this tunneling , the core of the neutral string melts and the string generates bubbles at various locations .",
    "it is important to note here that we have a global string here with non - zero gradient energy in the winding everywhere ( up to some cut - off distance , say the inter - string separation ) .",
    "thus the melting of the core alone can not break the string .",
    "the actual process of the decay of portions of the string is discussed later in detail in sections iii and iv .",
    "let us recall some results for bubble nucleation for our specific setting @xcite .",
    "the bubble nucleation rate can be roughly estimated to be @xmath35 where b is the bounce action in euclidean space and @xmath36 is the string background action .    restricting ourselves to the core of the string",
    ", the string background action @xmath36 is assumed to vanish .",
    "first , using the thin wall approximation we obtain the o(4 ) symmetric action in euclidean spacetime s_sphere&=^2 r^3 d r [ ( ) ^2 + v(_c ) ] + & = - r^4 v + 2 ^ 2 r^3 s_1 where r is the radius of the bubble in euclidean space and the potential energy density difference between the two minima is @xmath37 .",
    "the temperature dependent radius of the nucleated bubble is r(t)= = [ r ] where the thin - wall parameter @xmath38 is a dimensionless quantity that decreases with temperature [ e2 ] ( t)=-1    the resulting bubble nucleation rate per unit volume is [ dec ] ~p_4 where @xmath39 , the prefactor has mass dimension 4 .",
    "after tunneling , bubbles of 4-radius @xmath40 in the euclidean space are nucleated .",
    "wick rotating back in minkowski space - time we see as show in fig.[b2 ] that these bubbles will try to expand in minkowski space .",
    "as the temperature decreases , the string becomes unstable due to the increase in the bubble nucleation rate .     in minkowski space .",
    "inside the bubble , the charged field is in its true vacuum , @xmath41 , and the neutral field vanishes . ]",
    "we now choose to work in the regime where the decay rate of the metastable string per unit volume is greater than @xmath42 so that the decay of the cosmic string can actually occur in an expanding universe resulting in skyrmion production .",
    "the manner in which the string decays depends on the rate of bubble nucleation , and on the ambient temperature .",
    "we first discuss the case with low bubble nucleation rate , when the string decays primarily by perturbative excitations , via meson production . in the next section",
    "we then discuss the case of non - perturbative excitations , when the string decays into skyrmions and anti - skyrmions .",
    "we have seen above that the u(1 ) winding of the string can be trivialized by a tunneling process .",
    "this is mediated by an instanton which converts a localized region on the string to a topologically trivial mapping on the full vacuum manifold @xmath19 of the sigma model .",
    "it is important to realize that the region outside this localized _ tunneled _ region retains the topologically non - trivial winding on the u(1 ) in the @xmath43 part of the @xmath19 .",
    "thus , this instanton process only destabilizes the core of the string by making it _ swell_. this swelling increases as this topologically trivial region expands .    here",
    "we note that the metastability of the string arises from the @xmath44 term in the effective potential in eq.([veff ] ) .",
    "this term will become ineffective at low temperatures depending on the relevant values of gradient energies etc .",
    "thus the chiral field will start re - orienting away from @xmath43 plane by developing non - zero value of @xmath1 in regions of strong gradient energies , e.g. near the core of the string .",
    "for sufficiently low values of the temperature , the chiral field around the whole string can re - orient and trivialize the u(1 ) winding everywhere .",
    "the entire string configuration will then smoothly evolve to the vacuum configurations with the entire energy of the string converting into meson excitations .",
    "all this will happen without any mediation of any instanton process .",
    "however , if the temperature is not low enough , then this process will remain highly localized near the core of the string , effectively just leading to thickening of the string .",
    "further decay of the string will then proceed by instanton process converting a localized region on the string to roughly uniform orientation of the field . for simplicity , we take this tunneling region to have spherical shape , though our considerations below do not specifically require such geometric details .    in principle , even a single such tunneling region will expand until the whole string is covered by it and its u(1 ) winding is trivialized completely . for a straight string this will mean the tunneling region expanding longitudinally along the string as well as in the transverse direction .",
    "the cutoff scale for this process will then be provided by typical string - antistring separation scale when such expanding regions ( _ swelled cores _ ) of different string will join with the entire region converted to topologically trivial mapping . for a string loop , the size of the loop will provide natural cutoff for this process .    in the case where a single tunneling process completes the decay of the string",
    ", the entire energy of the string ( which is large as we consider a global string ) will primarily go into meson production which correspond to perturbative excitations of the chiral field .",
    "however , some nontrivial structures may arise in between the strings , in a manner described below .",
    "the density of such structures is likely to be insignificant in this case .",
    "now , having explained how mesons arise from the string , we turn to the production of baryons through skyrmion production . in the following we focus on the toplogy of the nucleated instantons and show that when two bubbles meet , partial or integer skyrmions can form .",
    "the string we consider arises here as the variation of the chiral field in space is restricted to the u(1 ) submanifold of the vacuum manifold @xmath19 , spanned by @xmath3 and @xmath9 .",
    "the chiral sigma model allows for genuine topological objects known as skyrmions corresponding to non - trivial windings of compactified space @xmath19 to the vacuum manifold @xmath19 .",
    "these skyrmions are identified with baryons as they carry integer baryon numbers @xcite .    in the last section we discussed the case when the bubble nucleation rate by tunneling is low .",
    "we argued that in that case the string primarily decays into mesons .",
    "however , if the decay rate of this tunneling process ( as given by eq.([dec ] ) ) is large then a very different mechanism for the decay of string may arise .    in the case of a large bubble nucleation rate",
    ", many tunneling regions form on the string .",
    "these regions then expand and join with the neighboring regions .",
    "after joining , these regions keep expanding in the transverse plane as the u(1 ) winding remains non - trivial outside such regions . thus , the whole process of the decay of the string will still terminate only when the transverse expansion of these regions is halted by encountering similar regions from different strings for the straight string case . for the string loop case the process will stop when similar regions from different parts of the same string meet .",
    "more importantly , skyrmions arise from the intersection region of two neighboring tunneling regions either on a given string , or on neighboring strings if we consider a string network .",
    "first we consider the simple case where the entire tunneling region has some roughly constant value of @xmath45 .",
    "this is reasonable to expect as instantons with large field variations in the tunneling region will have large action and hence will be suppressed .",
    "this region will expand and meet a neighboring expanding region .",
    "if this neighboring region also has roughly similar chiral field configuration , with the field pointing roughly in the same direction on @xmath19 , then these two regions will smoothly join and form a larger expanding region .    .",
    "note that @xmath45 varies from 0 ( at the center ) to @xmath46 for the outer most shell which is the boundary of the ball @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the compactification of the ball @xmath47 in the physical space to @xmath19 ]    we take a given tunneling region with spherical shape to correspond to a ball @xmath47 in the physical space .",
    "the chiral field in this region maps into the vacuum manifold @xmath19 .",
    "this entire field configuration can smoothly rotate to a single point on @xmath19 thereby trivializing the u(1 ) winding .",
    "we first show , in fig.[br31 ] , the topologically non - trivial configuration on a ball @xmath47 which corresponds to skyrmion .",
    "the vacuum manifold being @xmath19 , we characterize it by three angles @xmath49 , and @xmath45 . in fig.[br31 ] , the polar angle of the arrows ( in the physical space ) is taken to represent @xmath50 ( on the vacuum manifold ) .",
    "similarly , the azimuthal angle of arrows represents @xmath0 .",
    "we show , by dotted circles , spherical shells , with each spherical shell being characterized by the third angle @xmath45 as needed for representing the three sphere @xmath19 . with this",
    "the winding one configuration on @xmath19 , that is a full skyrmion , will correspond to the variation of @xmath45 from the value 0 at the center , to @xmath46 , for the outermost spherical shell , as shown in fig.[br31 ] ( see ref .",
    "essentially , the ball @xmath47 represents stereographic projection of the vacuum manifold @xmath19 with the north pole of @xmath19 being the center of the ball while the south pole of @xmath19 being mapped to the boundary of @xmath47 ( thereby compactifying @xmath47 to @xmath19 ) .",
    "here we have represented the winding one map from ( compactified ball ) @xmath19 to the vacuum manifold @xmath19 by taking @xmath19 as a suspension of @xmath51 with each @xmath51 in the suspension being labeled by angle @xmath45 between 0 and @xmath52 while each individual @xmath51 is parametrized by angles @xmath50 and @xmath0 .",
    "the three angles @xmath53 are related to the 4 scalar fields in the following way : ^0= cos  and  = sincos + ^1 = sinsincos  and   ^2= sinsinsin    where the charged fields @xmath54 are defined in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 in eq.[pi ] .",
    "consider now the situation when the neighboring region points in roughly opposite direction , forming small patches in the respective regions on @xmath19 .",
    "as the situation with @xmath19 is difficult to visualize , we will consider the simpler situation of two - dimensional skyrmion , with physical space being two dimensional and tunneling region being a disk .",
    "the vacuum manifold in this case will be @xmath51 and a winding one skyrmion will correspond to the stereographic projection of the vacuum manifold @xmath51 on the disk in the physical space .",
    "this is shown in fig.4 where the south pole of the vacuum manifold @xmath51 is mapped to the center of the disk while the north pole is mapped to the boundary of the disk , thereby compactifying the disk to @xmath51 .    .",
    "]      we now consider the situation of the string with two neighboring tunneling regions corresponding to roughly opposite patches on the vacuum manifold .",
    "we note that it should be expected that the tunneling region will form small patches on @xmath19 as presumably only such instantons will dominate the tunneling process .",
    "the size of these patches are of crucial importance here , and these will depend on the calculations of the determinant of fluctuations around the semi - classical instanton background . if the fluctuations are strong , then we expect the patches to have significant size",
    ". the size of the patch will depend on the temperature and one will expect that for high temperature tunneling the patch can be large .",
    "we will explain the underlying physics here by using two - dimensional example and then generalize the arguments for the @xmath19 case .",
    "representing the field configuration in two neighboring regions inside the string . in the bottom figure ,",
    "the string is represented as a strip .",
    "the region in - between the two patches is only sensitive to the parts of the boundaries of the two patches , marked as abc for the left patch and def for the right patch . the field configuration for the intermediate region ,",
    "therefore , is seen to correspond to the dashed lines shown on the @xmath51 in the top figure . ]",
    "the top figure in fig.[br5 ] shows the two patches ( blue color ) abcp and defq on the vacuum manifold @xmath51 representing the field configuration in two neighboring regions inside the string .",
    "the string here is shown as a strip ( lower figure in fig.[br5 ] ) as appropriate for the two - dimensional case .",
    "an important thing to note is the field configuration in - between the two patches in this strip .",
    "as the two regions meet , the chiral field in the junction region will evolve to smoothly interpolate between the two corresponding values on the vacuum manifold @xmath51 .",
    "this is essentially the statement of the so called _ geodesic rule _ in the theory of topological defect formation via domain coalescence , known as the kibble mechanism @xcite .",
    "different tunneling regions in a given segment of string form the uncorrelated domains of the kibble mechanism here .",
    "however , the region in - between the two patches is only sensitive to the parts of the boundaries of the two patches , marked as abc for the left patch and def for the right patch . the field configuration for the intermediate region",
    "is then seen to correspond to the dashed lines shown on the @xmath51 in the top figure in fig.[br5 ] .",
    "the conclusion then is that if the two neighboring tunneling regions in the string core correspond to the two opposite patches as shown in fig.[br5 ] , then the entire region consisting of the two patches , along with the region in between , will correspond to covering of @xmath51 by a surface spanned by the dashed curves on @xmath51 shown in fig.[br5 ] , including the regions of the two patches . to understand the evolution of this field configuration , we recall the discussion of formation of skyrmions via kibble mechanism in phase transitions from ref .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that , in contrast to the formation of domain walls , strings , and monopoles in phase transitions , skyrmions never form with full integer winding number in a phase transition .",
    "this is simply due to the fact the integer winding skyrmion corresponds to a mapping from _ compactified _ three dimensional space to the vacuum manifold @xmath19 .",
    "compactification of three dimensional space requires constant boundary conditions which is virtually impossible to achieve in a phase transition where domains form with randomly varying field configurations .",
    "however , the so called _ partial winding _ skyrmions will routinely form .",
    "these correspond to field configurations which cover part of @xmath19 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that if a partial winding configuration covers more than 50 % of the vacuum manifold @xmath19 , then it will evolve to a complete integer winding skyrmion .",
    "if the configuration covers less then 50 % of @xmath19 then it will shrink down and should decay in perturbative meson excitations .",
    "this is also seen in simulations of the formation of textures in the context of early universe @xcite .",
    "applying the same arguments to our present case , we see that if the two patches do not lie reasonably opposite to each other on @xmath51 the combined region of the two neighboring patches will cover less than half of the vacuum manifold .",
    "in such a situation , the whole configuration will shrink down on @xmath51 decaying into mesons .    however , for the case shown in fig.[br5 ] when the two patches are opposite to each other on @xmath51 , the field in this entire region is likely to cover more than half of the @xmath51 .",
    "further evolution of such a configuration should lead to integer winding skyrmion .",
    "it is simple to see that if a junction of two neighboring domains leads to formation of skyrmions ( anti - skyrmions ) , then the next non - trivial intersection is likely to lead to the formation of anti - skyrmions ( skyrmions ) . if the next intersection happens to lead to topologically trivial configuration , that simply leads to the deformation of the skyrmion .",
    "the probability of having the two neighboring patches in the string which correspond to opposite patches on @xmath51 can be estimated as follows : the average size of the patch on @xmath51 is 1/8 of the surface area of @xmath51 ( see , ref.@xcite ) . with 8 average patches on @xmath51 , the probability of the second patch being opposite to the first one will be 1/8 . thus we will conclude that the probability of the junction region of two tunneling regions to evolve into full winding skyrmion is 1/8 .",
    "this is a crude estimate assuming large patches ( which may be reasonable for high temperature tunneling ) .",
    "if the patches are small then this probability will be suppressed .",
    "the extension to three - dimensional case is then straightforward .",
    "we go back to fig.[br31 ] showing the configuration of @xmath19 skyrmion .",
    "the two neighboring regions will be taken to be opposite patches on this @xmath19 ( like top figure in fig.[br5 ] ) .",
    "the string will now be a tube ( instead of a strip as in fig.[br5 ] ) with the two neighboring regions forming two balls inside this tube .",
    "the dashed curves of fig.[br5 ] will now connect the boundaries of the two balls and will lead to a covering of part of @xmath19 . as we have argued for the two - dimensional case , here also , if the two patches are opposite on @xmath19 then it will be expected to cover more than half of @xmath19 ( using geodesic rule ) .",
    "the evolution of this field configuration should then lead to a full winding skyrmion .",
    "the probability of having two opposite patches is then 1/16 by extension of the above argument ( as average volume of a patch on @xmath19 is 1/16 of the total volume @xcite ) .",
    "this is similar to the probability of 0.05 for the formation of partial winding skyrmions with more than 50 % cover of @xmath19 as estimated in @xcite ( and consistent with the results found in texture simulations @xcite ) .",
    "we also mention that we are considering the chiral limit here with massless pions . with finite pion mass",
    "the sigma model has an explicit symmetry breaking term .",
    "this makes one point on the vacuum manifold ( say south pole ) as the true vacuum , while the opposite point , the north pole , has the highest potential energy .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that with such explicit symmetry breaking , the production of skyrmions - anti - skyrmions may be significantly enhanced .",
    "the same behaviour is expected in our case .",
    "for example , even if the field configuration in the two regions in fig.[br5 ] covers less than half of the vacuum manifold , if it overlaps with the north pole ( the point with highest potential energy ) then the entire field configuration will start rolling down towards the true vacuum , thereby covering the entire vacuum manifold .    even with weak explicit symmetry breaking such effects",
    "will be present . for",
    "strong explicit symmetry breaking one can even think of the possibility that a single instanton having a patch around the north pole may evolve into a full winding skyrmion as the field rolls down everywhere towards the true vacuum thereby covering the entire vacuum manifold .",
    "finally , we note that so far , we considered the encounter of the two bubble regions happens only in the rest frame of the string .",
    "it is important to remember that cosmic strings are actually moving at a speed close to the speed of light .",
    "this means that skyrmions will actually spread outside the string .",
    "since the skyrmions anti - skyrmions pairs that are formed can be interpreted as a production of baryon - anti baryons , the string can be seen as a baryon - antibaryon generator .      the number of instanton formed per unit volume per unit time is equal to the decay rate @xmath57 .",
    "we are considering the case when the decay rate is large compared to the hubble scale , thus we will assume that within a hubble time , a certain number of bubbles per unit length , @xmath58 , nucleate on the string with    @xmath59    here @xmath60 is the estimated radius of the neutral string . for simplicity , we will take all these bubbles to be of same size . then , the number per unit length of two ( neighboring ) domain intersections is also equal to @xmath61 . with the probability of an integer winding skyrmion / anti - skyrmion ( i.e. a baryon / anti - baryon ) formation per junction being 1/16",
    ", we get the number of baryon - anti - baryon produced per unit length @xmath62 from the string as , @xmath63 .",
    "the largest number of bubbles nucleated on the string during hubble time can be simply estimated @xmath64 where @xmath40given by eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) is the radius of the nucleated bubble and @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) is the thin wall parameter . for each value of the temperature @xmath66",
    ", we can thus determine the value of @xmath61 , and hence @xmath62 .",
    "the net baryon density produced by these strings will depend on the string density .",
    "as the relevant temperature regime is not expected to be too much below the transition temperature here , it is unlikely that the string will enter into any scaling regime .",
    "the estimate of string density then becomes difficult as it will depend on string velocity , friction coefficient of string moving through plasma , and the shrinking rate of the string ( without decay as discussed here ) .",
    "another different and straightforward estimate for the formation of skyrmions - anti - skyrmions can be obtained by direct adaptation of calculations of refs.@xcite .",
    "let us consider the situation of a dense network of pionic strings with a high rate of instanton mediated decay process .",
    "with all the strings essentially decaying into multiple tunneling regions , the entire physical region eventually converts to a multi - domain region , almost the same as resulting after a phase transition with domains corresponding to correlation domains .",
    "the typical domain size here is a combination of two length scales : the typical tunneling region size when it intersects another such region , and the average inter - string separation .",
    "assuming these two scales are similar for simplicity , the situation reduces to that of a phase transition as discussed in refs.@xcite . here",
    "one even does not need to assume any spread in the value of the order parameter field in a given domain .",
    "the estimate of skyrmion - anti - skyrmion formation in this case is simply 0.05 per domain . here also , we mention that the estimate of 0.05 skyrmions per domain was for the case of chiral limit . with explicit symmetry breaking",
    "we expect enhanced production of skyrmions .",
    "an important difference in this formation and the earlier one discussed above ( with two domains ) is that in the earlier case net skyrmion number was zero as required by baryon conservation in qcd .",
    "this is because every junction corresponding to a given winding was followed by the next non - trivial junction with opposite winding .",
    "this correlation is not present in the second picture of skyrmion formation . in this second case ,",
    "the conservation of baryon number is not explicitly present .",
    "an attempt to incorporate baryon number conservation in this type of picture has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect is that a baryon asymmetry can also be generated .",
    "in this work we explained and quantified a possible mechanism to create baryons from pion - like cosmic strings namely skyrmion - anti skyrmion production by a metastable string .",
    "we showed that the embedded string of the linear sigma model ( which can be metastable provided we choose the right parameter for the coupling constant ) generates skyrmions with partial or integer winding number .",
    "we quantified the integer winding number skyrmions or anti - skyrmions nucleation per unit length per hubble time which can be interpreted as baryon anti - baryons production .",
    "decay of the string can also arise through meson excitations .",
    "finally we commented on the baryon production from a dense string network and estimated the probability of skyrmion - anti - skyrmion formation to be about 5 % per domain .",
    "there are many effects to consider such that the effect of the string velocity , friction coefficient of string moving through plasma , and the shrinking rate of the string ( without decay as discussed here ) .",
    "we hope to discuss these aspects in a future work .",
