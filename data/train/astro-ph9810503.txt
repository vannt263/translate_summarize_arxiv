    "in astrophysics large @xmath5body systems are generally _ self  gravitating _ , that is the dynamics of the bodies is strongly influenced by the gravitational field produced by the bodies themselves .",
    "this ` self  influence ' makes the exact evaluation of the interactions a particularly heavy task , since the number of operations needed scales like @xmath6 . to overcome this problem",
    "various techniques have been proposed . among them , the tree ",
    "code algorithm proposed by barnes & hut ( see @xcite , @xcite ) is now widely used in astrophysics because it does not require any spatial fixed grid ( like , for example , the ` poisson solver ' methods ) .",
    "this makes it suitable to follow very inhomogeneous and variable ( in time ) situations , typical of self - gravitating systems out of equilibrium .",
    "furthermore its cpu  time scales like @xmath7 .",
    "tree  codes are difficult to parallelize mainly because gravitation is a _ long  range _ force and the evaluation of all the interactions among bodies is not completely separable into a set of independent tasks ( inter - processor communications are inevitable ) .",
    "moreover , astrophysical non - uniform distributions imply great differences in the amount of contributions to the force on each particle , thus a good _ load balancing _ is hard to be achieved .    in the tree ",
    "code we distinguish substantially two parts : i ) a _ tree  setting _ phase where the logical tree structure is built and the various multipolar coefficients of the cells in which the space is subdivided are placed in the corresponding locations ; ii ) a _ tree  walking _ phase in which the force on each particle is evaluated `` walking '' the tree and considering all the cells .    our parallelization was based on a _ work and data sharing _ approach ( using the directives of the hpf / craft language ) and we found that the greatest difficulties in getting good performances are in the tree  setting phase , in which is not easy to avoid _ load unbalancing _ among the pes , due mainly to _ synchronization _ points .",
    "after various attempts , we adopted a sophisticated scheme whose details can be found in @xcite .    to test the speed - up of our parallelized code on realistic distributions",
    ", we located @xmath8 particles scaling the quite clumped density distribution of a sample of galaxies in the northern galactic hemisphere ( see @xcite ) .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we show the speed - up results obtained on a cray t3e for both phases i ) and ii ) as well as the total speed - up .",
    "the tree  setting is confirmed as the most difficult part of the algorithm to be well parallelized , while the tree  walking speed - up has a quite good behavior in spite of that it uses intensively remote reading . in fig.[fig2 ] the work load distribution is shown for the run with 8 processors , for both phases .",
    "note how load balancing is very good for the tree  walking phase , while for the tree  setting there are differences among pes work load which , in any case , do not exceed the 20% of the average .    to conclude , the results are rather good : the total speed - up is high enough and it does not show any flattening , at least for @xmath9 .",
    "one has to consider also that for @xmath10 the amount of particles per processor is not that high ( less than 5,000 ) .",
    "we think that using more particles we would get even better results .",
