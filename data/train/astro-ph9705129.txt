    "the first reported observations of a globular cluster system ( gcs ) , or population , around an external galaxy was by hubble ( 1932 ) , who `` provisionally identified as globular clusters '' the relatively bright , slightly extended objects in the halo of m31 .",
    "progress in the study of extragalactic gcs was slow however , and it was more than twenty years before baum ( 1955 ) identified the brightest members of the extremely rich gcs which surrounds m87 , the central giant elliptical in the virgo cluster .",
    "more detailed photographic studies of this system would be another decade in coming ( racine 1968a , b ) .",
    "the first gcs to be observed at a distance significantly beyond virgo was by smith & weedman ( 1976 ) , who reported a statistical excess of @xmath520 stellar objects around ngc  3311 , the cd galaxy at the center of the hydra cluster . at @xmath53500 ,",
    "hydra is one of the nearest abell clusters ( abell 1060 ) , and the detection by smith & weedman represented @xmath60.2% of the total gc population of this galaxy .",
    "significant further progress in the study of gcss , particularly around m87-like galaxies in clusters , awaited advances in astronomical imaging and analysis techniques .",
    "the revolution in astronomy sparked by ccds reached the field of extragalactic gc research in the mid-1980s .",
    "van  den bergh  ( 1985 ) used the new tool to study the m87 gcs , reaching for the first time beyond the turnover point in this galaxy s globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) .",
    "ccd studies of gcs around ellipticals in leo ( pritchet & van den bergh 1985 ) , coma ( harris 1987 ; thompson & valdes 1987 ) , and virgo ( cohen 1988 ) followed soon after . with the revolutionary image quality of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , it is now possible to image two magnitudes beyond the turnover in the m87 gclf , ( whitmore  1995 ) , reach unprecedented depths along the coma gclf ( baum  1995 ) , and study a larger number of smaller gcss in detail ( forbes  1996a ) .",
    "besides the boon to gcs research , ccds allowed for the development of the sbf method of distance measurement ( tonry & schneider 1988 ; but see also shopbell et al .",
    "1993 , who showed that it could be done , with considerable effort , on photographic plates ) .",
    "the sbf method measures the seeing - convolved variance , or `` fluctuations , '' produced by the poisson statistics of the stars in an early - type galaxy .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations decreases with the square of the distance to the galaxy , and when divided by the galaxy s mean surface brightness , yields the luminosity - weighted average flux of the stars within the galaxy .",
    "this flux , usually referred to in terms of magnitudes and called , gives the distance to the galaxy after proper calibration .    in the present work ,",
    "the sbf image analysis methods are used to measure the `` bumpiness '' in a galaxy image due to gcs . traditionally , gc populations around galaxies have been studied through their brightest members , which appear as an excess of faint point sources with roughly the same distribution as the halo light .",
    "however , they can also be studied through the surface brightness variance ( `` bumpiness '' ) produced in the image by the remainder of the population ( those too faint to be detected as point sources ) .",
    "this variance is a nuisance which must be subtracted from the stellar sbf amplitude in order to derive a distance , as in the sbf survey ( tonry et al .",
    "however , it can also be used as a probe of the gc population . by using the counts of the brightest gcs together with the variance from the rest of the gcs",
    ", we can constrain the luminosity function and determine the total gc population much more accurately , and to much larger distances .",
    "the number of gcs per unit @xmath7@xmath8@xmath915 of galaxy luminosity is known as the `` specific frequency ( or number ) of globular clusters , '' abbreviated  ( @xcite ) .",
    "some luminous central galaxies in clusters , m87 being the most famous , have huge gc populations with @xmath1012 , about three times the typical value for giant ellipticals .",
    "speculation on the origin of these `` anomalous '' , or `` high- '' , systems has abounded , but there have been few observational constraints . in the first application of our analysis method ( blakeslee & tonry 1995 ; hereafter @xcite ) , we studied the gc populations of the two central giants in the coma cluster , nearly six times more distant than virgo . due to the success of that project",
    ", we undertook a larger , systematic study of an unbiased sample of brightest galaxies in abell clusters using the same technique .",
    "our goal was to make significant progress towards understanding the seemingly unpredictable variations in the observed values of these galaxies .",
    "here we report on the results of that study .    along the way",
    ", we have learned more about the gclf , usually represented by a gaussian distribution in magnitudes : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total number density of gcs , @xmath13 is the apparent mean , or `` turnover '' magnitude , and @xmath3 is the gaussian dispersion , or `` width '' . the gclf has been used extensively as a distance indicator based upon the universality of the absolute magnitude of the turnover @xmath14 ( see whitmore 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "hst increases by at least a factor of five the maximum distance to which this method can be used and may soon resolve the lingering questions regarding possible variations in @xmath14 . in our initial coma study ,",
    "we extended by a factor of five the distance to which gclf widths had been measured , and subsequent work reported here has gone further still .    in the following section we discuss the sample selection for this study and describe the observations . in section  3",
    ", we detail the data reduction and analysis procedure , essentially the same as that of @xcite .",
    "section  4 presents the results on the specific frequencies and gclfs of the sample galaxies , and section  5 explores the relationship of  to other properties of the galaxies and the galaxy clusters .",
    "we find the first clear evidence for strong correlations of  with cluster properties ; some of which were presented previously by blakeslee ( 1997a ) . in section  6 ,",
    "we compare our results to those predicted by various models and attempt to synthesize the simplest scenario consistent with observations .",
    "the final section summarizes this work .",
    "the galaxy sample used in this study was selected from the lauer & postman  ( 1994 ; hereafter lp ) volume - limited survey of brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in 119 abell and aco galaxy clusters ( abell 1958 ; abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) . the lp sample includes nearly all the abell / aco clusters with redshift @xmath15  and galactic latitude @xmath16 .",
    "seven clusters were excluded from their survey because of spiral , star - forming irregular , or anomalously faint bcgs , six `` clusters '' were not true galaxy over - densities , and two were not observed by lp .",
    "postman & lauer ( 1995 ; hereafter pl ) present and discuss the data used by lp , including observations of second brightest , or second ranked , galaxies in clusters for which the magnitude offset between first and second was small .    to ensure that reasonably accurate statistical statements about gcss would result , we selected as complete a subsample as possible from the lp survey .",
    "the final sample studied here includes all of the northern hemisphere lp and pl galaxies with @xmath17  and @xmath18 , where @xmath19log@xmath20log@xmath21 is the logarithmic slope of the galaxy luminosity evaluated at the metric radius @xmath22  .",

    "( a cd galaxy is a giant elliptical that possesses an extended , low surface brightness halo ; its radial profile exhibits a significant excess of light relative to an  law .",
    "see tonry [ 1987 ] for a review . )",
    "thus , the sample comprises 23 galaxies in 19 abell clusters , two of which are the coma galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "of the nine true clusters omitted by lp , only a426 ( the perseus cluster , with its giant disturbed bcg perseus  a ) and a400 ( which lp reject as `` anomalously faint '' ) are within the above redshift and coordinate cutoffs .",

    "collecting data for this project was not the primary goal of either of the first two runs . only the two coma galaxies from @xcite were observed in the 0593 run , and only one sample galaxy was observed during 0794 .",
    "the 0593 images were binned 2@xmath312 to yield 0343  pix@xmath32 .",
    "after imaging in the @xmath26  band for the first two runs , we chose to take the remainder of the data in @xmath0 for several reasons : ( 1 )  the @xmath0 band is near the peak sensitivity of the ccd , ( 2 ) thinned chips like the mdm tek 1024@xmath30 ( the detector of choice for its high quantum efficiency ) show significant fringing in  @xmath26 , ( 3 ) the stellar sbf is relatively stronger in @xmath26 , with @xmath9@xmath33 , while @xmath34 for gcs , ( 4 ) the sky is much brighter in @xmath26 than @xmath0 , and ( 5 ) pl report precise aperture photometry in @xmath0 , which can be used as a cross - check for our photometry ( blakeslee  1998 ) .",
    "a glass @xmath0 filter provides a much better match to the standard bandpass , so it was used in lieu of an interference filter ; the reverse is true in the @xmath26  band , where the open red end of glass filters makes them a poor choice for ccd photometry .",
    "high signal - to - noise flat fields were produced for each night as follows .",
    "the individual frames were bias corrected by fitting the overscan region of the ccd ( which had variable top - to - bottom structure in the bias ) to a @xmath55th order spline and subtracting .",
    "each frame was then windowed and divided by the straight sum of all the frames , allowing any stars present to be easily identified and masked out .",
    "the sum was then multiplied back in and deviant pixels due to cosmic rays hits were identified by an automatic procedure ( tonry  1997 ) .",
    "the pixels affected by the cosmic rays and stars were then replaced by scaled data values determined according to the pixels values in the rest of the image stack .",
    "the frames were then summed to to produce the final flat field .",

    "the landolt standard star fields used in this project are mostly the same as those listed by tonry  ( 1997 ) .",
    "they were selected because of the large number of observations made by landolt on each , and consequent small magnitude uncertainties , and because of the number of stars present within a @xmath35 field .",
    "following landolt ( 1992 ) , and as in tonry  ( 1997 ) , we summed the flux from each photometric standard within an aperture of 7  radius .",
    "standard star measurements with estimated errors larger than 0.02  mag from flux , sky , and landolt magnitude uncertainties were discarded .",
    "after all the standard star observations from a run were reduced , the results were fitted according to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the magnitude reported by landolt in the appropriate band , @xmath38 the total counts in electrons from the star within 7 , @xmath39 the exposure time in seconds , @xmath40 the zenith angle , and comes from landolt .",

    "the individual exposures making up a galaxy observation were bias subtracted and flattened before being brought into registration based on the positions of stars in the images .",
    "bad pixels were masked , and the frames were then combined , rejecting cosmic ray hits , to make the final galaxy image .",
    "the following two subsections discuss the properties of the images which make up the present data set .",
    "one measure of the depth of an observation is the quantity , the magnitude of an object which will produce one count per total image integration time , corrected for galactic extinction : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the extinction in the @xmath44 band .",
    "thus , the extinction corrected magnitude of an object yielding @xmath38 total counts in the image can be calculated as :   @xmath45 .",
    "so ,  indicates the amount of signal in an image , but takes no account of the noise",
    ".    it would be helpful to have some measure of the quality of an image , i.e. , the suitability of an observation for yielding the desired information .",
    "the approximate signal - to - noise ratio ( ) of a sky - limited object producing @xmath38 counts within the  full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the sky level in counts / arcsec@xmath30 and  is the fwhm in arcsec .",
    "( to calculate the true signal - to - noise , the galaxy background would also need to be taken into account . ) for a given luminosity , such as a fixed point along the gclf , the flux received by the detector scales as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the distance to the source .",
    "thus , in order to reach the same  at this fixed luminosity , the exposure time must scale as @xmath50 .",
    "exposure times for our sample galaxies were scaled in this way ( taking into account sky background and seeing variations ) , with the goal being to reach within @xmath512  mag or so of the expected gclf turnover  while the point source identification was still @xmath5290% complete .",
    "it is interesting to view eq .",
    "( [ eq : snr1 ] ) in terms of magnitudes : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the magnitude of the object within the  fwhm and @xmath55 is the sky surface brightness in mag / arcsec@xmath30 .",
    "for a  which approximates a two dimensional gaussian , the total flux is about twice the flux within the fwhm .",
    "the obvious characteristic magnitude for gc studies is , the point at which the gclf turns over .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the images in this project do not generally approach ; however , if we plug in @xmath56 , the object under consideration will be one which is twice as bright as , e.g. , a globular cluster 0.75  mag brighter than the gclf turnover .",

    "we can estimate  from its measured value in the virgo cluster , first placing virgo into the cmb frame using the relative distance between it and one of the sample clusters . from the review by van den bergh ( 1992 ) , we adopt @xmath59 mag as the relative coma - virgo distance modulus .",
    "recently , baum  ( 1997 ) have found @xmath60 mag from a maximum likelihood comparison of hst observations of the gclf in ic  4051 with the hst gclf from whitmore  ( 1995 ) .",
    "they also cite the work of giovanelli ( 1996 ) as indicating @xmath61 mag .",
    "however , the large , homogeneous `` mark  iii '' catalog ( willick  1997 ) of tully - fisher distances yields @xmath62 mag ( willick 1997 ) , and a re - investigation of the @xmath63@xmath3 and fundamental plane relations in the two clusters finds @xmath64 mag ( donofrio  1997 ) .",
    "the value we have adopted is in agreement with these determinations , while values near 4.0  mag are not .",

    "galaxies a347 - 1 and a569 - 1 were both observed twice , and each observation was reduced independently .",
    "for these two galaxies the strong dependence of the number of identified objects on  is clearly evident .",
    "of course ,  does not tell the whole story .",
    "the total signal - to - noise of the data scales also with the square  root of the number of gcs present in the image .",
    "this can not be known ahead of time , though some estimates might be made based on galaxy luminosity . for comparison purposes ,",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] includes the information on the coma observations presented and analyzed by @xcite . both of these galaxies happened to have very rich gc populations .",
    "consequently , it was possible to learn a good deal about them , despite the fact that their  values are among the lowest in the table .",
    "( although the comparison is not really fair , as those images were in the @xmath26-band where the sky is much brighter but the galaxy background is not , and we have neglected the galaxy background here . )        as in @xcite , we mask out all the easily visible stars and small galaxies before fitting a smooth model to the galaxy light . for many of these fields , the main galaxy and several smaller galaxies were modeled and subtracted using an iterative procedure . in some of the images , however , the multiple galaxies are comparable in size , close together , and show interaction .",
    "for these galaxies , a single smooth galaxy model could not be fitted at the first iteration ; thus , we used the simultaneous nucleus fitting software developed by lauer ( 1988 ) and also used by lp .",
    "after simultaneously modeling and subtracting the primary galaxy and its secondary nuclei , we added the primary back in and could then successfully model it with our software .",
    "the same was done for the rest of the nuclei until all of them had been modeled and subtracted , minimizing the model residuals .",
    "an extreme case can be seen in figure  [ fig : a539 - 2.mod ] , which shows the model generated in this way for a539 - 2 .    after subtracting the final galaxy model , we mask all visible objects and fit the large scale model residuals to a grid of spacing roughly 10  times the size of the , interpolating between grid points .",
    "subtraction of the large scale residuals leaves a very flat `` residual image '' on which the point source photometry and power spectrum measurements described below are carried out .",
    "the automatic photometry program dophot ( schechter  1993 ) was run on an integer version of each residual image in which saturated stars , `` large '' dwarf galaxies , and other bad features had been masked .",
    "afterwards , dophot s model image ( generated by taking the difference of the input and output images ) was closely inspected for extended objects which had been fitted as tight bunches or strings of point sources .",
    "objects larger than dophot s fit box can not be fitted as single objects , but even some smaller ones refuse to conform to any reasonable model dophot might try .",
    "thus , in all cases , it was necessary to mask out these problematic objects ( which sometimes included residuals from the galaxy subtraction ) and re - run dophot . aside from these aberrant cases",
    ", dophot does a good job of distinguishing between point sources and extended objects , as tests performed by ajhar , blakeslee , & tonry ( 1994 ) showed .",
    "this proves to be useful for rejecting possible dwarf galaxies , perhaps as faint as the brightest gcs , which may cluster around the bcg .",
    "dophot s fit magnitudes must be calibrated onto an absolute scale .",
    "this is done by taking the median difference of the aperture and fit magnitudes for the @xmath4120 brightest objects .",
    "judging from the scatter among these objects , the uncertainty in this correction is 0.020.03  mag , or about twice as large as the photometric uncertainty from the standard star calibration .",
    "the total number of unique objects identified and fitted by dophot in each field were listed in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "these numbers do not precisely reflect the relative densities of objects among the images because the final field size varies due to unequal telescope shifting , windowing , and masking ( as well as different detectors in a few cases ) , but they convey a general impression of the number of objects present in each residual image .      in order to determine the completeness of dophot in finding point sources as a function of magnitude , a bright , but not saturated , isolated star was chosen from each field and cloned into a grid of stars with separation @xmath510 . the grid was then scaled 57 times in 0.5  mag steps , with the noise in the grid increased appropriately for each scaling .",
    "the brightest scaling was at @xmath6622.023.0 , depending on the depth of the image .",
    "each scaled grid of stars was added to a separate copy of the real data , and dophot was run on the image ; all parameters were set to the same values as in the original run",
    ". then the results of each run were matched to the grid stars to determine the completeness and any possible magnitude bias .",
    "the test results for each field were used in choosing the cutoff magnitude @xmath67 at which the point source completeness was @xmath590% and the photometric error small .",
    "actually , the completeness depends on radius , so typically two different cutoff magnitudes were used , with @xmath67 being 0.5  mag fainter outside the central @xmath68 . for each separate region of the image ,",

    "the primary reason for this procedure was to determine the background contamination from unresolved galaxies or faint stars .",
    "many different binnings were explored for each field , and an average background value was chosen from among the fits .",

    "we use the same power spectrum analysis method as was used by @xcite , and described in more detail by tonry  ( 1990 ) .",

    "most of the observations reported here are in the @xmath0 band , unlike the coma @xmath26-band observations of @xcite , but the correction for the stellar sbf is done in the same way , relative to the measured value of the fluctuation magnitude in virgo , where @xmath8431.25 for the bcg ngc  4472 and other big ellipticals ( tonry  1990 ) .",
    "we include a generous allowance of 0.30  mag for the uncertainty in  ( intrinsic variations in  have not been well studied ) .",
    "the contribution from the uncertainty in the relative distances with respect to virgo is included in the discussions of the calibrational errors in  [ ssec : widths ] and  [ ssec : sn ] .",
    "while the mean  color of the gcs is about 0.55 ( ajhar , blakeslee , & tonry 1994 ) , the galaxy color is @xmath850.68 , and the color of the sbf is ( ) @xmath851.6 ( tonry  1990 ) .",

    "the gc fluctuations in the @xmath0  band are roughly three times stronger relative to the sbf than they are in the @xmath26 band .",
    "otherwise , this ratio of fluctuation powers scales with @xmath67 and distance modulus as shown in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "we included @xmath88-corrections in our estimates of the fluctuation magnitudes to account for the slightly different region of the rest frame spectrum that passes through the imaging filter as a function of galaxy redshift .",
    "the corrections were based on calculations done by worthey ( 1996 ) , who kindly redshifted his published stellar populations models ( worthey 1994 ) . unlike for the sbf survey ( tonry  1997 ) , where @xmath89 was used for the  @xmath88-correction , the correction here was not well described by a linear function out to the redshift limit of this sample ; however , a quadratic form proved adequate . the effect of the @xmath88-correction in the @xmath0  band is to make the estimate of the contamination from the stellar sbf smaller by 8% at 5000  and by 13% at 10,000 , the limit of this survey . in practice ,",
    "the stellar sbf contamination is only @xmath510% , so this small correction to it does not change the final results in any significant way , but it is important for avoiding bias .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath88-correction based on the scatter in worthey s models was included in the calculation of our errors .    the larger correction ( @xmath51050%",
    ", depending on @xmath90 and radius in the galaxy ) to the measured variance is the one applied to account for the faint background galaxies . as in the sbf survey and @xcite ,",
    "this is done by extrapolating the results from maximum likelihood routine ( to be described by ajhar  [ 1997 ] ) which fits the magnitude distribution of the galaxies to a power law in the outer parts of the image , using the observed radial variation in the counts to subtract off the gcs .",
    "this background estimation can be a difficult and uncertain procedure when the galaxy nearly fills the image , but in such cases the relative size of the correction will be smaller . out of necessity , the slope of the galaxy magnitude distribution is taken from tyson ( 1988 ) , and the normalization @xmath91 is fitted relative to his counts over the faintest few magnitudes of the image , in order to avoid possible dwarf satellites of the central galaxy .",

    "the variance due to background galaxies is calculated according to eq .",
    "( 9 ) of @xcite and subtracted along with the sbf estimate from the measured variance @xmath76 in order to obtain @xmath92 , the variance due to gcs .",
    "there is one other source of contamination to the variance measurement which one might consider , namely the possibility that a concentration of very faint dwarf galaxies may surround the bcg and contribute to @xmath76 . for such dwarfs to cause problems",
    ", they would have to have a spatial distribution similar to the gcs ( so as not to mimic the background galaxies ) and a distribution in apparent magnitude extending fainter than @xmath67 .",
    "for our sample , @xmath90 is typically @xmath52.5  mag ; thus , the dwarfs would have to be fainter than about @xmath93 ( adopting a distance scale as in  [ ssec : sn ] ) .",
    "the only known galaxies of such low luminosity are diffuse , low surface brightness dwarf speroidal ( dsph ) members of the local group ( and possibly one faint member of virgo , outside the cluster core [ durrell 1997 ] ) ; these objects would surely be destroyed in the halo of a giant galaxy at the center of a rich cluster .",
    "coma is the only abell cluster with a well studied faint - end of the galaxy luminosity function , and the data are basically similar to what is observed in virgo ( e.g. , ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "thomas & gregory ( 1993 ) and lobo  ( 1997 ) studied the dwarf galaxy luminosity function down to about @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "they both concluded that down to these luminosities , the dwarf elliptical ( de ) and dsph populations followed the same spatial distribution as the larger cluster galaxies , except in the cluster core where the dsph galaxies had apparently been destroyed .",
    "( no significant population of gas - rich dwarf irregulars were detected . )",
    "both sets of authors suggested that the faintest dwarfs in the cluster core may have been tidally destroyed or accreted .",
    "however , bernstein  1995 identified dwarf galaxies in the coma core down to almost @xmath96 , although by this point the great majority of the objects were gcs , even @xmath97 ( @xmath5100  ) from the central galaxy .",
    "numerical simulations by bassino  ( 1994 ) showed that the only surviving remants of dwarf satellite galaxies in the halo of an m87-like giant galaxy were the dense centers of nucleated de galaxies .",
    "( non - nucleated de galaxies were destroyed entirely after a few orbits . ) for nuclei with luminosities comparable to gcs to survive , they need to be about as dense as gcs , i.e. , they would at that point essentially _ be _ gcs .",

    "we must first estimate the value of the gclf turnover @xmath13 in each galaxy .",
    "the value of @xmath104 in virgo is @xmath105 ( whitmore  1995 ; secker & harris 1993 ) .",
    "transforming to the @xmath0  band increases the uncertainty to @xmath50.07 mag . although virgo is too near to have been included in the abell catalog , its galaxy density is equivalent to that of a richness class  1 abell cluster ( girardi  1995 ) , and it is therefore a valid calibrating object .",
    "the cmb velocity of virgo is @xmath106  ( see  [ ssec : qual ] ) , contributing an uncertainty of 0.12  mag to the calibration .",

    "we adopt a value of 0.2  mag as a best estimate of the intrinsic dispersion in  among giant ellipticals in clusters ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "it is also necessary to consider the possibility of abell cluster radial peculiar velocities with respect to the cmb frame ; these will have an effect on both @xmath13 and the estimated galaxy luminosity .",

    "we will adopt a compromise value of 400   for the rms radial peculiar velocities of abell clusters in the cmb frame .",

    "figure  [ fig : sigunc_cmb ] plots the derived @xmath3 values from this analysis against their uncertainties .",
    "the two coma galaxies from @xcite are included in the figure .",
    "( for values with asymmetric errorbars , the average of the errors is used . ) the results cluster near @xmath114  mag when the uncertainty is small , but drift higher when the uncertainty becomes large .",

    "the overall weighted mean is @xmath115  mag , the median is 1.46 mag , and the unweighted mean is 1.49  mag with a dispersion of 0.13  mag .",
    "( without the @xcite galaxies , the weighted mean , median , and unweighted values become 1.46 , 1.49 , and 1.50  mag , respectively , with the same dispersion . )",
    "however , if we exclude the values of @xmath3 with uncertainties greater than 0.15  mag , where the upward bias appears to set in , the weighted mean is @xmath116  mag , and the median and unweighted mean are both 1.42  mag , with a 0.07  mag dispersion .",
    "( excluding the @xcite galaxies now makes no difference in these numbers . )",
    "it is not possible to eliminate this bias toward larger @xmath3 by altering the gclf  calibration in any reasonable way .",
    "( for instance , adopting the baum  [ 1997 ] calibration makes no difference in the size of the apparent bias . )",
    "we tentatively conclude that the gclf width is the same for the whole sample .",
    "however , the more poorly determined values are biased towards larger @xmath3 , which causes one to wonder if there might also be some bias remaining in the mean of the low - error results .",
    "we consult the literature for insight into this question , then offer an explanation as to the most likely cause of the bias .    the primary gclf calibrator for this analysis was m87 , which is known to have @xmath117  mag from hst measurements ( whitmore  1995 ) .",
    "other well - measured gclfs which provide reasonable comparisons for our sample are those of the virgo bcg ngc  4472 , @xmath118  mag ( secker & harris 1993 ) ; the fornax cd ngc  1399 , @xmath119 ( @xcite ) ; the giant virgo background elliptical ngc  4365 , @xmath120 ( forbes 1996 , hst measurement ) ; and ngc  5846 , the central giant elliptical in a compact group , @xmath121 ( forbes  1996b , also with hst ) .",

    "( note that bt95 found @xmath122  mag for m87 , but that was with @xmath13 fixed to be 0.45  mag too faint , based on the mclaughlin  [ 1994 ] results ; setting @xmath13 to the proper value yielded a @xmath3 of 1.45  mag ) .    in recent years",
    ", other functional forms besides gaussians have been explored for fitting the gclf .",
    "the most commonly used alternative is the `` @xmath123 '' distribution proposed by secker ( 1992 ) , but intersecting exponentials ( baum  1995 ) , tilted hyperbolic functions ( baum  1997 ) , and gauss - hermite expansions ( abraham & van den bergh 1995 ) have also been tried .",
    "what these alternate forms have in common is that their tails are broader than gaussian , i.e. , they are all `` wingy '' , and they were all motivated by the smaller gcss ( 200300 members ) of the milky way and m31 .",
    "the gclfs of large ellipticals with many thousand gcs , such as m87 ( whitmore  1995 ) and ngc  1399 ( @xcite ) , are usually quite gaussian .",
    "thus , we would expect the gclfs of our program galaxies to be gaussian .",
    "as abraham & van den bergh conclude , `` for most applications , a simple gaussian description is an adequate representation of the data . ''",
    "however , the galaxies in our sample with poorly constrained and obviously biased measured values of @xmath3 are the ones which are either among the smallest and relatively poorest in gcs ( a634 - 1 , a1016 - 1 ) or , in the case of a2162 - 1 , suffered from poor seeing so that only the very brightest members far out in the tail contributed to the direct counts .",
    "if the counts are enhanced relative to the gaussian model used for the @xmath108 minimization , the derived @xmath3 will be too large .",
    "this was pointed out by @xcite and graphically illustrated in figure  2 - 4 of blakeslee ( 1997b ) .",
    "we believe this to be the most likely explanation for the bias in the under - constrained widths .",
    "a direct comparison in the following section of  derived from counts and fluctuations with fixed @xmath3 supports this view .",
    "the galaxies for which the counts penetrated to greater depths along the gclf , or have no excess of bright gcs relative to a gaussian , will not be similarly biased .",
    "the fact that the median @xmath3 of the low - error measurements is 1.42  mag , virtually identical to the m87 calibrating gclf value of 1.40  mag , supports this view .",
    "moreover , it indicates that the working hypothesis of a universal gclf for central galaxies in rich clusters has been vindicated .    to summarize",
    ", we have measured the gclf widths of the abell cluster galaxies in this sample .",
    "although the under - constrained values are biased high , the remainder appear to be accurate .",
    "we find no evidence for any intrinsic dispersion among these better measured widths , and their average is very close to the value for m87 , whose turnover magnitude  and cmb velocity were used to estimate  for the program galaxies , thereby allowing us to derive the gclf widths .",
    "this result provides a valuable consistency check in support of the assumption of a universal gclf for bright ellipticals in abell clusters . in the previous section ,",
    "we estimated the systematic uncertainty in the  calibration to be @xmath124 mag , mainly due to the uncertainty in the cmb velocity of virgo .",
    "varying the estimates of  by this amount has the effect of changing the individual gclf widths by 0.040.06 mag .",
    "thus , we conclude that among the gclf width measurements with internal uncertainties smaller than 0.15  mag , the mean is @xmath125 mag , where the first errorbar reflects the internal error and the second indicates the systematic uncertainty .",
    "we note that if we had set the virgo cmb velocity using the baum  ( 1997 ) value of the relative coma - virgo distance , the derived values of @xmath3 would be larger by 0.10 - 0.15 mag , and @xmath126 would increase by 0.12  mag .",
    "a discrepancy of this size would be difficult to resolve .    because we find no evidence of significant differences in gclf @xmath3 between m87 and the sample galaxies or among the sample galaxies themselves , we report specific frequencies in the following section assuming the hst m87 value of @xmath127  mag .",
    "for an intrinsic dispersion in this value , we assume @xmath128  mag , consistent with our low - error results ( which are in fact consistent with no intrinsic dispersion ) and with the scatter in the measured widths of nearby dominant ellipticals .",
    "this approach was chosen because the derived  is strongly anticorrelated with the value of  @xmath3 . in this way",
    ", we hope to avoid biased intercomparisons among the  results for these galaxies .",
    "if @xmath101 is the total number of gcs in a galaxy and @xmath129 is its absolute @xmath130 magnitude , the specific frequency is @xmath131 . in order to calculate",
    ", one must adopt a zero point for the distance scale .",
    "up to this point , all magnitudes have been set relative to their observed values in virgo , using the coma - virgo relative distance to place virgo in the cmb frame .",
    "we now adopt a virgo distance modulus of 31.02 based on four virgo spirals with cepheid distance moduli ( freedman  1996 ; there is also one about 1  mag more distant ) .",

    "the two separate measurements were then weighted averaged , and all the gcs between some inner radial limit , discussed below , and an outer radius of 40  kpc ( or 32  and @xmath136 ) were summed ; the result was then divided by the normalized luminosity of the galaxy within the same radial range to derive the `` metric @xmath1 '' within 40  kpc .",
    "this was repeated for @xmath137 and 1.45  mag , and then for @xmath135 but with @xmath13 varied according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : m0unc ] ) .",
    "( for , unlike @xmath3 , the distance uncertainty due to random cluster velocities largely cancels , since it similarly effects both @xmath12 and the galaxy luminosity . ) the variation in  due to the uncertainties in these gclf parameters was then added in quadrature to the internal errors which had been propagated from the counts and fluctuations .",
    "table  [ tab : snsig_cmb ] lists the metric  results , with their final errors , for each galaxy .",
    "( these were previously presented by blakeslee [ 1997a , b ] . )",
    "it also lists the derived values of @xmath3 discussed in the previous section , but these are not the ones used in calculating the tabulated values of .    for reference , we list in table  [ tab : snflucount ] the specific frequency values @xmath138 and @xmath139 derived separately from the variance measurements and the counts , respectively , with gclf @xmath3 fixed at 1.40  mag .",
    "the internal measurement errors shown in the table include no allowance for uncertainty in the gclf  or @xmath3 , and are therefore uncorrelated .",
    "the value of the width @xmath3 which would bring @xmath138 and @xmath139 into precise agreement for a given galaxy is the one listed in table  [ tab : snsig_cmb ] for that galaxy .",
    "table  [ tab : snflucount ] also lists the number of standard deviations @xmath140 separating the two  values .",
    "note that the four galaxies with @xmath1412 all have @xmath142 and best - fit @xmath143 mag ( table  [ tab : snsig_cmb ] ) , consistent with the bias in the gclf width measurements being due to counts which are enhanced relative to a gaussian model .",
    "however , we did not feel that this would justify throwing away the information provided by the counts .",
    "estimates of the global  involve two very uncertain extrapolations of the gcs and galaxy profiles out to large radii . not only are small uncertainties magnified by the extrapolations , but there is often no guarantee that the profiles do not change outside the imaged field .",
    "thus , we chose not to make such extrapolations . the decision to report metric values of  ( i.e.",
    ", values derived within the same physical radius around each galaxy ) was made in order to avoid a bias in the reported  with redshift .",
    "the metric radius of 40  kpc was chosen because it corresponds to the limit of the image for the nearest of the sample galaxies ( roughly 500  pix , or 23 , in the 1024@xmath30 @xmath0-band images ) . finally , the inner radius varied a bit and was set by practical constraints from the variable quality of the model subtraction at small radii .",
    "in effect , the inner limit was the smallest usable radius , typically smaller ( in angle on the sky ) for the more distant galaxies , but never less than 10 , corresponding roughly to the expected gcs core radius in the nearest galaxies ( forbes  1996a ) .",
    "it makes little difference , however , as such a small portion of the gcs is involved .",
    "note that since  is number per unit galaxy luminosity , if the gcs follow the same radial distribution as the halo light ( true to at least first order ) , the `` metric '' will actually be independent of the chosen metric radius and will equal the global .",
    "henceforward , by  we will mean these metric specific frequencies , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the  values listed in the table for a1656 - 1 ( ngc  4889 ) and a1656 - 2 ( ngc  4874 ) differ from the global values quoted in @xcite for two reasons .",
    "first , the rc2 photometry ( de vaucouleurs  1976 ) used there was in error .",
    "it gave a total magnitude for ngc  4874 that was substantially too faint , as well as a slightly too faint total magnitude for ngc  4889 . using the photometry from the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs  1991 ) yields global values of @xmath144 for ngc 4874 and @xmath145 for ngc 4889 , closer to those shown in table  [ tab : snsig_cmb ] .",
    "second , as stated above , the table gives the metric  values within a limited radial range , using our own photometry of the galaxy light within that range .",
    "as the gc systems of those two galaxies were found to be more extended than the halo light , it is expected that their metric  would be smaller than their global , and we see from the table that this is the case .",
    "we conclude with some comments on the measured values of  for these galaxies and their uncertainties .",
    "our results indicate the existence of a continuum of  values , rather than a separation of galaxies into `` normal '' and `` high '' @xmath1 classes . for each of the three clusters with more than one galaxy in our sample , it is the second brightest galaxy that has the higher  ( although in the case of a539 the difference is not significant ) .",
    "these galaxies were included in the sample because they are all giant ellipticals with luminosities similar to those of the corresponding bcgs selected by lp .",
    "in fact , table  [ tab : bcg ] shows that they all have larger @xmath146 parameters than the bcgs , and comparison of their coordinates with those in table  [ tab : cls ] indicates that they are all closer to their cluster x - ray centers .",
    "thus , for these three clusters , the most centrally dominant galaxy happens to be the second brightest one .",
    "we discuss below how central location in a cluster might affect .",
    "we have attempted to keep the  errors listed in table  [ tab : snsig_cmb ] both realistic and independent of each other .",
    "however , it is possible that they may include some systematic components , and therefore not be completely independent of each other . if , for example , the intrinsic ( random ) dispersion in @xmath14 is only @xmath50.1 mag instead of @xmath50.2 mag , then the final errors will all be similarly overestimated , which is to say that they would contain a systematic component , and not be what we loosely term `` independent '' .",
    "it seems unlikely , though , that the intrinsic dispersion in the gclf width is less than the 0.05  mag we have adopted .",
    "the uncertainties from the gclf parameters dominate , being 13  times as large as the uncertainties due to measurement error , depending on the size of the gc population and the depth of the data .",
    "the tabulated errors are offered as best estimates of the random ( i.e. , non - systematic ) uncertainties in the individual  values , but due to a preference to err on the side of caution , it is possible that these quoted random errors may be systematically overestimated .    finally , we discuss the effects on the  results of the estimated @xmath124 mag systematic uncertainty in the @xmath13 calibration . increasing the individual  estimates by 0.15  mag",
    "has the effect of increasing the derived  values by @xmath147% ; decreasing  systematically by the same amount decreases the derived  values by @xmath148% .",
    "thus , the `` top '' of the  continuum for this sample may move upward from 9.3 to 11.1 , as the `` bottom '' moves from 3 to 3.6 , or the top and bottom may decrease together to 7.9 and 2.5 , respectively .",
    "these estimates assume that the galaxy luminosities are held fixed ; varying them along with  decreases the leeway to just a few percent , but the relative uncertainties in the virgo distance modulus ( which sets the zero point for the luminosities ) and cmb velocity ( which sets for each cluster with respect to virgo ) are similar in size .",
    "the values of  and gclf width @xmath3 reported and discussed in previous sections were all calculated in the cmb frame .",
    "however , there is another relevant frame which might also have been adopted , the abell cluster inertial ( aci ) frame .",
    "the aci frame is defined to be at rest with respect to the large - scale abell cluster bulk flow discovered by lp using the @xmath24-@xmath146 distance indicator .",
    "in fact , we did the analysis twice simultaneously , using both cmb and aci frame velocities to estimate  and galaxy luminosities .",
    "the same distance zero point was used in both analyses ; however , from one reference frame to the other , the relative distances between the galaxies change as a function of galactic coordinates , according to the transformation given by lp .",
    "table  [ tab : snsig_aci ] lists the  and @xmath3 results of our analysis in the aci frame .",
    "the quantities were derived in an identical manner to those shown in table  [ tab : snsig_cmb ] , but the aci frame velocities were used instead of cmb velocities .",
    "the  values are generally higher .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the coma - virgo distance is fixed , but the velocity of coma is nearly 10% smaller in the aci frame ( see table  [ tab : cls ] ) .    among the galaxies in clusters without fixed distances ( i.e. ,",

    "in addition , the mean and median gclf @xmath3 values among those with errors smaller than 0.15  mag are now @xmath149  mag and @xmath150  mag , respectively ; dropping the `` fixed point '' coma galaxies , these values increase to 1.51 and 1.53  mag .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : sigunc_aci ] . ) thus , unlike the results for @xmath3 in the cmb frame , which were discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : widths ] , we do not find good agreement between the values of @xmath3 in the aci frame and the @xmath127  mag width of the gclf  calibrator m87 .",
    "for these reasons , we have decided to concentrate the rest of the analysis on the results found using cmb frame velocities .",
    "the  values derived in the cmb frame are plotted below against various properties of the host galaxy and surrounding cluster . to prevent confusion ,",
    "we remind the reader that the word `` cluster '' , when it appears alone , means `` galaxy cluster '' ; the abbreviation `` gc '' refers to `` globular cluster . ''",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : sn_mag ] plots the derived @xmath1 values against absolute @xmath0-band cmb metric magnitude of the galaxy from lp .",
    "the lack of any significant correlation is understandable , as the lp metric magnitude is calculated within 12.5  kpc , while these @xmath1 values were derived for the total usable area of the galaxy within 40  kpc .",
    "therefore , in the lower panel of the figure we plot @xmath1 against the absolute @xmath130  magnitude ( since @xmath1 is defined relative to v magnitude ) of the region of each galaxy in which the plotted @xmath1 was derived . here , there does appear to be a weak correlation , but this is based almost entirely on the four faintest galaxies , which all have @xmath151 .",
    "overall , the significance of the correlation is @xmath50.95 , based on the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient , but excluding the four faintest galaxies causes the significance level to drop to @xmath50.40 ( i.e. , no correlation ) .",
    "galaxy luminosity is apparently not the driving force behind variations in  among these galaxies .",
    "the panels of figure  [ fig : sn_mag ] include the errorbars from table  [ tab : snsig_cmb ] , primarily to demonstrate their size , but the rest of the figures will omit them for the sake of clarity ( and because of the possibility of systematically overestimated random errors , discussed above ) .",
    "high values of  have been associated with the phenomenon of extended cd halos ( e.g. , harris 1991 , mclaughlin  1994 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sn_ext ] shows @xmath1 plotted against two measures of galaxy extent , the profile structure parameter  @xmath146 ( defined in ",
    "[ sec : sample ] ) , as listed by lp for the cmb frame , and the effective radius @xmath152 of the best fitting -law , taken from graham  ( 1996 ) , who tabulated this quantity for the bcgs in the cmb frame with @xmath153  mpc@xmath32 .",
    "where available , the effective radii for the non - bcgs were taken from the rc3 and brought into consistency with graham  via the effective radius of the bcg , tabulated by both sources .",
    "both panels exhibit a general upward trend .",
    "since @xmath146 measures the slope of the galaxy profile at fairly small radius , @xmath152 is probably a better measure of overall halo extent , but even with two apparent outliers , the top panel has less scatter .",
    "the biggest outlier in the @xmath146 plot is a539 - 1 ( with @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) ; this is not the dominant galaxy in a539 , judged by position relative to the cluster x - ray / dynamical center , although it does have many gcs .",
    "the other `` outlier '' is a2162 - 1 ( @xmath154 , @xmath156 ) , a cd whose extended halo only sets in at larger radius ; it begins to move into line with the more extended galaxies in the lower panel .",
    "although both plots show considerable scatter , they do support the view that  and galaxy extent are somehow associated .",
    "it is always advisable to look for systematic effects in final results ; therefore in figure  [ fig : sn_red ] we have plotted our derived  values against cluster redshift .",
    "these redshifts were the basis for our estimates and the galaxy luminosity calculations , but as the figure shows , they do not correlate with .",
    "we now consider possible correlations of  with properties of the clusters in which the galaxies reside .",
    "there are many different parameters to explore , including density , dynamics , morphology , and x - ray properties , any of which could have an effect on the gcs of the central galaxy in the cluster .",
    "correlations of @xmath1 with some of the properties reflecting cluster mass or density have been discussed by blakeslee ( 1997a ) , but here we provide a more complete discussion .",
    "we begin with the dynamics .    in collecting cluster velocity dispersions from the literature , one must take care to ensure that the final set is a fairly homogenous one .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that the various methods of estimating dispersions give consistent results as long as the number of cluster members with measured redshifts exceeds about 20 ; less sophisticated , or `` robust , '' analyses often yield erroneous results with fewer than 15 measured redshifts .",
    "this collection of dispersions , listed in table  [ tab : cls ] , started with the `` robust dispersions '' determined by girardi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) from the data sets of zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and yahil & vidal ( 1977 ) for cluster galaxies within @xmath157  mpc ( the abell radius , @xmath158 ) of the cluster centers .",
    "these dispersions have been superseded by the more recent measurements of beers  ( 1991 ) for a569 and zabludoff  ( 1993 ) for a1185 , a1367 , a1656 , and a2199 , both of whom likewise reported dispersions within @xmath159 .",
    "to these have been added the dispersions for a2634 and a2666 from scodeggio  ( 1995 ) , who conducted a detailed study of these possibly interacting clusters . because a2634 appears to be merging with a group of spirals at larger radius , and the smaller a2666",
    "would otherwise be heavily contaminated by nearby a2634 galaxies , the dispersions within half an abell radius have been used ; these should more accurately reflect the central potentials of these clusters .",
    "all of these dispersions are based on at least 22 cluster members with measured velocities ( after outliers have been rejected ) .",
    "finally , struble & rood ( 1991 ) list dispersions based on @xmath16020  member redshifts for three other clusters in the bcg sample , so these have been used as well .",
    "figure  [ fig : sn_disp]@xmath161 shows the resulting plot of @xmath1 against cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "the tight correlation evident in the figure indicates that bright galaxies in regions of higher dispersion , and thus deeper potential wells , have more gcs per unit luminosity .",
    "in this and most of the following figures , the more central galaxies ( judged by the x - ray center ) in the clusters with multiple members in this sample are the ones shown as filled symbols , while the less central ones are shown as open symbols , since they often deviate from the correlations .",
    "the non - central galaxies will be referred to as `` secondary '' , although three of the four are among the bcgs selected by lp , with the other one being ngc  4839 , the third ranked galaxy in coma .",
    "correlations among cluster richness , dispersion , and x - ray temperature are well established ( e.g. , bahcall 1981 ; mushotzsky 1984 ; edge & stewart 1991 ; lubin & bahcall 1993 ; girardi et al .",
    "1993 , 1996 ) and were to be expected as different measures of the cluster potential ( assuming galaxies trace mass ) .",
    "now we see a clear relationship between one of these quantities and something apparently unrelated , the gc specific frequency of the central bright galaxy in the cluster .",
    "recently , girardi and collaborators have been studying cluster velocity dispersion profiles ( fadda  1996 ; girardi  1996 ) , reporting the asymptotic values at large radii .",
    "they argue that `` asymptotic dispersions '' are less affected by small - scale velocity anisotropies , and thus more indicative of the depth of the cluster potential as a whole . because the profiles are usually peaked in the center before flattening further out , the asymptotic dispersions are generally lower than the central dispersions employed above .",
    "( these authors also cut the profiles of a2634 and a2666 off at smaller radii , however . ) for this reason , we separately plot the asymptotic cluster velocity dispersions , as listed by fadda , against @xmath1 in figure  [ fig : sn_disp]@xmath47 .",
    "the correlation is again very strong .",
    "figure  [ fig : sn_abell ] shows that the correlation between @xmath1 and galaxy density as measured by abell galaxy counts ( struble & rood 1987 ) is much weaker .",
    "the high formal significance of the correlation is due to the fact that the lowest  central galaxies are all in relatively poor clusters ; excluding these makes the correlation marginal .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the abell counts are large and not well - known .",
    "the number density of galaxies drops steeply out to the @xmath159 limit , resulting in a large amount of background contaminaton , and making the counts a questionable measure of central density ( beers & tonry  1986 ) .   bahcall ( 1981 ) showed that a better measure of the cluster density was provided by background - corrected counts of bright galaxies within @xmath162 .",
    "those counts correlated better with cluster dispersion and x - ray luminosity than did the abell counts .",
    "however , the present sample has very little overlap with the bahcall sample ; thus , we performed our own counts of bright galaxies within an even smaller radius , set by the size of the ccd field , making background correction completely unnecessary .",
    "we counted all galaxies brighter than 0.05 and 0.1  @xmath163 within several different radial distances from the program galaxy centers , where @xmath163 is the characteristic luminosity of the schechter ( 1976 ) function .",
    "the value of @xmath163 was taken from lin  ( 1996 ) and transformed from the @xmath164-band to our photometric bands following schneider  ( 1983 ) .",
    "the results of our counts are reported in table  [ tab : jbcounts ] which lists the number of neighbors @xmath165 brighter than 0.1  @xmath163 within 32 , 40 , and 50  and the number brighter than 0.05  @xmath163 within 32 and 40  .",
    "figure   plots the counts against .",
    "we are hampered by small number statistics , but it is clear that the galaxies surrounded by more neighbors , or in regions of greater galaxy density , tend to have higher .",
    "again a relationship is suggested between central location within the cluster and , assuming that the increase @xmath165 is the result of the galaxy s being closer to the cluster dynamical center .    moving on to morphology , we plot  against bautz - morgan type ( from abell  1989 ) and rood - sastry type ( struble & rood 1987 ) in figure  [ fig : sn_morph ] .",
    "there have been reports based on smaller data sets that central galaxy  correlates with bm type ( mclaughlin , harris , & hanes 1993 , 1994 ; harris , pritchet , & mcclure 1995 ) , in the sense of the `` later '' types ( ii - iii , iii ) having higher  central galaxies .",
    "the classification in this system is based on the relative dominance of the central galaxy in the cluster , with bm  i clusters being dominated by single giant galaxies , and bm  iii cluster having no clearly dominant galaxy .",
    "mclaughlin  ( 1993 ) suggested that the apparent anti - correlation of  with central galaxy dominance was due to dynamical evolution , with the central giants in the bm  i and i - ii clusters having diluted their originally high-  down to lower levels through repeated mergers with other galaxies in the cluster .",
    "it was an interesting suggestion , but we do see not see a correlation of  with bm type in this larger , more homogenous data set ; thus , we find no evidence that such  dilution is taking place .",
    "rood - sastry type is also usually thought of in evolutionary terms , with the evolutionary state becoming more advanced along the following morphological sequence : irregular , flattened , core - dominated , linear , binary , and cd .",
    "again , our immediate reaction is that no correlation exists between central galaxy  and rs type .",
    "however , schombert & west ( 1990 ) suggested that this classifications system reflected dynamical evolution only up to the l  class , with the b and cd classes ( clusters dominated by two giant galaxies and one giant galaxy , respectively ) representing further evolution of the galaxy luminosity function following cluster virialization .",
    "this suggestion was based on an apparent correlation of the i - f - c - l sequence with supercluster environment .",
    "it is conceivable that there is a systematic change of   along this subsequence of the rs system , but if so , it is most likely an ancillary consequence of the dependence central galaxy  on cluster density , seen most clearly in the correlations with velocity dispersion ( above ) and x - ray properties ( below ) .    from the correlation of  with cluster velocity dispersion found in figure  [ fig : sn_disp ] , and the known relation between cluster velocity dispersion and the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas ( e.g. , lubin & bahcall 1993 ) we expect some correlation between  and cluster x - ray properties .",
    "figures  [ fig : snxprops ] shows  plotted against cluster x - ray temperature @xmath166 ( kev ) and x - ray luminosity @xmath167 in the 0.54.5  kev band ( ergs  sec@xmath32 ) from jones & forman ( 1997 ) . while previous investigations found no correlations of  with these properties ( harris  1995 ; west  1995 ) , our larger , more homogeneous data set clearly shows that there is a correlation , with a high level of significance , @xmath50.998 .",
    "the scatter in these plots is larger than in the velocity dispersion plots , but that is at least partially due to the larger uncertainties in the x - ray temperatures . if the observed variation of  among these galaxies is driven by environmental density , then should correlate more strongly with @xmath166 than with @xmath167 because , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , the gas temperature is determined simply by the depth of the cluster gravitational potential while the luminosity also depends on the amount of gas present .",
    "these two plots look so similar because half of the temperatures were estimated from the cluster @xmath167-@xmath166 relation ( see table  [ tab : cls ] ) , and there will be definite scatter about this relation .",
    "these estimated temperatures have @xmath168 uncertainties of about 20% , while the uncertainties in the velocity dispersions used above are @xmath4110% .",
    "west  ( 1995 ) have revived the idea of `` intracluster globular clusters '' ( igcs ) which follow the overall cluster mass profile rather than being bound to individual galaxies . in this model ,",
    "a giant galaxy which happens to lie near the cluster center will appear to have a high  due to the `` excess '' intracluster gcs which become _ ipso facto _ associated with it .",
    "west  defined the excess to be the total number of gcs which elevate  above a value of 4 , and assumed that this will be proportional to the projected matter density at the distance @xmath164 from the cluster x - ray center . for hydrostatic equilibrium and an isothermal potential , the excess will be proportional to @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the core radius of the cluster . in figure",
    "[ fig : nexcess ] , we plot the gc excess , defined relative to @xmath171 , which more accurately reflects the lower  limit for our sample , against @xmath169 , where the @xmath170 values come from jones & forman . consistent with the igc model , we find a roughly linear relationship .",
    "even the non - central galaxies ( open symbols ) should follow this relationship , since it takes into account galaxy position in the cluster , and several of these galaxies do appear to deviate less than in the previous two plots , although otherwise there is no improvement . however ,",
    "blakeslee ( 1997a ) showed that @xmath1 correlated marginally better with `` local x - ray luminosity '' @xmath172 , than with @xmath167 itself .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the implications of the observed correlations , and non - correlations , for the various theoretical models .",
    "we then describe how the correlations found here improve our understanding of gc systems , and the mechanisms which effect  in abell cluster central galaxies .",
    "among the bright cluster galaxies in this sample , @xmath1 varies continously as a function of certain well - defined galaxy and cluster parameters .",
    "thus , the high-  galaxies do not constitute a special class of object , but rather occupy the high end of the  distribution .",
    "the total number of gcs appears to be determined primarily by cluster environmental factors , unlike the central galaxy luminosity , which is remarkably immune to variations in cluster properties ( e.g. , hoessel , gunn , & thuan 1980 ; pl ) .    as our results conflict with the common notion of `` normal '' and `` anomalous ''  systems",
    ", we give some consideration to the galaxies in the literature which have inspired it .",
    "we begin with the prototypical high-  galaxy m87 .",
    "the most recent determination of  for this galaxy was by mclaughlin  1994 , who reported a global value of @xmath173 , before taking into account uncertainties in the distance or gclf .",
    "those authors adopted the same distance as we have ; however , their fitted gclf parameters significantly disagree with those determined with hst ( whitmore  1995 ) .",
    "this is understandable , as the fitted gclf width and turnover are strongly correlated when the data do not go significantly fainter than @xmath13 .",
    "the much larger field of the mclaughlin  study makes their data preferable to hst for deriving , and they provided a correction factor , a function of the gclf parameters and distance modulus , that can be applied to their quoted . plugging the hst gclf results into their correction formula , we find @xmath174 .",
    "moreover ,  increases with radius in m87 , so its `` metric '' , as we report for our sample , should be smaller than this global value . thus , given the uncertainties , including the systematic error in the calibration of virgo to the cmb frame , we can only conclude that m87 is at the high end of the continuous distribution in  which we observe .",
    "the other well - studied galaxy that has been numbered among the high - systems is the fornax cd ngc  1399 .",
    "this galaxy was first reported to have @xmath175 ( bridges , hanes , & harris 1991 ) . a more recent study , using gclf parameter which agree with ours ( blakeslee & tonry 1996 ) found @xmath176 ( kissler - patig  1996 ) .",
    "however , this later study used a distance modulus that was 0.30  mag smaller than the new hst cepheid result for this cluster ( silberman  1996 ) .",
    "using the cepheid distance modulus ,  for this galaxy becomes ( n1399)@xmath177 . the gcs and halo light follow similar distributions , so the metric  would not differ much from the global value .",
    "this lies in the range of the galaxies studied here , though higher than we would expect for a cluster of low dispersion . on the other hand ,",
    "fornax is not a rich cluster ( showing up as s373 in the supplementary catalog of southern poor clusters of abell  [ 1989 ] ) , though it is very compact , so it is not clear how the  of its central galaxy should compare to those studied here .",
    "the rest of the high  values found in the literature generally scale with the  of m87 .",
    "for instance , harris  ( 1995 ) find 22@xmath1787 and 13@xmath1786 for the central cd galaxies in a2052 and a2107 ( both outside the redshift limit of our survey ; their other cluster , a2666 , is discussed below ) .",
    "these numbers were derived relative to an assumed m87 value of 15 ; using the value of 11 implied by the hst gclf yields ( a2052)@xmath179 and ( a2107)@xmath180 , which are both still high , but not even the a2052  can be called anomalous , given the uncertainties .",
    "direct comparisons between our results and literature values are possible for several galaxies . @xcite",
    "used rc2 photometry and reported global values of  which were in agreement with those found by harris ( 1987 ) , but we have revised those numbers down based on better photometry .",
    "in fact , harris also used rc2 photometry , so his  numbers get revised down in an identical manner ; in particular , his value for ngc 4874 becomes @xmath181 when rc3 photometry is used .",
    "butterworth & harris studied a1367 - 1 and reported the ratio ( a1367)/(m87 ) as a function of radius . reading the value of this ratio at our metric radius of @xmath518 , and using the m87  from above gives @xmath182 , very close to our value ; even if we had used the larger  of 14 for m87 , we would agree with their results within the errors . for a2666 - 1 ,",
    "harris  ( 1995 ) found @xmath183 , again assuming the  of 15 for m87 . using the smaller m87 value , their a2666 - 1 drops to @xmath52.2 . in either case , it is close to our value of 3.5 for this galaxy . finally , for the a2199 cd ngc  6166 , pritchet & harris ( 1990 ) reported @xmath151 , but a redetermination based on improved data found @xmath184 ( bridges  1996 ) .",
    "the latter result agrees with our value of @xmath1858.1 for this galaxy .    in summary , for the few cases in which direct comparisons are possible , our results are in good agreement with published values .",
    "however , we believe that our larger , more homogenous data set affords a clearer view of the overall picture .",
    "we find that there is a continuum of possible   values for bright cluster galaxies .",
    "where a galaxy falls in this continuum may even be predictable from the cluster velocity dispersion , or @xmath166 , and the projected distance of the galaxy from the cluster center .",
    "the observations presented here provide an unprecedented amount of information about  variation among central galaxies in rich clusters ; thus , we have the opportunity to evaluate the theoretical models from a more favorable vantage point than previously accessible .",
    "the history of gc formation theories is a long one , dating back at least to the work of peebles & dicke ( 1968 ) , but we will consider in turn only those extant models which purport to explain the wide variation of  among central galaxies in clusters . a good model may even guide our understanding of the observations .",
    "\\(1 ) initial conditions .  until now",
    ", it was thought that no obvious correlations existed between the  of the central cluster galaxy and other properties of either the galaxy or cluster ( west  1995 ) .",
    "for instance , harris et al .  ( 1995 ) , found no correlation of  with cluster x - ray properties in a data set composed of their three galaxies and others from the literature , including central galaxies in 4 more abell clusters , 3 awm and mkw poor clusters , fornax , and virgo .",
    "they interpreted their results as indicating that gc formation in central cluster galaxies occurred early on , and reflected local initial conditions , thus the lack of any correlations .",
    "this view , that modern galaxies with high values of  `` were special _ ab initio _ '' ( van den bergh 1984 ) and consequently formed their gcs `` superefficiently '' ( mclaughlin  1993 ) , we call the `` initial conditions '' scenario .",
    "it goes back to harris ( 1981 ) and is the prevailing view in the literature ( e.g. , harris 1991 ) .    in this scenario",
    "one must explain why some protogalaxies were privileged to undergo gc formation with enhanced efficiency .",
    "harris & pudritz ( 1994 ) constructed a model for gc formation out of primordial pressure - confined , self - gravitating , magnetized supergiant molecular clouds .",
    "they hypothesized that larger external pressures may have prevailed in the proto - halos of cd galaxies and caused the primordial clouds in their model to fragment into more proto - gc cores per unit cloud mass .",
    "this idea remains speculative . in any case ,",
    "our data indicate that many of the reasons for invoking initial conditions are no longer valid . in particular ,",
    "it is _ not _ true that there are no correlations of  with cluster properties .",
    "we find very good correlations between  and cluster x - ray properties and with cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "thus , we do not believe that the central galaxies in our study formed their gcs `` superefficiently '' as a result of local initial conditions .",
    "\\(2 ) biasing .",
    "a similarly motivated , but fundamentally different model is that of `` biased gc formation . ''",
    "this is the apparent heir of the early work by peebles & dicke , the major addition being that of dark matter .",
    "examples of this include the models of peebles ( 1984 ) and west ( 1993 ) . in the biasing scenario",
    ", gc formation depends only on the height of the local density fluctuations with respect to some universal threshold .",
    "when the small scale ( pc - sized ) fluctuations are superposed on a larger scale ( mpc - sized ) , low amplitude fluctuation , such as might eventually evolve into a cluster of galaxies , the small scale fluctuations are more likely to broach this universal threshold ; thus , they have a `` bias '' working in their favor .",
    "biased formation may even produce gcs outside of any particular protogalaxy , with the resulting intergalactic gcs becoming associated with the whole of the cluster that forms there .",
    "thus , the biasing model is also primordial , but less `` local '' than the initial conditions model .",
    "it predicts that  should correlate strongly with the present - day density of the local environment , as we observe , but we are biased against this model because it is largely unconstrained .",
    "biasing has been proposed as a possible mechanism at work in the igc model discussed below ; we will come back to it .",
    "\\(3 ) mergers .  in this model , gas - rich galaxies with low  values , spirals in particular ,",
    "merge to form elliptical galaxies , as suggested by toomre ( 1977 ) . in the process , gcs form out of shocked gas clouds , increasing the value of  with every merger by an amount proportional to the available gas ( ashman & zepf 1992 ; schweizer 1987 ) .",
    "repeated mergers of such systems in the core of a galaxy cluster might then yield high values of .",
    "kumai  ( 1993a , b ) have discussed mechanisms for creating gcs in gas - rich collisions .    while mergers do indeed occur and massive star clusters may form in the process ( e.g. , holtzman 1992 ) ,",
    "the question we must address is whether or not the observed variations in  among central galaxies in clusters can be explained in this way . as formulated ( ashman & zepf 1992 ; zepf & ashman 1993 ) , the merger model predicts a strong dependence of  on galaxy luminosity , which we do not see , while we do see other correlations which are not obvious in this picture .",
    "thus , we do not believe that mergers of modern day galaxies can explain the observations .",
    "however , mergers of gaseous fragments in the protogalactic era , consistent with hierarchical structure formation models , almost certainly played a role in determining , as we discuss in  [ sec : mymodel ] .",
    "\\(4 ) stripping .",
    "the idea that the central galaxy in the cluster potential increases its  through preferential tidal stripping of the gcs from other galaxies in the cluster goes back to forte , martinez , & muzzio ( 1982 ) .",
    "muzzio ( 1987 ) reviewed the early work done on modeling such gcs dynamical evolution .",
    "since the gc populations of elliptical galaxies tend to be more extended than the halo light ( e.g. harris 1991 ) , a central galaxy might increase its  through this process ; @xcite noted that the number of gcs donated by other galaxies would not be unreasonable .",
    "the observed strong correlation of central galaxy  with cluster velocity dispersion might occur as a result of stripping , since the crossing time in high dispersion clusters is lower and each galaxy would have passed through the core more times ( although higher velocities also make stripping less efficient ) .",
    "moreover , the correlations with local galaxy density and location of the galaxy relative to the cluster center are both easily understandable in the context of this model .",
    "one problem is that the increase of  for the central cluster galaxy was too slow in the simulations reviewed by muzzio ( 1987 ) to explain the observations .",
    "more modern simulations would be desirable . stripping in the context of the igc model",
    "is discussed below .",
    "\\(5 ) intracluster globular clusters ( igcs ) .",
    "the igc model of west  ( 1995 ) , mentioned above when we examined correlations of  with cluster properties , simply proposes that there are large populations of gcs that belong to the cluster as a whole and follow the overall cluster density in their distribution .",
    "west  suggested stripping and biasing as possibilities for the origin of the igcs .",
    "as stated previously , our results appear consistent with the prediction of the igc model that the number of gcs in excess of @xmath1864 should correlate with @xmath169 .",
    "west predicted that the  values of two of our sample galaxies , a569 - 1 and a779 - 1 , would be relatively low , @xmath1864 , as we find in both cases .",
    "we believe that the igc model is on the right track in treating the gc populations of the central galaxies as more a property of the cluster itself than of the galaxy .",
    "however , in order to clump around the galaxy , the igcs must have a velocity dispersion closer to the internal dispersion of the galaxy ( @xmath5300 ) than of the cluster ( @xmath5750 ) .",
    "this is observed to be the case for m87 where the dispersion of the gcs is @xmath5400  ( cohen & ryzhov 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , the origin of the igcs remains problematic .",
    "biasing suffers the problems endemic to dark matter models in general , namely the lack of any useful external constraints .",
    "the alternative mechanism of stripping qualitatively explains our observations , but may not be efficient enough to produce large igc populations .",
    "therefore , it is not clear that the gcs are truly intergalactic ; what we mean by saying that they are `` more a property of the cluster '' is that their number is determined by cluster properties , not by the properties of the central  galaxy .",
    "we conclude that no clear winner has emerged from among the available models , although there have been some strong contenders . in the following section we use as an additional guide the observationally known properties of the bcgs themselves . along with",
    "the insight gained from our observations and this discussion , i.e. , that the central galaxy gcs are more rightly considered a cluster property , we attempt to reach a coherent understanding of the observed variations in .      discussions about why only certain central galaxies in clusters have `` anomalously '' high values of  usually revolve around the presence of a cd envelope , which appears to be a helpful but not sufficient condition for having a high . in an effort to uncover further clues in this regard , we extend the discussion to include another remarkable property of central cluster galaxies , namely their uniformity .",
    "sandage ( 1972 ) was the first to exploit the small dispersion in the metric luminosities @xmath24 of brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "he reported that @xmath24 defined within @xmath520  had a dispersion of only 0.25  mag for bcgs and was independent of cluster richness .",
    "hoessel , gunn , & thuan ( 1980 ) studied a larger , unbiased sample of bcgs and found an intrinsic dispersion of mag for @xmath24 defined within a 10 .",
    "they also found that @xmath24 did become slightly brighter on average with cluster richness .",
    "hoessel ( 1980 ) showed that this trend also correlated with the structure parameter @xmath146 , the slope of the luminosity profile at the metric radius .",
    "he defined the @xmath24-@xmath146 distance indicator , which had no residual dependence on richness .",
    "as oegerle & hoessel ( 1991 ) showed , this indicator gives distances for bcgs that are nearly as good as fundamental plane distances but much less expensive observationally .",
    "most recently , lauer & postman ( lp 1994 ; pl 1995 ) have reinvestigated the use of the bcg @xmath24-@xmath146 distance indicator for a sample of 119 bcgs , from which our own sample was selected .",
    "pl find that the intrinsic dispersion in @xmath24 drops from 0.33 mag to 0.24 mag after the @xmath146 correction has been applied , and residuals about the @xmath24-@xmath146 relation show no dependence on bcg luminosity , color , or location , nor on cluster richness .",
    "moreover , they report that @xmath24 is independent of cluster richness even before the @xmath146 correction has been applied .",
    "( although hudson & ebeling [ 1997 ] find evidence that both @xmath24 and residuals from the @xmath24-@xmath146 indicator correlate with cluster x - ray luminosity . )",
    "they conclude that the small scatter in @xmath24 and @xmath187 color , coupled with the lack of any second - parameter effects , make bcgs `` the most homogeneous distance indicators presently available for large - scale structure research . ''",
    "in contrast to the uniformity of bcg metric luminosity , the  values of bcgs have a range of more than a factor of three and are strongly correlated with cluster density as measured by velocity dispersion , x - ray temperature , and local galaxy density . taken together ,",
    "these points imply that high-  bcgs are not anomalously rich in gcs , rather , they are underluminous with regard to their preeminent positions at the centers of rich clusters , while the numbers of gcs accurately reflect the dense environments .    to illustrate this view , figure  [ fig : discuss]@xmath161 plots absolute magnitudes within 40 kpc ( excluding galaxy center , as in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : sn_mag ] ) against cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "there is a general trend , but the intrinsic scatter is large ( the uncertainty in @xmath129 is @xmath50.1  mag ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : discuss]@xmath47 , we show `` gc excess '' ( the number of gcs which elevate  above a value of 3.5 ) plotted against cluster dispersion . despite the larger observational uncertainty ,",
    "the scatter is much smaller , and the only discrepant points are non - central galaxies . dividing the smoothly varying gc excesses in figure  [ fig : discuss]@xmath47 by the relatively invariant luminosities in figure  [ fig : discuss]@xmath161 ( and adding 3.5 ) results in the observed correlations of  with cluster density .",
    "the correlation of  with @xmath146 ( figure  [ fig : sn_ext ] ) can then be seen as a consequence of the fact that @xmath146 itself correlates with cluster density ( blakeslee 1997a ) .",
    "these observations might be explained by a model in which the gcs of these galaxies , like those of the milky way , formed early on and in proportion to the available mass . a later process , perhaps the collapse of the surrounding cluster , then halted the luminosity growth of the central galaxy .",
    "if this is true , then the number of gcs per unit total `` background '' ( cluster ) mass interior to a projected radius @xmath0 provides a more accurate description of the gc formation process than does the number per unit luminosity ( i.e. , ) . we will attempt to estimate the cluster mass within 40 kpc , and so derive the number of gcs per unit mass , a quantity we call @xmath2 , for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the surface mass density near the center of a nonsingular isothermal sphere is @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the cluster velocity dispersion , and @xmath170 is the core radius .",
    "if @xmath170 were the same for all clusters , or were completely uncorrelated with @xmath189 , then the mass enclosed within a fixed radius would go simply as the square of the velocity dispersion .",
    "however , there is a rough relationship between @xmath189 and @xmath170 , in the sense that clusters with larger core radii tend to have higher velocity dispersions . because of the difficulty in accurately measuring @xmath170 and the fact that a quarter of our clusters with known dispersions lack @xmath170 values , we will make use of this relationship . a straight fit for our sample gives @xmath190 , where @xmath170 is in kpc , @xmath189 is in , and the scatter is about 50% . using this relation , we get the following expression for the total mass enclosed within 40  kpc of the central galaxy @xmath191 dividing the observed number of gcs within 40 kpc by the mass implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : isosig ] ) yields the ratio @xmath192 , which we plot against cluster velocity dispersion in figure  [ fig : ngc_disp ] .",
    "the figure demonstrates that @xmath2 calculated according to this simple mass model is constant .",
    "the average value is about 0.7  per 10@xmath193 , with a scatter of @xmath530% .",
    "thus , there appears to have been a single , universal formation efficiency for the gcs in our sample . for 10@xmath194 gcs ,",
    "the implied efficiency would be @xmath60.1% . another way to describe",
    "the situation is to note that the observed @xmath101 goes approximately as @xmath195 .",
    "because we wish to avoid models which postulate dark matter biasing or a density dependent efficiency , we hypothesize that the production of gcs per unit mass is constant .",
    "finally , we have shown that a simple , plausible mass model produces the desired result .",
    "we have studied the largest sample to date of gc populations around central galaxies in abell clusters , 7  times larger than any previous single study .",
    "the primary factor which allowed us to study such a large sample with a relatively small telescope was our use of the analysis methods developed by @xcite .",
    "our sample was selected from the bcg survey of lauer & postman ( 1994 ) ; nearly all the new observations were made in the @xmath0-band , the one exception being that of a2199 . for several clusters ,",
    "the second brightest galaxy was included because it was comparable to the bcg in luminosity .",
    "in fact , in all of these cases , the second brightest galaxy was also more centrally located , as judged by both position relative to the x - ray center and the local galaxy density .",
    "in addition , a third coma galaxy , ngc 4839 ( a1656 - 3 ) , was included by virtue of its cd envelope .",
    "we detected a gc system and presented a measurement of the gclf width @xmath3 for each sample galaxy .",
    "a slight bias was found in the poorly constrained values of @xmath3 , but the more tightly constrained values showed little intrinsic dispersion and agreed closely with those found from deep imaging of nearby ellipticals , particularly m87 , which was used as our ``  calibrator . '' we noted that our technique , as well as previous studies which used only direct counts , relied to some degree on the predictability of the gclf turnover magnitude .",
    "that is , the frequently made , but poorly tested , assumption of a universal gclf is an important input .",
    "thus , our gclf results confirm the working assumption of a universal gclf for central galaxies in the cores of rich clusters .",
    "to limit biased comparisons of  among sample galaxies , we assumed a single value of @xmath3 , consistent with our data , and calculated metric values of , defined within 40  kpc .",
    "our results for followed a continuous distribution ; they were not segregated into `` normal '' and `` high '' , or `` anomalous '' , classes .",
    "this was the first time in which a continuum of  values was clearly shown to exist .",
    "contrary to the results of other studies , we find that correlates well with properties of the galaxy clusters , particularly central and asymptotic velocity dispersions , but also x - ray luminosity and temperature and the local galaxy density .",
    "for clusters with multiple galaxies in our sample , the one with the higher  value was always the one which was more extended and closer to the cluster x - ray center .",
    "we did not find a strong correlation with cluster richness expressed in abell counts , but that is not surprising , given their fairly qualitative and uncertain nature .",
    "we found no evidence of a previously proposed correlation of central galaxy  with bautz - morgan class , and there is no obvious correlation with rood - sastry type either .",
    "we discussed several models which have been proposed to explain the   values of central cluster galaxies .",
    "our data confirmed some predictions of the `` intracluster globular cluster '' ( igc ) model , but the lack of a viable mechanism for producing the igcs was judged problematic .",
    "the stripping model appeared most consistent with our data , but it may require an unacceptably long time scale for adding gcs to the central galaxy .",
    "we concluded by offering our own explanation for the behavior of  in these galaxies .",
    "we suggested that the gcs formed early , with their number @xmath101 scaling in proportion to the available mass .",
    "( we do not exclude the possibility that their formation may have been episodic , yielding the frequently observed complex color / metallicity distributions . ) the galaxy luminosity , on the other hand , is relatively independent of the cluster mass ; perhaps the bcg formation was punctuated by the growth of the surrounding cluster in such a way as to produce the observed `` standard candle '' quality of these galaxies . in any case",
    ", the result is that , the ratio of @xmath101 to galaxy luminosity , is observed to scale with cluster mass in the same way as @xmath101 itself does .    a better diagnostic of the physical processes affecting gc formation",
    "should therefore be provided by the observed number of gcs per unit `` background '' mass , a quantity which we have called @xmath196 . to estimate it",
    ", we adopted a simple flat core model and used it to calculate the total mass within the volume occupied by the gcs .",
    "we showed that the resulting @xmath196 for our sample of galaxies was constant in this model .",
    "the implied `` universal '' formation efficiency is @xmath61  gc per 10@xmath197 .",
    "thus , we believe that a consistent picture of the gc systems of central galaxies in clusters has begun to emerge , although further observational and theoretical work is needed in order to verify these results .",
