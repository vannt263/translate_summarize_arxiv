    "its spectrum is dominated by nonthermal continuum well described by synchrotron emission from a power - law electron distribution with an exponential cutoff ( paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "our 237-ks _ chandra _ observation in july 2009 showed conclusively thermal emission from ejecta from the north rim ( near the radio , but not the x - ray , maximum ) , with strong line emission from intermediate - mass elements ( imes ) such as si and s , as well as from fe @xcite .",
    "in addition , we found evidence for emission from @xmath6sc , produced by the radioactive decay of @xmath6ti .    only the outermost ejecta layers with free - expansion velocities in excess of 18,000 km s@xmath2 have been shocked so far in this very dynamically - young snr @xcite .",
    "the presence of fe at such high velocities is surprising , since few sne show such high - velocity fe ( or @xmath4ni ) .",
    "the spatial distribution , abundances , and physical properties of ejecta are key for understanding the explosion mechanism in this likely type ia snr .",

    "first , this cube was denoised using the spectro - spatial method of @xcite . smoothed images at low , medium , and high energies were extracted from a more heavily denoised data cube containing all 2011 observations , and combined into a color image ( figure [ 2xim ] ) .",
    "spectral variations are apparent , with the bright e and w lobes noticeably harder than the much fainter s and n rims , confirming azimuthal variations in the synchrotron spectra ( paper iii ) .    in our search for spectral lines within this cube , we used a continuous wavelet transform method to spatially localize ejecta emission .",

    "in order to reduce the effects of noise , maps of estimated line strengths were examined for spatially contiguous regions of potential line emission .",

    "unlike the latter , estimated parameter values and their errors obtained with mcmc methods do not suffer systematic biases , and are more reliable .",
    "in particular , comparison with the fwhm value of 12,000 ( 8100 , 18,000 ) km s@xmath2 for the inner n rim from table [ lineflux ] suggests that some ( or all ) line widths listed there slightly underestimate true line widths .",

    "we can thereby infer that the systematic line shifts for various regions seen in table [ lineflux ] are mostly caused by bulk motions , though ionization effects may still play a role .    in the vpshock fit to the inner n rim spectrum",
    ", the x - ray continuum is produced by free - free emission on protons and @xmath3 particles , and we set the abundances of ar and ca equal to s. strongly oversolar abundances of si , s , and fe confirm that emission lines are produced by sn ejecta .",

    "this discrepancy suggests that the assumption that the continuum is thermal is incorrect ; given a nonthermal continuum , it is likely that pure heavy - element ejecta , without any h or he , produce the lines seen in figure [ spec4 ] . this makes si , s , and fe ems somewhat uncertain , particularly for fe if plasma temperatures are significantly higher than 3.2 kev . as an example ,",
    "a fit to the inner n rim with a power - law model and a plane shock model with an assumed temperature of 10 kev and without any h or he gives ems of @xmath32 @xmath15 @xmath29 for the imes , and @xmath33 @xmath15 @xmath29 for fe .",

    "the presence of shocked heavy - element ejecta in is surprising , since all ejecta that have been shocked so far were expelled by the sn with velocities exceeding @xmath41 km s@xmath2 ( paper v ) . in particular , fe ( or @xmath4ni ) is not commonly found at such high velocities in sn spectra , except for unusually energetic type ia sne and rare core - collapse ( cc ) hypernovae . in , fe is prominent only in the northern rim , not in the western rim where only si and s lines have been detected , implying a strongly asymmetric sn explosion .",
    "there is no evidence for any jet - like features expected in jet - triggered energetic cc sne , and other considerations ( paper i ) also favor a type ia origin , so in the following discussion we focus on type ia explosions",
    ".    studies of high - velocity fe - group elements in type ia sn spectra are rare since they require frequent acquisition of optical and uv spectra soon after the sn explosion .",

    "high - velocity ( up to 18,000 km s@xmath2 ) @xmath4ni is present in only one of a dozen 3d delayed - detonation models of @xcite . in this model ( n3 ) , deflagrations were initiated in only 3 central locations within the white dwarf ( wd ) , producing a strongly asymmetric and energetic explosion that synthesized nearly @xmath66 of @xmath4ni .",
    "all explosions with a small number of ignition kernels resulted in energetic explosions , but fast - moving ( @xmath67 km s@xmath2 ) @xmath4ni is present only in models n3 and n5 . in both models , part of a deflagration plume",
    "had already risen to the surface of the wd when the first delayed detonation occurred .",
    "the outermost deflagration ashes present within this plume were then accelerated to high velocities by the sn shock wave .",
    "might have been produced by such an explosion .",
    "the strongly asymmetric distribution of fe in supports this hypothesis , since it is in qualitative agreement with the asymmetric distribution of @xmath4ni in the n3 model .",
    "( the absence of strong azimuthal variations in expansion rate ( paper v ) disfavors an external density gradient as an alternative explanation . )",
    "the ejecta emission in appears stronger than expected in the heuristic sn  2010jn model of @xcite .",
    "one weakness of that model is the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "the sn explosion could have been strongly asymmetric , as in the n3 model or in the gravitationally - confined detonation models of @xcite where the density profiles are much steeper in the direction of the off - center detonation site than on the other side of the wd , leading to an order of magnitude variation in density of high - velocity ejecta .",
    "this could explain the lack of perfect agreement between predictions based on the heuristic model of @xcite for sn  2010jn and _ chandra _ observations of .",
    "the heavy - element ejecta in the northern and western rims of were probably several times denser than in the spherically - symmetric ws15dd3 model , perhaps because of their location opposite to the off - center detonation site .",
    "the coincidence of the radio maximum with a region of substantial fe suggests the possibility of a contribution to the radio flux from positrons from the decay of @xmath4co injected into the shock - acceleration process with initial energies of @xmath68 1 mev .",
    "20% of @xmath4co decays produce a positron @xcite ; the @xmath69 of initial @xmath4ni we infer from the inner n rim will eventually produce a total of @xmath70 positrons .",
    "however , those injected at early times will lose energy in the dense ejecta due to ionization losses ; once thermalized , they will rapidly annihilate .",
    "@xcite estimate the slowing - down time for positrons emitted at time @xmath71 as @xmath72 yr , with @xmath73 in @xmath29 .",
    "then positrons emitted earlier than @xmath74 given by @xmath75 will annihilate .",
    "for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath78 yr .",
    "given the 111 d mean life of @xmath4co , an insignificant fraction of positrons is expected to survive to late times , unless they are accelerated first .",
    "the observed radio flux from the inner n rim is about 150 mjy at 1.4 ghz ; assuming a spectral index of 0.62 ( paper iii ) and a power - law distribution of electrons down to a minimum lorentz factor of 10 , standard synchrotron formulae give @xmath79 where nonlinear shock amplification would be required to reach magnetic field strengths of order 100 @xmath80 g . for",
    "this value , all positrons emitted after about 300 days would need to survive and be accelerated .",
    "this seems exceptionally unlikely .",
    "we conclude that decay positrons can not account for the radio maximum in the n rim ; further radio observations under way may cast light on this issue",
    ".    offers us a unique view of the outermost , strongly asymmetric fe - rich ejecta of a likely type ia snr .",
    "their spatial distribution should allow for distinguishing among various type ia explosion models .",
    "energetic delayed - detonation models are promising candidates as they may account for both the observed asymmetry and the presence of high - velocity fe . the delayed - detonation n3 model of @xcite produces asymmetric ejecta rich in fe - group elements , although not at high enough free - expansion velocities .",
    "high - velocity radioactive @xmath4ni affects early - time type ia sn light curves @xcite .",
    "its highly asymmetric spatial distribution , as observed in and obtained in recent 3d type ia simulations such as the n3 model , should be taken into account when interpreting light curves and spectra of type ia sne .",
    "future 3d hydrodynamical simulations of asymmetric type ia explosions , including additional delayed - detonation models , followed by modeling of their collision with the ambient ism , would be most helpful for understanding the most recent known sn explosion in our galaxy .",
    "such strongly asymmetric explosions are expected to produce azimuthal variations in expansion rate that can be measured with future _ chandra _ and vla observations . in a broader context , studies of this and other young type ia snrs that show large - scale asymmetries in their fe - rich ejecta distribution ( e.g. , sn 1006 and kepler s snr , * ? ? ?",
