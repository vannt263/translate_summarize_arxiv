    "<S> this is consistent with recent theoretical calculations , which demonstrated that the radiative lifetime of an individual emitter is marginally modified in the vicinity of graphene  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the following , we will consider that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the ret rate and @xmath32 is the reference decay rate measured in the absence of graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> similar measurements were repeated on more than 100 ncs and nps deposited on bare graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we found similar statistically averaged quenching factors of approximately 50 for ncs and nps . </S>",
    "<S> overall , for @xmath33 of the investigated single ncs and nps , the ret efficiency , defined as @xmath34 is found to be larger than @xmath33 .    [ </S>",

    "<S> the reference decay rate @xmath36 is the statistically averaged decay rate of ncs and nps measured on a bare @xmath37 thick film of mgo . </S>",
    "<S> the results for ncs and nps are summarized in figures [ fig04 ] and [ fig05 ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> each point corresponds to a statistical average over @xmath38 to @xmath39 single ncs , and over more than @xmath40 single nps , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical error bars correspond to the standard deviations , while the horizontal error bars account for the roughness of the mgo film . for both nc and nps </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that the measured decay rate decreases significantly , when increasing the thickness of the mgo film . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown in figures [ fig04]c and [ fig05]c , the product @xmath41 varies by less than a factor of 2 and , considering the standard deviations associated with each distribution , can be considered as constant . </S>",
    "<S> this generalizes the conclusions drawn from the analysis of figures  [ fig02 ] and  [ fig03 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> a key observation is that the decrease of the pl decay rate as function of the mgo thickness is seemingly steeper for ncs than for nps ( see also figure 7 in the supporting information for a comparison of the normalized decay rates ) . </S>",
    "<S> this points towards the effect of dimensionality on ret , which we now discuss . </S>",
    "<S> let us first focus on the case of ncs interacting with graphene . </S>",
    "<S> based on the well known @xmath42 distance dependence of the frster energy transfer rate between two point - like dipoles  @xcite , one would expect the measured decay rate to scale as @xmath43,\\ ] ] where the distance @xmath0 separating the nanoemitter from the graphene layer is @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , the thickness of the mgo film and @xmath46 , the minimal distance between the center of the nanoemitter and the graphene surface in the absence of a mgo spacer , where @xmath47 characterizes the ret efficiency , and @xmath48 is related to the dimensionality of the donor and acceptor </S>",
    "<S> . a straightforward extension of frster s theory would then give @xmath49 for a zero - dimensional emitter interacting with a two - dimensional assembly of independent dipoles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for ncs ( see fig .  [ fig04]b , using @xmath49 , we obtain a good fit with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter value is slightly larger than the average physical radius of the ncs , which is consistent with a possible contribution from the surrounding ligands and residual adsorbates to @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> although a fit based on eq.[eqret1 ] is in good agreement with our measurements , one has to recall that eq.[eqret1 ] overlooks the fact that graphene is a two - dimensional system with extended , delocalized electronic wavefunctions and a well defined electronic dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the ret rate @xmath52 from a single point - like dipole to graphene has been extensively studied theoretically in recent years  @xcite and can be written as  @xcite    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the transferred momentum , @xmath55 is the largest transferable momentum , @xmath56 is the wavelength of the emitted photons , @xmath57 is the speed of light and @xmath58 is the fermi velocity in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to far - field emission and absorption processes , the ret process described by eq.[eqret0d ] involves a finite momentum transfer ( see figure  [ fig01]a ) , which is on the order of @xmath59 . for neutral graphene , and distances such that @xmath60 , the denominator of the integrand in eq.[eqret0d ] , which originates from the ( momentum dependent ) optical conductivity of graphene  @xcite , only gives significant contributions for @xmath61 ( quasi - vertical transitions ) , and </S>",
    "<S> can thus be approximated as a constant . in these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> graphene can be treated as a two - dimensional assembly of incoherent point - like dipoles , and eq.[eqret0d ]  simplifies as @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it must be emphasized that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqret0d ] applies to a point - like donor , while in our case , the ncs have a finite radius , larger than the thinnest mgo films ( @xmath63 ) deposited here . </S>",
    "<S> however , the surrounding ligands and the finite thickness of the cds shell of our cdse / cds ncs warrant that there is a minimal distance of a few nanometers between the graphene layer and the emitting cdse core . </S>",
    "<S> we will therefore consider that the _ long distance _ </S>",
    "<S> approximation is valid and neglect the finite size of the ncs and nps . considering random relative dipole orientation , we obtain  @xcite @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the fine structure constant </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath66 is the effective dielectric constant ( at @xmath56 ) of the surrounding medium and @xmath67 is a screening factor  @xcite . using @xmath68 results in @xmath69 , in good agreement with our measurements .        </S>",
    "<S> we now address the distance dependence of the ret rate from single nps to graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the nps cores are atomically smooth and have recently been shown to behave as genuine quantum wells  @xcite . as a result , a different regime of ret is anticipated when a two - dimensional donor is involved . </S>",
    "<S> electronic states in nps are described by extended wave functions that are coherent over large distances in the np plane . however , at finite temperature , one has to consider , in a photoexcited np , a thermal distribution of excitons with different in - plane center of mass momentum . besides , since the thickness of the np shell is on the order of @xmath70 , there is a minimal separation between the np core and graphene , such that the approximation @xmath71 holds ( _ i.e. _ , graphene can also be treated as an incoherent plane of point - like - dipoles ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar situations have been previously modeled by basko _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and kos _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for hybrid systems composed of quantum wells transferring energy to an assembly ( thick film or monolayer ) of point - like dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated ret rate writes @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the de broglie thermal length , with @xmath74 the planck constant , @xmath75 the boltzmann constant and @xmath76 the mass of the lowest energy heavy hole exciton ( @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the free electron mass ) in cdse  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this expression applies to free excitons in an infinite quantum well , with thickness @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of free excitons is consistent with the reported low density of trapping sites of cdse - based core / shell nps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , since the typical lateral dimensions of our nps ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) exceed @xmath82 ( at room temperature , @xmath83 ) , finite size effects can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus attempted to fit the data in figure  [ fig05]b using the expression @xmath84 . a good agreement with our experimental results </S>",
    "<S> is obtained using @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> again , the latter value is consistent with the thickness of the core and shell of the nps and includes a minor contribution from the surrounding ligands and residual adsorbates .    </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the limiting cases of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqret2d ] provides a rationale for the observed scaling . in the short distance limit , @xmath86 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath87 becomes independent on the distance and is determined by the thermal cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the large distance ( or high temperature ) limit , @xmath88 and @xmath89 follows a @xmath1 scaling , as expected in the case of a two - dimensional assembly of incoherent point - like dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> since , at room temperature , @xmath82 falls exactly in our measurement range , we expect the ret rate to decay more smoothly than @xmath1 for @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed observed experimentally ( see fig  [ fig05]b ) , since a scaling based on eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqret0d ] , with @xmath49 and @xmath91 , having asymptotic behavior for large @xmath0 as our fit based on eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqret2d ] , would predict a higher @xmath28 in the short distance limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in figure  [ fig05 ] suggest that even at room temperature , the distance scaling of the ret rate from an extended donor ( such as a two - dimensional np ) to graphene exhibits , as expected theoretically , a slight deviation from a simple power law . following eq.[eqret2d ] , this deviation is expected to be more prominent at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> thus , further investigations of the distance and temperature dependence of the ret rate for various np architectures could provide insights into the dimensionality of excitons in these novel systems  @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , frster - type resonant energy transfer dramatically affects the photophysics of semiconductor nanostructures absorbed on graphene . in spite of its atomic thinness , a single layer of graphene typically quenches more than @xmath92 of the luminescence of individual nanocrystals or nanoplatelets . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of well - defined distance scalings of the resonant energy transfer rate suggests that novel graphene - based molecular rulers can be engineered using semiconductor nanostructures with different size , shape , and dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> this is a promising development , especially for biological research . </S>",
    "<S> finally , with the prospect of designing hybrid opto - electronic devices , we show that graphene can very efficiently harvest energy from photoexcited semiconductor nanostructures , which is of interest for photodetection . </S>",
    "<S> a major challenge is now to dissociate the electron - hole excitations generated in graphene before their fast relaxation into heat  @xcite .    </S>",
