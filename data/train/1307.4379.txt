    "<S> we show that a fluid dynamical scenario describes quantitatively the observed mass splitting of the elliptical flow coefficients @xmath0 for pions , kaons , and protons . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a strong argument in favor of the existence of a fluid dynamical expansion in ppb collisions at 5tev .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the strongest signals of collective flow in heavy ion collisions is the fact that the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptical flow coefficient @xmath0 ( measuring the azimuthal asymmetry ) depends in a very characteristic way on the mass of the observed hadrons . this has been predicted @xcite and impressively confirmed experimentally later @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> can we also `` prove '' the existence of flow in small systems like proton - lead collisions , where such a collective behavior has not been expected ?    </S>",
    "<S> information about flow asymmetries can be obtained via studying two particle correlations as a function of the pseudorapidity difference @xmath1 and the azimuthal angle difference @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> so - called ridge structures ( very broad in @xmath1 ) have been observed first in heavy ion collisions , later also in pp @xcite and very recently in ppb collisions @xcite . in case of heavy ions , these structures appear naturally in models employing a hydrodynamic expansion , in an event - by - event treatment .    to clearly pin down the origin of such structures in small systems , one needs to consider identified particles . in the fluid dynamical scenario , where particles are produced in the local rest frame of fluid cells characterized by transverse velocities , large mass particles ( compared to low mass ones ) are pushed to higher transverse momenta , visible in @xmath3 distributions , but also in the dihadron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> both effects are clearly seen in experimental data . in this paper , we focus on dihadron correlations and the @xmath0 coefficients .    the following discussion is based on alice results on dihadron correlations @xcite and epos3 simulations . </S>",
    "<S> epos3 is a major update of the work described in @xcite ( epos2 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , we introduced a theoretical scheme which accounts for hydrodynamically expanding bulk matter , jets , and the interaction between the two . </S>",
    "<S> the whole transverse momentum range is covered , from very low to very high @xmath3 . in @xcite , we show that this approach can accommodate spectra of jets with @xmath3 up to 200 gev / c in @xmath4 scattering at 7 tev , as well as particle yields and harmonic flows with @xmath3 between 0 and 20 gev / c in pbpb collisions at 2.76 tev . to our knowledge , this is the only model able to describe the famous lambda to kaon enhancement correctly over the whole @xmath3 range . </S>",
    "<S> new features of epos3 are : an event - by - event 3d+1 viscous hydrodynamical evolution , and a new treatment of high parton densities , via an individual parton saturation scale @xmath5 for each elementary scattering . </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding final state partonic system amounts to ( usually two ) color flux tubes , being mainly longitudinal , with transversely moving pieces carrying the @xmath3 of the partons from hard scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> these flux tubes constitute eventually both bulk matter , also referred to as `` core '' ( which thermalizes , flows , and finally hadronizes ) and jets ( also refereed to as `` corona '' ) , according to some criteria based on the energy of the string segments and the local string density .    in p - pb collisions , </S>",
    "<S> the `` violence '' of a collision is no longer characterized by the impact parameter , but by the multiplicity , or in the multiple scattering approach , by the number of pomerons  being proportional to the multiplicity . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> this will lead to a preferred expansion along the @xmath8 axis , and a @xmath9 shape of the correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the question is only , if the fluctuations are sufficiently big and sufficiently frequent to provide a quantitative agreement with the observed correlation functions . in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the origin of the double ridge are random azimuthal asymmetries , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eibp2 ] , which lead to asymmetric flow and to a double peak structure in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the translational invariance of the structure finally leads to a double ridge . </S>",

    "<S> pions appear red , protons blue . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2b ] ]    clearly visible in data and in the simulations : a separation of the results for the three hadron species : in the @xmath3 range of 1 - 1.5 gev / c , the kaon @xmath0 is somewhat below the pion one , whereas the proton result is clearly below the two others . to discuss higher values of @xmath3 ( and due to limited statistics ) , we use a different binning in @xmath3 ( 0.5 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 4 gev / c ) , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : v2b ] . </S>",
    "<S> we compare pion and proton results , and we clearly see ( in data and simulations ) a `` crossing '' : the @xmath0 of protons is below the one of pions , below @xmath30gev / c , and above beyond @xmath30gev / c .    within our fluid dynamical approach , </S>",
    "<S> the above results are nothing but a `` mass splitting '' . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is based on an asymmetric ( mainly elliptical ) flow , which translates into the corresponding azimuthal asymmetry for particle spectra . </S>",
    "<S> since a given velocity translates into momentum as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the mass of hadron type @xmath33 , flow effects show up at higher values of @xmath3 for higher mass particles .    to summarize : we have shown that a realistic fluid dynamical scenario describes quantitatively the observed mass splitting of the elliptical flow coefficients @xmath0 for pions , kaons , and protons . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a strong argument in favor of the existence of a fluid dynamical expansion in proton - lead collisions at 5tev . </S>"
