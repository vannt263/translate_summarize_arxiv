    "this finding is commonly interpreted as evidence that the growth of smbhs and their host spheroids is connected . given the effectiveness of violent galaxy mergers to dissipate angular momentum ,",
    "mergers have long been proposed as a means to forge this connection ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; hernquist et al .  1989 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the strong gravitational torques produced as a result of a merger funnel gas to the center of a galaxy , triggering both accretion onto the central black hole and star formation that grows the stellar bulge ( barnes & hernquist 1991 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "coupled with self - regulated black hole growth ( i.e. ,  agn feedback ; di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) , galaxy mergers provide an attractive mechanism to both trigger agn activity and help explain the co - evolution observed between smbhs and their host galaxies .",
    "however , observational attempts to tie agn activity to galaxy mergers have produced mixed results .",
    "gas - rich mergers are observed to fuel a substantial fraction of bright quasars ( e.g.  guyon et al .",
    "2006 ; bennert et al .  2008 ; veilleux et al .  2009 ;",
    "koss et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) and recent studies of kinematic galaxy pairs have demonstrated that nuclear activity is indeed enhanced in galaxies with an interacting companion ( silverman et al .",
    "2011 ; ellison et al .",
    "2011 ) . on the other hand",
    ", morphological studies have consistently found that the bulk of the agn population does not appear to be triggered by major galaxy mergers .",

    "2011 ; villforth et al .",
    "2014 ) and more recently at @xmath13 ( schawinski et al .  2011 ; kocevski et al .  2012",
    "; rosario et al .  2015 ) , studies have found that x - ray selected agn hosts are no more likely to exhibit morphological disturbances compared to similar inactive galaxies .",
    "in fact , results from the candels survey ( grogin et al .  2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) indicate that roughly half of moderate - luminosity ( @xmath14 erg s@xmath15 ) agn at @xmath13 reside in disks and are likely fueled stochastically by secular processes and/or disk instabilities rather than major mergers ( kocevski et al .",
    "2012 ) .    while the efficiency of stochastic fueling is expected to increase with redshift , given the rapid rise in the gas fraction of galaxies at @xmath16 ( see e.g.  tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ) , agn fueling models predict that only a small fraction ( @xmath1730% ) of the overall agn luminosity density and bh mass density are the result of this fueling mode ( hopkins , kocevski , & bundy 2014 ) .",
    "instead the majority of smbh growth is predicted to be the result of merger - induced fueling , especially at high luminosities ( @xmath18 erg s@xmath15 ; hopkins & hernquist 2009 ; draper & balantyne 2012 ) . the low merger fraction observed among x - ray selected agn out to @xmath13 appears to be at odds with this prediction .",
    "a major caveat associated with these findings is that heavily obscured agn are not well sampled by x - ray surveys ( see e.g.  treister et al .",
    "the most obscured , compton - thick agn ( hereafter ct - agn ) are hidden by extreme column densities ( @xmath19 @xmath2 ) of obscuring gas that can absorb even hard x - ray photons .",
    "analysis of the diffuse x - ray background indicates a significant fraction ( up to @xmath20% ) of agn are hidden behind compton - thick obscuration ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 ; ueda et al .  2003 ; gilli et al .",
    "2007 ) ; akylas et al .  2012 ) , however much remains unknown about the demographics of their host galaxies . in the evolutionary sequence of sanders",
    "( 1998 ) , heavily obscured agn represent a key phase in the life cycle of galaxies , as it is during this period that smbhs are predicted to accrete the bulk of their mass ( e.g. , fabian 1999 ; gilli et al .  2007 ;",
    "treister et al .",
    "2009 ; draper & ballantyne 2010 ) .",
    "furthermore , hydrodynamical merger simulations predict that this obscured phase should coincide with the most morphologically disturbed phase of a galaxy interaction ( cattaneo et al .",
    "2005 ; hopkins et al .",
    "it is therefore acutely possible that past studies have systematically missed the agn - merger connection by not sampling the obscured agn population well .",
    "several studies have attempted to overcome this bias by selecting agn at mid - infrared ( ir ) wavelengths , where radiation absorbed by obscuring circumnuclear dust is expected to be re - emitted ( e.g.  lacy et al .",
    "2004 ; stern et al .  2005 ; daddi et al .  2007 ; donley et al .  2007 ; soifer et al .",
    "however , the most recent work to examine the morphologies of ir - selected agn have produced conflicting results .",
    "schawinski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) examined the morphologies of @xmath21m - selected dust obscured galaxies ( dogs ) at @xmath13 , a high fraction of which are thought to host heavily obscured agn based on x - ray stacking analyses ( fiore et al .",
    "2008 ; treister et al .",
    "the authors report a high disk fraction ( 90% ) and a relatively low merger fraction ( 4% ) that is consistent with studies of more unobscured agn hosts ( i .. e . ,  schawinski et al .",
    "2011 ) . on the other hand , donley et al .",

    ".  2007 , 2012 ) , have a higher fraction of disturbed morphologies compared to x - ray detected agn hosts that do not exhibit similar ir emission .",
    "this might be a result of the power - law technique preferentially selecting relatively high luminosity agn , which may be more associated with galaxy mergers ( e.g. , draper & ballantyne 2012 ; treister et al .",

    "examine the connection between agn obscuration and host morphology using a sample of heavily obscured agn identified by their x - ray spectral properties .",
    "due to the differential absorption of hard and soft x - ray photons , the shape of an agn s x - ray spectrum reveals not only the presence of gas along the line of sight , but it also provides a measure of its column density .",
    "ct - agn , in particular , can be identified by their x - ray spectra due to nuclear emission that is compton scattered into our line of sight even when the direct emission is suppressed .",
    "this `` reflected '' emission has a characteristic spectral shape consisting of a flat continuum and a high equivalent width fe k@xmath22 fluorescence line ( reynolds et al .",
    "1994 ; matt , brandt & fabian 1996 ) .    identifying ct - agn using low energy ( @xmath23 kev ) observations from _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ is challenging because the heavy attenuation suffered at these wavelengths often restricts the accuracy of any x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "in addition , ct - agn often appear softer than expected at low energies due to their reflection - dominated emission . as a result ,",
    "a simple absorbed power - law fit to the soft x - ray spectra of ct - agn will systematically underestimate their obscuring column density , as was recently shown using _",
    "observations ( gandhi et al .  2014 ; lansbury et al .",

    "these models include all of the signatures of compton - thick obscuration in a single model , allowing for the identification of ct - agn in lower signal - to - noise data than previously possible .",

    "the spectral fitting was carried out with xspec using the cash statistic ( c - stat ; cash 1979 ) .",
    "the spectral models we use are from brightman & nandra ( 2011 ) , which employ monte carlo simulations to account for compton scattering and the geometry of the obscuring material .",

    "in these models , the column density , @xmath42 , primary power - law index , @xmath43 , and power - law normalization are free parameters . rather than attempting to constrain the torus opening angle from the spectra , three different cases where tested where torus opening angles were fixed at @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; here @xmath46 is essentially a @xmath47 spherical distribution . for opening angles",

    "when the opening angle is @xmath46 , we do not include this scattered component as this model represents the case where there is no escape route for the primary radiation to be scattered into the line of sight .",
    "the fourth model is a simple power - law model with two free parameters , the power - law index , @xmath43 , and its normalization , which represents purely unobscured x - ray emission .",
    "each of the four model combinations is fit to the source spectrum in turn with at least 100 iterations .",
    "we adopted a critical @xmath50c - stat of @xmath51 as the minimum decrease in the fit statistic required for xspec to say that it has found the minimum .",
    "the best - fitting model combination is chosen to be that which presents the lowest c - stat value after penalizing the more complex models ( those with more free parameters ) .",
    "however , brightman & ueda ( 2012 ) have shown that for sources with less than 600 counts , large uncertainties in the spectral fits can be reduced by fixing the power - law index in the fit .",
    "thus , for these sources , we use a fixed value of @xmath52 , the mean spectral index of sources with more than 600 counts .",
    "we do , however , allow a consideration for intrinsically steep or flat spectra . if the best - fitting model for sources with less than 600 counts , where @xmath43 is free , is a significantly better fit than the best - fitting model where @xmath43 is fixed , using the criterion of @xmath50c - stat @xmath53 2.71 , we choose the model with @xmath43 free as the best - fitting model . in total ,",
    "the fraction of sources where @xmath43 is left free is 221/549 , 220/937 , and 232/1761 in the cdfs , egs , and cosmos fields , respectively .",
    "examples of our x - ray spectral fits in all three fields can be seen in figure [ fig - spectra ] .    from our spectral fits",
    "we obtain a best - fit line - of - sight column density , @xmath42 , for each source in our parent sample .",
    "the resulting distribution of @xmath42 versus redshift and luminosity is shown in figure [ fig - lx_z_nh ] . as reported in brightman et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we find that heavily obscured ( @xmath19 @xmath2 ) sources are best fit by the torus models with opening angles of 30 or 60 degrees , i.e. not the 0 degree model , whereas sources with @xmath54 @xmath2 @xmath55 @xmath2 are better fit by the 0 degree model .",
    "this is mostly due to the models being degenerate below @xmath56 @xmath2 , so the best fit model was chosen to be the simplest one , which was the 0 degree model .",
    "furthermore , for compton - thin sources , we find that the @xmath42 values obtained using our torus models are in very good agreement with the result obtained by lanzuisi et al .",

    ", we define a primary sample of heavily obscured agn as those sources with @xmath3 and @xmath57 @xmath2 .",
    "we have chosen a column density limit that is lower than the canonical cutoff for compton - thick agn ( @xmath58 @xmath2 ) in order to increase our sample size of heavily obscured agn .",
    "in addition , our upper redshift limit is motivated by the fact that only 21% of the heavily obscured agn at @xmath59 in our three target fields have been imaged with hst / wfc3 . without this near - infrared imaging",
    "we can not properly access the rest - frame optical morphology of galaxies beyond @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , we limit our analysis to those sources at @xmath3 that fall within the egs , goods and cosmos hst / acs imaging .    using these selection criteria results in a sample of 154 heavily obscured agn at @xmath3 in our three target fields . for simplicity , we will refer to these sources as our ct - agn sample for the remainder of the paper , despite our relaxed @xmath42 cut . of this sample , 21 ct - agn",

    "these two control samples consist of unobscured agn with @xmath6 @xmath2 and moderately obscured agn with @xmath61 @xmath2 . in order to match the redshift and luminosity distributions of the samples , for each ct - agn",
    "we randomly select two unobscured and two moderately obscured agn that have a redshift within @xmath62 and an absorption corrected x - ray luminosity within a factor of two ( @xmath63 ) of the ct - agn . for this matching",
    "we use rest - frame 2 - 10 kev absorption corrected luminosities , which are derived by setting @xmath42=0 in our best - fit spectral model .",
    "if two unique comparison agn could not be found within this parameter range , the search range is iteratively increased by 10% . because of differences in the depth of the goods - s , egs and cosmos hst / acs imaging , the control agn were selected separately for each region .",

    "selecting control agn matched in luminosity is challenging because the large absorption corrections applied to the luminosities of the ct - agn make them among the most luminous sources in our fields .",
    "statistically ( i.e.  according to a k - s test ) , the luminosity distributions of the three subsamples are not perfectly matched , with the ct - agn having a longer tail toward higher x - ray luminosities , as evidenced by their slightly higher median 2 - 10 kev luminosity .",
    "however , our methodology effectively ensures that we have selected the most luminous moderately obscured and unobscured sources in each field that have similar redshifts as the ct - agn .",
    "unfortunately , the only way to improve our luminosity matching would be to increase the sample size of agn available to draw upon .",
    "a proper redshift and luminosity matching is vital since it has been proposed that galaxy mergers play a greater role in triggering luminous agn , while secular processes trigger lower luminosity agn ( e.g. , triester et al .",
    "that said , we do not believe the difference in the median luminosity of the three subsamples is large enough to be the primary driver of the results presented in  4 as we find no systematic trend between disturbed morphologies and absorption - corrected luminosity among the ct - agn that would indicate mergers dominate the tail of the ct - agn luminosity distribution .    finally , since we are interested in assessing the morphology of the agn hosts , we follow cisternas et al .",

    "the possible morphologies were : _ disk _ , _ spheroid _ , _ irregular / peculiar _ , _ point - like_. these classes are mutually exclusive and only the predominate morphology of each galaxy was noted .",
    "for example , disk galaxies with a substantial bulge component would simply be classified as disks in this system .",

    "( 2012 ) , where bulge and disk dominated late - type galaxies were differentiated .",

    "as long as an extended disk is visible , regardless of the level of nuclear agn contamination , the galaxy is classified as a _",
    "disk_. this is physically motivated by the fact that disks are easily destroyed in major mergers and take a considerable amount of time to reform ( robertson et al .",
    "2006 ) . therefore the presence of a disk constrains , to a certain extent , the past merger history of a given galaxy .    to gauge the degree to which a galaxy is disturbed , three disturbance classifications were used :    = 0.25 in = 1 @xmath73 _ merger / interaction : _ two distinct galaxies showing interaction features such as tidal arms or a single train - wreck system exhibiting strong distortions .",

    "= 0.25 in = 1 @xmath73 _ undisturbed : _ none of the above .",
    "+    in this scheme the _ merger / interaction _ class includes train - wreck mergers that have multiple nuclei and/or strong distortions in a single coalescing system , as well as disturbed galaxies with an interacting companion .",
    "the _ disturbed / asymmetric _ class , however , serves as a more liberal selection of galaxies that may have experienced an interaction in the recent past .",
    "this class includes any galaxy which has a distorted or asymmetric light profile , even those with no visible interacting companion . as a result , these classes are not mutually exclusive .",

    "this may be expected if heavy nuclear obscuration is blocking emission from the central engine in these sources .",
    "for our control sample of unobscured agn ( @xmath6 @xmath2 ) we find a lower disk fraction ( @xmath8 ) relative to the ct - agn hosts , a slightly higher spheroid fraction ( @xmath77 ) , and a lower irregular fraction ( @xmath78 ) . unlike their heavily obscured counterparts , a much larger fraction of the unobscured sources appear point - like in the acs imaging , accounting for @xmath79 of the host morphologies .",
    "the hosts of the moderately obscured ( @xmath4 @xmath2 @xmath80 @xmath2 ) control sample have morphologies that lie between the two extremes of the compton - thick and unobscured agn . here",
    "disks make up @xmath81 of the population , spheroids @xmath82 and irregulars @xmath83 .",
    "we find an increased point - like fraction ( @xmath84 ) relative the ct - agn population , however this fraction is lower than that found in the unobscured control sample .    the fraction of agn with disturbed morphologies in each of our three subsamples is also shown on the right side of figure [ fig - summary - wps ] .",
    "we find a statistically significant increase in the _ merger / interaction _ fraction versus agn obscuration , rising from @xmath10 among the unobscured agn to @xmath85 for the moderately obscured agn and @xmath9 for the ct - agn sample .",
    "the increase in the merger fraction of the ct - agn relative to their unobscured counterparts is significant at the 3.8@xmath11 level .",
    "if we include any galaxy that has a distorted or asymmetric light profile , the overall disturbed fraction increases in all three samples , but the trend with obscuration remains .",
    "disturbed / asymmetric _ fraction increases from @xmath86 among the unobscured agn to @xmath87 for the moderately obscured agn and @xmath88 for the ct - agn sample . here the difference in the disturbed fraction of the ct - agn relative to the unobscured agn is significant at the 4.4@xmath11 level .",
    "as discussed in  3 , the high point source fraction among the unobscured agn may artificially drive the disturbed fraction down for that subsample since unresolved hosts are classified as _",
    "undisturbed _ by default . to account for this",
    ", we have excluded all unresolved hosts from our analysis and present the resulting morphology and disturbance fractions in figure [ fig - summary - nops ] . when considering only extended hosts , we find that the disk fraction of the three subsamples is in much greater agreement , although the ct - agn are still found in disk hosts more often than the unobscured agn .",
    "we find the disk fraction steadily increases from @xmath89 among the unobscured agn to @xmath90 for the moderately obscured agn and @xmath91 for the ct - agn sample .",
    "this trend reverses for the spheroid fraction , which steadily decreases with obscuration . here",
    "the spheroid fraction decreases from @xmath92 among the unobscured agn to @xmath93 for the moderately obscured agn and @xmath94 for the ct - agn sample .",
    "the irregular fraction is low for all three subsamples and consistent with showing no trend with obscuration .",
    "the fraction of agn in extended hosts that exhibit a morphological disturbance is shown in figures [ fig - dist ] and [ fig - merg ] .",
    "the correlation between merger fraction and obscuration is still evident when excluding point sources , however the statistical significance of the increase drops from 3.8@xmath11 to 2.5@xmath11 .",
    "the _ merger / interaction _ fraction is now @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , for the unobscured , moderately obscured , and ct - agn samples .",
    "a similar trend is found for the _ disturbed / asymmetric _ fraction , which increases from @xmath98 among the unobscured agn to @xmath99 for the moderately obscured agn and @xmath100 for the ct - agn sample . here",
    "the statistical significance of the increase is now 2.3@xmath11 .    in summary , we find an increasing disk fraction and a decreasing spheroid fraction with increasing nuclear obscuration among agn at @xmath101 .",
    "in addition , we find that the fraction of agn with disturbed host morphologies increases as a function of obscuration . this increase is found whether we consider only train - wreck mergers and galaxies with clear interacting companions or any galaxy showing an asymmetric light profile .",
    "it is also present regardless of whether we exclude unresolved host galaxies from our analysis , albeit at a reduced statistical significance .",
    "using a sample of heavily obscured agn identified by their x - ray spectral signatures , we find a correlation between disturbed host morphology and nuclear obscuration at fixed agn luminosity and redshift . in this section",
    "we discuss the implications of this result in terms of both the agn unification model (  5.1 ) and the role that mergers play in fueling smbh growth (  5.2 ) .",
    "in addition , we conclude the section with a discussion of several important caveats to keep in mind when interpreting our findings (  5.3 ) .",
    "the standard unification paradigm invokes a torus - like structure that obscures the central engine for some sight lines and not for others , producing the two observed agn types . in this scheme agn obscuration",
    "is largely dependent on the viewing angle of the observer ( antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ; tran 2003 ) and therefore all agn would sample the same parent population of host galaxies , regardless of their level of obscuration .",
    "in other words , there should be no correlation between heavy nuclear obscuration and disturbed host morphologies .",
    "alternatively , obscured smbh growth may be a distinct phase in the co - evolution of agn and their hosts , specifically one in which the central engine goes through rapid growth phase following a merger event ( sander et al .",
    "1998 ; hopkins et al .  2005 , 2008 ) .",
    "this is supported by the findings of draper & ballantyne 2010 , who suggest that a vast majority of agn accreting near the eddington limit must be hidden by compton - thick obscuration based on the observed space density of ct - agn and their contribution to the cxb .",
    "furthermore , hydrodynamical merger simulations predict that this obscured phase should coincide with the most morphologically disturbed phase of a galaxy interaction ( cattaneo et al .  2005 ; hopkins et al .  2008 ) .",
    "therefore , merger - driven co - evolution models predict that there should be a strong dependence between obscuration and host properties such as morphology .",
    "the fact that we observe a different disk / spheroid and merger fraction versus obscuration indicates that viewing angle can not be the only thing differentiating our three agn samples , as the unification model would suggest .",
    "that is not to say that viewing angle plays no part in obscuring the ct - agn in our sample , only that interactions play a greater role in fueling their activity relative to the unobscured agn in our control samples .",
    "this finding appears to support an evolutionary scenario , in which an increased fraction of the ct - agn are heavily obscured as a result of a growth phase triggered by a galaxy interaction in the recent past .",
    "given that the ct - agn are hosted by largely disk - dominated galaxies , we propose that we are catching these systems near the start of this evolutionary sequence , before the disk structure of these galaxies is substantially disturbed or destroyed .",
    "this may be due to increasing obscuration levels as the merger sequence progresses .",
    "for example , if the covering fraction of the obscuring torus is higher for sources further along in the merger sequence , then the fraction of x - ray photons scattered into our line - of - sight would decrease and we would therefore not be sensitive to the most disturbed sources . our proposed location for the ct - agn sample in a possible evolutionary sequence is illustrated in figure [ fig - lotz ] .",
    "previous studies have reached similar conclusions regarding the transitional nature of obscured agn .",
    "for example , the hosts of dust - reddened quasars ( urrutia et al .",
    "2009 ; glikman et al .",
    "2004 , 2012 ) show a high incidence of merger activity and a disturbance fraction that increases with increasing obscuration ( urrutia et al .",
    "2008 ; glikman et al .",
    "these quasars are intrinsically more luminous than the ct - agn in our sample and are preferentially found in spheroid - dominated hosts .",
    "it is therefore thought that these quasars are detected in the final stages of emerging from their dusty cocoons and near the end of the evolutionary sequence outlined in figure [ fig - lotz ] ( urrutia et al .",
    "2012 , glikman et al .",
    "2012 , banerji et al .",
    ".    our results also agree with the recent findings of donley et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and juneau et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , who examined the morphologies and star formation activity , respectively , of obscured agn selected by their mid - infrared colors and emission line properties . in the former , the hosts of irac power - law selected agn ( donley et al .",
    "2008 ) are found to be more disturbed than their x - ray selected , and presumably less obscured , counterparts . in the latter",
    ", the obscured agn fraction is found to be higher among galaxies with elevated specific star formation rates , which the authors argue may be due to recent galaxy interactions .    on the other hand ,",
    "our findings are at odds with the results of schawinski et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . here",
    "the authors examined the morphology of dogs in the extended cdfs , which are thought to host heavily obscured quasars based on the x - ray stacking analysis of treister et al .",
    "this study found that only a small fraction ( @xmath102 ) of dogs at @xmath103 show signs of recent merger activity .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that only one of our ct - agn in the cdfs would be selected as an obscured agn via the infrared excess method employed by schawinski et al .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of comastri et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who noted that x - ray detected ct - agn are not readily picked up by standard mid - infrared selection techniques .",
    "we therefore suspect our conflicting results are due to substantial differences in our parent samples and we caution against direct comparisons of the two studies .",
    "galaxy mergers have long been proposed as a possible triggering mechanism for agn activity , however there is a growing consensus that most moderate - luminosity , x - ray selected agn show no signs of recent merger activity based on their host morphologies ( grogin et al .",
    "2005 , cisternas et al .",
    "2011 , schawinski et al .",
    "2011 , kocevski et al .",
    "2012 , villforth et al .  2014 ) .",
    "in fact , recent results from the candels survey suggest that stochastic fueling by secular processes or disk instabilities play a greater role in fueling smbh growth at @xmath16 than previously predicted by agn fueling models ( kocevski et al .",
    "this is likely due to the increasing gas fraction of galaxies at high redshifts ( e.g.  tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ) , which acts to increase the duty cycle of distant , stochastically - fed agn ( hopkins et al .",
    "2007 , johansson et al .  2009 ) .",
    "however , even with these new observational constraints , agn fueling models continue to predict that the integrated total smbh growth in the universe should be dominated by merger - induced fueling . for example",
    ", the semi - emprical fueling model of hopkins , kocevski , & bundy ( 2014 ) , which incorporates both stochastic and merger - induced fueling modes , finds that while non - merger processes may dominate the agn population by numbers , only @xmath104 of the total agn luminosity density and smbh mass density is the result of stochastic fueling .",
    "the predicted contribution is strongly mass and luminosity - dependent , with mergers playing an increasingly important role in fueling high - mass ( @xmath105 ) smbh growth and high luminosity ( @xmath106 ) agn .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by draper & ballantyne ( 2012 ) using agn population synthesis modeling to determine the importance of different agn triggering mechanisms .",
    "it is conceivable that some of the merger - induced fueling that is predicted may have been missed by past studies of the _ chandra _ deep fields , given the few high - luminosity agn present in these fields ( e.g.  triester et al .",
    "however , our results indicate that a portion of this merger - triggered activity may also be hidden among heavily obscured agn .",
    "this implies that past studies may have missed the agn population where the agn - merger connection is expected to be the strongest . whether there is sufficient merger - fueled smbh growth occurring among heavily obscured and high luminosity agn to match what is predicted by the hopkins et al .",
    "( 2014 ) fueling model remains to be determined .",
    "a key to testing this will be identifying additional ct - agn at @xmath107 in order to determine what fraction of this obscured growth remains undetected .",
    "having discussed the possible implications of our results , it is worth keeping in mind a couple of important caveats .",
    "first , the difference in the disturbed fraction between the obscured and unobscured agn is statistically significant only when point - like hosts are included in our analysis .",
    "when we consider only hosts with extended morphologies , the elevated merger fraction among the ct - agn is significant at only the @xmath12 level .",
    "a larger sample of distant , obscured agn will need to be identified in order to confirm our findings with greater statistical confidence .",
    "this will soon be possible as a result of the x - uds chandra legacy survey ( co - pis g.  hasinger and d.  kocevski ) , which is obtaining deep ( 1.25 msec ) and wide ( @xmath108 ) x - ray observations of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) ultra - deep survey field ( uds ; lawrence et al .  2007 ;",
    "cirasuolo et al .",
    "this dataset , when combined with the existing acs and wfc3 imaging from candels , will substantially increase the number of ct - agn at @xmath0 available for study .",
    "it will also increase the number of ct - agn at @xmath13 that have rest - frame optical imaging , allowing us to extend our study to this redshift for the first time .",
    "the second caveat relates to a possible connection between the elevated disk and disturbed fractions among the ct - agn .",
    "if morphological disturbances are easier to visually detect in late - type systems , then it is possible that the increased _",
    "disturbed / asymmetric _ fraction among the ct - agn is simply a reflection of their higher _ disk _ fraction relative to the control samples .",
    "we do not believe this is the case , as the ct - agn also show an increased _ merger / interaction _ fraction , a classification that requires a visible interacting neighbor or a train - wreck morphology . in other words , highly disruptive events that should be detectable in early - type galaxies as well as their late - type counterparts .",
    "nonetheless , further work is needed to determine what fraction of interactions may be missed among spheroidal hosts .",
    "the candels team is actively pursuing this work by visually classifying simulated interactions using a classification scheme similar to the one used in this study .",
