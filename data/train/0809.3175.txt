    "the production of heavy quarks in @xmath3 collisions at hera is an important testing ground for perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) since the large @xmath1-quark and @xmath2-quark masses provide a hard scale that allows perturbative calculations . when @xmath4 , the negative squared four - momentum exchanged at the electron or positron is small , the reactions @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be considered as a photoproduction process in which a quasi - real photon , emitted by the incoming electron interacts with the proton . for heavy - quark transverse momenta comparable to the quark mass , next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd calculations in which the massive quark is generated dynamically are expected to provide reliable predictions for the photoproduction cross sections .",
    "this analysis  @xcite was performed with data taken by the zeus  @xcite detector from 1996 to 2000 , when hera collided electrons or positrons with energy @xmath7 with protons of energy @xmath8 ( 19961997 ) or @xmath9 ( 19982000 ) .",
    "the corresponding integrated luminosities are @xmath10 at centre - of - mass energy @xmath11 , and @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",
    "the measurements are compared to a leading - order plus parton - shower monte carlo ( pythia ) as well as qcd predictions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , based on the fmnr programme @xcite .",
    "this nlo programme separately generates processes containing point - like and hadron - like photon contributions , which have to be combined to obtain the total cross section .",
    "the main uncertainties of the nlo calculations originate from the uncertainties of the heavy - quark masses ( pole masses ) and the renormalisation and factorisation scales .",
    "the central values for the masses were set to @xmath14 and @xmath15 where both masses were varied by @xmath16 .",
    "the renormalisation , @xmath17 , and factorisation , @xmath18 , scales were chosen to be equal and set to @xmath19 , and varied by a factor two for the uncertainty .",
    "electron candidates were selected by requiring tracks fitted to the primary vertex and having a transverse momentum , @xmath20 , of at least @xmath21 in the pseudorapidity range @xmath22 . for the identification of electrons from semileptonic",
    "heavy - quark decays , variables for particle identification were combined with event - based information characteristic of heavy - quark production .",
    "r0.28    a central tool for this analysis was the @xmath23  measurement from the central tracking detector ( ctd ) .",
    "the pulse height of the signals on the sense wires was used as a measure of the specific ionisation .",
    "this pulse height was corrected for a number of effects  @xcite .",
    "after all corrections , the measured @xmath23  depended only on the particle velocity , @xmath24 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "it shows the specific energy loss as a function of @xmath24 , for the different samples of identified particles , @xmath25 .",
    "additional variables for the electron identification are the fraction of energy in the calorimeter which is deposited in the electromagnetic part of the calorimeter and the ratio of this energy to the track momentum measured by the ctd .",
    "these two variables use the differences in shower and cluster topologies of electrons , hadrons and muons .      to identify electrons from semileptonic decays ,",
    "the event signature of a lepton from a heavy quark and missing transverse momentum from the neutrino was used .",
    "the size of the transverse - momentum component of the electron candidate relative to the direction of the jet axis reflects the mass of the decaying hadron and gives a good separation of the semileptonic @xmath1-quark decays from other sources . to distinguish semileptonic @xmath2-quark as well as",
    "@xmath1-quark decays from the light flavour background the difference of azimuthal angles between the electron candidate and the missing transverse momentum vector was used .",
    "the discriminating input variables were combined in a likelihood hypothesis test in order to calculate the heavy quark contributions in the data set . for a given hypothesis of particle , @xmath26 , and source @xmath27 , the likelihood , @xmath28 ,",
    "is given by    r0.35     @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the probability to observe particle @xmath26 from source @xmath27 with value @xmath31 of a discriminant variable .",
    "the particle hypotheses @xmath32 and sources , @xmath27 , for electrons from semileptonic beauty , charm decays and background , @xmath33 , were considered . for the likelihood ratio test , the test function , @xmath34 was defined as @xmath35 test functions were calculated separately for the three samples .",
    "+ the fractions of the three samples in the data , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , were obtained from a three - component maximum likelihood fit to the @xmath39 distributions .",
    "the fit ( fig .",
    "[ fit ] ) range of the test function was restricted to @xmath40 .",
    "the visible @xmath3 cross sections for @xmath1-quark and @xmath2-quark production and the subsequent semileptonic decay to an electron with @xmath41 in the range @xmath22 in photoproduction events with @xmath42 and @xmath43 and at least two jets with @xmath44 , @xmath45 were determined separately for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "r0.45    the cross sections at the two different centre - of - mass energies are consistent with each other ; combining the results leads to a reduced statistical uncertainty . for the complete data set ( @xmath48 )",
    "the cross sections and the nlo predictions evaluated at @xmath47 are : +    [ cols= \" < , > , < , < \" , ]     differential cross sections as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath49 are shown in fig  [ diffcross ] .",
    "the figure also shows the nlo qcd and the scaled pythiapredictions .",
    "the scale factors have been calculated from the total visible @xmath50 and @xmath51 cross section , which are a factors of 1.75 and 1.28 higher than the corresponding pythiapredictions .",
    "both the predictions from the nlo qcd calculations as well as the scaled pythiacross sections describe the data well .",
    "beauty and charm production have been measured in dijet photoproduction using semileptonic decays into electrons .",
    "the results were compared to both nlo qcd calculations as well as predictions from a monte carlo model .",
    "the nlo qcd predictions are consistent with the data .",
    "the monte carlo models describe well the shape of the differential distributions in the data .",
    "the good agreement with the nlo qcd prediction allows the cross section as a function of @xmath52 to be extracted .",
    "the resulting cross section is shown in fig  [ beauty ] and is also compared with previous measurements by both the h1 and zeus collaborations .",
    "the measurements agree well with the previous values , giving a consistent picture of @xmath1-quark production in @xmath3 collisions in the photoproduction regime , and are well reproduced by the nlo qcd calculations .",
