    "the ` isotropic ' and ` inhomogeneous ' distribution of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( meegan et al .",
    "1992 ; briggs et al . 1996 ) is explained in a natural way if grb sources are located at cosmological distances of order gpc ( usov and chibisov 1975 ; paczyski 1986 ; goodman 1986 ; fenimore et al .",
    "however , a grb source distribution in a very large galactic halo ( characteristic size @xmath6 pc ) is also advocated ( see , e.g. , podsiadlowki et al .",
    "independent of what the distance scale of grb sources is , the mechanism that gives rise to the sudden emission of gamma rays is unknown , and it is generally believed that progress in solving this problem requires the detection of grb counterparts in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum . very promising in providing new insights to the origin and production mechanism of grbs are the recent discovery of an optical transient related to grb 970228 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ; groot et al .",
    "1997a ) , and the monitoring of its optical light curve ( galama et al . 1997a",
    "; sahu et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the optical transient may be associated with a faint galaxy ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ; groot et al .",
    "1997b ) , suggesting that it lies at a cosmological distance .",
    "the peak luminosities of grbs are highly super - eddington , even for galactic halo models .",
    "paczyski and rhoads ( 1993 ) pointed out that it is hard to avoid relativistic outflows from the grb source , and that the interaction of these flows with an interstellar medium must generate radio emission , as is observed , e.g. , in extragalactic jet sources ( see also katz 1994b ; mszros et al .",
    "1994 , mszros and rees 1997 ) .",
    "paczyski and rhoads estimated that the strongest grbs may be followed by transient ( @xmath7 mjy ) radio emission at intervals ranging between minutes ( for the galactic - halo distance scale ) to roughly weeks to months ( for the cosmological distance scale ) .",
    "we report here on observations of the refined error box of grb  970111 ( in t zand et al .",
    "1997 ) made with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in the months following the burst , and the derivation of a substantially improved interplanetary network ( ipn ) error box based on the time delay between the burst as observed with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) and _ ulysses_. in section 2 we describe the properties of the grb as observed with batse , and present the ipn - bepposax error box . in section 3",
    "we describe the radio and optical observations , the results of which are discussed in section 4 .",
    "grb  970111 triggered batse on 11 january , 1997 at 09:44:00 ut .",
    "here we describe data obtained with the large area detectors ( lads ) ; a detailed description of the instrument is given elsewhere ( fishman et al .",
    "[ batse ] shows the burst profile ( with 1.024 s time resolution ) in four energy channels ( 25 - 50 , 50 - 100 , 100 - 300 , @xmath8300 kev ) .",
    "the event duration is @xmath9 s , estimated from the summed signal of all energy channels ( t@xmath10 is the time during which 90% of the total burst counts are emitted ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "when we fit a broken power law to the event energy spectrum we find that the total 25 kev - 1.8 mev fluence during 48.4 s of emission is @xmath11 ergs @xmath12 .",
    "this fluence is among the top 1% of all grbs observed with batse so far .",
    "the event peak flux ( summed over the same energy range in 1.024 s interval ) is @xmath13 ergs @xmath12s@xmath14 , which makes grb970111 one of the top 5% brightest batse events . a slightly better fit is obtained using the band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) , for which we find that the spectral power peaks at @xmath15 = 166@xmath161 kev .    in the burst profile summed over all channels",
    "we distinguish five peaks : channel 4 shows only the first three , channel 1 shows only the last four of them .",
    "the peaks occur at times ( since trigger ) @xmath17",
    "s , @xmath18  s , @xmath19  s , @xmath20  s , and @xmath21  s. thus , this event shows strong spectral evolution , with the first peak having a very hard spectrum starting above @xmath22  kev , and the last two having much softer spectra .",
    "this is confirmed in the bepposax wide field camera observations ( wfc ; energy range 1.8 - 30 kev ) in which there are only two peaks starting @xmath7 and @xmath21  s , respectively , after the batse trigger time .",
    "spectral evolution in grbs is well known ; grb  970111 is an extreme example of late pulses disappearing entirely at high energies ( see ford et al .",
    "1995 for a detailed description of spectral - evolution trends of bursts observed with batse ) .    the burst location using the directional response of the batse detectors that recorded the burst was @xmath23 and @xmath24@xmath25 ( j2000 ) with a total error of 1.5@xmath26 ( statistical and systematic added in quadrature ) .",
    "fortunately , besides the two near - earth satellites cgro and bepposax , the event was also recorded with the _ ulysses _ spacecraft , which allowed the derivation of a very narrow and short ipn annulus ( see hurley et al .",
    "1994 for a description of ipn error boxes ) .",
    "triangulation of this event using _ ulysses _ and batse data gives an annulus of possible arrival directions .",
    "this annulus is centered at @xmath2750@xmath2855.4@xmath29 , @xmath24 + 332157(j2000 ) , and has a radius of @xmath30 ( 3@xmath3 confidence ) .",

    "we used a new uhf receiving system , whose upper frequency band covers the 7001200 mhz range , and selected 840 mhz because electromagnetic interference ( emi ) is usually absent there .",

    "the noise level in a continuum map for a 10 mhz bandwidth after 12 hours of integration is typically 0.5 mjy beam@xmath14 , and our analysis shows that this was usually achieved in the present series of measurements . at 840 mhz , the synthesized beamwidth at @xmath37 declination is @xmath38 , and the field of view ( half - power beamwidth ) is about @xmath39 .",
    "we also observed at 5 ghz on each of february 26.05 ( 5.15 hrs ) and 27.29 ( 5.55 hrs ) and march 2.22 ( 10.24 hrs ) . with 8 bands of each 10 mhz width we obtained noise levels @xmath1 0.15 mjy per observation .",

    "was usually limited to about 10 % . in the self calibration ( gains and phases )",
    "we used models for each of the 8 bands around 840 mhz , each containing nearly 80 discrete sources above 2.5 mjy . for calibration of interferometer gain and phase , for each observation and each band , we used the standard wsrt calibrator 3c 48 ( 24.05 jy at 840 mhz , 15.96 jy at 1.4 ghz and 5.55 jy at 5 ghz ; based on the 3c286 flux density on the baars et al .",

    "we searched for a transient radio counterpart by looking for variability at 840 mhz within the refined wfc-_ulysses_-batse error region . since all our observations were obtained with the same configurations of the westerbork array , the synthesized beams of the images for different days are in principle the same .",
    "the most sensitive way to look for variations in the data is via the construction of difference maps from residual maps , i.e. maps deconvolved with a model containing all real sources in the field .",
    "we obtained equal synthesized beams in the residual maps of two observations by retaining only those @xmath44 points in common to the datasets of any two days in the comparison .",

    "( 1994 ) who obtained @xmath61 upper limits of 3.5 mjy to variability at 1.4 ghz , within 3 to 99 days of grb 940301 , from observations of the comptel error box of this burst ( frail et al .",

    "our present results improve the response time of frail et al .",
    "( 1994 ) by a factor @xmath1 3 .",
    "a similar improvement has been reported by frail et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .    to interpret our null result",
    ", we take as a guideline the work of paczyski and rhoads , which is based on the idea that grbs are caused by the interaction of a relativistically expanding fireball with the interstellar medium ( with density @xmath62 g  @xmath63 ) . from their results ( see their eqs .",
    "18b and 19b ) we estimate , using a burst fluence @xmath64 erg  @xmath12 and an observing frequency of 840 mhz , that the peak radio flux @xmath65 and the time @xmath66 since the grb that this peak is reached are given by : @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; here @xmath69 is the source distance in units of 0.5 gpc .",
    "( in these estimates we have set several of the dimensionless constants occurring in these equations equal to unity ) . during the rise of the radio transient",
    "the flux increases with time @xmath70 proportional to @xmath71 ; the decay goes as @xmath72 .    the model of katz ( 1994a , b ) predicts an initial 840 mhz flux ( simultaneous with the grb , taken to emit @xmath73 ergs @xmath12 in @xmath1 30 s , over a 4 @xmath74 hz bandwidth centered at @xmath75 hz ) of @xmath76 @xmath77jy .",
    "this flux rises proportionally to @xmath78 until it reaches a peak , roughly 30 s @xmath48 ( 840 mhz/4 @xmath48 10@xmath79 hz)@xmath80 @xmath1 10 days later , around 5 mjy .",
    "thus , the models of paczyski and rhoads and of katz predict radio afterglows for grb 970111 that are quite similar .",
    "grb  970111 was extremely strong : it was among the top 1% of batse bursts with respect to fluence , and the top 5% with respect to peak flux . in the cosmological model for grbs",
    "the turnover in the cumulative burst peak flux distribution occurs at redshift @xmath81 ( e.g. , fenimore et al .",
    "1993 ) . since the luminosity distribution of observed bursts is not very broad ( see , e.g. , horack et al 1994 ; ulmer et al .",
    "1995 ) this indicates that grb  970111 originated at a rather modest redshift ( of order 0.1 ) .",
    "we will therefore , in the following , assume a nominal source distance of 0.5 gpc .    in fig .",
    "[ strom ] we have plotted our upper limits as a function of time since the burst , together with some of the best previous limits , and three curves showing the radio behaviour according to the above expressions derived from the paczyski and rhoads model .",
    "it appears that our observations exclude the model of paczyski and rhoads at its nominal parameters ( the same is the case for the katz model ) .",
    "they suggest that for the model to be viable , grb 970111 should either have come from very nearby ( @xmath82 kpc , peaking within a few minutes of the burst ) , or from a very large distance ( @xmath83 gpc , with a peak after many months , in which case its peak luminosity would have been exceptionally high ) , or it occurred with a high efficiency of gamma - ray production in regions of very low ambient density .",
    "although our non - detection of a radio counterpart for grb 970111 nominally excludes the models of paczyski and rhoads ( 1993 ) and of katz ( 1994a , b ) , we feel that in both models there are enough scaling factors that disagreement by about one order of magnitude is not yet compelling evidence that the models are qualitatively wrong .",
    "moreover , at low radio frequencies the emission may be limited by self - absorption ( e.g. katz 1994a ) .    after the revised version of this paper was near completion we learnt of the detection of an optical and radio counterpart of grb970508 ( bond 1997 ;",
    "frail et al .",
    "the inverted spectrum @xmath84 observed for this radio counterpart is evidence for the occurence of self - absorption .",
    "the measurement of a redshift ( @xmath85 @xmath8 0.835 , metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) of the optical counterpart of grb 970508 may have settled the distance scale to grb sources .",
    "it is clear that the relative response in radio is far from proportional to the strength of the grb ; the same is the case for the optical response ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "it is currently unclear what grb characteristic determines the low - energy response to grbs , and more follow - up observations are required to unravel their systematics .",
