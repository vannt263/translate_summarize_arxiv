    "the first detailed studies of the x - ray emission from nearby late - type galaxies were carried out with the _ einstein  _ observatory and revealed both individual luminous x - ray sources , as well as an extended , often complex , underlying structure ( @xcite ) . in a number of near edge - on star - forming systems .",
    "such as m82 ( @xcite ) , evidence was also found for hot outflowing winds . the superior spatial resolution and enhanced soft x - ray response of _ rosat  _ greatly extended this work , leading to the detection of substantial numbers of discrete sources as well as establishing a much clearer picture of the diffuse emission components ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently the advent of _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra _ has extended our knowledge of the discrete x - ray source populations and the ultrahot ism in nearby galaxies to unprecedented luminosity and surface brightness thresholds ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission associated with the disks of spiral galaxies is believed to arise in gas heated by shocks generated as a result of supernova explosions and stellar wind interactions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported by analysis of the x - ray spectra of individual shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) of reasonable age , which are often characterised by plasma temperatures in the range 0.2 - 0.8 kev , similar to the values obtained when studying larger - scale structures in galactic disks .",
    "@xcite showed that the luminosity of the diffuse x - ray emission observed in star - forming galaxies is proportional to the rate of mechanical energy injection into the ism from young stars .",
    "@xcite further found that the ratio of the soft x - ray luminosity to far infrared luminosity , taking the latter as a proxy for the star - formation rate ( sfr ) , is strongly dependent on the efficiency with which mechanical energy is converted into soft x - rays and also the evolutionary status of the star formation episode .",
    "this all argues for a close connection between soft x - ray emission and star formation in late - type galaxies .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + @xmath4 - diameter of the `` x - ray extraction region '' .",

    "[ table : gal_sources ]    the next step involved the creation of the spatial mask . to this end",
    ", we produced a simulated image of the point sources present in the broad - band pn+mos observation .",
    "the mos- and pn - camera psfs were modelled for each energy band as a set of sub - images representing the psf out to @xmath6 from the source position . a simulated sub - image of each source ( in three bands and two instruments )",
    "was then produced by scaling the appropriate psf image so as to match the actual image data ( in terms of the count rate contained within the nominal source cell ) .",
    "the resultant set of sub - images were then co - added with suitable spatial offsetting so as to simulate the surface brightness distribution in the broad - band pn+mos image deriving from bright point sources within the galaxy field cell centred on each source position and compared to those obtained from the actual data , with any differences attributable to the psf spreading of signal from adjacent sources . based on this analysis ,",
    "the nominal source count rates were adjusted to compensate for this source confusion effect and a new version of the simulated images was produced . ] .",
    "a spatial mask was then derived from this image by applying an appropriate surface brightness cut .",
    "figure [ fig : im_big ] shows the simulated `` bright source image '' derived using the above procedure for m83 . in this example , the bright source mask was obtained by applying a surface brightness cut to the image at a level of 0.07 pn+mos1+mos2 @xmath7 , leading to a `` spillover '' fraction , ( _ i.e. , _ the fraction of the bright source signal not contained within the masked region ) of 9% .",
    "similar surface brightness cuts were applied to the other galaxies resulting in spill - over fractions in the range 9 - 12% .",
    "the derived spatial masks were used to separate the `` bright source region '' from the `` residual emission region '' in both the spatial and spectral analysis . in order to study the spatial distribution of the residual emission ( see  [ sec : star ] ) , a simulated image representative of the soft band data was subtracted from the corresponding pn+mos image and the source mask imposed - see figure [ fig : im_big ] . this process serves to to suppress much of the `` contamination '' arising from the brightest sources in the galaxy , including the bulk of the spillover into the residual galaxy region . note",
    "that a slightly different approach is necessary in the spectral analysis ; here we take account of the bright source signal spilling into the residual emission region by including an appropriate fraction of the bright source spectral model in the spectral fit of the residual emission - see  [ sec : spec : res ] .",

    "on the basis of the approach described earlier , we extracted the integrated spectrum of both the bright source region ( bounded by the spatial mask ) and the residual emission region ( corresponding to the full x - ray extraction region less the masked area ) .",
    "the relatively large extent and complicated shapes of the bright source and residual emission regions makes the evaluation of the background subtraction somewhat more complicated than with most _ xmm - newton  _ data . in this context",
    ", the use of `` blank - sky '' _ xmm  _ fields to produce a background spectrum would be far from ideal , because the sky x - ray background in the soft band varies from field to field , and this is a vital component of the total background signal we wish to subtract .",
    "instead , we extracted spectra from both an annulus surrounding the defined galaxy region and also from the corner regions of each detector not exposed to the sky . by using an appropriate scaling of these spectra , using the method detailed in w07 , an appropriate model background spectrum can then be produced .",
    "the sas tools _ arfgen _ and _ rmfgen _ were used to produce appropriate auxiliary response file ( arf ) and response matrix file ( rmf ) files for the source and residual galaxy regions .",
    "finally , the counts recorded in adjacent ( raw ) spectral channels were summed to give a minimum of 20 counts per spectral bin in the final set of spectra .",
    "by application of the spatial mask described earlier , we are able to measure the count rates ( net of background ) in the soft , medium and hard band images associated with both the `` bright source regions '' and the `` residual emission regions '' ( hereafter we refer to the latter as the `` residual galaxy '' ) . table [ table : gal_xray ] summarises the results for each of the five new galaxies in our sample . here we have converted the measured count rates to equivalent fluxes in the band on the basis of a specific spectral model and then transposed from flux to luminosity using the distances quoted in table [ table : gal : details ] . for the bright source regions we assume a spectral model consisting of a power - law continuum with photon index @xmath8 modified by the foreground absorption in our galaxy . for the residual galaxy we use the model which best fits the actual spectrum of this component , as derived in  [",
    "sec : spec : res ] . the quoted x - ray luminosities ( ) have been corrected for foreground absorption , that is they are unabsorbed values .",
    "the  values reported in table [ table : gal_xray ] have been corrected for two further effects .",
    "the first is the spillover of bright source flux into the residual galaxy region ( discussed earlier ) .",
    "the second correction relates to the fact that the bright source mask obscures a sizeable fraction of the galaxy disk . to correct for this ,",
    "we have scaled up the residual galaxy component by a factor derived from interpolating the azimuthally - averaged brightness distribution ( as represented by the radial distributions of the x - ray surface brightness discussed in  [ sec : star ] ) into the masked regions .",
    "the spillover fraction and the area correction factor applicable to each galaxy are listed in table [ table : gal_xray ] .",
    "the results in table [ table : gal_xray ] demonstrate that whereas the set of very luminous sources represented by our bright source sample provide the dominant contribution to the total galactic x - ray luminosity above 2 kev , at lower energies , and particularly below 1 kev , the split between the bright source and residual galaxy contributions is more balanced , albeit with the exception of ngc 300 . for the latter galaxy ,",
    "we were able to set a much lower threshold for bright source removal than was possible for the other galaxies in the sample ( on account of the relatively proximity of ngc 300 - see table [ table : gal : details ] ) .",
    "in other words a higher fraction of the integrated x - ray flux from point sources was resolved in this galaxy .",
    "however , we show later ( see  [ sec : star ] ) that the low surface brightness inferred for the underlying diffuse x - ray emission in ngc 300 is mostly likely due to the low sfr density in this galaxy rather than being simply a consequence of a more stringent source rejection threshold . for m74 , ngc 3184 , m51 and m83 a broadly similar source detection threshold transposes to luminosity thresholds for source exclusion ranging from @xmath9 ( for m83 ) up to @xmath10 ( for ngc 3184 ) .",
    "the likely contribution of unresolved sources to the residual galaxy emission in each case is investigated below and a correction to a fixed luminosity threshold is applied later in the analysis ( see  [ sec : disc ] ) .    as a further exercise it is possible to estimate the likely contribution to the residual galaxy emission of an unresolved population of somewhat less luminous sources with spectral characteristics and distribution similar to the sources represented in the bright source list . here",
    "we make use of recent results from _ chandra _ , which show that the discrete source luminosity function appropriate to the disk regions of spiral galaxies typical takes the form of a power - law with a slope in the range @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( in the cumulative form ) .",
    "for example , @xcite quote a slope of @xmath11 for the disk sources in m81 , whereas @xcite measure @xmath13 for ngc 3184 and @xcite report @xmath12 for m101 .",
    "@xcite examine the log _",
    "n _  log _ s _ relation for relatively faint hmxbs in the disk of m83 and find a broken power - law provides a reasonable fit to the data , with a low - luminosity index of @xmath13 .",
    "also @xcite measure a similar range of power - law slopes for the source luminosity function within a relatively large sample of spiral galaxies .",
    "the flatness of this form means that relatively small numbers of very luminous sources provide the bulk of the integrated luminosity residing in discrete sources .",
    "furthermore , in the context of providing a rough estimate of the contribution of unresolved sources to the residual galaxy signal , it implies that we can , in principle , extrapolate below our source detection threshold to arbitrarily faint levels ( assuming of course that the slope of the luminosity function remains constant over an appropriately wide range of source luminosity ) .",
    "here we make the assumption that the slope of the source luminosity function is @xmath13 across the set of galaxies and over a wide luminosity range .",
    "we then use the number of bright sources actually observed in the galaxy from the threshold luminosity up to a fixed upper cut - off ( set here as @xmath14 - see table [ table : gal_sources ] ) , to define the normalization of the source luminosity function for that particular galaxy .",
    "we first calculate the integrated emission of unresolved sources in the broad 0.3 - 6 kev band and then , on the basis of the bright source spectral model noted earlier , split this into soft- , medium- and hard - band contributions . the entries in table [ table : gal_xray ] under the heading `` unresolved sources ''",
    "summarises the results on a galaxy by galaxy basis . in the soft band , which is the focus of our attention in describing the x - ray morphology and the linkage of x - ray emission to star formation , the potential contribution of unresolved , but relatively luminous , source populations to the measured residual galaxy emission ranges from as low as @xmath15% in m51 up to @xmath16% in ngc300 . by implication",
    "the bulk of the residual galaxy luminosity in this band must reside in some combination of : ( i ) truly diffuse x - ray emission associated with the galaxy disk presumably resulting from the energy input of supernova and stellar winds and ( ii ) the integrated emission of populations of relatively soft spectrum , lower - luminosity sources such as supernova remnants , cataclysmic variables , active binaries and stellar coronal sources , populations which are not well represented in the bright - source ( _ i.e. , _ high ) samples .",
    "there is also a potential contribution from a putative extended galactic halo , which is often seen in edge - on galaxies ; however the face - on aspect of the present galaxies suggests that a very extended halo component will be difficult to distinguish from the components confined to the disk .",
    "figures [ fig : xuv1 ] & [ fig : xuv2 ] compare the galaxy morphology observed in soft x - rays with that measured in the far ultraviolet fuv ( @xmath17  ) band by _ galex _ , although in the case of ngc 3184 we use the _ xmm - newton  _ optical monitor uvw1 ( @xmath18  ) image recorded in the same observation as the x - ray data ( see table [ table : obs ] ) to make this comparison . in all cases",
    "the the uv images were lightly smoothed with a circular gaussian mask with @xmath19 4 . in a number of the galaxies ,",
    "particularly m74 , m83 and m101 , the x - ray emission traces segments of the inner spiral arms which are delineated as very pronounced features in the fuv images . in all cases",
    "the central concentration of the soft x - ray emission and its fall - off with increasing galactocentric radius is quite well matched to the surface brightness distribution measured in the fuv channel .",
    "this general correlation of soft x - ray and fuv light immediately establishes the close connection of a significant component of the x - ray emission with recent star - formation in these late - type systems .",

    "these spectral characteristics appear to be quite typical of the diffuse components seen in normal and starburst galaxies ( _ e.g. , _ , @xcite ) and consistent with previously published measurements for several of the galaxies in the sample ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; w07 ) .",
    "the spectra of m51 and m83 also showed evidence for a `` soft excess '' which , via spectral fitting , was modelled as a soft power - law component with photon index @xmath79 .",
    "this latter component contributes 26% of the flux in the 0.3 - 2 kev band for m83 and 35% for m51 .",
    "this soft excess may well relate to the contribution of populations of soft sources most notably recent supernova remnants and , in fact , there is ample observational evidence that such sources are very often prominent in the spiral arms of late - type galaxies , for example ic342 ( @xcite ) , m33 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and m83 ( @xcite ) . after applying an appropriate area - correction factor ,",
    "the luminosities derived from the spectra data were broadly consistent with those derived from the imaging analysis ( see table [ table : gal_xray ] ) .",
    "there are two points pertinent to the above spectral analysis .",
    "the first is that the spectral modelling did not require the inclusion of any absorption over and above the foreground galactic @xmath80 which was included as a fixed component in all the models .",
    "the implication is that any absorption intrinsic to the host galaxy must be relatively low , commensurate with the fact that we are studying systems which have a near face - on aspect .",
    "the second point is that there was no strong evidence in the residual galaxy spectra for a `` hard - excess '' component attributable to an unresolved population of relatively hard discrete sources .",
    "this confirms the conclusions in  [ sec : galaxies ] , namely that relatively luminous binaries ( albeit below the applied luminosity threshold ) do not provide a substantial contribution to of the residual - galaxy emission .",
    "in fact the lack of clear evidence for hard emission in the spectra of the residual galaxy regions ( and also in the corresponding hard - band images ) suggests that the estimates in  [ sec : galaxies ] of the potential contribution of relatively luminous discrete sources might be best considered as upper - limit values .    for each of the galaxies in the sample",
    ", we have measured the relative contribution of the 0.2-kev and 0.65-kev mekal components to the x - ray flux measured in the 0.32 kev band .",
    "the results are summarised in table [ table : spec_fits ] , where we include the upper limits derived for a fixed 0.65-kev component in the case of m74 and ngc 3184 . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding flux ratio pertaining to the cool and hot mekal components in m101 ( from the spectral fitting results in w07 ) is @xmath81 .",
    "if we assume that all of the emission attributed to thermal components originates in truly diffuse plasma , then it is possible to infer some physical properties of the medium on the basis of a particular geometrical configuration . here",
    "we assume that the thermal plasma is contained within a cylindrical region extending from the centre of the galaxy out to @xmath82 of the 25 radius with a half - width perpendicular to the plane of 0.5 kpc , representing a shallow halo .",
    "using this volume , we can infer the mean electron density @xmath83 through the derived emission measure @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the ` filling factor ' - the fraction of the total volume @xmath86 which is occupied by the emitting gas ) .",
    "the derived density combined with the volume and temperature then leads to an estimate of the thermal energy contained within the gaseous component . based on the measurements from the spectral fitting , we derive the results summarised in table [ table : gas_physics ] . in the cases of m51 and m83 , where the balance between the cool and hot thermal components is most strongly weighted towards the hot component",
    ", we find that the thermal energy contained in the hotter component is significantly greater than that in the cooler component and that these two components are not in pressure balance .",
    "our spectral modelling of the residual emission in ngc3184 and m74 , although not requiring a 0.65-kev spectral component , does not exclude the presence of such a component in rough pressure balance with the cooler plasma , consistent with the situation pertaining in m101 ( w07 ) .",
    "the cooling of these plasmas is dominated by line emission with radiative timescales in the range @xmath87yr ( table [ table : gas_physics ] ) .    of course",
    ", as noted previously , a more likely scenario is that the bulk of the observed soft emission originates in the combination of diffuse emission closely associated with star - formation in the galactic disk and the integrated emission of the populations of soft sources within the disk .",
    "as noted earlier , the general similarity of soft x - ray and fuv images establishes a close linkage between the x - ray emission and recent star - formation in these late - type systems .",
    "this connection has previously been demonstrated in many individual galaxies and also in samples of objects ; for example @xcite find a very strong correlation between x - ray emission and both  and mid - infrared emission in a set of spiral galaxies observed with _ chandra_. in our early study of m101 ( w07 ) , we further investigated how the overall point - to - point correlation varies when one contrasts the soft x - ray surface brightness with that measured in different wavebands extending from the fuv through to optical v band .",
    "the fact that the best match was between the soft x - ray and u band images was interpreted in terms of two spatial components , namely a clumpy thin - disk component which serves as a tracer of the spiral arms plus a more extended component , possibly located in the lower - halo with a larger filling factor , which produces the central concentration of the soft x - ray emission ( w07 ) . however , in the present paper we focus on the relationship between the residual galaxy x - ray emission and the corresponding fuv emission in terms of their radial - averaged spatial distribution .    using the masked pn+mos soft band images ( such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : im_big ] ) , we have derived the radial profiles of the soft x - ray emission for all six galaxies in our sample .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial_plots ] ( upper panels ) .",
    "these x - ray radial profiles are based on the signal extracted from _ circular _",
    "annuli centred on the galactic nucleus , with suitable normalization to allow for the regions excluded by the spatial masking .",
    "since we wish to compare the x - ray radial distributions with published fuv and star - formation profiles obtained using _ elliptical _ annuli ( matched to the modest inclinations of these galaxies ) , we have stretched the scale of the x - ray radial axis by a factor of typically 510% , so as to account for the ( marginally ) different radial gradients obtained if one uses circular as opposed to slightly elliptical annuli .",
    "figure [ fig : radial_plots ] also shows the corresponding fuv radial brightness distributions taken from the tabulations in @xcite ( table 2 in their paper ) except in the case of ngc 3184 where , since _ galex _",
    "fuv data are not available , we use _ xmm - newton  _ optical monitor uvw1 ( @xmath18  ) measurements ( without any internal extinction correction ) .",
    "these _ galex _ fuv data have been corrected for both foreground and internal extinction as discussed in @xcite .",
    "visual comparison of the soft x - ray and fuv profiles suggest that radial fall - off seen in the soft x - ray regime is either very comparable to that seen in the fuv ( ngc 3184 and m83 ) or somewhat steeper ( ngc 300 , m74 , m51 and m101 ) .",
    "we further use the results of @xcite to compare our current soft x - ray measurements ( after applying appropriate scaling factors to convert the x - ray measurements into luminosity per unit disk area ) with the inferred radial dependence of the sfr density ( sfr per unit disk area ) .",
    "the results are also shown in fig . [",
    "fig : radial_plots ] ( middle panels ) .",
    "we find that in the inner disks of our sample of late - type galaxies , the soft x - ray luminosity generated per unit sfr ( hereafter the x - ray / sfr ratio ) ranges from @xmath88 (  yr@xmath1)@xmath1 in the case of ngc 300 up to @xmath89 (  yr@xmath1 ) for m74 and finally up to @xmath90 (  yr@xmath1)@xmath1 for m51 , m83 and m101 .",
    "note that these measurements refer to the soft - band 0.31.0 kev luminosity _ after excluding _ the contribution of the most luminous point sources .",
    "there is also the suggestion that the x - ray / sfr ratio declines with galactocentric radius , at least in the case of ngc 300 and m51 .",
    "whereas some correction has been applied to the fuv data to allow for the extinction intrinsic to the host galaxy , we have not applied a similar correction to the soft x - ray data .",
    "earlier we established that based on the spectral fitting , there was no clear evidence for any soft x - ray absorption intrinsic to the host galaxies .",
    "any intrinsic soft x - ray extinction would be most pronounced in the inner galaxy regions potentially giving rise to a central down - turn in the soft x - ray radial distributions - but again there is no compelling evidence for such an effect = @xmath91  mag  @xmath92 , which assumes a galactic dust - to - gas ratio and extinction law with @xmath93 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to estimates of the intrinsic x - ray absorption in the inner disk regions in the range @xmath94  @xmath92 , across the set of galaxies .",
    "since these values are too high to be consistent with spectral fitting we can conclude either that the assumptions underlying the fuv to x - ray extinction scaling are not valid or , as seems likely , the fuv sources are more strongly embedded in obscuring material than the soft x - ray emission . ] . as a final check we have looked for spectral trends versus radius by repeating the imaging analysis for two soft x - ray sub - bands , namely 0.30.8 kev and 0.81.2 kev .",
    "we then determine a spectral hardness ratio as ( h - s)/(h+s ) , where h refers to the 0.81.2 kev band and s to the 0.30.8 kev band .",
    "figure [ fig : radial_plots ] ( lower panels ) shows the measured variations in spectral hardness versus radius .",
    "these curves show no marked spectral variations towards the inner galaxy regions , thus confirming that intrinsic absorption does not strongly influence the soft x - ray measurements .",
    "the demarkation of the above sub - bands at 0.8 kev corresponds roughly to the position in the m51 and m83 spectra at which the cool and hot thermal components contribute equally .",
    "it follows that the spectral hardness profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial_plots ] track the ratio of these two thermal components as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "if we consider the three sources with best signal - to - noise , we find no variation in spectral hardness versus radius in m101 , a hint of spectral softening versus radius in m83 and the hint of an opposite trend in m51 .",

    "a major objective of our investigation is to intercompare the x - ray properties and other characteristics of the extended disks of the six late - type galaxies which comprise our sample . to that end",
    "we have summarised some of the results from the current analysis in table [ table : sfrdata ] . in brief",
    "this table provides the following information .",
    "we first define the extent of the disk region considered in x - rays . for this intercomparison",
    "we have chosen to exclude a central 1radius region in both m51 and m83 , so to avoid the complications associated with the agn and/or the nuclear starburst .",
    "we have next calculated the total sfr within the specified disk region by integrating under the exponential fits to the starburst density radial profiles reported by @xcite .",
    "we next report the luminosity associated with the disk by taking our soft band residual luminosity estimates and then correcting both to a common source exclusion threshold of @xmath99 ( 0.36 kev ) ( using essentially the same methodology as applied in  [ sec : morphology ] ) and to a broader 0.32 kev band - pass ( using the spectral models for the residual emission regions discussed earlier ) .",
    "these corrections were generally less than @xmath100 except for ngc300 , where the luminosity increased by a factor of 2.2 as a result of a significant additional contribution from discrete sources .",
    "finally , we also note the relative strengths of the cool ( 0.2-kev ) and hot ( 0.65-kev ) thermal components in terms of the ratio of their fluxes in the 0.32 kev ( band ) , as inferred from the spectral modelling (  [ sec : spec : res ] ) .",
    "the results summarised in table [ table : sfrdata ] establish that averaged over the defined disk regions , the x - ray / sfr ratio varies from a maximum of @xmath101 (  yr@xmath1)@xmath1 in the case of m51 and m83 down to @xmath102 (  yr@xmath1)@xmath1 in m74 .",
    "however , these disk - average values mask a trend , which is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfrplot ] , where we have plotted the x - ray / sfr ratio versus the local sfr density . above a local sfr density of @xmath103",
    "yr@xmath1  pc@xmath104 ( corresponding to the inner disks of m51 and m83 ) , the x - ray / sfr ratio is consistent with an upper bound value of @xmath105 (  yr@xmath1)@xmath1 .",
    "however , below a local sfr density of @xmath103  yr@xmath1  pc@xmath104 , there is significant scatter in the ratio , spanning a range up to a factor 5 below the maximum . on the one hand some of this scatter appears to be due to the fact that all five galaxies show evidence for a fall - off in the x - ray / sfr ratio in their outer disks . on the other hand systematic errors in both the x - ray and fuv measurements",
    "will grow in importance as one tracks a signal of rapidly decreasing surface brightness against an essentially constant background .",
    "nevertheless , these results do suggest that the efficiency of x - ray production may be sensitive to the local level of star - formation activity in the disk .    in a recent study , @xcite ( hereafter mh08 )",
    "have investigated the temporal evolution of both the soft x - ray and far infrared ( fir ) luminosity following a burst of star formation .",
    "the starting point of their analysis is the adoption of a stellar population synthesis model which follows the evolution of a cluster of massive stars formed either at the same time ( which mh08 refer to as an instanteous burst , ib ) or at a constant rate over a period of several tens of myr ( an extended burst , eb ) . in either scenario , diffuse soft x - ray emission is produced through the heating of bubbles within the interstellar medium to temperatures of @xmath106 k as a result of the mechanical energy input from the winds of massive stars created in the starburst or the eventual destruction of such stars in supernovae .",
    "their model also includes the soft x - rays emitted by individual snr during the adiabatic expansion phase of their evolution , but excludes any contribution from the stellar atmospheres ( which in any case would be extremely small ) or accreting high - mass x - ray binaries created in the region .",
    "mh08 ( see their figure 1 ) find that the soft x - ray luminosity increases rapidly during the first few myr following the onset of starburst activity , largely through the input power of the stellar winds of the most massive stars . after the first 3 myr , the most massive stars produce supernovae and thereafter it is the mechanical energy of such explosions which dominates the energy budget . in the ib models the soft x - ray luminosity peaks at @xmath107 myr , whereas in the eb models it continues to rise , albeit more gradually , until eventually an equilibrium is established between the formation and destruction of stars ( after typically @xmath108 myr for solar metallicities ) .    in comparing our present measurements with the predictions of mh08",
    "it is important to bear in mind that we have used sfr estimates based on fuv measurements ( @xcite ) , which in turn rely on the uv - to - sfr calibration suggested by @xcite .",
    "as noted by mh08 , the @xcite calibration assumes star formation over a wide 0.1100  mass range , whereas the sfr values they quote are for a more restricted 2120  range ( which has a more direct bearing on the resulting soft x - ray and fir luminosity ) . assuming a salpeter initial mass function , one obtains the scaling sfr(2 - 120)/ sfr(0.1 - 100 ) @xmath109 , implying that our estimates of the x - ray / sfr ratio should be increased by a factor 3.4 when making a comparison with the mh08 predictions .",
    "our upper - bound estimate , after applying the above scaling , becomes @xmath110 (  yr@xmath1)@xmath1 , which correponds to the x - ray / sfr ratio predicted some 10 myr after the onset of an extended burst of star - formation , assuming a @xmath111 efficiency in the conversion of mechanical energy into x - ray emission .",
    "although it can be argued that star formation in the disks of late - type spiral galaxies generally proceeds over long - periods of time , the underlying activity pattern is presumably one of localised bursts of star formation , so a match with `` young '' extended bursts is perhaps not unreasonable .",
    "of course , in matching the observations to the predictions , the efficiency of x - ray production and the duration of the eb episode are inversely linked , for example the above x - ray / sfr ratio is also reached after 30 myr in the eb scenario , provided the energy conversion efficiency is scaled down to just @xmath112 . clearly",
    "a more detailed study , taking into account additional information relating to the current star formation rate and the star formation history relevant to each galaxy disk , might well pin down these parameters - but such an analysis is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "a number of recent studies have investigated whether the integrated soft ( nominally 0.5 - 2 kev ) or hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray luminosities measured in galaxies not dominated by a central agn might serve as a proxy for the underlying galaxy - wide sfr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which might then be applicable to more distant objects ( @xcite ) . if we consider the @xcite calibration of the sfr in terms of the integrated soft x - ray luminosity ( their equation 14 ) , apply the corrections noted by mh08 and also scale the x - ray luminosity from a 0.52 kev bandpass to the 0.32 kev bandpass ( which increases the luminosity by a factor of @xmath113 depending on the spectral assumption ) , we obtain an x - ray / sfr ratio in the range @xmath114 (  yr@xmath1)@xmath1 which is factor @xmath115 higher than the ( upper - bound ) value derived from the current analysis .",
    "the difference is , of course , due to the fact that @xcite use the integrated soft x - ray luminosity of the entire galaxy , which includes a very substantial contribution from the bright discrete source population .",
    "in fact the ratio of the total galaxy luminosity to the residual galaxy luminosity over the 0.3 - 2 kev band for our current set of galaxies ( see table [ table : gal_xray ] ) is typically in the range @xmath116 , consistent with this picture .",
    "it follows that when using the @xcite calibration to convert soft x - ray measurements to sfr rate estimates , an implicit assumption is that _ both _ the rate of production of x - ray binaries following a starburst and the subsequent balance between point source and diffuse luminosity is comparable to that pertaining in local galaxies .    as discussed above",
    "there is evidence that the x - ray / sfr ratio falls as the local sfr density declines , implying that the interstellar environment influences either the starburst and/or the efficiency with which its energy is reprocessed into the x - rays .",
    "factors which may potentially be relevant include the local gas density ( relevant to the conversion of mechanical energy into heat via shocks ) and the local metallicity ( which may , for example , influence the evolution timescales of massive stars , their stellar wind properties and the emissivity of the x - ray plasma heated by the starburst ) .",
    "it is also notable that the galaxies in our current sample with the highest x - ray / sfr ratios are those with the strongest weighting towards hot plasma ( as measured by the cool : hot flux ratios in table [ table : sfrdata ] ) . in this context",
    "it would seem entirely plausible that x - ray production efficiency and `` mean '' plasma temperature are coupled quantities . although the current data are too restricted to merit further consideration of these issues , such effects may well be relevant when attempting to fine tune the calibration of the soft x - ray luminosity versus sfr relation for specific applications in which the bright source component is spatially resolvable .",
    "star formation in the disks of spiral galaxies is thought to be triggered by the passage of a spiral density wave through the ism .",
    "the resultant massive star formation results in copious fuv emission which in turn is rapidly reprocessed into  and fir emission .",
    "as discussed above , the mechanical energy input from stellar winds and supernovae eventually gives rise to x - ray emission .",
    "this would seem to give an immediate explanation of the strong correlation observed between the infrared , optical and uv star - formation tracers and the soft x - ray emission seen in spiral galaxies ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , w07 )",
    ". however , the underlying timescales are not identical .",
    "uv and  emission will be produced on a timescale commensurate with the lifetime of the most massive stars ( @xmath117 years ) , whilst according to model predictions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; mh08 ) , it takes approximately ten times longer to maximise the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "given the delay between the peak in uv / h@xmath118 emission and the x - ray heating , one might predict a spatial offset between the diffuse x - ray emission and the other spiral tracers more closely tied to the passage of the spiral density wave .",
    "for example , w07 argue that in the case of m101 one might predict a rotational lag of @xmath119 at a galactocentric radius of @xmath120 kpc ( given a rotational velocity @xmath121 and assuming that the spiral pattern corotates with the disk material at @xmath122 kpc ) .",
    "however , lags of this magnitude are not generally evident in the x - ray morphology of late - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .    assuming a gas filling factor @xmath123 1 and a spatial extent perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy of 0.5 kpc , we earlier derived radiative cooling timescales in the range @xmath124yr ( table [ table : gas_physics ] ) .",
    "these estimates are comparable to the galaxy rotational periods in the region sampled by the current x - ray measurements and are clearly inconsistent with the presence of narrow x - ray spiral arm features . matching the radiative timescales to the `` young '' extended burst scenario discussed earlier would require @xmath1251 , consistent with a clumpy thin - disk distribution for the x - ray emitting plasma most closely associated with the spiral arms . in practice , however , the observed x - ray emission will encompass a complex web of diffuse features extending over a range of spatial scales including superbubbles and , in the most active regions , outflows into the lower galactic halo ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . where there is no confinement by chimneys or similar structures in the ism , energy losses arising from adiabatic expansion of the hot gas in the disk may also help localise the spiral arm component ( w07 ) .",
    "relatively luminous discrete sources including young snrs , some perhaps linked to disk population stars in interarm regions , together with aggregations of less luminous objects , add further to the mix .",
    "we have used _ xmm - newton  _ observations in a study of the extended extranuclear disks of six nearby face - on spiral galaxies . using a novel spatially masking technique to minimise the impact of the brightest discrete sources , we have investigated both the spatial morphology and the spectral properties of the residual soft x - ray emission emanating from the disk regions .",
    "the strong correlation found between soft x - ray and fuv images in terms of the tracing of specific spiral features and the overall radial extent of the emission unambigously establishes a close link between the soft x - ray emission and recent star formation .",
    "more detailed comparison of the radial profiles of soft x - ray and fuv surface brightness distributions establishes an x - ray / sfr ratio of @xmath126 (  yr@xmath1)@xmath1 ( referred to the 0.32 kev band and where the sfr applies to stars in the mass range 2120 ) for the inner disks of m51 and m83 .",
    "this is roughly a factor 2.5 below the soft x - ray to sfr calibration report by @xcite , consistent with the fact that our estimate excludes the contribution of discrete sources with @xmath99 ( 0.36 kev ) . our measured x - ray / sfr ratio matches that predicted some 10 myr after the onset of an extended burst of star formation in the models of mho7 , when the efficiency of the conversion of mechanical energy input to x - rays is set at @xmath127 .",
    "our observations suggest a fall - off in the x - ray / sfr ratio as the local sfr density declines , implying that the interstellar environment influences either the starburst and/or the efficiency with which its energy is reprocessed into the x - rays .",
    "with the bright sources excluded , the spectra of the residual galaxy regions are , in the main , well matched by a two - temperature thermal plasma model .",
    "the characteristic temperatures of @xmath78 and @xmath128 kev are in line with published results for other spiral and starburst galaxies .",
    "the relative strengths of these two components varies across the sample , with the galaxies having the highest x - ray / sfr ratio characterised by a higher `` mean '' temperature .",
    "the physical properties of the gas found in the disk are shown to be consistent with a clumpy thin - disk distribution presumably composed of diffuse structures such as superbubbles together with individual snrs and other source aggregations .",
    "future observations should allow more detailed investigation of a wide range of factors , for example the local gas density and the local metallicity , which might influence the x - ray / sfr ratio measured in late - type galaxy disks .",
