    "nowadays there exist compelling evidences for flavor neutrino oscillations from a variety of experimental data , that includes measurements of solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos ( for recent reviews , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of flavor change implies that the three neutrinos mix and have non - zero masses , but oscillation experiments only fix the differences of squared neutrino masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which correspond to the values relevant for atmospheric ( @xmath7 ev@xmath8 ) and solar ( @xmath9 ev@xmath8 ) neutrinos , respectively .    non - zero neutrino masses imply that the cosmic neutrino background ( cnb ) , the sea of relic neutrinos that fill the universe with a number density comparable to that of photons , influences the cosmological evolution in a more complicated way than that of a pure relativistic component . in particular , the contribution of the cnb to the present energy density of the universe , measured in units of its critical value , is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the present value of the hubble parameter in units of @xmath12 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 and @xmath14 is the total neutrino mass . from the experimental values of their mass differences , at least two neutrino mass states are non - relativistic today since both @xmath15 ev and @xmath16 ev are larger than the present neutrino temperature @xmath17 k @xmath18 ev . since the current upper bound on @xmath0 from tritium decay experiments @xcite is of the order @xmath19 ev ( 95% cl ) , we know that the neutrinos account for at least 0.5(1)% and at most 50% of the total dark matter density , where the lower limit corresponds to the minimum of @xmath1 for masses ordered according to a normal ( inverted ) hierarchy , characterized by the sign of @xmath20 . thus , although in the first limit the cosmological effect of neutrino masses would be quite small , the minimal cosmological scenario is in fact a @xmath4 mixed dark matter ( @xmath4mdm ) model rather than a plain @xmath4 cold dark matter one .",
    "considerable efforts are devoted to the determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale , which , combined with oscillation data , would fix the value of the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "the future tritium decay experiment katrin @xcite is expected to reach a discovery potential for @xmath21 ev individual masses , while more stringent bounds exist from experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta decay ev .",
    "if confirmed , it would have a profound impact on cosmology . ] .",
    "these will be improved in the near future @xcite , but unfortunately they depend on the details of the neutrino mixing matrix . the quest for @xmath1 will greatly benefit from cosmological observations , which offer the advantage of being independent of the neutrino mixing parameters since all flavors were equally populated in the early universe .",
    "cosmology is sensitive to the neutrino masses through essentially two effects .",
    "first , the shape of the two - point correlation function or power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and polarization anisotropies on the one hand , and of the large scale structure ( lss ) mass density on the other , are both highly sensitive to the abundance of the various cosmological backgrounds : photons , baryons , cold dark matter , etc .",
    "the cnb is very specific in the sense that it behaves like a collisionless relativistic medium at the time of acoustic oscillations before photon decoupling ( at redshifts @xmath22 ) , but like a non - relativistic fluid during most of structure formation ( at redshifts @xmath23 , at least for one of the three neutrino mass states ) .",
    "therefore , the cnb affects at least one of the three following quantities : the redshift of equality between matter and radiation ; the redshift of equality between matter and dark energy ; or the spatial curvature of the universe .",
    "this effect can be observed in the cmb and lss power spectra and its amplitude is at most of the order of @xmath24 per cent @xcite ( @xmath25 is the current fraction of dark matter density in the form of neutrinos ) , which corresponds to only 1% in the limit @xmath26 ev .",
    "fortunately , neutrino masses produce a second effect which is typically four times larger : on small scales neutrinos do not cluster gravitationally because of their large velocities . even today",
    ", the typical neutrino velocity of a non - relativistic eigenstate with mass @xmath27 is as large as @xmath28 km s@xmath13 .",
    "this simple kinematic effect , called _ neutrino free - streaming _ , is extremely important for the growth of non - relativistic matter perturbations ( cdm and baryons ) after photon decoupling .",
    "indeed , the perturbation growth rate is controlled by the balance between gravitational clustering and the universe expansion . on small scales ,",
    "free - streaming neutrinos contribute to the total background density @xmath29 , but not to the total perturbation @xmath30 , which shifts the balance in favor of the universe expansion , leading to a smaller growth rate for cdm and baryon perturbations .",
    "this effect is of order @xmath31 per cent in the small - scale matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "there are various ways to measure the lss power spectrum .",
    "for instance , the galaxy - galaxy correlation function can be obtained from galaxy redshift surveys , and the density perturbations in hot intergalactic gas clouds at redshift @xmath32 can be inferred from the lyman-@xmath33 forest region in the spectrum of distant quasars . at present ,",
    "a total neutrino mass of @xmath34 ev is disfavored at 95% cl @xcite , depending on the used cmb , lss and other cosmological data .",
    "however , the most promising idea on the long term is to study the weak lensing effects induced by neighboring galaxy clusters .",
    "a lensing map can be reconstructed from a statistical analysis , based either on the ellipticity of remote galaxies or on the non - gaussianity of the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropy maps .",
    "weak lensing offers several advantages . unlike galaxy redshift surveys",
    ", it traces directly the total density perturbation and does not involve any light - to - mass bias . unlike lyman-@xmath33 forests data , it probes a large range of scales , which is particularly convenient for observing the step - like suppression of density perturbations induced by neutrino masses .",
    "in addition , weak lensing is sensitive to high redshifts , for which non - linear corrections appear only at very small scales .",
    "finally , it enables tomographic reconstruction : by selecting the redshift of the sources , it is possible to obtain independent measurements of the power spectrum at various redshifts , in order to follow the non - trivial evolution of the spectrum amplitude caused by neutrino masses and/or by a possible evolution of the dark energy density .",
    "the best lever arm and the highest redshifts are encoded in the lensing of cmb maps , where the source is the photon last scattering surface , located at @xmath35 , and the observed cmb patterns are sensitive to lenses as far as @xmath36 @xcite . in addition",
    ", cmb lensing observations do not require a devoted experiment : future cmb experiments designed for precision measurements of the primary cmb anisotropies offer for free an opportunity to extract lensing information .",
    "the first paper estimating the sensitivity of future cosmological experiments to small neutrino masses was based on the measurement of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xcite , an analysis that was updated in refs.@xcite and more recently in ref .",
    "the idea that weak lensing observations ( from galaxy ellipticity ) were particularly useful for measuring the neutrino mass was initially proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "then , the first analysis based on cmb lensing extraction was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that an extremely small one - sigma error on the total neutrino mass of the order of @xmath37 ev was conceivable for a full - sky experiment with a resolution of 1 arc - minute and a sensitivity per pixel of 1 @xmath38k for temperature , 1.4 @xmath38k for polarization ( these numbers were inspired from preliminary studies for the cmbpol satellite project ) .",
    "soon after , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the neutrino mass sensitivity of future tomographic reconstructions using , on the one hand , galaxy ellipticities in various redshift bins , and on the other cmb lensing , where cmb plays the role of the last redshift bin .",
    "the authors found that for sufficiently large cosmic shear surveys , it would not be impossible to reach @xmath39 ev .",
    "in this paper we want to come back to the prospects coming from cmb lensing alone , and try to improve the pioneering analysis in @xcite in several directions .",
    "first , we analyze the potential of several cmb experiments expected to produce results in the coming years , based on a realistic description of instrumental sensitivities .",
    "second , we discuss the robustness of our results by analyzing ( i ) the consequences of simplifying assumptions in the construction of the fisher matrix , ( ii ) the dependence of the final results on the accuracy of the foreground subtraction process , and ( iii ) the impact of parameter degeneracies which can appear when non - minimal cosmological scenarios are introduced . finally , we study the sensitivity of cmb experiments to the way in which the total neutrino mass is split among the three species .",
    "weak lensing induces a deflection field @xmath40 , i.e.  a mapping between the direction of a given point on the last scattering surface and the direction in which we observe it . at leading order @xcite this deflection field",
    "can be written as the gradient of a lensing potential , @xmath41 .",
    "the ( curl - free ) deflection map and the lensing potential map can both be expanded in harmonic space @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a direction in the sky .",
    "there is a simple relation between the deflection and lensing potential multipoles @xmath44 so that the power spectra @xmath45 and @xmath46 are related through @xmath47 in standard inflationary cosmology , the unlensed anisotropies obey gaussian statistics in excellent approximation @xcite , and their two - dimensional fourier modes are fully described by the power spectra @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 belong to the @xmath51 basis .",
    "weak lensing correlates the lensed multipoles @xcite according to @xmath52 where the average holds over different realizations ( or different hubble patches ) of a given cosmological model with fixed primordial spectrum and background evolution ( i.e.  fixed cosmological parameters ) . in this average ,",
    "the lensing potential is also kept fixed by convention , which makes sense because the cmb anisotropies and lss that we observe in our past light - cone are statistically independent , at least as long as we neglect the integrated sachs - wolfe effect . in the above equation , @xmath53 is the lensed power spectrum ( which is nearly equal to the unlensed one , excepted for the b - mode power spectrum which is dominated , at least on small scales , by the conversion of e - patterns into b - patterns caused by lensing ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath54 are complicated linear combinations of the unlensed power spectra @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , given in @xcite .    the quadratic estimator method of hu & okamoto @xcite is a way to extract the deflection field map from the observed temperature and polarization maps .",
    "it amounts essentially in inverting eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) .",
    "this is not the only way to proceed : hirata & seljak proposed an iterative estimator method @xcite which was shown to be optimal , but as long as cmb experiments will make noise - dominated measurements of the b - mode , i.e.  at least for the next decade , the two methods are known to be equivalent in terms of precision . even for the most precise experimental project discussed in this work",
    ", the quadratic estimator method would remain nearly optimal ( the last project listed in table [ tableexp ] corresponds roughly to the hypothetical experiment called `` c '' in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    by definition ,",
    "the quadratic estimator @xmath58 is built from a pair @xmath59 of observed temperature or polarization modes , and its multipoles are given by the quadratic form @xmath60 where the normalization factor @xmath61 is defined in such way that @xmath58 is an unbiased estimator of the deflection field @xmath62 and the weighting coefficients @xmath63 minimize the variance of @xmath64 ( which inevitably exceeds the power spectrum @xmath65 that we want to measure ) , i.e.  minimize the coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath67 of the covariance matrix @xmath68~.\\ ] ] here the extra term @xmath69 , which can be considered as noise , derives from the connected and non - connected pieces of the four - point correlation function @xmath70 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , okamoto & hu derive a prescription for the weighting coefficients @xmath63 such that the contribution of the connected piece is minimal , while that from the non - connected piece is negligible in first approximation @xcite . the weighting coefficients are rational functions of the observed power spectra @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which include contributions from primary anisotropies , lensing and experimental noise",
    "therefore , if we assume a theoretical model and some instrumental characteristics , we can readily estimate the noise @xmath69 expected for a future experiment .",
    "this method works for a given estimator @xmath64 under the condition that for at least one of the three power spectra ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) , the lensing contribution is much smaller than the primary anisotropy contribution .",
    "this is not the case for the pair @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , one can only build five estimators , for the remaining pairs @xmath75 .",
    "the question of which one is the most precise heavily depends on the experimental characteristics . in addition , it is always possible to build a minimum variance estimator , i.e.  an optimal combination of the five estimators weighted according to the five noise terms @xmath76 of the experiment under consideration . for the minimum variance estimator",
    ", the noise reads @xmath77^{-1}.\\ ] ]",
    "for a future experiment with known specifications , it is possible to assume a cosmological _ fiducial model _ that will fit best the future data , and then to construct the probability @xmath78 of the data @xmath79 given the parameters @xmath80 of the theoretical model .",
    "the error associated with each parameter @xmath81 can be derived from the fisher matrix @xmath82 computed in the vicinity of the best - fit model . indeed , after marginalization over all other free parameters ,",
    "the one - sigma error ( 68% confidence limit ) on a parameter @xmath81 would be greater or equal to @xmath83 in most cases , the forecasted errors depend only mildly on the exact values of fiducial model parameters ; however , they can vary significantly with the number of free parameters to be marginalized out , since complicated fiducial models with many physical ingredients are more affected by parameter degeneracies .",
    "it is usually assumed that for a cmb experiment covering a fraction @xmath84 of the full sky , the probability @xmath85 of the data @xmath86 is gaussian , with variance @xmath87 . if the experiment observes only one mode , for instance temperature , then @xmath87 is just a number , equal to the sum of the fiducial model primordial spectrum and of the instrumental noise power spectrum .",
    "if instead several modes are observed , for instance temperature , e and b polarization , then @xmath87 is a matrix . neglecting the lensing effect",
    ", we would get @xmath88 where the @xmath89 s represent the power spectra of primary anisotropies ( we recall that for parity reasons @xmath90 ) , and the @xmath91 s are the noise power spectra , which are diagonal because the noise contributing to one mode is statistically independent of that in another mode .",
    "it can be shown with some algebra that for any gaussian probability @xmath85 , the fisher matrix reads @xcite @xmath92~. \\label{trace}\\ ] ] in fact , due to the lensing effect , the data is not exactly gaussian .",
    "however , the difference between the unlensed and lensed power spectra for ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) is so small that eq .  ( [ trace ] ) remains approximately correct , at least when the b - mode is not included in the covariance matrix of eq .",
    "( [ covmat_nolens ] ) . beyond this issue , lensing offers the possibility to include an extra piece of information : namely , the map of the lensing potential or equivalently , of the deflection vector as obtained from e.g. the quadratic estimators method .",
    "ideally , after lensing extraction , one would obtain four gaussian independent variables : the _ delensed _ temperature and anisotropy multipoles ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) , and the lensing multipoles @xmath99 . in this paper",
    ", we will take a fiducial model with no significant amplitude of primordial gravitational waves . in this case , the delensed b - mode is just noise and can be omitted from the fisher matrix computation .",
    "therefore the data covariance matrix reads @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the lensing power spectrum , @xmath102 the noise associated to the lensing extraction method ( in our case , the minimum variance quadratic estimator ) , and @xmath103 the cross - correlation between the unlensed temperature map and lensing map .",
    "this term does not vanish because of the late integrated sachs - wolfe effect : the temperature includes some information on the same neighboring cluster distribution as the lensing .",
    "both @xmath101 and @xmath103 can be computed numerically for a given theoretical model using a public boltzmann code like camb @xcite , and then @xmath102 can be calculated using the procedure of ref.@xcite .",
    "this computation can be performed in the full sky : in this work , we will never employ the flat - sky approximation .",
    "note that the @xmath104-mode does not appear explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ lensed_covmat ] ) , but actually information from the observed b - mode is employed in the two estimators @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ trace ] ) and ( [ lensed_covmat ] ) , it is possible to compute a fisher matrix and to forecast the error on each cosmological parameter .",
    "let us discuss the robustness of this method .",
    "there are obviously two caveats which could lead to underestimating the errors .",
    "first , we assumed in eq .",
    "( [ lensed_covmat ] ) that the temperature and polarization maps could be delensed in a perfect way .",
    "instead , the delensing process would necessarily leave some residuals , in the form of extra power and correlations in the covariance matrix . however , this is not a relevant issue , because we are using only the temperature and @xmath107-polarization modes , for which the lensing corrections are very small : therefore , considering a small residual or no residual at all makes no difference in practice .",
    "we checked this explicitly in a simple way . for a given theoretical model ,",
    "boltzmann codes like camb @xcite are able to compute both the lensed and unlensed power spectra .",
    "if the delensing process is totally inefficient , we can say that unlensed temperature and polarization multipoles are recovered with an error of variance @xmath108 that we can treat as additional noise and sum up to the @xmath109 and @xmath110 terms in the matrix ( [ lensed_covmat ] ) .",
    "we checked numerically that even with such a pessimistic assumption , the final result does not change significantly , which is not a surprise since @xmath111 .",
    "we conclude that the assumption of perfect delensing performed in eqs .",
    "( [ trace ] ) and ( [ lensed_covmat ] ) is not a problem in practice by @xmath112 in ( [ lensed_covmat ] ) would actually be a mistake .",
    "indeed , in this case , the fisher matrix would include the derivatives of the lensed power spectra with respect to the cosmological parameter .",
    "so , the physical effect of each cosmological parameter on lensing distortions would be counted several times , not only in @xmath113 but also in @xmath114 , with @xmath115 .",
    "this would introduce correlations which would not be taken into account self - consistently , and the forecasted errors would be artificially small , as noticed in @xcite . ] .",
    "second , we assumed a perfect cleaning of all the astrophysical foregrounds which contribute to the raw cmb observations .",
    "it is true that cmb experiments are operating in various frequency bands , precisely in order to subtract the foregrounds which frequency dependence is usually non - planckian .",
    "however , we still have a poor knowledge of many foregrounds , and some of them could reveal very difficult to remove , introducing extra non - gaussianity and spoiling the lensing extraction process @xcite . in particular , the question of foreground subtraction is related to the maximum @xmath116 at which we should stop the sum in the fisher matrix expression , i.e.  to the smallest angular scale on which we expect to measure primary temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "if we assume a perfect cleaning , this value should be deduced from instrumental noise . beyond some multipoles ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) ,",
    "the noise terms ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) become exponentially large . thus , in practice , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) can be stopped at any @xmath116 larger than both @xmath117 and @xmath118 . however",
    ", some foregrounds are expected to be impossible to subtract on very small angular scales ( e.g. , radio sources , dusty galaxies , or polarized synchrotron radiation and dust emission ) , so for experiments with a very small instrumental noise , the covariance matrix could be dominated by foreground residuals at smaller @xmath116 values than those where the instrumental noise explodes .    since we do not have precise enough data at high galactic latitude and on relevant frequencies , it is difficult at the moment to estimate how problematic foreground contamination will be , but it is clear that one should adopt a very careful attitude when quoting forecasted errors for future experiments with an excellent angular resolution . in the next sections , for each experiment and model , we will derive two results : one optimistic forecast , assuming perfect foreground cleaning up to the scale where the instrumental noise explodes ( or in the case of the most precise experiments , up to the limit @xmath119 beyond which it is obvious that foreground contamination will dominate ) ; and one very conservative forecast , assuming no foreground cleaning at all . in that case , we take the foreground spectra @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 of the `` mid - model '' of ref .",
    "@xcite , computed with the public code provided by the authors .",
    "this model is not completely up - to - date , since it is based on the best data available at the time of publication , and does not include important updates like the level of polarized galactic dust observed by archeops on large angular scales @xcite .",
    "also , for simplicity , it assumes statistically isotropic and gaussian foregrounds , with no @xmath123 or @xmath124 correlations .",
    "however this approach is expected to provide the correct orders of magnitude , which is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "we add these new terms to the covariance matrix of eq .",
    "( [ lensed_covmat ] ) , as if they were extra noise power spectra for the @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 pairs .",
    "we consistently recompute @xmath102 , still using the equations in ref .  @xcite but with these extra noise terms included , in order to model the worse possible loss of precision induce by foregrounds in the lensing extraction process .",
    "we expect that the true error - bar for each cosmological parameter will be somewhere between our two optimistic and conservative forecasts .",
    "we consider seven cmb experiments which are representative of the experimental efforts scheduled for the next decade .",
    "the first two , based in the south pole , are complementary : biceplgg/bicep@xmath128front.html ] ( background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization ) @xcite is designed for large angular scales , while quad ( quest at dasi , the degree angular scale interferometer ) @xcite for small angular scales . the second experiment , which is already collecting data , is composed of the quest ( q and u extragalactic sub - mm telescope ) instrument mounted on the structure of the dasi experiment .",

    "note that when we take instead the cmbpol specifications of ref .",
    "@xcite , we exactly reproduce their forecast @xmath159 ev ( derived for an intermediate case with ten parameters ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that even with such a precise experiment , the results are robust against foreground contamination , since in absence of any cleaning the forecast error increases only by @xmath160 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_ellipses ] the correlation between @xmath1 and each free parameter of the eleven - dimensional model , in the cases of planck and inflation probe , with and without lensing extraction . in the parameter basis used in this work , the neutrino mass appears to be mainly degenerate with @xmath161 , and the lensing extraction process removes most of this degeneracy .",
    "in principle , the lss power spectrum is not sensitive only to the total mass @xmath1 , but also to the way in which the mass is distributed among the three neutrino states .",
    "the reason is twofold : the amount by which the gravitational collapse of matter perturbation is slowed down by neutrinos on small scales depends on the time of the non - relativistic transition for each eigenstate , i.e. on the individual masses ; and the characteristic scales at which the free - streaming effect of each neutrino family is imprinted in the power spectrum depends on the value of the wavelengths crossing the hubble radius at the time of each non - relativistic transition , i.e. again on the individual masses .",
    "the neutrino masses are differently distributed among the three states in the two possible mass schemes , or hierarchies , as shown e.g.  in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "for a total mass @xmath1 larger than @xmath162 ev all neutrino states approximately share the same mass @xmath163 , in the so - called degenerate region .",
    "instead , for smaller @xmath1 the splitting between the individual masses is more visible , and for the minimum values of @xmath1 one finds that in the normal hierarchy case ( nh ) there is only one neutrino state with significant mass , or two degenerate states in the inverted hierarchy case ( ih ) . in general , for a given @xmath1 one can calculate the difference between the matter power spectrum in the two cases , as has been computed numerically in ref.@xcite .",
    "we would like to study whether the lensing power spectrum derived from a very precise cmb experiment like inflation probe would be able to discriminate between the two models . for this purpose ,",
    "we take the eight parameter model of section [ sec : results ] and complete it with a ninth parameter : the number of massive neutrinos @xmath164 , which could be equal to 1 , 2 or 3 ( the remaining species are assumed to be exactly massless ) . in a nh scenario with @xmath165  ev , the mass of the third neutrino is not completely negligible : so , we expect the difference between our simplified scenario with @xmath166 and that with @xmath167 to be more pronounced than the difference between realistic nh and ih scenarios ( assuming the same total mass @xmath1 in all models ) .",
    "this statement is confirmed by the numerical results of ref .",
    "so , if we could show that an experiment like inflation probe will be unable to differentiate between the sketchy @xmath166 and @xmath167 models , we would conclude that _ a fortiori _ it will not discriminate between the nh and ih scenarios .",
    "we repeated the computations of section [ sec : results ] with a ninth free parameter @xmath168 with fiducial value @xmath166 .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath164 should not be confused with the total effective neutrino number @xmath145 , which was a free parameter in the last section , and remains fixed to @xmath169 in the present one .",
    "we found for inflation probe  including lensing extraction and assuming perfect foreground cleaning a one - sigma error @xmath170 .",
    "we conclude that the experiments and techniques discussed in the present paper are far from sufficient for discriminating between the nh and ih scenarios . in any case , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , future results on the total neutrino mass from very precise cosmological data should be interpreted in a slightly different way for the nh and ih cases .",
    "we have studied the ability of future cmb experiments to measure the power spectrum of large scale structure , using some quadratic estimators of the weak lensing deflection field .",
    "we inferred the sensitivity of these experiments to the non - zero neutrino masses indicated by neutrino oscillation data .",
    "our aim was to extend the pioneering paper by kaplinghat , knox & song @xcite by further investigating several directions .",
    "first , we based our analysis on the following list of forthcoming cmb experiments ( either operational , approved or still in project ) : bicep , quad , brain , clover and planck , sampan and inflation probe , taking into account their detailed characteristics .",
    "we found that even before planck , ground - based experiments should succeed in extracting the lensing map with good precision , and could then significantly improve the bounds on neutrino masses .",
    "we also found that the sampan mini - satellite project would be able to reduce the planck error @xmath171 from approximately @xmath172 ev to @xmath173 ev . finally , the hypothetical version of inflation probe that we considered would reach a spectacular sensitivity of @xmath174 ev .",
    "we also tried to discuss two questions raised by the analysis of ref.@xcite : first , is it really accurate to base the fisher matrix computation on perfectly delensed maps on the one hand , and on the reconstructed lensing map on the other ?",
    "second , is it realistic to estimate the noise variance of the lensing quadratic estimators without taking into account any residual foreground contamination ?",
    "our answer to these two questions is positive : we did not provide an exact treatment of these very technical issues , but we tried to systematically bracket the results between two over - optimistic and over - pessimistic assumptions , and concluded that the error forecast method of ref .",
    "@xcite is robust .",
    "finally , we investigated the issue of parameter degeneracies involving the neutrino mass , by comparing the results in a simpler model than that of ref .",
    "@xcite with those in a more complicated one .",
    "our extended cosmological model allows for a scalar tilt running , a dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath175 , and extra degrees of freedom parametrized by the effective number of massless neutrinos @xmath145 .",
    "these extra parameters were not chosen randomly .",
    "the tilt running was shown to be slightly degenerate with the neutrino mass in an analysis involving current cmb and lss data @xcite . the same holds for the equation of state of dark energy @xcite and for the effective number of massless neutrinos @xcite .",
    "however , our results indicate that future cmb experiments will be able to resolve these degeneracies , since we do not find significant discrepancies between the neutrino mass errors obtained for our two cosmological models .",
    "fortunately , cmb lensing extraction should be regarded as only one of the most promising tools for measuring the absolute neutrino mass with cosmology .",
    "it could be combined with future data from tomographic galaxy cosmic shear surveys , which will be very sensitive to neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation of lss information with cmb temperature anisotropies could also reveal very useful for the purpose of measuring @xmath1 @xcite . in the method employed in the present paper ,",
    "the correlation between temperature and lensing ( the @xmath176 term ) is already taken into account , but it affects the final results only marginally .",
    "more interesting should be the cross - correlation of future data from large cosmic shear surveys with that from cmb anisotropies .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results show that there are good perspectives to detect non - zero neutrino masses using future cmb lensing data , since even in the less favorable case of the smallest @xmath177 ev in the nh mass scheme the inflation probe experiment alone could make a marginal detection ( between the one and two sigma levels ) .",
    "obviously the sensitivity is enhanced for larger values of @xmath1 , in particular for the mass degenerate and quasi - degenerate regions but also for the minimum of @xmath178 ev in the ih case .",
    "the information on @xmath0 from analyses of cosmological data will be complementary ( and vice versa ) to the efforts in terrestrial projects such as tritium beta decay and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments .",
    "of course any positive result on the absolute neutrino mass scale will be a very important input for theoretical models of particle physics beyond the standard model .",
