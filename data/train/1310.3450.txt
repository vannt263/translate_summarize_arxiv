    "a knight s tour is often depicted as a broken line connecting the centers of successively visited squares , each knight move represented by a segment in the line .    in this",
    "setting , it is natural to ask whether a tour exists subject to various local restrictions of a purely geometric nature .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , g. p. jelliss has shown that a closed knight tour which does not contain a right angle ( i.e. , two successive moves at right angles ) does not exist on an @xmath0 board ; in @xcite , that one exists on a @xmath1 board and all larger boards ; and in @xcite , the present author has shown that a closed knight tour which does not contain an obtuse angle does not exist on an @xmath0 board but exists on a @xmath1 board .    following the terminology of @xcite",
    ", we say that two knight moves form a _ central cross _ , or simply _ cross _ , if their midpoints coincide .",
    "( fig .  [ f1 ] ) we say that a knight graph is a _ crosspatch _ graph if every knight move in it is part of a cross .        in order to study crosspatch tours",
    ", it proves rather helpful to examine crosspatch _",
    "pseudotours _ as well .",
    "a knight pseudotour , as defined by jelliss , is a knight graph in which every vertex is of degree two . obviously , a pseudotour is made up of a number of independent cycles .    in @xcite ,",
    "jelliss conjectures that the only connected chessboard which admits a crosspatch tour is the eight - square ring obtained by removing the central square from a @xmath2 board , and enumerates all crosspatch pseudotours on an @xmath0 board .    in the present paper",
    ", we give a complete description of the structure of crosspatch pseudotours on rectangular boards .",
    "from this description , we derive the non - existence of crosspatch tours on boards of this type .",
    "the statement of theorem [ t1 ] below was suspected by the author in 2007 , but a proof was elusive until october 2012 .",
    "given an @xmath3 rectangular chessboard @xmath4 , let @xmath5 be a crosspatch pseudotour on @xmath4 whose vertices are the centers of @xmath4 s squares and whose edges are undirected knight moves .",
    "we begin by introducing some useful notation .",
    "we label the columns of @xmath4 with the numbers from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , the rows of @xmath4 with the numbers from @xmath6 to @xmath8 , and every square in @xmath4 with the ordered pair @xmath9 of the labels of its column and row .",
    "if @xmath10 is a square in @xmath4 , then let @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 be its top , right , bottom , and left edge , respectively , and let @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 be its top - right , top - left , bottom - left , and bottom - right vertex , respectively , as in fig .",
