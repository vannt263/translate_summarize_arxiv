    "[ fig : ruler ] ) .     is applied between a and b. between c and d the voltage @xmath1 is being measured . ]",
    "the question is : when one measures the voltage difference @xmath1 between c and d , how does the voltage difference behave further down the ruler ? assuming that the thickness of the ruler can be neglected , this can be reduced to a two - dimensional problem .",
    "a. czarnecki derived the correct solution to this problem conformal mapping @xcite . in this tutorial , we present the experimental verification of these new calculations .",
    "conformal mapping is a mathematical technique which is widely used not only in physics but also in engineering . the main idea behind this technique is to simplify a certain problem by mapping it to a better suited geometry in order to simplify its solution .",
    "a complex function @xmath2 is called holomorphic , if it is complex differentiable at any point in its domain . or in other words , if the following limit exists : @xmath3 a holomorphic function @xmath4 is said to be conformal if @xmath5 .",
    "conformal functions have the properties to preserve locally angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures .",
    "the mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection .",
    "it is probably the most common way to map the spherical earth surface in two dimension .",
    "the corresponding map is : @xmath6 @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the earth radius , @xmath9 is the latitude , @xmath10 the longitude and @xmath11 an arbitrary central meridian ( commonly chosen to be the one of greenwich ) .",
    "this mapping satisfies the above condition of a conformal map and visualises well its properties .",
    "the circles of longitude and latitude are perpendicular on the map and on small scales the shapes of objects are preserved . whereas large objects can change their shape and size depending where they are located on the globe .",
    "for example according to fig .",
    "[ fig : mercator ] the size of greenland and africa would be of the same order .",
    "the solution of the problem presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : problem ] as suggested in @xcite starts with comparing the potential differences @xmath12 at two nearby pairs of points : @xmath13 it is then argued that since the ruler is semi - finite , the coefficient @xmath14 is constant and does not depend on position .",
    "this leads to the differential equation : @xmath15 if this equation would hold everywhere one would get the final solution : @xmath16 where @xmath0 is the voltage applied at the edge and @xmath1 the measured voltage difference at a given point with a distance @xmath17 from the edge .",
    "however , the ruler is only semi - infinite and not infinite , so the assumption that the voltage does not depend on the position is not fulfilled .",
    "in fact , points very close to the beginning of the ruler do not have the same neighbourhood as points further down the ruler .",
    "czarnecki @xcite derived the correct solution to this problem using conformal mapping .",
    "complex coordinates @xmath18 were introduced such that the corner b corresponds to @xmath19 and the upper corner a to @xmath20 .",
    "looking at the image of the ruler under the mapping @xmath21 , one sees that the corners a and b are mapped on the @xmath22-axis , @xmath23 and @xmath24 as shown in fig .",
    "2 .    ]",
    "if an infinite ruler would be mapped with this function , this would cover the whole upper half - plane .",
    "the actual advantage of this mapping is that every function that only depends on the distance to the corners is now symmetric to the real axis since both corners lie on that axis .",
    "this symmetry leads to the solution : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the length of the contacts and @xmath27 is a constant depending on their detailed geometry but not on their size if @xmath26 is small .",
    "the expression @xmath28 describes physical rather than idealized contacts and we thus refer to it as the reality factor .",
    "these contacts parameters are dependent on the width of the ruler .",
    "if one assumes that the distance between the left corner and the position where we measure the voltage difference is sufficiently large ( more then a third of the width of the stripe ) , this formula can be approximated to : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the voltage differences measured at distances @xmath32 and @xmath33 from the edge .",
    "to realize this experiment the following basic laboratory equipment is required :    * standard power supply ( 30 v , 3 a ) * standard voltmeter ( @xmath34 mv ) * aluminium foil ( 10 - 50 @xmath35 m , typical thickness of aluminium kitchen foil )    the experiment consists of applying and measuring the voltage difference at different points . to simulate a semi - infinite metallic ruler ,",
    "the metal stripe made of aluminium foil was cut much longer than actually needed .",
    "the wires , used to apply the voltage difference , were pulled through holes in the contact stripes as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the experimental configuration can be described by the following parameters : the length of the ruler @xmath36 , its width @xmath37 , its thickness @xmath38 and the width of the contact stripes @xmath39 ( see fig . [ setup ] ) .",
    "the voltage difference was measured in 5 mm steps form 0 to 50 mm .",
    "these measurements were performed with different settings in order to investigate the influence of the following factors : @xmath36 , @xmath38 , @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "the experimental uncertainties to be taken into account are the ones of the voltmeter ( @xmath400.01 mv ) and the one of the measuring position ( @xmath400.3 mm ) .",
    "the results for @xmath36 and @xmath38 are presented in figs .",
    "[ vvsl]-[vvst ] . as",
    "one can see , the measured points for ruler lengths of 300 and 500 mm are the same within the experimental errors , one can thus conclude that a ruler with more than 300 mm is sufficiently long for our experiment and it is a good approximation of a semi infinite ruler .",
    "the results are also unaffected when using two different thicknesses of @xmath38=0.01 and 0.05 mm .",
    "therefore aluminium kitchen foil is thin enough to approach a 2-dimensional problem as required by this experiment .     on the voltage difference . ]     on the voltage difference ]    to study the effect of the contacts geometry and thus the @xmath28 parameter of eq.[eq : andrzejsol ] , the width @xmath39 was varied .",
    "apart from the first measured point at @xmath41 mm , the obtained values are the same for all the others distances within the experimental errors ( see fig .",
    "[ vvswc ] ) .     on the voltage difference .",
    "]    the last parameter to be investigated is the influence of the width @xmath37 of the ruler . according to the original calculation ( eq . [ eq : originalsol ] )",
    "one would expect that the measured values are independent on @xmath37 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the data as shown in fig .",
    "[ wr ] confirming the inadequacy of this solution and correctness of the newer calculations     on the voltage difference and fit to the data using eq .",
    "[ eq : andrzejsol ] ]",
    "our measurements are in very good agreement with the predictions of the new calculations obtained applying conformal mapping by czarnecki and point out that the original solution in which the problem of calculating the distribution of the electric potential in a very long plate was proposed is not adequate .",
    "this problem is a very nice example of the application of conformal mapping and since this experiment is very simple and uses only basic equipment , it can reproduced in any undergraduate laboratory thus providing a very good introduction to students on this subject .",
