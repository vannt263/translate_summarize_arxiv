    "despite recent progress on the spreading of accreted matter from a disk over an _",
    "unmagnetized _ neutron star @xcite , there has been scarcely any effort directed at understanding how the magnetically funneled accretion stream of an accretion - powered x - ray pulsar spreads over the neutron star s surface .",
    "the presence of a strong magnetic field raises the possibility that the accreted matter is confined to the polar regions of the neutron star .",
    "this funneling and confinement of the accreted matter has been proposed @xcite as the reason for the apparent stability of thermonuclear burning on strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "the presence of strong magnetic fields , with @xmath4 , is deduced from cyclotron features in their spectrum ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from regular torque reversals @xcite that suggest the magnetospheric and co - rotation radii are similar . in neutron stars with weak magnetic fields ( as inferred by the absence of pulsations or cyclotron features in the persistent emission ) , unstable burning is observed as type  i x - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the funneling and confinement of the accreted matter by the magnetic field is believed to increase the local accretion rate to near- or super - eddington magnitudes , for which the burning is stable to temperature perturbations ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "confinement of the accreted matter requires its overpressure be balanced by the magnetic field .",
    "magnetostatic equilibria of this type were discussed by @xcite and @xcite . in these papers , however , the stability of such equilibria was not addressed .",
    "this question is considered here .",
    "if the magnetic field has an approximately potential dipole shape ( as can be expected as long as the accreted plasma overpressure is low compared to the magnetic pressure ) , the force of gravity has a nonvanishing component perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "such a configuration might be expected to be susceptible to kruskal - schwarzschild ( `` magnetic rayleigh - taylor '' ) interchange instabilities @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that for characteristic parameters of polar cap plasmas the stabilizing effect of the magnetic curvature is small compared to the gravitational drive .",
    "nevertheless , the line - tying in the neutron star crust eliminates interchange modes . instead , ballooning modes can be unstable if the ratio of plasma overpressure to magnetic pressure @xmath5 is sufficiently large .",
    "this instability has been a subject of numerous investigations in the context of laboratory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we find that this instability occurs when @xmath5 exceeds @xmath6 where @xmath2 is the polar cap radius and @xmath3 is the density scale height near the neutron star crust .",
    "for such a large overpressure the equilibrium magnetic field is strongly distorted away from the potential field .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin by reviewing (   [ polar - caps ] ) the conditions at the polar cap of an accreting neutron star .",
    "we then formulate , in section  [ model ] , the mathematical model which serves as the framework of our linear stability analysis . in section  [ energy ]",
    "we discuss the energy principle and derive a simple intuitive expression for the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) potential energy , relevant for plasmas in the neutron star polar caps .",
    "we then use this expression to derive a criterion for stability of short - wavelength ( in the direction transverse to the magnetic field ) ballooning modes and discuss the stability of a plasma confined by an approximately potential , dipole magnetic field (   [ ballooning ] ) .",
    "we then derive an approximate analytic expression for an equilibrium in which a large overpressure distorts the field away from the potential field (   [ equilibrium ] ) . using this equilibrium",
    "we find the marginal stability criterion (   [ evaluation ] ) , from which we compute the amount of mass that must be accreted in order to drive the instability (   [ mass ] ) .",
    "we conclude with the discussion of our results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we are concerned with the stability of accreted matter on the polar cap of a strongly magnetized neutron star . figure  [ fig : schematic ] provides a schematic of the situation .",
    "the collimated infalling matter approaches the neutron star at roughly free - fall velocity @xmath7 . at the near- or super - eddington local accretion rates , some form of radiative shock is likely to form @xcite .",
    "the region we are interested in is far below where the infalling material decelerates and becomes incorporated into the neutron star atmosphere .",
    "the continual deposition of matter into the upper atmosphere pushes the underlying material deeper , and the downward flow velocity is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the local accretion rate per unit area .",
    "the atmosphere is , to a high accuracy , in hydrostatic equilibrium . on time scales",
    "for matter to flow through the thickness of the atmosphere , the field lines co - move with the fluid @xcite . under these conditions",
    "we are justified in describing the structure of the accretion region with a magnetostatic approximation .",
    "the polar cap is characterized by two length scales : its radius and the density scale height .",
    "various estimates of the polar cap radius @xmath2 @xcite suggest that @xmath10 , and we shall adopt this value throughout the remainder of this paper . the density scale height @xmath3 is much smaller than this value of @xmath2 ( see below ) . with these approximations , the mass and radius of the neutron star",

    "we assume that the burning of accreted hydrogen and helium is stable ( this assumption can be checked _ a posteriori _ by finding the depth at which matter spreads ) .",

    "consequently , the most unstable displacement is expected to vanish for @xmath230 which implies the instability is localized to the region where    @xmath231    since the line - tying in the crust requires that @xmath232 , we therefore choose as a test function @xmath233    for this test function and @xmath234 , as appropriate for a plasma in the vicinity of the crust , we find that @xmath235 for @xmath236 for which it follows that    @xmath237    is a sufficient condition for instability .",
    "for @xmath238 , equation ( [ localization ] ) implies that the instability is localized to within 0.93 scale height from the crust .",
    "the instability criterion ( [ betacrit ] ) is obtained for the equilibrium given by equation ( [ approxflux ] ) , derived in the approximation of @xmath239 .",
    "thus self - consistency implies that the validity of ( [ betacrit ] ) is limited to @xmath240 .",
    "this condition is satisfied , albeit marginally , for the parameters discussed in  [ polar - caps ] .",
    "the instability threshold for more general equilibria , with higher values of @xmath241 , is at present unknown .",
    "assuming that the crust is perfectly rigid , the amount of mass needed to drive the instability is , from inequality  ( [ betacrit ] ) , @xmath242 substituting eq .",
    "( [ scaleheight ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) , we have @xmath243 at a given accretion rate @xmath244 , the time necessary to accumulate this mass is @xmath245 . at present",
    "we can not say what , if any , are the observable effects of the instability , but the timescale to accumulate a critical mass @xmath246 is well - suited for monitoring .",
    "using the mhd energy principle , we have shown that the accreted material on the polar cap of a strongly magnetized neutron star is subject to the ballooning instability when the overpressure in the vicinity of the crust exceeds the magnetic pressure by the factor @xmath247 , where @xmath2 is the horizontal pressure gradient length scale ( identified with the polar cap radius ) and @xmath3 is the density scale height . for typical polar cap parameters ,",
    "the critical overpressure is @xmath248 of the total plasma pressure .",
    "the instability is localized to within a density scale height of the field line footpoint ( at the top of the crust ) which implies that plasma is perturbed at densities @xmath249 ; for @xmath250 found from equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) for a model atmosphere ( cf . brown & bildsten 1999 ) , with a temperature of @xmath251 , assuming a locally eddington accretion rate .",
    "this implies @xmath252 .",
    "this density is higher than where the accreted hydrogen and helium ignite which suggests that the ballooning instability near the threshold for onset will not affect the nuclear burning .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether the instability can degrade the confinement enough to prevent a further accumulation of mass well above the instability threshold .    in our stability analysis",
    "we have omitted the contribution of the schwarzschild term to the mhd potential energy arguing that it is small in highly degenerate plasmas of uniform composition immersed in strong magnetic fields . to test the validity of this approximation",
    "we have performed a calculation along the same lines as in  [ energy ] and  [ ballooning ] , including the buoyancy contribution , for @xmath253 , for a realistic atmosphere ( cf . brown & bildsten 1999 ) .",
    "we found that this inclusion increases the numerical factor on the rhs of inequality ( [ betacrit ] ) by 17% for @xmath254 g and by less than 1% for @xmath255 .",
    "thus the effect of buoyancy is indeed weak for magnetic fields of interest , as long as @xmath86 is as small as assumed .",
    "the latter assumption , as well as that of composition uniformity , is violated in the electron - capture layers .",
    "the location of these layers is not precisely known .",
    "@xcite found that electron capture layers closest to the top of the crust occur at densities @xmath256 g @xmath257 and @xmath258 g @xmath257 .",
    "since the instability found in the present paper is localized within a density scale height from the crust which for the model atmosphere implies localization between densities @xmath256 and @xmath259 g @xmath257 , we expect that the electron capture effects would not significantly modify our conclusions .    in our analysis",
    "the crust was modelled as a rigid boundary in which the magnetic field is anchored . for this approximation to be justified",
    "the lateral distortion of the crust in response to the overpressure must be much smaller than the magnetic field line distortion in the overlying fluid .",
    "this is true when @xmath260 exceeds @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the displacement of flux surfaces in the ocean ( cf . ",
    "[ equilibrium ] ) , i.e. , when @xmath263 ; here @xmath264 is the crust shear modulus . estimates @xcite find @xmath265 , which for the characteristic density scale height and polar cap radius ( cf . ",
    "[ intro ] ) implies that @xmath266 . for the model atmosphere , this condition is satisfied for @xmath267 g.    the imperfect rigidity of the crust may affect the estimate of the accreted mass necessary to destabilize the ballooning mode ( eq .  [ [ eq : mass ] ] ) .",
    "@xcite found that the crust tended to sink in response to a lateral density discontinuity .",
    "while their findings are not directly applicable to our case , it is nevertheless conceivable that the crust could deform sufficiently to significantly reduce the applied overpressure .",
    "the mass required to drive the instability would then be higher than our estimate .",
    "the effect of the instability is an enhanced cross - field transport of matter and a resulting decrease in the plasma confinement time in the polar cap . to find the magnitude of this anomalous transport requires analysis of nonlinear effects which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the analysis of these effects and , in particular , the question of the existence of a steady state , in which the transport is sufficiently rapid to balance the influx of the accreted matter , are relegated to future publications .",
    "the authors thank ellen zweibel for pointing out the potential importance of the stabilizing effect of the schwarzschild term in equation ( [ energy-1 ] ) .",
