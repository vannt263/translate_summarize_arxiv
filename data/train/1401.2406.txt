    "it is widely held that experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have produced a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "analyses of rhic experiments @xcite , which couple viscous fluid dynamics for the qgp with a microscopic transport model for hadronic freeze - out , have related the measured elliptic flow , @xmath6 , to the ratio @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are , respectively , the medium s shear viscosity and entropy density . such studies yield @xmath10 on the domain @xmath11 , where @xmath0 is the temperature required for qgp creation .    to place this result in context we note that an ideal fluid has @xmath12 , and hence no resistance to the appearance and growth of transverse velocity gradients .",
    "a perfect fluid with near - zero viscosity is the best achievable approximation to that ideal .",
    "arguments within string theory have been used to suggest that in gauge theories with a gravity dual one has a lower bound on viscosity ; viz .",
    "@xcite , @xmath13 .",
    "the rhic result above has therefore led many to conclude that the qgp is an almost perfect fluid on @xmath11 ; i.e. , it as close as physically achievable to the case of zero viscosity .",
    "considering newton s law for viscous fluid flow ; viz . ,",
    "@xmath14 , it is apparent that in near - perfect fluids a macroscopic velocity gradient is achieved from a microscopically small pressure .",
    "strong interactions between particles constituting the fluid are necessary to achieve this outcome .",
    "hence the medium produced at rhic is commonly described as a strongly - coupled quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) , in which case its properties should differ substantially from those anticipated via perturbation theory .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is known to produce the bulk of the mass of normal matter @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 theory is characterised by confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) , phenomena that are represented by a range of order parameters , some or all of which vanish in the sqgp . understanding the sqgp therefore requires elucidation of the behaviour and properties of quarks and gluons within this state .",
    "perturbative techniques have been developed for use far above @xmath0 ; viz .",
    ", the hard thermal loop ( htl ) expansion @xcite , which has enabled the computation of gluon and quark thermal masses @xmath16 and damping rates @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the strong running coupling .",
    "it also suggests the existence of a collective plasmino or `` abnormal '' branch to the dressed - quark dispersion relation , which is characterised by antiparticle - like evolution at small momenta @xcite .    owing to asymptotic freedom , the running coupling in qcd increases as @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , a simple interpretation of the htl results suggests the plasmino should disappear before @xmath0 is reached from above because @xmath20 increases more rapidly than @xmath21 and @xmath22 invalidates a quasiparticle picture .",
    "on the other hand , nonperturbative studies using lattice - regularised quenched - qcd @xcite or dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite suggest that the plasmino branch persists in the vicinity of @xmath0 .    resolving the active degrees of freedom in the neighbourhood of @xmath0",
    "is important because the spectral properties of the dressed - quark propagator are intimately linked with light - quark confinement and it is long - range modes which might produce strong correlations .",
    "further in this connection , there is an accumulating body of evidence that , in addition to the normal and plasmino modes , an essentially nonperturbative fermionic zero mode exists on a material domain of @xmath1 @xcite and , moreover , that the domain upon which it exists defines the extent of the sqgp .",
    "hitherto , however , those studies which expose the zero mode have worked in the simplest symmetry - preserving approximation of the dses ; i.e. , they have effectively used the rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation .",
    "that truncation may be characterised as incorporating dressing only for the @xmath23 component of the gluon - quark vertex @xcite .",
    "it is accurate for ground - state vector- and isospin - nonzero - pseudoscalar - mesons @xcite , and nucleon and @xmath24 properties @xcite because corrections in these channels largely cancel , owing to parameter - free preservation of the ward - green - takahashi identities @xcite .",
    "however , they do not cancel in other channels @xcite . hence studies based on the rl truncation , or low - order improvements thereof ,",
    "have usually provided poor results for scalar- and axial - vector - mesons , produced masses for exotic states that are too low in comparison with other estimates @xcite , and exhibit gross sensitivity to model parameters for excited states @xcite and tensor - mesons @xcite . in these circumstances",
    "one must conclude that physics important to these states is omitted .    given these observations ,",
    "it is evidently worth analysing both the impact of more sophisticated gluon - quark vertices on the @xmath25 phase transitions , and whether they affect the existence and appearance of the normal , plasmino and zero modes .",
    "likewise , one should determine the impact of different assumptions about the long - range part of the quark - quark interaction . to that end , herein we employ three different vertex _",
    "anstze _  the rainbow , ball - chiu ( bc ) @xcite and anomalous magnetic moment - improved ( db ) structures ; and two different interactions ",
    "maris - tandy ( mt ) @xcite and qin - chang ( qc ) @xcite . with each of the six permutations that these inputs allow , we solve the gap equation ,",
    "locate the transition temperature @xmath0 , and use the maximum entropy method ( mem ) to extract the dressed - quark spectral function at @xmath1 .",
    "the latter contains the information needed in order to expose the properties of fermionic modes in the sqgp .",

    "at nonzero temperature , the gap equation is @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dressed - quark propagator , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the fermion matsubara frequency ; @xmath30 is the dressed - gluon propagator ; @xmath31 is the dressed - quark - gluon vertex ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 are , respectively , vertex and wave function renormalisation constants ; and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we use the same renormalisation scheme and scale as refs.@xcite .",

    ", the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration typically coincides with that for deconfinement .",
    "the gap equation is defined once the elements in its kernel are specified .",

    "those analyses indicate that the gluon propagator is a bounded , regular function of spacelike momenta , which achieves its maximum value on this domain at @xmath58 ; and the dressed - quark - gluon vertex does not possess any structure which can qualitatively alter this behaviour @xcite .",

    "it is worth reiterating that at @xmath15 each of the six kernels constructed from the elements expressed in secs.[vertices ] , [ secinteractions ] reproduce the results of perturbative qcd for @xmath75gev@xmath76 , so any model - dependence is restricted to the infrared .",
    "the single model parameter , @xmath73 , is fixed by requiring that a particular kernel provides the best possible description of a diverse array of ground - state meson observables @xcite .",
    "as made apparent in refs.@xcite , there is typically a material domain of @xmath73 within which the predicted value for observables is unchanged so long as @xmath77constant .",
    "herein we primarily use the following values , in gev : @xmath78 which are those determined elsewhere @xcite , modified slightly , if necessary , so as to ensure a uniform result for the chiral - limit value of the in - pion condensate @xcite : @xmath79 .",
    "it is notable that the extension of these interaction kernels to @xmath80 preserves the agreement with perturbative qcd at large spacelike momenta .",
    "however , an insufficiency of the interactions is that @xmath81 , the parameter expressing their infrared strength for fixed @xmath73 , is assumed to be @xmath82-independent .",
    "since the nonperturbative part of the interaction should be screened for @xmath83 , we remedy that by writing @xmath84 with @xmath85}\\ , , &   t \\ge t_{\\text{p } } \\end{array } \\right.\\ , , \\label{dtfunction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is a `` persistence '' temperature ; i.e. , a scale below which nonperturbative effects associated with confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking are not materially influenced by thermal screening .",
    "logarithmic screening is typical of qcd and we take @xmath87 herein .",
    "the parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 are fixed by applying the constraint @xmath90 for @xmath91 ; viz . , requiring a thermal quark mass consistent with lattice - qcd @xcite , a procedure which yields : @xmath92",
    "the solution of eq . can be used to compute the retarded real - time propagator @xmath93 from which one may obtain the spectral density @xmath94 equations  ( [ eq : qreal ] ) and ( [ eq : spec ] ) are equivalent to the statement : @xmath95 n.b .  if one requires a nonnegative spectral density , then eq.([eq : mat_spec ] )",
    "is only valid on the deconfined domain .    in the absence of dcsb , the spectral density associated with the propagator in eq.([eq : qdirac ] ) can be expressed @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , are operators which project onto spinors with a positive or negative value for the ratio @xmath99helicity / chirality : @xmath100 for a free positive - energy fermion . by analogy with eq .",
    ", one may write @xmath101    the spectral density is interesting and expressive because it reveals the manner by which interactions distribute the single - particle spectral strength over momentum modes ; and the behaviour at @xmath25 shows how that is altered by a heat bath . as with many useful quantities , however , it is nontrivial to evaluate @xmath102 . nonetheless , if one has at hand a precise numerical determination of the dressed - quark propagator in eq.([eq : qdirac ] ) , then it is possible to obtain the spectral density via the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite , as we shall shortly explain .",
    "the dressed - quark propagator is a matrix - valued complex function .",
    "further analysis can therefore be simplified by employing a fourier transform of eq.([eq : mat_spec ] ) . using the identity @xmath103 combined with eqs.([eq : decomposition - rho ] ) and",

    "this is plausible because a branch point is a lower - order nonanalyticity than a pole ; namely , in numerical studies , poles are features with large height , very narrow width and significant spectral strength , whilst branch points are low , broad features with lesser spectral strength . thus , compared with poles",

    "namely , the relative width of the survival domain increases as the absolute value of the critical temperature diminishes ; and , as observed elsewhere @xcite , @xmath0 decreases as the confinement length - scale @xmath181 decreases .",
    "the panels in fig.[fig : tcts ] show that the variation domains for each interaction overlap considerably and hence it is sensible to list their averages as conservative measures of the critical temperature and zero mode survival domain : @xmath182 these values are consistent with those in eqs . , .",
    "the latter describe estimates based on parameter values at the midpoint of the domain within which zero temperature observables show almost no sensitivity to parameter variation ( see the introduction to sec.[secqualitative ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath165 does not include a response to variations of @xmath86 in eq .. should good reason be offered for @xmath183 , then , as remarked already , this will modestly increase the central value of @xmath184 . )",
    "additional context for our results is provided by observing that the appearance of a third and long - wavelength mode in the dressed - fermion spectral density on a material temperature domain above @xmath0 has also been seen in straightforward one - loop computations of the fermion self - energy , irrespective of the nature of the boson which dresses the fermion @xcite . where a comparison is possible",
    ", the dependence of our spectral density on @xmath185 is similar to that seen in one - loop analyses of model gap equations . in analogy with a similar effect in high - temperature superconductivity @xcite , that behaviour has been attributed to landau damping , an interference phenomenon known from plasma physics . indeed , landau damping is typical of in - medium self - energy corrections when the thermal energy of the fermion , @xmath186 , is commensurate with the mass - scale which characterises the dispersion law of the dressing boson ; viz .",
    ", @xmath187 in qcd ( see , e.g. , sec.2.3 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "notably , our analysis shows that a coupling to meson - like correlations in the gap equation is not a precondition for appearance of the zero mode because such correlations are absent in mean - field truncations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", our gap equation s kernel is characterised by an interaction that features an infrared mass - scale @xmath188 and supports dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in - vacuum .",
    "we anticipate that the zero mode will markedly affect colour - singlet vacuum polarisations on @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this could be explicated using the methods of refs.@xcite .    our results , in conjunction with these remarks describing their compatibility with outcomes of other studies whose foundations are distinct , suggest strongly that the existence of a three - peak spectral density , with a zero mode , on a domain that extends to approximately @xmath189 , is a feature of any realistic kernel for qcd s gap equation .",
    "in order to expose the active fermionic quasiparticle degrees - of - freedom in the neighbourhood of the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration in massless two - flavour qcd , @xmath0 , we analysed the phase transition obtained with three distinct gluon - quark vertices and two different assumptions about the long - range part of the quark - quark interaction . with each of the six permutations that these inputs allow",
    ", we solved the gap equation , located the transition temperature @xmath0 , and used the maximum entropy method ( mem ) to extract the dressed - quark spectral function at @xmath1 .",
    "each of the kernels is characterised by a single parameter , which may be interpreted as defining a length - scale for confinement , @xmath190 ; and numerous in - vacuum observables are independent of this parameter for variations of @xmath191% about its optimal value . based on these observations",
    ", we obtained a best estimate for the critical temperature ; viz .",
    ", @xmath2mev , described in connection with eq .. in this study , as with those dse analyses preceding it , deconfinement at nonzero temperature is coincident with chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "if we allow for variations in @xmath190 within the domain of in - vacuum stability , then we obtain the more conservative estimate : @xmath192mev , discussed in connection with eq ..    we demonstrated that the mem is a reliable tool for reconstructing the quark spectral density and therewith obtained a result for that density which is consistent with those produced using a hard thermal loop expansion at temperatures markedly above @xmath0 , exhibiting both a normal and plasmino mode ( see sec.[farabovetc ] ) .    on the other hand , with each of the six kernels we considered , the spectral function contains a significant additional feature on a domain @xmath3 $ ] , with @xmath4 .",
    "therein , as discussed in sec.[secneartc ] , the spectral function displays a third peak , associated with a zero mode ; i.e. , a long - wavelength quasiparticle mode described by a dispersion law @xmath193 , with @xmath194 .",
    "this mode is essentially nonperturbative in origin and dominates the spectral function at @xmath5 .",
    "our best estimate for the upper bound of its survival domain is @xmath195 , as described in connection with eq .. a more conservative estimate , accommodating variations in @xmath190 , is @xmath196 , explained in connection with eq ..    notwithstanding the fact that all interaction kernels we considered lie within the mean - field class , we presented arguments and examples that suggest it should survive the inclusion of resonant contributions to the gap equation kernel .",
    "we therefore judge that the existence of this mode is a signal for the formation of a strongly - coupled qgp and , moreover , that this strongly - interacting state of matter is probably a distinctive feature of the qcd phase transition .",

    "<S> in connection with massless two - flavour qcd , we analyse the chiral symmetry restoring phase transition using three distinct gluon - quark vertices and two different assumptions about the long - range part of the quark - quark interaction . in each case , we solve the gap equation , locate the transition temperature @xmath0 , and use the maximum entropy method to extract the dressed - quark spectral function at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our best estimate for the chiral transition temperature is @xmath2mev ; and the deconfinement transition is coincident . for temperatures markedly above @xmath0 , we find a spectral density that is consistent with those produced using a hard thermal loop expansion , exhibiting both a normal and plasmino mode . on a domain </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 $ ] , with @xmath4 , however , with each of the six kernels we considered , the spectral function contains a significant additional feature . </S>",
    "<S> namely , it displays a third peak , associated with a zero mode , which is essentially nonperturbative in origin and dominates the spectral function at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the existence of this mode is a signal for the formation of a strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma and that this strongly - interacting state of matter is likely a distinctive feature of the qcd phase transition . </S>"
