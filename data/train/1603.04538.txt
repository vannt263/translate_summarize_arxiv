    "the two - dimensional electron gas that forms at the interface of the band insulators laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) and srtio@xmath0 ( sto)@xcite has attracted a great deal of attention due to the rich landscape of competing physical phenomena that have been observed , including superconductivity@xcite , magnetism@xcite , tunable spin - orbit interaction@xcite , gate - tunable superconductor - to - insulator transistions@xcite , and the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity@xcite .",
    "most studies so far have been on ( 001 ) oriented lao / sto , focusing both on the origins of the 2deg@xcite as well as the aforementioned phenomena",
    ". however , ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) lao / sto interfaces , which have different symmetries and consequently band structure , are just beginning to be explored,@xcite but detailed studies of ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) lao / sto interfaces as a function of gate voltage have not been reported .",
    "there are significant differences between the ( 001 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) oriented lao / sto interfaces that raise the possibility of interesting new behavior . specifically , the symmetries of the band structure at each interface are different .",
    "in particular , the orbitals at the ( 111 ) interface have hexagonal symmetry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a)),@xcite , with corresponding potentially novel properties.@xcite thus it is of interest to study the properties of the ( 111 ) lao / sto interface in detail .    from the point of view of crystal structure and sample morphology , it is not clear whether the properties of lao / sto structures of any crystal orientation should be isotropic or anisotropic , as there are strong arguments for both . for ( 111 )",
    "lao / sto interfaces , for example , there is a much larger overlap of the ti orbitals along the @xmath1 $ ] direction than along the @xmath2 $ ] direction ( see fig . [",
    "fig1](a)).@xcite consequently , it might be natural to expect anisotropy in the transport properties between the two directions , such as in the electrical conductance or perhaps even the hall coefficient , if multiple carrier bands are involved .",
    "however , for crystals with cubic symmetry , such as bulk sto at room temperature , the conductivity should be isotropic.@xcite on the other hand , bulk sto has a structural transition to a tetragonal phase at @xmath3105 k;@xcite in thin films , or in heterostructures with other materials ( e.g. , lao ) , the transition at this temperature may be to a crystal structure with lower symmetry . when the symmetry of the crystal structure is lowered , anisotropy in the properties is not surprising .",
    "finally , for highly disordered samples , as is the case for most of the lao / sto samples studied so far , any anisotropy might be expected to be averaged out due to scattering between electronic bands .",
    "anisotropic transport behavior has been reported in ( 110 ) lao / sto heterostructures,@xcite but not so far in ( 111 ) interface devices .",
    "we report here reproducible anisotropic behavior in the resistance and the hall coefficient of ( 111 ) lao / sto interface samples that only manifests itself at low temperatures ( @xmath34 k and below ) , suggesting that it is not associated with the structural transition that occurs at @xmath3105 k. in addition , we observe anisotropy in the capacitance , a quantity related to the density of states , and hence by definition a quantity that should be isotropic .",
    "the anisotropy in the properties ( electrical conductance , hall coefficient , capacitance ) is particularly pronounced below a certain threshold in the back gate voltage @xmath4 applied to the substrate .",
    "this suggests different band edges along the two directions at low temperatures , in contrast to the result from band structure calculations and and arpes measurements applicable at higher temperatures .",
    "the 20 monolayer ( ml ) ( 111 ) lao / sto interface samples used in this study were prepared by pulsed laser deposition using a krf laser ( @xmath5 = 248 nm ) .",
    "a lao single crystal target was used for deposition . during the deposition ,",
    "the laser repetition was kept at 1 hz , laser fluence at 1.8 j/@xmath6 , growth temperature at 650 c , and oxygen pressure at 1 mtorr .",
    "the deposition was monitored by in - situ reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) .    for the transport measurements ,",
    "hall bars were patterned using photolithography that defined an etch mask used for subsequent argon ion milling .",
    "the argon ion milling etched the unprotected areas to the bare sto , leaving the lao on top of the hall bars . a subsequent photolithography step deposited a au film on the electrical contacts to enable visual location of the contacts for wire - bonding .",
    "au was also deposited on the bare etched sto , which enabled us to measure the geometric capacitance as described below , and also to confirm that the bare sto itself did not become conducting after the ion milling step .",
    "six different sample chips were measured and showed similar behavior ; here we focus on measurements on one 5x5 mm@xmath7 chip on which four hall bars were fabricated , as shown in fig . [ fig1](b ) .",
    "the substrates were cut so that one edge was along the [ 1@xmath80 ] crystal direction , and the mutually orthogonal edge was along the [ @xmath9 crystal direction ; thus for two of the hall bars the measurement currents were along the [ 1@xmath80 ] direction , while for the other the measurement currents were along the [ @xmath9 direction .",
    "x - ray measurements were used to determine the actual crystal orientation , which is marked in fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) .",
    "while all four hall bars were measured , hall bars oriented along the same crystal direction had essentially identical measured properties .",
    "consequently , we show here data for only the two hall bars whose electrical contacts are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "figure [ srt](a ) shows an afm image of the surface of the lao / sto heterostructure .",
    "the hall bars were fabricated so that the current direction was oriented at 45@xmath10 to the atomic terraces shown in fig [ srt](a ) .",
    "the samples were measured in three different cryostats : a home - built liquid helium cryogenic insert , a kelvinox mx100 dilution refrigerator , and a kelvinox 300 dilution refrigerator , although apart from the data in fig . [ srt](b ) , the results reported here are only at liquid helium temperatures .",
    "all measurement rigs were equipped with superconducting solenoids that permitted measurement of the hall effect . to measure the electrical transport properties of the hall bars , an ac current of amplitude",
    "@xmath320 na was introduced using a home - built low - noise current source with output impedance @xmath11 @xmath12 , and the resulting longitudinal or transverse voltage was detected with a lock - in amplifier after being amplified by a factor of 10 or 100 by a home - built low noise voltage preamplifier . due to the very high resistances of the devices , particularly at low temperatures and negative @xmath4 , the ac excitation frequency was kept in the range of 1 - 2 hz .",
    "the samples were mounted using silver paste on an electrically isolated ofhc copper puck to which a voltage could be applied to gate the interface .",
    "it should be noted that all of the chips show the same qualitative behavior , and measurement of samples on different chips were quantitatively within 10% of each other .",
    "in addition to the longitudinal and hall resistances , we also measured the @xmath4 dependence of the capacitance @xmath13 between the back gate and each individual hall bar . in order to measure @xmath13 , we used a technique similar to one that has been previously used by other groups to measure the capacitance of gaas / algaas two - dimensional electron gases @xcite .",
    "a 100 mv ac voltage was superposed on the dc back - gate voltage @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ capref](a ) ) by summing a dc voltage and an ac voltage from the oscillator of an eg&g digital lock - in amplifier with a home - made summing amplifier , the output of which was used to drive a kepco 100/1 power supply / amplifier .",
    "the output of the kepco was then applied to the back - gate . for the other electrode",
    ", one contact of the hall bar was connected to the input of a home - made current preamplifier whose output was fed to the input of the lock - in amplifier .",
    "it was important to ensure that all other contacts of the hall bar as well as all other hall bars on the same chip remained open , so that the only current that could flow was to the current preamplifier .",
    "signals that were in phase and in quadrature with the ac voltage applied to the back gate were then monitored as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the kepco has a reasonably flat frequency response up until approximately 2.5 khz ; for the greatest sensitivity , we desired to operate at the highest frequency possible , hence the capacitance data for this work was taken at a frequency of 2.3 khz .",
    "we tested this measurement configuration on standard capacitors attached to our cryogenic inserts with values close to the measured capacitances of our sample , and the measured values agree within less than 1 % with their values measured on the bench with commercial capacitance bridges .",
    "in addition to ensuring that our measurement setup was accurate , this also indicated that the capacitance of the wires going down the cryogenic inserts do not significantly alter the measured capacitance .",
    "the detailed analysis in appendix [ capacitanceappendix ] shows that the component of the ac current in quadrature to the applied ac voltage is a direct measure of @xmath13 , and that the measured capacitance is not significantly affected by the resistance of the hall bar .",
    "of the [ @xmath14 and [ @xmath152 ] direction hall bars as a function of the back gate voltage @xmath4 .",
    "the sweep direction is marked by arrows .",
    "the green and blue curves show the average of the up and down sweeps for the two samples .",
    "( b ) logarithmic plot of @xmath16 vs @xmath4 at two different sweep rates for the @xmath2 $ ] sample .",
    "the black/(blue ) curve corresponds to a 16/(24 ) hour long sweep of the back gate with its averaged curve in green/(red ) .",
    "data taken at 4.4 k.,width=283 ]    [ gateh ]    we start by discussing the gate dependence of the longitudinal resistance .",
    "figure [ gateh](a ) shows the longitudinal sheet resistance @xmath17 of the two hall bars shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) at 4.4 k as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the first thing to note is that , similar to the ( 001 ) samples , @xmath17 vs. @xmath4 is strongly hysteretic : the resistance on sweeping up in @xmath4 is higher than the resistance on sweeping down in @xmath4 ; up - sweeps reproduced up - sweeps and down - sweeps reproduce down - sweeps if the sweep range and sweep rate remain the same .",
    "we find similar behavior in any measurement that involves sweeping the back gate voltage , in particular , the capacitance measurements discussed later . in addition , we find that if the gate voltage sweep is stopped at a particular value of @xmath4 , @xmath17 relaxes to a value corresponding to the average of the up- and down - sweep traces at that value of @xmath4 for that specific sweep rate . at millikelvin temperatures , this relaxation can take place over hours or even days , particularly at large negative @xmath4 .",
    "we speculate that this glassy behavior is due to states that relax slowly to lower energy configurations over very long time scales .",
    "this is rather surprising , as one might expect such processes to be frozen out at millikelvin temperatures .",
    "we plan to return to this interesting issue later .",
    "for the present study , we take advantage of our experimental observation that as the sweep rate is slowed , the hysteresis loops narrow , but the average of the up- and down - sweeps remain the same .",
    "this is shown in fig.[gateh](b ) , which shows two different @xmath18 vs. @xmath4 hysteresis loops taken over 16 hours and 24 hours , and the respective averages over the up and down sweeps , which are essentially identical .",
    "thus , the averaged curves are measures of the long - term behavior of the devices .",
    "similar behavior is observed for the gate dependent capacitance measurements .",
    "consequently , in what follows , we shall present averaged curves for the @xmath4 dependence of the longitudinal resistance ( as shown in fig . [ gateh](a ) ) and the capacitance .",
    "the hall data are taken at specific values of @xmath4 after the sample has relaxed , so such averaging is not required .",
    "returning now to the longitudinal resistance as a function of @xmath4 shown in fig [ gateh](a ) , the most striking aspect of the data is that the resistance is highly anisotropic : while the resistances of both hall bars are roughly the same at large positive @xmath4 , they start to diverge at small positive @xmath4 , and differ by more than a factor of 6 at @xmath19 v. this difference is even larger at millikelvin temperatures , with the resistance in the [ @xmath9 direction changing little , while the resistance in the [ @xmath14 direction increasing substantially with decreasing temperature , as seen in fig [ srt](b ) .",
    "a longitudinal resistance that depends on crystalline direction has been seen earlier in both ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) lao / sto interface samples .",
    "et al . _ found a strong directional dependence of the resistivity on ( 001 ) lao / sto interfaces grown on lsat that was associated with step edges in the underlying lsat substrate@xcite the resistance measured along the step edges was significantly larger than the resistance measured perpendicular to the step edges .",
    "the difference was largest at low temperatures , but still appreciable at room temperature .",
    "et al . _ observed a weak anisotropy@xcite associated with the channeling of currents along microstructural channels that changed on warming above the cubic to orthorhombic transition that occurs in sto at @xmath3 105 k. gopinadhan _",
    "et al . _ observed a weak anisotropy in the mobility of ( 110 ) samples at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "in contrast to these previous observations , the anisotropy in the electrical characteristics of our ( 111 ) samples does not exist at room temperature or liquid nitrogen temperatures , and is reproducible even after repeated warming to room temperature .",
    "further evidence of anisotropic behavior can be found in the hall coefficient @xmath18 , which we determine by measuring the hall resistance in a magnetic field @xmath20 applied perpendicular to the plane of the sample as a function of @xmath4 . in the range",
    "@xmath21 mt , the measured hall resistance is linear .",
    "we define the hall coefficient @xmath18 as the slope of the hall resistance vs. @xmath20 .    the solid symbols in fig .",
    "[ hallpreuv ] show @xmath18 as a function of @xmath4 for both hall bars .",
    "the magnitude and overall trend of @xmath18 is the same for both crystal orientations , but the detailed dependence on @xmath4 is different : while @xmath22 for the [ @xmath9 direction saturates at large positive @xmath4 and decreases rapidly at negative @xmath4 , @xmath22 for the [ @xmath14 direction shows a roughly linear dependence , with a reproducible jump in @xmath22 between @xmath23 v and @xmath24 v. the overall trend is similar to what was observed by dikin _",
    "_ in ( 001 ) interface samples , but is in contrast with the work done on ( 001 ) by joshua et al .",
    "@xcite , who found that @xmath18 increases both at high positive @xmath4 as well as large negative @xmath4 .    for a single band of charge carriers , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the areal density of the carriers , and",
    "the sign of @xmath18 is indicative of the sign of the carrier charge .",
    "the sign of @xmath18 in our samples at all @xmath4 is electron - like , but the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath4 is not as expected for a single band of electrons .",
    "as @xmath4 is increased , one expects that more electrons would be drawn to the interface , so that the electron density @xmath27 would increase .",
    "the increase in @xmath27 should lead to a decrease in the longitudinal resistance , as we observe , but it should also lead to a decrease in @xmath28 with increasing @xmath4 . instead , an _ increase _ in @xmath22 with @xmath4 is observed for both hall bars .",
    "we note that in earlier experiments on ( 001 ) lao / sto samples , similar anomalous ( and in some cases nonmonotonic ) dependences of @xmath18 on @xmath4 @xcite was ascribed to multiple electron bands with different mobilities .",
    "although we agree that the presence of multiple bands is required to explain the anomalous dependence , we can not see how one can fit the @xmath4 dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ hallpreuv ] with only _ electron _ bands , without making the unphysical assumption that the occupation of at least one of the electron bands decreases with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , as discussed below , @xmath18 almost vanishes at large @xmath4 after ultraviolet irradiation , suggesting a compensated system .",
    "thus we are lead to the conclusion that in addition to any electron bands , at least one hole band must contribute to the electrical transport properties of our samples .    to model the qualitative @xmath4 dependence of @xmath18 , we fit the data to the simplest two - band model with one electron band and one hole band : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the hall coefficients and @xmath31 are the conductivities of the electrons and holes respectively . here",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corresponding areal densities and mobilities . to analyze the gate dependence of the hall coefficients shown in fig .",
    "[ hallpreuv ] and [ fig3 ] we assume that the electron and hole densities @xmath27 and @xmath34 have a linear dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "we also make the simplifying assumption that the mobilities of the electrons and holes @xmath35 and @xmath36 are independent of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , there are nominally 6 parameters that can be varied to obtain a fit of @xmath18 as a function of @xmath4 : the values of @xmath27 and @xmath34 at @xmath4 = 0 , the assumed linear slopes @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the mobilities @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we use the measured value of the 2d conductivity @xmath39 as a function of @xmath4 to reduce the number of parameters by one , since @xmath40 + @xmath41 = @xmath42 , using as a 5th fitting parameter the ratio of mobilities @xmath43 = @xmath35/@xmath36 , subject to the constraint that @xmath27(@xmath44 + @xmath45 = @xmath46 .",
    "the parameters obtained from the fits are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     band structure calculations and arpes data from other groups indicate that the bottom of the conduction bands in both directions should be at the same energy , so that one might expect to see similar gradual changes in both directions until the common band edge is reached",
    ". however , these calculations are applicable to higher temperatures : the band structure calculations are based on room temperature crystal structure , and the lowest arpes measurements were performed at 20 k. our measurements at higher temperatures show little or no anisotropy , and hence are consistent with these band structure calculations and arpes measurements .",
    "however , we believe our data suggests that , at low temperature , the band edge in the [ @xmath14 direction is at higher energy than the band edge in the [ @xmath9 direction , and that conduction below the band edge is determined by transport through defect states .",
    "further evidence of this point of view can be seen in the change in the measured characteristics of the devices ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath13 ) after irradiation with ultraviolet ( uv ) light .",
    "historically , irradiation by uv has been conducted in vacuum@xcite .",
    "this irradiation has been shown via transport@xcite , arpes@xcite , and photoluminescence@xcite to cause an increase in the oxygen vacancies in the sample , which gives a corresponding increase in the carrier density as each oxygen vacancy donates two electrons to the interface .",
    "the increase in electrons at the interface yields a lower longitudinal resistance at the interface .",
    "in contrast , annealing at elevated temperatures in o@xmath47 has been shown to decrease the oxygen vacancies thereby increasing the resistance at the interface@xcite . in the present case",
    ", we have irradiated the samples ( after making the measurements discussed above ) using a uv source placed 1 mm above the samples .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the sample resistance at room temperature , the extent of the increase depending on the exposure time . since this is similar in effect to what happens with o@xmath47 annealing , we speculate that atmospheric oxygen is introduced into the sample in the form of ozone , reducing the number of oxygen vacancies .",
    "the effect is transient at room temperature : the sample regains its original resistance over a period of minutes to hours , depending on the initial exposure time .",
    "however , the induced change persists if the sample is immediately cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperatures . for the current study",
    ", we irradiated the sample for 15 minutes under these conditions , which increased the room temperature sheet resistance from 22.15 k@xmath12 to 33.66 k@xmath12 .",
    "after exposure , the samples were cooled down as soon as possible to liquid nitrogen temperatures for measurement .",
    "this treatment appears to disproportionately affect transport in the [ @xmath14 direction for @xmath48 v. figure [ fig3 ] shows a comparison of the data for the two crystal directions before and after 15 minutes of uv irradiation .",
    "( the data for before uv irradiation are the same as that shown in figs .",
    "[ gateh](a ) , [ hallpreuv ] and [ capref](c ) . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the resistance in both directions at negative @xmath4 after uv irradiation increases . in the [ @xmath14 direction , the pre- and post - uv sheet resistances start to diverge significantly below @xmath49 v , while the difference in the pre / post uv @xmath17 for the [ @xmath9 direction grows steadily over the entire @xmath4 range .",
    "more notable differences can be seen in @xmath18 and @xmath13 .",
    "while @xmath18 for the [ @xmath9 direction shows little change after uv treatment , @xmath18 for the [ @xmath14 direction starts to decrease in comparison with the pre - uv values for @xmath50 v : at @xmath51 v , @xmath18 is close to 0 .",
    "however , the changes in @xmath13 are the most striking . for the [ @xmath9 direction , @xmath13 before and after uv exposure is approximately the same , except for a small range of @xmath4 above 65 v. for the [ @xmath14 direction , however , @xmath13 drops off sharply as one goes from positive to negative @xmath4 , indicating a corresponding drop in @xmath52 at around @xmath53 v , the same voltage range at which the differences between pre- and post - uv in the measured @xmath18 and @xmath17 become apparent .",
    "( note that here , comparison of the magnitudes of @xmath13 are meaningful , as the data are for the same hall bar , and @xmath54 has not changed . )",
    "these data strongly suggest that the number of electrons available to participate in transport at @xmath48 v for the [ @xmath14 direction decreases substantially after uv irradiation .",
    "this strengthens our speculation that we reach the band edge at higher @xmath4 for the [ @xmath14 direction in comparison to the [ @xmath9 direction ; the differences in pre- and post - uv measurements suggest further that the states that contribute to conduction below the band edge are reduced by the uv treatment .",
    "we have shown a clear and surprising anisotropy at the ( 111 ) lao / sto interface between hall bars fabricated along the orthogonal [ @xmath14 and [ @xmath9 directions .",
    "specifically , we have found that the this anisotropy can be tuned via the application of @xmath4 . as @xmath4 is tuned to high positive voltage ,",
    "pushing carriers to the interface , both directions have similar longitudinal resistances , hall characteristics , and capacitances . however ,",
    "when @xmath4 is tuned to large negative voltages , the longitudinal resistance , hall coefficients and capacitance differ significantly along the two mutually orthogonal crystal directions .",
    "this anisotropy can be made much stronger by irradiating the sample with uv light , but interestingly , the voltage range over which the anisotropy becomes significant ( @xmath55v ) stays the same .",
    "our observations are reproduced across multiple sample chips grown in different growth runs , with different substrate preparations and on different cooldowns , showing that the anisotropy is not due to structural changes associated with growth conditions , but is an intrinsic property of the ( 111 ) lao / sto interface .",
    "the fact that we do not observe anisotropy at 77 k , below the sto structural transition temperature of 105 k , also indicates that the anisotropy observed at liquid helium temperatures and below is also not solely associated with this structural transition , although the lowering of the crystal symmetry associated with the transition may play a role .    as we noted above",
    ", the data suggest that the anisotropy arises from a difference in the conduction band edge along the two crystalline directions .",
    "other groups have reported splitting of the bands at the band minima due to spin - orbit interactions in ( 001 ) @xcite and ( 110 ) @xcite lao / sto heterostructures . on the other hand , band structure calculations@xcite and arpes@xcite data on ( 111 )",
    "heterostructures from other groups indicate that the bottom of the conduction bands in both directions should be at the same energy , so that one might expect to see similar gradual changes in both directions until the common band edge is reached .",
    "however , these calculations and measurements were for samples at room temperature or 20k : our data indicate that there might be a change in the band structure at liquid helium temperatures that accounts for our observations .",
    "thus , it is quite likely that a band splitting might develop at lower temperatures in the(111 ) lao / sto heterostructures as well .",
    "in addition , we have observed evidence for hole like carrier contributions to the transport properties in hall bars along both crystal directions at the ( 111 ) interface .",
    "the strongest evidence for this contribution comes from the dependence of the hall coefficient , @xmath18 , as a function of @xmath4 : @xmath18 increases over the measured voltage range of -40 to 80v , and this behavior can not be explained solely by a multiple electron model .",
    "this dependence can only be explained if there is a contribution from at least one hole band , which may arise from defect acceptor levels just above the valence band edge that have been described in earlier work.@xcite    we would like to thank varada bal for performing the initial photo - lithography steps , and andy millis for useful discussions .",

    "<S> the conducting gas that forms at the interface between laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 has proven to be a fertile playground for a wide variety of physical phenomena . </S>",

    "<S> we report detailed measurements of the low - temperature electrical properties of ( 111 ) lao / sto interface samples . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the low - temperature electrical transport properties are highly anisotropic , in that they differ significantly along two mutually orthogonal crystal orientations at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> while anisotropy in the resistivity has been reported in some ( 001 ) samples and in ( 110 ) samples , the anisotropy in the ( 111 ) samples reported here is much stronger , and also manifests itself in the hall coefficient as well as the capacitance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the anisotropy is not present at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperatures , but only at liquid helium temperatures and below . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy is accentuated by exposure to ultraviolet light , which disproportionately affects transport along one surface crystal direction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , analysis of the low - temperature hall coefficient and the capacitance as a function of back gate voltage indicates that in addition to electrons , holes contribute to the electrical transport .    </S>",
