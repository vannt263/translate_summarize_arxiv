    "there exist a number of physical systems whose energetics is fully described by a surface hamiltonian .",
    "the easiest and best known examples involve capillary phenomena @xcite , where the shape of a liquid - fluid interface ( such as a sessile water droplet or the shape of a fluid meniscus ) is determined by minimizing its area .",
    "the same physics governs the behavior of soap films .",
    "higher order surface properties , notably its curvature , play a role in the description of fluid lipid membranes or microemulsions @xcite , and even higher derivatives have been implicated in the occurrence of certain corrugated membrane phases @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the shape of the surface follows from minimizing the surface hamiltonian , a variational problem .",
    "the corresponding euler - lagrange differential equations are known as the shape equations .    however , such surfaces are generally not isolated but rather in contact with something else .",
    "water droplets or lipid membrane vesicles may rest on a substrate , and this generally influences their shape quite strongly . for instance , water droplets on hydrophilic substrates ( _ _ e.__@xmath0_g .",
    "_  clean glass ) resemble flat contact lenses , while on very hydrophobic substrates ( _ _ e.__@xmath0_g .",
    "_  teflon ) they are almost completely spherical .",
    "when gravity can be neglected @xcite , the shape equation dictates a constant mean curvature surface in both cases ( in fact , a spherical cap ) , but the _ contact angle _ at the three - phase line where water and substrate meet is different for the two different substrates .",
    "in the majority of cases the spatial extension of the surface being studied exceeds the range of interaction between it and some substrate by a large amount .",
    "for instance , van der waals forces , hydrophobic interactions , or ( screened ) electrostatic forces typically extend over several nanometers , while the extensions of vesicles or droplets can be microns or even millimeters . under these conditions the interaction is well approximated by a _ contact energy _ ,",

    "it is this adhesion energy , together with the energy parameters characterizing the contacting surfaces , which determines the boundary conditions holding at the contact line . in the case of capillary phenomena for example",
    "the ratio between adhesion energy @xmath1 and surface tension @xmath2 determines the contact angle @xmath3 between liquid and substrate surface by means of the well - known young - dupr equation @xcite @xmath4    the `` standard '' derivation of this result involves a balance of tangential forces at the contact line . yet , despite being very intuitive , this requirement of surface stress balance does not yield the correct condition for more complicated surface hamiltonians , _ even _ if the concept of surface stress is generalized properly .",
    "higher order hamiltonians give rise to additional energy contributions when the contact line is varied .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article to show how these contributions can be accounted for in a systematic and parametrization - free way , and without assuming any additional symmetries ( such as axisymmetry or translation symmetry along the contact line ) .",
    "we study adhesion to rigid substrates as well as to deformable surfaces also characterized by a surface hamiltonian .",
    "our presentation generalizes and strongly simplifies the analysis previously given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in order to describe the adhering surfaces in a parametrization - free way , we use a covariant differential geometric language .",
    "our notation is essentially standard and will follow the one used in refs .",
    "briefly , a surface @xmath5 is described by the embedding function @xmath6 , where the @xmath7 @xmath8 are a suitable set of local coordinates on the surface .",
    "this induces two local tangent vectors @xmath9 and a normal vector satisfying @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the two fundamental forms of the surface are needed , namely ( @xmath12 ) the metric tensor @xmath13 and ( @xmath14 ) the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath15 .",
    "the symbol @xmath16 is the metric - compatible covariant derivative .",
    "the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor will be denoted by @xmath17 , which for a sphere of radius @xmath18 with outward pointing normal vector is positive and has the value @xmath19 . as usual ,",
    "indices are lowered or raised with the metric or its inverse , respectively , and a repeated index @xmath12 ( one up , one down ) implies a summation over @xmath20 .",
    "more background on differential geometry can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .      by `` contact line '' we will denote the curve @xmath21 at which the surface detaches from the substrate .",
    "its local direction is given by the tangent vector @xmath22 ( see fig .  [",

    "what follows ( with the exception of sec .",
    "[ ssec : adhesion_deformable ] ) we will use underlining in order to indicate quantities referring to the substrate .     two vectors exist , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are tangential to surface @xmath5 and substrate @xmath23 , respectively . ]",
    "perpendicular to @xmath21 we can define local normal vectors which are either tangential to @xmath5 or @xmath23 , namely @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : general ] ) . also , we will have two surface normals @xmath28 and @xmath29 . if the surface contacts the substrate at zero contact angle , we will have @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 there ; however , their _ derivatives _ perpendicular to the contact line need not coincide , since the curvatures of surface and substrate generally need not be identical .",
    "in fact , the values of perpendicular and parallel components of these curvatures ( and possibly their higher derivatives ) will be among the primary focus of this paper .",
    "they will be denoted by    @xmath33    where we also introduced the two directional surface derivatives perpendicular and parallel to @xmath21 , @xmath34 notice that we can analogously define @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .      in the present work",
    "we will exclusively study surfaces whose energy @xmath38 is given by a surface integral over a scalar energy density @xmath39 , which is constructed from the local surface geometry : @xmath40 the integral extends over the entire surface @xmath5 , and the area element @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the metric determinant .",
    "for those parts of the surface which adhere to a substrate we will assume an additional adhesion energy density @xmath44 which may in general be a function of position .",
    "as we will see , the adhesion balance between surface and substrate will result in a discontinuous change of some surface property across the contact line .",
    "however , the form of the energy density restricts which quantities can be discontinuous , since it needs to remain integrable .",
    "most obviously , the shape itself has to be continuous . yet ,",
    "already its first derivative may display a jump , as it does in the case of capillary adhesion .",
    "the energy density is given simply by @xmath45 and a kink in the surface at the contact line , _",
    "_ i.__@xmath0_e .",
    "_  a finite contact angle , is not associated with an extra energy .    for curvature elastic surfaces",
    "the situation is different .",
    "there , the energy density of the surface is given by the well known expression @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the bending modulus ( with units of energy ) and @xmath48 describes a spontaneous curvature of the elastic surface @xcite .",
    "a kink in the surface at the contact line implies a @xmath49-singularity in the curvature , whose square is non - integrable .",
    "hence , the surface needs to be differentiable across the contact line , and the distinction between surface- and substrate tangents and normals drawn in sec .  [",
    "sec : geom_at_cl ] becomes unnecessary .",
    "moreover , a quick glance at eqns .",
    "( [ eq : k_par],[eq : k_perp_par ] ) shows that both @xmath50 and the off - diagonal curvature @xmath51 is expressible as a tangential derivative along the curve @xmath21 of a quantity continuous across @xmath21 , hence both these curvatures will also be continuous .",
    "it is only the perpendicular curvature component @xmath52 which might possess a discontinuity , and indeed we will see that it does .    finally , even higher order derivatives might occur in surface hamiltonians .",
    "for instance , goetz and helfrich have studied a curvature - gradient term of the form @xmath53 which in a generalized higher - curvature hamiltonian prevents the occurrence of infinitely sharp curvature changes @xcite . in this case",
    "it is obvious that all curvature components have to be continuous along the substrate , since otherwise again a squared @xmath49-singularity results .",
    "moreover , most of the first order directional derivatives are automatically continuous : the parallel ones , @xmath54 , again differentiate quantities along @xmath21 which are continuous across @xmath21 and thus are itself continuous . for the perpendicular ones it turns out that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are continuous , while @xmath57 is not .",
    "this is intuitively reasonable , since every term involving a `` @xmath58 '' features at least one less derivative across the contact line and thus can not jump .",
    "a rigorous proof is however a bit more involved .",
    "one may for instance proceed like this : start with the contracted codazzi - mainardi equation @xcite @xmath59 and project onto @xmath60 . by decomposing the resulting identity into the local @xmath61 frame",
    ", it can be cast in the form latexmath:[\\[\\nabla_\\perp k_{|| } = \\nabla_{||}k_{\\perp || } + ( k_\\perp - k_{||}){{\\boldsymbol{t}}}\\cdot\\nabla_{||}{{\\boldsymbol{l}}}+2k_{\\perp      for an adhering surface the total energy is stationary with respect to variations of the contact line along the substrate .",
    "such a variation contributes twofold to the hamiltonian : assume that locally the contact line is moved such that a bit of surface unbinds from the substrate .",
    "this removes its corresponding binding energy , as well as any elastic energy associated with the constraint of conforming to the substrate , and thus gives rise to an energy change @xmath65 . on the other hand ,",
    "the unbound part of the surface acquires at the contact line a new boundary strip which implies also a change @xmath66 in its elastic energy .",
    "the boundary condition at the contact line then follows from the stationarity condition @xmath67 in the case of adhesion to a rigid substrate the bound contribution involves the variation along a surface of known shape .",
    "the corresponding term is thus conceptually very different from a deformable substrate or even the free variation , because in both these cases the local shape of the surface is not known .",
    "below we will see how these differences manifest themselves when computing the boundary terms .      for definiteness ,",
    "let the normal @xmath25 to the contact line @xmath21 be directed _ towards _ the adhering portion of the surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : general ] ) .",
    "a local infinitesimal normal displacement @xmath68 of the contact line along a rigid substrate thus implies the following obvious change in the bound part of the surface : @xmath69 the underlining of @xmath39 should again indicate that it is evaluated with geometric surface scalars ( such as for instance curvatures ) pertaining to the _",
    "substrate_. if the substrate is flexible , the @xmath1 term remains , but the change in elastic energy will instead be taken care of by an additional free boundary variation .",
    "the change in energy due to the addition or removal of _ unbound _ parts to the boundaries of the surface is identical to the boundary terms in the variation of the free surface . in ref .",

    "( [ eq : hab],[eq : tab ] ) .",
    "while their determination is not particularly involved , these calculations have been performed previously by us @xcite and we will thus simply reuse the results here .",
    "since the variation of the contact line has to proceed along the substrate , we must have @xmath79 no component in @xmath80 direction is necessary , since for fluid surfaces this would merely amount to a reparametrization of @xmath21 .",
    "notice that ( [ eq : deltax_substrate ] ) is nothing but the lie derivative of @xmath81 along the substrate , since @xmath82 .",
    "this property holds generally , and we will make use of it later .",

    "we will assume that they do it in such a way that differentiability of the surfaces is implied ( see sec .",

    "we then find @xmath84 where in the last step the equation of weingarten @xcite has been used ; this is again the lie derivative along the substrate @xcite .",
    "notice that there still remains a distinction between _ curvatures _ of substrate and surface ; hence , the derivative of the tangent vectors resulting from a variation _ along the substrate _ yields the _ substrate _ curvature and not the free surface curvature .      in this case",

    "quite remarkably , this boundary condition depends neither on the spontaneous curvature @xmath48 , nor on the local parallel curvature @xmath50 .",
    "it would also remain unaffected if the bilayer were under a finite tension @xmath2 .",
    "formally , it is easily seen to cancel ; physically , the reason is that the jump we would expect from the young - dupr equation ( [ eq : youngdupre ] ) can not materialize since the curvature terms in the energy density enforce differentiability of the profile at @xmath21 .",

    "here is why : when calculating @xmath77 and @xmath78 to obtain eqns .",
    "( [ eq : habf_grad ] ) , we varied the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_grad ] ) with respect to @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , and identified the _ bulk _ terms ( see sec . 4 in the appendix of ref .",
    "these variations also leave _ boundary _ terms , since the curvature @xmath106 appears differentiated . for the purpose of identifying @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "they are irrelevant , but they evidently matter now that we are interested in the total energy change upon displacing the boundary .",
    "moreover , the auxiliary framework introduced in ref .  @xcite teaches us that the @xmath107 and @xmath108 variations are indeed independent from the @xmath74 and @xmath109 terms already included in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : free_variation ] ) , so they can be simply added there . if we go through the calculation , we see that the two tensor variations can be nicely combined into a single scalar one , since they occur in the combination @xmath110 , and we end up with the additional boundary contribution @xmath111 this is of course exactly the boundary term we would expect for the variation of a hamiltonian density whose functional form is the square of the gradient of a scalar , so everything is consistent .    to evaluate the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : deltak_variation ] ) , note that the variation is once more given by the lie - derivative along the substrate .",

    "the boundary condition following from this specifies a jump in the perpendicular _ derivative _ of the perpendicular curvature @xmath115 the similarity with eqn .",

    "( [ eq : deltak_variation ] ) , which is absent in the simple curvature square case , is essential .",
    "compared to the previous section , there are two key differences if the substrate is not rigid .",
    "first , the absence of a known substrate shape along which a certain amount of deformation energy is to be paid removes the term involving @xmath116 in the bound variation ( [ eq : bound : variation ] ) .",
    "second , for the same reason the contact line variation is no longer restricted to proceed along a substrate and will thus be of the more general form @xmath117 the corresponding tangent vector variation , which occurs if @xmath76 , then leaves a term @xmath118 note that @xmath119 plays a different role here than previously .",
    "it no longer describes the curvature of the evidently nonexistent substrate .",
    "rather , the tangential variation may proceed locally along a _ fictitious _ surface which is tangential to the other three surfaces that meet at the contact line .",
    "encoding higher order derivative information necessary here , @xmath119 describes the curvature of that fictitious surface , and @xmath35 is the component perpendicular to @xmath21 ( see fig .",

    "this surface is of course not unique , and thus @xmath35 is arbitrary  just as the two variations @xmath120 and @xmath121 themselves .",
    "the simplest example of a three phase line between deformable surfaces occurs when three capillary interfaces meet , for instance at the three - phase - line between three mutually immiscible liquids 1 , 2 , and 3 , having mutual surface tensions @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in this case",
    "no adhesion energy is involved ( or , alternatively , it may be considered as part of the surface tension ) .",
    "the contact line variation thus consists of three identical boundary variations @xmath125 from which we immediately find the boundary condition @xmath126 this expresses nothing but the force balance between the three directional line tensions @xmath127 etc .  and is known as the _",

    "we assume that vesicle 1 has bending modulus @xmath129 and tension @xmath130 , while vesicle 2 has corresponding values @xmath131 and @xmath132 . _",
    "if _ the two bilayers can slide past each other in the region where they adhere , their joint bending modulus is given by @xmath133 , because the energies required to bend either one just add ; the same applies to the tension : @xmath134 .",

    "since the last two terms have identical prefactors , we finally end up with three boundary conditions :    [ eq : v_adhesion_abc ] @xmath138    notice that three conditions is just what we need in order to fix three curvatures . yet , contrary to the case of vesicle adhesion to a substrate , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : contact_curvature_condition ] ) , these conditions also contain one which involves _ derivatives _ of the curvatures , namely ( [ eq : v_adhesion_c ] ) .",
    "the origin of this term stems from the @xmath121-variation , which is forbidden for the case of a rigid substrate .",
    "since the normal variation also multiplies the normal component of the stress tensor , which ( as eqn .",

    "first , if @xmath142 , the second vesicle approaches the limit of a rigid substrate . in this case eqn .",
    "( [ eq : v_adhesion_sym_b ] ) shows that @xmath143 and eqn .",
    "( [ eq : v_adhesion_sym_a ] ) reduces to the old contact - curvature - condition we had just derived for rigid substrates , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : contact_curvature_condition ] ) . and the curvature of this effective substrate is determined from @xmath144 .",
    "this latter condition shows that the `` substrate''-curvature is even differentiable across @xmath21  or , in other words , the `` substrate '' shape is a three times continuously differentiable function .",
    "and second , if the two membranes have identical bending moduli @xmath145 , a `` symmetrized '' contact curvature condition ensues which reads @xmath146 which tells us that the ( squared ) curvature jump @xmath147 demanded by the rigid substrate version ( [ eq : contact_curvature_condition ] ) is shared between the two membranes , while the final condition becomes @xmath148 .",
    "we have shown how the boundary conditions pertaining to the contact line between a fluid surface adhering to a solid substrate or another deformable surface can be extracted from a systematic boundary variation in a completely parametrization independent way .",
    "we would like to close with a summary of our main results and some remarks :    * integrability of the surface energy density @xmath39 enforces continuity of certain geometric variables across the contact line . *",
    "the highest derivative in @xmath39 thus dictates which geometric variables may change discontinuously across @xmath21 in response to adhesion .",
    "hence , for the helfrich hamiltonian the tension @xmath2 does not enter the boundary condition even if it enters @xmath39 ; likewise , neither tension @xmath2 nor bending modulus @xmath47 enter the boundary condition if also a gradient - curvature - squared term is present in @xmath39 . *",
    "higher order derivatives in @xmath39 create boundary terms in the variation which pick up surface variations that are one order lower .",
    "if the curvature enters @xmath39 , then a change in slope is noticed , if a gradient in curvature enters @xmath39 , then changes in curvature are noticed .",
    "for this reason the capillary hamiltonian is the _ only one _ which only picks up translations , such that the energy minimization can be reinterpreted as a force balance . in all other cases higher derivative deformations ( such as torques or even more complicated constructs )",

    "* generalizations to surfaces hosting additional scalar or vector fields ( such as composition or tilt order ) appear straightforward , since these are readily incorporated into the present framework @xcite . * to be sure , knowing the boundary conditions does not mean that one also knows the position of the contact line .",

    "<S> when a fluid surface adheres to a substrate , the location of the contact line adjusts in order to minimize the overall energy . this adhesion balance implies boundary conditions which depend on the characteristic surface deformation energies . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a general geometrical framework within which these conditions can be systematically derived . </S>",
    "<S> we treat both adhesion to a rigid substrate as well as adhesion between two fluid surfaces , and illustrate our general results for several important hamiltonians involving both curvature and curvature gradients . </S>",
    "<S> some of these have previously been studied using very different techniques , others are to our knowledge new . </S>",
    "<S> what becomes clear in our approach is that , except for capillary phenomena , these boundary conditions are _ not _ the manifestation of a local force balance , even if the concept of surface stress is properly generalized . </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonians containing higher order surface derivatives are not just sensitive to boundary translations but also notice changes in slope or even curvature . both the necessity and the functional form of the corresponding additional contributions follow readily from our treatment . </S>"
