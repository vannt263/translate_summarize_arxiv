    "the theoretical description of the spallation process is essential in understanding better the physical mechanism of each of the mentioned cases .",
    "several dynamical models have been constructed for the theoretical description of spallation process @xcite .",
    "all of them have the same basis , they describe the reaction as a cascade of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions , but employing different assumptions .",
    "the main difference concerns implementing mean field dynamics .",
    "one can distinguish the simplest models , which neglect features of the mean field dynamics and employ constant static potential , like a class of intra - nuclear cascade ( inc ) models @xcite .",
    "other , more sophisticated approaches comprise changing field and real fluctuations obtained due to use of two and three body potentials e.g. , quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) models @xcite . boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) type models use both non - relativistic and relativistic mean field potentials @xcite . an important advantage of relativistic mean field models is the distinct separation of scalar and vector lorentz - components of the nuclear mean field potential .",
    "the scalar part is associated with the in - medium dependence of the effective mass ( dirac mass ) , while the vector one changes the properties of the particle momenta inside the hadronic environment .",
    "this separation between scalar and vector self energies is very useful when extending mean field models to asymmetric nuclear matter , in which the role of isovector mesons can be clearly associated with the in - medium properties , symmetry potentials and effective masses of protons and neutrons .    in this work",

    "the rbuu model is found to be a useful tool in describing the time evolution of the nucleus - nucleus reaction dynamics @xcite . as a genuine feature of transport theories it has two important ingredients : a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) based on quantum hadrodynamics @xcite and isospin effects that account for the elastic and inelastic channels in resonance production and decay ( cf .",

    "the isovector part of nl - rmf is also characterized by a competition between vector ( @xmath5-meson ) and scalar ( @xmath6-meson ) fields , which is responsible for the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that , the scalar nature of the @xmath6-meson leads even to a new interesting effect , important in the reaction dynamics , the splitting of the neutron and proton effective masses in isospin asymmetric systems .",
    "the numerical values of the field parameters , fixed to nuclear matter and symmetry energy at saturation , are chosen similar to the qmd parameters for a better comparison with the results presented in @xcite .",

    "as one can see , calculations with different transition times yield the same results in the low energy neutron region @xmath106 .",
    "this may indicate that the decay processes of the excited prefragments described by rbuu+sm are equivalent in a @xmath96 choice from 60 to 100 fm / c .",
    "this is important for the study of the symmetry term dependence of this component of the neutron spectrum presented in the next section .    on the other hand , in the `` cascade region '' ( see later ) , @xmath107 , a systematic difference between the calculations is seen as the angle increases .",
    "this difference decreases within the time interval from 75 to 100 fm / c .",
    "we observe that the neutron data , in this energy range , are better reproduced by the rbuu+sm at @xmath108 .",
    "we , thus , use this value for all systems in the present study , which is also supported by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    it should be pointed out here that in the sm model , standard symmetry coefficients @xmath109 to 25 mev of the fragment binding energy are used to describe light and heavy fragments produced in proton / nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the symmetry energies within the different parameterizations used in the transport model may differ from those used in the statistical approach for densities beyond saturation .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to examine the consequences of changing @xmath110 in sm calculations , as has been done in different studies that focused on isotopic distributions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "[ fig3a ] displays the evaporation neutron spectra obtained using rbuu ( with nl)+sm calculations for p+pb reactions at 0.8 gev , and the symmetry term @xmath110 was varied between 5 to 25 mev . as one can see , with @xmath111 mev , the sm processes causes a slight increase of low energy neutrons at @xmath112 mev . for larger values of @xmath110 , however , the evaporation neutron spectra are not much affected by the symmetry coefficient difference in the sm code .",
    "we note that at variance with the heavy ion collisions studies of refs.[36 - 38 ] in our case we do not have large compression - expansion effects .",
    "the final equilibrated source is then at densities close to the saturation value .",
    "this has been checked analyzing the time evolution of the root mean square radius of the composite system in the ( p+pb ) case at 0.8 gev .",
    "after the thermal expansion the system shows a rather good stability with smooth monopole oscillations , see also ref .",
    "this may imply that the equilibrating source is formed at about normal nuclear density and it is not necessary to use much reduced symmetry coefficients .",

    "these peaks are less pronounced at @xmath8 and are insignificant at @xmath9 and larger . the ( quasi - elastic ) peak , characterized by a narrow peak at a kinetic energy near that of the beam energy , is due to a single ( @xmath118 ) elastic scattering in the forward direction .",
    "the ( quasi - inelastic ) peak , centered around @xmath119 and @xmath120 at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , is about @xmath121 wide and is thought to be due to @xmath62-resonance excitation .",

    "it is interesting to see that without statistical decay the `` low energy shoulder '' is absolutely missed . for the more neutron - rich pb target",
    "some difference originating from the @xmath5-meson becomes more pronounced in the lower part of the neutron energy spectrum ( below 30 mev ) , especially with increasing emission angle .",
    "such behaviour can be related to the difference in the symmetry energy : neutrons experience a stronger repulsive field going from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , at any density ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "in fact the largest isospin effects are observed just on the low energy evaporation component which appears when the afterburner statistical decay is included . in figs .",

    "the properties of these prefragments at the final stage of the interactions ( at 75 fm / c ) are affected by the number of pre - equilibrium neutrons ( @xmath132 ) emitted at the earlier times : less @xmath132 leads to larger excitation energy and larger n / z of the prefragment . the @xmath1 calculations of the p+pb interactions at 1.2 gev show , in fig",

    "is obtained within the @xmath1 choice , which corresponds to a rather stiff increase of the symmetry energy below saturation , roughly proportional to the total density .",
    "it is also interesting to notice ( see figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig9 ] ) that the @xmath0 and @xmath2 give similar extra yields with respect to the @xmath1 case , which implies that the excitation energies and n / z of the pb hot prefragments are similar .",
    "this can be also explained by considering the weaker symmetry term at densities below saturation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] )    finally , let us identify the effects of the mean field on the high energy part of the neutron spectra ( @xmath136 ) for the reactions under study .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] and fig.[fig11 ] which show a close up of this region at very forward angles ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "two different scenarios are explored : rbuu calculations with @xmath1 ( thin lines ) are contrasted by rbuu with deactivated mean field ( cascade ) ( thick lines ) .",
    "we observe that at @xmath138 the @xmath1 calculations are practically identical to cascade calculations as the incident energy increases , showing the mean field effects to become negligible . at @xmath139",
    "the @xmath1 calculations give lower values compared to cascade calculations , in good agreement with the data .",
    "however , the @xmath1 calculations underestimate the high energy neutrons ( 70 - 110 mev ) at @xmath140 for p+fe at 1.6 gev and p+pb at 1.2 gev , contrary to cascade calculations .",
    "note that , both calculations resemble each other at @xmath140 for p+pb at 1.6 gev .",
    "thus , it seems that the high energy neutron spectra evaluated by rbuu ( with and without @xmath1 ) have different beam energy dependence compared to the experimental data .",
    "it should be pointed out that our results in the backward direction are nevertheless better with our present rbuu code than with the non - relativistic inc @xcite , qmd @xcite and buu @xcite calculations .",
    "[ fig11 ] shows how the quasi elastic and quasi inelastic peaks are changed due to the mean field . in the cascade calculations ,",
    "the maximum of the calculated quasi - elastic peak is shifted toward a higher energy in comparison to the data .",
    "the shape and yield of the peaks are in better agreement with the cascade calculations at 1600 mev ( and at @xmath8 ) than at 800 and 1200 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "as the mean field calculations are taken into account in rbuu , the maximum outgoing neutron energy is strongly attenuated at incident energy of 1200 mev and 1600 mev . as for the quasi - inelastic peak , i.e. , the peak located at the beam energy minus @xmath141 , the evolution of the shape with the incident energy follows more or less the data for both calculations .",
    "we notice that the @xmath1 calculations have a tendency to become smaller compared to the cascade ones at lower incident energy and need to be improved .    in @xcite",
    "the quasi - elastic and inelastic peaks at 1.2 gev were underestimated by the ultrarelativistic qmd ( urqmd ) calculations , which was attributed to the free angular distributions of the scattered nn - elastic and inelastic collisions adopted in the urqmd model , and it was suggested to introduce medium modified angular distributions ( mmad ) into the urqmd model for reducing the deviation .",
    "we then further test the influence of the mmad on the reactions under study .",
    "we introduce the mmad adopted in @xcite in the collision term of rbuu ( with @xmath1 ) code .",
    "the dot - dashed lines in fig.[fig11 ] illustrate these calculations for p+pb at 800 mev . as one can see , the introduction of mmad in rbuu improves the intensity of both the quasi - elastic and inelastic peaks . for the location , however , the maximum of the calculated quasi - elastic peak is 50 mev downward shift in comparison to the data . at higher incident energy ( not shown here ) , this shift is increased even further to 100 and 150 mev for the reactions under study at 1200 mev and 1600 mev , respectively .",
    "we attribute this failure to the linear energy dependence of the schrodinger equivalent optical potential of the nl - rmf models at high energies @xcite .",
    "indeed , dirac phenomenology on elastic proton - nucleus scattering predicts a nonlinear energy dependence of schrodinger equivalent optical potential for incident energy above 400 mev , which leads to a softening of the optical potential and , consequently , may improve the dynamics of nn - elastic collisions at high energies .",
    "we have studied proton - induced fe and pb reactions at 0.8 , 1.2 and 1.6 gev by a hybrid model , using the rbuu transport approach for the first pre - equilibrium stage and the sm decay model for the second slow stage of the reaction .",
    "the nl - rmf model of the present approach consists of isoscalar ( @xmath142 mesons ) and isovector ( @xmath143 mesons ) parts with different lorentz covariant properties .",
    "the impact of different nl - rmf models ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) on the neutron spectra of the studied reactions has been investigated and the following conclusions can be drawn :    * some effects of the mean fields are found on the high energy part of the neutron spectra , when switching off the mean field and turning to the cascade mode within the rbuu calculations . * the low energy neutron spectrum ( @xmath130 ) is found to be quite sensitive to the details of the relativistic structure of the isovector part of the mean field : the inclusion of the @xmath5-field improves the comparison between theory and experiment to large extent .",
    "the effect is related to the properties ( rate and isospin content ) of the fast nucleon emission during the thermal expansion of the system and so it is sensitive to the low density behaviour of the symmetry term . * the competition between a scalar attractive ( @xmath6 ) and a vector repulsive ( @xmath5 ) fields affects low energy neutrons ( @xmath144 ) only for the more neutron - rich pb target . *",
    "the introduction of medium modified angular distribution in rbuu ( with @xmath1 ) improves the intensity of p+fe and pb reactions at 0.8 gev .",
    "thus , the present comparisons suggest a better agreement with @xmath1 model , however , several other aspects of the mean field dynamics of the rbuu model need further work . for example , the nucleon self - energies of the current version of the model have no momentum dependencies , which might improve the extremity of the calculated spectra at @xmath7 and @xmath17 .",
