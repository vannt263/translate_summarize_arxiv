    "the quantum conductance of a phase coherent conductor can be related , in the diffusive regime , to the transmission probability through the disordered region.@xcite for milikelvin temperatures , when typically the coherence length could become larger than the scattering mean free path , the interference term present in the transmission probability survives disordered averaging , giving rise to quantum corrections to the classical transport properties and novel phenomena .",
    "mesoscopic effects like weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations have been predicted and extensively tested in electronic quantum system for years.@xcite    universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) are sample to sample fluctuations- of the order of the quantum of conductance- originated on the sensitivity of the quantum conductance to changes in an external parameter , like a magnetic flux or a gate voltage.@xcite    the weak localization ( wl ) effect is a quantum correction to the classical conductance , that survives disorder averaging when time reversal symmetry is present.@xcite without spin - orbit effects , it is characterized by a dip in the conductance ( peak in the resistance ) at zero magnetic field . the standard way to detect the wl effect is by its suppression , as its strength falls off with an applied magnetic field . a critical field that scales as @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the diffusion coefficient and @xmath2 the coherence time , washes out the quantum interference term , and thus the wl correction .",

    "@xcite for most of the applications in quantum information theory , only the two lowest energy levels of the fq have been considered in studies of their quantum dynamics.@xcite however , fq exhibits as a function of the static magnetic flux a complex structure of energy levels with multiple avoided crossings .",
    "this rich spectrum can be explored by driving the fq with an ac magnetic flux , for moderate driving frequencies - in the microwave range . in a typical protocol",
    ", the fq is initially prepared in its ground state for a given value of the dc flux , and evolves under the ac driving quasi adiabatically until the first avoided crossing is reached . there",
    ", the state obeys a landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) transition and transforms into a coherent superposition of the ground and excited states.@xcite for weak ac amplitudes , such that a single avoided crossing is reached by the driving protocol , the superposition state and the initial one interfere again at the second passage for the avoided crossing .",
    "hence , the avoided crossing acts as an effective beam splitter , where scattering events take place . for driving periods larger than the coherence time",
    ", the evolved state accumulates a total phase , that depends both on the dc flux and the driving amplitude.@xcite .",
    "the regime of weak driving , when only the lowest two energy levels of the fq are explored and a single avoided crossing is attained by the amplitude of the ac flux , has been studied in extent both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "@xcite in this way , fq have been investigated extensively in recent years as high resolution mach - zhender type of interferometers .",
    "@xcite    for large driving amplitudes ,",
    "when many avoided crossings can be reached , the repeated sweeps through the avoided level crossings result in successive lzs transitions between different energy levels . this driving protocol -named as amplitude spectroscopy ( as )",
    "@xcite- was employed to reconstruct the fq energy level spectrum and to study its dynamics under different conditions .",
    "@xcite the as protocol has been also successfully applied in other systems like charge qubits @xcite , ultracold molecular gases @xcite and single electron spins .",
    "@xcite    the interaction of the driven fq with an external bath has been recently studied to incorporate more realistic dissipative scenarios beyond the pure coherent regime .",
    "relevant and potential useful phenomena like population inversion , @xcite dynamical transition in the interference patterns , @xcite and estimates for coherence times have been extracted from these studies.@xcite    while a priori there is not a direct connection between driven fq and mesoscopic disordered electronic systems , the identification of a transition at the avoided crossing as a scattering event , suggests a route to study mesoscopic - like effects in driven fq . however , for the weak driving regime at most one avoided crossing is reached by the protocol and only two scattering events ( transitions ) take place in one period of the driving .",
    "this poor scattering regime seems insufficient to explore the mesoscopic analogy .",
    "an alternative was proposed in ref . with the implementation of a protocol generated by a biharmonic flux with a phase lag .",
    "the signal was designed to drive the fq up to four times through the avoided crossing in one period , which was chosen much shorter than the energy relaxation time .",
    "therefore , after many periods of the driving the excited state of the fq was populated as a function of time with a characteristic ( equilibration ) rate that was extracted in the experiment by a fitting procedure .    other interesting phenomena of biharmonic drive in flux qubits have been studied in recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works .",
    "the interference conditions can be changed by either tuning the external dc flux or the phase lag in the driving wave form . following this strategy , the equilibration rate @xmath4 and its concomitant fluctuations",
    "have been analyzed in ref . .",
    "for large driving frequencies and for time scales smaller than the relaxation time but larger than the decoherence time , it is possible to study the dynamics of the fq within a model of classical diagonal noise and computing @xmath4 from phenomenological rate equations.@xcite neglecting relaxation , it can be shown that @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the transition rate induced by driving .",
    "@xcite the mesoscopic analogy proposed in ref . was to identify @xmath6 with a transmission rate , which in ( mesoscopic ) electronic transport determines the conductance .",
    "@xcite thus the goal was to access the fluctuations in @xmath6 through the study of the fluctuations in @xmath4 .",
    "this scenario , although tempting , should be taken with caution .",
    "as we already mentioned , the expression @xmath5 is valid for large driving frequencies and for time scales far below relaxation .",
    "@xcite    we solve the full dynamics of the driven fq employing the floquet markov ( fm ) master equation to include relaxation and decoherence processes for a realistic model of a quantum bath.@xcite this formalism @xcite , valid for arbitrary time scales and strength of the driving protocol , allows to compute the decoherence and the relaxation ( equilibration ) rates .",
    "as we will show , both rates result strongly dependent on the driving amplitude and the dc flux , attaining values that might differ up to an order of magnitude from those determined in the absence of driving .",
    "consequently , the relaxation ( equilibration ) rate obtained within the fm formulation might strongly differ from the value @xmath7 - used in ref . to compare with the experimental results- .",
    "an important outcome of our study is related to the weak localization ( wl ) effect , which was not resolved in the experiment of ref .. as we will analize , it is not the driving protocol but the accessible decoherence time which limits the detection of the effect .",

    "@xcite    the wl correction and the ucf tend to wash out as either the effective temperature and/or the coupling with the environment are increased , as expected when decoherence and relaxation processes become more efficient .",
    "this is clearly observed in figs.[f5](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "in addition , the profiles remain almost undisturbed when the product of the effective temperature @xmath138 times the bath coupling @xmath204 remains constant , although each one is varied separately .",
    "this is consistent with the well known result that the dominant contribution to the decoherence rate depends on the product @xmath210 .",
    "@xcite    we want to point out some limitations of the phenomenological approach employed in sec.[stls ] and followed in ref .. on one hand , it disregards relaxation assuming that the equilibration rate @xmath4 is given by @xmath211 . as a consequence the equilibration rates result largely underestimated close to resonances , as we emphasized when describing fig.[f3 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the interpretation of @xmath4 as a conductance is only well justified away from resonances , when is satisfied that @xmath5 .",
    "last but not least , we want to comment on the detection of the wl effect , which has not been measured in ref .. to our view the limitation which precludes the experimental observation of the wl - like effect is not the driving protocol , as the authors of ref . suggested , but mainly the difficulty in capturing the extremely sharp resonant conditions as the flux detuning is swept , and also the relatively short experimental decoherence times @xmath212 . from the theory of disordered electronic systems",
    "it is known that the size of the weak localization correction scales ( logarithmically ) with the dephasing time @xmath213.@xcite    consistent with this result , fig.[f5](a ) shows very well defined dips in @xmath214 at @xmath215 , for values of the coupling @xmath216 and temperature of 20 mk - as the reported experimentally .",
    "these values give decoherence rates @xmath217 mhz ( @xmath218ns ) .",
    "thus it is expected that for slightly larger values of @xmath212- but not so far from the reported @xmath219 , it could be possible to experimentally access to the full wl dip , once the resonance conditions can be explored .     and @xmath220 ( panel ( a ) ) and normalized standard deviations @xmath221 and @xmath222 ( panel ( b ) ) averaged from @xmath223 to @xmath224 as a function of the time reversal broken parameter @xmath73 .",
    "the different values of the dephasing rate @xmath101 used to compute @xmath225 and the values of the temperature @xmath138 and bath coupling constant @xmath204 employed to compute the rates @xmath8 within the fm formalism , are respectively specified in the inset .",
    "fq parameters are @xmath111 mhz , @xmath112 mhz , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . ]",
    "in this work we have tested fluctuation effects associated to broken time reversal symmetry in fq driven by a biharmonic ( dc + ac ) magnetic flux with a phase lag .    employing the full floquet markov master equation we have computed relaxation @xmath186 and decoherence @xmath165 rates , both resulting strongly dependent on the phase lag and the dc flux detuning , exhibiting appreciable fluctuations . as a function of the dc flux and away from the resonance conditions with the driving field , @xmath226 and @xmath227 with @xmath228 , _",
    "i.e. _ in agreement with the relaxation and decoherence rates predicted for the undriven fq .",
    "however , close to resonances both rates show large variations compared to the respective values out of resonances , even satisfying @xmath229 .",
    "the relaxation ( equilibration ) rate @xmath186 can be accessed experimentally by measuring the decay of the fq excited state population .",
    "recently the fluctuations in the measured equilibration rate have been analized and associated to universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) , following an analogy to well known phenomena exhibited in disordered mesoscopic electronic systems .",
    "@xcite however , as we discuss in extent along this work , the _ mesoscopic analogy _ is only well justified for the out of resonance regime , when the equilibration rate can be described in terms of a transition probability induced by the driving protocol .",
    "besides ucf , we also predict that the weak localization effect can be detected for the biharmonic driving protocol .",
    "however to observe this effect , the experiments should be performed in a more coherent regime , in which larger values of @xmath212 could be attained . nowadays the control on the environmental bath degrees of freedom is a promising way to enlarge coherence , as have been recently proposed and tested .",
    "@xcite    by increasing the driving amplitude , more avoided crossings of the fq can be reached , enabling the computation of averages and fluctuations beyond the weak scattering limit- which in fact is a limitation of the present approach to the mesoscopic analogy .",
    "this regime is experimentally attainable as the amplitude spectroscopy experiments @xcite have proven .",
