    "joint models are becoming increasingly popular as they allow an analysis of the association between the risk of an event and the change over time of a longitudinal marker @xcite . in a cognitive ageing study ,",
    "the link between cognitive decline and dementia needs to be understood to better describe the course of the disease in the pre - diagnostic stage , and to develop prediction tools for the risk of dementia .",
    "moreover , modeling the evolution of cognitive markers without modeling jointly the risk of dementia may lead to biased estimations of the change over time of the marker as collection of cognitive measures is often stopped after dementia onset , inducing non - random missing data .",
    "joint models correct for this bias by accounting for the association between the marker and the time - to - event .",
    "+ @xcite proposed shared random effects models where a function of the random effects from the longitudinal model is included in the survival model , thus capturing the correlation between the time - to - event and the marker .",
    "the risk of the event is then partly explained by the individual dynamics of the marker trajectory .",
    "an alternative is the joint latent class mixed model , developed by @xcite which considers a heterogeneous population , divisible into several homogeneous latent subgroups , with a specific risk of the event and a specific evolution of the marker .",
    "a significant computational advantage is the replacement of the integrals on the random effects by a sum over the classes , such that the likelihood of this model has a closed form .",
    "+ when studying the risk factors or natural history of alzheimer s disease , the most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly , it is important to account for the competing risk of death as dementia and death have common risk factors . @xcite and @xcite proposed a shared random effects model accounting for competing risks and @xcite developed a joint latent class model for competing risks to study multiple longitudinal markers of different natures .",
    "however , studies of the risk of dementia are made more difficult by the interval censoring of time - to - dementia .",
    "indeed , in cohort studies , patients are observed intermittently and the age at dementia onset is not precisely known as dementia can only be diagnosed at clinical follow - up visits . as such , there is an interval of uncertainty between the last visit where the patient has been seen to be healthy and the visit where a diagnosis was made .",
    "more importantly , a patient can become demented and die between two visits without being diagnosed as demented .",
    "consequently , the risk of dementia may be underestimated when interval censoring is not accounted for , for example when considering only the first observed event in the standard competing risks model .",
    "@xcite proposed an illness - death model to fix this issue but this has not yet been implemented in a joint model . death and dementia are semi - competing events since dementia can not occur after death but death occurs after dementia .",
    "+ to our knowledge , only one joint model combining a multi - state model and a mixed model for a longitudinal marker has previously been proposed . within the framework of the shared random effects approach , dantan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) described a joint model combining a two - phase mixed model with a random change - point and a multi - state model .",
    "the underlying clinical idea was an acceleration of the cognitive decline before dementia onset , which was modelled by a second phase with a different slope in the mixed model . in this model ,",
    "interval censoring was not a critical issue as death depended on the current value of the marker and not on the current state .",
    "+ in this work , we propose a joint latent class illness - death model for semi - competing interval - censored events and a longitudinal marker .",
    "we propose two versions of the model , a markovian and a semi - markovian version , and an extension for the joint analysis of multiple longitudinal markers . in the following section",
    ", we detail the model and the estimation procedure . in section 3 , we present a simulation study to evaluate the estimation procedure and compare the proposed approach with a joint latent class model for competing risks that does not take into account interval censoring . in section 4 , the model is applied to study cognitive decline before alzheimer s disease diagnosis and death using data from the french paquid cohort , including 3,777 subjects followed over 20 years with regular cognitive evaluation .",

    "we denote by @xmath5 the age at dementia onset and @xmath6 the age at death .",
    "we assume that age at dementia onset is interval - censored while age at death is only right - censored as generally , exact ages of death are collected in cohort studies .",

    "the model relies on the hypothesis that the population is heterogeneous and can be divided into g homogeneous latent classes .",

    "we proposed a joint latent class illness - death model for semi - competing interval - censored events and longitudinal data .",
    "joint models have previously been developed to capture the correlation between a longitudinal marker and competing risks but no previous model has accounted for interval censoring @xcite .",
    "our simulations highlighted biased estimates of the joint model for standard competing risks . by dealing with interval censoring ,",
    "the proposed method corrects for this bias and highlights different profiles of cognitive decline associated with different transition intensities of death and dementia .",
    "subsequently , the mean trajectories of cognitive decline for people who were demented or deceased at a given age can be estimated .",
    "this makes it possible to distinguish the cognitive decline of the healthy elderly from the cognitive decline before death without dementia and the cognitive decline in the pre - dementia phase that appears to be the steepest .",
    "+ we chose a latent class approach to account for the heterogeneity of cognitive aging .",
    "it could be also interesting to develop a joint model for semi - competing interval - censored events and longitudinal data in a shared random effects framework .",
    "nevertheless , with some realistic assumptions , handling of interval censoring is not as critical in shared random effects models because the transition intensity of death may depend on the current value of the marker and possibly on the current slope .",
    "thus , conditionally on the current value and the slope of the marker ( which is the cognitive test in our application ) , it may be sensible to assume that the transition intensity of death is identical for demented and healthy subjects . in this case , as shown in dantan et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , it is not necessary to distinguish possible individual trajectories between the last visit without dementia and the end of follow - up or death .",
    "the likelihood for interval - censored data is identical to the one without interval censoring , as long as we impute the middle of the censoring interval for subjects diagnosed as demented .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that the uncertainty regarding time to dementia onset , among the subjects diagnosed as demented , is not a major issue as long as the intervals between visits are short enough . nevertheless ,",
    "extending the joint shared random effects model to include an illness - death submodel instead of a standard times - to - events model could be useful to study the association between marker evolution and transition intensity of death among diseased subjects . +",
    "a score test was previously developed @xcite to assess the assumption of independence between the marker and the time to an event conditionally on the latent classes .",
    "this score was extended to the framework of competing risks and multiple markers by @xcite . in the future ,",
    "an extension to joint illness - death model accounting for interval censoring could be useful .",
