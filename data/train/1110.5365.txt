    "we extend woodin s result into the realm of partially supercompact cardinals . since @xmath1 is measurable if and only if @xmath1 is @xmath1-supercompact , one immediately sees several natural ways of doing this .",

    "above , the term `` equiconsistent '' is intended to mean that , in the forward direction the same cardinal witnessing the hypothesis also witnesses the conclusion ; and in the reverse direction , the same cardinal witnessing the hypothesis witnesses the conclusion in a forcing extension .",
    "the details of cardinal preservation in the various forcing extensions in parts ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) of the main theorem will be worked out below .",
    "questions ( 1 ) - ( 4 ) above can be seen as a special case to a more general question :    1 .",
    "what kind of @xmath2 patterns are consistent with a @xmath0-supercompact cardinal from what type of large cardinal assumption ?",
    "there are some obvious resrtictions such as if @xmath2 fails at @xmath1 , a @xmath0-supercompact cardinal , then it must fail unboundedly often below @xmath1 . also , if @xmath0 is a strong limit and @xmath2 holds below and at @xmath1 then @xmath2 must hold up to @xmath0 .",
    "there are however some subtle issues in answering the general question which we will address in a forthcoming paper .",
    "let us note that friedman and thompson have an alternate approach to proving woodin s result .",
    "indeed they show in @xcite that from the hypothesis of the existence of a @xmath14-hypermeasurable cardinal @xmath1 , which is equiconsistent with the existence of a cardinal @xmath1 that is @xmath5-tall , after doing a preparatory forcing iteration one may use side - by - side sacks forcing to pump up the size of the power set of @xmath1 to @xmath5 while preserving the measurability of @xmath1 using what they refer to as the tuning fork method .",
    "the way we will establish math theorem ( 2)-(4 ) in this paper is by forcing that achieves @xmath15 , and hence @xmath16 , and preserves the @xmath0-supercompactness of @xmath1 , where @xmath12 is a cardinal .",
    "this suggests the question , can one force a violation of @xmath2 at @xmath0 while preserving @xmath2 in the interval @xmath17 and preserving the @xmath0-supercompactness of @xmath1 ?",
    "it seems as though the method of surgical modification of a generic , due to woodin , does not generalize to answer this question .",
    "however , friedman and honsik show in their forthcoming paper @xcite that the answer to this question is yes by using generalized sacks forcing .",
    "we also note that question ( 5 ) above is part of a larger program of attempting to describe what kind of easton functions can be realized as the continuum function by forcing while preserving large cardinals . for more on this",
    "see @xcite .",
    "here we provide an outline of the rest of the paper . in section [ sectionterminology ]",
    "we discuss some notational conventions . in section [ sectionpreliminaries ] we state some basic lemmas about lifting large cardinal embeddings that will be used throughout the paper .",
