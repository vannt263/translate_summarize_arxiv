    "the study of neutron stars is attractive in part because of the fundamental issues of physics that can be addressed .",
    "these include the behavior of spacetime in strong gravity , the equation of state of matter at supranuclear densities , and the propagation of thermonuclear burning in degenerate matter , an issue which has relevance to many astrophysical events including classical novae and type  ia supernovae .    the discovery with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) of highly coherent brightness oscillations during type i ( thermonuclear ) x - ray bursts from six low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) ( for reviews see , e.g. , strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997b ; smith , morgan & bradt 1997 ; zhang et al.1996 ; and strohmayer et al .",
    "1997c ) has provided a potentially sensitive new tool to understand these fundamental issues .",
    "the burst oscillations are thought to be produced by spin modulation of one or two localized thermonuclear hot spots that are brighter than the surrounding surface .",
    "the existence of the oscillations , as well as some of the reported behavior of their amplitudes ( see , e.g. , strohmayer et al .",
    "1997b ) seems to confirm the pre - existing theoretical expectation that x - ray bursts on neutron stars are caused by ignition at a point followed by thermonuclear propagation around the surface ( e.g. , fryxell & woosley 1982 ; nozakura et al .",
    "1984 ; bildsten 1995 ) .",
    "the observed waveforms of these oscillations , and their dependence on time and photon energy , can in principle be used to constrain the mass and radius of the star and the velocity and type of thermonuclear propagation .",
    "such information can only be extracted by detailed comparison of theoretical waveforms with the data .    here",
    "we conduct the most complete existing survey of the properties of the light curves and resultant oscillation amplitudes for one or two expanding hot spots .",
    "we calculate light curves and oscillation amplitudes as a function of stellar compactness , rotational velocity at the stellar surface , spot size and location , orientation of the line of sight , angular dependence of the specific intensity , and spot asymmetries .",
    "our calculations follow a procedure similar to that of pechenick , ftaclas , & cohen ( 1983 ) , strohmayer ( 1992 ) , and miller & lamb ( 1998 ) , but our survey is more comprehensive than these previous treatments in that we fully investigate the effects of an expanding spot size on the light curves and oscillation amplitudes , while also exploring the effects of gravity , stellar rotation , viewing geometries , and anisotropic emission .",
    "in addition , we present the first calculations of the effects of having two non - antipodal spots as well as the effects of asymmetries in spot brightness .    in ",
    "2 we describe our assumptions and the calculational method . in   3 we present our results .",
    "we show that for small spot sizes the oscillation amplitude has only a weak dependence on spot size , but that as the spot grows the dependence becomes very strong .",
    "we also show that stellar rotation , beaming functions and spot asymmetries all tend to increase the observed oscillation amplitudes whereas greater compactness and larger spot sizes tend to decrease the amplitudes . in   4 we exhibit applications of these results to data on the amplitudes of two harmonics in 4u  1636536 and on",
    "the phase lags versus energy for sax  j18083658 .",
    "we discuss our results and present our conclusions in   5 .",
    "we make the following assumptions in our calculations :    1 .",
    "_ the observed radiation comes from one or two emitting spots on the surface . _",
    "the sources with strong bursts tend to have persistent accretion rates a factor of @xmath110100 less than the eddington critical luminosity @xmath2 at which the radial radiation force balances gravity , whereas the peak luminosity of the bursts is typically close to @xmath2 .",
    "the flux from the burning regions therefore greatly exceeds the flux from the quiescent regions , so for much of the burst this is a plausible approximation .",
    "the radiation is homogeneous and emitted isotropically unless noted otherwise .",
    "_ this assumption is made for simplicity , as presently there is no physical evidence that suggests whether or not the photon emission from the hot spots is isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "_ if there are two spots , they are identical and both grow at the same velocity unless noted otherwise .",
    "_ this assumption is also made for simplicity .",
    "although the geometry of the two magnetic poles is unlikely to be identical , not enough is known about their structure to realistically model non - identical spots .",
    "the exterior spacetime of the neutron star is the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "_ we neglect the effect of frame dragging due to stellar rotation because it only generates small second order effects for the rotation rates of interest ( see lamb & miller 1995 and miller & lamb 1996 ) .",
    "we compute the waveform of the oscillation as seen at infinity using the procedure of pechenick et al .",
    "figure  [ coords ] shows our coordinate system and angle definitions .",
    "the photons emitted from the star travel along null geodesics which , for a schwarzschild geometry , satisfy the equation ( misner , thorne , and wheeler 1973 , p. 673 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are spherical coordinates , @xmath6 is the gravitational mass of the star , and @xmath7 is the impact parameter of the photon orbit . in both the above equation and throughout , we use geometrized units in which @xmath8 .",
    "if the photon is initially at a global azimuthal angle @xmath9 , then the global azimuthal angle at infinity follows from equation ( 1 ) and is ( pechenick et al .",
    "1983 , eq .",
    "[ 2.12 ] ) @xmath10^{-1/2 } \\,du\\ ] ] where @xmath11 .",
    "note that not all of this angle is due to light deflection : for example , a photon emitted tangent to the radial vector in flat spacetime will have an angle @xmath12 at infinity .",
    "the maximum angle occurs when @xmath13 and is given by ( pechenick et al .",
    "1983 , eq .",
    "[ 2.13 ] ) @xmath14^{-1/2 } \\,du\\ ] ] the observer at infinity can not see the spot if the observer s azimuthal angle exceeds @xmath15 .",
    "for each phase of rotation we compute the projected area of many small elements of a given finite size spot .",
    "we then build up the light curve of the entire spot by superposing the light curve of all the small elements .",
    "we chose a grid resolution such that the effect of having a finite number of small elements produces a fractional error @xmath16 in the computed oscillation amplitudes .",
    "for isotropic emission the intensity of radiation at a given rotational phase as seen by an observer at infinity is directly proportional to the projected area of the spot . to investigate the effect of anisotropic emission",
    "we include a flux distribution function in the intensity , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the angle between the surface normal and the photon propagation direction .",
    "the intensity is then proportional to the product of the projected area of the spot ( which is proportional to @xmath19 ) and @xmath17 .",
    "we consider two types of anisotropic emission : cosine (  pencil \" ) beaming , in which @xmath20 , and sine (  fan \" ) beaming , in which @xmath21 .",
    "the intensity distribution of an emitting spot is aberrated by the rotation of the star , and the photon frequency is doppler shifted by the factor @xmath22 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath23 is the velocity at the stellar equator , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the angle between the direction of photon propagation and the local direction of rotation .",
    "the inferred spin frequencies of these neutron stars are @xmath1300  hz , implying surface velocities @xmath26c for stellar radii @xmath27  km .",
    "after computing the oscillation waveform using the above approach , we fourier - analyze the resulting light curve to determine the oscillation amplitudes and phases as a function of photon energy at different harmonics .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the basic quantities of interest include the mass and radius of the neutron stars in bursting sources and the nature and speed of thermonuclear propagation on the stellar surface .",
    "we therefore need to relate these fundamental quantities to the observables , such as the oscillation waveform as a function of time and photon energy .",
    "we do this by computing theoretical waveforms using different assumptions about the compactness of the star , the angular size of the burning region , the angular location of the observer and magnetic pole relative to the stellar rotation axis , the surface rotation velocity of the star , and the angular distribution of the specific intensity at the surface . in this section",
    "we consider each of these effects separately , to isolate the effect they have on the waveform and facilitate interpretation of the data . here",
    "we always quote the fractional rms amplitude of brightness oscillations .",
    "we also quote only bolometric amplitudes in this section ; as shown by miller & lamb ( 1998 ) , oscillations in the energy spectrum of the source may yield substantially higher amplitudes in the countrate spectrum measured by bandpass - limited instruments such as _ rxte_.      the decrease in oscillation amplitude as the bursts in some sources progress ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1997b ) may suggest an initially localized emission spot that expands via relatively slow ( @xmath28 cm  s@xmath29 ) thermonuclear propagation .",
    "if so , we would expect that the waveforms from burst oscillations would reflect a variety of spot sizes .",
    "we therefore consider spots that range from pointlike to those with an angular radius of 180@xmath30 .",
    "also , physical conditions existing in the region of emitting spots may alter photon emission as in the case of some radio pulsars .",
    "accordingly , we consider the effects of including cosine and sine beaming functions in the calculations of the waveforms .",
    "figure  [ waveforms ] shows the waveforms from a single emitting spot ( left - hand column ) and two emitting spots ( right - hand column ) for various spot sizes .",
    "as expected , the amplitude of the intensity oscillations decreases as the spot size increases .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a single emitting spot there is a critical spot size ( @xmath31 for the case of @xmath32 ) at which the spot is never completely out of view and hence the intensity remains greater than zero for the entire rotational phase .",
    "as the waveforms illustrate , the cosine beaming function , which enhances emission along the magnetic field axis , tends to narrow the width of the waveform peaks .",
    "the sine beaming function enhances emission near the tangential plane and will produce a four peaked waveform for the case of a small single emitting spot ( see pechenick et al . 1983 ) .",
    "we are also interested in the effect of the compactness of the star on the observed amplitudes .",
    "figure  [ ampvssize]a shows the fractional rms amplitudes at the first two harmonics as a function of spot size and stellar compactness for one emitting spot centered at @xmath33 ( i.e. , for an observer and spot both in the rotational equator ) .",
    "the curves for the first harmonic illustrates the general shape of most of the first harmonic curves .",
    "initially , the amplitude depends only weakly on spot size .",
    "however , once the spot grows to @xmath34 there is a steep decline in the oscillation amplitude which flattens out only near the tail of the expansion .",
    "figure  [ ampvssize]b shows the fractional rms amplitude at the second harmonic under the same assumptions but for two identical , antipodal emitting spots .",
    "the range in spot size here is @xmath35 since two antipodal spots of @xmath36 radii cover the entire stellar surface .",
    "note that in this situation , there is no first harmonic .",
    "these curves illustrate two interesting features of the two spot configuration .",
    "first , the strength of the strongest oscillation amplitude in the two spot case is @xmath37 weaker than the strength of the strongest oscillation amplitude in the one spot case considered above .",
    "furthermore , the curve of the second harmonic does not exhibit the same sharp falloff seen in the first harmonic curve .",
    "thus , the detection of a particularly large fractional rms amplitude with a steep amplitude decline can verify that what is being observed is a first harmonic ( i.e. , power generated at the stellar spin frequency ) rather than any higher harmonics ( see miller & lamb 1998 ) .",
    "the second interesting feature is that the curve of the second harmonic in figure  [ ampvssize]b is nearly identical in both magnitude and shape to the first @xmath36 of the curve of the second harmonic for the case of one spot shown in figure  [ ampvssize]a .",
    "thus , for this geometry , the introduction of a second emitting spot antipodal to the first tends to destroy the first harmonic while leaving the second harmonic unaffected .",
    "this result obtains whenever : ( 1 ) the physical assumptions ( e.g. , compactness , rotational velocity , flux distribution function ) made for both the one and two spot configurations are the same , and ( 2 ) the viewing geometry for both configurations is @xmath38 .    in this figure",
    "we also display the effect gravity has on the oscillation amplitudes . from equation ( 3 ) we know that more compact stars have a larger @xmath39 , and hence a larger fraction of their surface is visible to observers . as a result , oscillation amplitudes for more compact neutron stars are smaller .",
    "an exception occurs at the second harmonic of very compact stars ( @xmath40 ) , in which case gravitational light deflection focuses the emitted radiation enough to raise the oscillation amplitude ( see pechenick et al .",
    "1983 and miller & lamb 1998 ) .",
    "note that the stellar compactness affects the amplitude at the second harmonic far more than the amplitude at the first harmonic .",
    "figure  [ ampvsang]a shows the oscillation amplitude as a function of @xmath41 ( i.e. , for the observer and the center of the spot at the same rotational latitude ) for a single emitting spot with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as @xmath44 increases , the width of the peaks in the light curve decrease ( see pechenick et al .",
    "1983 ) and hence the oscillation amplitudes increase .",
    "the interesting feature here is that the second harmonic has a significant amplitude only for @xmath45 . since 50% of the time @xmath44",
    "will be between @xmath46 and @xmath36 ( assuming randomly distributed observers ) , only half of all observers will detect a second harmonic during a typical burst involving one spot . in figure",
    "[ ampvsang]b we make the same assumptions as in figure  [ ampvsang]a but for two emitting spots rather than one .",
    "if we had assumed flat space - time and an infinitesimal spot size then the second emitting spot would become visible only for @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath48 only one spot would be observable .",
    "for @xmath43 , @xmath49 , and therefore a second , infinitesimal , spot would begin to be visible at @xmath50 . since in figure  [ ampvsang ] ,",
    "the calculation was done with @xmath42 , the spot begins to become visible at @xmath51 , explaining the appearance of the second harmonic at this @xmath44 value .",
    "note that in the two spot case the first harmonic generates significant power for a wide range of @xmath44 .",
    "this occurs because for @xmath52 one spot is more directly aligned with the observer s line of sight , and as a result the intensity maxima of the two spots are unequal . in general , whenever an asymmetry exists between the two emitting spots such that the intensity maxima of the two spots are unequal , power is generated at the first harmonic .      in figure  [ ampvsvel ]",
    "we include the effects of doppler shifts and aberrations on the oscillation amplitudes .",
    "we assume a surface rotation velocity of @xmath53c , which corresponds to a neutron star with radius @xmath54  km and spin frequency @xmath55  hz . as can be seen , the amplitude of the second harmonic is increased significantly more than the amplitude of the first harmonic as a result of rotation .",
    "the tendency to generate more power at the higher harmonics than at the spin frequency is a general property of the rotation ( see miller & lamb 1998 for a discussion of this effect ) .",
    "physical conditions in the region of emitting spots might cause anisotropic emission of radiation .",
    "the results of including a cosine beaming function and a sine beaming function for the case of one spot are shown in figure  [ ampvsbeam]a and for two antipodal spots in figure  [ ampvsbeam]b .",
    "as is apparent from figure  [ waveforms ] , the enhanced emission along the magnetic axis for the cosine beaming tends to narrow peaks in the light curves ( see pechenick et al .",
    "1983 for a discussion of the light curves for beamed emission ) and hence raise the oscillation amplitudes .",
    "for the sine beaming the peaks in the light curve are broadened , tending to lower the amplitude at the first harmonic .",
    "both beaming functions do , however , generate substantial additional power at the higher harmonics .",
    "recent work by miller ( 1999 ) gives evidence for the presence of power at the stellar spin frequency for a source ( 4u  1636536 ) consisting of two emitting spots .",
    "earlier we saw that one possible mechanism for generating significant power at the stellar spin frequency for the case of two emitting spots is to vary the viewing geometry .",
    "another possible mechanism is to have the spots be non - antipodal .",
    "this can occur , for instance , if the star s dipolar magnetic field has its axis slightly displaced from its center . in the left panel of figure  [ asymmetric ]",
    "we show the oscillation amplitude as a function of spot separation for the case of two emitting spots with @xmath56 , @xmath33 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the spots are perfectly antipodal at a spot separation of @xmath57 .",
    "as the figure shows , the oscillation amplitude at the second harmonic is relatively constant while the oscillation amplitude at the first harmonic is a linear function of spot separation . at a spot separation of @xmath58 the fractional rms amplitudes of the first and second harmonic",
    "are equal .",
    "another way to produce power at the spin frequency is to have differences in brightness between the two spots .",
    "such an asymmetry can occur , for example , if the strength of the magnetic field at the location of the two spots is different , thereby pooling different amounts of nuclear fuel onto the hot spot regions . in the right panel of figure  [ asymmetric ]",
    "we show the oscillation amplitude as a function of the percent difference between the brightness of the two spots . as in the case of the non - antipodal spots ,",
    "the amplitude at the second harmonic is essentially constant while the amplitude at the first harmonic increases linearly with increasing percent difference in spot brightness .",
    "these figures reinforce the conclusion , also evident from figure  [ ampvssize ] , that only with two spots can the oscillation at the first overtone be stronger than the oscillation at the fundamental .",
    "therefore , within the general theoretical model explored in this paper , 4u  1636536 has two nearly antipodal hot spots .",
    "_ doppler model of phase lags._the hard x - ray spectrum of low - mass x - ray binaries is well - fit by a comptonization model , in which the central neutron star is surrounded by a hot corona of electrons and the photons injected into this corona are relatively soft .",
    "it was therefore expected that the observed hard photons , having scattered more often than the soft photons and thus having a longer path length before escape , would lag the soft photons . instead , in several sources a hard _ lead _",
    "was discovered .",
    "one explanation for this lead was suggested by ford ( 1999 ) .",
    "he proposed that doppler shifting of photons emitted from rotating hot spots , as in thermonuclear burst oscillations , would tend to produce a hard lead because the approaching edge of the spot would precede the trailing edge .",
    "he compared a simplified calculation of this effect with burst data for aql  x-1 and showed that an adequate fit could be obtained ( ford 1999 ) .",
    "the millisecond x - ray pulsar sax  j18083658 provides a stronger test of this hypothesis .",
    "this source has strong oscillations ( @xmath15% rms ) at @xmath1401  hz , which as usual are attributed to rotational modulation of a hot spot on the surface .",
    "cui , morgan , & titarchuk ( 1998 ) obtained precise measurements of the oscillation phase as a function of energy , and found that in this source as well there is a hard lead .",
    "figure  [ lagfigs ] shows sample calculations of the time lag as a function of energy . in the left panel",
    "we focus on the dependence of the lag on mass , and in the right panel we concentrate on the effect of changing the surface temperature . in both cases",
    "the surface emission pattern is the pattern for a gray atmosphere , and we assume @xmath59 and a stellar spin frequency of 401  hz , which is the spin frequency of sax  j18083658 . in panel  ( a ) we assume a surface effective temperature of @xmath60  kev as measured at infinity . in panel",
    "( b ) we assume a stellar gravitational mass of 1.6  @xmath61 , which gives a surface equatorial rotation velocity of 0.1  c as measured at infinity . from this figure",
    "it is clear that the effect of increasing the mass is to increase the phase lead , whereas the effect of increasing the temperature is to increase the energy at which the curve starts to flatten .",
    "_ comparison with data._comparing these models with the data for sax  j18083658 introduces additional complications . in order to improve statistics , cui et al .",
    "( 1998 ) averaged the phase lags over the period from 11 april 1998 to 29 april 1998 .",
    "the calculation of the phase leads by cui et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also involves averaging the phase over energy bins several kev in width .",
    "examination of figure  [ 1808data ] shows that the phase changes rapidly over such an energy range , implying that the measured phase lead depends sensitively on the input spectrum .",
    "the effective area of rxte also decreases rapidly below 4  kev , which strongly affects the observed average phase in the 23  kev reference bin .",
    "finally , given that the observed spectrum is not a blackbody , but is instead approximately a power law of index 1.86 from @xmath13  kev to @xmath130  kev ( heindl & smith 1998 ) , compton reprocessing has taken place and the observed phase lags are the result of a convolution between the unscattered phase lags and the compton redistribution function .",
    "figure  [ 1808data ] plots the data along with a simplified model of the phase lags taking some of these complications into account .",
    "we ignore the changing effective area of rxte and assume a constant response with energy . based on the power - law nature of the spectrum , we approximate the process of comptonization by assuming that the energy of the injected photons is much less than the observed photon energies or the temperature of the electrons .",
    "we also assume an isothermal atmosphere , in contrast to the gray atmosphere we used for figure  [ lagfigs ] , which gives too low a hard lead .",
    "the best fit has @xmath62  kev as observed at infinity , @xmath63  km , and @xmath64 .",
    "the total @xmath65 of the fit is 38.6 for 6 degrees of freedom .",
    "the dominant contribution to this @xmath65 comes from the underprediction of the hard lead at low energies .",
    "this is as expected , because we assumed an instrumental effective area that is constant with energy , whereas in reality the effective area rises rapidly with increasing photon energy at low energies .",
    "this changing effective area gives greater weight to the larger leads at higher energies , which is in better agreement with the data .",
    "therefore , given the simplifications of the model , our fit to the data is encouragingly good and supports the doppler interpretation of the observed hard lead .",
    "_ relative amplitudes of harmonics._we have presented calculations of the waveforms and amplitudes at different harmonics of the spin frequency for one or two hot spots and many realistic combinations of stellar compactness , spot size and emission pattern , observation angle , and magnetic inclination .",
    "these calculations show that typically either the fundamental or the first overtone has an amplitude much larger than the amplitude of any other harmonic .",
    "this corresponds well to the observations of the six sources with burst brightness oscillations , in which there is a strong oscillation at only one frequency .",
    "we also find that if the first overtone is the dominant harmonic , there must be two similar and nearly antipodal bright spots , because a single spot always produces a much stronger oscillation at the fundamental than at any overtone .",
    "in contrast , if the fundamental is much stronger than the overtone , this is consistent with but does not require a single spot : if there are two bright spots that are sufficiently dissimilar or far away from antipodal , or if our line of sight is such that one of the spots is hidden , then the oscillation at the fundamental will dominate .",
    "this implies that the three sources with detectable oscillations near @xmath1300  hz ( 4u  172834 [ strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ] , 4u  170243 [ markwardt , strohmayer , & swank 1999 ] , and 4u  1636536 [ miller 1999 ; this source has a strong oscillation at @xmath1580  hz but a detectable oscillation at @xmath1290  hz ] ) have spin frequencies of @xmath1300  hz , whereas the three sources with detectable oscillations only at @xmath1500600  hz ( aql  x-1 [ zhang et al .",
    "1998 ] , mxb  174329 [ strohmayer et al .",
    "1997a ] , and ks  1731260 [ smith et al .  1997",
    "] ) could have spin frequencies at either this frequency or half of it .",
    "therefore , all six burst oscillation sources are consistent with having spin frequencies @xmath1300  hz .    _ information content of waveforms._our results also show clearly that power density spectra , which contain information only on the relative amplitudes of different harmonics , are much less informative than the waveforms themselves .",
    "figure  [ fixedratio ] shows three different waveforms that all have an amplitude at the first overtone that is 2.3 times the amplitude at the fundamental , which is the ratio found by miller ( 1999 ) for 4u  1636536 .",
    "in all three cases there are two bright spots .",
    "the solid line shows the waveform for two identical pointlike spots that are 175@xmath66 apart , the dotted line shows the waveform for two antipodal spots with brightnesses differing by 10% , and the dashed line shows the waveform for two identical and antipodal spots that are 75@xmath66 from the rotational pole and observed from a line of sight that is also 75@xmath66 from the rotational pole .",
    "although the amplitude ratio is the same in each case , the waveforms are quite different from each other , and the physical implications are also different .",
    "this underscores the importance of calculating waveforms and not just power density spectra , both observationally and theoretically .    _",
    "searches for weak higher harmonics._the amplitudes and phases of higher harmonics potentially contain important clues about the propagation of nuclear burning and about the compactness of the star , but as yet there are no sources in which a higher harmonic of a strong oscillation has been observed .",
    "our plots of amplitude versus spot size suggest that it is best to look for weaker higher harmonics when the dominant oscillation is strong .",
    "the reason is that , in general , the ratio of the second to first harmonic drops with increasing spot size , and therefore with decreasing amplitude at the fundamental .",
    "hence , a search only of data showing strong oscillations may more sensitively reveal the presence of higher harmonics .",
    "_ shape of amplitude decrease as a function of spot size._in our calculations , as the spot size increases the amplitude decreases slowly until the angular radius of the spot is @xmath67 but quickly thereafter .",
    "this apparently conflicts with the observations of 4u  172834 reported in strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , in which the error bars are large but it appears that the decrease in amplitude is fast from the start and then slows down .",
    "further quantification of this result is important , but if confirmed it could be caused by a number of effects .",
    "for example , the spot size might never be small : if ignition were nearly simultaneous over a large area , further spreading would already be in the large - spot regime , and hence the amplitude would decrease quickly . if the spreading velocity were initially high but then decreased , this would have a similar effect on the amplitudes . alternately ,",
    "if there is a corona with a non - negligible scattering optical depth around the star and the optical depth increases as the burst approaches its peak flux , this would also decrease the amplitude faster than expected when the optical depth is zero .",
    "_ phase lags as a probe of surface rotation velocity._we find that the hard lead observed in sax  j18083658 is fit reasonably well by a model ( see ford 1999 ) in which rotational doppler shifts cause higher - energy x - rays to lead lower - energy x - rays .",
    "this fit lends support to the model , and suggests that with better fitting and more data ( especially from a future high - area timing mission ) it may be possible to use phase lag versus energy data to help constraint the mass @xmath6 or the compactness @xmath68 of the star ."
