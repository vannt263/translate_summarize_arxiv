    "liquid crystal displays ( lcds ) take a very important position in modern information technology ( it ) .",
    "they are economical both in their consumption of energy and their request of space .",
    "recent developments including optical compensation and in - plane switching ( ips )  @xcite technology improve the quality of high - end lcds applied in monitors . while these techniques are too expensive for the production of cheap , low - end displays , simpler solutions for one of the main problems are required : the contrast of conventional displays based on the twisted nematic ( tn ) cell  @xcite strongly depends on the viewing angle .",
    "the multidomain cell ( see  @xcite and references cited in these articles ) is a very simple approach to reduce this deficiency .    in the classical tn cell",
    "the liquid crystal molecules at the two confining glass plates are anchored parallel to the surface .",
    "they enclose an angle of @xmath0 so that the molecules in the bulk form a helix . by slightly tilting the molecules at the surface , the twisting sense of the helix",
    "can unambiguously be chosen left or right . in the standard tn cell , the molecules in the bulk are always completely aligned along the electric field by applying a sufficiently high voltage . in a tn greyscale display ,",
    "different grey values are achieved by varying the applied voltage .",
    "the molecules are not fully aligned along the electric field .",
    "their direction is governed by an equilibrium between elastic and electric torques .",
    "the helical structure is still partly recognizable .",
    "since all the helices have the same twisting sense , the inversion symmetry of the tn cell is broken . as a result",
    "the contrast strongly depends on the viewing angle .",
    "the basic idea of the multi - domain ( md ) concept is to avoid this symmetry breaking .",
    "the two surfaces of the cell are treated such that alternating domains of left- and right - handed helices occur like on a chessboard  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the optical effects of the different domains compensate each other at the length scale of the display pixel , and hence the dependence of the contrast on the viewing angle is strongly reduced .",
    "different surface treatments are employed to realize the md concept@xcite .",
    "the improvement in the contrast is clearly visible .    since helices of different twisting sense do not match , all realizations of the md cell exhibit a characteristic net of line defects situated at the border of the domains .",
    "the radial extension of the disclination core is of the order of 10@xmath1 nm , _",
    "i.e. _ , much smaller than the width of one domain which amounts to 100@xmath2 m .",
    "therefore , the disclinations can be neglected for the contrast properties of the display .",
    "however the occurrence of the disclination lines depends on the choice of the tilt angle of the molecules at the surface .",
    "the free energy of a disclination line consists of a core and an elastic part . by reversing the twisting sense of one species of helices ,",
    "the disclinations are eliminated .    to accommodate the helices with the unfavorable twisting sense , additional splay deformations close to the surfaces have to be introduced . if their elastic free energy is less than the core energy of the disclination lines , the defect free configuration occurs .",
    "the reverse phenomena , the avoidance of splay deformations by introducing alternative distortions or even disclinations as in the case of the md cell , is denoted _ splay canceling_@xcite .",
    "it appears for surface tilt angles @xmath3 smaller than a maximum value @xmath4 , as illustrated in the configuration phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "note that we measure the tilt angle with respect to the normal of the plates .",
    "then @xmath5 means that the molcecules are parallel to the surface .",
    "the figure is reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite where we investigated splay cancelling by numerical means .",
    "when the md technique is used in displays , the surface anchoring has to be chosen in such a way that the chessboard pattern of left- and right - handed helices and therefore the disclination lines are always present , particularly at zero voltage .",
    "this corresponds to the lower path in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] . in section  [ subsec :",
    "display ] we will discuss the switching process of such a cell .    from a theoretical point of view the upper path in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] is of greater interest .",
    "the configuration at @xmath6 consists of helices with a common twisting sense whereas the director field in area i contains disclination lines .",
    "therefore , during the switching process a configurational transition must take place where disclinations are created or disappear .",
    "in section  [ subsec : switchonnoff ] , we examine the switching process along the upper dotted line .",
    "we investigate in detail how disclinations are nucleated via ring defects and how they are removed when line defects cross each other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theorynumerics ] we introduce the geometry of our problem , summarize the theory , and introduce the numerical methods to investigate the dynamical properties of the md cell .",
    "in addition , we provide an automated search for disclinations and explain the visualization of the transmitted light . in section  [ sec : switchconftrans ]",
    "the results of the simulations are presented , and we finish with conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in our simulations we use a realization of the multi - domain cell introduced by schadt _",
    "et al . _",
    "figure  [ fig : schematic ] gives a schematic view of the cell .",
    "cartesian coordinates are used to describe the cell geometry .",
    "the average direction of the molecules is characterized by the director @xmath7 .",
    "since it is a unit vector , we employ a twist ( @xmath8 ) and tilt ( @xmath9 ) angle to parametrize its cartesian components : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . due to a special surface treatment the lower and",
    "upper glass plates are divided into stripes pointing along the @xmath13 or @xmath14 axis , respectively .    at both plates",
    "the surface tilt angle @xmath15 assumes a common value during a simulation run , while the surface twist angle @xmath16 varies for each stripe according to table  [ tab : coords ] .",
    "the result of such a surface anchoring structure are domains of director helices with alternating twisting sense .",
    "since helices of opposite twisting sense do not match , a net of crossed twist disclinations should occur .",
    "the unit cell of our simulation box has a width and depth of @xmath17 , and its thickness is @xmath18 .",
    "we employ periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath13 and @xmath14 direction . to avoid disclinations at the boundary of the simulation box , we shifted the unit cell by @xmath19 along the @xmath13 and @xmath14 direction compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the final simulation box is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_from_top ] . for the lengths we chose @xmath20 and @xmath21 .      to obtain an initial configuration for our dynamic simulations ,",
    "we first minimize the total free energy @xmath22 of the simulation box .",
    "it consists of two parts : the elastic or frank free energy and the electric free energy :    @xmath23\\ \\text{d}^3 x \\enspace.\\ ] ]    the frank free energy density @xmath24 describes elastic distortions in the director field @xmath25 .",

    "e.g. _ , the existence of disclination lines . in a numerical simulation , one has to discretize the director derivatives . in order to avoid artificial derivatives which occur when",
    "neighboring directors are nearly anti - parallel to each other , they always have to be aligned along each other . to surpass this difficulty , we rewrite the free energy with the help of the symmetric and traceless order parameter field @xmath31 of second rank . in the uniaxial nematic phase",

    "the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath42 is @xmath55    the euler - lagrange equations were discretized on a cartesian lattice and a standard newton - gau - seidel procedure was employed @xcite to solve them .",
    "the calculated minimum energy configurations then served as initial configurations for the dynamic simulations .    to handle the dynamics of a md cell",
    ", we employed a pure rotational dynamics of the director field without any coupling to the velocity field @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a typical rotational viscosity .",
    "they were solved by an explicit time integration method@xcite .",
    "the electric potential @xmath42 was assumed to adjust instantaneously to the director rotation time scale , so that the static equation ( [ equ : eulerlagrange_volt ] ) was solved at each time step .    throughout all the simulations the values for the material parameters",
    "were chosen as in @xcite : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 = @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "at last we add a note about the disclinations . in our simulation",
    "we did not introduce an extra core energy for reasons of simplicity .",
    "as the length of the disclinations varies , it would have been too complicated numerically to correct for the core energy at each time step .",
    "we developed some tools to visualize the director field configuration in the md cell .",
    "especially , we have implemented an algorithm of automated burgers circuits to detect disclinations automatically .",
    "the algorithm adopts the conventional definition of a line defect to a grid of lattice points . to detect a line defect at a certain lattice point",

    "last , we compare the directors at the starting and end point of the loop .",
    "if they enclose an angle larger than @xmath65 , a line defect is present .",
    "whenever the angle between two neighboring directors on a loop is very close to @xmath0 , the search is performed on a loop of next - nearest neighbors . to obtain a three - dimensional picture of the position of the disclination lines",
    ", we use the virtual reality modeling language @xcite . each defect position on the grid",
    "is marked by a small sphere .",
    "all spheres together present an image of the disclination line .",
    "we also calculated the optical transmission for light incident parallel to the surface normal of the plates ( _ i.e. _ , along the negative @xmath66 axis ) based on the @xmath67 jones - matrix method  @xcite .",
    "the incident light is polarized along the @xmath13 axis at @xmath68 , and it is analysed by a polarizer along the @xmath14 axis at @xmath69 after being modified by the liquid crystal . the resulting intensity is mapped onto a greyscale .",
    "maximum transmission corresponds to white and minimum transmission to black .",
    "the resulting grey values for each grid point in the @xmath70 plane represent the transmission pattern of the liquid crystal configuration . in our calculations",
    "we always used monochromatic light of wavelength @xmath71 .",
    "the refractive indices were @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "in this section we investigate the dynamic processes in the md cell which take place during a switching process , _",
    "i.e _ , after an electric voltage of @xmath74 has been applied to or removed from the cell .",
    "we first comment on the configuration as it is used in displays , where the net of disclinations is always present ( subsection  [ subsec : display ] ) .",
    "then we consider the upper switching path in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "a configurational transition occurs where line defects have to be created or removed from the cell ( subsection  [ subsec : switchonnoff ] ) .",
    "all the simulations presented were performed on a grid with @xmath75 gridpoints in @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath66 direction , respectively .",
    "all switching times referred to in the following text and the figures are measured in milli seconds .      it would be natural to study the switching process along the lower path in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "however , we note that the tilt angle @xmath76 below which the disclinations are always present is much smaller compared to realizations of the md display . for example , schadt _ et al . _",
    "work at a tilt angle of @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have studied the occurrence of splay canceling in the md cell in detail  @xcite , and they even fabricated a display with @xmath4 as small as @xmath78 . with a rough estimate",
    ", the authors could show that the value of @xmath4 depends on the ratio of cell dimensions .",
    "if the director helix is reversed , an additional splay distortion is distributed over the whole subpixel .",
    "its total energy for two subpixels is approximated as an average frank free energy density times the volume @xmath79 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath80    the twist disclinations occur if their core energy @xmath81 is smaller than @xmath82 .",
    "the core energy is given by @xmath83 where the average frank constant @xmath84 approximates the line energy of a defect core .",
    "the transition between both configurations takes place at @xmath85 or @xmath86 with the parameters of our numerical calculations , @xmath87 , we find @xmath88 which deviates from the simulated value , @xmath76 , due to the rough estimates for the free energies involved .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ estimate ] ) demonstrates that the relatively small angle of @xmath89 results from the small lateral extension @xmath90 compared to typical pixel sizes of @xmath91 .",
    "to be closer to the experimental realization of the md display , we decided to study the switching process for a cell with pretilt angle @xmath92 . at zero voltage ( @xmath93 ) the defect configuration can nevertheless be prepared since it corresponds to a metastable state .",
    "we construct it by solving the static equation  ( [ equ : eulerlagrange_phiteta ] ) .",
    "then we set the voltage to @xmath74 and start the time integration algorithm . for characteristic times in the evolution of the director field , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : array_md_ein ] the disclination lines in the cell and in the lower right corner its light transmission .    at @xmath94 ,",
    "the defect lines are situated in the center of the cell forming a net of twist disclinations . when the voltage is turned on ,",
    "the disclinations start to move towards the glass plates ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : array_md_ein ] , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) . at their intersections",
    "they are dipped towards each other , due to an attractive interaction . when they have reached the bounding surfaces , they straighten out ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : array_md_ein ] , @xmath97 ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider the light transmission . at @xmath94 ,",
    "the disclinations can hardly be seen in the transmission pattern .",
    "when they move towards the glass plates , the contrast becomes stronger , _",
    "i.e. _ , close to the disclinations the cell switches faster compared to the rest of the display . this surprising result is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : extract_trans_alongx ] where we plot the transmission versus time close to the defect lines ( curve b ) and in the center of the display ( curve a ) .",
    "the dip in curve a between @xmath98 and @xmath99 is a well known phenomenon in a tn cell with pretilt  @xcite .",
    "the transmission characteristic of a tn cell ( see curve c ) is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : extract_trans_alongx ] .",
    "it demonstrates that far away from the disclination lines the helices in the md cell switch nearly as fast as in a pure tn display .",
    "since the lateral extension of a pixel is much larger than the core of a twist disclination , we can conclude that the motion of the defect lines does not influence the light transmission of a md display .",
    "we finish with two remarks .",
    "first , when the voltage is turned off , the motion of the disclination lines , as illustrated in the snapshots of fig .",
    "[ fig : array_md_ein ] , is simply reversed .",
    "secondly , the position of the twist disclinations as a function of the pretilt angle @xmath3 for zero voltage is the following . until @xmath100",
    "the defect lines are straight and located in the center of the cell .",
    "below @xmath100 they start to bend moving towards the glass plates but still touching each other at the intersections . at @xmath101 ,",
    "the lines lose contact , and for further decreasing @xmath3 they move closer to the surface .",
    "for the upper path in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] , we calculate the initial configuration by solving the static equation  ( [ equ : eulerlagrange_phiteta ] ) for @xmath102 . as before ,",
    "the voltage is set to @xmath74 , and the time integration algorithm is started .",
    "snapshots of the appearing disclination lines and the light transmission patterns are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dsnaps_on ] .    at @xmath103",
    "all helices have a common twisting sense .",
    "the helices of the rhds ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic_from_top ] ) turn in accordance with their boundary conditions .",
    "the helices in the lhds have reversed their twisting sense by introducing an additional splay deformation which is distributed over the whole helix .",
    "no disclinations are present . now",
    "the voltage of @xmath74 is applied and the directors start to align along the electric field . at @xmath104",
    "a clear difference can be seen between the two types of helices : in the rhds the transmission is already close to zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , the helix is destroyed since the directors are parallel to the electric field . in the lhds",
    "the transmission is almost unchanged .",
    "the helix structure is still present .",
    "we understand that feature from fig .",
    "[ fig : helixsketches](a ) where we present a schematic nail picture of the helices along a path indicated in the snap shots of the cell in fig .  [ fig:3dsnaps_on ] .",
    "note that the length of the nail is given by the projection of the director on the drawing plane and that the head symbolizes the part of the director below the drawing plane .    in the first and second helix",
    "all directors are commonly tilted towards the electric field , and they can align along the field immediately .",
    "however , the third and fourth helix , whose twisting sense is reversed by an additional splay deformation , are temporarily stabilized by the occurrence of a horizontal director . at @xmath105 , also the directors in the lhds are aligned along the electric field [ see fourth helix in fig.[fig : helixsketches](b ) ] leaving two bright stripes in the transmission pattern .",
    "they result from regions symbolized by the second and third helix in fig .  [",
    "fig : helixsketches](b ) whose directors can only be aligned along the electric field by introducing a @xmath106 wedge ( w ) and a twist ( t ) disclination , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : helixsketches](c )",
    ". these disclinations are part of one of the two defect rings which start to open up in the @xmath107 plane at @xmath105 and then grow continuously . upon touching each other at @xmath108 , they annihilate leaving a wedge and a twist disclination at the upper and lower plate , respectively .",
    "the line defects straighten out until @xmath109 .",
    "note that due to the creation of the two defect lines , one bright stripe has vanished in the transmission pattern .    at @xmath109",
    "the simulation is trapped in a local minimum . to reach the global minimum a second pair of disclinations",
    "should have been created to reduce the transmission of the second white stripe .",
    "but even then the cell is not in its gobal minimum configuration since the disclination lines at the upper plate have to point along the @xmath14 axis . to achieve a rotation of the defect lines",
    ", we propose the following mechanism . in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalrings](i ) the defect lines at the upper plates a drawn . note that in the regions 1 to 4 an additional splay deformation close to the upper surface is still present .",
    "an inspection of the director field reveals that this splay deformation can be reduced locally by opening up a disclination rings [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : finalrings](i ) ] .",
    "their right and left parts are twist disclinations whereas the upper and lower parts have a wedge character .",
    "the latter ones annihilate with the existing wedge disclinations [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : finalrings](ii ) ] , and the twist parts of the disclination ring produce the two required defect lines parallel to the @xmath14 axis .",
    "the final director field of the global minimum consists of two pairs of disclinations , parallel to the surface anchoring stripes of the respective glass plates .",

    "they are clearly visible in the transmission . at @xmath111",
    "the disclinations start to dip towards each other due to a strong attraction in the region of their crossing sections .",
    "then , at @xmath112 , recombinations of the disclinations take place which are completed at @xmath113 when a net of disclinations is situated at the center of the cell at @xmath114 .",
    "so far , the situation is similar to the md display discussed in subsection  [ subsec : display ] . here",
    ", the intersections of the disclinations eventually break up such that two line defects result ( see fig .",

    "they separate domains with right- and left - handed helices .",
    "now , our simulation is trapped in a local minimum , and the configuration does not change any more . the global minimum would be helices with a common twisting sense .",
    "it can be reached by the following scenario . at @xmath113",
    "the intersections of the line defects should break up such that a ring disclination in the center of the cell occurs which shrinks and ultimately annihilates leaving a defect - free configuration . whether this scenario does not appear in our simulation due to numerical inaccuracies or whether it is very unlikely to happen since the intersections have to break up in a very defined way , has to be answered by an experimental investigation .",
    "the concept for the md cell emerged from the need to improve the viewing angle of the conventional liquid crystal display based on the tn cell . in this paper",
    "we have studied one realization of the md cell in detail . by tilting the director against the planar orientation at the surface",
