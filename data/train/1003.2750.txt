    "advances in experimental techniques have led to a great number of experimental studies on electron transport through molecular junctions formed by single molecules bridged between electrodes or molecular monolayers adsorbed onto surfaces , using three - terminal set - ups or scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements . recently ,",
    "molecular junctions based on single - molecule magnets ( smms ) connected to electrodes or monolayers of smms at surfaces , have been fabricated and their electron transport characteristics @xcite have been measured , as well as their mechanical , electronic , and magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "electron transport through an smm drew a lot of attention because of the intriguing interplay between its transport properties and the internal magnetic degrees of freedom , which is absent in transport through small organic molecules .",
    "an smm consists of several transition metal ions interacting through organic or inorganic ligands via super - exchange interactions .",
    "the spin configuration of the ground state of an smm is determined by a delicate balance among the super - exchange interactions of different strengths between the transition metal ions .",
    "thus , the magnetic structure of an smm must be taken into account in understanding its electron transport and other quantum properties .",
    "recently , first - principles calculations of transport through an smm were performed on a prototype smm mn@xmath0 terminated with a thiol ( -s ) group within au electrodes.@xcite the calculations carried out in refs .",
    "[ ] suggest that the mn@xmath0 molecule can function as a spin filter with low bias voltage even with non - magnetic electrodes .",
    "even though the mn@xmath0 is chemically bonded to the au electrodes , the broadening of the relevant molecular orbitals is so small compared to its charging energy that the kondo temperature is expected to be extremely low . in addition , these @xcite and other calculations @xcite demonstrate the importance of the internal magnetic degrees of freedom of the mn@xmath0 in electron transport , in contrast to typical quantum dots , regardless of the specific details of the coupling of the molecule to the electrodes .",
    "systematic studies on molecular junctions based on small organic molecules reveal that the current through the molecular junctions is highly sensitive to properties of interfaces between the molecules and electrodes because the interfaces determine the degree of the overlap between the molecular levels and conduction channels of the electrodes.@xcite a thiol group is most commonly used to build a strong chemical link between the single molecules and the au electrodes in molecular junctions .",
    "the conductance of such single - molecule junctions is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath3 ( the conductance quantum ) .",
    "binding of the s atoms to the hollow sites of the au surface gives rise to different conductance ( by a factor of about 2 to 3 ) from binding of the same s atoms to on - top sites of the au surface.@xcite molecular junctions terminated with an amine ( -n ) group within au electrodes reveal even lower conductance than those with a thiol group.@xcite in order to increase conductance of molecular junctions , linker molecules including au atoms @xcite or isocyanide derivatives @xcite were used between the single molecules and electrodes .",
    "in addition , recent experiments show that conductance through molecular junctions based on small single molecules can be enhanced to an order of @xmath4 by their direct bonding to the electrodes without a thiol group or any other linker molecules.@xcite this enhancement is attributed to a strong coupling between the molecules and the electrodes , which places the transport in the transparent regime rather than in the tunneling regime.@xcite however , corresponding systematic studies have not yet been carried out for electron transport through an smm . in the case of quantum dots ,",
    "the properties of interfaces are negligible in transport . however , for molecular junctions based on smms , the molecules are chemically bonded to the electrodes , and thus their transport properties can change with different interfaces even if the molecules are weakly coupled to the electrodes in the sense that the charging energy is much greater than the broadening of the relevant molecular levels . in this paper , we investigate how bonding types , interface geometries , and geometry relaxation influence transport characteristics of an smm mn@xmath0 when it is bridged between au electrodes .",
    "an smm mn@xmath0 @xcite consists of four inner mn@xmath5 ions ( @xmath6 ) surrounded by eight outer mn@xmath7 ions ( @xmath8 ) which are all antiferromagnetically coupled through o anions , as well as c and h atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isolated - mn12geo ] .",
    "the dominant exchange interactions are between the inner mn@xmath5 ions and the outer mn@xmath7 ions.@xcite in the ground state the magnetic moments of the four mn@xmath5 ions are antiparallel to those of the eight mn@xmath7 ions , such that the total spin becomes @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite an smm mn@xmath0 initially synthesized by lis @xcite consists of ligands which do not form direct chemical bonding to an au surface .",
    "thus , most transport experiments through an mn@xmath0 within au electrodes were performed on systems where the mn@xmath0 molecules are chemically bonded to surfaces or electrodes via linker molecules such as a thiol group,@xcite or physically adsorbed onto surfaces or electrodes without any linker molecules.@xcite to form direct au - s bonding , some of the original ligands of the mn@xmath0 molecules @xcite were substituted by s - containing ligands , or the mn@xmath0 molecules were deposited onto an au surface that was initially functionalized with s - containing alkane chains.@xcite so far , the measured electric current through an mn@xmath0 molecule or its derivative in various experiments is in the range of 1 pa to 100 pa at bias voltage of a few tens of mv.@xcite compared to binding a small organic molecule to au electrodes through a thiol or amine group , binding an mn@xmath0 to au electrodes via linker molecules bears the following differences : ( a ) an mn@xmath0 has much more binding sites to the linker molecules , and ( b ) the orientation of an mn@xmath0 relative to the electrodes is , to a great extent , determined by binding sites of the linker molecules to the mn@xmath0 , rather than their binding sites to the electrodes .",

    "the ground - state spin is @xmath10 or the magnetic moment is 20 @xmath11.,height=241 ]    full control of the properties of interfaces is extremely difficult to achieve in molecular junctions and tunneling measurements using stm or scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts).@xcite thus , in transport experiments , for a given bonding type , several binding sites are plausible , and hundreds of fabricated samples of the bonding type give rise to a histogram of conductance for given gate voltage or a series of current - voltage curves . in the present study",
    ", we take into account five different bonding types between an mn@xmath0 and au electrodes , and for each bonding type , some representative interface geometries are examined . even though we do not simulate all possible configurations of the interface that may be realized in fabricated samples for a given bonding type ,",
    "the general trend in our calculated transport properties will elucidate the effects of linker group , molecular orientation , and geometry relaxation , as well as the effectiveness of different bonding types and interface geometries in transport through an mn@xmath0 and other smms .    in this work , we consider an mn@xmath0 molecule bridged between au(111 ) electrodes ( two - terminal set - up ) via nine different ways ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) , and investigate their current - voltage characteristics using the density - functional theory ( dft ) and the nonequilibrium green s function method ( negf ) .",
    "the nine different ways can be categorized according to their bonding types : ( i ) au - s bonding , ( ii ) au - c bonding , ( iii ) au - au bonding , ( iv ) au - h bonding , and ( v ) physisorption through van der waals forces .",
    "dft does not fully capture the nature of van der waals forces where the orbitals considered do not overlap .",
    "we note , however , that if molecular orbitals do not overlap with the orbitals of electrodes at a molecular junction , the transport properties of the junction belong to the tunneling regime .",
    "a recent study reveals that first - principles calculations based on dft and negf provide qualitative features of transport in such a regime.@xcite for example , when a pt break junction becomes broken with vacuum between the electrodes , a first - principles calculation showed exponentially decaying conductance as a function of distance between the electrodes .",
    "@xcite this result suggests that our methodology can be used to understand the transport in the case of physisorption , although the physical mechanism in our case differs from that in the broken junction . in the present calculations , we consider two molecular orientations relative to the electrodes : when the magnetic easy axis of the mn@xmath0 is normal [ orientation ( 1 ) ] or parallel [ orientation ( 2 ) ] to the transport direction , the @xmath12 axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] .",
    "the structure of the mn@xmath0 dictates that in the orientation ( 1 ) one linker molecule can be attached to each electrode without significantly deforming the mn@xmath0 , while in the orientation ( 2 ) , two linker molecules are possibly accommodated for each electrode without much distortion . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] , the nine different interface geometries are named based on the following rule . adapted from the notations used in refs .",
    "[ ] , we refer to the orientation ( 1 ) as geo 1 , and to the orientation ( 2 ) as geo 2 . for each interface geometry ,",
    "the orientation of an mn@xmath0 is first specified , then the type of adsorption ( either chemical or physical ) is given .",
    "for chemical bonding , the type of bonding and the name of the linker group are noted , while for physisorption , whether linker molecules are placed or not is stated .",
    "for example , geo 1:au-(sc@xmath13h@xmath14)@xmath15-hollow [ fig .",
    "[ fig : geo](a ) ] denotes an interface geometry with the mn@xmath0 in the orientation ( 1 ) and the linker molecule ( sc@xmath13h@xmath14)@xmath15 bonded to the hollow sites of the electrodes via au - s bonding .",
    "we will first outline our model and computational method .",
    "then we will discuss the interface geometries in detail , and the effects of geometry relaxation , molecular orientation , bonding type , and linker group on transport properties of the mn@xmath0 .",
    "a brief conclusion will follow .",
    "we use the quantum transport code smeagol @xcite interfaced with the dft code siesta@xcite .",
    "the au electrodes are treated semi - infinitely using siesta .",
    "the scattering region consists of the mn@xmath0 , linker molecules , and six flat au atomic layers on each side of the mn@xmath0 ( @xmath16 surface atoms per layer ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] .",
    "even if the number of the au atomic layers increases from six to nine on each side of the mn@xmath0 , the transmission probability does not change at all .",
    "this was tested and confirmed for the interface geometry with the au - c bonding [ geo 1:au-(c@xmath13h@xmath14)@xmath15 , fig .",
    "[ fig : geo](c ) ] , where the broadening of the relevant molecular level turns out to be the largest among the interface geometries considered .",
    "the electronic structures of the electrodes and scattering region are calculated within the spin - polarized perdew - burke - ernzerhopf ( pbe ) generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite , using siesta .",
    "we generate troullier - martins pseudopotentials @xcite for au , mn , s , o , c , and h with scalar relativistic terms and core corrections except for h. we also build corresponding basis sets of the elements using the scheme presented in ref .  [ ] . for the mn basis set , 3@xmath17 orbitals as a semicore are required in order for the molecular orbital levels of an isolated mn@xmath0 to be comparable to those obtained from all - electron calculations @xcite . with these pseudopotentials and basis sets , self - consistent dft calculations including spin - orbit coupling @xcite are performed for an isolated mn@xmath0 . using a modified version @xcite of siesta",
    ", we obtain the total magnetic moment of 20 @xmath11 and the magnetic anisotropy barrier of 66.4  k,@xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with experiment @xcite and with the barrier @xcite computed using the dft code vasp@xcite . to reduce the computational cost , a small au basis set of a single @xmath18 orbital",
    "is used for transport calculations , while a large au basis set of both @xmath19 and @xmath18 orbitals is used for geometry relaxation .",
    "the transmission at the fermi level in au is dominated by the @xmath18 states because the @xmath19 orbital levels are well below the fermi level .",
    "it is checked that in the scattering region , the density of states projected onto mn @xmath19 orbitals with the large au basis set is fairly similar to that with the small au basis set , which justifies the utilization of the small au basis set in the transport study . for a given interface geometry ,",
    "the distance @xmath19 between the electrodes was determined such that all of the terminating atoms from the linker molecules ( such as s , c , or au atoms ) are bonded to the lowest - energy sites of the the au slab with reasonable bond lengths .",
    "for example , for the au - s bonding , the distance @xmath19 was obtained from an optimum bond length between a s - terminated alkane chain and the hollow site of a small au cluster . in constructing the initial geometry of the scattering region , each component of the region , such as the electrodes , the mn@xmath0 , and the linker molecules ,",
    "are separately optimized in advance .",
    "the largest force is found at the interface between the linker molecules and the electrodes.@xcite thus , the geometry relaxation with a fixed @xmath19 allows the linker molecules and the mn@xmath0 to relax further and lowers the force at the interface .",
    "prior to the transport calculations , all of the geometries of the scattering region or interface geometries considered are relaxed with a fixed distance @xmath19 between the electrodes , using siesta , until the magnitude of the maximum force exerted on the atoms becomes less than 0.1 ev /  ,  unless stated otherwise .    to avoid any quantum confinement effects,@xcite for the scattering region ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in the transverse directions and @xmath20 @xmath21-points are sampled .",
    "the retarded green function for the scattering region , @xmath22 , has the form of @xmath23^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the overlap and hamiltonian matrices for the scattering region , respectively.@xcite here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are self - energies arising from the interactions of the mn@xmath0 with the left and right electrodes , respectively .",
    "these self - energies depend on energy @xmath28 and @xmath21 vector , and they are obtained from spin - polarized calculations of retarded surface green functions for the electrodes which are computed using the scheme developed in ref .",
    "the initial magnetic moment of the scattering region is set to 20 @xmath11 .",
    "interactions with phonons or additional electron correlations such as on - site coulomb repulsion ( hubbard - like @xmath29 term ) are not taken into account .",
    "the density matrix of the scattering region is self - consistently solved within the negf formalism until it converges .",
    "after the convergence of the density matrix , the total magnetic moment slightly increases , such as 20.3 @xmath11 for geo 1:au-(sc@xmath13h@xmath14)@xmath15-hollow , due to a small amount of spin polarization in the au atomic layers caused by the mn@xmath0 .",

    "accurate calculations of @xmath30 require high resolution in energy @xmath28 ( such as @xmath35ev for very sharp transmission peaks ) due to the weak coupling between the mn@xmath0 and the electrodes .",
    "since the electrodes are treated semi - infinitely and periodic boundary conditions are employed , the transmission coefficients are obtained after their integration over the @xmath21-points .",

    "these four mn sites mainly contribute to the minority - spin density of states as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pdos - sp1 ] and [ fig : pdos - sp2 ] . due to this proximity of the four mn sites ,",
    "the minority - spin dos for the geometries in the orientation ( 2 ) is more spread than that for the geometries in the orientaion ( 1 ) .",
    "an additional reason is as follows . as discussed earlier and",
    "shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pdos - sp1 ] , [ fig : pdos - sp2 ] , and [ fig : pdos - sp3 ] , the lumo arises from the majority - spin mn @xmath19 orbitals . at the energy level where the ratio is obtained ,",
    "the majority - spin transmission is of the order of unity , independent of the distance @xmath19 , because the transport is carried by the lumo level .",
    "however , at that energy level , the transport of minority - spin electrons is in the tunneling regime , since there are no corresponding molecular levels of the minority - spin .",
    "thus , the minority - spin transmission decreases exponentially with @xmath19 . since the geometries in the orientation ( 1 ) have much longer distances @xmath19 than those in the orientation ( 2 ) , the coefficients of the minority - spin transmission for the former geometries are much smaller than those for the latter geometries .",
    "this renders the greatly enhanced ratio for the geometries in the orientation ( 1 ) .",
    "now let us briefly discuss the influence of bonding type on the spin - filtering effect .",
    "for the orientation ( 1 ) the minority - spin dos for the au - c bonding is slightly broader than that for the au - s bonding [ compare fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos - sp1](a ) to ( b ) ] .",
    "thus , the ratio for the au - c bonding is lower than that for the au - s bonding ( table 1 ) for a given distance @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , for the orientation ( 2 ) , the minority - spin dos for the au - s bonding is more delocalized than that for the au - h bonding [ compare fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos - sp2](a ) to ( b ) ] .",
    "so the ratio for the au - s bonding is lower than that for the au - h bonding for a given distance @xmath19 . for a specific bonding type ,",
    "the ratio increases with increasing the distance @xmath19 because of the reason explained above .",
    "for example , for the au - s bonding , the minority - spin pdos for geo 2:au-(sc@xmath15h@xmath41)@xmath41 is much more localized than that for geo 2:au - s@xmath41 [ compare fig .  [",
    "fig : pdos - sp3 ] to [ fig : pdos - sp2](a ) ] .",
    "thus , the ratio for the former is two orders of magnitude greater than that for the latter .",
    "additionally , we note from figs .",
    "[ fig : trc ] and [ fig : trc - log ] that this ratio , @xmath76 , remains in the range of 100 to 10@xmath82 even at the energy level where the transport of both the majority spin and the minority spin is in the tunneling regime .",
    "the spin - filtering effect may be achieved for other smms with high magnetic moments and stable ground - state spin multiplets .",
    "we investigate the effect of binding site on transport properties for a given bonding type , for example , the au - s bonding in the orientation ( 1 ) , geo 1:au-(sc@xmath13h@xmath14)@xmath15 .",
    "we consider hollow and on - top binding sites of the s atoms to the au surface in that geometry , without geometry relaxation .",
    "the broadening of the lumo level somewhat decreases from the hollow - site to the on - top geometries , while the broadening of the homo level slightly increases ( table  1 ) .",
    "this difference in the broadening is much smaller than that induced by different bonding types . despite this small difference , the overall features of @xmath45 for the two geometries are fairly similar to each other , as shown in fig .  [",

    "<S> we examine theoretically coherent electron transport through the single - molecule magnet mn@xmath0 , bridged between au(111 ) electrodes , using the non - equilibrium green s function method and the density - functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the effects of bonding type , molecular orientation , and geometry relaxation on the electronic properties and charge and spin transport across the single - molecule junction . </S>",
    "<S> we consider nine interface geometries leading to five bonding mechanisms and two molecular orientations : ( i ) au - c bonding , ( ii ) au - au bonding , ( iii ) au - s bonding , ( iv ) au - h bonding , and ( v ) physisorption via van der waals forces . </S>",
    "<S> the two molecular orientations of mn@xmath0 correspond to the magnetic easy axis of the molecule aligned perpendicular [ hereafter denoted as orientation ( 1 ) ] or parallel [ orientation ( 2 ) ] to the direction of electron transport . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the electron transport is carried by the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) level in all the cases that we have simulated . </S>",
    "<S> relaxation of the junction geometries mainly shifts the relevant occupied molecular levels toward the fermi energy as well as slightly reduces the broadening of the lumo level . as a result , the current slightly decreases at low bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations also show that placing the molecule in the orientation ( 1 ) broadens the lumo level much more than in the orientation ( 2 ) , due to the internal structure of the mn@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , junctions with the former orientation yield a higher current than those with the latter . among all of the bonding types considered , </S>",
    "<S> the au - c bonding gives rise to the highest current ( about one order of magnitude higher than the au - s bonding ) , for a given distance between the electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> the current through the junction with other bonding types decreases in the order of au - au , au - s , and au - h . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the spin - filtering effect in all the nine geometries stays robust and their ratios of the majority - spin to the minority - spin transmission coefficients are in the range of 10@xmath1 to 10@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the general trend in transport among the different bonding types and molecular orientations obtained from this study may be applied to other single - molecular magnets . </S>"
