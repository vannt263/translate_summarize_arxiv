    "the ability to manipulate single charges provides access to various phenomena related to the quantization of electric charge  @xcite and has found important applications in the field of electrical metrology  @xcite .",
    "corresponding devices are driven by alternating signals of a certain frequency @xmath2 in such a way , that an integer number @xmath3 of electron charges is _ pumped _ through the device per cycle . the resulting _ quantized _ current , @xmath4 , can therefore be traced directly to the electron charge @xmath1 ( we reserve @xmath5 to denote the fundamental constant of elementary charge ) .",
    "besides their potential application as a single - electron based current standard they play an important role in the ongoing process of restructuring the international system of units ( si )  @xcite .",
    "although most of the recent developments discussed in the present report have been focused around the metrological goals of fast and accurate single - electron delivery , the few - electron on - demand sources built with metrology - inspired technology have already found basic science applications in investigations of few - body mesoscopic physics and the development of tunable circuit elements for electron quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the scope and organization of the report is best illustrated by explaining the meaning of the title .",
    "quantized pumping may be realized by employing an energy gap for removal / addition of single electrons to a small conductor  @xcite , e.g.  a metallic island or a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "there is a trade - off in designing the tunnel barriers between the qd and leads : the conductance should be low enough to suppress charge fluctuations ( and thus keep @xmath3 well - defined ) but not too small to allow enough time for charge loading and unloading ( and thus push up the operation frequency @xmath2 and hence the output current level ) .",
    "hence the circuits based on _ fixed _ tunnel barriers naturally lend themselves to the realization of _ adiabatic _ pumping schemes where the number of confined charges is kept close to equilibrium ( defined by the leads and the environment ) during most parts of the operation cycle .",
    "a notable example of a successful implementation of the adiabatic approach is the development of single - electron - tunneling pumps consisting of a series of small metallic islands  @xcite or , recently , atomic donor states @xcite coupled by fixed tunnel barriers . using this principle keller  _ et al . _",

    ", the field of accurate quantized current sources has shifted towards a novel direction in which the speed versus precision trade - off is optimized by employing _",
    "tunable barriers _ with a sufficiently wide dynamical range ( typically relying on field - induced conductance pinch - off in semiconductors , see section 2.1 below ) . in such devices",
    "a precise number of electrons can be trapped on the qd at potential levels multiple charging energies away from the external electrochemical potential , making the pumping cycle strongly _ non - adiabatic _ with respect to electron number equilibrium along the charge transfer path .",
    "non - adiabatic pumping relies on switching charge exchange with external reservoirs on and off in a well - defined and temporally separate manner and thus enables greater flexibility and simplicity in design and analysis of quantized charge transfer protocols compared to entirely adiabatic schemes .",
    "this admittedly narrow scope for defining non - adiabaticity is further explained in sections [ sec : plungerbarrier ] and [ sec : modintro ] ; it should not be confused with inevitable deviations from strict instantaneous equilibrium due to irreversible excitations of gapless degrees of freedom . at the time of writing optimized tunable barrier",
    "pumps operating in the ghz frequency range have been demonstrated to beat the uncertainty limit of state - of - the - art current - measurement setups  , which lies around @xmath7  @xcite .",

    "an example of a heterostructure combining algaas and gaas is shown figure  [ fig : barrier ] along with a graph tracing the corresponding conduction ( @xmath8 ) and valence band ( @xmath9 ) edges as function of the coordinate perpendicular to the layers .",
    "doping profiles are designed to shift band edges with respect to the fermi level ( @xmath10 ) in order to populate the interface regions , also called quantum wells ( qw ) , with charge carriers .",

    "the latter can be achieved by , e.g. , ion bombardment or etching  @xcite .",
    "a deep etch would remove the qw completely , while in a shallow etch the resulting close proximity of the qw to the surface causes depletion of carriers from it .",
    "note that a high density of surface states may lead to pinning of @xmath10 at the surface in some materials .",
    "the doping profile can also be engineered so that a shallow surface etch causes a change of carrier type  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : barrier ] .",
    "tunable barriers along the wire can be achieved by imposing spatially varying electrostatic potentials shifting the energy band locally .",

    "negatively biased metal gates on the surface not only confine the carriers along a narrow wire but also form constrictions at @xmath16 m distance along the transport channel . lowering the backgate voltage @xmath14 the electron density under the gates is reduced , which leads to a corresponding decrease in conduction and tunneling .",
    "the calculated variation of the conduction band edge is plotted as function of position along the channel in figure  [ fig : barrier_lat](c ) . at @xmath17mv",
    "the minimum in the potential between the barriers drops just below the fermi energy ( zero level in the figure ) .",
    "this results in electron accumulation in this region .",
    "further increase of the gate voltage lowers the barriers , so that at about @xmath18mv the qd definition is lost .",
