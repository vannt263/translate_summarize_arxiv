    "gamma - ray line is generally thought to be a smoking gun observation of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "recently , bringmann _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and weniger @xcite reported that there might be hint of a monochromatic @xmath0-ray line with energy @xmath4 gev in the data recorded by fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0-ray line could be explained by @xmath2 gev dm particle annihilation , with the velocity - weighted cross section @xmath5 .",
    "this phenomenon was confirmed by a series of independent analyses @xcite .",
    "it was argued that such a line - like structure might originate from astrophysical emission related with the fermi bubbles @xcite but the morphology analysis indicated that it is not the case @xcite .",
    "based on the identified spectral and spatial variations of rich structures of the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission in the inner galaxy , boyarsky _ et .",
    "al . _ argued against the dm origin of these structures @xcite .",
    "however , the dm origin of the @xmath0-ray line emission has been strengthened by su & finkbeiner @xcite and by yang et al . @xcite .",
    "the independent analyses to search for @xmath0-ray lines in the milky way halo by fermi - lat collaboration @xcite and in dwarf galaxies by @xcite found no significant signal , but the constraints are not tight enough to exclude such a @xmath0-ray line signal .",
    "it was also proposed that such a line - like signal could be tested with high energy resolution detectors in the near future @xcite .",
    "several models had been proposed to explain this tentative line structure @xcite .",
    "several years ago atic experiment discovered significant excess in the @xmath6 energy spectrum between @xmath7 gev , moreover the @xmath6 energy spectrum also showed possible wiggle - like structure at @xmath1 gev @xcite , which has been studied by a few research groups @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 spectra measured by pamela and fermi - lat both revealed tentative fine structure above @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore a natural question one would ask is whether there is any connection between the @xmath10 gev line - like structure of @xmath0-rays and the wiggle structure of electrons .    in this letter",
    ", we focus on the pamela / fermi - lat electron data and show that the dm scenario with mass @xmath2 gev corresponding to the possible @xmath0-ray line , might contribute to the tentative fine structure of the @xmath8 spectra around @xmath11 gev . together with the pamela / fermi - lat positron fraction @xcite data , we set a constraint on the velocity - averaged cross section @xmath12 @xmath13 s@xmath14 , consistent with all of the current bounds of the indirect detection measurements .",
    "considering the large uncertainties of the current data , more advanced and dedicated experimental observations , in particular by ams-02 , are highly necessary to pin down the shape of the electron and positron spectrum , and then confirm or rule out a dm component in accordance with the @xmath2 gev @xmath15ray line .",
    "the cosmic ray ( cr ) propagation equation is written as follows @xcite : @xmath16-\\frac{\\psi}{\\tau_{f}}-\\frac{\\psi}{\\tau_{r}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the density per unit of total particle momentum , @xmath18 is the source distribution function , @xmath19 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath20 is the convection velocity , @xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient in momentum space , @xmath22 is the momentum loss rate , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the time scales of fragmentation and radioactive decay .",
    "in general it is difficult to solve the propagation equation with analytical method , given the complicated distributions of the source , interstellar matter , radiation field and magnetic field .",
    "numerical methods are developed to solve the propagation equations , such as galprop @xcite and dragon @xcite . in this work",
    "we adopt the galprop package to calculate the propagation of the cr particles , including the contribution from dm annihilation .",
    "the diffusion - reacceleration ( dr ) and diffusion - convection ( dc ) models of cr propagation are adopted as illustration .",
    "the main parameters of propagation and source injection are compiled in table .",
    "[ table1 ] .",
    "these set of propagation parameters can fit the observational b / c , @xmath25be/@xmath26be and proton data @xcite .",
    ".the propagation parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]    we may further note that the dm signal , if exists , will be more prominent in the positron fraction than in the electron spectrum . as shown in figures [ fig",
    ": dr ] and [ fig : dc ] , the relative excess of the dm component is only @xmath27 compared with the background @xmath28 pulsar flux .",
    "however , for the positron fraction the contribution of the dm component could be more than @xmath29 ( relative to the background @xmath28 pulsar components ) for the best fit cross section @xmath30 @xmath13 s@xmath14 .      the observations of @xmath0-rays ( the internal bremsstrahlung and inverse compton radiation component ) and/or radio emission ( the synchrotron radiation component ) may constrain the current scenario that dm annihilates into electrons / positrons @xcite .",
    "the lack of evident continual spectrum component associated with the 130 gev @xmath0-ray line from the galactic center suggests that the dm particles mainly annihilate into final states with few @xmath0-rays ( such as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , or neutrinos ) , otherwise the observed relic density can not be explained @xcite .",
    "such a speculation is one of the main motivation of this work .",
    "it was shown that the latest @xmath0-ray observations by fermi - lat can constrain the @xmath33 to the level of @xmath34 @xmath35 s@xmath14 for dm mass @xmath1 gev @xcite , which is much larger than the constraint ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) yielded in this work .",
    "the spectra of the cr electrons detected by pamela and fermi - lat both show small wiggle - like structure at @xmath1 gev , potentially consisting of a weak signal of @xmath2 gev dm particles annihilating into electrons / positrons with a cross section @xmath37 .",
    "it maybe connect with the recently reported @xmath4 gev @xmath0-ray line emission which may be the result of dm annihilation in the milky way .",
    "we investigate the contribution to the electron spectrum and positron fraction of such a dm component .",
    "it is found that adding the @xmath10 gev dm component can improve the fit to the data , but the improvement is not significant enough .",
    "we further use the current data to set constraints on the dm annihilation cross section to @xmath38 .    as found in our modeling ,",
    "the dm - origin electrons / positrons , if there are , are likely less than @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) of the background @xmath28 pulsar @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) flux at @xmath2 gev .",
    "hence , accurate measurements of the spectrum of the electrons ( and positrons ) by ams-02 and dampe / calet are highly necessary to test the dm origin of the wiggle - like structure ( see table 2 for the expected performance of ams-02 in order to identify such a component ) . finally we would like to point out that it may be easier to identify a dm - origin positron component than the electron component due to lower flux of the corresponding  background \" .",
