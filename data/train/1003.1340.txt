    "observed star formation takes place within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , so understanding how these clouds form and evolve is a key step towards understanding star formation on galactic scales .",
    "the main chemical constituent of any gmc is molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath4 ) .",
    "however , it is extremely difficult to directly observe this molecular hydrogen _ in situ_. radiative transitions in h@xmath4 are weak , owing to the molecule s lack of a permanent dipole moment .",
    "moreover , the lowest lying rotational energy levels of h@xmath4 are widely spaced , and so are very rarely excited in gas with the temperatures typical of gmcs , @xmath520  k. for this reason it is common to use emission from carbon monoxide ( co ) , the second most abundant molecule in gmcs , as a proxy for the h@xmath4 .    in order to use co as a proxy for h@xmath4 , however , it is necessary to understand the relationship between the distributions of these two molecules .",
    "both are readily dissociated by the absorption of ultraviolet photons with energies below the lyman limit of atomic hydrogen , so in low density , low extinction gas such as the warm neutral component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the abundances of both molecules will be small . however , the two molecules form rather differently : h@xmath4 forms predominantly on the surface of dust grains @xcite , while co forms almost exclusively in the gas phase , via any one of a number of chains of ion - neutral or neutral - neutral reactions ( see e.g.  @xcite for a useful summary of co formation chemistry ) .",
    "moreover , h@xmath4 can protect itself from ultraviolet radiation via self - shielding , which becomes effective for relatively low h@xmath4 column densities @xcite .",
    "the corresponding process for co is less effective @xcite , requiring a higher column density , and the low abundance of carbon relative to hydrogen in the ism means that the required column density typically corresponds to a situation in which a large fraction of the available carbon is already locked up in the form of co. for these reasons , we would expect the co / h@xmath4 ratio to vary through a cloud , and this expectation is confirmed by detailed models of slab - like or spherical clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these find that the transition from atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen occurs at a point closer to the cloud surface than the transition from ionized carbon , via neutral atomic carbon , to co.    although spatial variations in the co / h@xmath4 ratio within a gmc would appear to make it difficult to use co as a proxy for h@xmath4 , observations of galactic gmcs show that in fact there appears to be a good correlation between the integrated intensity of the @xmath6 rotational transition line of @xmath7co and the h@xmath4 column density ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a number of independent studies have shown that gmcs in the galactic disk all have co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factors that are approximately @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the velocity - integrated intensity of the co @xmath10 emission line , averaged over the projected area of the gmc , and @xmath11 is the mean h@xmath4 column density of the gmc , averaged over the same area .",
    "although the former can be directly observed , the latter can not .",
    "however , for nearby clouds , it can be inferred from measurements of the diffuse @xmath12-ray flux produced by interactions between high energy cosmic rays and atomic hydrogen , atomic helium and h@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath12-ray flux along a given line of sight depends on the total hydrogen column density along that line of sight .",
    "since the atomic hydrogen column density can be measured via its 21  cm emission , the h@xmath4 column density can be inferred .",
    "as the values for @xmath13 obtained in this way are consistent with those obtained by assuming that the gmcs are in virial equilibrium and using the observed linewidth - size relation to compute the cloud mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is generally accepted that co emission is indeed a good proxy for h@xmath4 mass in nearby gmcs .",
    "however , the issue of the environmental dependence of @xmath13 remains highly contentious . in gas with a lower metallicity , or a higher ambient uv radiation field , co photodissociation will be more effective , and the amount of co in the cloud will be smaller , with the co - rich gas occupying a smaller volume than in the galactic case ( e.g.  @xcite , molina et  al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the mean h@xmath4 abundance may also be smaller , but the greater role played by h@xmath4 self - shielding means that we do not expect the h@xmath4 abundance to be nearly as sensitive to changes in the metallicity . because of this , there are good theoretical reasons to expect the relationship between co emission and h@xmath4 mass to change as we change the metallicity .",
    "however , observational efforts to test this yield inconsistent results .    measurements of @xmath13 that assume that extragalactic gmcs are in virial equilibrium and use a virial analysis to determine the cloud mass generally find values for @xmath13 that are similar to those obtained in the milky way , with at most a weak metallicity dependence @xcite . on the other hand , measurements that constrain gmc masses using other techniques that do not depend on the co emission , such as by measuring the far - infrared dust emission ,",
    "consistently find values for @xmath13 that are much larger than the galactic value and that are suggestive of a strong metallicity dependence @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations provide us with one way to address this observational dichotomy .",
    "if we can understand the distribution of co and h@xmath4 in realistic models of gmcs , then we may begin to understand why the different types of observation give such different results .",
    "however , until very recently , the ability of simulations to address this issue has been quite limited .",
    "sophisticated treatments of gas and grain chemistry , radiative heating and cooling , and radiative transfer have been developed to model gmcs ( see , for instance , the paper by * ? ? ?",
    "* which compares results from a number of popular codes ) , but the very complexity of these models limits their applicability to highly simplified geometries :",
    "typically the adopted cloud models are one - dimensional , assuming either spherical symmetry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a semi - infinite , uniform slab ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the modelling often assumes that the chemistry of the clouds is in equilibrium , which is valid only if all of the chemical timescales are much shorter than any dynamical timescale associated with the gmcs . since real gmcs",
    "are observed to be highly inhomogeneous , and to be dominated by supersonic turbulent motions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the applicability of the results from these simple spherical or slab models to real clouds is open to question . on the other hand , previous attempts to accurately model the turbulent dynamics of gmcs , and the inhomogeneous and intermittent density structure that is created by this turbulence typically have avoided modelling the cloud chemistry , rendering them also of limited use in addressing this question . the few studies that have attempted to model both the turbulence and the chemistry self - consistently ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have typically done so by reducing the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "for instance , @xcite present results on the chemical evolution of gas passing through magnetized , turbulent vortices , using two - dimensional simulations of these vortices , and then construct models for lines of sight through diffuse clouds by summing up the contributions from a number of different vortices . however , it is unclear whether the results obtained in this fashion are the same as those that would be obtained using a fully three - dimensional model for the turbulence .    in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we presented the first results from a project that aims to combine detailed chemical modelling with three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical turbulence simulations in order to self - consistently model both the chemistry and the turbulent dynamics of the gas within a gmc .",
    "we showed that it is now computationally feasible to attempt this .",
    "provided one makes a few simplifying assumptions regarding the extent of the chemistry to be treated , and the treatment of the uv radiation field , it is possible to model both the h@xmath4 and the co chemistry of a gmc with acceptable accuracy within a moderate resolution dynamical simulation .",
    "paper  i presented results from a few trial simulations performed using only one set of cloud properties ( mean density , metallicity , etc ) .",
    "in this paper , we present results from a much larger set of simulations that examine the sensitivity of h@xmath4 and co formation to changes in the mean densities and metallicities of gmcs , and explore the consequences of this for the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor and the dynamical structure of the observed clouds .    in section  [ sims ]",
    ", we discuss our numerical approach and the initial conditions used for our simulations . in section  [ res ] ,",
    "we present the main results of our simulations , and use them to derive the approximate dependence of the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor on cloud properties . in section  [ dis ] , we discuss the major consequences of our findings . in section  [ cave ] , we discuss a few potential caveats regarding our approach , and show why they are unlikely to significantly affect our main results",
    ". finally , in section  [ summ ] , we close with a brief summary .",
    "our simulations were performed using a modified version of the zeus - mp magnetohydrodynamical code @xcite fully described in paper  i. our modifications include the addition of a simplified treatment of hydrogen , carbon and oxygen chemistry , composed of 218 reactions between 32 chemical species , together with a detailed atomic and molecular cooling function .",
    "this treatment includes the formation of h@xmath4 on the surface of dust grains , following a prescription taken from @xcite .",
    "the formation rate of h@xmath4 per unit volume due to grain surface reactions is written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath16 is the number density of atomic hydrogen , @xmath17 is the metallicity of the gas , and @xmath18 is the rate coefficient for h@xmath4 formation , given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gas temperature in units of 100  k , @xmath21 is the dust temperature in units of 100  k , and where @xmath22 for simplicity , we fix the dust temperature at 10  k in all of the simulations presented in this paper . aside from this reaction , we include no other grain surface chemistry in our current models .",
    "we model the photodissociation of h@xmath4 using prescriptions for dust shielding and h@xmath4 self - shielding taken from @xcite . for co photodissociation , we account for dust shielding , co self - shielding and shielding by h@xmath4 , using shielding functions taken from @xcite for the last two terms . to compute the column densities of dust , h@xmath4 and co required by this treatment of photodissociation",
    ", we use the six - ray approximation introduced in @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", we compute photochemical rates in each zone in our simulation volume by averaging over the six lines of sight that lie parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "all of our simulations begin with an initially uniform gas distribution , with mean hydrogen nucleus number density @xmath23 .",
    "the initial temperature of the gas is 60  k. however , because the cooling time of the gas is significantly shorter than the dynamical time in all but our lowest density runs , the gas temperature quickly adjusts itself until the gas is close to thermal equilibrium , and hence our results are largely insensitive to our choice for the initial temperature .",
    "the initial velocity field is turbulent , with uniform power between wavenumbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and with an initial rms velocity of 5  @xmath26 .",
    "we drive the turbulence so as to maintain approximately the same rms velocity throughout the simulation , following the method described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume that the gas is magnetized , with an initially uniform magnetic field strength @xmath27 and a field that is initially oriented parallel to the @xmath28-axis of the simulation .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the timescale for h@xmath4 formation in a turbulent , magnetized cloud is relatively insensitive to the value chosen for the magnetic field strength , and hence we do not expect our results to be particularly sensitive to our choice of @xmath29 .",
    "the particular value that we have chosen is the same as we adopted in paper  i , and is motivated by the 21  cm observations by @xcite that find a median magnetic field strength of @xmath30 for the cold neutral medium .",
    "we assume that the gas has a uniform metallicity @xmath17 , and that the initial fractional abundances ( by number ) of carbon and oxygen relative to hydrogen are given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 refer to carbon and oxygen in all forms ( ionized , neutral , or incorporated into molecules ) . for solar metallicity",
    ", this corresponds to the values given in @xcite . as in @xcite ,",
    "we ignore the effects of metals other than c or o , in order to minimize the computational requirements of our simulations .",
    "we assume a standard dust - to - gas ratio for our solar metallicity runs , and also assume that in our lower metallicity runs , the dust - to - gas ratio scales linearly with metallicity .",
    "we assume that the dust has an extinction curve characterized by @xmath35 , and that this is independent of metallicity .",
    "we also fix the dust temperature at @xmath36 in every run .",
    "we adopt a fixed cosmic ray ionization rate @xmath37 . for the majority of our simulations ,",
    "we use the same spectral shape and normalization for the interstellar radiation field as in @xcite . for brevity ,",
    "when we refer to the strength of the radiation field in a simulation , we typically give it in terms of @xmath38 , the ratio of the field strength relative to the strength of the draine field .",
    "thus , in the majority of our simulations , @xmath39 .",
    "we also performed a few simulations without a radiation background , i.e.  with @xmath40 .",
    "the effects of increasing @xmath38 to much larger values are examined in a separate paper ( glover et  al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "we perform our simulations in a cubical volume of side @xmath41 , to which we apply periodic boundary conditions .",
    "as we have previously noted in paper  i , the use of periodic boundary conditions for the gas together with what are effectively non - periodic boundary conditions for the radiation is not self - consistent , and we adopt this arrangement purely for the computational convenience that it offers .",
    "we do not include the effects of self - gravity in our current simulations , but intend to explore them in future work .",
    "we have performed simulations with a range of different initial densities @xmath23 and metallicities @xmath17 , as detailed in table  [ tab : sims ] . for most of these simulations ,",
    "we set @xmath42 , but we have also performed a few simulations with @xmath43 .",
    "for all of these simulations , we adopt a numerical resolution of @xmath44 zones , which we showed in paper  i was sufficient to yield converged results for the mass - weighted mean abundances of co and h@xmath4 , at least to the level of accuracy required here .",
    "we evolved all of our runs until @xmath45 , corresponding to roughly three eddy turnover times for the turbulence . in paper  i",
    ", we showed that this gave sufficient time for the density distribution , temperature distribution and the chemical abundance of co all to reach a statistical steady state .",
    "we expect the same to be true for the majority of runs examined here .",
    "however , as we will see later , there is evidence that the co abundance in some of our lowest density runs has not reached a steady state by @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , in four of our lowest density runs ( runs n30 , n100 , n30-z01 and n100-z01 ) , we did not stop at this point , but continued to evolve them until a time @xmath47",
    ". we note , however , that it is questionable whether real molecular clouds could live for so long without undergoing localized gravitational collapse and forming stars , physics that is not included in our current models .",
    ".list of simulations [ tab : sims ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us now turn our attention from the density and temperature of the gas to its chemical content .",
    "in table  [ tab : fractions ] , we list the mass - weighted mean abundances of h@xmath4 and co , denoted @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , at our default end - point @xmath50 , for each of the simulations that we have run .",
    "these mean abundances are defined as @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively , where @xmath53 is the total mass in the simulation , @xmath54 is the volume of a single grid zone , @xmath55 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei in zone @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the h@xmath4 and co number densities in the same zone , @xmath59 is the mass density in that zone , and where we sum over all grid zones .",
    "note that the inclusion of the factor of two in our definition of @xmath48 is to ensure that when the hydrogen is fully molecular , we will have @xmath60 , rather than 0.5 , as this will hopefully be less confusing for the reader .    in figure  [ mol - av]a , we plot the values of @xmath48 at @xmath46 as a function of the mean visual extinction , @xmath61 , and in figure  [ mol - av]b , we give a similar plot of the values of @xmath49 at @xmath46 .",
    "the mean visual extinction @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of grid zones along one edge of the box , @xmath64 is the visual extinction along the line of sight running parallel to the @xmath65-axis and with @xmath66 and @xmath28 coordinates @xmath67 , and where we sum over all sets of @xmath67 corresponding to zone centres .",
    "note that our choice to project along the @xmath65-axis is arbitrary , and that projecting along the @xmath66 or @xmath28 axes would yield the same value of @xmath61 , which indeed is simply given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the conversion factor between the column density of h nuclei and the visual extinction .",
    "this is given by @xmath70 for our choice of dust properties .",
    "to understand these results , first consider only the runs performed with our default values for @xmath41 and @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ mol - av]a shows that if we disregard the @xmath71  pc runs , then a clear correlation exists between @xmath48 and @xmath61 , with larger values of @xmath61 yielding larger values of @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , if we disregard the @xmath40 runs , then figure  [ mol - av]b shows that there is also a clear , and far stronger , correlation between @xmath49 and @xmath61 .",
    "if we compare the runs with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , then we see a factor of two to three change in @xmath48 , compared with a change in @xmath49 of three to four orders of magnitude .",
    "plotting @xmath48 and @xmath49 against the mean gas number density @xmath23 shows no clear correlation in either case ( figure  [ mol - n ] ) , if we consider the data as a whole , but also shows that both @xmath48 and @xmath49 correlate well with density at fixed metallicity , and with metallicity at fixed density .    at first glance",
    ", these results suggest that both the h@xmath4 and the co abundances are controlled by photodissociation , with the co responding far more strongly to changes in @xmath61 than the h@xmath4 . however , the results of the @xmath71  pc runs challenge this interpretation .",
    "they lie where we would expect in the plot of @xmath49 versus @xmath61 ( figure  [ mol - av]b ) , but they lie to the left of the corresponding @xmath74  pc runs in the plot of @xmath48 versus @xmath61 ( figure  [ mol - av]a ) .",
    "indeed , shifting them uniformly to the right by a factor of four brings them into good agreement with the other runs .",
    "this result can be understood if we realize that the real correlation responsible for the behaviour seen in figure  [ mol - av]a is not one between @xmath48 and @xmath61 , but is instead a correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath75 . since @xmath76",
    ", we find an apparent correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath61 if we compare only runs with the same box size @xmath41 .",
    "however , if we change @xmath41 without changing @xmath75 , we will still obtain the same value of @xmath48 , but find that it now corresponds to a different mean visual extinction .",
    "this result strongly suggests that the differences in the mean h@xmath4 abundance found at the end of the different runs are not a result of photodissociation , and that this plays little or no role in regulating the amount of h@xmath4 present in the gas .",
    "instead , the dependence of @xmath48 on @xmath75 suggests that the amount of h@xmath4 present depends simply on the h@xmath4 formation time , @xmath77 , which scales as @xmath78 . if @xmath75 is small , then the h@xmath4 formation time is long , and the hydrogen in the gas simply does not have sufficient time to become fully molecular by the end of the simulation , despite the boost to the h@xmath4 formation rate resulting from the presence of the turbulent compressions . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath75 is large , the hydrogen can easily become almost fully molecular .",
    "in contrast , the co abundances in these runs respond in the fashion that we would expect them to if they were primarily controlled by photodissociation .",
    "decreasing @xmath41 while holding @xmath75 constant leads to a sharp drop in the co abundance , implying that in this case the correlation with @xmath61 is real , and not simply a consequence of the relationship between @xmath75 and @xmath61 .",
    "we can confirm this interpretation by considering what happens in the runs that are performed with @xmath40 to eliminate all photodissociation .",
    "we see from figure  [ mol - av]a that in this case , we still recover the same correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath61 .",
    "however , in the absence of an ultraviolet background , the h@xmath4 abundance _ can not _",
    "depend on the visual extinction , as the only physical processes in the simulation that depend on the visual extinction are those involving the attenuation of the ultraviolet background .",
    "therefore , the correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath61 can not be real , and must simply be a consequence of the actual correlation of between @xmath48 and @xmath75 , or rather the inverse correlation between @xmath48 and the mean h@xmath4 formation time . on the other hand , figure",
    "[ mol - av]b shows that the co abundance at low @xmath61 is much larger in the runs without a uv background , consistent with a picture in which the co abundance is primarily controlled by photodissociation .",
    "figure  [ mol - av]b also demonstrates that the co abundance is not determined solely by photodissociation , since even in the absence of the uv background , we see a systematic decrease in the co abundance as we move to lower densities .",
    "this decrease is driven primarily by the decrease in the mean h@xmath4 abundance , since h@xmath4 is a key component in most of the chemical pathways capable of forming gas - phase co. we have verified this by running simulations similar to runs n30-uv0 and n100-uv0 that start with all of the hydrogen in molecular form .",
    "the co abundances produced in these runs are significantly higher than in the runs that start with atomic hydrogen : in the lower density run , roughly 60% of the available carbon is converted to co , while in the higher density run , roughly 95% is converted . in comparison ,",
    "the fraction of carbon converted to co in runs n30-uv0 and n100-uv0 is 13% and 60% , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from figure  [ mol - av]b that the dependence of the co abundance on the h@xmath4 abundance is a relatively small effect in comparison with the dependence of the co abundance on the mean visual extinction in the runs with a uv background : the former is responsible for changes in @xmath49 of a factor of a few , while the latter is responsible for changes of several orders of magnitude .",
    "we have thus arrived at the first key result of this paper : in a turbulent molecular cloud , the mean h@xmath4 abundance depends primarily on the time taken to form the h@xmath4 and is insensitive to photodissociation , while the co abundance is determined primarily by photodissociation , with only a secondary dependence on the h@xmath4 fraction .",
    "we can get further confirmation of the results of the previous section by considering the time dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in figure  [ mol_time_solar ]",
    ", we plot the evolution of these quantities as a function of time for a set of runs with different mean densities at solar metallicity , while in figure  [ mol_time_01 ] , we show a similar plot for runs with a metallicity @xmath79 . looking at the evolution of h@xmath4 fraction with time in these figures",
    ", we see that the time required to convert a large fraction of the initial atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen decreases as we increase the density or the metallicity , just as we would expect given the results of the previous section .",
    "moreover , it is clear that in most of the runs , the mean h@xmath4 fraction has yet to reach equilibrium at the end of the run . finally ,",
    "extrapolation of the curves beyond six myr suggests that the h@xmath4 fraction in all of the runs should eventually reach a value of order unity ; there is no indication that the equilibrium value of @xmath48 will be significantly smaller than one in any of the runs .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath49 in the different runs is qualitatively different from that of @xmath48 .",
    "co forms rapidly at the beginning of the simulations , but after roughly a million years , the rate of increase of the co abundance slows or stops .",
    "the amount of co formed during this initial period of rapid evolution depends strongly on the mean visual extinction of the gas , with the runs with low @xmath61 forming considerably less co than the runs with high @xmath61 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the co abundance depends on the value of @xmath48 at this point . if @xmath80 , as in runs n300 or n1000 , then there is little further evolution of the co abundance . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mean h@xmath4 abundance remains significantly smaller than unity at this early point , then the co abundance continues to increase , driven by the increasing availability of h@xmath4 , and may double or triple by the end of the run .",
    "it is also evident that @xmath49 displays far larger fluctuations in runs with low mean visual extinctions ( e.g. runs n30 or n100-z01 ) than in runs with high mean visual extinctions .",
    "this is a consequence of the difference in the spatial distribution of the co in a low extinction run compared to a high extinction run .",
    "when @xmath61 is small , the co fraction in most of the gas is very small , owing to the lack of effective shielding of the co against uv photodissociation . in this case , most of the co in the simulation is found in a small number of dense , comparatively well - shielded clumps . since our simulations were performed without self - gravity , these clumps are transient objects , and are continually being disrupted and reformed by the turbulence .",
    "this continual variation in the number and nature of the co - rich clumps leads to the observed variation in the mass - weighted mean co abundance . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath61 is large , far more of the gas has a high co fraction , and many more clumps and other dense structures such as sheets and filaments contribute to @xmath49 .",
    "although all of these structures are transient , just as in the low @xmath61 runs , the fact that a much larger number of structures contribute to @xmath49 than in the low @xmath61 runs means that the variation in @xmath49 resulting from the creation or destruction of any particular clump or filament is much smaller .    in figure",
    "[ mol_time_g0 ] , we show how @xmath48 and @xmath49 vary with time in runs n30-uv0 , n100-uv0 , n300-uv0 , and n1000-uv0 , all performed without an ultraviolet background .",
    "the evolution of the h@xmath4 fraction in these runs is very similar to that in the runs with a uv background , again showing that photodissociation plays little or no role in regulating the growth of the h@xmath4 abundance . on the other hand , the evolution of the co abundance in these runs is clearly different from that in the runs with a uv background .",
    "the increase in the co abundance in these runs more clearly tracks the increase in the h@xmath4 abundance , and there is no longer any significant feature at @xmath81 ( other than in run n1000-uv0 , which has converted almost all of its carbon into co by this point ) .",
    "the co abundances produced in the lower density runs are also clearly much larger than in the corresponding runs with a uv background , and there is no indication that they have yet reached equilibrium .",
    "finally , in figure  [ mol_time_long ] , we plot the time evolution of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the four runs that we evolved for a much longer time .",
    "this plot further emphasizes that time is the primary factor controlling the h@xmath4 abundance in the runs in which the product @xmath75 is small .",
    "for instance , at @xmath82 , the mass - weighted mean h@xmath4 fraction in run n100-z01 is only 10% , but it has increased to roughly 40% by @xmath83 , i.e.  it has increased almost linearly with time .",
    "the only one of these runs in which h@xmath4 photodissociation appears to play an important role is run n30-z01 , in which the mean h@xmath4 fraction appears to saturate at roughly 5% .",
    "the mean visual extinction of the gas in this run is only 0.1 magnitudes , while in run n100-z01 , which is not significantly affected by the uv , it is approximately 0.3 magnitudes , suggesting that the critical value below which uv photodissociation begins to significantly limit the h@xmath4 abundance lies somewhere in the range @xmath840.3 .",
    "this corresponds to a mean column density of hydrogen nuclei of @xmath85@xmath86 , which compares well with the finding by the _ copernicus _",
    "satellite that there is a sudden jump in the h@xmath4 abundance along galactic sightlines with @xmath87 , consistent with the onset of self - shielding @xcite .",
    "it also agrees within a factor of a few with the critical extinction @xmath88 derived by @xcite for idealized spherical clouds .",
    "it is of particular interest to understand how the distinct chemical changes we see as we decrease @xmath61 affect the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor , @xmath13 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath49 by almost four orders of magnitude between @xmath73 and @xmath72 , is suggestive of a strong correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath61 , but does not by itself allow us to quantify the relationship between these two quantities .",
    "the sharp decrease in @xmath49 as we decrease @xmath61 is reflected in a sharp decrease in the column density of co along most sightlines , as illustrated in figure  [ proj ] .",
    "this also suggests a strong correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath61 , but still does not allow us to make a quantitative statement .    to quantify the relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath61",
    ", we need to be able to at least approximately compute @xmath89 where @xmath9 is the velocity - integrated intensity of the @xmath10 line of @xmath7co .",
    "since we can easily measure @xmath11 along any desired line of sight through our simulations , the difficulty comes from the calculation of the integrated intensity .",
    "if the gas were optically thin in the @xmath90 line , then it would be trivial to compute @xmath9 , since the co emissivity at any point would depend only on the local values of the temperature , density and chemical abundances , and would be effectively decoupled from the conditions elsewhere in the cloud .",
    "unfortunately , in many of our simulations , some or all of the lines of sight are optically thick in the @xmath90 line , making it far more challenging to model the co emission accurately .",
    "when the gas is optically thick , it becomes necessary to account for line absorption , which can be ignored in the optically thin case .",
    "furthermore , the opacity and emissivity in the line at any one point in the cloud can couple to the opacity and emissivity at other points in the cloud .",
    "therefore , to model the co emission entirely accurately , it becomes necessary to calculate the opacities and emissivities for all points in the cloud simultaneously .",
    "this is typically accomplished through the use of an iterative method ( see e.g.  the review of techniques in * ? ? ?",
    "if the geometry of the gas is relatively simple ( e.g.  slab symmetry or spherical symmetry ) , then the resulting problem may still be solved without too much effort . in the present case ,",
    "however , the density , temperature , chemical composition and velocity structure of the gas are all highly inhomogeneous , and solution of the coupled equations is a complex and computationally intensive problem that lies outside of the scope of this initial study .",
    "if we are prepared to tolerate a certain amount of uncertainty , however , then it becomes possible to estimate the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor relatively easily , even in optically thick gas . to compute an estimate for the conversion factor , which we denote as @xmath91 to distinguish it from the true conversion factor @xmath13",
    ", we use the following procedure .",
    "we begin by selecting a set of independent lines of sight through our simulation results .",
    "we choose lines of sight that run parallel to the @xmath65-axis , one per resolution element .",
    "this choice is arbitrary ; a different orientation would yield similar results .",
    "we then compute h@xmath4 and co column densities along each of these lines of sight .",
    "we next convert each of the co column densities into an optical depth , @xmath92 , which represents an estimate of the optical depth of the gas in the co @xmath10 transition . to perform this conversion",
    ", we make three major simplifying assumptions .",
    "we assume that all of the co is in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , and that the gas is isothermal , with a temperature equal to the weighted mean temperature of the gas , where we use the co number density as an appropriate weighting function @xmath93 we also assume that the co linewidth @xmath94 is uniform , and is given by @xmath95 .",
    "our choice for @xmath94 is motivated by the fact that our simulations have an rms turbulent velocity of @xmath96 , and that we would expect the one - dimensional velocity dispersion to be a factor of @xmath97 smaller than this , i.e.  @xmath98 . given these assumptions , the relationship between @xmath99 and @xmath92 becomes @xcite @xmath100 \\frac{n_{\\rm co}}{\\delta v},\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the spontaneous radiative transition rate for the @xmath10 transition , @xmath102 is the frequency of the transition , @xmath103 is the corresponding energy , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the statistical weights of the @xmath106 and @xmath107 levels , respectively , and @xmath108 is the fractional level population of the @xmath106 level .",
    "we take values for @xmath101 and @xmath102 from the lamda database @xcite . in the case",
    "that @xmath109 , a typical temperature in the highly molecular gas in our simulations , this procedure yields @xmath110 , i.e.   in this case , a co column density of approximately @xmath111 corresponds to an optical depth @xmath112 .    to convert from @xmath92 to @xmath9",
    ", we use the same procedure as in the curve of growth analysis presented in @xcite .",
    "we write the integrated intensity as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the brightness temperature of the line , @xmath94 is the linewidth , and @xmath115 is the photon escape probability .",
    "we approximate @xmath115 by assuming that it is the same as for a plane - parallel , uniform slab @xcite : @xmath116 / 4.68 \\tau & \\tau \\leq 7 , \\\\ \\left(4\\tau \\left[\\ln",
    "\\left(\\tau / \\sqrt{\\pi } \\right ) \\right]^{1/2 } \\right)^{-1 } & \\tau > 7 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{beta}\\ ] ] finally , since we have previously assumed that the co is in lte , we simply set @xmath117 .    using equations  [ wco ] and [ beta ] , we can compute the integrated intensity for each of our lines of sight . since we already know the h@xmath4 column density along each line of sight , we could in principle associate a co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor with each one . however , as the size of each individual zone in one of our simulations is much smaller than the spatial resolution of observations of all but the few closest gmcs , we feel it leads to a more meaningful value for @xmath91 if we average over the whole cloud , since this is essentially what the limited resolution of the observations forces us to do observationally .",
    "we therefore average over all lines of sight to compute a mean intensity @xmath118 for the datacube as a whole .",
    "similarly , we compute a mean h@xmath4 column density for the datacube , @xmath119 , by averaging over all lines of sight . our estimate of the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor is then simply the ratio of these two quantities : @xmath120    using this procedure , we have computed this estimated co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor for each of our simulations , and have plotted the resulting values against @xmath61 in figure  [ xfact][xfact - g0 ] . in figure",
    "[ xfact ] , we show the results from all of our runs with non - zero uv backgrounds . in figure",
    "[ xfact - g0 ] , we compare our results from the runs no uv with those from the corresponding runs with uv .",
    "the canonical value of @xmath13 for the milky way , @xmath121 @xcite is indicated in both figures by a horizontal dashed line .",
    "the first point to note from figure  [ xfact ] is that for our solar metallicity runs with @xmath122 , or in other words , for simulations with parameters that are a reasonable match to the properties of local gmcs , we find remarkably good agreement between our estimated conversion factor and the measured value .",
    "this level of agreement is probably fortuitous to some degree , given the uncertainty in the observational value and the larger uncertainties in our estimated values .",
    "nevertheless , it does indicate that despite our simplifications , our estimates do seem to be successfully capturing the basic physics and are probably trustworthy to within a factor of a few .",
    "a second important point to note from figure  [ xfact ] is that for any given @xmath61 , the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor shows little dependence on metallicity  changes to @xmath17 of an order of magnitude or more alter @xmath91 by at most a factor of a few .",
    "it is therefore not true to say that @xmath13 has a strong dependence on metallicity .",
    "instead , figure  [ xfact ] demonstrates that the true dependence is on the mean extinction @xmath61 . for @xmath123",
    ", there is no clear correlation between @xmath91 and @xmath61 , but at @xmath124 , we see a strong correlation . the dependence of @xmath91 on @xmath61 can be described with the following , wholly empirical fitting function , indicated in figure  [ xfact ] by the dotted line : @xmath125 where @xmath91 has its standard units of @xmath126 .",
    "this empirical fitting function is accurate to within a factor of a few over the whole range of @xmath61 and @xmath91 considered in the figure .    of course",
    ", if we consider clouds with a fixed density and size , and merely vary the metallicity , then the strong dependence of @xmath91 on the mean extinction implies a strong metallicity dependence , since @xmath61 is proportional to metallicity . on the other hand ,",
    "if we vary the metallicity but also allow the mean density or the size of the cloud to vary to compensate , then we will find little or no metallicity dependence .",
    "figure  [ xfact - g0 ] demonstrates the importance of uv photodissociation for producing the galactic co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor . in the absence of uv photodissociation",
    ", we get comparable values of @xmath91 for our @xmath127 and @xmath128 runs , as one would expect , given that most of the gas in these runs is well shielded from whatever uv is present , but we find significantly smaller values for @xmath91 at lower mean extinctions .",
    "it is also of interest to plot the mean values of @xmath9 for the various runs , as this gives a good indication of which of our simulations would correspond to co - bright clouds , from which it would be easy to detect co emission , and which would produce co - faint clouds that would be difficult or impossible to detect in co. in figure  [ mean - wco ] , we therefore plot @xmath129 against @xmath61 for each of our simulations . given that the noise level for observations of co in local group galaxies is typically of the order of @xmath130 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is clear that only the runs with @xmath131 will produce co - bright clouds ; runs with lower @xmath61 will produce clouds that would be extremely difficult to detect with co observations .",
    "moreover , of the runs with @xmath132 , only runs n1000-z003 and n300-z01 produce detectable co : the higher metallicity , lower density runs with @xmath132 yield co integrated intensities that would be undetectable .",
    "finally , it is interesting to speculate how our results for @xmath13 would be affected if we were to consider stronger uv field strengths . in clouds with a high mean extinction",
    ", we would not expect the increased uv to have much effect . in these runs ,",
    "most of the co is situated in gas that is already well shielded from the uv background , and even relatively large changes in the strength of the background will not lead to co photodissociation becoming important in these regions . on the other hand , in runs with low mean extinction , that have most of their co in gas that is not particularly well shielded from the uv background , a change in the strength of the background will have a much stronger effect .",
    "we would therefore expect the values we obtain for @xmath13 in the @xmath123 runs to have little sensitivity to the uv background field strength , and the values we obtain in the @xmath124 runs to increase significantly with increasing uv field strength , leading to a steepening of the relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath61 .",
    "we plan to test this prediction in future work .",
    "we can draw a number of immediate conclusions from the results that we have presented in the previous section .",
    "first , it seems plain that when we talk about the formation of a molecular cloud , we should draw a distinction between the formation of a cloud in which the hydrogen is primarily in molecular form and the formation of a cloud from which co emission can readily be detected , since the conditions for the former are not the same as those for the latter .    to form an h@xmath4-dominated cloud",
    ", the cloud must have a mean visual extinction of a few tenths of a magnitude ( cf .",
    "@xcite , who find a critical value of approximately 0.5 for a spherical molecular cloud ) .",
    "more importantly , however , the cloud must survive for long enough to convert most of its atomic hydrogen into h@xmath4 .",
    "the time required is a strong function of @xmath75 , the product of the mean density of the cloud and its metallicity , although the dependence is not linear , and the time required also depends upon the strength and nature of the turbulence ( @xcite ; milosavljevic et al . , in prep . )    on the other hand , to make a co - bright cloud , we need a significantly higher mean extinction , @xmath123 , but do not require so much time , since the co abundance in most of the gas comes into equilibrium within 12  myr . in practice , given plausible cloud sizes , clouds that have a high enough mean extinction to be co - bright will also be dense enough to form h@xmath4 relatively quickly , but the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "second , the existence of a visual extinction threshold above which clouds become co - bright provides a simple explanation for the observation that in low metallicity systems cloud masses derived from co observations are significantly smaller than those derived from techniques that do not depend on co , such as infrared emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these systems ,",
    "the co largely traces the regions of a cloud ( or cloud complex ) that have mean extinctions greater than 2 , but does not trace the h@xmath4 in the surrounding envelope , which may be considerably more extensive and may contain a large fraction of the total mass of the cloud .",
    "third , the fact that the co fraction typically reaches equilibrium on a timescale comparable to or shorter than the crossing time of the cloud , and significantly shorter than the time required to assemble the cloud from warm atomic gas implies that co emission will `` switch - on '' rapidly during the assembly of the cloud , as hypothesized by @xcite . in the time it takes compressive flows or gravity to double or triple the mean extinction of a cloud with @xmath132 its",
    "co content and luminosity can increase more than a hundredfold .",
    "the cloud will therefore quickly move from being effectively unobservable in co to being readily observable .    on the other hand",
    ", the long h@xmath4 formation timescale implies that molecular clouds need not have equilibrium h@xmath4 abundances , even once they become co - bright , contrary to what is often assumed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "how far from equilibrium the h@xmath4 fractions are will depend on the cloud properties ( mean density , metallicity , rms turbulent velocity , etc . ) , the age of the cloud , and also on the range of densities considered within the cloud , since overdense regions will reach equilibrium much faster than underdense regions .",
    "fourth , we would expect the molecular clouds ( or regions thereof ) in low metallicity systems that we observe to be co - bright to also be systematically larger and/or denser than their counterparts in the milky way .",
    "this conclusion follows from the fact that if @xmath123 is required for co to form , and we decrease @xmath17 , then we must increase either @xmath23 or @xmath41 to compensate , since @xmath133 .",
    "this conclusion also lends itself to a relatively simple observational test .",
    "if we observe a giant molecular cloud of size @xmath41 in a low metallicity system ( where @xmath41 is the total size of the cloud , not of the co - bright region ) , and compare it with a cloud of a similar size in the milky way , then the former should be systematically denser than the latter .",
    "this systematic difference in density may be detectable by examination of the co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) or co(3 - 2)/co(1 - 0 ) line ratios , or the ratio of of hcn emission to co emission , all of which will be larger in denser systems .",
    "finally , our results also suggest a relatively simple explanation for the fact that gmcs observed in the milky way span only a small range in column densities @xcite .",
    "the requirement that @xmath123 for a co - bright cloud implies that any cloud identified as a gmc must have a minimum mean column density of around @xmath134 , since clouds with lower column densities will typically not contain much co.    the distribution of the mean column densities of gmcs above this minimum value depends upon the distributions of the size and mean density of the clouds .",
    "however , the cloud size distribution is typically found to be a sharply decreasing function of cloud size @xmath41 .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath135 for gmcs in the outer galaxy . if the mean density of the gmcs spans only a small range of values , then the distribution of column densities @xmath136 will be a sharply decreasing function of @xmath137 .",
    "if we combine this fact with the existence of a minimum column density threshold for a co - bright gmc , then it implies that most observed gmcs will have column densities that are close to the threshold .",
    "this argument relies on the mean cloud density not being a strong function of the size of the cloud .",
    "it is possible to show that this is a good assumption for at least the @xcite cloud sample . given a cloud size distribution @xmath138 , and a constant cloud mean density , then the cloud mass distribution is simply @xmath139 where we have assumed only that @xmath140 , consistent with our adoption of a constant cloud mean density . for comparison ,",
    "the cloud mass distribution inferred by @xcite for this sample of clouds was @xmath141 , demonstrating that even if the mean density of the clouds is not constant , it can at most be a very weak function of cloud size @xmath41 .",
    "if this argument is correct , it suggests that most galactic gmcs should have column densities close to @xmath142 .",
    "this value is a factor of three smaller than the value of @xmath143 determined by @xcite that is often taken to be canonical , but is in good agreement with the value recently derived by @xcite from their re - examination of the @xcite clouds using new data from the boston university - fcrao galactic ring survey .",
    "we note in conclusion that this argument makes no assumptions about the dynamical equilibrium of the clouds .",
    "this casts doubt on the frequently - made assumption that the small scatter in observed gmc column densities implies that the gmcs are in virial equilibrium .",
    "there are several caveats that should be borne in mind when considering our results . in our simulations",
    ", we use a simplified chemical network for modelling the formation of h@xmath4 and co , and adopt an approximate treatment of the effects of the ultraviolet background radiation field . when modelling the co integrated intensity , @xmath9 , we make additional approximations , such as the assumption that all of the co is in lte , or that the co linewidth has a fixed value .",
    "finally , our simulations neglect the effects of self - gravity , which is clearly important in real molecular clouds .    however , we are confident that these issues will not significantly affect our major results . in paper",
    "i , we showed that our simplified chemical model produces results that agree excellently with the standard umist astrochemical model @xcite over a wide range of parameter space , provided that h , he , c and o are the only elements considered . including other elements in the chemical model , such as sulphur , will worsen the agreement slightly , particularly in regions dominated by c and c@xmath144 , but is unlikely to result in large changes in either the mean abundance of co or the co integrated intensity .",
    "our simplified treatment of the effects of uv photodissociation will also introduce some error into our predicted co abundances . because the dense gas in a molecular cloud has a relatively small volume filling factor",
    ", we can be reasonably confident that our six - ray treatment of the radiation field will tend to overestimate its strength , as it will be more likely to miss shielding coming from dense regions that do not lie on lines of sight parallel to the coordinate axes , than to overestimate the effectiveness of the shielding provided by dense regions that do lie along these lines of sight .",
    "however , the main contribution to the photodissociation rate in any particular zone will come from the lines of sight with the lowest column densities . therefore ,",
    "if the lines of sight that run parallel to the coordinate axes have low column densities , the fact that we miss the shielding from a few dense regions that do not lie along these lines of sight will not substantially alter the predicted photodissociation rates .",
    "the approximations that we have made in order to derive @xmath9 are another potential source of error .",
    "observationally , we know that not all of the co in molecular clouds is in lte @xcite , and so our assumption that it is will cause us to overestimate the integrated intensity .",
    "our assumption that all of the co has the same temperature is another source of error , although we have attempted to mitigate this by adopting a suitably - weighted mean temperature for the gas that gives rise to the co emission .",
    "our adoption of a fixed linewidth for the co is also unrealistic : in reality , co in lower metallicity or lower density systems will be distributed more intermittently , and so can be expected to have a lower velocity dispersion than the gas as a whole .",
    "however , none of these sources of error will result in a large change in @xmath9 , and moreover they will offset each other to some degree .    finally , our neglect of the effects of self - gravity is important if one is concerned with the structure of the cloud on the scales of individual dense clumps ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the quantities that we have been dealing with in this paper are the results of averaging over the whole cloud , and changes in the cloud structure on scales of a few tenths of a parsec are unlikely to significantly affect these cloud - averaged values .",
    "nevertheless , this is an issue that we intend to return to in the future .",
    "we finish our discussion here by summarizing the key results of this paper .",
    "we have shown that the h@xmath4 abundance in turbulent molecular clouds is controlled primarily by the time taken to form the h@xmath4 , and that it is relatively insensitive to the effects of uv photodissociation .",
    "photodissociation becomes significant for determining the h@xmath4 abundance only below a visual extinction threshold of a few tenths of a magnitude , in good agreement with previous observational and theoretical work . on the other hand , co forms rapidly , but is strongly affected by photodissociation .",
    "the mean co abundance falls off rapidly with decreasing mean extinction , particularly in clouds with @xmath124 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the co - to - h@xmath4 conversion factor is also determined primarily by the mean extinction of the cloud , and that it is almost constant for @xmath123 , but falls off as @xmath145 for @xmath124 .",
    "furthermore , only the clouds with visual extinctions greater than a few have sufficiently large co integrated intensities to be detected by current observations .",
    "this therefore suggests a simple explanation for the discrepancy observed in low metallicity systems between cloud masses determined by co observations and those determined by non - co tracers , such as ir emission .",
    "co observations inevitably select co - bright clouds that have mean extinctions large enough to place them in the regime where @xmath13 is approximately constant and equal to the galactic value . on the other hand , observations that do not rely on co have no such bias and so select clouds that lie on the power - law portion of the relationship .",
    "therefore , co observations find an @xmath13 that does not vary significantly with metallicity , while other observations find a strong dependence on metallicity .",
    "finally , we have shown that if we combine the requirement that @xmath123 for a co - bright cloud with the observational fact that the gmc size distribution is a steeply decreasing function of size , then we are lead quite naturally to the prediction that all gmcs should have near - constant column densities . therefore",
    ", contrary to what is often assumed , the small scatter in observed gmc column densities does not necessarily imply that the gmcs are in virial equilibrium .",
