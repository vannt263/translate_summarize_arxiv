    "the search of new gauge interactions has been of great interest .",
    "such efforts help us understand whether there is any other new force in nature and how it fits to the grand picture of particle physics . if found , there is also a possibility that the new force carrier provides a portal between the standard model ( sm ) visible sector and a hidden sector involving new dynamics and matter contents .    in the simplest scenario ,",
    "such a new vector boson may have an origin from some extra @xmath4 gauge symmetry , under which some particles in both visible and hidden sectors are charged .",
    "it may even have kinetic or mass mixing with the sm photon or @xmath5 boson field to facilitate the mediation .",
    "after its symmetry breaking , as is often assumed , the @xmath4 gauge boson acquires a mass and is commonly called the @xmath6 boson if it is heavier than the electroweak scale or the dark photon if it is lighter .",
    "there have been a vast amount of studies on the neutral gauge boson over the years  @xcite . for example , recent direct searches at the lhc have already pushed the lower bound on the sequential @xmath6 mass to about 3  tev  @xcite .",
    "further investigations rely on advances in the colliding energy and beam luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , probes of the dark photon of mass below sub - gev have been done using nuclear transitions  @xcite or from its effects on the magnetic dipole moment of electron and/or muon  @xcite .",
    "the dark photon can be radiated off from some particle by bremsstrahlung and then decay into a pair of leptons in the fixed - target and beam - dump experiments  @xcite . with an appropriate coupling , it can be produced at @xmath7 colliders as well .",
    "if the dark photon couples to quarks , one can consider its production in meson decays , if kinematically allowed .",
    "recently , there is an elevated interest in the study of dark photon because of an experimental anomaly involved in isoscalar @xmath3be transitions reported by krasznahorkay et .",
    "al .  @xcite . in the transition from an excited state to the ground state ,",
    "the nucleus emitted an electron - positron pair whose open angle and invariant mass were found to deviate from the sm expectation of internal pair creation ( ipc ) by @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown that the distributions of open angle and invariant mass could be well fit by introducing a new particle with mass 16.7  mev produced in the transition . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors claimed that the new particle could be a vector boson @xmath9 and provided the preferred ranges of its couplings with sm particles that were consistent with current dark photon search constraints .",
    "there are several analyses on how to further test the model in ref .",
    "@xcite using low - energy physical processes  @xcite , as well as proposals of alternative models for the @xmath3be anomaly  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose to use rare leptonic decays of kaon and pion , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as felicitous means to probe the light dark photon in the mass range of about @xmath1  mev , particularly in view of the putative gauge boson @xmath9 with vectorial couplings mentioned above .",
    "this is because the final - state electron - positron pair production can be enhanced via the mediation of the @xmath9 boson over the sm background through a virtual photon .",
    "we show that the sm background and the signal have very different spectra in the @xmath7 invariant mass : the sm background has a continuous spectrum , whereas the decay through a dark photon features in a sharp resonance peak around the dark photon mass @xmath12 . moreover , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 decays are able to probe most part of the preferred coupling space inferred from the @xmath3be anomaly , assuming specific production rates of kaons / pions and their energy resolutions .",
    "we provide the projected experimental limits on the dark photon couplings based on these decay processes .",
    "we show that the signal events and sm background events have different behaviours in the @xmath15 angular distribution in the leptonic kaon decay .",
    "we also discuss the influence of the kaon / pion structure dependence ( i.e. , the form factors ) , and find their effects almost irrelevant in current considerations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : x ] , we review the leptonic meson decays of interest to us .",
    "we present their decay amplitudes , including both inner bremsstrahlung and structure - dependent parts , and provide the form factors involved in the latter part . in section  [ sec : scen ] , we consider three different dark photon scenarios , depending on how it couples to the sm particles , and three different experimental schemes for the kaon and pion decays .",
    "we estimate the projected reach in the dark photon couplings in section  [ sec : proj ] .",
    "numerical results are presented in section  [ sec : resu ] , where we also discuss effects coming from the structure - dependent contributions .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "there can be many different ways to realize a light @xmath4 gauge boson and let it couple with sm particles ( directly or via mixing with the photon and/or @xmath5 boson ) . in the following",
    ", we will keep the formalism as general as possible , without explicitly referring to any particular new physics model .",

    "to explain the @xmath70 anomaly , it is sufficient for the dark photon to have couplings with only fermions in the first family while satisfying gauge anomaly cancellation  @xcite .",
    "the preferred ranges of dark photon couplings are found to be  @xcite @xmath71 decays measured at the na48/2 experiment .    if the dark photon also couples to the second family and we require gauge anomaly cancellation within each family , then the @xmath4 charges for muon and strange quark have either @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
