    "non - fickian ( anomalous ) transport is a widespread feature of contaminant migration in porous media  @xcite . specifically , ` non - fickian ' means that the spread of the transported species grows nonlinearly in time , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , the resulting concentration profiles displaying a non - gaussian behavior  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the linear spread and gaussian shapes usually expected for particles migration in perfectly homogeneous media , where the fickian advection - dispersion equation applies : see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein . a broad spectrum of physical reasons",
    "have been invoked to explain the observed deviations from gaussianity .",
    "for instance , the homogeneity hypothesis becomes questionable in presence of irregularities at multiple space scales  @xcite , complex structures of flow streams  @xcite and saturation distribution within the medium  @xcite , and physico - chemical exchanges of the pollutant particles with the surrounding material  @xcite .",
    "another important source of non - fickian behaviors is the collective motion of pollutants due to reciprocal interactions .",
    "a well - known example is provided by reactive transport , where two or more chemical species may combine ( reversibly or irreversibly ) to give birth to new ones .",
    "even in homogeneous media , this may lead to intricate contaminant patterns  @xcite , whose complexity could be further increased by the presence of spatial heterogeneities  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the dynamics of concentrated particles will also display nonlinear , collective phenomena .",
    "indeed , the motion of a single pollutant parcel depends on the density of the surrounding fluid , which in turn is affected by the number of such parcels nearby , so that the microscopic trajectories are correlated .",
    "transport of dense pollutant plumes has been long investigated , yet keeps raising many conceptual as well as practical issues  @xcite .",
    "studies cover both homogeneous saturated and heterogenous unsaturated materials  @xcite : extensive reviews may be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "strong density gradients are encountered when either the contaminant itself is highly concentrated at the source , or the plume flows through regions that are rich in salt ; in particular , this latter case might become a major concern for radioactive waste disposal near salt domes  @xcite .",
    "similarly as brownian motion is related to the diffusion equation , concentration - dependent particles paths can be formally shown to lead to a family of nonlinear fokker - planck transport equations , on the grounds of a statistical - mechanical approach ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a detailed account of recent advances .",
    "the displacements of a particle in the medium are thought to be affected by the number of other particles in its initial or final position , or both  @xcite : this allows better understanding the small - scale dynamics , rather than imposing the macroscopic equations on a phenomenological basis  @xcite .    adopting a somewhat similar perspective ,",
    "we propose here a simple model for the collective concentration - dependent dynamics of a dense contaminant plume and explore its qualitative behavior by resorting to monte carlo simulation .",
    "model predictions are then validated on experimental data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model ] , we develop a stochastic equation that describes the motion of a pollutant parcel in a dense fluid . in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss the qualitative behavior of the model and the interplay of its components",
    ". then , in section  [ comparison ] we proceed to compare model outcomes to experimental results of variable - density contaminant transport in saturated homogeneous porous columns .",
    "finally , the potentialities and the limits of the proposed approach are evidenced in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider a vertical column filled with sand . for sake of simplicity , we start by assuming that the sand is uniformly packed and well - mixed , so that the porous medium can be considered as homogeneous , and that the column is fully saturated in water .",
    "when the ratio between the length and the diameter of the column ( the so - called aspect ratio ) is much greater than one , the system can be regarded as one - dimensional , to a first approximation .",
    "suppose now that a given amount of contaminant fluid is injected into the column : we can conceptually represent the pollutant plume as a collection of fluid parcels @xmath2 , each containing a fraction @xmath3 of the total contaminant mass @xmath4 .",
    "when the effects of molecular diffusion are negligible , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath5 will not change in the course of plume evolution  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is the reference volume of the injected pollutant , each parcel carries a volume @xmath7 .",
    "= 9.0 cm    the projections of forces acting on a parcel @xmath8 in the direction of the flow are : the pressure gradient imposed by the injecting pump , @xmath9 , supposedly constant ; the viscous resistence which opposes flow , namely @xmath10 , where the friction coefficient @xmath11 is given by the ratio of the fluid dynamic viscosity @xmath12 [ kg / m s ] and the medium permeability @xmath13 [ m@xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the local velocity of a parcel ; gravity and buoyancy , which can be written as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gravity acceleration , @xmath18 is the density of the contaminant parcel and @xmath19 is the density of the fluid surrounding the parcel @xmath8 .",
    "mechanical dispersion can be taken into account by adding stochastic fluctuations @xmath20 around the parcel velocity @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "it is customary to assume @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ensemble average of the particles velocities ( provided that the medium is sufficiently homogeneous  @xcite ) and @xmath23 is an uncorrelated white noise with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the constant of proportionality determines the strength of the velocity fluctuations and is thus related to the dispersivity @xmath24 [ m ] of the porous material .",
    "then , the forces balance reads @xmath25 where the reference axes system is chosen so that gravity is positive pointing downwards and the explicit dependence on time has been omitted .",
    "it appears that the absolute value of the pollutant density does not play a major role , the plume migration being mostly controlled by relative density differences : this is coherent with experimental evidences  @xcite .",
    "= 9.0 cm    let us now focus on the two terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the density of a contaminant parcel can be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass of reference fluid ( e.g. , water ) contained in @xmath28 and @xmath29 its density . by resorting to the definitions of @xmath5 and @xmath28",
    ", we obtain @xmath30 where finally @xmath31 is given by the product of the molar concentration @xmath32 [ mol / l ] times the molar mass [ g / mol ] of the injected species .",
    "even modest density differences with respect to the resident fluid ( of the order of a few percents ) might sensibly affect the contaminant dynamics  @xcite .",
    "hence , we focus on this case and think of @xmath18 as a small perturbation compared to @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath33 . as for the local fluid density @xmath19 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the pollutant mass contained in an elementary volume @xmath36 around the position @xmath37 of the parcel @xmath8 .",
    "we are assuming that each parcel is aware of the presence of the others only at short range , through the effects of local density variations . since @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of pollutant parcels in @xmath40 $ ] at time @xmath41 , we can finally rewrite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a dimensionless normalization factor such that @xmath44 . in practice",
    ", @xmath43 expresses the ( arbitrary , but sufficiently large ) number of contaminant parcels that are initially attributed to each @xmath36 to represent the average density @xmath31 at injection . at each time step , the quantity @xmath45 identifies the contaminant concentration at position @xmath37 .",
    "= 9.0 cm    = 9.0 cm    the role of viscosity has been condensed in the constant parameter @xmath46 . in reality , viscosity depends on contaminant concentration , but its variations are frequently less relevant than those of density and are thus neglected  @xcite . within the proposed formulation , including a functional dependence of the kind @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the reference value in the fluid and @xmath49 is a ( small ) constant , would be straightforward . in the following , however , we always suppose that @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , we do not address the possible dependence of density and viscosity on other physical variables , such as temperature .    finally , assuming that inertial effects can be neglected ( which is the case , provided that viscous forces are dominant ) , and making use of expressions  [ exp1 ] and  [ rho_n ] , we can rewrite eq .",

    "this is the case when dispersion dominates , so that fluid parcels are rapidly dragged far apart and can hardly interact .",
    "eventually , at longer time scales , dispersion will usually overcome the effects due to concentration .",

    "correspond to choosing a poisson pdf @xmath67 , so that a single time - scale , e.g. , the average @xmath68 of the distribution , dominates  @xcite . as for the displacements , the spatial scales of advection and dispersion in the ctrw are determined by the cumulants @xmath69 of the jump lengths distribution @xmath66 and are not separated _ a priori _",
    "a common choice is to adopt a gaussian pdf @xmath66 , so that the first two cumulants are sufficient to characterize transport : in particular , @xmath70 is associated to advection and @xmath71 to dispersion .",

    "the process defined by  [ mc1 ] and  [ mc2 ] can be easily simulated by monte carlo method .",
    "note however that the jump lengths distribution @xmath76 explicitly depends on concentration , so that particles trajectories are not independent and mutual interactions require knowing the concentration field ( i.e. , the locations of the entire ensemble ) before updating walkers positions . starting from a known initial condition @xmath77 ,",
    "particles are displaced at each time step by drawing waiting times and jump lengths from  [ mc1 ] and  [ mc2 ] , respectively , and the new concentration field is recursively determined for the following time step .",
    "walkers whose random waiting time is longer than the current time step stay in the same spatial site . for continuous contaminant spills , new particles are added at the column entrance for the duration of the injection . in order to attain convergence in simulations , we could either @xmath78 choose very small time steps for updating displacements and concentration field , or @xmath79 at each ( larger ) time step iteratevely compute the values of displacements and concentration until their relative error is below a given threshold .",
    "after testing both methods , we found convenient to resort to the former : the optimal value of the time step was determined by trial - and - error .",
    "monte carlo simulation offers an expedient means of exploring the qualitative features of the nonlinear ctrw transport model described above .",
    "in particular , we proceed now to analyze spatial contaminant concentration profiles ( at fixed time ) for small values of the parameter @xmath80 ; this allow getting insights on the relevance of the coupling between velocity and concentration .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] compares a fickian contaminant profile , corresponding to @xmath81 , with typical spatial profiles for concentration - dependent transport ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "downwards injection gives rise to positively skewed profiles , while the opposite is true for upwards injection . in all cases",
    ", we considered a step injection of finite duration .",
    "nonlinear transport clearly displays asymmetric profiles , whereas fickian transport corresponds to gaussian ( symmetric ) profiles .",
    "= 9.0 cm    = 9.0 cm    the time duration of the contaminant injection is a key factor in determining the spatial shape of the plume .",
    "indeed , the coupling between concentration and velocity is in competition with dispersion , which in turn is induced by the average velocity @xmath83 .",
    "the stronger the velocity @xmath84 , the lesser is the relevance of the nonlinear term in @xmath85 .",
    "the injected plume might have such a limited extension that dispersion rapidly dominates concentration - dependent effects : in other words , because of their velocity , fluid parcels become quickly dispersed , and their interactions through the density field are weak .",
    "this prediction is coherent with our experimental measures : increasing the imposed flux ( at fixed @xmath32 ) , the contaminant profiles approach standard fickian shapes . at the opposite , the longer the extension of the injected plume and the more persistent are the effects of the reciprocal interactions , before eventually dispersion takes over .",
    "this phenomenon has already been experimentally detected for the case of viscosity - dependent transport of ` slices ' of finite duration  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a given value of @xmath80 , the relevance of the nonlinear coupling is stronger for small velocity fields @xmath84 and long injection times .    on the basis of the observations above",
    ", one might expect that the effects of the nonlinear coupling would come into play mainly through velocity variations .",
    "actually , it turns out that the average particle velocity @xmath86 is only slightly affected by density , provided that @xmath80 is not too large . on the other hand , fluctuations around the mean velocity ( induced by the nonlinear terms )",
    "do not simply average out , and contribute instead to an apparent plume dispersion ( in addition to @xmath87 ) .",
    "this is a relevant and subtle outcome , which is ultimately responsible for the skewed shape of the pollutant profiles , the concentration - dependent contribution to dispersion being proportional to density differences ( and thus non - symmetric ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we display the behavior of the contaminant variance @xmath88 as a function of time , as computed by monte carlo simulation . for the case of fickian transport ( @xmath80=0 ) , the variance is a straight line , as expected . for concentration - dependent transport ,",
    "the variance turns out to be a nonlinear function of time and appreciably deviates from the fickian behavior .",
    "this is indeed the hallmark of anomalous diffusion . on the contrary",
    ", the average of the contaminant plume ( not shown here ) is found to be linear in time , for small values of @xmath80 .",
    "= 9.0 cm    while in the present discussion we have made the assumption of considering flows in homogeneous porous media , which amounts to drawing waiting times from a poisson pdf , the ctrw framework straightforwardly allows taking into account spatial heterogeneities , due , e.g. , to different grain sizes or variable saturation .",
    "the broad velocities spectra that are commonly found in heterogeneous and/or unsaturated materials are mirrored in a broad distribution of time scales for the jumping rates between sites : it is customary to incorporate such physical processes in @xmath67 by considering power - law waiting times between consecutive displacements , possibly with an exponential cut - off  @xcite",
    ". particles trajectories would then be affected on one hand by concentration - dependent displacements and on the other hand by anomalously long sojourns : the two processes may superpose , depending on the respective time scales . the qualitative behavior of the competition between density effects and heterogeneities is displayed in figs .",

    "in this section , we test the proposed random walk model on some experimental measurements of dense contaminant transport obtained at the physical - chemistry department ( dpc ) , cea / saclay . the experimental device , named beeti , consists of a dichromatic x - ray source ( @xmath90 kev , @xmath91 kev ) , applied to a vertical column of height @xmath92 cm and diameter @xmath93 cm ( the aspect ratio is therefore @xmath94 ) .",

    "however , this hypothesis is in contrast with two basic facts : first , adopting a power - law waiting time pdf is somehow unjustified , since the medium is homogeneous ; second , a standard linear ctrw approach could not explain why the asymmetry of the breakthrough curves is affected by the flow direction .",

    "we have proposed a nonlinear random walk approach to the modelling of variable - density contaminant flows in porous media , within a ctrw framework .",

    "it is possible to describe transport through both homogeneous and heterogeneous materials : in this latter case , we have shown that the effects of concentration - dependent dynamics are in competition with ( and might partially hidden by ) those of spatial heterogeneities .",
    "the proposed random walk model is admittedly simple , since the full spectrum of interactions that actually take place between the velocity and density fields has been condensed in a single nonlinear coupling at the scale of particles trajectories .",
    "detailed studies show that the physics behind variable - density transport is essentially @xmath130 , or at least @xmath131 , because of the complex interfacial dynamics between two fluids of different densities and/or viscosities  @xcite .",
    "neglecting these phenomena leads to descriptions that must be necessarily intended in a mean - field sense : only the coarse - scale behavior of the real system can be captured , and the fine - scale details are averaged out  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have made the hypothesis that molecular diffusion is negligible with respect to mechanical dispersion , and that viscosity can be considered as constant , to a first approximation .    yet",
    ", our random walk model compares well to a set of dense contaminant transport measurements realized by means of the beeti device .",
    "the experimental conditions ensure that most of the introduced simplifications actually apply : the aspect ratio of the column is large , so that migration is almost @xmath132 ; viscosity variations are weaker than density variations ; molecular diffusion is smaller than dispersion .",
    "it seems reasonable to think that the limits of validity of the proposed model will clearly emerge when these hypotheses are not verified : experimental activities are ongoing and will be presented in a forthcoming work . in particular",
    ", we expect our model to provide a satisfactory agreement with measured data when it is possible to consider density variations as small perturbations with respect to the resident fluid ( i.e. , @xmath133 ) . for larger density differences , other",
    ", more complex couplings should perhaps be introduced , possibly involving higher - order nonlinearities and long - range correlations .",
    "the findings in  @xcite , for instance , suggest that in presence of relevant density gradients even the validity of fick and darcy laws at microscopic scale should be carefully reconsidered . in this respect ,",
    "monte carlo simulation might be complemented , e.g. , by the promising computational tool of smoothed particle hydrodynamics , which has been recently applied with success to the numerical study of variable - density flows with stochastic dispersion  @xcite .",
    "the proposed random walk approach has been motivated by a specific problem in contaminant migration ; many other physical processes where the ctrw formalism applies may exhibit particles paths correlated via the density field , so that relevant advances would be achieved by formally generalizing the ctrw theory for the case of concentration - dependent distributions .",
