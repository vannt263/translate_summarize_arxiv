    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs mechanism provides masses to fundamental particles via electroweak symmetry breaking , which requires the existence of a scalar , neutral particle : the higgs boson . however , several open issues of sm , such as the fine tuning required to keep the quadratic radiative correction to the higgs boson mass under control ( hierarchy problem ) , suggest extensions of the sm . in many sm extensions , such as the supersymmetric model ( susy ) , the left - right symmetric model , and the little higgs model",
