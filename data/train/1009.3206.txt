    "one of the current topics in solid - state magnetism is multiple - spin ordering without any single - spin dipole moment.@xcite vector and scalar chiral orders and spin multipolar orders are typical examples expected to appear in real compounds .",
    "the emergence of vector and scalar chiralities accompanies the spontaneous breakdown of parity or time - reversal symmetries and these two could be detected indirectly from parity- or time - reversal - odd observables and related quantities ( e.g. , electric polarization in multiferroics , asymmetric momentum dependence of spin structure factors , hall conductivity , etc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "spin multipolar orders , for example , spin nematic and spin triatic orders , in spin-@xmath1 magnets can occur without breaking spatial symmetry , since they are characterized as condensation of bound multi - magnons@xcite or spin - triplet resonating valence bond state.@xcite the absence of both spin long - range order and lattice symmetry breaking makes it difficult to find them in experiments .",
    "furthermore , no clear experimental proof of the spin multipolar orders has ever been reported , because there is no established experimental method of probing spin multipolar orders .",
    "thanks to recent theoretical studies , it has been gradually recognized that magnetic multipolar states occur in several geometrically frustrated spin-@xmath1 magnets , especially , in low dimensions .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we focus on spin-@xmath1 frustrated chains with ferromagnetic ( fm ) nearest - neighboring exchange @xmath5 and competing antiferromagnetic ( af ) next - nearest - neighboring exchange @xmath6 . the hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spin-@xmath1 operator on the @xmath9th site , and @xmath10 is the applied magnetic field along the @xmath11 axis .",
    "recent studies revealed that this model possesses a series of field - induced multipolar tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid phases in high magnetization regime.@xcite these multipolar tl liquids are interpreted as a hard - core bose gas of multi - magnon bound states,@xcite where the number @xmath12 of magnons forming a multi - magnon bound state changes successively from @xmath13 to 4 with varying @xmath14 . in the multipolar phase with @xmath13 , the quadrupolar ( or spin nematic ) operator @xmath15 exhibits a quasi long - range order .",
    "similarly , the octupolar ( or triatic ) operator @xmath16 and the hexadecapolar operator @xmath17 show a quasi long - range order , respectively , in the phases with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in all of these phases",
    ", the longitudinal spin correlation also decays algebraically , while the transverse spin correlation is short - ranged .",
    "these characteristic properties of the multipolar tl liquid phases are distinct from those in the standard tl liquid ( e.g. , spin-@xmath1 heisenberg chain ) .",
    "numerical studies@xcite of the quadrupolar and octupolar tl liquid phases showed that the relevant multipolar correlations are dominant in the high - magnetization regime , whereas the longitudinal spin - density - wave ( sdw ) correlation becomes dominant in the lower - magnetization regime .",
    "we call the high - field multipolar states with @xmath13 and 3 _ quadrupolar and octupolar liquids _ and the low - field multipolar states _ sdw@xmath20 and sdw@xmath21 liquids _ , respectively , following ref .  .    in these multipolar tl liquids ,",
    "bulk static quantities , such as entropy , specific heat , and uniform susceptibility , exhibit qualitatively the same behaviors as those of standard tl liquids , and hence it is impossible to distinguish multipolar and standard tl liquids from them . to detect direct evidence of their ordering , we need to measure multiple - spin order parameter or relevant multiple - spin correlation functions , which is generally difficult . instead , to find any indirect evidence , it is necessary to specify an effective method of detecting any signature of spin multipolar ordering through usual experiments .",
    "recently , ref .   has proposed an experimental way of detecting a signature of multipolar tl liquids , showing that the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) relaxation rate @xmath0 decreases with lowering temperature @xmath22 in the multipolar tl liquids near saturation .",
    "this is completely different from the behavior of standard tl liquids in one - dimensional ( 1d ) af magnets such as the spin-@xmath1 heisenberg chain , in which @xmath0 always increases with lowering @xmath22 irrespective of the value of applied magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is generally hard to experimentally approach the vicinity of the saturation field , especially , in magnets with strong exchange couplings .",
    "in fact , the saturation field of a @xmath2-@xmath3 magnet @xmath4 is about @xmath23  t ,  @xcite and to perform nmr measurement under such a high field is not an easy task .",
    "an experimentally detecting scheme at low magnetic field is therefore desirable .",
    "it was also shown in ref .   that the momentum dependence of dynamical structure factors in the multipolar tl liquids shows a distinct difference from that of the spin-@xmath1 af heisenberg chain .    in this paper , we reexamine the nmr relaxation rate @xmath0 in the spin quadrupolar ( nematic ) and sdw@xmath20 tl liquids , including both low and high - magnetic - field regimes , and evaluate its field and temperature dependence quantitatively . to this end , we combine the field - theoretical ( bosonization ) approach with the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method , substituting numerical values for nonuniversal parameters in analytic results .",
    "we compare these results with the relaxation rate @xmath0 of the spin-@xmath1 af heisenberg chain .",
    "it is found that , in addition to the temperature dependence , the field dependence of @xmath0 in the nematic and sdw@xmath20 liquids clearly differs from that in the usual tl liquid of the spin-@xmath1 af chain . in the @xmath2-@xmath3 chain ,",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath0 slowly decreases with increase of magnetic field ( or is almost independent of the field ) in the low - field sdw@xmath20 regime and increases suddenly in the high - field nematic regime near saturation , whereas it increases monotonically , as a function of the field , in the usual tl liquid of the spin-@xmath1 af chain .",
    "the non - monotonic field dependence of @xmath0 is a unique characteristic of the multipolar tl liquids in spin-@xmath1 @xmath2-@xmath3 chains .",
    "furthermore , if we tune the direction of the field @xmath10 , we can eliminate the dominant contribution to @xmath0 in the multipolar phases and thereby make @xmath0 show exponential decays at low temperature in both nematic and sdw@xmath20 liquids .",
    "this exponential decay is caused by a spin gap in the spin transverse excitations , which is also a unique property of the multipolar tl liquids .",
    "our prediction would be applicable in nmr experiments of quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) edge - sharing cuprate magnets , such as @xmath4 ( refs .  ) , @xmath24 ( ref .  ) , @xmath25 ( refs .  ) , @xmath26 ( refs .  ) and @xmath27 ( ref .  ) , whose magnetic properties are expected to be described by the spin-@xmath28 @xmath2-@xmath3 model with fm @xmath2 and af @xmath3 .",

    "similar characteristic behavior of @xmath0 is also expected in the higher - order multipolar liquid phases in the @xmath2-@xmath3 spin chain , since these phases share essentially the same properties of spin correlations and the field @xmath10 dependence of the tl - liquid parameter .",

    "the leading terms of @xmath227 can be absorbed into the free - boson part by shifting the field @xmath228 .",

    "the other dm interactions @xmath244 with @xmath193 parallel to the @xmath245 axis do not possess any slowly - moving operator within a naive calculation based on the bosonization , but they generally have the ability to generate @xmath232 , which is allowed from the symmetry argument .",

    "@xmath0 of multipolar phases in the @xmath2-@xmath3 chain becomes a thermal activation form @xmath113 .",
