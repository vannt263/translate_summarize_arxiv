    "are strong only for @xmath17  @xcite , whereas for ucu@xmath1pd@xmath2 nfl behavior is significant over a range of concentrations ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this raises the possibility that nfl behavior is strong only in ucu@xmath10pt because in this alloy series , unlike ucu@xmath1pd@xmath2 , the concentration  @xmath17 is a quantum critical point  @xcite .    in these alloys",
    "the transverse - field @xmath0sr ( tf-@xmath0sr ) relaxation rate ( i.e. , the width of the @xmath0sr line ) is due to an inhomogeneous spread @xmath19 of muon knight shifts  @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "this spread is in turn a measure of the spread  @xmath21 in magnetic susceptibility  @xmath22 from the basic relation  @xmath23 .",
    "the relaxation rate becomes very large at low temperatures in a number of nfl materials including ucu@xmath1pd@xmath2 and ucu@xmath10pt  @xcite .",
    "early nmr observations of this effect in ucu@xmath1pd@xmath2  @xcite were taken as evidence for the `` kondo disorder '' model  @xcite for disorder - driven nfl behavior .",
    "this motivated a similar tf-@xmath0sr study of the ucu@xmath1pt@xmath2 alloy system .",
    "the @xmath0sr experiments reported here were carried out using the general purpose spectrometer at the paul scherrer institute , villigen , switzerland .",

    "the increase is weaker still for ucu@xmath1pt@xmath2 , @xmath7 and 2.5 , where the rates are practically independent of @xmath11 .",
    "a heuristic model  @xcite is useful in understanding this low - temperature increase .",
    "assume a curie - weiss form @xmath24 where @xmath8 is a characteristic energy ( here @xmath25 ) that is inhomogeneously distributed .",
    "then crudely ( to first order ) a spread @xmath12 in @xmath8 yields a spread @xmath26 in @xmath22 , where @xmath27 is the spatially - averaged susceptibility .",
    "so we expect @xmath28 if disorder in the characteristic energy produces an inhomogeneous distribution of the susceptibility .",
    "a plot of the fractional spread in muon knight shift @xmath29 vs.  @xmath27 , with temperature an implicit parameter , is a useful presentation of these results . here",
    "@xmath30 is an effective coupling constant that describes the interaction between @xmath31-ion spins and muons taking into account the spatial correlation of the disorder  @xcite .",

    "exhibit this behavior ( the small feature for @xmath34 is mainly due to a low - temperature anomaly in @xmath22 , probably caused by paramagnetic impurities ) .     vs.  spatially - averaged ( bulk ) susceptibility @xmath27 , with temperature",

    "experimentally @xmath29 is not quite proportional to @xmath22 , which is natural given the crude linear approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bernal ] ) . the departure from proportionality at small @xmath22 ( high temperatures )",
    "may be due to thermally - activated muon diffusion , which motionally narrows the line and reduces @xmath19 , but this mechanism is activated and can not account for the gradual and roughly proportional increase of @xmath29 with increasing @xmath27 at lower temperatures .",
    "this behavior , which as outlined above provides evidence for a broad distribution of characteristic energies , is observed for all samples .",
    "we observe large values of @xmath29 ( @xmath362 ) at low temperatures in both ucu@xmath10pt and ucu@xmath10pd .",
    "since @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the spatially - averaged characteristic energy , we have @xmath39 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : curie])([eq : bernal ] ) .",
    "thus we find a broad distribution of @xmath8 ( @xmath40 ) in the `` inhomogeneous characteristic energy '' scenario described above .",
    "such a broad distribution is essential for nfl behavior in the disorder - driven kondo disorder  @xcite and griffiths - phase  @xcite models , since in these pictures nfl properties are due to uncompensated spins with @xmath41  @xcite .    in ucu@xmath1pt@xmath2 , @xmath7 and 2.5 , the values of @xmath29 as @xmath42 ( i.e. , the data for highest susceptibilites in fig .  2 )",
    "are smaller than for @xmath3 .",
    "this result agrees with thermodynamic and transport measurements  @xcite , which show a return to fermi - liquid behavior for these concentrations .",
    "in contrast , in ucu@xmath1pd@xmath2 @xmath29 at low temperatures is similar for @xmath3 and 1.5  @xcite .",
    "the slope  @xmath33 is roughly independent of @xmath11 in ucu@xmath1pt@xmath2 , and a factor of two larger than the slope in ucu@xmath1pd@xmath2 .",
    "why is @xmath33 larger in ucu@xmath1pt@xmath2 , @xmath7 and 2.5 , if nfl effects are smaller in these alloys ?",
    "the zero - temperature susceptibility  @xmath43 is a factor of two smaller in ucu@xmath10pt than in ucu@xmath10pd , so that the characteristic energy is a factor of two larger in ucu@xmath10pt .",
    "the values of @xmath44 are comparable ( fig .",
    "2 ) , so that we obtain a larger @xmath12 and a larger slope @xmath33 for ucu@xmath10pt than for ucu@xmath10pd . for @xmath45 and 2.5",
    "@xmath43 is smaller still , so that even with the larger slope @xmath44 remains relatively small .",
    "in ucu@xmath10pd we find @xmath46  k from the slope in fig .",
    "this together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowtemp ] ) gives @xmath47  k , in good agreement with the paramagnetic curie - weiss temperature = 133  k from @xmath48  @xcite . in ucu@xmath10pt a similar analysis yields @xmath49  k and @xmath50  k , in agreement with the paramagnetic curie - weiss temperature = 200 - 300  k from @xmath48 for @xmath512.5 .",
    "the increase of @xmath38 with increasing @xmath11 is consistent with the observed decrease of the bulk susceptibility at low temperatures  @xcite .    in disorder - driven nfl theories",
    "the important parameter is @xmath44 .",
    "our results show that the increase of @xmath38 in ucu@xmath1pt@xmath2 , both in comparison with ucu@xmath1pd@xmath2 and as @xmath52 is increased , produces a decrease in @xmath44 , and hence of nfl behavior , for ucu@xmath1pt@xmath2 .",
    "the data are consistent with ascribing the nfl behavior of both alloy systems to disorder effects , rather than to the proximity of a quantum critical point in one alloy system but not in the other .",
