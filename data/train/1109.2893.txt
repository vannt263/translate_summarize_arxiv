    "the discrepancy between the type 2 behavior of the hh model and experiment was explained by modifying a single parameter in the term describing the potassium current @xcite . in a recent study of the periodically stimulated hh model by the present author",

    "the dependence of the firing rate on the current amplitude scales with a square root above the threshold , consistent with a saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the hh neuron s response at resonant frequencies can be divided into three regimes : ( i ) short pulses , where the width @xmath0 does not exceed the optimal width @xmath1 associated with a minimum threshold @xmath1 , ( ii ) @xmath2 , and ( iii ) @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "@xcite noted the similarity of class 1 and class 2 neuron response to sinusoidal signal at low frequencies .",
    "this is not surprising , once we note , that the threshold bistability , and a discontinuity of the firing rate @xmath39 associated with it , appears first in the limit of small @xmath23 and extends towards larger @xmath23 with decreasing @xmath28 .",
    "when @xmath81 , the 3:1 state becomes bistable and the entire threshold in the regime of small @xmath23 rises significantly .",
    "the emergence of class 3 behavior may be viewed as a strong rigidity of neuron dynamics in the limit of high stimulation period .",
    "based on this relationship between mmt and the global bifurcation diagram we can classify neuron excitability for stimuli of finite frequency : ( i ) class 1 , where the firing rate is a continuous function of @xmath24 everywhere along the threshold , ( ii ) class 2 , with bistabilities at the edges of high - order locked - in states , ( iii ) class 3 , where the mmt exists , and ( iv ) class 4 , where both the mmt and the bistabilities are absent and the neuron responds to a constant current by emitting only a few spikes .",
    "the presence of the mmt in both the ml and hh model suggests that the same transition is present in other resonant neuron models classified as type 2 or type 3 cells .",
