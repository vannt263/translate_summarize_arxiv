    "protoneutron star is a hot , lepton - rich neutron object which is formed in type - ii supernovae explosion as the final stage of a star more massive than about 8 @xmath2 - 25 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a protoneutron star depends on two factors : the relativistic equation of state of the stellar matter and neutrino interactions which provide to the phenomena of neutrino trapping in a neutron star matter .",
    "neutrino interactions play a crucial role during the creation of the protoneutron star . at the beginning , this star is very hot and lepton - rich , after a typical time of several tens of seconds , the star becomes cold , deleptonized object and the neutron star is formed . during the collapse enormous energy of the order of @xmath4 ergs",
    "is released just through neutrinos .",
    "the released energy is equal to the gravitational binding energy of a newly formed neutron star . in this paper",
    "the mass - radius relation of the protoneutron star is constructed for different temperature cases . a particularly interesting situation results in the occurrence of unstable areas which allows distinctively different evolutionary tracks . in the new - born protoneutron star ( less than several seconds )",
    "neutrinos are trapped locally in the dense stellar matter at densities greater than @xmath5 @xmath6 , forming an ultrarelativistic and degenerate fermi gas .",
    "this trapped neutrinos have an influence on the equation of state @xcite .",
    "+ the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "+ in sect.1 the general properties of nonrotating and rotating protoneutron stars are calculated . in sect.2 the employed equation of state",
    "is obtained in the approach of relativistic mean - field approximation .",
    "this approach imply the nucleons interactions through the exchange of meson fields .",
    "thus the model considered here comprises : electrons , muons , neutrinos and scalar , vector - isoscalar and vector - isovector mesons .",
    "consequently the pressure and energy density are characterized by contributions coming from these components . in sect.3 the influence of rotation on the protoneutron stars parameters such as : masses , radii and moment of inertia are calculated .",
    "the obtained results for the given form of the equation of state followed by a discussion of the implications of these results are presented in sect.4 and sect.5 .",
    "+ in this article the signature @xmath7 is used , in which the dirac s matrix is defined by @xmath8 and@xmath9 and @xmath10 . in case of the fermion fields it is more convenient to use the reper field @xmath11 defined as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the flat minkowski space - time matrix .",
    "this paper presents a basic model of a protoneutron star in the rmf approximation @xcite .",
    "the relativistic approach to high - density nuclear matter in this approach was proposed by walecka . since then",
    ", this theory has been applied successfully to many subjects in nuclear many body problems . especially the walecka model ( qhd ) and",
    "its nonlinear extensions have been quite successfully and widely used for the description of hadronic matter and finite nuclei . increasing interest in the neutron star matter at finite temperature has been observed recently in relation to the problems of hot neutron stars and protoneutron stars and their evolution in particular .",
    "theories concerning protoneutron stars are being discussed in works by prakash et al .",
    "glendenning @xcite has studied the properties of neutron star in the framework of nuclear relativistic field theory . in the field theoretical approach",
    "the nuclear matter is described as the baryons interaction through mesons @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 exchange .",
    "we define an action of the protoneutron star through the lagrangian density @xmath17 @xmath18 the lagrangian density function of this theory can be represented as the sum @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 describe the baryonic , leptonic , mesonic and gravitional sector , respectively .",
    "the fermion fields are composed of neutrons , protons , muons , electrons and neutrinos @xmath24 the baryonic sector of the lagrangian density function is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the covariant derivative @xmath27 the leptonic part of the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) is define as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is higgs field and this field has only the residual form@xmath30 the value of @xmath31 @xmath32 comes from the electroweak interaction scale . in the mesonic sector the lagrangian density function is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scalar field , @xmath35 is the electromagnetic stress tensor @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are vector mesons field strength given by @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the meson @xmath15 and @xmath16 masses .",
    "the potential function @xmath43 possesses a polynomial form @xmath44 introduced by boguta and bodmer @xcite in order to get a correct value of the compressibility @xmath45 of nuclear matter at saturation density .",
    "the model described by the lagrangian function ( [ lag ] ) with such an ansatz for the potential @xmath43 guarantee a very good description of bulk nuclear matter properties for different parameter sets .",
    "it is not possible for neutron star matter to be purely neutron one . as it was stated above the fermion fields",
    "are composed of protons , neutrons , electrons , muons and neutrinos because we are dealing here with the electrically neutral neutron star matter being in @xmath46-equilibrium .",
    "such a matter possesses a highly asymmetric character caused by the presence of small amounts of protons and electrons . finally , the standard gravitational sector has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the parameters entering the lagrangian function are the coupling constants @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and self - interacting coupling constants @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the parameters employed in this model are collected in the table [ tab : 1 ] . in our calculations",
    ", we used the tm1 @xcite parameter set , which has a capability to reproduce the known results of finite nuclei as well as normal nuclear matter .",
    ".[tab : 1]the parameters set of the model @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the main aim of this paper was to study the protoneutron star parameters especially the masses and radii as the most sensitive ones to the form the equation of state .",
    "the employed form of eos in the tm1 set which was extended to the finite temperature cases .",
    "the considered model comprises not only nucleons and electrons , which are necessary for the @xmath46 stable matter , but the neutrinos as well .",
    "the presence of neutrinos is characteristic for hot young protoneutron stars .",
    "neutrinos give not negligible contribution to the pressure and energy density .",
    "as the radius of protoneutron stars increases the neutrino pressure starts to prevail over the pressure coming from the remaining components .",
    "constructing the mass - radius relations for protoneutron stars the stable and unstable areas appeared .",
    "this indicate that there are several possible stellar evolution tracks for the configuration with constant baryon number .",
    "these evolutionary tracks are strictly connected with the decreasing star temperature and thus with the decreasing neutrino chemical potential and lepton number .",
    "the final result is the cold deleptonized ( the neutrino chemical potential equals zero ) object .",
    "the influence of rotation on the protoneutron star parameters is significant . in this paper",
    "the case of slowly rotating protoneutron star is considered .",
    "the obtained unstable configuration for the fixed temperature ( @xmath54 mev ) and lepton number ( @xmath0 ) occurring in the density range ( @xmath55 @xmath56 ) are relevant to rapid change in the moment of inertia of the star ( fig.13 and fig.14 ) . for the rotating star",
    "the mass - radius relation depends on the star angular velocity thus the values of @xmath57 affects the instability areas . for the employed eos there",
    "exists the ranges of masses where hot , lepton rich protoneutron star can be stabilized against gravity but loosing leptons these objects became gravitationally unstable .",
    "the instability areas as strictly connected with the presence of neutrinos and the thermal pressure effects .",
