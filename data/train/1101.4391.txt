    "the latter scale was found in ref .   and is controlled by the gate voltage , @xmath412 for the typical concentration @xmath413@xmath414 , the gate potential @xmath4151v , and @xmath416 , one thus gets an estimate @xmath417 nm .",
    "this result is also believed to be applicable in the case of etched mesostructures , e.g. those used in the mzi setups . in this case",

    "one expects that the above modes with @xmath420 should match the two chiral bosonic modes of our theory .",

    "( [ eq : u0_coulomb ] ) and ( [ eq : w_pq ] ) , we obtain the estimate for the scale @xmath279 in our theory , @xmath421 nm .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath3 . for the typical size of the mzi , @xmath422 m , one gets the ratio @xmath423 .",

    "this discrepancy may be partly explained by the fact that , according to eq .",

    "in this paper we have discussed the influence of the coulomb interaction on the quantum coherence in the electronic mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) formed by integer quantum hall edge states at filling fractions @xmath2 and @xmath3 out of equilibrium .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we have developed the non - equilibrium functional bosonization framework which enables us to build up the keldysh action of interacting electrons in the mzi .",
    "the most non - trivial term in the action is expressed in terms of a single - particle time - dependent interferometer scattering matrix in the dynamically fluctuating field and has a structure of a fredholm determinant similar to those appearing in the theory of full counting statistics .",
    "we have used this action to analyze the limit of weak electron tunneling between interferometer arms in the case of arbitrarily strong e - e interaction .",
    "our theory contains all interaction - induced effects on transport through mzi , including charging , dispersion non - linearity , and non - equilibrium decoherence .",
    "2 .   restricting at first the theoretical analysis to the gaussian approximation for electron phase fluctuations , we have readily reproduced the previous theoretical results related to oscillations ( lobe structure ) in the dependence of the visibility on the bias voltage .",
    "going beyond the gaussian approximation , we have used a real - time instanton approach to evaluate the non - equilibrium dephasing rates that lead to further suppression of the aharanov - bohm oscillations in conductance with the increase of voltage .",
    "we have found that the out - of - equilibrium dephasing rate is proportional to the voltage dependent shot noise of the first quantum point contact ( qpc1 ) , defining the mzi , and originates from the emission of non - equilibrium plasmons and neutral bosonic modes in course of inelastic electron tunneling .",
    "the results obtained within the model of short - range interaction ( sec .  [ s3 ] ) show strong contradictions to the experiment .",
    "specifically , in the case of equal arms the visibility oscillations in the @xmath3 interferometer do not decay with voltage .",
    "for @xmath2 the problem is even more severe , as the visibility does not depend on the voltage at all .",
    "considering the realistic model of the long - range ( @xmath1 ) coulomb interaction , we are able to explain the experimentally observed dependence of the visibility of the interference signal at filling fraction @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the origin of this effect is found to be a combination of three factors : * the electrostatic phase shift effect , related to the charge imbalance on different arms of the interferometer , * the interaction induced effect of the plasmon dispersion , and * the out - of - equilibrium decoherence due to the intrinsic shot noise .",
    "+ using realistic parameters , we find three lobes in the bias dependence of visibility in the case of @xmath2 ( figs .  [",
    "fig : vis_n1_l ] and [ fig : vis_n1_a ] ) and structures with many lobes for @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vis_n2_l30 ] ) , in agreement with the experiments .",
    "the energy scale for the lobe structure in the visibility for @xmath3 is given by the thouless energy of the mzi which is estimated as @xmath431ev for realistic parameters , again in good agreement with experiment .",
    "for @xmath2 the energy scale for the lobes in our theory is enhanced by a factor @xmath432 , which is partly compensated by a difference in the drift velocity ( and thus thouless energy ) at @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "there remains some discrepancy in this point with the experiment which indicates that the energy scales for @xmath3 and @xmath2 lobe structures are practically equal .",
    "this issue may be worth further study .",
    "we anticipate that the approach developed in this work will be useful for a much broader class of electronic interference setups relevant to current or forthcoming experiments .",
