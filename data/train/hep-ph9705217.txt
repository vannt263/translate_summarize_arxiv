    "hadronic systems produced in  annihilation have their origin in a uniquely simple quark - antiquark state .",
    "while the standard model of particle physics provides a well tested description of the reaction , the subsequent production of observable hadrons is less well understood .",
    "a parton shower , described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , is normally invoked to describe the initial fragmentation phase . in the subsequent non - perturbative hadronization process",
    ", the partons become the hadrons which are experimentally observed .",
    "multihadronic  annihilation events , with no beam or target fragments to confuse their experimental or theoretical interpretation , provide the most powerful system available for the study of the transition from the partons of perturbative qcd to the hadrons of the laboratory .    between 1989 and 1995 , the large electron positron collider ( lep ) at cern delivered an integrated luminosity of about 170  pb@xmath2 per detector at and around the z@xmath0 peak , providing each of its four dedicated experiments , aleph , delphi , l3 and opal , with some 6 million e@xmath3e@xmath4 annihilation events , 70% of which were multihadronic .",
    "these events have enabled the experiments to conduct detailed studies of many aspects of parton hadronization . over the same period ,",
    "the slac linear collider ( slc ) delivered a more modest number of events , initially to the mark ii detector and then to the sld detector , which has now accumulated about 200k z@xmath0 events .",
    "although its luminosity is lower than that of lep , the slc is able to provide highly polarized electron beams .",
    "while lep has now entered phase 2 , running at higher energies , analysis of the z@xmath0 peak data will continue for some time .",
    "the slc , with polarized beams , is scheduled to run at the z@xmath0 for several more years .    in this review ,",
    "we look at the present understanding of the non - perturbative hadronization process in the context of the recent experimental results from lep and slc . a brief introduction to the electroweak theory of  annihilation",
    "is followed by a heuristic picture of the transition from perturbative partons to final - state hadrons .",
    "after this , the role of perturbative qcd in determining the structures and particle content of events is discussed .",
    "models of the non - perturbative hadronization phase are then covered  independent fragmentation , string fragmentation and cluster fragmentation are discussed in detail and a comparison is given of the main features of the different models .",
    "the lep and slc machines and their associated detectors are then described , with emphasis on the features relevant to measurements of individual hadrons from z@xmath0 decay .",
    "next the experimental data on single inclusive identified particles are summarised , and the results interpreted in the light of the different models .",
    "results on spin phenomena , such as baryon polarization and vector meson spin alignment are then covered , and this is followed by discussion of results on correlations , including bose einstein effects , strange particle rapidity and angular correlations , and intermittency ; where possible the results are interpreted within the context of theory and models .",
    "differences between quark and gluon initiated jets are then dealt with , and the review ends with a look forward to what may still be learned from the available lep and slc data , and the forthcoming slc data .",
    "the ( initial ) numbers , directions , polarizations and flavours of the quarks produced in  annihilation are determined by the electroweak couplings of the exchanged vector bosons .",
    "the full , tree - level expression for the differential cross section for  in the centre of momentum ( com ) frame is given as a function of quark s polar angle , @xmath5 , measured relative to the electron beam direction , and total com energy squared , @xmath6 , by : @xmath7 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "for example @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 etc , with @xmath18 the fermion s electric charge , normalized to that of the electron , @xmath19 the fermion s third component of weak , su(2)@xmath20 , isospin and @xmath21 the sine(cosine ) of the weinberg angle .",
    "the number of colours is @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant .",
    "the dependence on the initial lepton and final quark longitudinal polarizations are via @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for spin along the com direction of travel ( helicity basis ) . in the absence of transverse beam polarization",
    "there is no azimuthal angular dependence .    at @xmath26",

    "the total hadronic branching fraction is @xmath31 .",
    "the beam polarization has little influence on the relative rates of produced quarks , although the total rate is proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "however only a single polarized beam can significantly alter the quark polar angle distribution , as can be seen from the forward - backward asymmetry ( for pure z@xmath0 exchange and @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 since @xmath35 is only @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) then , given polarized beams , one has a powerful statistical way to identify separately quark and antiquark jets based on their direction .",
    "the quarks are naturally produced highly polarized : @xmath38 this result is for unpolarized lepton beams , pure z@xmath0 exchange and @xmath33 ; the full expression depends little on the lepton beam polarization .    for qcd studies at the z@xmath0  @xcite the effect of initial - state electromagnetic radiation ( isr )",
    "is of rather minor significance , unlike in the case of electroweak studies  @xcite .",
    "the primary effect of isr is to lower the effective @xmath30 , leading to a distortion of the breit - wigner lineshape given by .",
    "however the basic quantities of relevance from a qcd perspective , quark flavour mix , polarization etc , are only rather weak functions of @xmath30 .",
    "further , because of the z@xmath0 resonance the cross section falls rapidly when isr occurs , mitigating against its effects ( even so the peak cross section falls by @xmath39 compared to ) , in contrast to the situation at lep 2 and higher energies where isr is very important  @xcite .",
    "the effects of _ final - state _ radiation , particularly of gluons but also of photons , form one theme of this review .",
    "the effect of final - state radiation on the total hadronic cross section can be summarized in the multiplicative factor  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the strong coupling constant @xmath42 and @xmath43 is a measure of the quark - gluon coupling strength .",
    "flavour ( mass ) dependent effects and electroweak radiative corrections are small  both occur at the 1% level , and need not concern us here  @xcite .",
    "the description of a multihadronic event commences by specifying a set of primary partons ( q//g ) distributed according to an exact z@xmath0 decay matrix element , such as .",
    "it is customary to identify three basic stages in the transition of these partons into detected hadrons  @xcite .",
    "first a parton ( or , equivalently , dipole ) cascade , formulated according to pqcd , evolves the primary partons from the hard scattering scale @xmath44 into secondary partons at a ( fixed ) cut - off scale @xmath45 gev .",
    "it is during the calculable stages , hard subprocess and shower , that the event s global features are determined : energy dependences , event shapes , multiplicity etc . in a second stage , carried out at the fixed , low virtuality scale @xmath46 ,",
    "a model is employed to convert the secondary partons into hadrons .",
    "the second stage is essentially energy @xmath47 independent , up to power corrections , and assumed to be local in nature .",
    "finally unstable primary particles are decayed into stable hadrons and leptons according to decay tables  @xcite .",
    "schematically the fragmentation function is given by : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the probability to find a hadron of type h carrying a fraction @xmath50 of the parton s momentum , in a jet initiated by the parton @xmath51 , whose maximum virtuality is @xmath52 .",
    "the h represent possible intermediate hadrons .",

    "the quarks shake off most of their cloud of virtual particles , so that any structure they have is on a scale below @xmath64 .",
    "that is they behave as bare ( more properly half - dressed ) colour charges until the gluon field has had time to regenerate out to a typical hadron size @xmath65  fm .",
    "allowing for the boost , this takes a time @xmath66  fm , where the second approximation is appropriate to light hadrons .    the fact that @xmath67 raises the issue of how charges are conserved over the space - like separated distances involved",
    "of course the accelerated quarks will radiate gluons and here two new time scales are relevant .",
    "first , from the off - shellness of the quark prior to emission , the formation time of a real gluon of 3-momentum ( = energy ) @xmath68 is @xmath69 ( the uncertainty relation gives the proper lifetime of the virtual state as the reciprocal of its off - shellness , during which time it will travel a 4-distance @xmath70 in the laboratory frame , where @xmath71 is the virtual state s 4-momentum ) .",
    "second , for the gluon to reach a transverse separation of @xmath72 and become independent of the quark takes a time @xmath73 , whilst the hadronization time may be written @xmath74 .    for this quark - gluon picture to make sense we require",
    "@xmath75 so that @xmath76 ; this is natural as it implies that @xmath77 , making perturbation theory applicable .",
    "if @xmath78 then we can say nothing . on the borderline are quanta with @xmath79 ; these feel the strong interaction and are responsible for holding hadrons together .",
    "we distinguish these from the essentially free perturbative gluons by the name _",
    "gluers_. the first _",
    "gluers _ form after only 1  fm , having @xmath80 .",
    "thus _ gluers _ immediately form in the wake of the primary partons blanching their colour field and leaving two fast separating charge neutral systems .",
    "thus the slowest hadrons form first , close to the interaction point , in what may be called an ` inside - out ' pattern  @xcite .    on quite general grounds the distribution of _ gluers _ in qcd can be estimated using : @xmath81\\times\\frac{\\d k}{k}\\propto\\frac{\\d k}{k}\\ ] ] here the logarithmic @xmath82 dependence reflects the fact that the coupling constant is dimensionless , the logarithmic @xmath68 dependence follows from the gluon being massless and only the kernel function @xmath83 , which is of order unity , depends on details of the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "the distribution is thus governed by longitudinal phase space and leads to hadron production on rapidity plateaux along the directions of the initial partons .",
    "not all quanta are emitted at low @xmath84 and in a significant range , @xmath85 , a shower of perturbative gluons is possible .",
    "a hard gluon emitted at an angle @xmath53 becomes a separate colour source at @xmath86 , again raising the issue of charge conservation .",
    "fortunately a _ gluer _ emitted at the same angle @xmath53 would appear just in the right place and at the right time to blanch the tail of the separating gluon s colour field .",
    "this gluon then acts as a new source of _ gluers _ , restricted such that @xmath87 .",
    "that is equivalent to a boosted ( @xmath88 ) quark jet of a reduced scale @xmath89 and with the substitution @xmath90 for the parton s charge in  @xcite .",

    "an option also exists which does not employ    a parton shower but tries to use instead higher - order hard - subprocess    matrix elements plus string hadronization .",
    "as stated in the bulk properties of hadronic events in z@xmath0 decay are established early in the fragmentation when virtualities are large and qcd perturbation theory is valid .",
    "it is an important issue to establish to what extent pqcd dominates and what contributions are made by non - perturbative effects .",
    "two basic approaches are used to calculate hadronic event properties .",
    "the use of fixed - order perturbation theory is justified by the smallness of the running strong coupling constant  @xcite at @xmath104 .",
    "known results include the total hadronic cross section to three loops , order-@xmath105  @xcite .",
    "complete one - loop , order-@xmath106 calculations are available  @xcite for planar ( i.e. 3-jet dominated ) event shapes , including contributions due to the orientation of the event plane with respect to the beam direction  @xcite and to quark mass effects  @xcite .",
    "partial order-@xmath107 results are known for 4-jet distributions  @xcite .",
    "tree - level calculations , up to order-@xmath105 , of 5-jet distributions are also available  @xcite .",
    "however a complication arises in this approach because tree - level diagrams diverge whenever external partons become soft or collinear and related negative divergences arise in virtual ( loop ) diagrams ( in addition to ultraviolet divergences ) .",
    "fortunately , in sufficiently inclusive measurements such as the total hadronic cross section it is guaranteed that the two sets of divergences cancel  @xcite . unfortunately in more exclusive quantities such as event shapes the cancellation",
    "is no longer complete and large logarithmic terms remain , generically of the form @xmath108 .",
    "since @xmath109 is of order unity this can spoil the convergence of naive perturbation theory .    in the second approach",

    "monte carlo event generators implement solutions to these equations as parton showers  @xcite .",
    "more recently the resummed results for a number of event shapes have been calculated  @xcite and combined with the fixed order approach  @xcite .",

    "at very low @xmath30 little structure is present in hadronic events , beyond that due to the presence of hadronic resonances , and these can be described essentially by isotropic phase space  @xcite .",
    "this is because the momentum scales involved in the hadronization , typically 200  mev , are comparable with those of the proto - jets . at higher energy , due to the preferred collinear nature of gluon radiation , the hadrons clearly form collimated pairs of back - to - back jets with angular distributions compatible with those of the primary q@xmath117 pairs  @xcite . around @xmath118",

    "are at parton level  @xcite , hadronization corrections , derived from monte carlo models , must be applied before making comparisons to data . away from phase space boundaries the corrections are modest , but not negligible ( of order 10% ) , and order-@xmath106",
    "calculations generally describe the data well  @xcite , particularly so when resummed  @xcite .",

    "agreement between data and monte carlo is less satisfactory , with 30% discrepancies occurring for @xmath120 and the 4-jet rate  @xcite .",
    "hopefully the situation will be improved by matching the showers to exact fixed - order results .",
    "this will prove important because of a reliance on monte carlo models in establishing variables to discriminate at higher energies between continuum qcd events and other physics signals , such as w@xmath3w@xmath4 pairs .",
    "this is in addition to their importance in qcd and in increasingly demanding electroweak measurements such as those involving jet charge  @xcite .",
    "establishing agreement between the predictions of event generator programs and data for event shape variables has proved very important for confirming our ability to model qcd as a whole and has led to a first generation tuning of the monte carlo models  @xcite .",
    "a second generation of tunings , which also take into account data on identified particle production , are now becoming available  @xcite .",
    "this tuning is not a trivial exercise as it is often the case that a distribution depends in a complex way on a model s free parameters .",
    "however some specific sensitivities have been identified .",
    "the 3-jet rate is very sensitive to the qcd scale parameter @xmath121 , indicating the dominance of the shower and pqcd .",
    "event shapes and inclusive momentum spectra are sensitive to the shower cut - off @xmath46 , and also to parameters controlling the generation of transverse momentum in the hadronization . in programs that lack a shower stage it is necessary to retune the hadronization model at each @xmath30 since this must describe the whole fragmentation process including the perturbative @xmath30 dependence found in a shower .",
    "as noted above , hadronization corrections , which at present are inherently model dependent , need to be applied to partonic predictions before comparison can be made to hadronic event properties .",
    "empirically the differences between quantities measured at the hadron level and the partonic predictions are found to be power behaved : @xmath122 .",
    "for example , in the case of massless quarks , @xmath123  @xcite , where @xmath124 is the usual ratio of hadronic to @xmath125 pair cross sections ; in fact this result follows from the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite and can be related to the value of the gluon condensate : @xmath126 . in the case of average event shape variables ,",
    "a @xmath127 behaviour is found ( the ope does not apply in this case , due to the presence of multiple scales , and indeed no corresponding dimension-1 local operator exists ) .",
    "this behaviour may be established by going to the power - enhanced , low @xmath52 , region where a @xmath128 variation is easily distinguished from the slow logarithmic variation of the perturbative expressions .",
    "such a @xmath127 behaviour is significant because @xmath129 ; thus to be able to take advantage of a future @xmath130 prediction will require a better understanding of hadronization .",
    "three sources of power corrections are known : instantons , infrared ( ir ) renormalons and ultraviolet renormalons  @xcite .",
    "only ir renormalons are believed to be relevant to the issue of hadronization corrections ; instanton effects are too highly power - suppressed .",
    "the coefficients of pqcd series in @xmath41 generically suffer from a factorial growth , @xmath131 , making the series formally divergent .",
    "a standard technique for dealing with this type of behaviour is to employ a borel transformation  @xcite .",
    "a pole in the transform at @xmath132 would correspond to an @xmath133 term in the borel summed series : these poles are called renormalons . unfortunately the ` residue ' of the pole , equivalent to the coefficient of the @xmath134 term , is not calculable by this purely mathematical technique .",
    "recently a relationship has been suggested between the positions of the renormalons and the power behaviour of perturbative series in the presence of an ir ` regulator '  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the ( resummed ) perturbative calculation probes regions of phase space involving low - virtuality partons where non - perturbative confinement effects should also be important .",
    "if these regions are isolated by introducing a ` cut - off ' into the perturbative calculation then requiring that any cut - off dependence is compensated by the non - perturbative hadronization correction allows the power behaviour to be determined .",
    "using this idea , together with a gluon mass  @xcite , a @xmath127 correction was derived for the thrust @xmath135 , @xmath136-parameter and longitudinal cross section @xmath137 with all the coefficients proportional to a common scale : @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "refinements of this calculation  @xcite have attempted to relate the common scale to a fixed @xmath140 , representing an effective measure of long - range confinement forces at an inclusive level .",
    "a dispersive approach indicates that the numerator of the @xmath127 term may involve several coefficients , for example proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "the subject of power corrections is an active theoretical area and still subject to dispute .",
    "however there exists the exciting prospect of a phenomenology of power corrections .",
    "this is particularly so if the corrections to various processes can be related and so shown to be universal  @xcite or could be developed for full distributions rather than average values .",
    "for example , according to the calculations above , @xmath142 would have no leading @xmath127 power correction , enabling a more accurate high-@xmath52 prediction  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare these speculations with the results of a simple tube model  @xcite calculation .",
    "the idea is that after hadronization a parton jet is equivalent to a tube of hadrons distributed uniformly in rapidity , @xmath143 , along the jet axis with transverse mass @xmath144unit @xmath143 and length @xmath145 .",

    "fitting to data , all these estimates are consistent with @xmath152 gev .",
    "direct photons , which are unaffected by hadronization , offer an alternative way to probe the early perturbative event structure  @xcite .",
    "in these events , cross sections are not simply given in terms of the quark charges but reflect the competition in showers between q@xmath153qg and q@xmath153q@xmath100 branchings in a way that is sensitive to the choice of evolution variable  @xcite . here",
    "agreement with experiment has been less satisfactory  @xcite , particularly for rather soft or very isolated photons ; for example @xmath154-jet+@xmath100 cross - section results  @xcite disfavour the virtuality ordering employed in jetset s parton shower  @xcite .",
    "this has led to some development of the monte carlo shower algorithms  @xcite",
    ". a more critical test will be the rate of soft , wide - angle photons , but here one must be especially wary of non - prompt photons arising from decays of particles produced in the hadronization  @xcite .",
    "long - wavelength quanta see event structures on larger scales and so are sensitive to the presence of neighbouring charged partons  @xcite .",
    "this results in the effective radiating units being charge - anticharge dipoles  @xcite and leads to a suppression of soft gauge quanta due to the requirement of coherence .",
    "this is true of qed and qcd but in the latter , because gluons carry colour charge , one must also allow at leading order for changes in the colour antennae formed by the hard partons .",
    "effects due to colour coherence are expected in both the perturbative and non - perturbative stages of an event  @xcite . in the parton shower",
    "they can be simply incorporated by requiring angular ordering  that is successive branchings are nested  @xcite ; this is known as the modified leading logarithm approximation ( mlla ) .",
    "as noted earlier , in jestet angular ordering is imposed on an initially incoherent shower  @xcite , in herwig it is built into the choice of evolution variable  @xcite , it is intrinsic to the colour dipole model used by ariadne  @xcite and it is not included in cojets  @xcite .",
    "hadronization models also respect an event s colour structure in accordance with local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite , discussed below .",
    "strings may be regarded as the natural limit of an evolving chain of colour dipoles whilst clusters may be thought of as the final , colour neutral , dipoles . in all monte carlo models the treatment of both stages",
    "is based on the large @xmath155 approximation to the colour flow  @xcite which gives very good agreement with known full analytic results  @xcite .",
    "the classic direct test of inter - jet colour coherence is the ` string effect '  a comparison of the particle flows between the jets in g events  @xcite .",
    "as the historic name suggests , the relative depletion between the  and qg jets was expected to have a non - perturbative origin  @xcite ; later , assuming lphd , a perturbative explanation was found  @xcite . to describe the z@xmath0 data",
    "@xcite it is necessary to employ a coherent shower with an approximately equal contribution coming from the non - perturbative hadronization model ( but see  @xcite ) .",
    "a second classic measurement  @xcite , proposed in  @xcite , is the relative depletion between the  pair in g and @xmath100 events  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal angular dependence of particle flow in g events has also been studied  @xcite . in order to avoid having to find jets ,",
    "the energy - multiplicity - multiplicity correlation can be used to measure the inter - jet coherence  @xcite , though in this case the pqcd calculation suffers large corrections  @xcite .",
    "( a related quantity , the asymmetry in the particle - particle correlation , has even been suggested  @xcite as a way to measure intra - jet coherence effects  @xcite . ) again all of the above studies at the z@xmath0 confirm that monte carlo models incorporating a coherent shower give the best descriptions of the data .",
    "unfortunately a test for the ` negative dipole ' , expected in g events when the large @xmath155 approximation is not used , does not appear practical  @xcite .",
    "the intra - jet effect of colour coherence is to limit the production of soft particles in the parton shower , leading to a ` hump - backed plateau ' shape for the particle spectrum in the variable @xmath156  @xcite , where @xmath50 is the ratio of the hadron momentum to the beam energy . by contrast , in the incoherent tube model , based on , there is no gluon suppression and no broad peak forms .",
    "the actual calculation is of the parton ( essentially gluon ) spectrum in a jet at the cut - off scale : @xmath157 , with @xmath158 , which it is then argued also applies to the hadron spectrum .",
    "the result is a rather unwieldy expression so that often lphd is invoked , in the rather technical sense of taking the limit @xmath159  @xcite , to obtain the simpler , more fully evolved , limiting spectrum . finally in the peak region",
    "a distorted ( downward skewed , platykurtic ) gaussian function  @xcite is applicable .",
    "the z@xmath0 data  @xcite are qualitatively well described ; quantitatively the limiting spectrum is a little too narrow in the peak region , where the distorted gaussian fits better , although not in the tails .",
    "the coherent monte carlo event generators  @xcite give the best fits ( however see  @xcite ) .    a particularly interesting measurement on the @xmath160 spectrum",
    "is that of the peak position , @xmath161 .",
    "this occurs at low momentum where the occurence of successive parton branchings should lessen any dependence on the primary quark flavour .",
    "( measurements of the width , skewness , etc are statistics limited and sensitive to primary quark flavour effects in the distribution s high momentum tail ) . in pqcd the @xmath52 dependence of @xmath161 is predicted to be linear in @xmath162 whie the width grows as @xmath163  @xcite .",
    "specifically @xmath164 ( i.e. @xmath165 ) with @xmath166 in the incoherent double logarithm approximation and @xmath167 in the coherent mlla , corresponding to a harder spectrum .",

    "similar conclusions have been reached from breit frame analyses of deep inelastic scattering ep events at hera  @xcite .",
    "a closely related measurement is that of two - particle momentum correlations  @xcite .",
    "qualitative agreement is seen with the expectations based on the pqcd distribution of gluon pairs in a shower  @xcite .",
    "however to obtain quantitative agreement large corrections to the prediction should be anticipated  @xcite .",
    "finally , scaling violations are seen when comparing the fragmentation function , @xmath168 , measured at the z@xmath0 to those from lower energies  @xcite , after making allowance for the varying primary quark favour mix ( see ) . as in deep inelastic scattering",
    "these variations are controlled  @xcite by altarelli - parisi equations which allows @xmath41 to be determined  @xcite .",
    "the integral of the momentum distribution of all particles gives the event multiplicity .",
    "soft particles make a significant contribution to this total so that again colour coherence is important .",
    "the @xmath30 dependence of the first few moments of the distribution of event multiplicities is calculable in mlla  @xcite .",
    "the effect of coherence is to slow the growth of the mean multiplicity with @xmath30  @xcite as compared to the lla result  @xcite .",
    "the mlla prediction for the mean works well when higher - order corrections are included  @xcite , as do several more phenomenological functions of @xmath30  @xcite , including a simple statistical phase space model  @xcite .",
    "however this is not the case for the incoherent cojets model .",
    "the width ( or equivalently the second binomial moment ) is larger than the data  @xcite although further relatively large higher - order corrections might be anticipated from the ratio of leading to next - to - leading order predictions  @xcite . at high energy",
    "the ratios of these moments are expected to become @xmath30 independent , a feature already present in the data .",
    "this would imply kno scaling  @xcite which is indeed seen to work well .",
    "the ratios of moments as given by qcd behave approximately like those of the negative binomial distribution ( nbd )  @xcite ( with parameter @xmath169 ) , though empirically the discretized log normal distribution ( lnd )  @xcite is a better fit to the multiplicity distribution .",
    "multiplicity distributions have also been studied in restricted rapidity intervals  @xcite where the influence of global conservation laws may be reduced .",
    "the shape of the distribution becomes narrower for small rapidity ( @xmath143 ) windows , and some structure , possibly attributable to multi - jet events  @xcite , arises at intermediate @xmath143 ranges .",
    "these features are described well by jetset , but less well by herwig or the simple nbd and lnd .",
    "in addition to studies of the natural flavour mix , light and heavy quark initiated events have been investigated separately  @xcite .",
    "a large quark mass reduces phase space and shields the the collinear singularity associated with forward gluon emission , causing a relative suppression of forward hadrons  @xcite . in practice observation of the reduction in associated multiplicity due to this ` dead cone '",
    "@xcite is hampered by the presence of the heavy hadron s decay tracks ( @xmath170 per b - hadron  @xcite ) which actually ensure a higher multiplicity than in u , d , s events .",
    "however the difference in multiplicity is predicted  @xcite and seen to be @xmath30 independent  @xcite .",
    "( a variation of 0.4 tracks is expected from the change in the heavy quark fraction between 12 ( @xmath171 ) and 91 ( z@xmath0 ) gev  @xcite ; this is below the level of the experimental errors ) .",
    "implicit in the above calculations of event features , including those by monte carlo methods , is the assumption that pqcd provides the dominant contribution .",
    "this is especially true for infrared ( soft gluon ) sensitive quantities . in other words hadronization and resonance",
    "decays causes little disruption of the features already established by the cascade . in the absence of a well developed theory of hadronization",
    "this is in fact a minimum requirement for pqcd calculations to be worthwhile . in terms of the earlier space - time picture , described in subsection [ sxtpic ] , this idea of ` soft confinement ' appears very natural and it is indeed in many instances supported by data  @xcite . since in this picture",
    "it is the relatively soft _ gluers _ , following in the wake of the hard quarks and gluons , which cause hadronization to occur , then except for a ` collective ' action by the _ gluers _ , large momentum transfers during hadronization are precluded .",
    "an important observation which allows this picture to be taken further is that after a coherent shower , hadronization should occur locally .",
    "this is seen by considering two separating perturbative partons , with opening angle @xmath53 , and two _ gluers _ each emitted at @xmath172 to their parent partons  @xcite . at the time the two _ gluers _ simultaneously hadronize , their transverse and longitudinal separations are given by : @xmath173 here the inequalities follow from the strong angular ordering condition @xmath174  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the hadronizing _",
    "gluers _ form only a rather low density system in configuration space .",
    "the large inter-_gluer _ separations effectively limit the influence which one hadronizing parton system can have on a neighbour .",
    "this locality hypothesis also receives strong support from the pre - confinement property of pqcd  @xcite ( see ) .    in this scenario",
    "the local , and essentially independent , nature of each parton s hadronization leaves little scope for long - range effects .",
    "therefore hadronization should not significantly alter an event s angular structure or its energy and multiplicity distributions or their correlations , but only provide a ` correction ' .",
    "it is beyond this approach to predict actual production rates of specific hadrons ; however it would support the notion that these rates are essentially constants , dependent on at most a few nearest neighbour partons . to a certain extent",
    "present models do respect this idea and it is the quantum numbers of a few nearby partons which determine the properties of a produced hadron .",
    "this in turn gives rise to an approximate local conservation of flavour , baryon number etc .",
    "this idea has become known as local parton - hadron duality and represents perhaps the simplest working hypothesis for the effects of hadronization .",
    "experimental results on ` hard event properties ' clearly indicate that the concept contains a grain of truth but also that it is manifestly untenable at the level of ` one parton one hadron ' .",
    "its failure should be interpreted as a need for a less trivial , non - perturbative model of hadronization . a more specific , technical definition of lphd in terms of the limiting momentum spectrum ( @xmath159 )  @xcite was encountered in and will be discussed further in .",
    "so far it has been argued that the parton to hadron transition should occur locally in space - time , only involving a few neighbouring partons , and that local parton - hadron duality provides a reasonable summary of its effects on perturbative event structures .",
    "however this does not mean that hadronization is simple in detail .",
    "in practice many factors influence the production of a specific hadron and a realistic description is presently feasible only within the context of stochastic , non - perturbative models .",
    "independent fragmentation is perhaps the earliest framework for hadronization  @xcite , later becoming synonymous with the work of field and feynman  @xcite .",
    "as the name suggests , the hadronization of each individual parton is treated in isolation as a sequence of universal , iterative q@xmath175q@xmath176+h branchings based on the excitation of ( di)quark pairs .",

    "the iteration continues until a backward moving hadron would be produced ( @xmath191 ) or , in the case of cojets  @xcite , the sum of jet masses violates an available energy bound  @xcite .",
    "diquarks are treated just as quarks , whilst gluons are first split into a light q@xmath192 pair ( the momentum is shared equally in cojets ) and the above algorithm used but with retuned parameters .    typically a large cut - off value , @xmath193 gev , is used , resulting in only a few final - state partons .",
    "since these partons are treated in strict isolation , essentially ad hoc remedies must be used to ensure global conservation of quantum numbers . conserving four - momentum",

    "( it is only after gluon jets occur that differences become apparent ) .",
    "one can therefore speculate that a possible way to improve the situation is , after the forced gluon splitting , to apply the model to each neighbouring , colour singlet q@xmath194 pair in its own com frame just as to a pair of back - to - back jets .",

    "therefore it is reasonable to try to model the string dynamics on those of a ` massless ' , relativistic string possessing no transverse excitations .",

    "the full three - dimensional treatment of such a string system is rather complex , being characterized by the appearance of new string segments as intermediate gluons lose all their momentum to the system .",
    "however , robust , covariant evolution algorithms are available  @xcite , and whilst ambiguities exist they are largely confined to the matching at gluon ` corners ' .",
    "the classical equations of motion are also more complex , becoming non - linear when the end quarks are massive  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting at this point that the quantized theory of the idealized string has spawned a rich and still growing subject of its own  @xcite , which may still prove of relevance to the hadronization and confinement problems  @xcite .",

    "the rearrangement criterion is based on the space - time evolution of the strings . in model",
    "i the spatial overlap of ` wide ' flux tubes is used to assign probabilities for rearrangement , whilst in model ii rearrangement occurs at the first crossing of the ` narrow ' vortex lines .",
    "todorova s model  @xcite is an elaboration of the original model  @xcite , allowing for multiple reconnections , including within a single colour singlet system , and self - interactions ; this leads to string loops  glueballs .    as yet these models",
    "have not been thoroughly investigated , nor their consequences for z@xmath0 decays found . note that when including colour rearrangement the monte carlos must first be retuned : for example reducing the @xmath342-measure also lowers the average multiplicity , which must be compensated . since the physics of colour rearrangement is universal in nature ,",
    "effects should also be anticipated in all other types of hadronic interactions , including for example b - hadron decays ( b@xmath344 ) and rapidity gap events  @xcite , where important constraints may be found .",
    "the lep machine , a 27  km circumference storage ring , was conceived and constructed primarily as a z@xmath0 factory . in the lep 1 mode , running at and near the z@xmath0 peak , a luminosity of @xmath345  @xmath346s@xmath2 could be obtained , with beam lifetimes of up to 20 hours . until 1992 ,",

    "the centre - of - mass energy was scanned across the z@xmath0 peak to allow studies of the z@xmath0 line shape and other tests of the electroweak theory .",
    "unlike lep , the slc is a single pass collider , with the electron and positron bunches lost after each pass .",
    "the bunch crossing frequency , 120  hz , is therefore very much lower than at lep .",
    "the slc is however capable of providing electron beams with large polarization . in order to increase the luminosity ,",
    "the beams are tightly squeezed before the collisions to reduce their cross sectional area .",
    "this technically difficult procedure results in a beam spot of diameter 0.5  @xmath125 m in the vertical plane and 2.3@xmath125 m horizontally .",

    "the slc luminosity has steadily improved to around @xmath347  @xmath348s@xmath2 , and electron beam polarization values of 80% are now routinely achieved .",
    "both lep 1 and slc could provide their host experiments with clean , low background , experimental conditions .",
    "in addition , the relatively low beam crossing rates allowed the experiments to implement bias - free triggers and to collect data with essentially no dead time . for studies of multihadron production at the z@xmath0 peak ,",
    "initial - state radiation is negligible .",
    "multihadronic z@xmath0 decay events could be triggered with efficiencies greater than 99% and selected offline with backgrounds ( mainly due to @xmath349 lepton pair production ) of less than 1% .",

    "a large , active tracking volume within a strong magnetic field allows reconstruction of jets of charged particles and of secondary vertices from strange particle decays ; good track momentum and direction measurement give accurate reconstruction of systems of two or more particles ; charged particle identification permits the study of inclusive identified hadrons ; electromagnetic calorimetry allows measurement of inclusive @xmath103 and @xmath293 mesons ; and precision secondary vertex reconstruction and inclusive electron and muon identification may be used to identify charm and beauty particles .",

    "does not fit as well as version 5.8 , but a new default set of parameters will no doubt follow careful comparisons with data .",
    "it is clear from the various jetset tunings suggested by the four lep experiments in  @xcite that there are strong correlations among the program s parameters , possibly such that there is no unique best set . to this extent jetset",
    "may be underconstrained despite the large number of experimental measurements .",
    "delphi have published  @xcite comprehensive sets of tuned parameters for various monte carlo models ( including ariadne and jetset with matrix elements as well as with parton showers ) in which they take account of event shape variables as well as inclusive identified particle rates .",
    "this exercise is useful but probably premature .",
    "some of the recent measurements differ significantly from those used in the tuning , and many have much reduced errors . for example",
    "the @xmath466 baryon is now known to be produced at a much lower rate than previously measured , and it turns out the delphi tuned rate fits better with this new rate than with the one used as input ; the same is true of the @xmath407 meson rate .",
    "all of the models considered in  @xcite describe the inclusive rates reasonably well , with the exception of the performance of herwig in the baryon sector .",
    "although the available meson measurements are predominantly of the @xmath341 pseudoscalar and vector states , the presence of the @xmath248 mesons shows clearly their importance in the hadronization ; this is confirmed also in the baryon sector with the observation by opal of the @xmath449 .",
    "other scalar , axial vector and tensor mesons , together with orbitally excited baryons , must presumably also be produced , although large widths and small branching ratios will make them difficult to measure .",
    "many of the lighter particles are therefore decay products of other hadrons , and care has to be taken in any interpretation of the data using only relative light particle rates .",
    "so far only herwig 5.9 includes by default the p and some d wave meson states , and as the tables show their inclusion does not mar the agreement with data in the u , d sector",
    ". however herwig does poorly with mesons containing s quarks as well as with baryons .",
    "the production of the light tensor mesons is discussed by delphi in  @xcite where a comparison is made of relative rates of tensor to corresponding vector mesons .",
    "while the production ratio f@xmath470 is similar to that for f@xmath471 , at about 20% , there is evidence for a lower k@xmath472/k@xmath429 ratio , in agreement with results from hadroproduction experiments .",
    "this suggests an extra suppression of strange tensor mesons .",
    "however opal  @xcite measures a larger rate for k@xmath472 and so the picture is not yet clear . some evidence has also been reported  @xcite for a rise in the ratio f@xmath470 with meson momentum ; in other words the fragmentation function of the tensor meson may be harder than that of the vector meson , as generally expected of heavier hadrons  @xcite .",

    "but again the measurements are difficult , and other studies  @xcite of the inclusive @xmath96 mass spectrum with higher statistics have failed to report a measurement of the f@xmath404 because of systematic uncertainties .",

    "this results in the production of spatially compact ` novel vacuum scalars ' , identified with the f@xmath404 , which are expected to be produced in relative isolation .",
    "particular signatures include enhanced production at central rapidities ( with respect to the thrust axis ) and in low multiplicity events  @xcite .    from a semiclassical point of view",
    ", the orbital angular momentum @xmath479 of a  pair from string fragmentation is given by @xmath480 where @xmath481 is the mean quark momentum transverse to the string and @xmath482 is the size of the resulting hadron  @xcite .",
    "typical values give @xmath483 so that the rate for mesons with non - zero orbital angular momentum is expected to be less than about 10% of the rate for the corresonding l=0 mesons .",
    "the large average quark - antiquark separation in radially excited states also works to prevent production of these mesons in string fragmentation .",
    "although the @xmath248 mesons can be simulated in jetset at the correct rates by the adjustment of appropriate parameters , the large experimental rates are nevertheless a problem for the basic model assumptions about production of hadrons from strings .",

    "there is a large number of ways to determine , from the data , values for @xmath484 , the quark - level strangeness suppression assumed in the string model .",
    "results are tabulated for example in  @xcite where all measurements agree on a value of 0.3 , a result which accords with reasonable values for the strange quark mass  @xcite and the string energy density @xmath272 . since the various methods in  @xcite use both light and heavy quark states",
    ", this consistency suggests that the suppression occurs at the quark level , in agreement with the string - model assumption . on the other hand",
    "the ucla model also reproduces reasonably well the strange particle rates , and previous versions of herwig have been tuned to do so . and hadronization studies in ep collisions at hera",
    "@xcite give a lower value of @xmath485 , in apparent disagreement with the z@xmath0 decay measurements .",
    "therefore it is fair to say that the data are not yet conclusive .",
    "a direct method to measure the strangeness suppression in  has been proposed  @xcite which makes use of the electroweak forward - backward asymmetry and which could possibly distinguish between quark - level and hadron - level suppression .",
    "recently sld  @xcite have applied this method to their data on inclusive k@xmath486 and @xmath487 production using 150k events , with the result @xmath488 .      in the absence of mass effects , the ratio of direct pseudoscalar to vector meson production may depend simply on spin statistics , in which case the value p/(p+v ) would be expected to be 3/4 . however feed - down from decays is also important and may obscure the interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "one approach to determine the underlying p/(p+v ) value is to tune the appropriate parameter in the jetset model , but this can only be done within the limited knowledge available on production of the higher states .",
    "alternatively , one can use the measurements in the b and c sectors where vector to pseudoscalar mass differences are much smaller and there are some hopes to measure the orbitally excited states . the average ratio for primary b@xmath429/(b+b@xmath429 )",
    "is found to be @xmath489  @xcite , in excellent agreement with simple spin counting .",
    "however the picture is not so clear when charm is considered : here the ratio d@xmath429/(d+d@xmath429 ) is measured  @xcite to be @xmath490 .",
    "the difficulty here arises from incomplete knowledge of the production rate and decay modes of the orbitally excited d@xmath491 states which are likely to feed down into the d and d@xmath429 production .",
    "the question then arises as to why b@xmath491 production does not similarly muddy the waters in the b sector ; it may be that production and decay rates of the four different @xmath337 states of b@xmath491 conspire to leave the value of p/(p+v ) at 3/4 .",
    "more measurements are needed before definite conclusions can be reached .      in the string model ,",
    "baryon yields are determined by many parameters .",
    "the overall baryon rates relative to mesons depend on the relative probability to produce a diquark pair from the sea .",
    "spin-1 diquarks may be suppressed relative to spin-0 diquarks .",
    "the strangeness suppression enters in a similar way as for meson production , but there is in addition the possibility of extra suppression of strangeness in a diquark . and the popcorn mechanism may introduce one or more mesons locally in phase space between a baryon and an antibaryon",
    ".    although jetset does rather well , there are some discrepancies with measured rates .",
    "attempts by opal  @xcite to tune the parameters which control baryon production have shown that it is not possible to reproduce simultaneously all of the measured rates .",
    "the suggestion then is that the mechanisms for baryon production in the string model , and particularly for the strangeness suppression , are deficient .",
    "however , as has been said , there is now clear experimental evidence also for orbitally excited states in baryon production .",
    "the rate for the @xmath492 @xmath449 , at 0.02 per hadronic z@xmath0 decay , is around 5% of that for the @xmath493 @xmath121 .",
    "and there are many similar baryon states which can not be measured experimentally but which , it is fair to assume , must be produced in the hadronization .",
    "so since jetset , like all of the other models , does not include production of orbitally excited baryons , no clear conclusions can yet be reached .",
    "neither herwig nor ucla , both of which rely only on phase space , mass and spin , are successful in the strange baryon sector , with the former consistently overestimating the rates , and the latter underestimating them .",
    "as presently implemented , baryon production in herwig does not take account of the appropriate su(6 ) clebsch - gordon coefficients and this will lead to an overestimation of baryon production rates . as with jetset ,",
    "neither of these models includes the production of baryons other than the lowest lying @xmath341 states . in principle",
    "their inclusion would lower the predicted rates for primary low lying baryons , since some higher states would be produced in their stead .",
    "however there would be a compensatory increase in the rates due to feed down from decays .",
    "since herwig consistently overproduces and ucla underproduces the baryons , it seems reasonable to deduce that at least one of them is incapable of being fixed up by this mechanism .",
    "the conclusion then from the baryon yields is that the string model of jetset , while certainly not perfect , is in reasonable accord with the measurements .",
    "recent work on the baryon production within the popcorn model has further improved the agreement  @xcite . whether or not this is to be taken as a strong endorsement of the model is however an arguable point , given the large amount of freedom available to tune parameters in order to reproduce the observations .",
    "both the herwig cluster model and the ucla string model are clearly in difficulty , and it remains to be seen whether they can be rescued .      a number of models have been proposed to treat only the overall yields of identified particles .",
    "such models are necessarily of limited physical content , although they turn out to be reasonably successful in describing the inclusive rates .",
    "why they do so is not at all clear .    in the thermodynamic model  @xcite the source of particles is assumed to be a hadron gas in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the model has three parameters , a temperature , a volume and a parameter to allow for incomplete strange chemical equilibrium ( similar to the strangeness suppression of the lund string model ) .",
    "the model gives a good fit to the lep data , as well as to lower energy  annihilation data , with a temperature of around 170  mev , close to @xmath494 and the temperature found in the earlier statistical model of hagedorn  @xcite .",
    "the author of the model speculates that the thermal equilibrium could be a feature of the quark - hadron transition , brought about by strong interactions .",
    "this argument was also invoked by fermi  @xcite to justify his phase space model for hadron production .",
    "however it is difficult to reconcile this picture with the conventional view of hadronization in  annihilation as occuring locally in the wake of rapidly separating colour sources .",
    "a `` striking regularity ''  @xcite has been noted in the particle yields , and a simple formula proposed which reproduces well the observations ( apart from the pions and possibly the @xmath466 baryon ) : @xmath495 . here , @xmath251 is the yield for a particle of spin @xmath326 and mass @xmath496 , and @xmath497 is the isospin for baryons and a `` modified '' isospin for k and k * mesons and isosinglet pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the introduction of the `` modified '' isospin appears rather ad hoc , although there are plausible arguments to justify it .",
    "the model makes no attempt to explain the yield differences between members of the same isomultiplet which , for example , are significant for kaons .",
    "the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath114 are fitted to the data , and the slope parameter @xmath114 , at about 3.9  gev@xmath498 , is found to be the same for lep as for lower energy measurements , implying that the regularity may be universal . it is unclear as to the physical origin of the expression , and it will be interesting to see how the formula copes with future measurements .",
    "this observed regularity has a less successful predecessor of the form @xmath499",
    "@xcite , which was applied to lower energy data .",
    "another model  @xcite of the total yields is based on string fragmentation , and proposes a simple formula with only three parameters : a strangeness suppression , an effective temperature and a relative normalization factor between mesons and baryons . following the string model ,",
    "the rate @xmath251 of light meson and baryon production is taken as @xmath500 .",
    "the normalization @xmath136 depends on the centre - of - mass energy , @xmath501 is a relative suppression of baryons , @xmath326 is the particle spin , @xmath502 gives the suppression for a hadron containing @xmath503 strange quarks , @xmath504 is the hadron binding energy and @xmath135 is the effective temperature .",
    "the model gives a good simultaneous fit to lep and lower energy data , with a temperature of @xmath505  mev and a strangeness suppression @xmath484 of @xmath506 .",
    "the model also gives a good description of heavy flavour production .",
    "its predictions for production rates of excited charm states have recently been shown to agree with opal measurements  @xcite .      due to their narrow widths and the availability of clean leptonic decay channels the principle heavy quarkonium states measured are the @xmath507 and @xmath335(1s , 2s,3s ) , based upon which",
    "further excitations can be reconstructed  @xcite .",
    "the production of these heavy q@xmath508 bound states is thought to be rather atypical of hadron production in general , especially for the @xmath335 , due to the significant part played by perturbative physics .    in the case of charmonium",
    "the dominant production mechanism is expected to be weak b hadron decays : b@xmath153c@xmath509s ) plus subsequent colour rearrangement . in the case of b@xmath510 mesons the j@xmath511 branching ratios ( @xmath5121.15% )",

    "all of the above prompt production mechanisms give comparatively isolated quarkonia originating from the interaction point , in contrast to charmonium from b decays . here",
    "the b@xmath515 system is produced in a colour singlet state by the emission of perturbative gluons .",
    "the dominant process is quark fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "however the theoretical predictions are significantly low compared to the z@xmath0 data . also no evidence for displaced vertices , associated with additional heavy quarks ,",

    "a summary of measured values of @xmath342 and @xmath72 is given in table  7 .",
    "it is not straightforward to compare the various results , nor to interpret the findings .",
    "for example , in order to measure the enhancement @xmath651 due to becs it is necessary to know the phase space density in their absence , and there are several ways to tackle this . in addition particles which arise from resonance or weak decays may be removed ( if the detector has the capability )",
    ". the bec effect will be diluted in data samples containing mixtures of different particle types , and the purity of pion or kaon samples may be increased , depending again on the capabilities of the detector . in the lep analyses , various different approaches to these problems have been used .",
    "nevertheless , in all cases it is clear that the model based on a spherical source with gaussian density gives a reasonable fit to the observations , although there is no real evidence that other models would not fit equally well .",
    "the coherence parameter @xmath342 varies from close to zero to greater than one ; the latter is unphysical and possibly indicates deviations from the model .",
    "the source has a typical size of 1  fm , which at first sight seems inconsistent with a picture of hadrons arising from a rapidly expanding linear colour string .",
    "however the length scale measured by the becs is not the longitudinal size of the string , but the distance in production points for which particles are close together in momentum space  @xcite .",
    "recently bec studies at lep have been extended to three - particle systems  @xcite , and the multiplicity dependence of the correlations has been investigated  @xcite .    even if all of the measurements had been made in a consistent way , the interpretation of the results would not be straightforward : the correlations depend in a poorly understood way on final - state interactions , resonance production and rescattering of resonance decay products .",
    "according to  @xcite the situation may be `` impossibly complicated '' .",
    "and  @xcite says `` it seems very difficult to make progress in studying the bose - einstein effect in the context of  physics , and it is not clear to what extent it can be considered a useful and interesting activity . ''",
    "it is nevertheless important to understand at least the phenomenology of the bose einstein correlations since they impact on studies of other features of hadronic systems .",
    "for example , although the effect primarily influences systems of identical bosons , in the relatively high - multiplicity , jet - like environment of z@xmath0 decay , `` residual '' correlations  @xcite arise between pairs of unlike particles .",
    "the becs produce a general collimation of the jets and a tendency to reduce the mean transverse momentum ; this brings all particles closer together in momentum space .",
    "the effect is to produce a distortion of @xmath96 mass spectra , especially at low momentum where the multiplicity is highest .",
    "this means for example that the use of opposite charge particle pairs to determine the phase space in the absence of becs can result in biased values of @xmath342 and @xmath72 .",
    "an important practical result of the residual correlations is the considerable difficulty in inclusive measurements of @xmath96 resonances  @xcite such as the @xmath397 and the f@xmath652 whose line shapes are distorted by the correlations and possibly also by other mechanisms  @xcite .    in the process  at lep 2",
    ", correlations may arise between the hadrons from one w and those from the other , an effect recently investigated by delphi  @xcite .",
    "such an effect could result in a shift of the reconstructed w mass in multihadronic w decays  @xcite .",
    "a good understanding of the role of becs in hadronization at the z@xmath0 may help to reduce uncertainties introduced by this effect .",
    "while becs between identical bosons are firmly established experimentally , anticorrelations between identical fermions are more difficult to observe . in z@xmath0 decay",
    ", baryons are produced at much lower rates than mesons , and local conservation of baryon number suppresses production of identical baryons close together in phase space .",
    "the only evidence for anticorrelations comes from a study by opal  @xcite of @xmath653 , @xmath654  @xmath654 and @xmath655 pair production .",
    "close to threshold it is found the the spin states of the di - hyperon systems agree with expectations of a simple statistical mixture , with no indication of any resonance in the @xmath655 threshold enhancement . in the case of the identical baryon pairs",
    ", there is a tentative indication of suppression close to threshold , as would be expected by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "however , further measurements are needed to confirm this result .      since baryons , and strange hadrons , are both heavier and less frequently of secondary origin than ordinary hadrons investigating their production and pairwise correlations appears to offer a more direct probe of the momentum and quantum number flow during hadronization .",
    "however , allowance must always be made for secondary hadrons coming from decays , such as @xmath656 ( here further data  @xcite on @xmath657 correlations would be welcome ) .",
    "baryon number conservation implies that a baryon is always accompanied by an antibaryon ; flavour conservation , via diquark pairs , suggests that the baryons may be preferentially particle - antiparticle pairs ; and lphd argues that these baryons occur close by in phase space .",
    "so far , studies have concentrated on measuring the proximity in phase space of  @xcite ,  @xcite and @xmath657  @xcite baryon pairs . by introducing an event axis , typically the thrust or sphericity axis ,",
    "correlations can be studied in rapidity , azimuthal angle or polar angle with respect to the axis .",
    "several models of baryon production are available  @xcite .",
    "discusses the independent fragmentation  @xcite , the diquark  @xcite and popcorn  @xcite ( triplet ) string options and the cluster  @xcite models .",
    "in addition a possible contibution from direct , @xmath658 , diquark production has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "also there is the recombination model of hadron production  @xcite . in this approach",
    "a spectrum of partons occuring after a shower at the fixed scale @xmath659 is convoluted with an explicit wavefunction for a particular hadron . in the case of a baryon",
    "@xcite this gives ( c.f .",
    "): @xmath660 here a typical wavefunction is @xmath661 , consistent with reciprocity  @xcite and quark counting rules  @xcite , and on the assumption of uncorrelated partons @xmath662 .",
    "it may be mentioned in passing that the recombination model makes interesting predictions for baryon polarizations  @xcite .      at the z@xmath0",
    "strong , short - range correlations in rapidity are seen between baryon - antibaryon b@xmath663 pairs .",
    "( unlike - baryon distributions have the like - baryon ( bb ) distributions subtracted to remove secondary correlations due to more than one b@xmath307 pair in an event . ) for example , the distribution of baryon rapidity ( @xmath143 ) in such events , @xmath664 , is measured to be compact and centred on @xmath665  @xcite . in a b@xmath307 pair , given the rapidity of the @xmath666 there is @xmath667% probability that the p ( @xmath121 ) will be found within @xmath668 and vice versa  @xcite ; a marginally weaker short - range @xmath669 correlation is found  @xcite .",
    "a much weaker long - range anticorrelation is also seen for far forward / backward b@xmath307 pairs , as anticipated from a leading particle effect .",
    "in contrast , when bb pairs occur in an event , the @xmath670 distribution is nearly flat with just a weak short - range anticorrelation , particularly so away from the central region  @xcite where phase space constraints become important .",
    "similar , though statistically limited , results have been seen at lower energy  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively these features are reproduced by both the herwig and jetset models , though quantitatively the strength of the correlations is overestimated by herwig and by jetset without popcorn  @xcite .",
    "the recombination model predicts rapidity correlations which are much too weak whilst direct diquark production predicts long - range correlations that are too strong ; both are disfavoured by the data  @xcite .",
    "somewhat weaker correlations are seen between the azimuthal angles in baryon pairs at the z@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "b@xmath307 pairs show a tendency towards @xmath671 , though in those pairs which lie out of the event plane there is a tendency towards @xmath672 .",
    "bb pairs show a weaker tendency towards @xmath672 .",
    "two competing mechanisms might be envisaged to explain the azimuthal angle correlations .",
    "first is a local compensation of transverse momentum which leads to an enhancement for @xmath672 .",
    "second is a tendency for any off - axis boost to be shared by neighbouring baryons , leading to an enhancement at @xmath671 .",
    "the latter effect might be expected to become more important at higher energies where three - jet effects come into play ( these by definition involve higher transverse momentum scales than hadronization ) , more so for baryons lying in the event plane . at low com energy",
    "( 10  gev ) the first , back - to - back , effect appears to dominate  @xcite but this is seen to weaken at higher energy ( 30  gev )  @xcite and at the z@xmath0 the second , side - by - side , effect is more important .",
    "historically a very powerful way to discriminate between hadronization models is the orientation of the b@xmath307 pair with respect to the event axis  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath5 is the angle between the axis of the b@xmath307 pair and the event axis as seen in the b@xmath307 pair rest frame then @xmath673 is measured to be highly forward - backward peaked  @xcite . by utilizing the lepton beam polarization information ( see section [ selwk ] ) sld are capable of determining the primary quark direction and have recently been able to demonstrate that the baryon preferentially follows the quark direction  @xcite .    in string models",
    "the colour field typically aligns along the event axis , so that provided that the transverse momenta acquired by the baryons are small compared to the longitudinal momenta transferred from the string , the baryons will retain a strong memory of the string / event axis direction .",
    "in contrast , because clusters are deemed to be structureless , they have no means of retaining any information about an original event axis ( they are unpolarized ) and so decay isotropically in their rest frame .",
    "not surprisingly then the highly peaked @xmath673 strongly disfavours the essentially flat prediction from herwig whilst jetset offers a good description of the data . in herwig version 5.7",
    "an option was introduced to allow non - isotropic decays of clusters containing primary quarks ; this was implemented to stiffen the momentum spectrum of c and b hadrons and has little influence on b@xmath307 pair polar angle distributions .      in the previous section , [ sbcor ] ,",
    "phase space correlations were discussed for baryons ; we now turn to similar measurements made on strange hadrons .",
    "the conservation of strangeness in strong interactions implies that strange hadrons are pair - produced during hadronization . the probability that hadron @xmath674 is accompanied by @xmath675",
    "is defined as @xmath676 where the 2 is included because of double counting .",
    "measurements give @xmath677% whilst @xmath678%  @xcite , @xmath679% and @xmath680%  @xcite , @xmath681%  @xcite and @xmath682%  @xcite .",
    "two sources of strange hadrons can be anticipated : leading hadrons associated with initial s@xmath683 quarks and those pair - produced locally in the event s colour field . to help distinguish these possibilities",
    "requires information on the phase - space correlations between pairs of strange hadrons .",
    "a short - range rapidity correlation occurs between @xmath684 pairs and a slightly weaker one between @xmath685 pairs  @xcite indicating a local mechanism for strangeness compensation .",
    "also visible are : weaker long - range correlations , as expected from leading quarks ; and evidence of phase - space suppression , particularly when both hadrons are leading .",
    "weak correlations are also seen at @xmath686 for centrally produced @xmath684 and @xmath685 pairs .    the possible influence of introducing the popcorn baryon production mechanism , see , is of particular interest for string models .",
    "the presence of an intermediate meson , bm@xmath307 tends to soften all correlations . at present , taking account of systematic errors , measurements of baryon and strangeness correlations are insufficient to place any significant constraint on the level of popcorn production required .",
    "the b@xmath307 pair rapidity difference is mainly sensitive to the amount of popcorn production , with data favouring a substantial component  @xcite .",
    "the substantial rate of @xmath687 pair production also favours a high level of popcorn production in order to supply an intermediate kaon  @xcite .",
    "interestingly the number of b@xmath688 pairs decreases linearly with the amount of popcorn introduced so that their measured multiplicity can be ( rather simplistically ) used to constrain the amount of popcorn to around 50%  @xcite .",
    "a more direct test of the popcorn mechanism is to look at rapidity ordered bm@xmath307 triples  @xcite .",
    "using nearby baryon pairs , @xmath689 , a probability of 7% ( 25% ) is obtained for finding an intervening kaon ( pion ) in a  or @xmath669 pair .",
    "in addition to there being no enhancement of popcorn - favoured @xmath121k@xmath690 triples , unfavoured @xmath121k@xmath691 triples are found equally likely .",
    "however , in events containing a kaon and a close @xmath121p pair , the kaon is found very close in rapidity to the baryon pair .",
    "intermittency  @xcite , the non - random clustering of particles in phase space , is a somewhat obscure phenomenon of uncertain dynamical origin .",
    "in essence , intermittency corresponds with large , non - statistical , fluctuations in the numbers of particles in particular events which are found in narrow rapidity bins .",
    "it is normally studied by measuring factorial moments of multiplicity distributions in rapidity bins .",
    "intermittent behaviour has been observed in hadronic systems from z@xmath0 decay at both lep  @xcite and slc  @xcite as well as in lower energy  collisions .",
    "the intermittency observed in hadronic z@xmath0 decays is in fact reproduced by the lund parton shower monte carlo model with string fragmentation .",
    "it is a possibility that the self - similarity inherent in the qcd parton shower , with its successive q@xmath619qg and g@xmath619gg branchings , is the source of the intermittency seen in the distribution of the final - state hadrons .",
    "certainly the jetset model contains no feature explicitly introduced to simulate the dynamics of intermittency .",
    "the appearance of intermittency in the z@xmath0 decay data would seem to be an ideal opportunity to gain a good understanding of the mechanisms which lie behind it .",
    "previously its interpretation in hadroproduction experiments has been obscured by the complicated nature of the final states and the effects of beam and target fragments .",
    "the determining property of quark and gluon jets is the colour charge of the initiator partons , @xmath692 and @xmath693 respectively . due to the gluon s larger",
    "charge it should radiate more subsequent gluons in a parton shower .",
    "this leads to the anticipation that gluon jets , as compared to quark jets , will have : a higher multiplicity , softer momentum spectrum and wider angular distribution  @xcite .",
    "these global features are largely borne out by experimental results  @xcite .",
    "however whilst clear differences are now established between gluon and light - quark jets , b - jets appear to be rather like gluon jets at z@xmath0 energies  @xcite ; the ratios of measured properties typically fall short of the naive asymptotic predictions . for example",
    "the multiplicity ratio is , in leading order , predicted to be @xmath694  @xcite ; at nnlo this becomes @xmath695  @xcite and after imposing energy ( but not momentum ) conservation on the shower this drops to @xmath696  @xcite ( the exact predictions depend on jet energy and the scale used for @xmath41 ) .",
    "the measured ratio , which is seen to be sensitive to the precise jet definition , is typically in the range @xmath697 , though opal has obtained 1.55 in an event hemisphere - based analysis  @xcite .",
    "it should be borne in mind that the these basic predictions are made for back - to - back pairs of quark or gluon jets whilst growing evidence suggests that the relative topology of a jet is important in determining the appropriate scale  @xcite .",
    "the above discussion relates to the perturbative properties of quark and gluon jets .",
    "current cluster and string models of hadronization make no distinction between whether a set of final - state partons arose from a fragmenting primary quark or gluon ; they are treated the same .",
    "this does allow the possibility of a ` leading particle ' effect ( for example one should expect more leading kaons in an s - quark jet than a gluon jet ) but no other ` anomalous ' effects  @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility is that some isoscalar states , @xmath698 , may contain a significant gg component and hence might appear more frequently as leading particles in gluon jets .",
    "these particles are very often primary hadrons coming directly from a cluster or string . at present the possibility of hadrons containing gluons",
    "is not allowed for and only quark constituents are considered . indeed in the cluster framework",
    "gluons are split into light  pairs whilst in the string approach they represent energy - momentum ` kinks ' on a string . however modifying the models to accommodate gluonium",
    "would not , _ a priori _ , appear to pose significant problems of principle or practice .",
    "a more radical scenario is offered by the independent fragmentation model of peterson and walsh  @xcite .",
    "this is based on the suggestion that a gluon is attached to an octet colour flux tube and quarks to triplet flux tubes ( see ) .",
    "a gluon now fragments into a sequence of isoscalar gg or gq@xmath192 g clusters leading to a prediction of greatly enhanced @xmath699 etc production and harder momentum spectra as compared to quark jets .",
    "a third alternative scenario for gluon jet hadronization is provided within the recombination model  @xcite discussed in .",
    "calculations predict : a softer pion spectrum  @xcite , an enhanced multiplicity ratio @xmath700  @xcite and enhanced baryon production  @xcite in gluon jets compared to quark jets .",
    "the l3 collaboration have reported tentative indications that @xmath293 production is enhanced in gluon jets  @xcite .",
    "studying the lowest energy  gluon  jet in three - jet events they see a a harder @xmath293 momentum spectrum than predicted by both the herwig and jetset monte carlos with an enhancement in the ratio @xmath701 .",
    "the use of a ratio takes into account the established increase in multiplicity found in gluon compared to quark jets and is designed to make the measurement sensitive to any additional enhancement or suppression .",
    "the monte carlos provide a satisfactory description of the spectrum and @xmath702 ratio in quark jets .",
    "delphi have studied the production rates of kaons , @xmath703 and @xmath704 in multi - jet events  @xcite .",
    "they find that the relative yields of strange hadrons in multi - jet , normalized to two - jet , events is constant in events with widely separated jets but favours increased production in multi - jet events at small resolutions , particularly so for kaons . in a more direct study delphi",
    "have looked at identified particle production rates in actual quark ( natural flavour mix ) and gluon jets , normalized to the charged multiplicity in the jet : the double ratios @xmath705  @xcite .",
    "the evidence suggests values for the double ratios of approximately @xmath706 for the k@xmath0 , @xmath707 for k@xmath3 , @xmath708 for p and @xmath709 for @xmath121 .",
    "in general these results are in qualitative agreement with the monte carlos but quantitatively the deviations from unity are larger than typically predicted , apart for the k@xmath0 result where a small suppression was expected .",
    "however the errors are relatively large .",
    "opal have also reported preliminary studies of the double ratios  @xcite . for k@xmath365 and @xmath352 mesons",
    "they report a slight , @xmath710% , increase in the relative production rates in gluon jets , whilst for p and @xmath121 baryons they measure a significant 3040% increase .",
    "these enhanced production rates are presumably at the expense of pion production . at present",
    "more measurements are required before hard conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the possibility of enhanced identified hadron production in gluon as compared to quark jets has received previous attention .",
    "the results for mesons , in particular hard @xmath293 relative to @xmath103 , production are not conclusive . at @xmath711",
    "gev argus  @xcite saw no evidence for enhanced @xmath293 or @xmath352 production in the continuum , @xmath712q@xmath192 .",
    "also comparison has been made between continuum and @xmath713ggg events ; here crystal ball  @xcite see no enhancement whilst dasp - ii , cleo and argus  @xcite see a slight enhancement for a number of mesons . at @xmath714 gev jade  @xcite",
    "reported very weak ( statistically insignificant ) evidence for a small enhancement in the @xmath702 ratio in acollinear , gluon rich , events .",
    "the situation is clearer for baryons .",
    "the production rate of baryons in @xmath715 decay ( gluon dominated ) to continuum ( quark dominated ) events shows an excess of 200300%  @xcite .    in the context of conventional monte carlos a number of partial explanations",
    "have been offered .",
    "a study using jetset indicates that the relative production rates of mesons in quark and gluon jets is energy independent and just less than one , whilst for baryons it is 2025% larger and shows a slight increase with jet energy  @xcite .",
    "this latter effect may be attributed to an edge effect associated with the suppression of leading baryons . in cluster models",
    "it has been argued that in gluon rich environments , the topology , rather than any intrinsic properties of the jets , leads to heavier clusters and hence larger baryon production rates  @xcite . at the @xmath335",
    "it has also been emphasized  @xcite that secondary decays are important , and that 40% of the events are in the continuum to b and c quarks ( see ) which , being heavy , ` eat up ' the available phase space for baryon production .",
    "that monte carlo event generators , solidly based on sound physics , are essential in modern high energy experiments , from detector conception to data analysis , ought not to be forgotten .",
    "it therefore almost goes without saying that the reliability of monte carlo predictions should be a prime concern if only for mere practical reasons . to this",
    "end the large event rates and pristine conditions available in hadronic z@xmath0 decays at  colliders play a particularly important role . here , as nowhere else , the physics assumption built into the monte carlo models can be confronted with ever more exacting tests .",
    "the relatively complex conditions associated with initial - state hadrons have largely precluded this activity using ep and p@xmath716 data , thereby making physicists reliant on the quality of the z@xmath0 data .",
    "two caveats to the wider application of the models are the questions of the reliability of the factorization theorem in perturbative qcd and the presumption of universality in the hadronization process .",
    "focusing on the models for the hadronization processes one may ask what is left that should be done with the z@xmath0 data and what might be learned from it .",
    "we list a number of topics , perhaps not all of which can be done with available data ( but one can always hope for more z@xmath0 data ) :    * a study of the transverse momentum distributions of identified particles , especially pions where low mass effects and correlations may occur  @xcite  in string models the fact that the predicted width of the gaussian @xmath230-distribution , @xmath717 , proves too narrow has raised questions about the adequacy of a tunnelling mechanism explanation : is unresolved ( non - perturbative ) gluon emission  @xcite the real explanation ? * an attempt to establish properties of the relatively rare , directly produced pions  pions are special particles by virtue of their nature as goldstone bosons ( of the chiral symmetry ) ; this mandates them to have small masses which in a string model implies a very small size , in fact uniquely less than a string s width .",
    "* further measurements of orbitally excited mesons and baryons  are the production rates for these states too high to be compatible with the string model ? * a search for d - wave states , such as the k@xmath718  these could help elucidate the role of the wavefunction in determining a hadron s production rate . * a study of f@xmath404 production as a function of rapidity and of total event multiplicity  this would test the gribov confinement scenario  @xcite . * a search for deuterium production  this has been reported previously in studies at the @xmath335  @xcite and is expected , on the basis of a string model calculation  @xcite , at the level of @xmath719 per hadronic z@xmath0 event . * further measurements of strangeness suppression ( @xmath484 ) which ideally can be directly compared to those available in ep collisions , particularly those associated with the current region of the breit frame  @xcite  if it turns out that @xmath720 then effort should go to establishing any other differences . * a measurement of the s - quark to p and @xmath721 fragmentation functions",
    " is there a measurable difference as suggested  @xcite by the possible asymmetry in sea quark structure functions ?",
    "* measurements of identified particle production rates in quark and gluon jets  are there measurable differences and , if so , what is the mechanism ? * a search for glueball candidates , particularly in the gluon - rich environment provided by gluon jets . * further measurements of leading baryon polarization",
    " is there a depolarizing mechanism for the b baryons which does not apply to those arising from s quark fragmentation ?",
    "* measurements of the helicity density matrix for the light and heavy vector mesons  does hadronization produce spin - aligned vector mesons , and does any alignment depend on @xmath50 ? are some off - diagonal elements non - zero as predicted by coherent hadronization ?",
    "spin physics has a long history of producing surprises . * more detailed studies of intermittency",
    " can it be firmly established that the phenomenon is due to the self - similar evolution of the initial  state via a qcd parton shower ? * a search for direct evidence of popcorn - type baryon production via , for example , further study of @xmath121k@xmath313 type correlations  three - body cluster decays would also induce such correlations but perhaps with different intensity . * a search for @xmath722 type correlations",
    " these are possible in a generalized popcorn mechanism although they will be hard to find experimentally because of low rates .",
    "* an attempt to establish directly the existence of the ` dead cone ' @xcite in non - leading particles , by removing the leading particles using fully reconstructed b - hadron decays . * direct measurement of the rates and momentum spectra of hadrons produced in b - quark events to ensure adequate descriptions of the weak decays in the monte carlos  b hadrons contribute a tenth of all particles in hadronic z@xmath0 decays , and significantly more at large @xmath50 . *",
    "a tuning of the monte carlo models to z@xmath0 data , incorporating colour rearrangement  this is important in order to determine the effects of colour rearrangement and to provide constraints which may prove significant for later w mass measurements . * a simultaneous tuning of the monte carlo programs to the z@xmath0 data and lower energy data , particularly from pep and petra",
    " at lower energies the relative contribution to event properties made by hadronization is more important , whilst the influence of the perturbative shower can be tested using the com energy dependence of observables . * an ` ultimate ' tuning of the monte carlo models to the final z@xmath0 data  this will be an invaluable service to experimentalists and theorists allowing the experience gained from lep1/slc to be applied at future machines . * a continuation of the search for tests which discriminate between the competing models of the non - perturbative physics underlying the hadronization , and continuing development of these models .    in summary ,",
    "the  data have already provided a wealth of information on the phenomena of parton hadronization .",
    "of the available models of the non - perturbative physics involved , the lund string model , as implemented in jetset , has met with most success , particularly in the baryon sector , and most notably in its prediction of the angular distribution of correlated baryon - antibaryon pairs in their rest frame . however , the model has many free parameters and consequently has little predictive power .",
    "but the parameters are not arbitrary  most are based on incomplete knowledge of physics .",
    "therefore it could be argued that their values , when fully tuned to reproduce observations , provide important information about hadronic physics . on the other hand , while the weight of evidence tends to favour the string picture , the other models , particularly the cluster model of herwig , are not dead , and more analyses of the existing and future data are essential to provide further discrimination between the models and to help elucidate the physics of hadronization .",
