    "standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been extensively tested by experiments at cern , fermilab tevatron and elsewhere .",
    "these experimental results confirm the @xmath2 gauge structure of the sm .",
    "measurement of gauge boson couplings to fermions provide us important data for the determination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 couplings .",
    "the charged lepton couplings to z boson have been measured with a sensitivity of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however z boson couplings to individual neutrinos have not been tested with comparably good accuracy .",
    "for example , the experimental limits on @xmath6 and @xmath7 couplings to z are approximately 100 times worse than @xmath8 and @xmath9 couplings to z @xcite .",
    "universality of the coupling of neutrinos to z is another assumption of the sm which has not been tested with a good accuracy .",
    "this assumption simply states that @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath10 couple with the same strength to z at the tree - level .",
    "many parameters of the sm have been very precisely tested at , for example , cern @xmath11 collider lep . at lep ,",
    "couplings of neutrinos to z are constrained by the invisible z width which receives contributions from all neutrino flavors .",
    "therefore it is impossible to discern possible universality violating neutrino z couplings from the lep data .",
    "it is possible to constrain new physics contributions to @xmath0 that respect universality .",
    "recent limits on these contributions are @xcite @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe possible deviations from the sm coming from new physics .",
    "they modify neutrino neutral current as @xcite @xmath14\\bar{\\nu}_i\\gamma_\\mu \\nu_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these new physics contributions respect universality if the equality @xmath15 holds .",
    "charm ii collaboration obtained data on @xmath16 scattering . these data",
    "together with lep results place the limit @xcite latexmath:[\\ ] ] we studied @xmath1 c.l .",
    "bounds using two - parameter @xmath79 analysis with a systematic error of the same order as the statistical one .",
    "the @xmath79 function is given by , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the cross section containing new physics effects and @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath83 is the statistical error and @xmath84 is the systematic error .",
    "number of events is taken to be @xmath85 which is compatible with the number of events studied at ref .",
    "we re - parametrize the couplings as @xmath86 thus possible non - zero values of the couplings @xmath87 or @xmath88 implies universality violation between interactions @xmath52 and @xmath89 : any modification of the sm @xmath52 and @xmath89 couplings that respect universality is described by @xmath90 ( or equivalently by @xmath91 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , and [ fig4 ] we show @xmath1 c.l . allowed regions for the parameter spaces @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we also show the limit ( area bounded by dotted lines ) obtained from inequality ( 3 ) .",
    "we see from this figure that limit obtained from the charm ii data is approximately 6 times weaker than our limits",
    ".    nusong experiment will also provide high statistics @xmath7 deep inelastic scattering from the nuclei in glass .",
    "the expected number of events for @xmath7 neutral current deep inelastic scattering is @xmath95 @xcite . in comparison nutev had @xmath96 deep inelastic scattering events in neutrino mode @xcite .",
    "therefore nusong will provide two orders of magnitude more events .",
    "since quark couplings to z are not modified by operators ( 6,7 ) hadron tensor does not receive any contribution .",
    "it is defined by the standard form @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the nucleon momentum , @xmath99 is the momentum of z propagator , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 the structure functions are defined as follows @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the weak charges and quark distribution functions of the ith quark flavor . in our calculations",
    "parton distribution functions of martin , roberts , stirling and thorne ( mrst2004 ) @xcite have been used .",
    "we assume an isoscalar nucleus @xmath107 .",
    "this would be good assumption if the glass target is pure @xmath108 .",
    "natural silicon is 92.2% @xmath109si , 4.7% @xmath110si , and 3.1% @xmath111si , where only @xmath110si is not isoscalar @xcite .",
    "naturally occurring oxygen is 99.8% @xmath112o . hence the error incurred by assuming",
    "an isoscalar target would be not more than a few percent .",
    "possible new physics contributions coming from the operators in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) only modify the lepton tensor : @xmath113 where , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the momenta of initial and final state neutrinos .",
    "therefore @xmath7 neutral current deep inelastic scattering isolates the couplings @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it does not receive any contribution from @xmath62 and @xmath63 . as we have discussed",
    "this is not the case in @xmath116 .",
    "the behavior of the integrated total cross section as a function of initial neutrino energy is plotted for various values of anomalous couplings in fig .",
    "we see from the figure that cross section has a linear energy dependence in the energy interval @xmath117 gev .",
    "deviation of the anomalous cross sections from their sm value increase as the energy increases .",
    "therefore high energy neutrino experiments are expected to reach a high sensitivity to probe these anomalous couplings .    in fig.[fig6 ]",
    "we show @xmath1 c.l .",
    "sensitivity bounds on the parameter space @xmath94 for nusong and nutev statistics .",
    "we observe from the figure that nusong has approximately 10 times more sensitive bounds than nutev for @xmath118 scattering .",
    "neutral current deep inelastic scattering limits can be combined with @xmath48 limits to place bounds on universality violating parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 . combining results of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we obtain the bound @xmath119 @xmath120 . similarly combining fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we obtain the bound @xmath121 @xmath122 .",
    "these bounds can be compared with charm limits . from the first inequality of ( 5 ) we obtain @xmath123 for @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "therefore @xmath48 and @xmath118 scattering processes at nusong provide approximately 40 times more restricted limits for @xmath88 and @xmath87 compared with charm limits .",
    "in some schemes new physics neutrinos participate may be observable at lower energies , such as neutrino scattering through an unparticle exchange @xcite",
    ". however , to probe most of the neutrino interactions beyond the standard model would require energetic neutrino beams such as those employed in the nusong proposal or beta - beam proposals @xcite .",
    "in this paper we explored signatures for deviation from flavor universality in neutrino - z boson couplings .",
    "we found that the proposed nusong experiment can place approximately an order of magnitude better limits than the charm experiment in the muon - neutrino electron scattering mode .",
    "we have also shown that deep - inelastic scattering measurements with nusong can place an almost two orders of magnitude better limits on universality breaking than previous measurements .",
    "thus coupled with possible complementary measurements of electron neutrino - electron scattering cross section at beta beam experiments @xcite nusong experiment can be a powerful probe of new neutrino physics .",
