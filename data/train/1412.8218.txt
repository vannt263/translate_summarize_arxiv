    "the yang  mills gradient flow or the wilson flow  @xcite is a powerful method to construct renormalized composite operators in gauge theory ( see  ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that a local product of bare fields evolved by the gradient flow possesses quite simple renormalization properties  @xcite : the multiplicative renormalization factor of the local product is determined simply by the number of fermion ( or generally matter ) fields contained in the local product ; the flowed gauge field requires no multiplicative renormalization .",
    "furthermore , no infinite subtraction is needed .",
    "since such a renormalized operator is independent of regularization ( after the parameter renormalization ) , the gradient flow is expected to be quite useful in relating physical quantities in continuum field theory and operators in lattice theory .    on the basis of this very general idea , a possible method to construct the energy ",

    "as well recognized  @xcite , the construction of the energy  momentum tensor on the lattice is quite involved because lattice regularization breaks the translational invariance . the intention of  refs .",
    "@xcite is that the constructed lattice energy  momentum tensor restores the correct normalization and the conservation law automatically in the continuum limit .    the construction in  refs .",
    "@xcite is based on very natural assumptions , such as the existence of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor and the renormalizability of the gradient flow in the non - perturbative level .",
    "also , the validity of the construction has been tested for thermodynamic quantities in quenched qcd by using a monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for updated numerical results .",
    "however , whether the conservation law is really restored in the non - perturbative level is still to be carefully examined .    under these situations , it must be instructive to consider a simpler system that would allow a similar construction of the lattice energy  momentum tensor . mainly with this motivation ,",
    "the gradient flow for the 2d @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model was investigated in  ref .",
    "@xcite ; an identical flow equation has also been studied in  ref .",
    "@xcite . in  ref .",
    "@xcite , it was proven to all orders of perturbation theory that the @xmath2-vector field evolved by the gradient flow requires no multiplicative renormalization , a quite analogous property to the 4d gauge field .",
    "because of this renormalizability of the gradient flow and because of the asymptotic freedom , one can imitate the construction of the lattice energy ",
