    "lattice simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) predict that qcd undergoes a phase transformation at a temperature @xmath0 mev @xcite from a confined hadronic phase to a phase , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in which quarks and gluons constitute the relevant degrees of freedom and the chiral condensate vanishes . experimentally",
    ", this prediction can only be tested in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . however , finding evidence , and ultimately proof , for the creation of a quark - gluon plasma faces several difficulties .",
    "arguably the greatest challenge is to link experimental observables to quantities measured on the lattice .    for a large set of observables ,",
    "the evolution of the expanding medium is a key ingredient for their theoretical description .",
    "it is also the place where results from lattice qcd fit in : assuming a thermalized system is created , its evolution is governed by the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "hence , in order to test the lattice qcd predictions , one has to start with this assumption and show that it leads to a good description of the experimental data . in the following , we will demonstrate that this is indeed possible by introducing a parametrized evolution model .",
    "assuming that an equilibrated system is created a proper time of order 0.5 - 1 fm / c after the onset of the collision , we make the ansatz @xmath1 for the entropy density @xmath2 at given proper time @xmath3 as measured in a frame co - moving with a given volume element , @xmath4 the spacetime rapidity and @xmath5 two functions describing the shape of the distribution and @xmath6 a normalization factor .",
    "we use woods - saxon distributions @xmath7\\right)\\ ] ] and @xmath8\\right).\\ ] ] for the shapes .",
    "thus , the ingredients of the model are the skin thickness parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the parametrizations of the expansion of the spatial extensions @xmath11 as a function of proper time . from the distribution of entropy density",
    ", the thermodynamics can be inferred via the eos ( as obtained in lattice calculations ) and the particle emission function is then calculated using the cooper - frye formula for a freeze - out hypersurface characterized by a temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the total entropy is an input parameter whereas the entropy density carried by the different hadronic degrees of freedom is calculated in a statistical hadronization framework .",
    "the model is described in greater detail in @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the model is that it does not require boost invariance but allows for an accelerated longitudinal expansion pattern instead with initial rapidity @xmath13 not equal to final rapidity @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that in general the spacetime rapidity @xmath15 at some point is not equal to the rapidity @xmath16 , rather there s a non - trivial relation dependent on the trajectory leading to this point . in most relevant cases , however , the relation can be approximated by @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "such initial longitudinal compression and re - expansion implies longer lifetime and higher initial temperature and energy density as compared to a bjorken scenario .",
    "the adjustible parameters of the model are freeze - out temperature @xmath12 , the radial expansion velocity @xmath18 , the initial longitudinal expansion rapidity @xmath13 and the skin thickness parameters @xmath19 .",
    "in the following , we only focus on central collisions .",
    "the model parameters are fitted to the recent sps data for 158 agev pb - pb collisions obtained by na49 and ceres @xcite and 200 agev au - au collision data obtained by the phenix collaboration at rhic @xcite . the data for both sps and rhic favour a comparatively low freeze - out temperature of order 100 - 110 mev and a strong transverse flow ( @xmath20 at sps and @xmath21 at rhic ) .",
    "in both cases , the initial rapidity inverval is found to be significantly smaller than the finally observed rapidity interval @xmath14 , we find @xmath22 , @xmath23 at sps and @xmath24 at rhic .",
    "this is a crucial ingredient for the successful description of the data and the numbers indicate that the actual dynamics of the system could be very different from a bjorken expansion .",
    "the resulting transverse mass ( @xmath25 ) spectra for different hadron species and the pionic hanbury - brown twiss ( hbt ) correlation radii show good agreement with the data ( figs .",
    "[ f - spec ] , [ f - hbt ] and [ f - hbt_rhic ] ) .    there is a contribution to the @xmath26 @xmath25-spectra coming from the vacuum decay of resonances after kineitc decoupling at @xmath27 . the model is able to calculate the magnitude of this contribution using statistical hadronization but not its @xmath25 distribution , therefore it is left out when we compare with data .",
    "this explains the mismatch at low @xmath25 and that the integrated spectrum does not yield the multiplicity indicated by the data .",
    "the same is visible in the k@xmath28 spectra and the nucleon spectra , albeit less pronounced .",
    "for the emission rate of direct photons , we use the complete @xmath29 calculation @xcite in the form of the parameterization provided in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of emitted photons can be found by folding the rate @xcite with the fireball evolution . in order to account for flow ,",
    "the energy of a photon emitted with momentum @xmath30 has to be evaluated in the local rest frame of matter , giving rise to a product @xmath31 with @xmath32 the local flow profile . for comparison with the measured photon spectrum @xcite , we present the differential emission spectrum into the midrapidity slice @xmath33 . the resulting photon spectrum is shown in fig .  [ f - em ] ( left ) . details of the calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lepton pair emission rate from a hot domain populated by particles in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath34 is proportional to the imaginary part of the spin - averaged photon self - energy , with these particles as intermediate states .",
    "the thermally excited particles annihilate to yield a time - like virtual photon with four - momentum @xmath35 which decays subsequently into a lepton - antilepton pair .",
    "the information about the strong interaction dynamics is encoded in the spectral function which enters the emission rate . for its computation",
    ", we have to use different techniques for dealing with partonic and hadronic degrees of freedom . in the partonic phase",
    ", we use a leading order calculation using thermal quasiparticles as degrees of freedom . in the hadronic phase we calculate in two different approaches to estimate the theoretical uncertainty - a chiral model @xcite and a mean - field model @xcite .",
    "the resulting invariant mass spectrum agrees with the measured data for both the chiral model and the mean field model of hadronic matter . for sps , we find photons in the momentum range between 2 - 3 gev to be dominated by thermal emission from an initial high - temperature partonic phase whereas the dilepton yield in the invariant mass region below 1 gev is dominated by emission from hadronic matter .",
    "both quantities are sensitive to the 4-volume of radiating matter and complement each other in supporting the fireball evolution model in its different evolution phases .",
    "most notably , the dilepton result indicates that hadronic matter does not cease to interact after the phase transition , instead substantial modifications of the @xmath36 properties in medium are required by the data . the photon spectrum can not be reproduced in a bjorken expansion , thus confirming the findings outlined above based on an analysis of hadronic observables .",
    "the sensitivity of the yield to the equilibration time @xmath37 allows to obtain @xmath38 fm / c @xcite .    for rhic , we find that the contribution to the photon spectrum coming from hadronic matter is as large as the yield from partonic matter due to the strong flow .",
    "this is unfortunate , as it reduces the capability of a photon measurement to help in the determination of the peak temperature reached in the collision @xcite . in both calculations , a pre - equilibrium contribution to the photon yield is missing .",
    "such a contribution is expected to be most relevant for the high momentum region and to dominate the yield above 3 - 4 gev .",
    "charmonia yields are calculated by solving rate equations for the interaction of the state with the medium . the initial condition for the rate equations",
    "is determined by comparing to the production in p - p and p - a collisions . for sps conditions ,",
    "dissociation of the state dominates and we find the equation    @xmath39    for the rapidity density @xmath40 as a function of proper time @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the medium density @xcite . folding this equation with the fireball evolution yields fig .",
    "[ f - charm ] .",
    "we find good agreement with the data with the exception of the high @xmath43 region where fluctuations in the transverse energy ( not included in the model ) are relavent and in the low @xmath43 region where the system can not be expected to be thermalized any more .",
    "we have presented a thermal description of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at the cern sps for 158 agev pb - pb which is highly consistent and leads to a good description of a large set of different observable quantities . while this does not provide a conclusive proof for the creation of a thermalized system ( and hence a qgp ) , it constitutes certainly strong evidence for it .",
    "it remains to be investigated if the results can be reproduced in a thermal microscopical transport description ( like hydrodynamics ) and if a non - thermal framework is able to describe the experimental results as well or if thermalization is required by the data .    for rhic ,",
    "we have presented a fireball evolution model which is able to simultaneously describe both hbt correlations and transverse mass spectra .",
    "this parametrized evolution model will hopefully be able to guide hydrodynamical models ( which currently fail to provide such a simultaneous description ) .",
    "we are now in the process of making predictions for other observables based on this evolution model .",
