    "colloid dispersions are systems of great interest in several areas , because of their complex behavior and their many technological applications .",
    "their phase behavior depends in a sensitive way on the range of the colloid - colloid attraction relative to the colloid size . in the presence of very short - range interactions",
    "only fluid - solid coexistence occurs , as is the case for the hard - sphere fluid . as the range of the attraction is increased , a fluid - fluid transition can also occur .",
    "the addition of nonadsorbing neutral polymers to a colloidal dispersion provides an easy method to modify in a controlled fashion the range of the attractive effective force between the colloids , hence it allows one to modify at will the phase behavior of the system . for dispersions of spherical colloids and ( sufficiently long ) nonadsorbing neutral polymers in an organic solvent ,",
    "phase behavior depends @xcite to a large extent only on the nature of the solvent and on the ratio @xmath7 , where @xmath3 is the zero - density radius of gyration of the polymer and @xmath4 is the radius of the colloid .",
    "if @xmath8 is smaller than a critical value @xmath9 , only fluid - solid coexistence occurs , while in the opposite case there is also a fluid - fluid coexistence of a colloid - rich , polymer - poor phase ( colloid liquid ) with a colloid - poor , polymer - rich phase ( colloid gas ) .",
    "extensive theoretical and experimental work predict @xcite @xmath10 - 0.4 for polymers under good - solvent conditions .",
    "several approaches have been used to determine the phase diagram of colloid - polymer mixtures .",
    "on one side , several approximate thermodynamic approaches have been used .",
    "we mention the prism approach , @xcite density functional theory , @xcite and thermodynamic perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite another successful approach is free - volume theory@xcite which has been originally developed for mixtures of colloids and ideal polymers and later generalized to include polymer - polymer and polymer - colloid interactions.@xcite such an approach appears to be quite accurate@xcite as long as @xmath1 .",
    "numerical simulations of colloid - polymer systems have also been performed .",
    "simulations using full - monomer representations of the polymers @xcite are difficult , because of the large number of degrees of freedom involved . as a consequence ,",
    "the simulated chains are typically relatively short .",
    "this implies that results are affected by significant corrections to scaling , which must be taken into account before comparing them with experimental data or with results obtained in other approaches ( see ref .   for a discussion ) . to avoid these difficulties , coarse - grained ( cg ) approaches",
    "have been developed .",
    "in these models , short - scale degrees of freedom of the polymer subsystem are integrated out , providing a simpler representation of the polymers that still allows one to obtain accurate results for the thermodynamics of the system and for large - scale ( i.e. , on length scales comparable to the polymer size ) structural properties in some range of densities and of polymer - to - colloid size ratios . beside the obvious advantage from the computational side ,",
    "cg models are also very convenient since they provide directly thermodynamics and structural properties in the universal , scaling limit without requiring additional extrapolations . for this purpose",
    "it is enough to determine the target properties on which the cg model is built in the scaling limit .",
    "several cg models have been introduced for polymer solutions in different concentration regimes .",
    "@xcite in the simplest approaches ( single - blob representations ) , one maps polymer chains onto point particles interacting by means of spherically symmetric potentials .",
    "@xcite in the good - solvent regime , models with density - independent potentials , i.e. , obtained at zero polymer density , reproduce the thermodynamic behavior of polymer solutions up to polymer volume fractions @xmath11 of order 1 ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the polymer number density and @xmath14 is the volume ) , i.e. , as long as polymer - polymer overlaps are rare , so that the neglected many - body interactions@xcite are not relevant .",
    "these simple models have been extended to include polymer - colloid interactions . @xcite for colloid - polymer systems , these approaches are generically expected to be predictive only in the colloid regime @xmath1 . indeed , for @xmath15",
    ", corresponding to @xmath16 , the polymer can wrap around the colloid , making the monoatomic ( single - blob ) approximation for the polymers unrealistic .",
    "single - blob models with potentials dependent on the polymer density have also been considered.@xcite such models , by definition , reproduce some large - scale properties of the system for all values of @xmath11 in the limit of zero colloidal density . in this approach",
    ", however , there are several sources of ambiguity .",
    "first , potentials do not only depend on the state point one considers , but also on the chosen ensemble,@xcite i.e. , on the thermodynamic variable ( for instance , the density or the chemical potential ) chosen to specify the thermodynamic state point .",
    "moreover , also the determination of the thermodynamic properties is ambiguous , since different approaches , which are equivalent for systems with state - independent interactions , provide different results for the same quantity.@xcite since potentials are not allowed to depend on the colloidal density @xmath17 , for finite @xmath17 this approach only provides an approximation to the correct behavior , with the same limitations of the simpler zero - density single - blob approach . in particular , also this class of single - blob models is expected to be predictive only for @xmath1 .",
    "these limitations can be overcome by switching to a model at a lower level of coarse graining : a long polymer chain is mapped onto a short chain of @xmath0 soft monomers ( blobs).@xcite for purely polymeric systems , these cg models predict the correct thermodynamic and large - scale structural properties of the solution as long as blob overlaps are rare .",
    "@xcite in the semidilute regime this condition is satisfied for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the zero - density blob radius of gyration and @xmath20 is the de gennes correlation length , which is the only relevant length scale in the semidilute regime .",
    "since@xcite @xmath21 and @xcite @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the flory exponent ( @xmath25 , see ref .  ) , the condition @xmath18 is equivalent to @xmath26 under good - solvent conditions .",
    "therefore , by increasing the number @xmath0 of blobs , the cg model becomes predictive in a larger density interval .",
    "analogously , in the presence of colloids , the pairwise approximation in which many - body interactions are neglected only holds if @xmath27 , i.e. , for @xmath28 .",
    "this condition guarantees that the average distance between two colloids is larger than @xmath19 and that , therefore , only pair interactions are relevant . again , by increasing the number @xmath0 of blobs we can extend the validity of cg models to larger values of @xmath8 .",
    "recently , we have introduced a procedure to set up a hierarchy of cg models for linear polymer chains under good - solvent conditions which simultaneously reproduce quite accurately structure and thermodynamics of polymer solutions deep into the semidilute regime.@xcite we followed the structure - based route @xcite ( an alternative , conceptually different approach is the force - matching route , discussed , e.g. , in refs .  ) , in which the cg model is set up in such a way to reproduce full - monomer correlation functions of a set of chosen structural collective variables , which are determined at zero polymer density .",
    "since simulations of a few isolated polymer chains are relatively easy , we were able to obtain the target correlation functions for polymer chains of several lengths with high numerical precision .",
    "therefore , we could perform a reliable extrapolation to obtain target properties in the scaling , universal limit .",
    "this guarantees that the cg model gives thermodynamical and structural predictions in the scaling limit , which can directly be compared with experiments on high - molecular - weight polymers .    in the minimal model",
    "each linear chain is represented by a short polyatomic molecule with four sites ( tetramer ) .",
    "the tetramer potentials are set up at zero density  this allows us to avoid the inconsistencies@xcite that occur when using state - dependent potentials  by matching the single - chain intramolecular structure and the center - of - mass pair correlation function between two identical chains .",
    "this minimal representation has been shown to provide accurate results for the underlying solutions up to @xmath29.@xcite higher - resolution models with @xmath30 are obtained by using a simple transferability approach , which allows one to obtain the interaction potentials for @xmath0 blob systems starting from those computed for the tetramer .",
    "this transferability approximation , extensively discussed in sec .",
    "v.a of ref .  , was shown to be quite accurate@xcite and allowed us to obtain precise thermodynamic and ( large - scale ) structural results for @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , the multiblob cg models predict the isothermal compressibility with an error of less then 10% up to @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 for @xmath6 and up to @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "in this paper we extend the multiblob approach to colloid - polymer mixtures .",
    "colloids are modelled as hard spheres of radius @xmath4 , while a multiblob model is used for polymers .",
    "first , we consider the case in which each polymer is represented by a four - blob ( tetramer ) cg molecule .",
    "the resulting cg model , in which polymer - colloid interactions are simply approximated by pair potentials between the blobs and the hard sphere , works quite well up to @xmath37 in the homogeneous phase and represents a significant improvement with respect to the single - blob case .",
    "then , we extend the model to @xmath30 by using a simple transferability argument , analogous to that presented in ref .  .",
    "to validate the model , we compare the numerical data obtained by using the cg models with full - monomer simulation results for @xmath38 , 1 , and 2 . beside being of relevance for the test of the cg model",
    ", these simulations also provide new results for the intermolecular and intramolecular structure in a colloidal dispersion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we define our basic cg model in which each polymer is represented by a four - blob ( tetramer ) cg molecule . in sections",
    "[ sec3 ] , [ sec4 ] , and [ sec5 ] we determine the accuracy with which the tetramer model reproduces the behavior of the polymer - colloid mixture .",
    "first , we consider the third virial coefficients , that allow us to estimate how large the neglected three - body effects are.@xcite then , we consider the behavior of a single colloid in a bath of polymers . in sec .  [ sec5 ]",
    "we present full - monomer results in the homogeneous phase for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath5 .",
    "we determine several thermodynamic quantities , which are then compared with the corresponding tetramer results . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] we consider the transferability in the number of blobs , determining a decamer model , which is validated by using the full - monomer results derived in the preceding sections . in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] we discuss single - blob models with state - dependent interactions , generalizing that proposed in ref .  . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec8 ] we draw our conclusions . in app .",
    "[ appendix - kb ] we collect some formulae that are useful to determine some thermodynamic quantities from monte carlo estimates of the partial structure factors . in app .",
    "[ app.b ] we discuss the polymer and blob size in the homogeneous phase as a function of @xmath40 and @xmath11 . in app .",
    "[ app.c ] we explain how to determine state - dependent single - blob potentials in the grand - canonical ensemble by using integral - equation methods .",
    "details are collected in the supplementary material.@xcite we define the polymer model we use to compute full - monomer properties , we give interpolations of the colloid - blob potentials determined for the tetramer model ( for the pure polymer system , see the supplementary material of ref .  ) , and provide extensive tables of thermodynamic data in the homogeneous phase .",
    "in the multiblob approach one starts from a _ coarse - grained representation _ ( cgr ) of the underlying full - monomer model , which is obtained by mapping a chain of @xmath41 monomers onto a chain of @xmath0 blobs , each of them located at the center of mass of a subchain of @xmath42 monomers .",
    "if the monomer positions are given by @xmath43 , one first defines the blob positions @xmath44 as the centers of mass of the subchains of length @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 for the new cg chain @xmath47 one defines several intramolecular and intermolecular correlation functions , which are then used as target properties for the definition of the cg model .",
    "the cg model consists of polyatomic molecules of @xmath0 atoms located in @xmath48 .",
    "all length scales are expressed in terms of the full - monomer zero - density radius of gyration @xmath3 , hence all potentials and distribution functions depend on the adimensional combinations @xmath49 . as discussed in ref .",
    ", it is not feasible to reproduce exactly the structure of the full - monomer model , even at the cgr level , since this would require the introduction of complex many - body interactions .",
    "however , a judicious parametrization of the interactions in terms of pair potentials , each of them depending on a single scalar variable , works quite well.@xcite in this paper we apply the same strategy to polymer - colloid mixtures , determining the appropriate effective intermolecular interactions between polymer blobs and colloids . in the spirit of the multiblob approach",
    ", we neglect interactions among three or more molecules and consider only the interaction between a polymer and a colloid . in general , it depends on @xmath50 scalar variables , parametrizing the relative position of the blobs and of the colloid .",
    "the exact determination of this many - body potential is , of course , unfeasible in practice .",
    "therefore , we make a pair - potential approximation .",
    "the polymer - colloid interaction is completely specified by the blob - colloid pair potentials @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the blob index along the chain , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the colloid and blob positions , respectively .",
    "note that the potentials depend on @xmath8 , which is explicitly reported in the notation .    as in ref .  , we begin by considering the tetramer case @xmath56 . for this value of @xmath0",
    "there are two independent potentials @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "they are determined by requiring the cg model to reproduce the distribution functions @xmath59 between the center of mass of blob @xmath52 and the colloid , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 . for @xmath62",
    "a direct computation of the potentials is unfeasible , hence we will use a simple transferability approach as in ref .  .",
    "simulations have been performed at @xmath63 , as in our previous works .",
    "this value is optimal within errors .",
    "the optimal value @xmath64 at which the leading scaling corrections are absent was estimated in ref .  , obtaining @xmath65 .",
