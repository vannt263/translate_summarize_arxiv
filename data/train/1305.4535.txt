    "cosmological simulations have clearly established that galaxy collisions and mergers play major roles in the formation and evolution of galaxies by triggering a rapid mass build - up ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution major merger simulations have shown that the star formation physics is more dominated by mass fragmentation and turbulent motion across the merging disks , forming massive clumps of dense gas clouds ( @xmath14  m@xmath15 ) and triggering star formation across the galaxy disks @xcite , or in a dense filamentary structure along the merging interface @xcite . in some cases , radial streaming can efficiently feed the gas to the central black hole , possibly triggering an agn phase during the course of the galaxy merger evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an important observational test is to map the dense gas tracers in merging u / lirgs ( ultra luminous infrared galaxies ) since they show high degree of starburst activity , some of which harbor agns in their centers @xcite .",
    "the hcn  ( 43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) emission , whose critical densities are @xmath16  @xmath13 and @xmath17  @xmath13 @xcite respectively , are both reliable dense gas tracers and now readily accessible at sub arcsecond angular resolution with the advent of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) . here",
    "we present alma cycle 0 hcn  ( 43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) observations of an ir - bright galaxy vv114 with the primary goal to study the distribution of dense gas during the critical stage when the two gas rich galaxies collide and merge .",
    "vv114 is a gas - rich ( @xmath18 ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) interacting pair with high - infrared luminosity ( @xmath19 ) located at d = 86  mpc ( @xmath20  kpc ) .",
    "it consists of two optical galaxies ( vv114e and vv114w ) with a projected separation of 6  kpc ( figure  1 ) .",
    "evidence for wide - spread star formation activity and shocks across the entire system is found in the uv , optical , and mid - ir ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . a dust - obscured agn in vv114e is also suggested ( but not conclusive ) from nir @xcite and x - ray observations @xcite , suggesting that both starburst and agn activities might have been triggered by the ongoing merger .",
    "( 160mm,40mm)figure1_new_2.eps    the hcn  ( 43 ) ( @xmath21  ghz ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) ( @xmath22  ghz ) observations toward vv114 were obtained on june 1  3 , 2012 during the cycle 0 program of alma using the extended configuration .",
    "the digital correlator was configured with 0.488  mhz resolution for the spectral window that contains the emission lines .",
    "absolute flux calibration was performed using uranus , j1924 - 292 was used for bandpass calibration , and the time dependent gain calibration was performed using j0132 - 169 ( 6 degrees away from vv  114 ) .",
    "the total on source time was 86 minutes .",
    "we used the delivered calibrated data product and cleaned the image down to 1.5 sigma using the alma data reduction package casa .",
    "channel maps with 30 km  s@xmath4 velocity resolution were made , with a synthesized beam size of @xmath23 ( pa = 52 degrees)(equivalent to @xmath24  pc ) .",
    "the rms noise level was 0.9 mjy  beam@xmath4 for the robust=0.5 maps .",
    "the continuum was subtracted using all of the line - free channels in the bandpass .",
    "the hcn  ( 43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) integrated intensity maps are presented in figure  1 . while the hcn  ( 43 ) emission is only seen near the eastern nucleus of vv114 and resolved into four peaks , the hco@xmath1(43 ) emission is more extended and has at least 10 peaks in the integrated intensity map .",
    "the total integrated intensity of hco@xmath1(43 ) and hcn  ( 43 ) are @xmath25 jy  km  s@xmath4 and @xmath26 jy",
    "km  s@xmath4 , respectively . the higher hco@xmath1(43 ) flux observed by the sma ( @xmath27  mjy ; @xcite ) using a @xmath28 beam is likely attributed to missing flux by the alma observation .",
    "we show a direct comparison between the j=43 ( this work ) and j=10 ( taken at the nobeyama millimeter array ; @xcite ) transitions of both species in figure  2 , after convolving the alma images with the nma beam ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "while the j=43 transitions of both species are concentrated near the eastern near - infrared nucleus with a slight extension to the west for hco@xmath1  ( 43 ) , the distribution of the hcn  ( 10 ) and hco@xmath1  ( 10 ) are different ; the hcn  ( 10 ) emission is separated into two clumps in the east - west whereas the hco@xmath1  ( 10 ) emission is extended widely toward the western nucleus .",
    "we label the six hco@xmath1(43 ) peaks in the eastern part of vv114 as e0  e5 and the four detected in the western part of vv114 as w0 ",
    "w3 ( figure  1 , table  1 ) .",
    "the hco@xmath1(43 ) and hcn  ( 43 ) emission peaks are spatially consistent for e0  e3 . the compact component e0 is unresolved with the current resolution , and the size upper limit is @xmath2  pc .",
    "hcn  ( 43 ) emission is not detected in the overlap region ( w0  w2 ) , where the high co  ( 10 ) velocity dispersion and significant methanol detection both suggest the presence of shocked gas ( saito et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we present a comparison between the surface brightness of hco@xmath1(43 ) and hcn  ( 43 ) in figure  3 .",
    "although the statistics are limited , the three molecular clumps ( e1 , e2 and e3 ) show an increasing trend between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in contrast , the ratio between the beam averaged surface brightness of e0 is a factor of three higher than e1 , e2 and e3 ; e0 is the only component that has hcn  ( 43 ) ",
    "hco@xmath1(43 ) integrated flux ratio which is larger than unity ( hcn  ( 43)/hco@xmath1(43 ) = 1.6 ) .",
    "gaussian fits to the hco@xmath1(43 ) and hcn  ( 43 ) spectra at e0 give peak = 9.0  mjy , @xmath32  km  s@xmath4 ( for hcn  ( 43 ) ) and peak = 6.9  mjy , @xmath33  km  s@xmath4 ( for hco@xmath1(43 ) ) .",
    "thus the hcn  ( 43 ) emission is not only brighter at e0 , but it is also broader than the gas traced in hco@xmath1(43 ) , suggesting that the hcn  ( 43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) are tracing physically different gas at @xmath2  pc scales .",
    "such a high relative intensity of the hcn emission is possibly a signature of a buried agn , as suggested by previous studies   ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been known that the brightness of the hcn emission line is enhanced near the agn compared to star forming regions ( @xcite ) , with higher contrast in high j transitions ( @xcite ) .",
    "individual galaxies ( e.g. ngc  1068 , ngc  1097 ) have been studied extensively in high resolution ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , clearly revealing the over abundance of hcn emission near the seyfert nucleus , through j = 1 to 4 . the exact reasoning for the enhanced intensity ratio",
    "is not clearly understood , and it could be due to gas excitation effects ( e.g. density and temperature ) , intensity of the incident radiation field ( e.g. pdr vs. xdr ) , ir pumping ( e.g. @xcite ) , or other non - collisional excitation due to star formation or supernovae explosions ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . there is evidence suggesting the dominance of low density ( @xmath34  @xmath13 ) gas in a sample of agns @xcite , and hence the difference in critical density is likely not the only reason for the difference in the relative abundance .",
    "( 70mm,20mm)surface_densityv3.epsi    regardless of the exact physical origin of the higher relative intensity of the hcn  ( 43 ) emitting gas , the broad ( fwhm = 290  km  s@xmath4 ) and compact ( @xmath2  pc ) unresolved source e0 is of significant interest , since it coincides with the region where past observations suggest the presence of a buried agn .",
    "we derive the upper limit to the dynamical mass by using @xmath35 ( assuming an inclination of 90 degrees for simplicity ) , where @xmath36 is the radius enclosing the emission region , @xmath37 is the width of the hcn line , and @xmath38 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the upper limit to the dynamical mass estimated from the line - width and the beam size is @xmath5  m@xmath6 .",
    "since the hcn emission is generally believed to be optically thick , we estimate the dense gas mass of the e0 component adopting the conversion factor provided in @xcite . using the integrated intensity of hcn  ( 43 ) ( see section 3 ) and hcn  ( 10 ) = 7  jy  km  s@xmath4 @xcite",
    ", we derive hcn(43)/(10 ) = 0.63 .",
    "this yields a dense gas mass of @xmath39  m@xmath6 , hence @xmath40% of the total mass is in dense molecular form and significant amount of dense gas is present in a very compact region .",
    "finally , we note that while these are evidences suggesting a compact agn near the eastern nucleus of vv114 , the 350  ghz  8.5  ghz flux ratio suggests the contrary .",
    "the ratio is @xmath41 for e0 , and @xmath42 for e1 and e2 , using the the archival 8.5  ghz radio continuum image obtained from the vla archive ( beam size @xmath43 ) and the 350  ghz image obtained from the alma observations .",
    "the 350  ghz continuum emission is also unresolved at e0 , but e1 and e2 show resolved structure .",
    "if the dominant source of radio continuum emission is indeed due to hot plasma surrounding the agn , then we expect this ratio to be higher near the putative agn ( i.e. e0 ) , which is inconsistent with the current results and argues in favor of a common physical origin ( e.g. a massive starburst ) in all three regions .",
    "higher resolution radio continuum imaging is necessary to understand the origin of the radio emission in e0 .",
    "the average size of the clumps forming the filamentary structure ( i.e. e1e5 , w0w3 ) is @xmath44  pc , with an average dense gas mass of @xmath45  m@xmath6 and a mean projected separation of @xmath9  pc .",
    "we compare the distribution of the hco@xmath1(43 ) and star formation activity traced in pa@xmath10 line in figure  4 .",
    "spatial correspondence between hco@xmath1(43 ) and the brightest peaks of pa@xmath10 is generally seen .",
    "such a long filamentary dense gas structure and associated star formation are predicted along the colliding interface of two colliding galaxies @xcite , and the masses are also consistent with the massive star forming clumps predicted in simulations by @xcite .",
    "finally , we derive the global physical conditions of gas by comparing the total integrated hco@xmath1(43)/(10 ) and hcn(43)/(10 ) ratios to the results from radiative transfer modeling ( radex ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results are @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12  @xmath13 and t = 30  500  k , assuming abundance ratios of [ hco@xmath1]/[h@xmath47 = @xmath48 @xcite and [ hcn]/[hco@xmath1 ] = 0.1 to 1 ( to be consistent with m82 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the range in the derived temperature is too large to be a meaningful constraint , this suggests the presence of moderately dense gas averaged over the entire galaxy pair .",
    "we caution here that these are average quantities which are derived without considering the difference in the spatial distribution between the j=43 and 10 transitions ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "higher angular resolution imaging of the j=10 transition is clearly needed in order to determine the spatial distribution of the physical properties .",

    "we present @xmath49 resolution hcn  ( 43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) observations toward a mid - stage ir bright merger vv114 obtained during cycle 0 program of alma . for the first time , these new high - quality maps allow us to investigate the central regions of this merging lirg at 200  pc resolution . we find that both the hcn  ( 43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) emission in the eastern nucleus of vv  114 are compact ( @xmath2  pc ) and broad ( 290  km  s@xmath4 for hcn  ( 43 ) ) with high hcn  ( 43)/hco@xmath1(43 ) ratio . from the new alma observations along with past x - ray and nir observations , we suggest the presence of an obscured agn in the eastern nucleus of vv114 .",
