    "prominent features of qcd like confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath0sb ) are still not satisfactorily understood .",
    "one possibility to explore the non - perturbative regime of qcd is to employ dses , an infinite tower of coupled integral equations , see _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "their non - perturbative nature makes them an appropriate tool for exploring the low - energy domain of the theory .",
    "careful truncations have to be imposed on the system in order to evaluate the equations . in these proceedings",
    "we will extend a prior study of the quark - gluon vertex @xcite by systematically improving on the used truncation .",
    "the aim is to shed more light on a possible relation between confinement and d@xmath0sb by studying the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "the starting point is the system of equations for the quark propagator and the quark - gluon vertex in landau gauge using fits for the gluon propagator as input @xcite .",
    "the three - gluon vertex is modeled as in ref .",
    "the infrared suppression of the gluon propagator relates on the one hand to an infrared enhancement of the ghost propagator ( see _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and on the other hand to the positivity violation for transverse gluons .",
    "the latter property indicates the role of the transverse gluons in a non - perturbative brst quartet mechanism @xcite and therefore a certain aspect of gluon confinement : in landau gauge qcd transverse gluons are confined and therefore not confining .",
    "thus , given the infrared suppression of the gluon propagator , the quark - gluon vertex has to acquire a certain strength in the infrared to provide d@xmath0sb and , eventually , quark confinement . in ref .  @xcite it has been found that within the imposed truncation ( and at vanishing temperatures and densities ) d@xmath0sb and quark confinement occur either together in a self - consistent way or are both absent . by improving on the truncation of the quark - gluon vertex dse we hope to get deeper insights into the possible relation between quark confinement and d@xmath0sb .",
    "in addition , isolating important tensor structures of the quark - gluon vertex will likely lead to improved phenomenological applications . especially ,",
    "corresponding studies at non - vanishing temperatures and/or quark chemical potentials can benefit from a more detailed understanding of the quark - gluon vertex , see _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  @xcite .",
    "the coupled system of the quark propagator and the quark - gluon vertex is shown in fig .",
    "this system serves as a starting point for this study .        the vertex equation in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] has been derived from a 3pi effective action and corresponds to the dse truncated at three - point level @xcite .",
    "note that as usual in an npi - based approach all vertices are dressed .",
    "for obvious reasons , the last two diagrams on the right - hand side of the vertex equation are referred to as the _ non - abelian _ and the _ abelian _ diagram . upon performing the color",
    "traces one finds that the non - abelian diagram has a prefactor of @xmath1 , whereas the abelian diagram is suppressed by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "this suppression has been found to be even more severe due to the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "thus , as a first step to solve the system of the quark propagator and the quark - gluon vertex dse , only the non - abelian diagram has been taken into account .",
    "the system as depicted in figs .  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] has been considered as a first step towards the full solution of the system of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . within this approximation ,",
    "one vertex of the non - abelian diagram remains bare while the second is dressed such that the full vertex experiences feed - back from all twelve tensor structures .",
    "this vertex also enters the propagator equation fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the vacuum ,",
    "twelve tensor structures are needed as a basis to span the vertex . instead of employing the widely - used ball - chiu basis",
    "@xcite it turned out to be numerically advantageous to use a simpler basis given by @xmath3 } \\end{array}\\right\\}\\otimes\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c } \\gamma^\\mu\\\\ p_1^\\mu\\\\ p_2^\\mu \\end{array}\\right\\}\\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the in- and outgoing quark momenta .",
    "as input from the yang - mills sector the gluon propagator has been taken from earlier dse studies .",
    "the three - gluon vertex is represented by its tree - level tensor structure combined with the following ansatz @xcite @xmath6\\right)^{17/44}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the sum over the squared gluon momenta entering the vertex and @xmath8 .",
    "this ansatz reflects the strong ir enhancement known from yang - mills theory ( see , however , the remark in sect .",
    "3 ) as well as ensures the correct running in the uv region .",
    "the residual parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 have to be fixed to physical observables , e.g. the chiral condensate .      as a first step ,",
    "the dressing functions have to be disentangled to get them in an explicit form .",
    "since the employed basis is neither orthonormal nor orthogonal one obtains a linear system of equations for the vertex dressing functions in terms of the twelve right - hand side projections . this system can be solved in advance , giving rise to explicit expressions for the dressing functions as linear combinations of the right - hand side projections . in each iteration",
    "step these projections are evaluated numerically and are used subsequently to obtain the dressing functions by inserting them into the solution of the pre - calculated linear system of equations .",
    "the quark wave function renormalization constant @xmath12 , the mass renormalization constant @xmath13 as well as the quark - gluon vertex renormalization constant @xmath14 has been fixed within a mom scheme . in particular , the renormalization conditions for the quark dressing function @xmath15 and the tree - level vertex dressing function @xmath16 have been employed , where @xmath17gev@xmath18 denotes the renormalization scale .",
    "only the tree - level tensor @xmath19 has to be concerned in this procedure since all other tensor structures lead to uv finite expressions .",
    "@xmath13 has been fixed by the condition @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mass at the renormalization scale .",
    "the evaluation of the coupled system of the quark propagator and the quark - gluon vertex as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is numerically demanding .",
    "the actual calculations are thus performed on a cluster featuring graphics processing units ( gpus ) .",
    "gpus have already been applied successfully to solve dses @xcite .",
    "they will be vital once the full non - abelian diagram and/or the abelian diagram is taken into account .",
    "the system described in sec . [",
    "sec : a_first_step ] has been solved self - consistently , taking all twelve tensor structures for the quark - gluon vertex into account .",
    "[ fig4a ] shows the behaviour of the mass function @xmath22 as obtained from the quark propagator dressing functions in the chiral limit . due to stability issues it was not yet possible to take the full ir strength of the three - gluon vertex @xmath23 into account to @xmath24 resulting in moderate changes of the dynamical generated mass . ] .",
    "[ fig4b ] shows the vertex dressing function @xmath25 which corresponds to the tree - level structure @xmath19 evaluated at the symmetric point @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the significant ir enhancement seen in this function is also present in most other tensor structures , independent whether they have been generated by d@xmath0sb or are chirally symmetric .",
    "the coupled dses for the quark propagator and the quark - gluon vertex in landau gauge has been investigated .",
    "results for the quark propagator coupled to a partially dressed quark - gluon vertex including all twelve tensor structures have been presented .",
    "isolating the important tensor structures will become vital for subsequent calculations taking the full non - abelian as well as the abelian diagram into account , aiming towards a complete solution of the system as depicted in fig .",
