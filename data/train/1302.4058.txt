    "noncommutative geometry is founded on the allegory that noncommutative algebras should be studied as generalizations of algebras of functions over spaces endowed with some form of geometry , and finds its roots in the work of connes @xcite .",
    "noncommutative metric geometry , in particular , is the study of noncommutative generalizations of algebras of lipschitz functions over metric spaces @xcite . a fascinating consequence of the introduction of noncommutative metric data on c*-algebras , encoded in special seminorms called lip - norms , is the possibility to define topologies on the class of all quantum metric spaces . in turn ,",
    "such topologies establish a framework for new forms of approximations and the development of new techniques inspired , in large part , by the mathematical physics literature .",
    "moreover , this new framework allows for generalizations of techniques from metric geometry @xcite to the realm of quantum spaces",
    ". a noncommutative generalization of the flexible theory of geometry on metric spaces may indeed be well - suited to the pathologies of quantum spaces .",
    "we introduce in this paper the quantum gromov - hausdorff propinquity , a new distance between quantum compact metric spaces , which extends the gromov - hausdorff distance to noncommutative geometry and strengthens rieffel s quantum gromov - hausdorff distance and rieffel s proximity by making * -isomorphism a necessary condition for distance zero , while being well adapted to leibniz seminorms .",
    "our new metric thus meets several challenges raised by the current research in noncommutative metric geometry @xcite .",
    "indeed , the original notion of convergence for quantum compact metric spaces was introduced in @xcite by rieffel , who constructed the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance on the class of all compact quantum metric spaces .",
    "this distance , informally , did not see the multiplicative structure of the underlying c*-algebras .",
    "now , once convergence of some sequence of quantum compact metric spaces has been established for the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , it then becomes natural to investigate the behavior of sequences of associated structures , such as noncommutative vector bundles ( i.e. finitely generated projective modules ) .",
    "however , recent research on this topic @xcite reveals that both the c*-algebraic structure of the underlying space defining a quantum compact metric spaces , as well as the leibniz property for the lip - norm , play an important role . we shall call a quantum compact metric space defined as pairs of a c*-algebra and a leibniz lip - norm a _ leibniz quantum compact metric space _ in this paper , and we note that the class @xmath0 of leibniz quantum compact metric spaces includes , for instance , the class of compact c*-metric spaces introduced by rieffel .    by construction , the computation of the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , even between two leibniz quantum compact metric spaces , involve quantum compact metric spaces which are not leibniz",
    "this observation raises the challenge of defining a metric on @xmath0 whose computation only involves spaces in @xmath0 , and which extend , in some sense , the gromov - hausdorff distance , while dominating rieffel s quantum gromov - hausdorff distance  as the latter has a clear interpretation in terms of states of the quantum system described by the quantum compact metric spaces .",
    "moreover , we consider that such a distance should remember the c*-algebraic distance , which should mean at least that distance zero only occurs between * -isomorphic c*-algebras . as mentioned in @xcite , for instance , the construction of such a metric proved elusive for some time . in @xcite , rieffel introduced a pseudo - semi metric , called the quantum proximity , as a step toward answering this challenge . yet",
    "the quantum proximity is unlikely to satisfy the triangle inequality .",
    "we demonstrate that the quantum gromov - hausdorff propinquity which we introduce in this paper indeed dominates rieffel s quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , is dominated by the gromov - hausdorff distance when restricted to the class of classical metric spaces , and can be seen as a well - behaved form of rieffel s proximity , from which it takes its name .",
    "moreover , the quantum propinquity possesses the desired coincidence property .",
    "thus , we propose our new metric as a potential answer to the challenge of extending the gromov - hausdorff distance to the class @xmath0 of leibniz quantum compact metric spaces .",
    "we then note that , for our quantum propinquity , the quantum tori form a continuous family , and can be approximated by finite dimensional c*-algebras , following our work in @xcite and a remark in @xcite .",
    "a _ compact quantum metric space _ @xmath1 , as defined by rieffel @xcite is a pair of an order unit - space @xmath2 and a densely defined seminorm on @xmath2 , called a lip - norm , whose dual seminorm induces a metric on the state space @xmath3 of @xmath2 whose topology is the weak * topology .",
    "the classical picture is given by a pair @xmath4 of the algebra of @xmath5-valued continuous functions on a compact metric space @xmath6 equipped with the lipschitz seminorm @xmath7 associated with the metric @xmath8 .",
    "noncommutative examples include the ( self - adjoint part of ) quantum tori and other quantum homogeneous spaces @xcite , hyperbolic group c*-algebras @xcite , connes - landi - dubois - violette quantum spheres @xcite , among others .",
    "we generalized this structure to quantum locally compact metric spaces in @xcite .",
    "rieffel introduces his _ quantum gromov - hausdorff distance _ in @xcite , as a generalization of the gromov - hausdorff distance @xcite to compact quantum metric spaces .",
    "he showed , as a first example , that quantum tori formed a continuous family for this metric .",
    "the construction of the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance proceeds as follows : given two compact quantum metric spaces @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 , we consider the set @xmath11 of all lip - norms on @xmath12 whose quotients to @xmath2 and @xmath13 are , respectively , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "for any such admissible lip - norm @xmath16 , one may consider the hausdorff distance between @xmath3 and @xmath17 identified with their isometric copies in @xmath18 , where the state spaces @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are equipped with the metrics dual to , respectively , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the infimum of these hausdorff distances over all possible choices of @xmath19 is the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "as an example of an interesting application of this distance , we proved in @xcite that we can also use rieffel s metric to approximate quantum tori by finite dimensional c*-algebras .",
    "our work was motivated by such papers in mathematical physics as @xcite , where such finite approximations of quantum tori surfaced without any formal framework .",
    "of course , quantum tori are not af algebras  rather , the closest form of approximation of this nature , due to elliott and evans , is that irrational rotation algebras , i.e. two dimensional simple quantum tori , are at algebras , or inductive limits of circle algebras @xcite .",
    "thus our work was one of the first construction to provide some evidence that the intuition often encountered in mathematical physics could be formalized .",
    "other examples of convergence results for rieffel s metric were established regarding dubois - violette quantum spheres @xcite and finite dimensional approximations of coadjoint orbits of compact lie groups @xcite .    more generally , the study of noncommutative space - times finds its roots in a paradox which emerges from attempting to bring quantum physics and general relativity together : informally , the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics suggests that measurements at very small scale require very large momenta , and in turn , einstein s field equation implies that large localized momenta would curve space - time , so that measurement of an arbitrary small volume would actually create a small black hole whose event horizon would hide the volume one attempts to measure .",
    "a discussion of this paradox and a first , simple noncommutative space - time model to address it , was devised in @xcite .",
    "in essence , a noncommutative space - time is a structure where space - time measurements are themselves subject to uncertainty , thus preventing arbitrary precision and offering a way out of the stated paradox  while reflecting the fact that the quantum uncertainty between momentum and position paired with the relativistic connection between momentum and geometry would naturally lead one to postulate an uncertainty principle at the level of geometry . in a different direction",
    ", connes introduced a noncommutative standard model , which involves metric considerations as well @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , edwards @xcite introduced what is now known as the gromov - hausdorff distance for compact metric spaces , based upon consideration about quantum gravity , suggesting that one would have to work , not on one space - time , but rather on a `` super - space '' of possible space - times , metrized by a generalized hausdorff distance , thus allowing fluctuations in the gravitational field .",
    "edwards was following upon the suggestion to study quantum gravity by means of a superspace by wheeler @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that gromov introduces his metric @xcite for more general locally compact metric spaces , and used his metric toward major advances in group theory .",
    "thus , noncommutative metric geometry finds some of its roots in mathematical physics , and may well play a role in noncommutative theories of space - time . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance opens a new realm of mathematical possibilities : in general , the drought of sub - objects in the category of quantum spaces ( i.e. of quotients in the category of c*-algebras , where some of the most studied examples are simple c*-algebras , such as the irrational rotation algebras ) makes the study of quantum spaces difficult ; yet the quantum gromov - hausdorff topology allows for approximations of quantum spaces `` from the outside '' by other spaces , and opens new avenues for the study of c*-algebras . in the spirit of noncommutative geometry , this distance also opens the possibility to bring into the noncommutative realm the techniques of metric geometry @xcite .    when introducing the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , the choice to forget the multiplicative structure ( or at least , some of it , as the jordan products can still be recovered @xcite ) by working with order - unit spaces rather than c*-algebras , allowed for very useful constructions on which a lot of convergence results mentioned above relied , including our own @xcite .",
    "yet , the price for this choice is that rieffel s distance may be null between two non - isomorphic c*-algebras , as long as they are both isomorphic as order - unit spaces and their quantum metric space structures are isometric in a well - defined sense @xcite .",
    "this weakened form of the desirable coincidence property has sparked quite some efforts geared toward strengthening rieffel s metric @xcite . in all of these approaches ,",
    "the principle is to replace the state space with an object more connected to the c*-algebraic structure , such as unital matrix - valued completely positive maps @xcite , or the restriction of the multiplication graph to the lipschitz ball @xcite . in general , new techniques",
    "need to be devised to show that sequences which converge in the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance converge in these metrics , as they are stronger .",
    "however , it is not always clear what these techniques may be , as discussed for instance at the end of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) .",
    "it was also not immediately apparent which construction may fit the future development of the theory best .",
    "as a parallel development within the field , the importance of the c*-algebraic structure became evident as the field of noncommutative metric geometry grew .",
    "rieffel s work on convergence for vector bundles @xcite , and our own generalization of the notion of quantum metric spaces to the quantum locally compact metric spaces setup @xcite , are two such pieces of evidence .",
    "concretely , the requirement that lip - norms satisfy a strong form of the leibniz identity has emerged and generated a large effort to recast previous convergence results for the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance within this more stringent framework .",
    "rieffel introduced the class of _ compact c*-metric spaces _",
    "@xmath1 , as pairs of a unital c*-algebra @xmath2 and a densely defined seminorm on @xmath2 whose restriction to the self - adjoint part @xmath20 of @xmath2 is a lip - norm , and which satisfies , among various technical requirements , that for all @xmath21 : @xmath22 while , if @xmath23 is invertible : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the norm of @xmath2 .",
    "the property described by equation ( [ intro - leibniz - eq ] ) is the _ leibniz condition _ , whereas together , equations ( [ intro - leibniz - eq ] ) and ( [ intro - strong - leibniz - eq ] ) define what rieffel calls the _ strong leibniz condition _",
    "these additional requirements define a natural class of c*-metric spaces , and by keeping the multiplicative structure encoded , they provide a natural framework for noncommutative metric geometry . much effort has since been devoted to understanding leibniz seminorms and their metric implications ( for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that some form of the leibniz property will play a role in the theory of quantum locally compact metric spaces , which started our own investigations in these matters , resulting in this paper .",
    "there are two fascinating difficulties with this new approach .",
    "first , most original proofs of convergence for the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance involved , at some point , the use of a lip - norm which failed to be a strong leibniz seminorm , or even a leibniz seminorm  in fact , in the case of quantum tori , much work is done on order - unit spaces which are not the full self - adjoint part of a c*-algebra . indeed , to establish the continuity of the family of quantum tori for the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , a particular construction , involving continuous fields of states , leads to a lip - norm which fails to be leibniz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 11.1 ) .",
    "these fields are constructed to deal with the varying norms between different quantum tori .",
    "the same construction played a similar role in our own work on finite dimensional approximations of quantum tori @xcite .",
    "thus , if one wishes to work within the context of c*-algebras and ( strong ) leibniz seminorms , then some very non - trivial changes must be made .",
    "an example of the difficulties involved can be found in @xcite , which replaces all non - leibniz lip - norms in @xcite involved in the proof of convergence of matrix algebras to co - adjoint orbits of lie groups for the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , with strong leibniz lip - norms built using bimodules .",
    "a second , deeper difficulty , regards the proper theoretical framework to work with c*-metric spaces , or more generally , with quantum compact metric spaces whose lip - norm possess a form of the leibniz property .",
    "a natural idea could be to require , in the definition of the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance which we discussed above , that all admissible lip - norms should be strong leibniz themselves , and proceed with the construction without changes .",
    "such an approach led rieffel to define the _ proximity _ between compact c*-metric spaces in @xcite .",
    "however , this quantity is not proven to be metric , and in fact , is unlikely to be so .",
    "the main difficulty is to prove the triangle inequality .",
    "consequently , even if one proves convergence of a sequence of compact c*-metric spaces to some limit for rieffel s proximity , it is unclear whether the sequence is cauchy , and this leads to intriguing questions @xcite .",
    "this is not the first time such problems occur : kerr already faced this problem in @xcite .",
    "the main problem can be summarized in the fact that the quotient of a leibniz seminorm is not always a leibniz seminorm , as was already known in @xcite .",
    "this pathology in the behavior of leibniz seminorms makes it extremely difficult to find out a proper metric between compact c*-metric spaces .",
    "some past suggestions @xcite could prove useful , but working with them has proven quite difficult as well ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) ) .",
    "the problem , it would seem , is that there is a gap between the sort of leibniz lip - norms one constructs in practice , and any available metric on quantum compact metric spaces .",
    "we offer a solution to this second problem in the present paper .",
    "we propose a new distance , the quantum gromov - hausdorff propinquity , which we intend to play the role for which rieffel s proximity was introduced , with three very remarkable benefits .",
    "first , our quantum propinquity satisfies the triangle inequality by construction .",
    "second , it is an actual distance on compact c*-metric spaces : distance zero implies * -isomorphism and , of course , isometry of the quantum metric space structures .",
    "third , our quantum propinquity is constructed to take full advantage of the methods developed to work with strong leibniz lip - norms . to be a little more specific , given two compact quantum metric spaces @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the construction of an admissible lip - norm @xmath16 for @xmath26 , since the beginning of the research in this field @xcite , typically involves finding a seminorm @xmath27 on @xmath12 , called a bridge ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) , with sufficient properties so that : @xmath28 is an admissible lip - norm .",
    "when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are compact c*-metric spaces , it is natural to make the same sort of construction , looking for bridges which satisfy the proper version of the strong leibniz property .",
    "rieffel s original proposition @xcite is to choose an @xmath2-@xmath13-bimodule @xmath29 , with the actions of @xmath2 and @xmath13 non - degenerate , an element @xmath30 , and a bimodule norm @xmath31 on @xmath29 ( i.e. for all @xmath23,@xmath32 and @xmath33 we have @xmath34 )",
    ". then one could try to build a bridge of the form : @xmath35 for some strictly positive scalar @xmath36 .",
    "while very natural , this idea requires , in order to work , a non - trivial choice of bimodule , and to relate what being small in the sense of the seminorm @xmath37 implies on the distance between state spaces . both of these issues can present major challenges .",
    "one may prefer to replace general bimodules in the above construction with c*-algebras , both for technical practicality and for the elegance of working only within the category of c*-algebras .",
    "this is particularly sensible if one would wish to preserve the multiplicative structure of compact c*-metric spaces through convergence , in some sense .",
    "it is possible to do so in some known examples @xcite , and again , this presents interesting problems .    in our present paper ,",
    "we use the idea of the construction of bridges based on bimodules which are themselves c*-algebras as our starting point .",
    "thus , our quantum propinquity is very much motivated , not only by the theoretical need to provide a consistent framework for metric noncommutative geometry of compact c*-metric spaces , but also by the practical matter of being applicable to known and future examples .",
    "the quantum propinquity shares with li s nuclear distance @xcite the idea to use the hausdorff distance between images for * -monomorphisms of the unit balls of the lip - norms of compact quantum metric spaces , which is akin to using bridges built from bimodules which are c*-algebras .",
    "however , it is unclear how our metric and li s nuclear distance compare . a natural modification of li s nuclear distance , the unital nuclear distance introduced in @xcite , does dominate the quantum propinquity ( and li s original nuclear distance ) .",
    "compared with the unital nuclear distance , we introduce a pivot element and use it to define an inner - derivation which we include in the computation of the hausdorff distance between lip - balls .",
    "this pivot element allows us to replace approximations by order - unit spaces used for the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , by approximations involving products with the pivot element .",
    "kerr and li s unital nuclear distance would consist in always taking our pivot element to be the identity .",
    "it is less clear how to compare our quantum propinquity to li s c*-algebraic distance .",
    "our quantum propinquity is designed to work well for leibniz lip - norms , which do not play any special role for the c*-algebraic distance , and our distance works entirely within the category of c*-algebras . as",
    "our goal is to study how various structures over c*-algebras behave under metric convergence , it seems important for our goal to avoid involving more general banach spaces in our theory , as was done for instance with the c*-algebraic distance .",
    "it is an interesting question to determine what relations , if any , our two metrics have .    in a different direction , kerr",
    "s matricial distance @xcite involves complete positive , matrix - valued maps instead of states .",
    "our construction in this paper could be generalized very easily to construct a matricial propinquity , by replacing the state space by completely positive matrix valued maps as well .",
    "the resulting matricial propinquity would dominate kerr s distance for the same reason as our current metric dominates the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance .",
    "thus , while we do not require complete positivity in our work , and kerr s original motivation seems to have been to address the distance zero problem with the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , which our quantum propinquity solves in its own way , it may well be that a matricial version of the quantum propinquity could find applications in later development of the field .",
    "we also point out that our approach for the distance zero property of the quantum propinquity is more in the spirit of kerr s method than rieffel s original work on the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance .",
    "another approach to a noncommutative generalization of lipschitz algebras is found in the work of wei wu @xcite , where a quantized metric space is a matricial order unit space @xmath38 endowed with a family @xmath39 of lip - norms , each defined on @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the algebra of @xmath42 matrices , and satisfying natural compatibility conditions with the underlying operator space structure .",
    "wu showed in @xcite how to construct a quantized gromov - hausdorff distance on the class of quantized metric spaces , and how , for instance , convergence of matrix algebras to the sphere @xcite can be recast in this framework .",
    "two quantized metric spaces are at distance zero from each other for the quantized gromov - hausdorff distance if and only if there exists a complete isometry between them .",
    "once again , this suggests an interesting generalization of the quantum propinquity to a matricial , or quantized version , where one works with a sequence of lip - norms on matricial algebras associated with leibniz quantum compact metric spaces .",
    "the quantized gromov - hausdorff distance dominates the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.9 ) , but a direct comparison between our metric and the quantized gromov - hausdorff metric may prove challenging  though a quantized version of our quantum propinquity would be expected to dominate wu s distance for a similar reason as the quantum propinquity dominates rieffel s distance .",
    "thus , in summary , this paper proposes a new distance , called the quantum gromov - hausdorff propinquity , which is designed as a natural distance to work with compact c*-metric spaces , and dominates rieffel s quantum gromov - hausdorff distance .",
    "we hope that our work presents a solution to the long standing problem of working with leibniz seminorms in the context of noncommutative metric geometry , while remaining practical .",
    "our paper is organized in five sections in addition to this introduction . in a first section",
    ", we introduce the category of leibniz quantum compact metric spaces , in which we shall work , and which is a subcategory of rieffel s compact quantum metric spaces where all the underlying order - unit spaces are in fact the self - adjoint part of unital c*-algebras ( rather than some subspace of it ) and all the lip - norms satisfy a leibniz inequality and are lower semi - continuous .",
    "we then introduce the notions of bridges and treks upon which our distance is constructed .",
    "we define afterward our new distance .",
    "the proof of the coincidence property is the central piece of the next section .",
    "we conclude by showing that the quantum propinquity dominates the quantum gromov - hausdorff distance , thus providing a natural interpretation to our distance , and by showing that the gromov - hausdorff distance dominates our quantum propinquity restricted to classical compact metric spaces .",
    "the example of convergences of fuzzy and quantum tori is presented in this last section .",
    "we wish to thank m. rieffel for his comments on an earlier version of this paper .",
    "at the root of our work is a pair consisting of a c*-algebra and a seminorm enjoying various properties .",
    "we start with the most minimal assumptions on such pairs and introduce the context of our paper .",
    "we denote the self - adjoint part of any c*-algebra @xmath2 by @xmath20 , and the unit of a unital c*-algebra @xmath2 by @xmath43 .",
    "the norm of any space @xmath44 is denoted by @xmath45 unless otherwise specified .",
    "[ lipschitz - pair - def ] a _ unital lipschitz pair _ @xmath1 is a unital c*-algebra @xmath2 and a seminorm @xmath16 defined on a dense subspace @xmath46 of @xmath20 such that : @xmath47    it will often be convenient to adopt the following convention regarding lipschitz pairs :    [ dom - convention ] we denote the domain of a densely defined seminorm @xmath16 on @xmath20 by @xmath46",
    ". we will usually regard @xmath16 as a _",
    "generalized _ seminorm on the whole of @xmath20 by setting @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "we shall adopt this convention whenever convenient without further mention .",
    "moreover , we adopt the measure - theoretic convention regarding computations with @xmath50 , namely : @xmath51 for all @xmath52 $ ] while @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for all @xmath55 . with this convention , we have : @xmath56    at the core of noncommutative metric geometry are the quantum metric spaces , defined in @xcite by rieffel in the compact case , and generalized by the present author to the locally compact setup in @xcite .",
    "in either situation , the metric data encoded by a lipschitz pair is reflected by the following distance on the state space of the underlying c*-algebra :    the _ state space _ of a c*-algebra @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "[ mongekant - def ] the _ monge - kantorovich metric _ associated with a unital lipschitz pair @xmath1 is the distance @xmath57 defined on the state space @xmath3 of @xmath2 as : @xmath58    definition ( [ lipschitz - pair - def ] ) of a unital lipschitz pair is designed precisely so that the associated monge - kantorovich metric is indeed an extended metric , as one can easily check : it satisfies all axioms of a metric , except that it may take the value @xmath50 .",
    "this extended metric has a long history and many names , and could fairly be called the monge - kantorovich - rubinstein - wasserstein - dobrushin - connes- rieffel metric .",
    "it finds its roots in the transportation problem introduced in 1781 by monge , which was later studied by kantorovich , who introduced this metric @xcite in 1940 .",
    "the form we use was first given for classical metric spaces in 1958 by kantorovich and rubinstein @xcite .",
    "in the context of probability theory , wasserstein later re - introduced this same metric in 1969 @xcite .",
    "dobrushin @xcite named this metric after wasserstein , and also studied the properties of this metric in the noncompact setting , which was fundamental to our work in @xcite on quantum locally compact metric spaces .",
    "connes suggested in @xcite to use definition ( [ mongekant - def ] ) to study metric properties in noncommutative geometry , when @xmath16 is the seminorm associated with a spectral triple . in @xcite , rieffel expanded on connes idea by introducing the more general framework within which this paper is written .",
    "our choice of terminology is somewhat arbitrary , based loosely on the order of appearance of this metric , and in line with rieffel s terminology .",
    "the fundamental idea of rieffel @xcite is to match the topology induced by the monge - kantorovich metric to the natural topology on the state space :    a _ quantum compact metric space@xmath1 _ is a unital lipschitz pair such that the associated monge - kantorovich metric @xmath57 induces the weak * topology on the state space @xmath3 of @xmath2 . if @xmath1 is a quantum compact metric space , then @xmath16 is called a _ lip - norm _ on @xmath20 .",
    "[ a - remark ] rieffel s _ compact quantum metric spaces _ are pairs @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an order unit space , and @xmath16 is a densely defined seminorm on @xmath2 which vanishes exactly on the scalar multiple of the order unit of @xmath2 , such that the monge - kantorovich metric defined by definition ( [ mongekant - def ] ) metrizes the weak * topology of @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath3 is meant for the state space of @xmath2 as an order unit space @xcite .",
    "we shall only work in this paper in the context where the order - unit spaces are , in fact , the set of all self - adjoints elements of a unital c*-algebra  in fact we are particularly interested in the multiplicative structure and its relation to noncommutative metric geometry .",
    "as our definition is a special case of rieffel s , we employ a slightly different terminology , where we inverse the order of the words _ quantum _ and _ compact _ , in line with our own terminology in @xcite . *",
    "thus we emphasize that in this paper , quantum compact metric spaces are always a pair of a @xmath59-algebra and a lip - norm on it * , not more general c*-normed algebras or order unit spaces .",
    "if @xmath1 is a quantum compact metric space , then the weak * topology of @xmath3 is metrizable , and since @xmath3 is weak * compact , @xmath3 is separable in the weak * topology , which in turn implies that the topological dual of @xmath2 is separable by the hahn - jordan decomposition .",
    "thus , one easily checks that @xmath2 is separable in norm .",
    "the inspiration for rieffel s definition is found within the classical picture given by classical compact metric spaces :    [ classical - ex ] let @xmath6 be a compact metric space . for any function @xmath60 , we define the _ lipschitz constant of @xmath61 _ as : @xmath62 which in general may be infinite . of course , if @xmath63 is a lipschitz function , i.e. if @xmath61 has finite lipschitz constant , then @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the c*-algebra of continuous functions from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "it is immediate that a function has zero lipschitz constant if and only if it is constant on @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , the set of lipschitz functions is norm - dense in @xmath68 by the stone - weierstra theorem , and thus @xmath69 is a unital lipschitz pair .    as a prelude of the rest of this section",
    ", we also note that arzla - ascoli s theorem shows that the set : @xmath70 is norm compact , for any @xmath71 . in turn",
    "this property implies that @xmath57 metrizes the weak * topology on the space @xmath72 of radon probability measures on @xmath66 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath69 is a quantum compact metric space .",
    "a form of arzla - ascoli theorem serves as the main characterization of quantum compact metric spaces .",
    "it first appeared in @xcite , at the very root of this theory of quantum metric spaces . an equivalent formulation of this result appeared in @xcite , which we then generalized to the locally compact setting in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.10 ) .",
    "we summarize these characterizations of quantum compact metric spaces as follows :    @xcite[az - thm ] let @xmath1 be a unital lipschitz pair .",

    "we believe that it is likely that future applications of the quantum propinquity will benefit from either or both assumptions , though at the moment we find no reason to restrict the level of generality of our construction .",
    "thus , we put the minimal assumption on our pivot elements , and we simply remark that the proofs of this section would carry identically if we added the restriction of self - adjointness of the pivot , or imposed some bound on the norm of the pivot .    a priori , the @xmath167-level of an element may be empty , but we shall only be interested in elements with non - empty @xmath167-level in our work .",
    "the key purpose of this set for us is the following lemma :    let @xmath169 be a unital c*-algebra .",
