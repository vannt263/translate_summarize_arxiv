    "it is now a well - known issue that gravity induces uncertainty .",
    "incorporation of gravity in quantum field theory leads naturally to an effective cutoff ( a minimal measurable length ) in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "in fact , the high energies used to probe small distances significantly disturb the spacetime structure by their powerful gravitational effects . some approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "loop quantum gravity @xcite and quantum geometry @xcite all indicate the existence of a minimal measurable length of the order of the planck length , @xmath0 ( see also @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , some gedanken experiments in the spirit of black hole physics have also supported the idea of existence of a minimal measurable length @xcite .",
    "so , existence of a minimal observable length is a common feature of all promising quantum gravity candidates .",
    "the existence of a minimal measurable length modifies the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) to the so called generalized ( gravitational ) uncertainty principle ( gup ) . in hup framework",
    "there is essentially no restriction on the measurement precision of the particles position so that @xmath1 as the minimal position uncertainty could be made arbitrarily small toward zero .",
    "but this is not essentially the case in the gup framework due to existence of a minimal uncertainty in position measurement .",
    "the presence of the minimal observable length also modifies the hamiltonian of physical systems leading to planck scale modification of the energy spectrum of quantum systems .",
    "this issue stimulated a lot of research programs in recent years , some of which are addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . one can adopt the concept of the existence of a minimal observable length as a nonzero minimal uncertainty @xmath1 in position measurements .",
    "this feature would be a route to the noncommutative structure of spacetime at the planck scale and makes spacetime manifold to have a foam - like structure at this scale .",
    "based on these arguments , one can not probe distances smaller than the planck length in a finite time . in an elegant paper , kempf _",
    "et al . _ have formulated the hilbert space representation of quantum mechanics in the presence of a minimal measurable length @xcite .",
    "this work has been the basis of a large number of research programs in recent years .",
    "on the other hand , doubly special relativity theories ( for review see for instance @xcite ) suggest that existence of a minimal measurable length would restrict a test particles momentum to take any arbitrary values leading to an upper bound , @xmath2 , on this momentum .",
    "this means that there is a maximal particles momentum due to fundamental structure of spacetime at the planck scale @xcite-@xcite .",
    "here we are going to generalize the seminal work of kempf _ et al .",
    "_ to the case that the existence of a maximal particles momentum is considered too .",
    "this extra ingredient brings a lot of new features to the hilbert space representation of quantum mechanics at the planck scale .",
    "we note that a more general case includes also a nonzero , _ minimal _ uncertainty in momentum measurement as well as position . however , this general case is far more difficult to handle since neither a position nor a momentum space representation is available ( see ref.@xcite for more details ) .",
    "here we consider the case that there is just a minimal uncertainty in position and particles momentum is restricted also to the upper bound @xmath3 . by allowing the minimal uncertainty in momentum to vanish , the heisenberg algebra can be studied in momentum space easily . in this manner",
    ", we can explore the quantum physical implications and hilbert space representation in the presence of a minimal measurable length and a maximal particles momentum .",
    "we compare our results with kempf _",
    "work @xcite in each step .",
    "in ordinary quantum mechanics , the standard heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) is given by @xmath4 there is no trace of gravity in this relation . today we know that hup breaks down for energies close to the planck scale where the corresponding schwarzschild radius becomes comparable with the compton wavelength and both becoming approximately equal to the planck length .",
    "by taking into account the gravitational effect , emergence of a minimal measurable distance is inevitable .",
    "this is encoded in the following generalized(gravitational ) uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite @xmath5 the additional term ,  @xmath6 has its origin on the very nature of spacetime at the planck energy scale .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the simplest gup relation which implies the appearance of a nonzero minimal uncertainty @xmath1 in position has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gup parameter defined as @xmath9 ,  and @xmath10 gev is the 4-dimensional fundamental scale .",
    "it is normally assumed that @xmath11 , which is a dimensionless number , is not far from unity , that is , @xmath12 ( see for instance @xcite-@xcite ) . at energies much below the planck energy ,",
    "the extra term in right hand side of ( 2 ) would be irrelevant , which means @xmath13  and the standard hup relation is recovered . instead",
    ", approaching the planck energy scale , this term becomes relevant and , as has been said , it is related to the minimal measurable length . from an string theory viewpoint ,",
    "since a string can not probe distances smaller than its length , existence of a minimal observable length is natural .    since for any pair of observables",

    "then it has been shown that this may lead to a maximal measurable momentum for a test particle @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the gup that predicts both a minimal observable length and a maximal momentum can be written as follows @xcite-@xcite @xmath27 in this framework the following algebraic structure can be deduced ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath17 = i\\hbar\\big(1 - \\alpha p + 2\\alpha^2 p^2\\big)\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the gup parameter in the presence of both minimal length and maximal momentum and @xmath29 .",

    "this term is the source of differences between our analysis of the hilbert space representation and the seminal work presented in ref.@xcite . before treating our main problem , here",
    "we digress for a moment to show how maximal momentum arises in this setup .",

    "due to duality of position and momentum operators , it is reasonable to assume @xmath40 . now with @xmath41 in the boundary of the allowed region and setting @xmath42 to obtain absolute maximal momentum , we arrive at @xmath43 since @xmath44 , we find @xmath45 this results in @xmath46 so we find @xmath47 now using the value of @xmath48 , we find @xmath49 the solution of this equation is @xmath50 as a nontrivial assumption we assume this is the maximal momentum in our setup .",
    "we use this value in our forthcoming arguments .",
    "in which follows , we reconsider the issue of hilbert space representation of quantum mechanics in the line of ref.@xcite but with new ingredient coming from existence of a maximal momentum .",
    "we show that there are a lots of new implications in this framework .",
    "as a nontrivial assumption , we assume the minimal observable length to be also minimal , nonzero uncertainty in position . therefore , we have no longer a hilbert space representation on position space wave functions of the ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "this is because there is no more physical state which is a position eigenstate @xmath51 , since an eigenstate would have zero uncertainty in position .",
    "this means that we must construct a new hilbert space representation which is compatible with our commutation relation in gup ( 11 ) .",
    "fortunately , by neglecting the presence of a minimal uncertainty in momentum , there still would exist a continuous momentum space representation , which means that we can explore the physical implications of the minimal length by working with the convenient representation of the commutation relations on momentum space wave functions .      in this subsection",
    "we consider the momentum space representation . to obtain a minimum measurable uncertainty in position ,",
    "the inequality ( 7 ) on the boundary of the allowed region gives @xmath52 using @xmath53 , this relation can be rewritten as a second order equation for @xmath54 .",
    "the solutions for @xmath54 are as follows @xmath55 the reality of solutions gives the following minimum value for @xmath56 @xmath57 therefore the absolutely smallest uncertainty in position , where @xmath58 , would be @xmath59 now , in our momentum space , we take operators * p * and * x * in the form @xmath60 @xmath61 where _ x _ = @xmath62 .",
    "then by operating on momentum space wave function , we have @xmath63 @xmath64 the scalar product in this representation should be modified due to the presence of the additional factor @xmath65 and existence of the maximal momentum as @xmath66 we note that in kmm ( kempf _ et al . _ ) formalism , since there is no restriction on particle s momentum , the integrals are calculated from @xmath67 to @xmath68 . here , the presence of the term @xmath69 in @xmath70 implies the existence of a maximal particle s momentum ( the planck momentum , @xmath71 ) which affects the scalar product as we see in eq.(27 ) .",
    "this fact requires a reconsideration of the kmm formulation of the hilbert space representation . in this framework",
    ", the identity operator would be represented as @xmath72 and the scalar product of the momentum eigenstates changes to @xmath73 the existence of maximal particle s momentum in addition to minimal observable length , has several new implications on the hilbert space representation that we are going to study some of them in forthcoming sections .",
    "the position operator acting on momentum space eigenstates gives @xmath74 where by definition @xmath75 is a formal position eigenstate and @xmath76 is an arbitrary state .",

    "as kmm have shown , due to existence of a minimal measurable length , * x * is a symmetric operator , but not self - adjoint @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in our case ,",
    "due to existence of a maximal momentum , the momentum space wave function @xmath193 vanishes at @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the maximal momentum .",
    "in this situation , @xmath36 is a derivative operator on an interval with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath36 can not be self - adjoint since all candidates for the eigenfunctions of @xmath36 are not in the domain of @xmath36 because they obey no longer the dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the domain of @xmath234 is much larger than that of @xmath36 , so @xmath36 is indeed not self - adjoint . to be more precise ,",
    "note that in our case @xmath235 @xmath236    since @xmath193 vanishes at @xmath237 , then @xmath238 can attain any arbitrary value at the boundaries .",
    "the above equation implies that @xmath36 is symmetric , but it is not a self - adjoint operator . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath36 acts on @xmath239 while @xmath234 that has the same formal expression , acts on a different space of functions , namely @xmath240 with no further restriction on @xmath241 .",
    "nevertheless , as kempf has shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , there are self - adjoint extensions of position operator . since we have worked in the basis that there is no minimal uncertainty of momentum operator , the analysis presented in ref.@xcite is essentially applicable to our case too .",
    "in fact , bi - adjoint operator of the densely defined symmetric position operator is symmetric and closed and has non - empty deficiency subspaces . from the dimensionalities of these subspaces",
    "one concludes that the position operator is no longer essentially self - adjoint but has a continuous , one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions instead @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the self - adjointness property of @xmath37 can be proven by using the von neumann s theorem ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) in the same way as has been shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to refs.@xcite-@xcite for further developments of these issues .",
    "all approaches to quantum gravity proposal support , at least phenomenologically , the existence of a minimal measurable length of the order of planck length . also , based on doubly special relativity theories , a test particle s momentum can not attain any arbitrary values and is restricted to a maximal value of the order of planck momentum .",
    "hilbert space representation of quantum mechanics with a minimal measurable length has been studied by kempf _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "here we have generalized the kmm seminal work to the case that there is also a maximal test particle s momentum .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of both minimal length and maximal momentum there is no divergency in energy spectrum of a test particle .",
    "unlike the kmm case that energies of the short wavelength modes were divergent , in our case there is no divergency in energy at short wavelengths . as a result , while in the kmm case , where the quasiposition wavefunctions had no longer arbitrarily fine ripples , in the presence of maximal momentum those wavefunctions can have arbitrarily fine ripples . in this respect unlike the kmm scenario , we obtained correct limiting equations in the language of the correspondence principle .",
    "as we have shown , position operator @xmath36 is symmetric but not self - adjoint in our case .",
    "nevertheless , since there is no minimal uncertainty in momentum , the self - adjointness of @xmath37 is guarantied by the von neumann s theorem .",
    "we note however that even for the self - adjoint position and momentum operators , it is by no means obvious that the resulting hamiltonian for physical systems will be self - adjoint unless the potential term is specified and the appropriate domain is chosen .",
    "finally , we note that a more general treatment of the hilbert space representation includes also a nonzero , minimal uncertainty in momentum measurement as well as position .",
    "this general case is far more difficult to handle since neither a position nor a momentum space representation is available .",
    "this feature can be considered as a new research program . + * acknowledgement *    we are very grateful to achim kempf , saurya das , giovanni amelino - camelia and pouria pedram for very fruitful discussions and suggestions .",
