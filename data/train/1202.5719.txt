    "<S> this is understandable because what we demonstrate is the scaling behavior around the critical points for the parity breaking , instead of the qpt for localization . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , similar to the results in @xcite , we also find that the maximal entanglement appears when approaching the point @xmath126 from the delocalization side and then a rapid disentanglement at the localization side .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have indicated the parity breaking in the sbm and investigated analytically the scaling behavior of the magnetization and the entanglement as well as their relationship in the neighborhood of the critical points for the parity breaking after suppressing the intrinsic infrared divergence in the spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the conventionally employed spectral function is not fully reasonable and the previous conclusions drawn for the qpt happening in the ohmic and sub - ohmic sbm need more serious reexamination . our analytical treatment for the scaling behavior is suitable for all types of the bath and should be of general interest , which is helpful for clarifying different numerical results in previous publications and for understanding the phenomena due to parity breaking and the physics hidden by the infrared divergence .    </S>",
