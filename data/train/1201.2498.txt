    "observation of microwave - resonance - induced magnetoconductivity oscillations in the multisubband two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system formed on the free surface of liquid helium  @xcite have attracted much interest .",
    "these oscillations appear to be very similar to @xmath0-periodic resistivity ( @xmath1 ) oscillations observed in ultrahigh - mobility gaas / algaas heterostructures subjected to a dc magnetic field and to strong microwave ( mw ) radiation of a quite arbitrary frequency @xmath2  @xcite ( here @xmath3 is the cyclotron frequency ) . at low temperatures @xmath4 , oscillations reported for surface electrons ( ses ) on liquid helium have a peculiar shape which is reminiscent of a derivative of a peaky function rather than a sum of simple maxima expected for usual scattering . with an increase in radiation power ,",
    "the minima of the magnetooscillations evolve in zero - magnetoconductivity @xmath5 states  @xcite , which are very similar to zero - resistance states ( zrs ) observed in semiconductor 2d electron systems  @xcite , because , under a strong magnetic field , both @xmath6 and @xmath1 are proportional to the effective collision frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the only important difference of these two similar phenomena is that for ses on liquid helium magneto - oscillations are observed only in the vicinity of a specific mw frequency @xmath8 , representing the resonance frequency for excitation of the second surface subband .    in semiconductor systems ,",
    "zrs are explained  @xcite as a consequence of the negative linear conductivity condition @xmath9 which appears for high radiation power .",
    "due to instability of the system under this condition , it enters a nonlinear regime and develops a steady current state with @xmath10 . mechanisms of the negative linear response conductivity of a 2d electron gas formed in semiconductor structures are based on photon - induced impurity scattering within the ground subband  @xcite .",
    "they were quite successful in explaining magneto - oscillations and zrs induced by mw radiation in semiconductor systems .",
    "unfortunately , they can not be applied for explanation of negative conductivity effects in the 2d electron system formed on the liquid helium surface , because the mw frequency @xmath11 considered in these theories is not restricted by the condition @xmath8 .",
    "the new mechanism of the negative linear response conductivity reported recently  @xcite is based on nonequilibrium filling of the second surface subband , @xmath12induced by mw excitation ( here @xmath13 is the number of electrons at the corresponding surface subband and @xmath14 is the electron temperature ) .",
    "this condition provides a new channel for negative momentum relaxation due to usual quasi - elastic inter - subband scattering .",
    "this possibility can be seen already from the energy conservation for electron scattering from the excited subband ( @xmath15 ) to the ground subband ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "consider the electron energy spectrum in a magnetic filed applied perpendicular to the surface@xmath17(here @xmath18 is the spectrum of se states , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the center coordinate of the cyclotron motion , and @xmath21 is the dc electric field directed antiparallel to the @xmath22-axis ) . then , the energy conservation yields @xmath23 in this equation , @xmath24 is not a photon quantum .",
    "it is the energy difference for electron excitation in the @xmath25-direction ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "since @xmath27 is substantially higher than @xmath3 , and @xmath28 ( here @xmath29 ) , scattering down the surface levels means scattering up the landau levels @xmath30 and we have@xmath31thus , quasi - elastic inter - subband scattering from @xmath15 to @xmath16 will be the scattering against the driving force ( @xmath32 ) , if @xmath33 , or when @xmath34 is a bit lower than the level matching point @xmath35 .",
    "at the same conditions , electron scattering up the surface levels is obviously the scattering along the driving force ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "therefore , for the appearance of the negative conductivity correction , the additional condition of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is necessary .    in semiconductor 2d electron systems  @xcite ,",
    "resistance minima occur at @xmath37 . for surface electrons on liquid helium of the areal density @xmath38 ,",
    "magnetoconductivity minima reported in ref .",
    "are also located approximately near these `` magic '' numbers @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate if there is really such strong correlation in positions of @xmath40 and @xmath6 minima for these two different phenomena induced by mw excitation . in the single - electron theory of mw - induced magnetooscillations  @xcite ,",
    "the conductivity minima are placed substantially closer to the level matching numbers @xmath41 , because the landau level broadening is very small for ses on liquid helium .",
    "it is expected that larger distances of @xmath6 minima from the level matching points observed in the experiment will be explained by the many - electron effect .",
    "an additional interest in studying this problem is inspired by the observation of the resonant photovoltaic effect which emerges at the minima of conductivity oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the important conclusion of the single - electron treatment of mw - induced magneto - oscillations is that the negative conductivity terms are large for an electron system with extremely narrow landau levels , when the collision broadening of landau levels @xmath42 is much smaller than temperature @xmath43 .",
    "this condition is well realized for surface electrons on liquid helium .",
    "still , under usual experimental conditions , this electron system is in the strong coulomb coupling regime , which means that the average coulomb interaction energy of an electron @xmath44 is much larger than @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , a thorough investigation of coulombic effects on magnetoconductivity oscillations is required .    in this work ,",
    "we report the many - electron theory of magnetoconductivity oscillations induced by resonance mw excitation which takes into account strong coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "we use the fluctuational electric field concept  @xcite which was generalized  @xcite to incorporate the collision broadening of landau levels . in the new theory ,",
    "the coulomb interaction between electrons affects strongly the line - shape and broadening of magnetoconductivity oscillations . as a result ,",
    "positions of @xmath6 minima become dependent strongly on electron density @xmath47 and on the level matching number @xmath41 .",
    "this coulombic effect appears to be very sensitive to electron temperature , therefore , it could be used for estimation of electron heating in experiments on mw - induced magnetooscillations .",
    "at low enough temperatures , depending on electron density , the 2d electron system formed on the free surface of liquid helium undergoes the wigner solid transition .",
    "this transition occurs when @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is a broad range @xmath49 , where the electron system represents a highly correlated coulomb liquid .",
    "these conditions are quite usual for experiments on ses in liquid helium .",
    "it is well established that already at @xmath50 the electron velocity autocorrelation time @xmath51 is very high and close to the reciprocal of the harmonic oscillator frequency in a 2d triangular electron lattice  @xcite .",
    "this allows to simplify the transport theory , using the assumption that ses are at equilibrium in the moving center - of - mass reference frame . in the semiclassical transport theory ,",
    "this simplest many - electron effect increases the effective collision frequency of ses by a numerical factor of the order of 2 , which depends on the perpendicular electric field @xmath52 . in the presence of the quantizing magnetic field",
    ", another kind of many - electron effect becomes important which can substantially reduce the effective collision frequency as compared to the result of the single - electron treatment .",
    "the influence of coulomb interaction on electron scattering under magnetic field can be well understood in terms of the quasi - uniform electric field of fluctuational origin , acting on each electron of a 2d electron liquid .",
    "it is assumed that , under the condition @xmath53 , an electron is displaced from an equilibrium position due to thermal fluctuations  @xcite similar to an electron in a triangular wigner lattice .",
    "when the magnetic length @xmath54 is much smaller than the electron spacing @xmath55 , the restoring electric field of other electrons @xmath56 can be considered as a quasi - uniform field , causing a fast drift velocity of the electron orbit center @xmath57 directed perpendicular to @xmath56 .",
    "the fast motion of cyclotron obit centers affects strongly the magnetoconductivity of electrons scattered by helium vapor atoms  @xcite and capillary wave quanta ( ripplons )  @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo simulations  @xcite indicate that , in a wide range of the ratio @xmath58 , the distribution of the fluctuational electric field is close to a gaussian with the width parameter given by @xmath59 .",
    "it is remarkable that a strong quasi - uniform fluctuational field does not smear off landau levels , because any uniform field can be eliminated by a proper choice of the reference frame .",
    "it is the frame where the cyclotron orbit center is at rest , and the electron spectrum coincides with the usual landau spectrum . in the laboratory frame , the fluctuational field tilts the landau levels similar to eq .",

    "we shall generalize the many - electron theory of quantum magnetotransport in 2d coulomb liquids developed in ref .   by including in consideration inter - subband scattering .",
    "in particular , we shall consider the decay rate of the first excited subband , which determines subband occupancies under the mw resonance .",

    "( [ e20])-([e22 ] ) ] allows to describe photoconductivity of ses on liquid helium in a wide range of the parameter @xmath275 up to the wigner solid transition .",
    "the main conclusion of the many - electron theory reported in this work is that the unusual mw - induced magneto - oscillations of @xmath6 and zrs can exist in multisubband 2d electron systems even under strong coulomb coupling conditions ( @xmath276 ) relevant to experiments  @xcite .",
    "coulomb forces acting between electrons affect strongly the broadening of magneto - oscillations and positions of conductivity extremes , which become dependent on electron density , the level matching number @xmath41 and the electron temperature .",
    "therefore , for ses on liquid helium , in the many - electron theory , there are no fixed `` magic '' numbers describing positions of conductivity minima on the @xmath232-axis .",
    "the proximity of experimentally observed minima to @xmath277 , most likely , is accidental ( valid only for a specific electron density ) . a substantial dependence of the distance of @xmath6 minima from the point @xmath278 on the level matching number @xmath41 , which can be seen in experimental data of ref .",
    ", agrees qualitatively with this conclusion .",
    "numerical calculations of se magnetoconductivity shown in the previous section were performed under the assumption that electrons are not substantially heated by the mw ( @xmath279 ) .",
    "this assumption allows the many - electron theory to reproduce remarkable shapes of @xmath6 oscillations observed for ses on liquid helium .",
    "the inclusion of coulomb interaction in the theory affects crucially the dependence of the amplitude of magnetooscillations on the magnetic field strength . in the many - electron theory",
    ", the amplitude of oscillations eventually begins decreasing with lowering @xmath34 , which agrees with experimental observations . even though the coulombic effect suppresses amplitudes of magneto - oscillations , under experimental conditions of ref .  , the linear theory results in @xmath9 at certain ranges of magnetic and mw fields .",
    "the comparison of theoretical and experimental @xmath254 curves indicates that typically the real heating of ses is not strong and most likely @xmath280 . since @xmath281 , a strong increase in electron temperature ( @xmath282 )",
    "would lead to deep drops of @xmath5 at the both sides of the level matching conditions , which contradicts to observations . in the single - electron theory , with an increase in electron temperature",
    "the sign - changing correction @xmath209 becomes more efficient than @xmath204 and @xmath207 , because @xmath113 is independent of @xmath14 . in the many - electron theory ,",
    "the coulomb correction to the broadening of @xmath283 increases with electron temperature , @xmath284 , and therelative increase in efficiency of @xmath209 as compared to @xmath285 and @xmath207 approaches a saturation , when @xmath286 .",
    "the electron heating affects positions of @xmath6 extremes , which also can be used for estimation of @xmath14 .",
    "the many - electron theory of cold ses results in minima distances from the level matching points which are of the same order , as those observed experimentally .",
    "this also agrees with the estimation @xmath287 given above .",
    "regarding negative conductivity values obtained in the linear theory , regions with @xmath9 are surely unstable , because any electron density fluctuation produces an electric field which increases the fluctuation . for the coulomb liquid formed on the liquid helium surface ,",
    "even the fluctuational field @xmath56 can be a cause for instability , because excited ses will be scattered against the restoring force @xmath288 .",
    "the edge of the 2d electron system on liquid helium is usually fixed by application of a dc confining field of corbino and guard electrodes which also can be a cause for instability of the system at @xmath9 .",
    "a stable state can be achieved under the nonlinear transport regime by forming a strong steady current @xmath289 , of which @xmath10 . in the 2d coulomb liquid on the surface of liquid helium ,",
    "formation of current domains is unlikely because of strong electron correlations .",
    "the ses usually have no source and drain electrodes .",
    "therefore , a steady current can be formed only by electrons circling the center of the electron pool .",
    "since it is impossible to create a strong current density in the center , electrons will move to the edges of the electron liquid depleting the center .",
    "as a result , a nonuniform electron density distribution along the surface will be formed to provide radial electric field and a circling current , strong enough to make @xmath290 . at a fixed magnetic field",
    ", a change in electron density additionally helps the system to leave the unstable regime , due to the many - electron effect described here .",
    "thus , under the condition @xmath9 of the linear transport regime , electron moving against the confining force of corbino and guard electrodes is the most likely way to reach a stable state .",
    "this scenario agrees with recent observations of the resonant photovoltaic effect for ses on liquid helium  @xcite , where mw excitation causes a strong displacement of surface electrons towards the edges ( against the confining force ) , if the magnetic field is close to the minima of the conductivity oscillations .",
    "therefore , experimental observation of the strong density dependence of positions of conductivity minima consistent with the results of the many - electron theory would be an additional evidence for the negative conductivity as the origin of the resonant photovoltaic effect .",
