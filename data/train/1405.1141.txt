    "dynamics of an electron in periodic potential and external electric field is characterized by bloch oscillations @xcite , which is a feature of the intraband electron dynamics , and zener tunneling @xcite , which is related to interband coupling .",
    "the bloch oscillations occur due to acceleration of an electron by electric field , which is described by the  acceleration theorem \" in the reciprocal space @xcite , and subsequent bragg reflections from the periodic lattice potential at the boundaries of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the interference of the electron wave packet , following such periodic dynamics in the reciprocal space , results in wannier - stark ( ws ) localization of an electron in the coordinate space @xcite .",
    "these ws states within a given band are separated by the bloch oscillation frequency @xcite forming an equidistant ws ladder .",
    "the bloch oscillations and the corresponding ws states have been observed experimentally in semiconductor superlattices @xcite .",
    "recently the bloch oscillations were reportedto to play a major role in high harmonic generation by intense infrared @xcite and terahertz @xcite pulses in crystalline solids .",
    "the external electric field not only modifies the intraband electron dynamics , which results in the formation of the ws states , but also introduces interband coupling of the states of different bands .",
    "such coupling can be described in terms of the zener tunneling resulting in finite widths of the ws levels ( resonances ) of individual bands @xcite , or in terms of eigenstates of coupled hamiltonian , which results in mixing of the corresponding ws states of different bands .",
    "the strongest mixing occurs in the resonance , when the energies of the ws levels of different bands are equal . as a function of electric field , at these points the levels exhibit anticrossing behavior . in time - dependent electric field , e.g. , in the electric field of an optical pulse , passing of these anticrossings defines time - dependent electron dynamics .",
    "this can be described as an adiabatic formation of ws states of different bands with subsequent passage of the anticrossing points .",
    "depending on relation between the anticrossing gap and the rate of change of electric field , the dynamics of this passage can be adiabatic or diabatic @xcite .",
    "such a description of electron dynamics in time - dependent electric field was successfully used for interpretation of experimental results on interaction of ultrashort intense optical pulses with dielectrics @xcite .",
    "description of interaction of time - dependent electric field , e.g. , optical pulse , with a solid in terms of the dynamics of passage of anticrossing points requires knowledge of both the positions of the anticrossing points and the magnitudes of the corresponding anticrossing gaps .",
