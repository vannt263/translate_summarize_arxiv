    "water is a dominant coolant of outflows around cool oxygen - rich stars ( goldreich & scoville 1976 , gs hereafter ; chen & neufeld 1995 , cn hereafter ; truong - bach et al 1999 , tb hereafter ) .",
    "however , until recently observations of water cooling lines were impossible because of the atmospheric opacity at these wavelengths . the situation has changed with the successful launch of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "one of the first objects observed with iso was w hydrae , an m7.5 semi - regular red giant , and it showed the expected thermal water emission in observations with both the sws ( neufeld et al 1996 ; hereafter n96 ) and lws instruments ( barlow et al 1996 ; hereafter b96 ) .",
    "both teams also fitted their observations based on the gs approach , resulting in strikingly different estimates for the mass loss rate : 6@xmath110@xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath0 ( b96 ) and ( 0.53)@xmath110@xmath4 m@xmath3 yr@xmath0 ( n96 ) . here",
    "we aim to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "in contrast with the original studies we construct a self - consistent model of the radiation field , dust , and gas in the shell , taking account of all the infrared continuum observations as an additional constraint .",
    "the driving force of the wind is radiation pressure on the dust , the gas particles are dragged along by collisions with the dust grains .",
    "the internal properties of the gas , such as temperature , do not play any role in the dynamics , the wind structure can be obtained by solving the coupled equations for hydrodynamics and dust radiative transfer .",
    "we now describe our calculation for w hya . with the derived model",
    "we proceed to solve the h@xmath5o level population problem .",
    "a complete calculation of the wind structure requires a solution of the coupled hydrodynamics and dust radiative transfer problems .",
    "traditionally these calculations involved a large number of input parameters .",
    "however , @xcite noted that the dusty wind problem possesses general scaling properties such that , for a given type of grains , both the dynamics and radiative transfer depend primarily on a single parameter ",
    "the overall optical depth .",
    "subsequent analysis by @xcite established rigorously that the dust radiative transfer problem possesses scaling properties under the most general circumstances .",
    "scaling was incorporated in the code dusty @xcite , which solves fully the dusty wind problem .",
    "the solution provides the radial variation of the velocity and radiation fields in terms of the scaled distance @xmath6 , where  is the shell inner boundary . that boundary is defined by the condition @xmath7 , where  is the dust condensation temperature .",
    "the actual value of  never enters .",
    "we use for modeling `` astronomical silicate '' dust grains with optical constants from @xcite and the power law size distribution of @xcite .",
    "we assume prompt dust formation at @xmath8 = 1 and no further grain growth or destruction .",
    "the only input parameter in addition to the dust properties is the stellar temperature @xmath9 = 2500  k @xcite . from a series of dusty models in which we varied the visual optical depth , the temperature  and the shell outer radius @xmath10 = /  we chose the one that best fits all the observations all the way from 1  to 1.2 mm ;",
    "because of its irregular variability , optical data is not included .",
    "we find that models with  = 0.71.0 ,  = 9001100  k and @xmath11 1000 are almost equally successful in reproducing the observational spectrum .",
    "the most significant parameter by far is ;  has only a small effect on the fitting and the role of @xmath10 is marginal .",
    "the model with  = 0.83 , = 1000  k and @xmath10 = 12,000 minimizes the fitting errors and is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . matching the model flux to observations in scale as well as spectral",
    "shape determines the shell angular dimensions @xcite .",
    "the shell inner diameter is 0182 , consistent with the measured stellar diameter 0046 @xcite , and its outer diameter 36 , in agreement with the iras observations of @xcite .",
    "the statistical rate equations for the water level populations require the following input : the radiation field , to determine radiative excitations ; the gas density and temperature , for the collision rates ; and the water column density , required for the line radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "dusty s output provides the radiation field as well as the dimensionless velocity and density profiles in the shell .",
    "fixing the scale of densities requires two additional input properties .",
    "we take the distance @xmath12 = 115 pc from the hipparcos catalog .",
    "this sets  = 1.6 cm and  @xmath13 1 pc , and the luminosity is 11,050  in agreement with @xcite .",
    "next , the wind terminal velocity  = 8  @xcite fixes the velocity scale and determines the gas - to - dust mass ratio  = 850 and the mass - loss rate = 2.3  yr@xmath0 .",
    "the complete velocity profile is shown in figure 2 together with the data for oh and h@xmath5o masers as well as co thermal emission .",
    "all are properly explained by the model results .",
    "the sio data is displaced from the wind velocity profile , as expected for this maser s location inside the dust formation zone ( cf elitzur 1992 ) .",
    "the only required input quantities that remain unknown are the gas temperature and water abundance , and we fit those simultaneously from the water line observations .",
    "we calculate the temperature from the balance of cooling and heating due to adiabatic expansion , grain - gas collisions and h@xmath5o rovibrational transitions ( we estimate the h@xmath5 vibrational contribution and find it negligible ) .",
    "we solve for the populations of the lowest 45 rotational levels of the ground vibrational state of ortho- and para - water ; this accounts for all levels with energy @xmath14 2000 k above ground .",
    "the molecular data are from the hitran database @xcite , the collision rate coefficients from @xcite .",
    "the level populations and line emissivities are calculated with the escape probability method as functions of distance @xmath15 , and the line fluxes by integrating the line emissivities over the shell volume .",
    "the free parameters are the abundances of the two water species , which must be considered independently since there is no radiative coupling between them .",
    "detailed modeling shows that these abundances are constant in the region where the water emission originates ( cn , tb ) .",
    "because of the central role of h@xmath5o in the energy balance , the calculations of the temperature and water line emission are coupled , and repeated until the best fit achieved for the line observations .",
    "the best fit is found for water abundance @xmath16 = 1.0 and the ratio ortho : para = 1:1.3 .",
    "figure 3 shows the temperature profile .",
    "the model parameters are summarized in table 1 , results and comparison with observations in table 2 .",
    "our model fits all the water lines within the observational errors , which generally exceed 50% .",
    "the quality of the fit for the lws data is comparable to that of the b96 model . for the sws data",
    "n96 present a range of models for each line , and our model fits that data set better than any single one of them .",
    "therefore , our model resolves the conflict among the previous water line calculations , fitting all the data with a single value for the mass loss rate .",
    "it is important to note that  is determined by the infrared data and , and remains unchanged during the modeling of the water lines .",
    "we find that the acceptable range of  is  23  yr@xmath0 , with a nominal value of 2.3  yr@xmath0 . except for the high - end of the n96 range , most estimates of  are in agreement with ours within the errors ( cf n96 and references therein ) .",
    "the source of the large discrepancy with n96 is not clear .",
    "neufeld et al suggest that the temperature profile could be the reason , but this does not seem to be the case .",
    "our temperature profile is not that different from the cn profile , which was used in the n96 study , especially in the relevant range @xmath17 k ( figure [ fig : tgas ] ) .",
    "we compared the various contributions to heating and cooling with those listed by cn and @xcite , and find good agreement ; the difference in resulting profiles can be attributed to the different parameters used in the two calculations ( cn used  = 3  yr@xmath0 ) .",
    "the two profiles differ much more with the gs profile employed in the b96 model , which produced  similar to ours .",
    "we suspect that a more important source of difference could be the radiation field , since radiative excitations play an important role in the water population distribution .",
    "a comparison is impossible since n96 do not give details of the radiation field they employed .",
    "a proper radiation field appears crucial for the water line calculations .",
    "the uncertainty in fitted parameters depends on the particular observations that constrain them .",
    "we estimate that the acceptable range for  is  850@xmath18100 .",
    "we experimented with both power - law and single - size ( @xmath19 = 0.1 ) grain distributions and found the differences negligible .",
    "the large uncertainties in the measured line fluxes translate into a large uncertainty in the abundances of the two species of water . between the two , the",
    "para - h@xmath5o abundance is subject to the larger uncertainty and can vary by as much as factor 3 , so that the ortho : para ratio can be anywhere from 1 to 1/3 . by comparison , b96 obtained 1 for this ratio .",
    "all of these results differ greatly from the thermodynamic limit of 3 .",
    "depending on the ortho : para ratio , we find acceptable models for @xmath20 in the range 14 .    in the modeling efforts of both b96 and n96 ,",
    "was one of numerous free parameters fitted from the water line observations .",
    "the scaling approach taken here reduces the number of free parameters to the essential minimum and determines  prior to the water line fitting .",
    "table 1 breaks the model parameters into three categories .",
    "quantities in the first division are specified as input , in addition to the ir and water observations .",
    "the second group includes the free parameters of our two fitting procedures while the third group lists results derived from our fits .",
    "given grain properties , the ir observations are fitted with the three free parameters ,  and @xmath10 and the single independent input . the resulting model determines also the dimensionless velocity profile . adding as independent input the source distance and the wind final velocity , the model results determine the full velocity profile , and  determines also  and the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "fitting the water lines involves no other input and only two free parameters  the ortho- and para - water abundances . thanks to the central role of water lines in the gas temperature calculation ,",
    "the gas temperature is determined self - consistently as part of this second fitting procedure . since the only free parameters in fitting the observed water fluxes are the abundances of the two species , confidence in the derived values",
    "is greatly enhanced . in principle , we could have used  as a free parameter in the water calculations , as in the previous studies . in that case",
    ", consistency between the results of the two fitting procedures would be used as an additional constraint , automatically met by our calculation .    while radiation pressure on the dust grains is generally accepted as the driving mechanism behind the wind expansion",
    ", this mechanism has not been fully tested .",
    "the solutions of radiative transfer and the hydrodynamics problems must result in the same parameters , but this fundamental test has not been performed thus far ; self - consistent modeling of both the ir emission and the wind structure in the same source has not yet been attempted . the most detailed previous calculation we are aware off is the tb modeling of r cas .",
    "however , in that work the radiation field was not calculated self - consistently , instead it was derived from a dust temperature profile that was assumed beforehand as an input property . in contrast , dusty determines this temperature from a proper calculation of radiative equilibrium coupled to the radiative transfer including dust scattering , absorption and emission .",
    "the spectral energy distribution is fitted with just three free parameters , only one of which ( ) is significant .",
    "once these parameters are set , the outflow terminal velocity determines the entire velocity profile without any more freedom in the model .",
    "it is highly significant that a single self - consistent model with the minimal necessary number of parameters provides agreement with both the spectral energy distribution and the molecular velocity observations .",
    "apart from resolving the  discrepancy in w hya , the success of our model provides strong support for the basic paradigm of winds in late - type stars .",
    "we thank michael barlow for the iso lws spectrum of w hya , david neufeld for help with the water molecular data , eljko ivezi for his comments on the manuscript and the referee for useful suggestions and for pointing out the hipparcos distance measurement .",
    "the partial support of nasa and nsf is gratefully acknowledged .",
