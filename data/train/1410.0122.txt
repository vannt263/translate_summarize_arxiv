    "numerous theories beyond the standard model of particle physics predict the existence of new light scalar bosons @xcite such as the axions theory @xcite developed to solve the strong cp problem .",
    "any new scalar of mass @xmath1 could mediate a short - range monopole - dipole cp - violating interaction between two nucleons defined by the potential @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the spin of the nucleon , @xmath4 the mass of the polarized particle , @xmath5 and @xmath6 the coupling constant at the vertices of polarized and unpolarized particles corresponding to a scalar and a pseudoscalar interactions . as a consequence ,",
    "the range of such interaction is @xmath7 which makes this force macroscopically observable for light bosons .",
    "finding a new boson or a new short - range interaction interaction would be a important discovery in fundamental physics , since it could solve problems such as the nature of the dark matter ( as a wisp candidate ) .",
    "this new force is thus actively searched for around the world through different kind of experiments ( using torsion - balance , studying the newton s inverse square law or looking at bouncing ultracold neutrons ) .",
    "consider a cell filled with polarized @xmath0he immersed into a static magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "the natural depolarization of the gas is quantified by the longitudinal spin relaxation rate @xmath9 , resulting from the main contributions : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the relaxation rate induced by collisions of polarized atoms on the cell walls , @xmath12 the relaxation rate due to interparticles collisions and @xmath13 the depolarization rate due to the motion of polarized particles in an inhomogeneous magnetic field",
    ".    in our case , the axionlike interaction acts like a macroscopic pseudomagnetic field .",
    "the glass walls of the cell would act as a source of the pseudomagnetic field .",
    "the induced inhomogeneities can depolarize an initially polarized gas in addition to the natural depolarization phenomena inducing @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of such a new interaction could be revealed as an anomalous depolarization channel with a non - standard dependence on the holding magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "helium 3 is a gas which can be hypolarized ( up to @xmath14 polarization ) and whose polarization remains during more than 5 days under certain conditions . in physics , @xmath0he is commonly used as a spin - filter for neutrons @xcite , as a target for electron beam @xcite , as a precision magnetometer @xcite and as a probe for new fundamental spin - dependent interactions @xcite . in medicine and engineering ,",
    "it is used for magnetic resonance imaging @xcite .",
    "it also has been used as a atomic zero - field magnetometer @xcite .    to polarize atoms ,",
    "essentially two methods are commonly used , both with optical pumping .",
    "since the @xmath0he atoms have a nuclear polarization and so they can not be optically pumped directly in their ground state , one have to use an extra specie which can be . in the spin - exchange optical pumping ( seop )",
    "method , rubidium is pumped with a @xmath15 laser and then collisionally polarizes the helium atoms .",
    "another method is the metastability exchange optical pumping ( meop ) where an electric discharge excites the @xmath0he atoms into a metastable state which can be optically pumped with a @xmath16 right circular polarized laser .",
    "the metastable polarized atoms then exchange their metastability with ground state helium atoms , leading to a polarized gas . the @xmath0he meop station `` tyrex '' is located at the institut laue langevin and is one of the best polarized @xmath0he source in the world in terms of polarization and density of polarized atoms .",
    "since the meop method operates at few hundreds of millibar , a compressor is used to extract polarized atoms and to fill dedicated cells : pressures up to @xmath17 at @xmath18 polarization can be reached .",
    "a first test experiment @xcite measuring the spin longitudinal depolarization rate @xmath19 as a function of the applied field @xmath8 ( shown on the figure [ oldrelaxfigure ] ) was performed in 2010 to demonstrate the sensitivity of the method .",
    "a new dedicated experiment will be set up at the institute laure langevin , improving both ( i ) the magnetic environment of the experiment and ( ii ) the measurement of the decay of polarization .",
    "relaxation rate depending on the holding magnetic field @xmath8 for the previous experiment presented in @xcite with a cylindrical cell containing @xmath0he gas at @xmath20 with a radius @xmath21 and a length @xmath22 . ]    in the first test experiment , ( i ) was the limiting factor . concerning ( ii )",
    ", one can improve the sensitivity using polarimetry of the polarized gas at high pressure .      under certain conditions of pressure , intensity of the holding magnetic field and dynamics of particles in the cell , the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath13 due to particles motion in the magnetic field inhomogeneities",
    "can be expressed as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the diffusion coefficient of the @xmath0he gas and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the components of the magnetic field inhomogeneities , transversal to the holding magnetic field @xmath8 . in order to suppress the magnetic field inhomogeneity depolarization channel",
    ", one can decrease the diffusion coefficient by increasing the gas pressure . having a holding magnetic field as homogeneous as possible",
    "will also help to decrease @xmath13 .    the new apparatus ( see fig . [ fig : experiment ] )",
    "is composed of a 5 meter long and 80 cm diameter solenoid which provides a very homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "this solenoid is inserted into a @xmath27-metal magnetic shield of 96 cm diameter in order to shield the center of the solenoid from external magnetic fields .",

    "this improvement will directly affect the duration of the experiment and so the precision of the relaxation rate measurement technique , which is described below .",
    "the magnetic environment characterization is still under progress .",
    "there are various way to measure the longitudinal relaxation rate of a polarized @xmath0he gas .",
    "the most precise but the most complex one is by measuring the transmission of an unpolarized neutrons beam through the polarized gas .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is a more compact and widely used technique to measure polarization .",
    "one can measure the amplitude of the nmr response signal or can also measure the frequency shift , both proportional to the polarization .",
    "but those techniques are also less precise .",
    "a compromise of compactness and precision can be achieved with a direct polarimetry technique @xcite : it consists in measuring the magnetic field generated by the gas itself at high pressure",
    ". this magnetic field can be of order of @xmath41 which is easy to measure .",
    "moreover , by placing wisely two fluxgate magnetometers ( see fig . [",
    "fig : polarimetry ] ) and applying spin - flips to invert polarization and measure offsets , the longitudinal relaxation rate can be easily and precisely measured .",
