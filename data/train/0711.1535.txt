    "since we introduced a connection @xmath37 , we can define in the conventional way the rc - curvature , @xmath38 if we differentiate ( [ torsion ] ) and ( [ curvature ] ) , we find straightforwardly the first and the second bianchi identities , respectively , and in 4 dimensions @xmath39 independent components of the bianchi identities . ]",
    "@xmath40    we can recognize already here , how closely torsion and curvature are interrelated .",
    "moreover , it is clear , that torsion as well as well as curvature are notions linked to the process of parallel displacement on a manifold and are as such something very particular .",
    "since in the applications we have in mind the metric plays an essential role , we will now introduce  even though it is not necessary at this stage  besides the connection @xmath41 , a ( symmetric ) metric @xmath42 that determines distances and angles .",
    "the line element is given by @xmath43 we assume that the connection is compatible with the metric , i.e. , the nonmetricity @xmath44 vanishes : @xmath45 a space fulfilling this condition is called a _ riemann - cartan _ ( rc )",
    "_ space_. we can solve ( [ nonmetricity ] ) with respect to the symmetric part of the ( anholonomic ) connection : @xmath46    furthermore , we will choose an _ orthonormal coframe_. this can be done in any dimension @xmath47 .",
    "we will apply the formalism to the 4-dimensional ( 4d ) spacetime with lorentzian metric @xmath48 or to the 3d space with euclidean metric @xmath49 .",
    "then , due to ( [ symmconn ] ) , we find a vanishing symmetric part of the anholonomic connection .",
    "accordingly , we have in a rc - space as geometrical field variables the orthonormal coframe @xmath50 and the metric - compatible connection @xmath51 .",
    "now we are prepared to characterize a rc - space in the way cartan did it .",
    "locally a rc - space looks euclidean , since for any single point @xmath13 , there exist coordinates @xmath52 and an orthonormal coframe @xmath53 in a neighborhood of @xmath13 such that @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the connection 1forms referred to the coframe @xmath53 , see hartley @xcite for details .",
    "eq.([propo ] ) represents , in a rc - space , the anholonomic analogue of the ( holonomic ) riemannian normal coordinates of a riemannian space .",
    "often it is argued incorrectly that is rc - space normal frames can not exist , since torsion , as a tensor , can not be transformed to zero . in this context",
    "it is tacitly assumed that the starting point are riemannian normal coordinates and the torsion is ` superimposed ' .",
    "however , since only a _ natural _ ,",
    "i.e. , a holonomic or coordinate frame is attached to riemannian normal coordinates , one is too restrictive in the discussion right from the beginning . and , of course",
    ", the curvature is also of tensorial nature  and still riemannian normal coordinates do exist",
    ".    how can a local observer at a point p with coordinates @xmath56 tell whether his or her space carries torsion and/or curvature ? the local observer defines a small loop ( or a circuit ) originating from p and leading back to p. then he / she _ rolls _ the local reference space _ without sliding _",
    " this is called cartan displacement  along the loop and adds up successively the small relative translations and rotations , see cartan @xcite , schouten @xcite , sharpe @xcite or , for a modern application , wise @xcite . as a computation shows ,",
    "the added up _",
    "translation _ is a measure for the _ torsion _ and the _ rotation _ for the _",
    "curvature_. since the loop encircles a small 2-dimensional area element , cartan s prescription attaches to an area element a small translation and a small rotation .",
    "thus , torsion @xmath35 and curvature @xmath57 are both 2-forms in any dimensions @xmath47 , the torsion is vector - valued , because of the translation vector , the curvature bivector - valued , because of the rotations .    in this way",
    "cartan visualized a rc - space as consisting of a collection of small euclidean granules that are translated and rotated with respect to each other .",
    "intuitively it is clear that this procedure of cartan is similar to what one does in gauge field theory : a rigid ( or global ) symmetry , here the corresponding euclidean motions of translation and rotations , is extended to a local symmetry . in four - dimensional spacetime",
    "it is the poincar ( or inhomogeneous lorentz ) group of minkowski space that is gauged and that yields a rc - spacetime , see @xcite .",
    "there are two degenerate cases : a rc - space with vanishing torsion is the conventional riemannian space , a rc - space with vanishing rc - curvature is called a _ weitzenbck space _ @xcite , or a space with teleparallelism .",
    "we will come back to this notion later .",
    "we can now list the number of the components of the different geometrical quantities in a rc - space of 3 or 4 dimensions .",
    "these numbers are reflecting the @xmath58 generators of the 3d euclidean group and of the @xmath59 generators of the 4d poincar group :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of secs.1 and 2 can all be proven rigorously .",
    "they are all consequences of the introduction of a connection @xmath3 and a metric @xmath60 .",

    "see @xcite and for a historical review @xcite , consisting of structured points such that , in addition to the displacement field @xmath61 , it is possible to measure the rotation of such a structured point by the bivector field @xmath62 , see fig.2 for a schematic view .    the deformation measures _ distortion _",

    "this is the new type of spin moment stress that already surfaced in the cosserat continuum in fig.4 .",
    "it is obvious , if one enriches in geometry the curvature by the _ torsion , _ then in the dynamical side one should allow , besides stress ( in 4d energy - momentum ) , _ spin moment stress _ ( in 4d spin angular momentum ) .    the ideal reference crystal , in the sense of cartan , is the undeformed crystal of fig.9 .",
    "one can imagine to roll it along the dislocated crystal in fig.11 .",
    "then the closure failure of fig.11 is determined , provided we define the connection with respect to the lattice vectors . in dislocation theory , this is known as the frank - burgers circuit , the closure failure as the burgers vector .",

    "@xcite and krner @xcite .",
    "thus , it is an established fact that _ dislocation density _ and _ torsion _ in three dimensions can be used synonymously .",
    "[ dislfig4 ]        we recognize that at each point in a crystal with dislocations a lattice direction is well - defined , see fig.11 . in other words , a global teleparallelism is provided thereby reducing the rc - space to a weitzenbck space with vanishing rc - curvature , see fig.12 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the connection of a weitzenbck space can always be represented in terms of the components of the frame @xmath136 and the coframe @xmath137 as @xmath138 accordingly , on the one hand a dislocated crystal carries a torsion ( that is , a dislocation density ) , on the other hand it provides a teleparallelism or defines a weitzenbck space ( that is , a space with vanishing rc - curvature ) , see , e.g. , the discussion of krner @xcite .",
    "what are then the deformational measures in the field theory of dislocations , see krner @xcite ?",
    "clearly , torsion @xmath139 or contortion @xmath132 must be one measure , but what about the distortion ?",
    "we turn to the fundamental work of lazar @xcite , katanaev @xcite , and malyshev @xcite on the 3d translational gauge approach to dislocation theory .",
    "the underlying geometrical structure of the theory is the affine tangent bundle @xmath140 over the 3-dimensional base space @xmath141 .",
    "it arises when one replaces at every point of @xmath141 the usual tangent space by an affine tangent space . in the affine space",

    "we only briefly formulate the general ideas and basic results of the translational gauge approach .",
    "in accordance with the general gauge - theoretic scheme , to the three generators @xmath143 of the translation group there corresponds a lie algebra - valued 1-form @xmath144 as the translational gauge field potential . under translations @xmath145 in the affine tangent space",
    ", it transforms like a connection @xmath146 since @xmath142 is abelian , i.e. , translations commute with each other , there is no homogeneous term in this transformation law .",
    "thus , it resembles the phase transformation of an electromagnetic potential . for the same reason ,",
    "the gauge field strength @xmath147 is formally reminiscent of a generalized electromagnetic field strength .",
    "this analogy was extensively used by itin @xcite .",
    "[ dislfig3 ]    : the relative orientations of the lattice plains in 2-direction change .",

    "another important structure is a field @xmath150 defined as a local section of the affine tangent bundle .",
    "geometrically , this field determines the  origin \" of the affine spaces ; it is known as cartan s `` radius vector '' . under the gauge transformation ( translation )",
    "it changes as @xmath151 .",
    "however , the combination @xmath152 is obviously _ gauge invariant _ , see @xcite , eq.(3.3.1 ) .",
    "in a rigorous gauge - theoretic framework , the 1-form @xmath153 arises as the nonlinear translational gauge field with @xmath150 interpreted as the goldstone field describing the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry .",
    "we can consistently treat @xmath154 as the coframe of our 3d manifold .",
    "then the translational gauge field strength is actually the anholonomity 2-form of this coframe : @xmath155 .",
    "collecting our results , we have the deformation measures @xmath156    if , in linear approximation , we compare these measures with the cosserat deformation measure ( [ coss1]),([coss2 ] ) , then we find , in generalization of the cosserat structure , @xmath157 here @xmath158 represents the dislocation density ( torsion ) .",
    "hence ( [ compare4 ] ) represents nye s relation ( [ contortion ] ) , and the second deformational measure of dislocation theory with its 9 independent components corresponds to the contortion of the cosserat theory .",
    "however , as we can recognize from ( [ compare3 ] ) , the dislocated continuum requires a more general description .",
    "the 3 component cosserat rotation @xmath159 is substituted by the asymmetric 9 component ( translational gauge ) potential @xmath160 .",
    "still , the distortion @xmath110 carries also 9 independent components and the corresponding static response is represented by the asymmetric force stress @xmath161 .",
    "if the second deformation measure in dislocation theory were , similar to the cosserat theory , the gradient of @xmath160 , i.e. , @xmath162 , it would have 27 independent components and the static responses would be represented hyperstresses with and without moments , see @xcite . however , as it turns out , see ( [ compare4 ] )  and this is very decisive  it is the dislocation density ( torsion ) , i.e. , the _ curl _ of @xmath163 , with only 9 independent components that plays a role . for this reason , the static response in dislocation theory are again , as in a cosserat continuum , just spin moment stresses @xmath164 , see @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath84 is equivalent to @xmath165 .",
    "thus , in dislocation theory as well as in the cosserat continuum , we have the same type of stresses @xmath166 and @xmath167 in spite of the newly emerging 9 component field @xmath163 .",
    "continuum theories of _ moving dislocations _ are still a developing subject , see , e.g. , lazar @xcite and lazar & anastassiadis @xcite ( and the literature quoted therein ) .",
    "probably it is fair to say that they did nt find too many real applications so far .",
    "nevertheless , the identification of the dislocation density with the torsion is invariably a cornerstone of all these theories .",
    "the construction of a translation gauge theory does not depend on the dimension of the underlying space .",
    "hence we can take in 4d spacetime the same fundamental formulas ( [ radius]),([anh ] ) .",
    "incidentally , the construction of the gauge theory for the group of translations is quite nontrivial because the local spacetime translations look very similar to the diffeomorphisms of spacetime .",

    "they satisfy the trivial cartan relations : @xmath241 the right - hand sides , given by the torsion and the curvature 2-forms , respectively , vanish for the euclidean space .",
    "we now consider an infinitesimal deformation of this manifold produced by the  generalized gauge transformation \" which is defined as a combination of the diffeomorphism and of the local rotation .",
    "the diffeomorphism is generated by some vector field , whereas the rotation is given by the @xmath242 matrix which acts on the anholonomic ( greek indices ) components .",
    "we assume that a deformation is small which means that we only need to consider the infinitesimal diffeomorphism and rotational transformations . by definition ,",
    "the deformation is the sum of the two infinitesimal gauge transformations : @xmath243 let @xmath14 be an arbitrary vector field , and we recall that a diffeomorphism , generated by it , is described by the lie derivative along this vector field , i.e. , @xmath244 . as for the local rotations , they are given by the standard transformation formulas , @xmath245 here @xmath246 is the covariant derivative defined by the connection @xmath247 .",
    "for the lie derivative of the coframe we find ( with @xmath248 ) @xmath249 we used here ( [ zerot ] ) because the space is euclidean . substituting ( [ ellvta ] ) together with ( [ rot ] ) into ( [ defvta ] ) , we find for the translational deformation @xmath250 here we introduced @xmath251 .",
    "analogously we have for the lie derivative of the connection @xmath252 we again used here ( [ zeror ] ) for the euclidean space .",
    "now , substituting ( [ ellgam ] ) together with ( [ rot ] ) into ( [ defgam ] ) , we find for the rotational deformation @xmath253    we thus recovered the deformation measures ( [ coss1]),([coss2 ] ) of the linear cosserat continuum . using local coordinates , we expand @xmath254 , and then ( [ trdef ] ) and ( [ rotdef ] ) reduce in tensor components to @xmath255 thus , the deformation measures of the cosserat continuum are literally given by the deformations of coframe and connection ( [ defvta])-([defgam ] ) .",
    "the compatibility conditions ( [ compat ] ) can be derived from ( [ trdef ] ) and ( [ rotdef ] ) by applying the covariant derivative .",
    "the result reads @xmath256 the crucial point is that the geometry of the space is euclidean and flat .",
    "when , however , the space has a nontrivial riemann - cartan geometry with the coframe @xmath171 and connection @xmath188 satisfy cartan s structure equations with the nontrivial torsion @xmath257 and curvature @xmath258 , the deformation measures are given by @xmath259 and they no longer satisfy the compatibility conditions ( [ compati ] ) . in 4d , after suitably adjusting the signs , eqs.([meas1 ] ) and ( [ meas2 ] ) coincide with the poincar gauge transformations ( [ pg1 ] ) , ( [ pg2 ] ) .",
