    "there are a number of models of interest which suffer from a very severe sign problem .",
    "this includes qcd and other field theories with a non - zero chemical potential or a non - zero vacuum angle or odd numbers of fermion flavors , frustrated quantum spin systems , like the quantum antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field , and models for strongly - correlated electrons , like the hubbard model for high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "these models have a boltzmann weight which can be negative or even complex and so can not be interpreted as a probability .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome in numerical simulations by including the sign or phase of the boltzmann weight with observables .",
    "unfortunately , this leads to large cancellations and gives exponentially small observables .",
    "this requires exponentially large statistics , which makes it in practice impossible to simulate these models numerically .",
    "recently , a new technique has been developed , called meron - cluster algorithms @xcite , which completely solves the sign problem for some of these models @xcite .",
    "it identifies the origin of the sign problem with properties of the clusters , which enables it to be eliminated .",
    "cluster algorithms in general are extremely efficient at exploring configuration spaces and very often do not suffer from critical slowing down as a phase transition is approached , unlike many other algorithms . for example , in this and previous papers , we can work directly in the chiral limit with massless fermions .",
    "combined with the ability to construct improved estimators , we can perform a high precision study of these models with only modest statistics .    in this paper",
    ", we explore a model of @xmath0 flavor of staggered fermions in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions with a four - fermion interaction .",
    "this model has a very severe sign problem and can not be simulated with standard techniques .",
    "we build a meron - cluster algorithm , which we use to perform a high - precision study .",
    "we find that the @xmath1 chiral symmetry of this model is spontaneously broken at low temperatures and , using finite - size scaling analysis , we verify that the finite - temperature chiral phase transition is in the universality class of the 2-d ising model .",
    "a recent study of the same model with @xmath1 chiral symmetry in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions has shown , using a meron - cluster algorithm , that a finite temperature chiral phase transition occurs which has the universal behavior of the 3-d ising model @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper concerns a different universality class and also constructs more observables than were previously considered .",
    "the identification of the finite temperature critical behavior is not entirely straightforward @xcite .",
    "a model of @xmath2 fermion flavors with a four - fermion interaction shows mean - field behavior in the @xmath3 limit . on the other hand , at finite @xmath2",
    "one finds the non - trivial critical behavior that one expects based on dimensional reduction and standard universality arguments . for example , in @xcite it has been verified that the chiral phase transition in a @xmath4-d four - fermion interaction model with @xmath5 flavors and @xmath1 chiral symmetry is in the universality class of the 2-d ising model . due to the fermion sign problem , standard fermion simulation methods often do not work in models with too small a number of flavors .",
    "the work presented in this paper shows that the same universal behavior holds for @xmath0 flavor .",
    "the standard technique to deal with fermions in monte - carlo simulations is to integrate them out , resulting in a non - local bosonic theory .",
    "the meron - cluster algorithm does not integrate out the fermions , instead we describe them with a local theory using a fock space basis of occupation number .",
    "the fermion sign arises as a non - local property due to the permutation of fermion world lines . using probabilistic rules , we connect neighboring lattice sites , producing closed loops , which are the clusters .",
    "a cluster is flipped by making all of its occupied sites empty and its empty ones occupied .",
    "such a cluster flip can change the fermion sign by changing the permutation of fermion world lines .",
    "a cluster whose flip changes the sign we call a meron . we can tell if a cluster is a meron simply from its structure .",
    "a typical configuration contains many merons , yet the observables of interest are only non - zero for configurations with very few or no merons .",
    "the signals from standard monte carlo algorithms are so exponentially small because the markov chain explores a vast configuration space , yet only an exponentially small sub - space makes _ any _ contribution to measurables . by restricting ourselves to only explore the relevant sub - space",
    ", we completely solve the sign problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we present the fermionic model which we have studied , calculate its partition function using the hamiltonian formulation and find that there is a sign problem . in section 3 , we describe briefly the meron - cluster algorithm which we have used to perform numerical simulations of this model .",
    "we present the results of the simulations in section 4 and give our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we consider staggered fermions in the hamiltonian formulation on a 2-dimensional spatial lattice of extent @xmath6 , which is even .",
    "the hamiltonian operator is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the standard kawamoto - smit phases for staggered fermions and @xmath10 is a constant .",
    "the fermionic operators satisfy the usual anticommutation relations @xmath11 .",
    "the same model in ( 3 + 1)-dimensions was explored in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to this paper , where various features of the model and the meron - cluster algorithm are discussed in more detail than we give here .",
    "in the hamiltonian formulation of the theory , fermion doubling on the lattice occurs only in the spatial dimensions . using staggered fermions ,",
    "the dirac components of a spinor are distributed spatially , reducing the number of fermion flavors by a factor of four .",
    "thus this ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model contains @xmath0 fermion flavor .",
    "the model has a global @xmath12 symmetry corresponding to conserved particle number , as the total particle number operator commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath13 = 0.\\ ] ] furthermore the hamiltonian has , for @xmath14 , a discrete @xmath1 symmetry corresponding to shifts by one lattice spacing .",
    "however the mass term breaks that symmetry explicitly . for a single flavor of massless fermions ,",
    "the symmetry of the lattice model is @xmath15 and we refer to the discrete symmetry as chiral symmetry . in the continuum , a single massless fermion flavor has a @xmath12 axial symmetry ( there is no gauge interaction , so this symmetry is not anomalously broken ) .",
    "the discrete @xmath1 symmetry is the lattice remnant of this continuous symmetry . from now on , we set @xmath14 and explore the behavior of the chiral symmetry of this model .",
    "the symmetries of staggered fermions are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "if the @xmath1 chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken at some finite temperature , from universality we expect this to be a second - order phase transition .",
    "as the critical point is approached , the correlation length @xmath16 diverges and the system becomes insensitive to the time extent .",
    "due to dimensional reduction , we expect a finite - temperature chiral phase transition in this model to belong to the 2-d ising universality class .",

    "we note that it is not actually necessary to discretize the time direction , as it is possible to work directly in the euclidean time continuum @xcite",
    ".    we can equivalently describe this model with bosonic operators , using a transformation by jordan and wigner @xcite .",
    "we order the lattice sites on each time slice arbitrarily into a chain , which can be done in any number of spatial dimensions .",
    "for example , a possible ordering of points in two spatial dimensions is by an index @xmath23 .",

    "configurations which have an odd permutation of fermion world lines have a negative sign .",
    "this sign leads to very large cancellations in observables and usually makes it impossible to make accurate measurements in numerical simulations .",
    "the meron - cluster algorithm decomposes every configuration into closed loops of connected sites , each loop being a cluster . loops which change the fermion sign when flipped are identified as meron - clusters .",
    "a meron - cluster identifies a pair of configurations with equal weight and opposite sign .",
    "this results in an exact cancellation of two contributions @xmath85 to the path integral , such that only configurations without merons contribute to the partition function .",
    "observables only receive contributions from configurations which contain very few or no merons , whereas the vast majority of configurations contain many merons . by only exploring the sectors of configuration space with the relevant numbers of merons",
    ", one makes an exponential gain in statistics .",
    "combined with efficient re - weighting of the remaining meron sectors , this completely solves the sign problem .",
    "cluster algorithms are extremely efficient at exploring configuration spaces and generating uncorrelated configurations and generally do not suffer from critical slowing down . even in models without a sign problem , the meron - cluster algorithm is more efficient than standard fermion simulation methods .    in this paper , we examined a model of @xmath0 flavor of staggered fermions in @xmath4-dimensions , which has a @xmath1 chiral symmetry .",
    "the model has a very severe sign problem and can not be solved by standard fermion simulation algorithms . using a meron - cluster algorithm",
    ", we were able to make high - precision measurements of the chiral susceptibility and binder cumulant even in very large volumes and low temperatures . in order to perform an accurate and reliable finite - size scaling analysis , it was necessary to go to volumes so large , where the sign problem is so severe , that a standard algorithm would require statistics on the order of @xmath130 to attain a similar accuracy .",
    "we were able to verify that the model undergoes a finite - temperature chiral phase transition , which belongs to the universality class of the @xmath161d ising model .",
    "this is the behavior expected from dimensional reduction and universality .",
    "the same universal behavior was observed in the @xmath5 flavor case @xcite .",
    "however , the standard fermion algorithm that was used in that study does not work for @xmath162 due to the fermion sign problem .",
    "it is quite natural to use cluster algorithms in models of discrete variables .",
    "a future possible application of the meron - cluster algorithm is in exploring quantum link models @xcite which are used in the d - theory formulation of qcd @xcite . in d - theory ,",
    "a model of discrete quantum variables undergoes dimensional reduction , resulting in an effective theory of continuous classical variables . in quantum link",
    "qcd the quarks arise as domain wall fermions .",
    "the application of meron - cluster algorithms to domain wall fermions is in progress .",
    "also there are many applications to sign problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "investigations of antiferromagnets in a magnetic field and of systems in the hubbard model family are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "at present , the meron - cluster algorithm is the only method that allows us to solve the fermion sign problem .",
    "a severe sign problem arises in lattice qcd calculations at non - zero baryon number due to a complex action .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if our algorithm can be applied to this case . at non - zero chemical potential",
    "the 2-d @xmath79 model , which is a toy model for qcd , also suffers from a sign problem due to a complex action .",
    "when applied to the d - theory formulation of this model , the meron - cluster algorithm solves the sign problem completely @xcite .",
    "it is an open question if such progress can be made in investigations of qcd .",
