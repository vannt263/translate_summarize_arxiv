    "dwarf elliptical ( de ) galaxies are the dominant galaxy type in nearby galaxy clusters , accounting for more than 75% of all objects in these regions down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by low effective surface brightness @xmath5  mag  arcsec@xmath6 and faint luminosities @xmath7 ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "unlike classical elliptical galaxies whose surface brightness profiles tend to be well fit by the de  vaucouleurs @xmath8 law @xcite , des have brightness profiles that are characterized by srsic profiles @xcite with indices ranging between @xmath93 ( where @xmath9 corresponds to an exponential law and @xmath10 to an @xmath8 law ) making them appear more diffuse than classical ellipticals of the same total magnitude .",
    "a direct illustration of this is the discontinuity in surface brightness between des and the low luminosity end of classical elliptical galaxy sequence ( kormendy 1985 ; bender , burstein , & faber 1992 ; however , see graham & guzman  2003 ) .",
    "detailed studies of the internal dynamics of local group des have been carried out over the past two decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but , until recently , only integrated measurements were available for more distant des @xcite",
    ". the number of des outside the local group with spatially - resolved measurements of internal kinematics has increased dramatically in the last few years @xcite .",
    "these observations have revealed an intriguing diversity of properties : several des in the virgo and fornax clusters appear to be roughly consistent with rotational flattening , while others have no detectable rotation similar to their local group counterparts @xcite .",
    "this range in rotation velocities is a newly found feature of cluster des that must be explained by theoretical models of their formation .",
    "formation scenarios for de galaxies fall into two broad categories : ( 1 )  des are old , primordial objects , and ( 2 )  des have recently evolved or transformed from a progenitor galaxy population .",
    "two independent lines of observational evidence favor the latter category .",
    "primordial dwarf galaxies are expected to be less strongly clustered than massive galaxies in the context of hierarchical structure formation theories , whereas the de - to - giant galaxy ratio is observed to be higher in regions of higher galaxy density @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity distribution of galaxies in the virgo cluster suggests that des may be a recently accreted population @xcite .    from simulations ,",
    "@xcite suggest that galaxy harassment in clusters can morphologically transform a spiral galaxy into a de .",
    "recent observations of embedded disks in a handful of virgo and fornax des support this model @xcite .",
    "galaxy harassment partially disrupts the rotational motion of the progenitor galaxy while increasing velocity dispersions , and is expected to result in a range of rotational velocities .",
    "it is yet unclear whether this scenario can reproduce the large fraction of des with extremely low rotational velocities @xcite .",
    "another model suggests that gas - rich dwarf irregular and/or small spiral galaxies are transformed into des through the process of ram pressure stripping @xcite . in this case , des would be expected to largely retain the rotational properties of their progenitors .",
    "the degree of rotational support present in de galaxies is thus a strong constraint on formation models .",
    "we investigate whether or not de properties such as morphology , stellar population , and local environment are correlated with the degree of internal rotation . a sample of 17 des in the virgo cluster forms the basis of this study . in ",

    "[ sec_environ ] , we compare the local environments of rotating and non - rotating des within the virgo cluster .",
    "finally , in  [ sec_discuss ] , we argue that major axis rotation velocity appears to be uncorrelated with other internal properties and local environment for the des in our sample , and discuss the broader implications of these results .    throughout this paper a virgo cluster true distance modulus of @xmath11 is adopted , i.e. ,  a distance of 15.3  mpc , as determined by the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "the general properties of the full sample are listed in table  1 .",
    "the distribution of the des on the sky and in velocity space are shown in figure  [ fig_vcc ] .",
    "the galaxies lie primarily near the bright end of the de luminosity function and were chosen to cover a range of ellipticities .",
    "all but three of the galaxies discussed in this paper were classified as `` de '' by @xcite .",
    "these three galaxies are included in our sample as they lie in the region of the fundamental plane typical for des ( figure  [ fig_fp ] ) .",
    "two of these objects , vcc  1386 and vcc  1488 , were classified as normal ellipticals with an uncertainty flag ( e : ) , but are likely to be misclassified des .",
    "the third object , vcc  1036 , was classified as a transition de / ds0 galaxy ; however , as we discuss in  [ sec_morph ] , the presence of disks and other substructure may be fairly common among des . in several of our figures ,",
    "we include two additional galaxies , vcc  1122 and vcc  1407 @xcite .",
    "these are the only other virgo cluster galaxies with published spatially - resolved internal kinematics outside our sample that are classified as `` de '' by @xcite .",
    "eleven de galaxies were observed on 2002 march 1011 using the keck  ii 10-m telescope and the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the observing setup was identical to that for the six additional virgo des presented in @xcite .",
    "observations were made in the echellette mode with continuous wavelength coverage over the range @xmath13@xmath14 across 10  echelle orders with a spectral dispersion of 11.4 km  s@xmath15  pixel@xmath15 .",
    "the spectra were obtained through a @xmath16 slit , resulting in an instrumental resolution of 23 km  s@xmath15  ( gaussian sigma ) over the entire spectrum .",

    "the esi data were reduced using a combination of iraf echelle and long - slit spectral reduction tasks .",
    "this is described in detail in @xcite ; a brief summary is given here .",
    "the sum of a bright calibration star exposure and a flat field exposure were used to trace a fiducial point and the ends of the slit for each of the 10  curved echelle orders .",
    "after overscan and dark frame subtraction , scattered light was subtracted from individual frames by fitting a smooth function to the areas outside the apertures corresponding to the echelle orders ( as defined by the tracing of the slit ends ) . to preserve spatial information ,",
    "the apall task was used in `` strip '' mode to extract and rectify two - dimensional rectangular strips for each echelle order .",
    "the rectified orders for both data and calibration frames were then interpolated to a common spatial pixel scale of @xmath19 per pixel .",
    "data reduction was carried out on these rectified strips .",
    "each strip was divided by its corresponding normalized flat - field image .",
    "individual exposures were cleaned of cosmic rays and combined .",
    "cosmic rays were easily distinguished from night sky lines even after the slight smearing caused by interpolation during the rectification process .",
    "a two - dimensional wavelength solution was determined for each rectified echelle order from a combined cu / ar / hg / ne arc lamp spectrum .",
    "the wavelength solution was applied to the data ( to render vertical lines of constant wavelength ) using either a logarithmic wavelength interpolation scheme ( with 11.4 km  s@xmath15  pixels ) or linear interpolation ( with @xmath20pixels ) for the kinematic and line strength analyses , respectively .",
    "the sky spectrum was determined for each combined frame from a @xmath21-wide section near the end of the slit farthest from the galaxy center ( @xmath22 ) , and subtracted from the rest of the two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the galaxy data were extracted into one - dimensional spectra in spatial ( radial ) bins to achieve a signal - to - noise level of @xmath23 per pixel in all radial bins , while ensuring that the spatial bin size is at least as large as the fwhm of seeing during the observations ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the galaxy continuum flux in each order of each one - dimensional spectrum was then individually normalized to unity .",
    "finally , the strips from the different echelle orders were combined , weighted by the noise frame , to create a single two - dimensional long - slit spectrum .",
    "the reddest and two bluest echelle orders were not included in the analysis due to low signal - to - noise ; the final combined spectrum covers @xmath25 .",
    "the mean line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersion as a function of radius were determined using a pixel - fitting method described in @xcite . as demonstrated in @xcite , internal velocity dispersions from this observing setup can be measured down to the instrumental resolution of 23  km  s@xmath15  with an accuracy of @xmath26% .",
    "velocity profiles were recovered using template stars ranging in spectral type from g8iii to m0iii .",
    "the best fitting template stars , hd48433 and hd40460 ( both k1iii stars with [ fe / h ] = @xmath27 and @xmath28  dex , respectively ) were used to recover the velocity and velocity dispersion profiles presented in  [ sec_kin ] .",
    "imaging for the above spectroscopic de sample came from two sources : archival _ hst _ wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) images were available for five of the des , while the remaining six were imaged with esi during our spectroscopic run .",
    "the wfpc2 data , first presented in @xcite and @xcite , consist of @xmath29-s wfpc2 images in the f555w ( @xmath30 ) bandpass , except in the case of vcc  1261 where only archival wfpc2 f702w ( @xmath31-band ) imaging was available @xcite ; photometric parameters for this galaxy were transformed to @xmath30-band assuming @xmath32 = 0.5 @xcite .",
    "the wfpc2 images were cleaned of cosmic rays and combined ; instrumental magnitudes were calibrated to standard passbands using the transformations of @xcite .",

    ", esi has @xmath35 pixels and a @xmath36 field - of - view .",
    "the esi images were bias subtracted and flat fielded using twilight sky exposures .",
    "photometric zero - points were determined based on observations of standard star fields taken on a different ( but also photometric ) night ; our surface photometry and total magnitudes agree with previously published values .",
    "surface brightness profiles were determined for all galaxies using the iraf ellipse isophotal fitting routine @xcite .",

    "a srsic index @xmath9 represents an exponential profile and @xmath10 is a de  vaucouleurs law .",
    "the best - fit srsic profile is determined by non - linear least - squares fitting to the region @xmath40 ; in this region , contributions from the nucleus and effects of the different spatial resolution of esi and wfpc2 should be negligible .",
    "srsic indices , half - light effective radii and effective surface brightnesses are listed in table  3 .",
    "the average ellipticity and @xmath41-parameter ( discussed in  [ sec_morph ] ) also listed in this table were determined over the same radial range .",
    "kinematic profiles for the eleven virgo cluster des are presented in figures  [ fig_rot ] and [ fig_nrot ] . we have separately plotted des with significant rotation velocities and those which show no evidence for substantial rotation along the major axis ( @xmath42 km  s@xmath15 , or @xmath43 see below ) . for the former kinematic profiles ( figure  [ fig_rot ] )",
    ", our observations do not reach out to a large enough radius in three out of four des to observe a turnover in the rotation curve ; in these galaxies we measure only a lower limit to the maximum rotational velocity .",
    "we argue below that our observations are not far from the turnover radius .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity ( @xmath44 ) are quoted as lower limits in table  1 and shown as up - arrows in figure  [ fig_vsigma ] . for galaxies which show no evidence for substantial rotation ( figure  [ fig_nrot ] )",
    ", we estimate the upper limit on the maximum rotation velocity by differencing the average velocities on either side of the major axis of the galaxy and dividing by two .",
    "error bars on rotational motion were determined by adding in quadrature the error of the mean velocity on either side of the major axis .",
    "these quantities along with the heliocentric velocity and velocity dispersion are listed in table  1 .",
    "we note that five des in our combined sample ( vcc  543 , vcc  856 , vcc  1036 , vcc  1087 , vcc  1261 ) have been previously observed by @xcite and/or @xcite .",
    "our kinematic profiles are entirely consistent with these measurements . due to the higher spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ratio of our observations , we are able to place significantly tighter constraints on the rotational velocity for two of these galaxies . in all cases",
    ", we obtain a more accurate estimate of the velocity dispersions .    for the de profiles in figure  [ fig_nrot ] , it is difficult to explain the lack of observed major axis rotation as being a result of insufficient radial coverage .",
    "the majority of our kinematic profiles are measured out to between 0.51.0 @xmath37 .",
    "two - integral dynamical models predict that if these galaxies were oblate , isotropic rotators we should have reached or measured beyond the maximum rotation velocity at these radii ( see figures 89 in * ? ? ?",
    "although these models are based on the specific case of density profiles with @xmath45 at large radii and a varying inner cusp slope , the predictions for @xmath46 are generic and should not be very different for a srsic profile ( as is more appropriate for de galaxies ) . as an example , we measure the velocity profile of the de3 galaxy vcc  1261 out to its effective radius of @xmath47 ( figure  [ fig_nrot ] ) . as we discuss below",
    ", if the observed flattening in this galaxy was due to rotation , we would expect @xmath48 , implying a maximum rotation velocity of 30 km  s@xmath15given the average dispersion velocity of 45 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the measured upper limit on rotation in vcc  1261 of 0.5 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "conversely , for the four profiles with measurable rotation velocities ( figure  [ fig_rot ] ) , it is not surprising that we observe a turnover in the rotation curve for only one out of four strongly rotating galaxies ( vcc  856 ) . for these des ,",
    "we only have kinematic data out to @xmath49 .",
    "the models of @xcite suggest that we have barely reached the maximum rotation velocity in these systems and would need to observe a little further out in radius in order to see a turnover in these rotation curves .",
    "the rotation velocities for the these des are listed as lower limits in table  1 .    to compare the degree of rotational support in our full sample of 17 des , we plot the ratio of the maximum rotational velocity to the average velocity dispersion ( @xmath50 ) versus ellipticity ( figure  [ fig_vsigma ] , left panel ) .",
    "the solid line in this figure is the ratio expected from an oblate , isotropic , rotationally - flattened body seen edge - on ; systems that are not edge - on should have somewhat larger predicted @xmath50 values @xcite .",
    "the lower limits on @xmath50 for the four galaxies with measured rotation are consistent with rotational flattening .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath50 determined for the majority of our des are significantly smaller than expected if the observed flattenings were due to rotation and imply that these objects must be supported by anisotropic velocity dispersions . in our present sample , the degree of rotational support does not appear to be a continuous distribution : we observed either des with no measurable major axis rotation , or des with rotation velocities approaching that expected for rotational support .",
    "there is a natural division in our sample between `` rotating '' and `` non - rotating '' des ; we arbitrarily place the dividing line in our sample as galaxies with rotational support greater or less than @xmath43 .",
    "rotating and non - rotating des cover a similar range of ellipticities and absolute magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig_vsigma ] suggests that rotational support is not correlated to either of these quantities . in the remaining sections , we explore whether or not any other global de property is correlated to rotational properties .",
    "the mean velocity dispersions for the des in figures  [ fig_rot ] and [ fig_nrot ] , determined outside of @xmath51 to exclude any nuclear contributions , range between 25 and 45  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles are either constant as a function of radius or show a decrease in dispersion in the central region . as demonstrated in @xcite , such profiles can in general be adequately modeled assuming that the stellar mass density profile is equal to the luminosity density profile times a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "although spherical , isotropic models do not necessarily fit the observed velocity dispersion profiles in detail , such models do in general reproduce the overall shape of the observed de velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "dwarf elliptical galaxies lie in a region of fundamental plane space distinctly different from other stellar systems .",
    "this is best illustrated in the @xmath52-projection of the multivariate space defined by central velocity dispersion , @xmath53 , effective surface brightness , @xmath38 , and effective radius , @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_fp ] , des appear well separated from other stellar systems .",
    "@xcite argued that this separation represents a fundamental difference between the galaxy formation processes of des and more luminous classical ellipticals ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* however , for an alternate viewpoint ) . here , we are primarily interested in the relative position of our rotating and non - rotating de galaxies within fundamental plane space .    in both panels of figure  [ fig_fp ] ,",
    "the rotating and non - rotating des occupy similar regions of the fundamental plane . as a statistical comparison",
    ", we use the one - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test .",
    "this test gives the probability ( @xmath54 ) that the difference between two distributions would be as large as observed if they had been drawn from the same population .",
    "two distributions are considered different if the probability that they are drawn from the same parent distribution can be ruled out at a confidence level greater than 95% ( @xmath55 ) . as an example , the probability that the rotation velocities of our rotating and non - rotating subsamples are drawn from the same parent distribution is 0.3% ( @xmath54 = 0.003 ) ; thus this hypothesis can be ruled out at high confidence level . in comparing @xmath52-values for rotating and non - rotating des ( listed in table  3 ) ,",
    "the relatively high values of the k - s probability , @xmath54 = 0.6 , 0.2 , and 0.1 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 respectively , indicate that we can not demonstrate that these two samples are drawn from different populations .",
    "the rotating des appear slightly offset in the direction of higher @xmath56 and @xmath57 values ( corresponding to larger mass and surface brightness , respectively ) , but more data is required to establish such a correlation .",
    "evidence for underlying disk - like structure has been presented for a handful of cluster de galaxies based on deep imaging .",
    "five des in the virgo cluster show evidence for a bar or weak spiral structure @xcite and two fornax cluster de / ds0s show evidence for embedded disks @xcite .",
    "this accounts for roughly 20% of analyzed images .",
    "two of these galaxies are in our sample : @xcite discovered faint spiral structure in vcc  856 ( ic  3328 ) implying the presence of a nearly face - on disk , while @xcite presented evidence for an elongated dumbbell - shaped structure along the major axis of vcc  940 ( ic  3349 ) .",
    "the former galaxy is a rotating de in our sample , the latter is a non - rotating de . in view of these results , we analyzed all our de images to determine the level of substructure present and whether or not this is correlated with the amount of major axis rotation .",
    "images of the de galaxies in our sample appear to be smooth and without obvious signs of substructure , however , detailed analysis is required to detect possible low level substructure . as discussed in  [ sec_im ] , we determine surface brightness profiles using the iraf ellipse isophotal fitting routine .",
    "deviations from the best - fitting ellipse , often an indication of an underlying disk or other substructure , are quantified by expanding the intensity variations along the best - fitting ellipse in a fourier series as : @xmath59.\\ ] ] the first- and second - order terms ( @xmath60 ) of eqn .",

    "the quantity @xmath41 is similar to the quantity @xmath65 used by e.g. , @xcite .",
    "positive @xmath41 values indicate disky isophotes whereas negative values indicate boxy isophotes @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig_sbesi ] , we present surface brightness , ellipticity , position angle , and @xmath41 as a function of radius for those des with esi  imaging .",
    "we note that in all cases the isophotal ellipticity varies with radius ; two galaxies show significant departures from zero in their @xmath41 profiles . for the remaining des in our sample for which we have only wfpc2 imaging",
    ", we present the averaged ellipticity and @xmath41 measurements in table  3",
    ". we do not present the wfpc2 radial profiles since much of this data has been presented elsewhere @xcite , and because these images are too shallow to meaningfully constrain the amount of substructure present . as an illustration",
    ", the existing wfpc2 images do not show detectable substructure in vcc  940 ; however , as mentioned above , @xcite present clear evidence for an elongated structure along its major axis from deep ground - based imaging .    in the first column of figure  [ fig_imesi ] we present @xmath30-band esi images for the profiles presented in figure  [ fig_sbesi ] . in the second column of this figure",
    "we plot the residual image resulting from subtraction of a 2d model based on the ellipse fitting ( excluding higher - order components ) from the original image . in the third column we present unsharp - masked images created by subtracting a boxcar - smoothed image ( with @xmath66 smoothing length ) from the original , to highlight high frequency spatial structure .",
    "the unsharp - masked images have the advantage of being independent of our ellipse fitting model , but can be difficult to interpret .",
    "for example , the `` structure '' apparent in the unsharp - masked images of vcc  1947 and vcc  745 is due to ellipticity gradients evident in figure  [ fig_sbesi ] ; the model - subtracted images of these galaxies in the middle column of figure  [ fig_imesi ] show no obvious structure . on the other - hand",
    ", the model - subtracted images of two other des in figure  [ fig_imesi ] , vcc  1036 and vcc  1488 , do show clear signs of an underlying disk .",

    "these models predict line - strength indices for a wide range of metallicities ( @xmath79 \\le + 0.67 $ ]  dex ) and include predictions for both solar and non - solar element abundance ratios . in figure  [ fig_alpha ] , we investigate the [ @xmath80 ratio of our de sample by comparing the measured mgb and @xmath81 indices to model predictions . in this diagram , effects due to age and metallicity are largely degenerate and sensitivity to abundance ratio is maximized .",
    "we assume that mg traces the @xmath3-elements .",
    "the majority of des in figure  [ fig_alpha ] are consistent with solar abundance ratios , with some scatter towards both the sub- and super - solar abundance ratios between @xmath82 < + 0.3 $ ]  dex which can not be explained by differences in age and metallicity alone .",
    "we again note that the rotating and non - rotating des have similar inferred abundance ratios . @xcite",
    "first suggested that virgo des are consistent with solar abundance ratios based on a smaller de sample .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the sample of classical elliptical galaxies , taken from @xcite , also plotted in figure  [ fig_alpha ] which have super - solar abundance ratios @xmath2 \\sim + 0.3 $ ] .",
    "this difference in abundance ratios can be interpreted as a difference in the time - scale of star formation : @xmath3-elements are created rapidly by type ii supernovae while iron is produced by supernovae type ia on longer timescales .",
    "it can then be argued that the bulk of star formation in classical ellipticals occurred on much shorter timescales as compared to dwarf ellipticals .",
    "our observations are further evidence that dwarf and classical elliptical galaxies have very different star formation histories .    to determine the luminosity - weighted stellar ages and metallicities for our de sample , we plot the mgb and @xmath81 indices against h@xmath0 in figure  [ fig_ids ] .",
    "note that while conclusions based on relative line - strength differences between de galaxies are robust , the derived absolute ages and metallicities may be affected by unknown systematic errors .",
    "the best fitting age and metallicity was determined for each galaxy by simultaneously minimizing the residuals between the observed line - strengths and the predicted mgb , @xmath81 , and h@xmath0 indices from the @xcite solar abundance ratio models .",
    "the best fitting age and metallicity for our 17 de sample are 5  gyr and @xmath1 = -0.3 $ ]  dex , with rms spreads of 3  gyr and 0.1  dex , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the ages and metallicities implied by the dynamically determined @xmath30-band mass - to - light ratios , @xmath83 , calculated in @xcite for six des in the present sample ; the single - burst population models of @xcite predict @xmath30-band mass - to - light ratios in this range for the ages and metallities stated above .",
    "compared to the @xcite sample of classical elliptical galaxies plotted in figure  [ fig_ids ] , the average de in our sample has stronger h@xmath0 indices and weaker mgb and @xmath81 indices , implying these des are younger and more metal poor than a typical classical elliptical galaxy .    despite the clear separation in the fundamental plane ( see  [ sec_fp ] ) between des and classical elliptical galaxies , @xcite first noted that the magnesium line - strengths of these two galaxy types follow a tight trend with velocity dispersion .",
    "@xcite investigated this correlation for a sample of early - type galaxies which included a much larger number of galaxies with velocity dispersions less than @xmath84 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "they confirm this correlation for mgb and several other lick / ids indices .",
    "in addition , the scatter in the line - strengths of h@xmath0 , mgb , and fe5270 was found to be in excess of the measurement error for velocity dispersions less than @xmath84 km  s@xmath15 . in figure",
    "[ fig_mgsig ] , we plot line - strengths as a function of velocity dispersion .",
    "we fit a linear relation to the classical elliptical sample of @xcite and compare the result to the positions of the des in our sample .",
    "the linear fits to classical ellipticals , extrapolated to lower velocity dispersions , are consistent with our measured de line - strengths .",
    "although the observed scatter for our de sample is larger than that of the classical ellipticals , our sample size is too small to make a quantitative statement regarding the intrinsic scatter .",
    "in the above sections we have demonstrated that des with and without significant rotation velocities can not be distinguished based on their internal properties . we next examine whether or not internal rotation is correlated with a de s local environment within the virgo cluster .",
    "as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig_vcc ] , rotating and non - rotating des are found at varying radii from the center of virgo . in velocity space",
    "( figure  [ fig_vcc ] , right panels ) , the non - rotating des span the full range of radial velocities found in the virgo , whereas the rotating des appear clustered near the average virgo radial velocity of @xmath85 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "this is more clearly evident in the first panel of figure  [ fig_environ ] .",
    "based on the k - s test discussed in  [ sec_fp ] , the radial velocity distributions of the rotating versus non - rotating des are not significantly different ( @xmath86 ) , although including two additional des from the literature @xcite makes this difference marginally significant ( @xmath87 ) in the sense that rotating des have a narrower range in radial velocities . @xcite have argued that virgo cluster des as a population span a much larger range of radial velocities as compared to more luminous classical ellipticals .",
    "they interpret this as evidence that des are a more recently accreted population .",
    "if larger de samples confirm that rotating des span a narrower range of radial velocities compared to non - rotating des , this would suggest that their history in the virgo cluster is more closely associated with classical elliptical galaxies .    in the remaining panels of figure  [ fig_environ ]",
    ", we further quantify the local environment of our de sample by examining neighboring galaxies within @xmath88 ( 0.5mpc ) and 300 km  s@xmath15  of each de .",
    "these scales were chosen to probe local enhancements within the virgo cluster on the scale of small galaxy groups . as a population , virgo des are not preferentially found around larger parent galaxies @xcite in contrast to des in the field ; local overdensities or proximity to large galaxies would be evidence of recent accretion into the virgo cluster from the surrounding field / groups .",
    "we compare for the rotating and non - rotating des : the number of neighboring galaxies contained within the physical distance and velocity difference stated above , the number of luminous companions ( @xmath89 ) in this same region , and the physical distance to the nearest of these bright galaxies . in all cases ,",
    "the rotating and non - rotating des are similarly distributed based on both inspection of figure  [ fig_environ ] and results of the k - s test . in all three cases",
    "the k - s probability is greater than @xmath90 , meaning that the distribution of the two kinematic types in these panels can not be distinguished .",
    "we conclude that internal de rotation properties are not correlated with proximity to bright galaxies or the local environment within the galaxy cluster .",
    "we have established that the internal dynamics of de galaxies span a wide range in rotational support as determined from major axis spectroscopy of 17 des in the virgo cluster . in our present de sample ,",
    "the degree of rotational support does not appear to span a continuous distribution : we observe either des with no measurable major axis rotation , or des with rotation velocities approaching that expected for a rotationally - flattened object .",
    "we therefore have separated our sample into rotating and non - rotating des ( nominally defined as galaxies with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively ) and investigated whether or not other de properties are correlated with rotation velocity .",
    "we show that rotation velocity is not correlated with a de s position in the fundamental plane , the presence or absence of underlying disks or substructure , absorption - line - strength indices , or local environment .",
    "currently favored formation models do not naturally predict a dichotomy in the internal dynamics of de galaxies .",
    "one possible explanation for the varying amount of rotational support is different mechanisms for the formation of rotating and non - rotating des .",
    "although our observations do not rule out multiple formation mechanisms , they do place very tight constraints on variations in observable properties between the resulting de populations .",
    "in particular , significantly different origins for rotating and non - rotating des would need to result in stellar populations that are indistinguishable between the two de types yet very different from those of more luminous classical ellipticals .",
    "it is equally challenging however to produce the range in rotational properties via a single physical process .    our conclusion that the internal properties and local environments of rotating versus non - rotating can not be distinguished is limited by the size of our de sample ; increasing the number of des , particularly rotating des , with spatially - resolved measurements of internal kinematics is an important step towards further understanding the formation of these galaxies .",
    "it is equally important to refine the predictions and better understand the limitations of currently proposed de formation models .",
    "for example , does the harassment scenario in which des are formed from larger disk galaxies via gravitational interactions produce the observed range of rotational support , and , in particular , can it account for the large fraction of des without significant rotation ? to what extent do these interactions disrupt the disk of a progenitor galaxy and at what level is substructure predicted in des ?",
    "similar questions should be asked of any proposed de formation model . because des are so numerous in nearby galaxy clusters",
    ", constraining the formation and evolution of these objects is an important step towards assembling a global picture of galaxy evolution in these regions .",
