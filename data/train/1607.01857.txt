    "due to the unique properties of the neutrons , their use as an experimental probe for studying atomic ( or molecular ) vibrations and interactions is a rather well - established technique which has contributed to many advances in various scientific areas such as condensed matter physics and chemical sciences @xcite .",
    "notable recent examples have revealed the existence of a magnetic resonance peak in iron - based superconductors @xcite , clarified the connection between bose - einstein condensation and superfluidity in the bosonic liquid @xmath7he @xcite , unravelled the existence of a roton - like signature in non - bosonic liquid @xmath16he @xcite , found a non - gaussian proton momentum distribution in confined water @xcite , .. the momentum @xmath17 and energy @xmath3 landscape that can be probed by neutrons is rather broad , and generally not accessible by a single instrument and multiple reconfigurations of the same instrument @xciteare often necessary .",
    "this is because each neutron instrument is tailored and optimized ( by design and technical limitations ) to only probe a small cross - section of the wider @xmath18 space , making it often necessary to use multiple neutron instruments with overlapping @xmath19 windows and/or other complementary techniques before a particular phenomenon can be fully understood .",
    "one notoriously known limiting factor for reconciling and interpreting neutron scattering data from different instruments is the fact that the energy resolution function of a given instrument depends not only on the instrument parameters but also on the imparted momentum @xmath2 and energy @xmath3 to the sample .",
    "therefore , while qualitative interpretation of the raw ins data is generally possible ( peak positions , dispersive nature of the excitations ) , any rigorous quantitative analysis of ins data ( excitation lifetimes , bec fraction ) requires an accurate knowledge of the resolution function @xmath1 @xcite .    to set the background , we note that at small momentum transfers @xmath2 ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) , inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) is quite effective in examining molecular re - orientation , diffusion processes and low energy excitations . in those cases , the resolution function",
    "is usually obtained by directly measuring the exact same sample at the lowest possible temperatures where dynamical processes become frozen out on the instrument measurement time window , leaving out only the instrument contributions at or close to the elastic region .",
    "this is particularly true for backscattering instruments where the energy resolution width remains largely constant over the accessible @xmath2 range and over a fairly broad dynamics range close to the elastic peak @xcite .",
    "[ fig : roton_basis ] compares the observed elementary excitation ( or roton ) in superfluid @xmath7he at temperature of 1.7 k to its resolution limited response at 300 mk on the basis neutron spectrometer @xcite at the oak ridge national laboratory s spallation neutron source ( sns ) .",
    "the low temperature measurement faithfully reproduces the asymmetric resolution due to the liquid h moderator source . on most indirect geometry neutron instruments such as basis , or direct geometry instruments in low @xmath2 mode such as the dcs @xcite at the nist center for neutron research , it may at times be sufficient to simply measure a purely incoherent standard such as vanadium in lieu of the low temperature measurements to determine @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , no such straightforward practical approach exists when dealing with ins data from direct geometry instruments at high @xmath2 s . at intermediate @xmath2 s ( @xmath22 @xmath21 ) , which is well - suited for studying collective excitation modes such as phonons and magnons , and characteristic excitations such as rotons and molecular crystal fields , there exists few benchmarked software tools that account for resolution contributions in analyzing ins data collected on time - of - flight chopper spectrometers .",
    "the tobyfit software package @xcite which uses a semi - empirical method to approximate the resolution function has been the primary workhorse for analyzing time - of - flight ins data in this regime . on the other end of the @xmath2 spectrum",
    ", the high momentum transfer regime ( @xmath23 @xmath21 ) , which is the subject of this study , the inelastic scattering process of the individual atoms resembles closely the scattering of freely moving particles and the neutron response is characterized by recoil scattering . in these two cases , @xmath1 can either be inferred from measuring calibrated samples for which the scattering function is well known so that it can be numerically deconvoluted from the measurements , or from using ray tracing monte carlo methods with all instrument characteristics as input . in this article",
    ", we present the resolution function of the arcs neutron spectrometer at the spallation neutron source @xcite at the oak ridge national laboratory obtained using each of these two procedures .",
    "the main goal is to properly account for the instrument resolution contributions when analyzing ins data obtained at high @xmath2 s ( i.e. dins ) . using these",
    "differently obtained @xmath1 , we investigate the changes in the resulting average kinetic energy @xmath24 of the atoms in normal liquid @xmath7he , and the fraction of atoms that bose condense ( bec ) in the superfluid phase .",
    "while @xmath24 is directly proportional to the linewidth @xmath11 of the dins signal , the macroscopic number of atoms in the bec state can be inferred from the relative change in intensity in the dins response between the normal and superfluid phases .",
    "our analysis shows consistent @xmath24 results with previous measurements at saturated vapor pressure ( svp ) @xcite and at elevated pressure near the liquid - solid transition line @xcite .",
    "the condensate fraction @xmath13 shows however sensitivity to otherwise marginally different @xmath1 .",

    "the resolution limited asymmetric sharp peak ( blue circles ) at low temperature is used to represent the intrinsic energy resolution function ( hwhm@xmath25 5.8 @xmath26ev ) for studying the temperature dependence of the roton lifetime at @xmath27 k ( red circles ) . ]",
    "the wide angular range chopper spectrometer arcs @xcite is one of four direct geometry neutron instruments located at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) , oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "this means that it uses a monochromatic beam of neutrons whose energy @xmath28 can be set by the experimenter by varying the rotation speed and phase of a spinning fermi chopper @xcite located before the sample position to probe large area of momentum - energy ( @xmath19 ) space of a subject material .",
    "a model view of the arcs instrument layout is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] for more details .",
    "the final energy @xmath29 of the neutrons after scattering from the sample is determined by time - of - flight techniques ( tof ) , allowing the energy transfer @xmath3 to the sample to be calculated , @xmath30 .",
    "using kinematic constraints for a given incident energy @xmath28 , the momentum transfer @xmath2 can be conveniently expressed as a function of the energy transfer @xmath3 , and the scattering angle @xmath31 , the angle between the incident and scattered beam ( often called @xmath32 in diffraction methods ) , yielding , @xmath33 where @xmath34 2.017 mev @xmath35 . on arcs ,",
    "this parametric relation allows large region of @xmath19 to be probed , thanks to the large @xmath31 coverage by the detector arrays , @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : sqe_lhe_exp ] illustrates the large @xmath19 range accessible on arcs with the incident energy @xmath37686 mev we used in our experiment .",
    "this particular two - dimensional ( 2d ) map shows the data collected on bulk liquid @xmath7he under its own vapor pressure ( svp ) ( colored curved strip ) after proper background subtraction .",
    "parts of the inaccessible regions due to kinematic constraints ( parabola cut - off imposed by eq.[eqn : qvsomega ] ) are marked by the sharp edges on the strip at the high @xmath2 and @xmath3 regions .",
    "the solid black line is the ideal free @xmath7he atom recoil line , expressed as @xmath38 .",
    "the background considered here consists of 1 ) the empty al container measured using the same instrumental configuration at 2.5 k and 2 ) an intrinsic weak broad angle - independent ( @xmath39 ) signal centered around 300 mev ( less than 1 - 2% of the overall intensity ) , suggestive of multiple scattering effects .",
    "this broad component was approximated by averaging out the total signal at low angles ( @xmath40 , away from the @xmath7he recoil scattering ) , and extrapolating it uniformly across all angles . below we describe in details the neutron measurements and the mc simulations .      in the high @xmath2-regime",
    "also known as impulse approximation limit , the incoming neutron transfers high energy and momentum to the atoms in the sample . in this event ,",
    "the energy transferred to the sample , @xmath3 , is large compared to the collective excitations energies in the material , with very short scattering time ( atto - seconds ) .",
    "the validity of this approximation in neutron scattering is very well - documented @xcite .",
    "the ia effectively treats the scattering event as single atom billiard ball scattering , in which the momentum and energy conservation rules apply to the neutron and target atom pair . as a result ,",
    "the target atom with mass @xmath41 recoils somewhat independently of its neighbors with an energy @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the recoil speed ) and the observed scattering intensity is well approximated by the incoherent dynamic structure factor @xmath44 . in most liquids",
    ", this is an excellent approximation for q@xmath45 15 @xmath21 .",
    "the scattering function @xmath46 can be expressed in terms of the longitudinal momentum variable , @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is essentially the component of the single particle atomic momentum projected along q and @xmath50 is the longitudinal momentum distribution .",
    "this transformation reduces the separate @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence of the scattering into a single convenient variable @xmath47 and @xmath50 collapses into a @xmath2-independent distribution that is centered around @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , the limits of the ia are not quite achieved experimentally and hence deviations known as final state effects ( fse ) must be taken into considerations when analyzing the data . the fse account for the interactions of the struck @xmath7he atom with its neighbors , as sensed by the neutrons upon scattering off the sample at these high but finite @xmath2 values @xcite . in @xmath7he ,",
    "the fse do not change much with temperature and we use the previously determined fse found at svp @xcite to treat the current dins data .",
    "the fse impose some residual @xmath2 dependence on the observed scattering and so what is measured can be thought of as a convolution between @xmath52 and fse such that @xmath53 .",
    "hence careful analysis of @xmath54 over a sufficiently large range in @xmath2 can yield information on both @xmath50 and fse since j@xmath55 is @xmath2-independent and fse are not . for @xmath7he with @xmath564.002 gram / mol",
    ", we use the factor @xmath571.0443 mev @xmath58 to convert @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , for protonated compounds",
    "( e.g. h@xmath61o ) commonly studied in dins , it is convenient to use the conversion factor @xmath62 mev @xmath35 since @xmath63= 1 gram / mol . as a side note , it is worthwhile noting that while h@xmath61o related compounds are measurable on arcs using 2 - 3 ev incident energy , the h recoil line is significantly broader than the instrument resolution and not limited by resolution effects .",
    "however , because of the relatively smaller mass of hydrogen compared to @xmath7he , the recoil line does nt extend high enough in @xmath2 and the reliable dins analysis tends to be limited to very small @xmath2 range . to study single proton dynamics over a wider high @xmath2-range on neutron chopper instruments such as arcs or the sister instrument sequoia@xcite",
    ", it may be useful to use deuterated compounds ( d ) to shift the proton recoil line to lower energies and access a wider @xmath2 range .    in general ,",

    "<S> inelastic neutron scattering at high momentum transfers ( i.e. @xmath0  ) , commonly known as deep inelastic neutron scattering ( dins ) , provides direct observation of the momentum distribution of light atoms , making it a powerful probe for studying single - particle motions in liquids and solids . the quantitative analysis of dins data requires an accurate knowledge of the instrument resolution function @xmath1 at each momentum @xmath2 and energy transfer @xmath3 , where the label @xmath4 indicates whether the resolution was experimentally observed @xmath5 or simulated @xmath6 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we describe two independent methods for determining the total resolution function @xmath1 of the arcs neutron instrument at the spallation neutron source , oak ridge national laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> the first method uses experimental data from an archetypical system ( liquid @xmath7he ) studied with dins , which are then numerically deconvoluted using its previously determined intrinsic scattering function to yield @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the second approach uses accurate monte carlo simulations of the arcs spectrometer , which account for all instrument contributions , coupled to a representative scattering kernel to reproduce the experimentally observed response @xmath9 . using a delta function as scattering kernel , the simulation yields a resolution function @xmath10 with comparable lineshape and features as @xmath8 , but somewhat narrower due to the ideal nature of the model . using each of these two @xmath1 separately </S>",
    "<S> , we extract characteristic parameters of liquid @xmath7he such as the intrinsic linewidth @xmath11 ( which sets the atomic kinetic energy @xmath12 ) in the normal liquid and the bose - einstein condensate parameter @xmath13 in the superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted @xmath11 values agree well with previous measurements at saturated vapor pressure ( svp ) as well as at elevated pressure ( 24 bars ) within experimental precision , independently of which @xmath14 is used to analyze the data . </S>",
    "<S> the actual observed @xmath13 values at each @xmath2 vary little with the model @xmath15 , and the effective @xmath2-averaged @xmath13 values are consistent with each other , and with previously reported values .    </S>",
