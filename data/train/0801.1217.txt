    "blazars represent a small subset of the most enigmatic class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , exhibiting strong variability at all wavelengths of the whole electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum , strong polarization from radio to optical wavelengths , and usually core dominated radio structures .",
    "the radiation of blazars at all wavelengths is predominantly nonthermal .",
    "this class includes bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "bl lacs show largely featureless optical continuum . in a unified model of the radio - loud agn based on the angle between the line of sight and the emitted jet from the source , blazars jet",
    "make angle of @xmath2 10@xmath3 from the line of sight ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the radiation emitted by the plasma , with bulk relativistic motion in the jet oriented at small viewing angles , is affected by relativistic beaming , which in turn implies a shortening of time scales by a factor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the doppler factor .    from observations of blazars",
    ", it is known that they vary on the diverse time scales .",
    "variability time scales of blazars can be broadly divided into 3 classes viz .",
    "intra - day variability ( idv ) or micro - variability , short term outbursts and long term trends .",
    "significant variations in flux of a few tenths of magnitude over the course of a day or less is often known as idv ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "short term outburst and long term trends can have time scales range from few weeks to several months and several months to years , respectively .",
    "in last about two decades , variability of blazars in radio to optical bands on diverse time scales have been reported in a large number of papers ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "1989 ; courvoisier , et al . 1995 ; heidt & wagner 1996 ; takalo et al . 1996 ; sillanp@xmath6 et al .",

    "2002a ; gupta et al .",
    "2004 ; ciprini et al . 2003 , 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "we selected a sample of a dozen blazars which are prominent candidates for simultaneous multi - wavelength observing campaigns in their outburst phase .",
    "the motivation of the present work was to observe these blazars in search for idv , short term variability and also find out if there is any one being in the outburst state .",
    "blazar emission mechanism in the outburst state and detected idv is strongly supported by the jet based models of radio - loud agn . in general , blazar emission in the outburst state is nonthermal doppler boosted emission from jets ( blandford & rees 1978 ; marscher & gear 1985 ; marscher et al .",
    "1992 , hughes et al .",
    "there are other models of agn that can explain the idv in any type of agn are optical flares , disturbances or hot spots on the accretion disk surrounding the black hole of the agn ( mangalam & wiita 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "models based on the instabilities on accretion disc are mainly supported blazars idv when the blazar is in the low - state . when a blazar is in the low - state , any contribution from the jets if at all present , is very weak .",
    "recently , it is noticed that , in the low luminosity agn , accretion disk is radiatively inefficient ( chiaberge et al .",
    "2006 ; capetti et al . 2007 ) .",
    "so , there will be an alternative way to explain the idv in the low - state of blazars , in which a weak jet emission will be responsible for the idv . with this motivation we recently carried out optical photometric observations of the nine blazars : s2 0109@xmath1224 , ao 0235@xmath1164 , s5 0716@xmath1714 , pks 0735@xmath1178 , oj 287 , on 231 , 3c 279 and 1es 2344@xmath1514 in r passband and 3c 454.3 in v and r passbands .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : section 2 describes observations and data analysis method , in section 3 we mentioned our results , discussion and conclusion of the present work is reported in section 4 .",
    "the photometric observations of the blazars s2 0109@xmath1224 , ao 0235@xmath1164 , s5 0716@xmath1714 , pks 0735@xmath1178 , oj 287 , on 231 , 3c 279 and 1es 2344@xmath1514 in johnson r passband and 3c 454.3 in johnson v and r passbands were carried out using the ccd detector ( 1024 pixels @xmath7 1024 pixels ) mounted at f/13.3 cassegrain focus of the 1.02 meter rc ( ritchey chertien ) optical telescope at yunnan observatory , kunming , china .",
    "these blazars were observed during october 27 , 2006 to march 20 , 2007 in 13 observing nights .",

    "the typical seeing was @xmath2 1.8 arcsec ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 arcsec .",
    "several bias frames were taken intermittently in each observing night and twilight sky flats were taken in v and r passbands .",
    "detail photometric observation log is given in the table 1 .",
    "for each observing night we generated a master bias by taking median of all bias frames in the night .",
    "master bias frame is subtracted from all the target image frames and flat field image frames of the night .",
    "then master v and r passband flat field image frames were generated for the night by taking median of all flat field images in v and r passband respectively .",
    "image processing or pre processing ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding and cosmic rays removal ) were done using standard routines in iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) software .",
    "photometric reduction or processing of the data were performed by aperture photometric technique using daophot ii ( dominian astronomical observatory photometry ) software ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out with concentric apertures of radii 8 , 11 , 15 and 20 pixels .",
    "the data reduced with different aperture radii were found to be in good agreement .",
    "however , it was noticed that the best signal to noise ratio was obtained with the aperture radius of 15 pixels ( 5.7 arcsec slightly more than 3 @xmath7 of typical fwhm ) .    in our observations of all nine blazars ,",
    "local standard stars were also always present in the observed image frames .",
    "we always observed three or more local standard stars in our every target blazar field .",
    "the magnitude of standard stars which we observed in the field of our observed blazars are given in table 2 .",
    "these standard stars were used to check the non variable characteristic of standard stars and then transformed the instrumental magnitude of the blazars to the standard magnitude .",
    "finally we selected two standard stars from each blazar field and plotted their differential instrumental magnitude light curve by adding arbitrary offset for clarity in the plot with the light curves of blazars ( calibrated magnitude ) .",
    "photometric data of our blazars observations are provided in table 4224 , s5 0716@xmath1714 , pks 0735@xmath1178 , on 231 and 1es 2344@xmath1514 .",

    "please contact the webt president massimo villata ( villata@oata.inaf.it ) ] .",
    "using aperture photometry of blazar and few standard stars in the blazar field , we determined the differential instrumental magnitude of blazar @xmath0 standard star a , blazar @xmath0 standard star b and standard star a @xmath0 standard star b. finally we selected star a or b to do calibration of the blazar data .",
