    "a free resolution of an ideal @xmath3 $ ] is a long exact sequence of free modules that represents the relations between the generators of that ideal .",
    "if @xmath0 is generated by monomials it is always possible to find a simplicial complex whose simplicial chain complex determines a free resolution of the @xmath2 ( e.g. the taylor complex , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "a natural question is which monomial ideals do have such minimal simplicial resolutions ?    in this paper we consider squarefree monomial ideals of projective dimension 1 .",
    "the restriction to squarefree monomial ideals can be made without loss of generality since the polarization , @xmath4 , of @xmath0 is a squarefree monomial idea for any monomial ideal @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , peeva and velasco @xcite show that the minimal free resolution of both @xmath2 and the minimal free resolution of @xmath5 are homogenizations of the same frame .",
    "in particular , the minimal free resolution of @xmath2 is supported on a simplicial complex if and only if @xmath5 is supported on the same simplicial complex .",
    "we show that if @xmath0 is a squarefree monomial ideal of projective dimension 1 , then we can give a complete combinatorial characterization of both @xmath0 and the minimal free resolution of @xmath2 .",
    "our treatment of of these ideals and their resolutions allow us to prove the following theorem , in which we let @xmath6 denote the alexander dual of the stanley - reisner complex of @xmath0 .",

    "the equivalence of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) was established by herzog , hibi , and zheng @xcite by applying the hilbert - burch theorem ; it is a characterization of the minimal free resolution of @xmath9 , when @xmath10 is a local ring ( in our case a graded local ring ) and @xmath11 ( i.e. @xmath12 ) , by the determinants of minors of the differential .",
    "the approach taken in this paper is to first establish the equivalence of ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) for a general monomial ideal @xmath0 , and then show that when @xmath0 is additionally squarefree ( 2 ) holds if and only if ( 3 ) holds as well .",

    "one of the properties of simplicial trees that we will make particular use of is that whenever @xmath14 is a simplicial tree we can always order the facets @xmath45 of @xmath14 so that @xmath46 is a leaf of the induced subcollection @xmath47 .",
