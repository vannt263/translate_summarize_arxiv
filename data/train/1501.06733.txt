    "the kondo effect is one of the most well - known strong coupling problems in condensed matter physics , ever since kondo s explanation of conductance minimum in some metals with magnetic impurities @xcite . in a system showing the kondo effect , a localized magnetic - impurity state is decoupled from dynamics of conduction electrons at high temperatures , while at low temperatures , they become strongly coupled and the local moment is screened completely by conduction electrons . in the low - temperature phase ,",
    "the magnetic moment and conduction electrons form a many - body singlet state , referred to as a local fermi - liquid phase @xcite .",
    "this strongly coupled dynamics has been solved by some exact methods such as numerical renormalization group @xcite and bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "they are non - perturbative in nature , which means that these theoretical frameworks need not assume any fixed points as a starting point",
    ". it would be valuable to develop a formalism which can describe the magnetic - impurity dynamics over the whole temperature range ( from the decoupled local moment state as a gaussian uv ( ultraviolet ) fixed point to the local fermi liquid state as an ir ( infrared ) strong coupling fixed point ) and identify relevant quantum corrections responsible for the change from the uv to ir fixed points .",
    "there is a sincere theory that describes the evolution of impurity dynamics from the local moment state to the local fermi - liquid phase , referred to as self - consistent ctma ( conserving t - matrix approximation ) theory , which is based on the slave - boson representation for the magnetic impurity @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "renormalizations of interaction vertices are introduced into the slave - boson nca ( non - crossing approximation ) theory .",
    "such vertex corrections turn a weak coupling  local \" non - fermi liquid fixed point of the slave - boson nca theory into the strong coupling local fermi - liquid state of the slave - boson ctma theory . on the other hand , the schwinger - boson based self - consistent theory has been demonstrated to make the local fermi - liquid fixed point accessible from the local moment state within the nca framework @xcite , regarded to be much simpler than the slave - boson ctma framework .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the kondo problem and confirm the existence of the perturbatively accessible strong coupling fixed point , starting from the decoupled local moment state .",
    "resorting to the schwinger - boson representation for the description of a localized magnetic - impurity state , we develop an rg - improved ( renormalization group ) perturbation theory for the kondo effect . evaluating the specific heat and spin susceptibility of the local magnetic moment ,",
    "we show that the schwinger - boson based rg - improved perturbation theory covers the whole temperature range from the decoupled local moment state to the local fermi - liquid state through the crossover temperature regime .",

    "the original normal electron basis has been utilized . in the single - impurity kondo problem , we perform essentially the same work , where the schwinger - boson representation is introduced to reconstruct the basis set for the magnetic impurity state and the renormalization group analysis is resorted to instead of the bethe - salpeter equation , both of which should be regarded to be identical at low energies .    the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ rg eq ] we perform the perturbative renormalization group analysis to derive the renormalized kondo interaction vertex as a function of frequency . then , using the frequency dependent coupling , we construct the rg - improved perturbation theory in sec .",

    "both quantities remain the same for either fermion or boson representation of the localized spin . on the other hand ,",
    "the finiteness of the spinon chemical potential is allowed only when the statistics of spinons follows that of bosons .",
    "the spinon chemical potential vanishes at zero temperature for the slave - boson representation of the localized spin , resulting in the local non - fermi liquid fixed point instead of the local fermi - liquid one .",
    "the temperature scale for the local fermi - liquid state is given by @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is determined by the pole of the renormalized kondo interaction vertex and @xmath129 is consistent with the temperature at which the spinon chemical potential starts to become a constant .",
    "the finite spinon chemical potential allows three temperature regimes , corresponding to the decoupled local moment state above @xmath144 , a strongly fluctuating kondo regime in @xmath145 , and the local fermi - liquid state below @xmath129 . both the specific heat coefficient and spin susceptibility of the magnetic impurity confirm the existence of three temperature ranges .",
    "such thermodynamic quantities look essentially similar to those of the schwinger - boson based nca self - consistent theory @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the slave - boson based rg - improved perturbation theory fails to reproduce such three regimes as the slave - boson based nca self - consistent theory , the origin of which is that the spinon chemical potential vanishes identically at zero temperature as discussed above . combined with the slave - boson based ctma self - consistent theory , we speculate that vertex corrections of the ctma theory turn the statistic of spinons from fermions to bosons , giving rise to the local fermi - liquid state .    not only the exactly screened kondo effect but also the over - screened kondo effect can be described within the rg - improved schwinger - boson perturbation theory . keeping the second cubic term in the rg equation ( [ eq : rge ] )",
    ", we find a frequency - dependent kondo coupling function .",
    "resorting to this kondo vertex , we can describe the non - fermi liquid fixed point @xcite within the rg - improved perturbation framework . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear how to reach the singular fermi - liquid fixed point , which corresponds to the under - screened case @xcite , where the impurity spin is partially screened through the strong - coupling kondo vertex and the residual magnetic moment becomes coupled to conduction electrons ferromagnetically .",
    "if we focus on the low - temperature regime , we may resort to an rg equation for the ferromagnetic kondo vertex , allowing us to describe the singular fermi - liquid state successfully within our perturbation theory . on the other hand , in order to understand the crossover from the local moment state to the singular fermi - liquid state , we may divide each regime for the rg analysis since the rg equation at high temperatures would differ from that at low temperatures .",
    "it is not fully clarified yet the role of the channel number of conduction electrons in the present  perturbation \" theory , more concretely , how the channel number affects the rg analysis @xcite .",
    "we would like to claim that the present study implies an interesting and important message for bad metals near mott quantum criticality , where local magnetic moments may emerge at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "in addition , we believe that the schwinger - boson based rg - improved perturbation theory for the kondo effect sheds some light on the nature of non - fermi liquid physics near heavy - fermion quantum criticality , involved with the mechanism how localized magnetic moments are screened to form a landau s fermi - liquid state of heavy electrons @xcite .",
