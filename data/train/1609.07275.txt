    "recently hybrid phase transitions ( hpts ) containing natures of both first - order and second - order phase transitions have drawn much attention  @xcite .",
    "the order parameter changes discontinuously at a transition point and exhibits a critical behavior in the vicinity of the transition point , but some physical quantities such as the susceptibility and correlation length diverge at a transition point .",
    "however , a thorough study is yet to be conducted to determine if the conventional scaling relations among the critical exponents hold for the critical behavior of hpts as they do for second - order phase transitions . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we studied the scaling relations in the hpt of the cascading failure ( cf ) model on multiplex networks  @xcite . unlike ordinary percolation",
    ", the hpt exhibits two different critical behaviors : divergences of the fluctuations of the order parameter and mean avalanche size of finite avalanches at a transition point in different ways .",
    "thus , two sets of critical exponents are required , those associated with the order parameter and those with finite avalanches .",
    "we found that conventional scaling relations hold only among the critical exponents associated with the order parameter and do partially for finite avalanches .",
    "our studies were helpful in understanding the critical behavior and thus establishing a theoretical framework for the hybrid percolation transition in pruning processes .    in this paper , we extend our previous study for the cf model to @xmath0-core percolation on single - layered erds - rnyi ( er ) networks .",
    "the critical behavior of @xmath0-core percolation is analytically accessible more easily than that of the cf model .",
    "thus , some of the critical exponents have been obtained analytically using the local tree approximation  @xcite . yet , a complete set of critical exponents for @xmath0-core percolation , particularly those associated with hyperscaling relations have not been determined even numerically .",
    "thus , the aim of this paper is to determine all critical exponent values of @xmath0-core percolation .",
    "we find that even though the detailed dynamics of the cf model on multiplex networks and @xmath0-core percolation are different , the critical behaviors of each system share some universal features . for instance , the hyperscaling relations hold within the critical exponents associated with the order parameter , and there exists a relation between the exponents of the order parameter and the mean size of finite avalanches .",
    "most critical exponents are the same .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce @xmath0-core percolation on er random networks and show the critical behavior of hybrid phase transition that the @xmath0-core percolation exhibits . moreover , we introduce two sets of exponents representing the critical behaviors . in section iii , we present numerical results for the critical exponents associated with the order parameter and finite avalanches , respectively .",
    "the comparison between the critical exponents for @xmath0-core percolation and the cf model is presented in section iv .",
    "@xmath0-core of a network is a subgraph in which the degree of each node is at least @xmath0 . to obtain a @xmath0-core subgraph , once an er network of size @xmath1 with mean",
    "degree @xmath2 is generated , all nodes with degree less than @xmath0 are deleted .",
    "this deletion may decrease the degrees of the remaining nodes .",
    "if the degrees of some nodes become less than @xmath0 , then those nodes are deleted as well .",
    "this pruning process is repeated until no more node with degree less than @xmath0 remain in the system .",
    "the fraction of nodes remaining in the largest @xmath0-core subgraph is defined as the order parameter @xmath3 and the mean degree @xmath2 is as the control parameter .",
    "the order parameter @xmath3 is large , specifically of @xmath4 for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a transition point , and decreases continuously with decreasing @xmath2 . as @xmath2 approaches @xmath6 , the deletion of a node from an er network can lead to the collapse of the giant @xmath0-core subgraph .",
    "thus , the order parameter is written as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants and @xmath10 is the critical exponent of the order parameter . moreover ,",
    "the exponent @xmath11 is used to define the fluctuations of the order parameter ; that is @xmath12 .",
    "the exponent @xmath13 is used to define the finite size scaling behavior of the order parameter as @xmath14 at @xmath15 . here",
    "the subscript @xmath3 of the exponents indicates that the exponents are associated with the order parameter @xmath3 .",
    "next , we remove a randomly selected node from a @xmath0-core subgraph",
    ". this removal may lead to another successive deletion of nodes .",
    "the avalanche size is defined as the number of removed nodes in such successive pruning processes and the duration time of the avalanche is the number of pruning steps .",
    "these definitions are consistent with those defined in refs .",
    "@xcite for the cf model . in the vicinity of @xmath6",
    ", an avalanche can lead to the entire collapse of a @xmath0-core subgraph .",
    "we call such an avalanche an infinite avalanche . on the other hand , if the @xmath0-core still remains after an avalanche , we call it a finite avalanche . the size distribution of finite avalanches follows the power law @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes avalanche size and @xmath18 is a scaling function . here",
    "@xmath19 is the characteristic size of avalanches , which behaves according to @xmath20 as @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath6 in finite systems .",
    "the exponent @xmath23 is associated with the mean avalanche size as @xmath24 . here",
    "the subscript @xmath25 indicates that the exponents are associated with avalanches .    in short , we defined two sets of exponents @xmath26 and @xmath27 associated with the order parameter and finite avalanches , respectively .",
    "these are the same sets already defined in ref  @xcite for the cf model .",

    "even if a deleted node has degree larger than @xmath0 , if it is connected to one or more nodes belonging to more than one corona cluster , then one of the corona cluster is removed in avalanche processes",
    ". however , numerically , in most cases only nodes belonging to one corona cluster are removed and the number of removed nodes with degree larger than @xmath0 are few when the avalanche size is finite .",
    "thus the statistical feature of finite avalanche sizes and the number of nodes deleted from corona clusters are effectively consistent to each other .",
