    "the flow parameters of jets in extragalactic radio sources have hitherto proven difficult to determine because of the absence of unambiguous diagnostics .",
    "most progress has been made in the estimation of velocities , particularly where these are thought to be relativistic .",
    "the idea that jets in low - luminosity , i.e.  fri @xcite , radio galaxies have relativistic speeds rests on five main arguments :    1 .",

    "observations of brightness and width asymmetries in fri jets which decrease with distance from the nucleus and are correlated with fractional core flux , implying that they decelerate and are faster on - axis than at their edges @xcite .",
    "this paper reports a detailed study of the applicability of decelerating relativistic jet models to the well - resolved kiloparsec - scale structures in the nearby fri radio galaxy 3c31 .",
    "our intention is to deconvolve the emission mechanism ( synchrotron radiation from a magnetized relativistic flow ) from the radio data , without embodying specific preconceptions about the poorly known internal physics .",
    "we construct sophisticated three - dimensional models of the effects of relativistic aberration on the appearance of intrinsically symmetric magnetized jets and we fit these models to the observed total and polarized intensity distributions in 3c31 . the aim is to derive robust estimates of the velocity field , the emissivity ( combining relativistic particle density and magnetic field strength ) and the three - dimensional ordering of the magnetic field ( purely geometrical factors independent of its strength ) . we regard this as a necessary first step : realistic physical models capable of being compared with observations are not yet available .",
    "we are able to reproduce many of the observed features of the jets and we conclude that our models now provide a way to obtain key constraints on the intrinsic properties of extragalactic radio jets .",
    "section  [ observations ] describes new vla imaging of the jets in 3c31 that provides a high - quality data set suitable for detailed fitting by our models .",
    "section  [ model - theory ] first reviews the principles underlying the relativistic jet models , and then goes on to describe how we adjust their parameters to fit the radio intensity and polarization data .",
    "section  [ results ] critically discusses the model fits and reviews the main features of the inferred jet velocity field , magnetic structure and emissivity distribution .",
    "section  [ discussion ] discusses more general implications , including : specific problems associated with reproducing the properties of the jets in the region closest to the galactic nucleus ; the reasons for the sudden onset of deceleration ; evidence for interaction between the jet and the surrounding medium and the applicability of adiabatic models .",
    "section  [ angles ] illustrates how the jets in 3c31 should appear if orientated at other angles to the line of sight and outlines the applicability of the model to other fri sources , including those orientated at a small angle to the line of sight .",
    "section  [ summary ] summarizes our conclusions regarding the kinematics , emissivity and field structure of the three distinct regions of the jet and their implications for future work .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a hubble constant @xmath3 = 70 km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 .",
    "our key assumption is that the bases of the two jets are intrinsically identical , antiparallel , axisymmetric stationary flows , and that the apparent differences between them result entirely from relativistic aberration .",
    "this is an approximation in two important respects : we ignore small - scale structure in the jets , and we assume that any intrinsic or environmental asymmetries ( clearly dominant on the largest scales in many objects ) are small compared with relativistic effects close to the nucleus . for any individual source , it is difficult to be sure that this is the case , particularly if the asymmetry persists on all scales .",
    "there are also a few sources ( e.g.  0755 + 379 ; @xcite ) in which the counter - jet appears much wider than the main jet , an effect which can not be produced by relativistic beaming .",
    "we argue that these cases are rare @xcite and easy to recognize .",
    "if the jet / counter - jet ratio decreases with distance from the nucleus , approaching unity on large scales , then relativistic effects probably dominate , as most plausible intrinsic or environmental mechanisms would generate asymmetries which stay roughly constant or even increase with distance .",
    "a statistical study of a complete sample of fri sources with jets selected from the b2 sample @xcite suggests that the median asymptotic jet / counter - jet ratio on large scales @xmath01.1 for the weaker sources , so the assumption of intrinsic symmetry for the jets is generally reasonable .",
    "we ensure that this assumption is self - consistent by choosing an object whose jets are straight , with similar outer isophotes on both sides of the nucleus .",
    "we also require that the jets are bright , allowing imaging with high signal - to - noise ratio in total intensity and linear polarization , and that any effects of faraday rotation can be accurately corrected .",
    "this led us to the choice of 3c31 as the first source to model .",
    "3c31 is an fri radio galaxy that has long been known ( e.g.@xcite ) to have a resolved bright jet and counter - jet with a strong initial brightness asymmetry , also present on parsec scales @xcite , a high degree of linear polarization at centimetre wavelengths @xcite and a significant depolarization asymmetry @xcite .",
    "it is identified with the dusty elliptical galaxy ngc383 @xcite that is the brightest member of a rich group of galaxies @xcite with an extensive hot intra - group medium @xcite .",
    "we adopt a redshift of 0.0169 for the galaxy ( the mean of values from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , so the projected linear scale of the images is 0.34kpc / arcsec .",
    "the observations ( table  [ journal ] ) were made using all four configurations of the vla at centre frequencies of 8.46 or 8.44ghz and a bandwidth of 100mhz ( the slight difference in frequencies between configurations has no measurable effect ) .",
    "they were reduced in the aips software package using standard self - calibration and imaging methods , with one major exception , viz .  an iterative technique used to combine data from the different vla configurations when the compact core had varied significantly between observations .",
    "in order to make the best possible images , we needed to adjust for these changes in the compact core , as well as for slight inconsistencies in the amplitude calibration of the four observing runs .",
    "we therefore adopted the following procedure :    1 .",
    "image and clean the data from the widest ( a ) configuration , ensuring that the compact core is centred on a map pixel .",
    "self - calibrate , initially adjusting only the phases , then the amplitudes , until the best image is obtained .",
    "3 .   use the clean components from this image as a model for phase - only self - calibration of the next widest ( b ) configuration .",
    "image both datasets _ at the same resolution _ in order to measure the flux density of the core .",
    "adjust the _ ( u , v ) _",
    "data for the larger configuration by adding or subtracting the appropriate point component to equalize the core flux densities .",
    "concatenate the two _",
    "( u , v ) _ datasets , image , clean and self - calibrate phases and amplitudes as in steps ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "split the datasets apart again and check that the core flux densities are consistent . if not , repeat steps ( v ) and ( vi ) .",
    "add further vla configurations using steps ( iii ) to ( vii ) .",
    "two sets of images in stokes @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 were made from the combined four - configuration data set , one with full resolution ( gaussian fwhm 0.25arcsec ) and the other tapered to give a fwhm of 0.75arcsec ( table  [ images ] ) .",
    "both the maximum entropy and clean algorithms were used to compute deconvolved @xmath5 images .",
    "the compact core was subtracted from the data before maximum entropy deconvolution , and added in again afterwards .",
    "all images were restored with the same truncated gaussian beam .",
    "the result of differencing the maximum entropy and clean @xmath5 images was a high - frequency , quasi - sinusoidal ripple of near zero mean whose amplitude increased with surface brightness .",
    "this artefact clearly originated in the clean image and such ripples are indeed known to be characteristic of instabilities in the clean algorithm @xcite .",
    "there was no evidence for any differences between the two images on larger scales .",
    "we therefore use only the maximum - entropy @xmath5 images in what follows .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 images were cleaned . a first - order correction for ricean bias @xcite",
    "was made when deriving images of polarized intensity .",
    "apparent magnetic field directions were derived from images of @xmath6 and @xmath7 corrected for faraday rotation using results from a six - frequency analysis of the polarimetry of this region at a resolution of 1.5arcsec fwhm to be published elsewhere .",
    "the maximum correction is @xmath09@xmath1 and faraday depolarization is negligible .",
    "the resulting images are almost noise - limited ( table  [ images ] ) , and the excellent _ ( u , v ) _ coverage and signal - to - noise ratio allow a good representation of jet structures on a wide range of scales .",

    "cm    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    in this sub - section , all of the plots represent a plane containing the jet axis ( not projected on the sky ) and distances are given in linear units .",
    "the angle to the line of sight is one of the few parameters that affects the total and linearly - polarized emission on all scales , and is therefore particularly well constrained .",
    "the best value for both gaussian and ssl models is @xmath8 , with uncertainties of a few degrees .",
    "the inferred velocity field is shown as contour plots in fig .",
    "[ vel - cont ] and as longitudinal profiles in fig .",
    "[ vel - prof ] .",
    "the on - axis velocity of the inner jet is poorly constrained , although extremely low values ( @xmath9 ) are ruled out .",
    "the best fits show an abrupt decrease in velocity across the inner boundary ( fig  [ vel - prof ] ; see section  [ inner - probs ] for a more detailed discussion ) , but continuity can not be entirely ruled out . further out , the velocity field is much better constrained ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , for the flaring and outer regions ) and both models agree almost exactly .",
    "the on - axis velocity remains roughly constant ( @xmath12 ) between 1 and 2.5kpc and then drops abruptly to @xmath13 at the outer boundary .",
    "quantitatively , the exponent @xmath14 in the velocity law for the flaring region ( table  [ long - funcs ] ) is required to be @xmath15 .",
    "thereafter , @xmath16 declines smoothly to @xmath00.22 at 12kpc .    the transverse velocity profile is hardly constrained at all in the inner region .",
    "the best fits in the flaring and outer regions require an edge velocity close to 0.7 of the central value ( figs  [ vel - cont ] and [ vel - prof ] ) , independent of distance from the nucleus .",
    "the error analysis shows , however , that we can not exclude a flat - topped profile at the inner boundary , so some evolution of the profile along the jet could occur .",
    "very low velocities at the edge of the jet are not consistent with the observed sidedness ratios in these regions .      the spatial variation of @xmath17 ( proportional to the rest - frame emissivity ) is shown as a grey - scale image in fig .",
    "[ em - grey ] and as longitudinal profiles in figs  [ em - long ] .",
    "the emissivity is again poorly constrained in the inner region , and we can only exclude very steep decreases with distance . for the shear layer ,",
    "the dependence of emissivity on distance is very different for the flaring ( @xmath18 ) and outer ( @xmath19 ) regions .",
    "the relative contribution from the spine is small , so its emissivity could vary either as a single power - law or in a manner closer to that of the shear layer .",
    "the fractional emissivity at the edge of the shear layer is consistent with a constant value of @xmath00.2 in the flaring and outer regions , although a much wider range ( including zero ) is allowed at the inner boundary .",
    "there is strong evidence for a discontinuity in emissivity at the inner boundary for the shear layer .",
    "very little polarized flux is either predicted or observed to come from the inner region , and no polarized emission is detected from the inner counter - jet . for this reason ,",
    "the field ratios are essentially unconstrained there ( table  [ params ] ) .",
    "the toroidal field component is the largest over most of the flaring and outer regions , increasing from @xmath00.6 to @xmath00.9 of the total between the inner boundary and the end of the modelled region ( fig .",
    "[ bcomp - grey ] ) .",
    "the longitudinal component , conversely , decreases from @xmath00.7 to @xmath00.4 over the same distance .",
    "we found no evidence for any variation of the longitudinal / toroidal field ratio across the shear layer .",
    "the component ratios for the spine are not well determined ( table  [ params ] ) and could quite plausibly be identical to those for the shear layer .",
    "close to the edge of the jet in the flaring region , the radial component becomes appreciable , reaching a maximum of @xmath00.6 at the edge on the outer boundary ( marked by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ bcomp - grey ] ) .",
    "thereafter , it decreases rapidly with distance along the jet , becoming negligible by 9.5kpc from the nucleus in the ssl model .",
    "the radial component , unlike the other two , increases with radius ( fig .",
    "[ bcomp - grey ] ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this variation is required in order to achieve even a qualitative fit to the observed polarization in the flaring region .",
    "our estimates of the angle to the line of sight and the jet velocity in the inner region are entirely consistent with those of @xcite for the jets on parsec scales . for our preferred value of @xmath20 ,",
    "their velocity range is @xmath21 , consistent with our central velocity for the inner region ( @xmath22 ) , but also allowing significant deceleration from parsec to kiloparsec scales .",
    "the inner region poses a problem for any decelerating - jet model , in which the jet - to - counterjet intensity ratio ( sidedness ) must decrease with distance from the nucleus .",
    "we would expect the sidedness ratio to have a maximum in the inner region , in which case the counter - jet would be invisible .",
    "in fact , the inner region clearly has a _ lower _ sidedness , on average , than that in the flaring region .",
    "the brightness distribution is dominated by a few knots , so one possibility is that we are being fooled by stochastic variations .",
    "alternatively , there could be a small amount of relatively slow - moving material in the shear layer , surrounding a fast spine .",
    "if a very slow component also exists further out , it can not have a noticeable effect on the brightness distribution : the fact that the sidedness ratio at the edges of the jet in the flaring region differs significantly from unity requires that the emissivity of any very slow component becomes insignificant on large scales .",
    "this component therefore has a negligible effect on the fits beyond the inner jet , and its properties are constrained only by the intensity fits in the inner region .",
    "the faster component of the flow that dominates the outer jets is relatively faint in the inner region ( because its doppler factor and intrinsic emissivity are both lower than on larger scales ) , so the modelling of the inner region is almost decoupled from that of the rest of the jets in the spine / shear - layer fits .    in the best fit ssl model ,",
    "the slow component has been introduced by assigning a velocity of 0.06@xmath2 to the shear layer while the spine has a velocity of 0.87@xmath2 , i.e.  we have allowed the slow component in the inner region to substitute for the faster - moving shear layer component that is required to explain the flaring region via an unphysical jump condition at the boundary .",
    "we emphasize that higher resolution imaging of the inner jets is needed to obtain firmer constraints on the transverse velocity distribution in this region , and to explore how this distribution evolves as the jet enters the flaring region .",
    "our best guess at the geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ inner - sketch ] .",
    "if this picture is correct , there must still be an increase in emissivity at the flaring point , but the values of @xmath23 quoted in table  [ params ] will be inaccurate . finally , we note that an additional component with @xmath16 significantly higher than 0.9 would be severely doppler - dimmed even in the approaching jet , and therefore very difficult to detect .",
    "we have shown that the onset of deceleration is marked by a large increase in rest - frame emissivity and a major change in the jet collimation .",
    "it is not merely that the jet becomes gradually brighter as it decelerates and doppler suppression is reduced : there is also a discontinuity at the inner boundary .",
    "one possibility is that the jet is supersonic , over - pressured and expanding freely in the inner region . in that case",
    ", the internal pressure would fall until it drops below that of the external medium , at which point a reconfinement shock forms @xcite .",
    "the reconfinement shock is followed by a second shock at which the jet becomes _ overpressured _ with respect to the external medium and it this feature which is most plausibly identified with the flaring point . for a relativistic jet",
    ", @xcite shows that the shock forms at a distance @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy flux through the jet and @xmath26pa @xcite is the external pressure",
    ". this would be consistent with the observed inner boundary distance of 1.1kpc for an energy flux of @xmath27w , somewhat higher than that the value of @xmath28w estimated by @xcite from a conservation - law analysis .",
    "we see no evidence for any simple shock structure at the inner boundary , although the emission there is not completely resolved and there are obvious ( non - axisymmetric ) knots at the beginning of the flaring region .",
    "if the inner region is in free expansion , we can estimate the initial mach number of the flow from the opening angle : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the generalized mach number defined by @xcite , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the internal sound speed , and @xmath33 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath34 corresponds to @xmath35 and hence to @xmath36 if the inner jet has the sound speed @xmath37 of an ultra - relativistic gas .",
    "this initial velocity is considerably faster than we have inferred for the inner region but , as mentioned in section  [ inner - probs ] , we can not exclude the presence of such higher - velocity material there .",
    "a second possibility which has frequently been discussed in the literature is that the flaring point marks the onset of turbulence , or the position at which kelvin - helmholtz instabilities become non - linear ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we will show elsewhere @xcite that conservation - law analysis favours the hypothesis that the flaring point is associated with a stationary shock , primarily because it suggests that the jet is over - pressured at the beginning of the flaring region .",
    "this does not , of course , exclude the subsequent development of entrainment ( and presumably turbulence ) , as we now discuss .",
    "it is generally accepted that jets in fri radio galaxies decelerate by picking up matter , but it is by no means clear whether the principal source of additional material is mass loss from stars @xcite or entrainment across the jet boundary @xcite : both are expected to be important .",
    "our models require significant transverse velocity gradients , in the sense that the edge of the jet is travelling about 30% more slowly than the centre .",
    "these gradients are prima facie evidence for interaction between the flow and the external medium .",
    "there is no reason why mass input from stars should generate such gradients @xcite , although a pre - existing gradient might be preserved as a jet becomes mass - loaded .",
    "the _ form _ of the transverse velocity profile in our best - fitting models varies surprisingly little as the jet decelerates , but the error analysis of section  [ tolerances ] shows that the situation might be more complicated : a top - hat velocity profile at the inner boundary is consistent with the data , so the profile could still evolve significantly along the jet .",
    "the presence of large quantities of very slow material at the edges of the flaring and outer regions is firmly excluded , however ( table  [ params ] ) .",
    "a second piece of evidence favouring deceleration by interaction with the external medium is the complex field structure in the flaring region , where we were forced to introduce a significant radial component , increasing towards the edge of the jet , in order to explain the low degree of linear polarization .",
    "this radial field component would not be expected from simple passive evolution of a mixture of longitudinal and toroidal field in the smooth velocity field we assume .",
    "the most natural way to generate such a radial field component is for the flow to have a disordered , turbulent character towards the jet edges such as might result from large - scale eddies .",
    "this is precisely the situation expected at the edge of the jet in the initial `` ingestion '' phase of the entrainment process @xcite .",
    "the velocity field is then likely to have significant small - scale structure which is not included in our model , but our estimates of average bulk flow speed are unlikely to be seriously affected . even if there is no dissipation or dynamo action in such a turbulent flow , there will be significant amplification of the magnetic field by shear , so the simplest adiabatic models , which assume laminar flow ( section  [ phys - parms ] ) , will be inappropriate .",
    "another way to distinguish stellar mass loading from entrainment across the jet boundary is to ask whether stellar processes can provide the mass input rate required to produce the observed deceleration .",
    "it is clear from the work of @xcite and @xcite that a jet which is decelerated purely by stellar mass loading will tend to reaccelerate on large scales , where the stellar density becomes low but the outward pressure gradient and buoyancy force are still appreciable .",
    "our models require continuous deceleration in the outer region , favouring boundary - layer entrainment as the dominant mechanism there .",
    "we address this question via a conservation - law analysis in @xcite , where we conclude that entrainment dominates after the beginning of the flaring region .",
    "little is known about the properties of turbulent relativistic shear layers , or of the viscosity mechanisms likely to predominate in magnetized relativistic jets .",
    "we can not therefore relate the deduced velocity profiles to the internal physics of the jets .",
    "we note however that @xcite computed steady - state models for viscous jets in constant - pressure atmospheres and estimated both the transverse velocity profiles and appearance of the jets ( on the assumption that the emissivity is directly proportional to the viscous dissipation ) for several forms of the viscosity .",
    "baan s models generally predicted extended low - velocity wings that do not match our derived profiles .",
    "he did however discuss circumstances under which flat - topped velocity profiles such as those inferred here might arise , including that of an electron - positron jet .",
    "we have determined the variation of @xmath17 ( proportional to the emissivity ) in the rest frame of the emitting material .",
    "separation of this variation into particle and field contributions requires additional assumptions .",
    "the x - ray emission from the jets @xcite is most likely to be synchrotron , rather than inverse compton radiation , so we can not use it to decouple the particle and field components .",
    "we therefore postpone a discussion of the variation of pressure and density along the jet to @xcite , where we also consider x - ray observations of the surrounding hot gas .    a number of authors @xcite have recently re - opened the possibility that the jets in fri radio galaxies are adiabatic in the sense first defined by @xcite , i.e.  that the particles suffer only adiabatic energy losses , there are no dissipative processes causing particle acceleration or field amplification and the magnetic field is convected passively with the flow .",
    "we defer a full discussion of this question to a later paper , since our data and models are both substantially more complicated than is allowed by the analytical approaches in the literature @xcite .",
    "the simplest adiabatic models do not allow for any turbulent flow ( section  [ interaction ] ) and there is independent evidence for particle acceleration in 3c31 s jets from x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can make a number of preliminary qualitative points .",
    "we take the analytical formulae from @xcite . in the absence of velocity shear and in the quasi - one - dimensional approximation , the field components vary as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the jet radius . for a purely longitudinal field , this leads to a variation of the rest - frame emissivity : @xmath40 and for a perpendicular field ( @xmath41 ) : @xmath42    the inner region poses a severe problem for the simplest adiabatic models : we have no evidence for deceleration so , if the conical region is fully filled , we would expect a very rapid brightness decline away from the nucleus ( @xmath43 on - axis even in the perpendicular - field case ) compared with our estimates of @xmath44 for the spine and @xmath45 for the shear layer . even for the steepest emissivity fall - off allowed by our error analysis ( table  [ params ] ) , the indices are grossly discrepant .",
    "we have already argued that much of the emission in the inner region may come from a surface layer ( section  [ inner - probs ] ) and the assumption that the radiating material expands with constant opening angle may be invalid .    for the flaring and outer regions , we have computed the emissivity variations for the parallel- and perpendicular - field cases using our model for the radius and velocity of the jet .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ em - long ] , where we have normalized the adiabatic models to the observed emissivities at the beginnings of the flaring and outer regions .",
    "two example streamlines are shown for the ssl model : on - axis in the spine and at the inner edge of the shear layer .",
    "the adiabatic models predict emissivities which fall far more rapidly than is observed in the flaring region : the deceleration is too little and too late to compensate for the expansion . in the outer region , by contrast , the perpendicular - field adiabatic model predicts emissivities fairly close to those observed .",
    "there are two other fundamental problems with the adiabatic models .",
    "first , the field structure in the flaring region is not consistent with passive convection in a smooth , axisymmetric velocity field .",
    "our assumed velocity field acts so as to shear an existing radial component , thereby amplifying the component along the flow .",
    "it can not , therefore , create the region of approximately isotropic field at the edge of the flaring region starting with what is essentially a mixture of toroidal and longitudinal components .",
    "second , the assumed velocity field _ can not _ change the ratio of radial to toroidal field .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ bcomp - grey ] that the radial component essentially disappears at some point after the flaring region .",
    "we conclude that simple adiabatic models could not describe the inner and flaring regions , even if more realistic field configurations and the effects of velocity shear were to be included , but that a model of this type may apply to the outer region , at least if the radial field component is mostly eliminated by the outer boundary .",
    "further investigation of this set of problems is outside the scope of the present paper and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the best - fitting spine / shear - layer models require the jets to be at 52@xmath1 to the line of sight .    fig .",
    "[ otherangles ] shows the appearance of these models if observed with the jet axis at other angles to the line of sight at a resolution of 0.75arcsec .",
    "we have not modelled the core , but need to make a crude estimate of the dependence of its flux density on @xmath20 in order to illustrate the effects of observing with limited dynamic range . for these calculations",
    "the effective flow velocity in the core has been arbitrarily set at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and its flux is assumed to scale with angle according to the predictions of a simple single - velocity model for a pair of oppositely directed , identical jets : @xmath48^{-(2+\\alpha_c ) } + [ \\gamma(1+\\beta\\cos\\theta)]^{-(2+\\alpha_c)}\\ ] ] the spectral index of the core , @xmath49 .",
    "the models are shown for @xmath20=90@xmath1 ( jet axes in the plane of the sky ) , then for @xmath20 decreasing in 20@xmath1 steps to 30@xmath1 .",
    "the final model is shown at @xmath20=18@xmath1 as this is close to the limiting case that our code can compute , wherein the line of sight lies inside the widest cone angle subtended by the jet outflow at the nucleus ( in the flaring region ) .",
    "the left panels show how the jets would appear if they could be observed at these angles to the line of sight with the same limiting sensitivity as in our vla data for 3c31 , using logarithmically spaced contours .",
    "[ otherangles - hires ] shows a similar display for an observing resolution of 0.25arcsec fwhm , emphasizing the changes in appearance of the inner jet and the start of the flaring region .",
    "the @xmath20=90@xmath1 case is , of course , symmetrical with two identical centre - brightened jets that lack well - defined intensity maxima at their bases .",
    "images of 3c449 @xcite and pks1333@xmath5033 @xcite show precisely these features .    at @xmath20=70@xmath1",
    ", we see the effects of moderate differences in the doppler boost between the two sides : the base of the main jet appears brighter , and the counter - jet is both dimmer and less centrally - peaked than the main jet ( compare 3c296 ; @xcite ) . at @xmath20=50@xmath1 , we see essentially the symmetries observed in 3c31 s jets .",
    "note that the counter - jet brightens on an absolute scale at lower inclination angles @xmath20 because each line of sight now intersects a longer absolute path length through both jets . at @xmath20=30@xmath1 ,",
    "the bright base of the main jet is effectively contiguous with the unresolved core , and at @xmath20=18@xmath1 the characterization of the structure as a  jet \" according to the usual criteria @xcite would be questionable at this resolution .",
    "by @xmath20=18@xmath1 , the apparent flux density of the core has also increased from 0.03 jy at @xmath20=90@xmath1 to 1.6 jy .",
    "this makes it unlikely that the wide - angle emission from the outer layers of the jet would be detected except in observations specifically designed for high dynamic range ( or low angular resolution ) .",
    "the right panels illustrate this by plotting the same five models with logarithmically spaced contours at fixed percentages of the apparent peak intensity , to a limit of 1/750 of the peak .",
    "the contours are chosen to match the appearance of the left panel for the @xmath20=90@xmath1 case .",
    "these `` constant dynamic range '' displays probably correspond better to `` standard '' radio astronomical observations that have not been specially optimized to detect faint broad features in the presence of strong compact components . for @xmath20=30@xmath1 and @xmath20=18@xmath1 ,",
    "most of the emission detected outside the compact core comes from close to the spine of the approaching jet .",
    "images of bl lac objects such as 3c371 @xcite and mkn501 @xcite show qualitatively similar features , although the effects of projection exaggerate deviations from axisymmetry .",
    "[ otherangles - pol ] shows the variation of polarization with angle at two different resolutions .",
    "the relative separation of the parallel  perpendicular apparent field transitions in the main and counter - jets from the nucleus is a strong function of inclination .",
    "for the main jet , the transition point moves away from the nucleus into the flaring region as @xmath20 drops from 90 to 45@xmath1 , despite the opposite effect of projection on the position of the flaring point .",
    "as @xmath20 decreases still further , the transition moves closer to the nucleus again .",
    "in contrast , the field transition in the counter - jet moves monotonically closer to the nucleus as @xmath20 decreases , with the parallel - field region being essentially invisible for @xmath51 .",
    "the longitudinal apparent field at the edges of the jets also becomes less prominent as @xmath20 increases , and would be difficult to detect for @xmath52 90@xmath1 in observations with limited sensitivity .",
    "both effects are inevitable consequence of the toroidal / longitudinal field structure .",
    "we expect them to be general features of fri sources , testable for complete samples even where detailed modelling is impossible because of intrinsic asymmetry or low signal - to - noise .",
    "there is little published data on field transition distances , but 3c296 @xcite and 0755 + 379 @xcite indeed have transition points further from the nucleus in their main jets .",
    "figs  [ otherangles][otherangles - pol ] explicitly demonstrate the possibility of generating a variety of apparent fri jet structures with the same physical model by varying the orientation and of unifying fri radio galaxies with some classes of `` one - sided '' objects .",
    "they also illustrate the need for careful consideration of observational selection effects when analysing statistical properties of unified models . in the presence of a _ range _ of flow velocities both along and across every jet",
    ", observational selection through limited sensitivity and dynamic range translates into velocity selection within the jets .",
    "a key byproduct of our models may be a way to guide the statistical interpretation of jet velocities in blazar - fri unification models , as discussed by @xcite .    the analysis of jet sidedness and width ratios for a complete sample by @xcite shows that our models are likely to apply in detail to the inner parts of the majority of fri jets ( i.e.  before bending and other intrinsic effects become dominant ) .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that some model parameters vary systematically from source to source : in particular , the length of the inner region and the characteristic scale of deceleration appear to increase with radio luminosity",
    "we have shown that an intrinsically symmetrical , decelerating relativistic jet model containing simple prescriptions for the velocity field and emissivity with a locally random but anisotropic magnetic field , accounts for the major features revealed by deep vla imaging of the straight segments of the jet and counter - jet in 3c31 .",
    "the principal new features of our approach are :    1 .",
    "the use of three - dimensional ( but axisymmetric ) parameterized models of velocity , emissivity and field ordering ; 2 .",
    "rigorous calculation of synchrotron emission , including both relativistic aberration and anisotropy in the rest frame ; 3 .",
    "fitting to images with many independent data - points in linear polarization as well as total intensity using a robust optimization algorithm .",
    "a major result of this modelling is that the three regions of the jet that were initially identified purely from the shape of the outer isophotes ( fig .",
    "[ geom - sketch ] ) are also regions with distinctly different internal variations of velocity and emissivity .",
    "our conclusions for this region are tentative because of the limited transverse resolution of the data .",
    "the region is characterized by :    1 .",
    "low intrinsic emissivity ; 2 .",
    "slow lateral expansion ( a cone of intrinsic half - angle 6.7@xmath1 ) and 3 .   a significant component of emission arising in slow - moving material .",
    "the fitted central velocity is 0.8  0.9@xmath2 .",
    "we have no evidence for deceleration in this region , but we can not exclude the presence of higher - velocity ( doppler - hidden ) flow components .",
    "simple adiabatic models are grossly inconsistent with the emissivity profile .",
    "this region was defined initially by the more rapid spreading of its outer isophotes .",
    "our modelling shows it to be a region in which several dramatic changes in the other jet characteristics occur together :    1 .",
    "the jets decelerate rapidly to an on - axis velocity of 0.55@xmath2 after an initial slow decline from 0.77@xmath2 .",
    "they maintain a transverse velocity profile in which the edge velocity drops to approximately 70% of the on - axis value .",
    "3 .   the intrinsic emissivity increases abruptly at the boundary with the inner region , then declines with distance from the nucleus , @xmath53 , as @xmath54 in the shear layer and @xmath55 in the spine .",
    "4 .   the emissivity at the edges of the jet drops to about 20% of that on the jet axis . 5 .",
    "the radial component of the magnetic field in the shear layer becomes significant , rising from zero at the spine boundary to 90% of the toroidal and longitudinal components at the outer edge of the layer , i.e.  the field is essentially isotropic at the outer boundary of the shear layer in this region .",
    "6 .   the ratio of longitudinal to toroidal field strength decreases slightly from about 1.1 to 0.8 , independent of radius in the jet .",
    "the sudden increase in rest - frame emissivity at the flaring point suggests that there is a discontinuity in the flow , perhaps a stationary reconfinement shock system . the brightness and polarization structure in this region",
    "can not be described by a simple adiabatic model .",
    "the transverse velocity profile and the growth of the radial field component strongly suggest that entrainment across the jet boundary becomes important .      in this region ,",
    "the jets continue to expand on a cone of intrinsic half - angle 13.1@xmath1 .    1 .",
    "the jets decelerate less rapidly , reaching an on - axis velocity of 0.26@xmath2 by 10kpc .",
    "the intrinsic emissivity in the shear layer declines more slowly ( @xmath56 ) with distance from the nucleus .",
    "the transverse velocity and emissivity profiles remain essentially unchanged from those in the flaring region .",
    "4 .   the ratio of radial to toroidal magnetic field strength decreases , becoming @xmath57% throughout the jet by 10kpc .",
    "the ratio of longitudinal to toroidal magnetic field in the shear layer continues to decrease , from 0.8 to 0.5 by 10kpc .",
    "although the emissivity fall - off is much closer to that predicted by a perpendicular - field , laminar adiabatic model , more work is needed to test this idea for realistic field and particle distributions .    beyond the end of the outer region ,",
    "intrinsic environmental asymmetries begin to dominate , as evidenced by the large - scale bending of both jets .",
    "we have also calculated the change in appearance of our model brightness and polarization distributions as functions of orientation .",
    "these are in good qualitative agreement with observations of other well - observed jets and we therefore expect the model ( with some parameter variations ) to apply to fri jets in general .",
    "figures  [ otherangles ] and [ otherangles - hires ] show that the intensity changes are considerably more complex than would be expected for single - velocity jets .",
    "they emphasize the need for high dynamic range and sensitivity to possible wide - angle jet structures when assessing whether observed jet properties are consistent with unified models .",
    "we predict changes in polarization with orientation ( figure  [ otherangles - pol ] ) : these provide an independent test of unified models provided that our proposed field configuration is present in all fri jets .",
    "we now intend to model other resolvable bright jets in fri radio galaxies to determine the extent to which their observed brightness and polarization properties resemble those of 3c31 .",
    "we expect to be able to infer their velocity , emissivity and magnetic - field distributions , building on the broad success of the jet - deceleration model in accounting for the statistical asymmetries of the b2 sample of fri sources @xcite .",
    "other sources showing well - collimated inner jets and rapid flaring include ngc315 @xcite , pks1333@xmath5033 @xcite and 3c449 @xcite , and it seems likely that the regimes of collimation behaviour we have identified in 3c31 are common in fri sources .",
    "we aim to study a sample of sources with a range of angles to the line of sight , if possible distributed isotropically , in order to test the results of section  [ angles ] .",
    "we also plan to develop a more sophisticated error analysis in order to assess confidence levels with some degree of rigour .",
    "3c31 has been cited as the archetypal fri source , but is actually in the minority in having diffuse `` tails '' of emission extending to large distances from the core rather than confined bridges analogous to the lobes of frii sources @xcite .",
    "significant differences in dynamics ( especially entrainment of the surrounding medium ) might be expected between the two classes .",
    "we also expect that the deceleration process should depend on the jet power and the external environment .    in @xcite , we present a dynamical model for the jets in 3c31 , based on the velocity field derived in the present paper , a description of the surrounding galactic atmosphere derived from _",
    "chandra _ and rosat observations @xcite and application of conservation laws following @xcite .",
    "this approach should also be extensible to other sources .",
    "our results favour entrainment across the boundary layer as the origin of the majority of the mass - loading of the jets in 3c31 , but it will be important to explore this in other large - scale fri radio galaxies .",
    "we should seek further evidence for the entrainment process , such as the reduced polarization near the boundaries of the flaring regions .",
    "our ultimate goal is to replace the empirical descriptions of velocity , emissivity and field structure with realistic physical models .",
    "although this is some way off , we have developed a self - consistent adiabatic model which can handle arbitrary field configurations and ( laminar ) velocity fields in a relativistic jet , with the aim of establishing whether any of the flow regions we have identified can be described in this way .",
    "if our interpretation of the emission from the inner region of 3c31 s jets is correct , observations of the apparent brightness and motions of fri jets on even smaller scales will _ not _ be sensitive to the properties of the underlying bulk flow , but only to those of its slowest - moving components , which may be essentially stochastic . improved transverse resolution of the inner jets in such sources will be required to determine the origin and distribution of the slow - moving material , and the extent to which these innermost regions of fri jets resemble the larger - scale jets in frii sources , e.g.  those in 3c353 @xcite .",
    "this will require greater sensitivity and longer baselines than are currently available with the vla or merlin .",
    "finally , a number of fri sources ( including 3c31 ) have been detected at x - ray and/or optical wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation is most plausibly produced by the synchrotron process over the entire observed frequency range , and the shape of the spectrum therefore carries information about particle acceleration and energy loss",
    ". it will be important to incorporate descriptions of these processes into our models .",
