    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are semi - detached interacting binary systems containing a white dwarf ( wd ) primary and a late - type main - sequence secondary ( ms ) which transfers mass onto the primary through roche lobe overflow , see @xcite for a review .",
    "strong and broad emission lines are a common observational feature in the majority of cvs , probing the dissipative processes within the accretion flow .",
    "the hydrogen balmer series usually dominate the spectrum , and in the vast majority of spectroscopic studies of cvs serve as the main proxy for determining the system parameters",
    ". however , relatively unexplored spectral features remain , such as the ca  ii triplet lines in the i - band .",
    "common emission line sources include the accretion disc , the interaction point of the gas stream with the disc ( hot spot ) and the irradiated face of the secondary star .",
    "gw lib is a dwarf nova ( dn ) which was discovered by @xcite as it went onto its first recorded outburst and rapidly increased in brightness by 8 magnitudes .",
    "it remained in its quiescent state after that period of activity until 2007 .",
    "@xcite found three periodicities in the quiescent photometric light curve at 236 , 376 and 650 s , making the primary in gw lib the first multi - period non - radial pulsating wd in an accreting binary .",
    "@xcite measured the radial velocity curve using h@xmath8 and determined a rather short orbital period of @xmath9  min . in the latest ritter & kolb catalogue , only 8 systems with a smaller period are known when excluding the am cvn systems which have h - deficient donors @xcite , implying an evolved binary close to the period minimum . from model",
    "fits to the wd absorption troughs and mean spectra , various temperatures have been found .",
    "uv spectra suggest @xmath10  k with a wd mass of @xmath11 @xcite or a dual temperature wd with @xmath12  k and @xmath13  k. the latter model can only explain the observed uv / optical pulse amplitude ratio in gw lib ( see table 2 in @xcite ) as compared with single pulsating zz - ceti stars , if the wd mass of gw  lib is larger than @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite fit the optical balmer line profiles to find @xmath15  k and @xmath16 .",
    "however , all temperature estimates place the wd outside the zz ceti instability strip for single wd pulsators . a mass determination based on the detected pulsation periods combined with distance and uv flux constraints suggests a wd mass of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "on 2007 april 12 , amateur astronomers reported the sudden and rapid brightening of gw lib @xcite indicating renewed outburst activity , 24 years after the discovery outburst .",
    "the outburst had an amplitude of @xmath18 9 magnitudes and lasted for several weeks , see figure [ fig : ew ] .",
    "we present the first time - resolved optical spectroscopy of gw lib in ( super)outburst ( section [ sec : outburst ] ) alongside time - resolved optical spectroscopy during quiescence before and after the outburst ( section [ sec : calcium ] ) .",
    "we present the possible system parameters in section [ sec : systemparameters ] and the discussion in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the formal scenario assumes that corrections that need to be applied to our @xmath4 and @xmath20 constraints are modest . thus implying that the mass ratio is near its limit : @xmath21 .",
    "the right hand column in table [ tab : systemparameters ] list the derived system parameters for this ratio .",
    "@xcite calculated the inclination based on the fwhm of the shallow peaked balmer emission lines in quiescence compared to the fwhm of wz  sge and found @xmath22 .",
    "this is in agreement with our calculations in combination with the nominal solution for @xmath23 and confirms that gw  lib is indeed observed at very low inclination .    for @xmath24 ,",
    "the correction for @xmath20 , as derived from our models , is at most @xmath25  km  s@xmath1 giving a maximum value for @xmath20 of @xmath26  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the main problem with a high value for @xmath27 near our limit is that the secondary would then need to be a @xmath28 mass star with a spectral type around m4-m5 ( @xcite ) . in that case",
    ", spectral features should be visible in a high resolution , high signal to noise red spectrum .",
    "we can not identify any of such in our post - outburst i - band spectra nor in the pre - outburst magellan data .",
    "additional issues are the observed ir magnitudes of gw  lib which imply a faint donor and a main - sequence object near @xmath29 would not fit within the roche - lobe .",
    "all adding to the conclusion that the mass - ratio in gw  lib is likely not near this maximum value .      measuring the late superhumps in gw lib , @xcite found an extreme mass ratio for the system of @xmath31 . which , when combined with the wd mass from seismology and the empirical donor star mass from the @xcite sequence , proves an attractive solution within the boundaries of the formal scenario .",
    "we calculated the magnitude of the k - correction at this mass ratio using our irradiated secondary model . in order to produce the observed @xmath32  km  s@xmath1",
    ", we find a true @xmath33  km  s@xmath1 where the error is calculated by propagating the error on @xmath34 .",
    "this error dominates over effects such as the assumed level of equatorial shielding or the optical thickness of the emission .",
    "the implied system parameters based on this assumed @xmath27 and calculated @xmath20 can be found in the left hand column of table [ tab : systemparameters ] .",
    "the small mass ratio scenario would correspond to a low mass donor with a m8 @xcite or t spectral type @xcite if the donor is close to its main - sequence configuration .",
    "this would agree with the infrared magnitude constraints mentioned previously and fits perfectly with gw  lib being close to the period minimum .",
    "interestingly , the derived @xmath4 in this scenario is close to the measured radial velocity of the narrow balmer emission component in outburst ( @xmath35  km  s@xmath1 ) suggesting that this component may trace the wd when irradiated by the accretion disc .",
    "similar sharp emission components from the wd are seen in am  cvn systems ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a component arising at the surface of a wd is expected to be gravitationally red - shifted but the systemic velocity for this lines component was @xmath36  km  s@xmath1 which is similar to the systemic velocity of the system and can not be biased by the stark effect as is the case in am  cvn systems .",
    "unfortunately the emission is only a transient feature and the constraint on its @xmath37 will be difficult to improve upon .",
    "the origin of the component and its possible connection with the wd thus remains unclear .",
    "we presented time - resolved optical spectroscopy of gw  lib during a large number of epochs spanning before , throughout and after the 2007 outburst .",
    "we studied the long - term evolution of the spectral features tracking large changes in the accretion geometry and intensity .",
    "pre - outburst spectroscopy obtained in 2004 data show clear features of the accreting wd including a detection of mg  ii absorption . here",
    ", the low inclination of gw  lib has the advantage over high inclination system as it gives narrow disc emission lines instead of wide profiles , potentially resolving the line from the nearby he  i line .",
    "higher resolution , high signal to noise spectra around this line in quiescence could provide a dynamical trace of the accreting wd and give a directly measured mass constraint to complement the constraints indirectly obtained from seismology .    during the outburst",
    ", we initially see the optically thick accretion disc dominate through broad absorption features .",
    "their radial velocity does not trace the wd and show semi - amplitudes of order 50 km / s .",
    "a peculiar sharp emission line component was found in the balmer lines that is effectively stationary .",
    "this could be some low velocity outflow in the z - direction or a component near the wd , but its mean velocity is similar to @xmath2 whereas a layer near the high gravity wd should be gravitationally red - shifted . as the system fades back towards quiescence , accretion powered",
    "double - peaked emission profiles appear .",
    "the absorption associated with the accretion disc continues to weaken until the system returns to a semi - quiescent state with strong double - peaked emission lines .",
    "the ca  ii triplet in gw lib shows that these much neglected lines of cv spectra could be an interesting window to search for signs of both donor stars and accretion disc structures even in cases where the balmer lines show no signs of the donor star whatsoever and the disc itself is barely resolved .",
    "gw  lib is a particularly challenging object in that sense due its very low inclination and thus small projected velocities .",
    "the ca  ii triplet in emission could be resolved into several components and the secondary star was discovered in emission moving in between the sharp double - peaked emission from the accretion disc .",
    "doppler tomography and radial velocity profiles fits of the ca  ii lines provide a semi - amplitude of @xmath38  km  s@xmath1 for this donor star feature and indicates a disc centre of symmetry at @xmath39  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the disc is also visible in the h@xmath40 maps but with less detail and sharpness and no donor star contribution is seen .",
    "contrasting these lines highlights the diagnostic advantages provided by the ca  ii triplet .",
    "based on previous studies together with the limits on @xmath4 and @xmath20 provided in this work , the allowed range of binary parameters were explored . while our dynamical limits place a hard upper limit on the binary mass ratio of @xmath5 , we favour a significantly lower value . a mass ratio near @xmath6 is in accordance with estimates based on the detected super - hump modulations , the constraints on the faintness , and thus mass , of the donor star and the indications that @xmath4 is very small .",
    "given such a mass ratio , our measured @xmath34 implies @xmath33  km  s@xmath1 for the donor star component when applying the relevant k - correction .",
    "the implied @xmath41  km  s@xmath1 is then also close to our measured disc centre of symmetry . the combination of a wd mass near the value suggested by the pulsations and a low mass donor near the empirical sequence of an evolved cv near the period bounce appears to be consistent with the observational constraints to date .    whether the spectral features observed several months after the tail end of the 2007 outburst are persistent remains to be established . as the wd continues to cool",
    ", donor star irradiation may be less effective in exciting the strong ca  ii lines we observed .",
    "nonetheless , high resolution spectroscopy resolving these lines at good s / n levels appears to be a viable tool to expand our knowledge of the binary parameters of short period cataclysmic variables and their faint donor stars .",
