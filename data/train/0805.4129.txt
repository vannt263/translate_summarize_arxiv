    "since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in doped antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulators , the research on that phenomenon concentrates to a great extent on the properties of single - particle - like excitations in such systems .",
    "it is also obvious that the microscopic mechanism of htsc should hinge on the interaction between quasiparticles . at half filling the hubbard model , which is a generic model used to describe strongly correlated systems ,",
    "is an insulator for large enough @xmath1@xcite whereas for low electron density the model is expected to be a fermi liquid with a fermi surface volume in accordance with the luttinger theorem for any @xmath1@xcite . with increasing doping one might therefore expect a phase transition from a ` correlation dominated ' phase near half - filling to a fermi - liquid phase for low density .",
    "the key property of the correlation dominated phase thereby is the splitting of the physical electron into the two hubbard bands which correspond to fermionic holes and double occupancies moving in a ` background ' of singly occupied sites , whereby the electrons forming the background retain only their spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this - and not a half - filled fermi surface - is the picture underlying all successful theories for the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data@xcite obtained in insulating compounds @xcite .",
    "the question then is to what extent these hubbard bands can be doped before the two - band structure collapses , the spin background ` melts ' into a fermi sea and the luttinger fermi surface is regained .",
    "the key property of this ` doped insulator ' phase should be a fermi surface with a volume proportional to the number of doped holes because these are the only mobile fermions .",
    "arpes on cuprate superconductors has produced a wealth of information@xcite although it has proven difficult to extract a consistent picture .",
    "from spectra taken near optimal doping it was concluded that arpes shows evidence for a ` large ' fermi surface consistent with the luttinger theorem and band calculations@xcite which would imply that the doped hubbard bands never exist .",
    "surprisingly enough , however , insulating compounds such as sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 seemed to show a very similar fermi surface as well - which has been termed the ` remnant fermi surface'@xcite .",
    "arpes spectra from insulators show a band which disperses towards lower binding energy and then rapidly looses weight just as if it would cross a fermi level .",
    "the only possible explanation for this phenomenon is a strong and systematic variation of the spectral weight of the conduction band which drops to near zero abruptly at a line in @xmath3-space which roughly coincides with the noninteracting fermi surface",
    ". one can give simple arguments why such a behaviour is to be expected@xcite .",
    "since there is no reason why such a strong variation of spectral weight and bands with almost no spectral weight should occur only in insulators one should be cautioned that fermi surface maps for doped compounds may not show the full picture either .    in the underdoped compounds the upper hubbard band , while rapidly loosing spectral weight , still can be clearly resolved@xcite .",
    "arpes shows rather structureless spectra which are usually interpreted in terms of a ` high energy feature ' and a ` leading edge shift ' or , alternatively , a high energy and low energy pseudogap@xcite . in any case",
    "there is definitely no ` large ' fermi surface , instead fermi surface maps show ` fermi arcs ' .",
    "bearing in mind the remnant fermi surface in the insulators suggests to interpret these arcs as being the inner part of a hole pocket centered on @xmath4 with the part of the pocket facing @xmath5 having too small spectral weight to be seen in arpes .",
    "assuming that the electronic structure in the underdoped compound can be described in simplest approximation as holes doped into the quasiparticle band of the insulator moreover would give an explanation for the high energy pseudogap - the dispersion of the ` high energy feature ' - in that it simply reflects the hole dispersion in the insulator@xcite .",
    "such a ` strict ' rigid band picture would not explain the low energy pseudogap or the temperature and doping dependence of either high or low energy pseudogap .",
    "on the other hand the closing of the pseudogap with increasing doping can be seen already in cluster simulations@xcite and it has been pointed out there that the mechanism may be an effective downward renormalization of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms due to decrease in the spin correlation length . moreover , the low energy pseudogap by its definition in terms of the leading edge shift has no immediate connection with a dispersion and may be determined e.g. by @xmath8-dependent linewidths as discussed by storey _ et al._@xcite .",
    "the compound ca@xmath9na@xmath10cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 shows rather clear evidence for the doped insulator picture@xcite in that the dispersion in the doped case is virtually identical to that in the undoped compound and even the part of the quasiparticle band facing @xmath5 may have been observed.very recently arpes experiments seem to have provided direct evidence for hole pockets in la@xmath11nd@xmath12sr@xmath13cuo@xmath14@xcite , with the part of the pockets facing @xmath5 indeed having small spectral weight - as one would have expected on the basis of the remnant fermi surface .",
    "it had been noted early on @xcite that hole pockets with a volume proportional to the hole concentration would explain the scaling of the low temperature hall constant with hole concentration in the underdoped materials @xcite and that the apparent discrepancy between the ` small fermi surface ' suggested by transport measurements and the ` large fermi surface ' seen in arpes may be due to a systematic variation of the quasiparticle weight along the hole pocket.@xcite . while the recent discovery @xcite of shubnikov - dehaas oscillations in some underdoped compounds initially seemed to provide strong evidence for hole pockets the finding that the oscillations are likely caused by electron - like rather than hole - like pockets@xcite has complicated matters again .",
    "lastly , exact diagonalization studies of the t - j model provide clear evidence that the fermi surface for hole dopings around 10@xmath15 takes the form of hole pockets@xcite . careful analysis of exact diagonalization results shows that the single particle the spectral function for the doped t - j model is quite consistent with rigid band filling of the quasiparticle band seen at half - filling , provided one takes into account the formation of hole pairs@xcite . by calculating the spectral function for dressed hole operators@xcite rather than the bare electron operators is can moreover be shown that the quasiparticles in the doped system have very nearly the same internal structure as in the undoped one@xcite .    here",
    "we take the point of view that the underdoped regime in high - temperature superconductors precisely corresponds to the doped insulator phase .",
    "we show that many properties of the underdoped phase - the remnant fermi surface , the fermi arcs , the high - energy feature seen in arpes , the mid infrared band seen in the optical conductivity - find a simple and natural explanation in the dispersion and internal structure of the quasiparticles which correspond to holes heavily dressed by spin excitations . since there are indications that the heavily overdoped phase is essentially a fermi liquid this",
    "would imply that the phase transition from the correlation dominated phase to the fermi liquid phase occurs at optimal doping .",
    "this would then be a quantum phase transition where none of the two phases has any kind of order - rather they differ in the topology and volume of their fermi surfaces .",
    "an indication of this transition can in fact be seen in the dynamical spin and density correlation function obtained by exact diagonalization of small clusters . in the underdoped regime spin and density correlation functions",
    "are very different and the density correlation function takes the form of extended incoherent continua@xcite this form of the density correlation function can be explained quantitatively within the string picture for a single hole@xcite . for doping levels higher than optimal , spin and density correlation",
    "function become similar and can be explained well as particle - hole transitions across an essentially free - electron - like fermi surface@xcite .    while a theory for such a transition would be highly desirable but very challenging the present paper has a more modest goal :",
    "we want to show that many features of undoped and underdoped cuprates can be explained by a very simple theory which assumes continuity with the insulator .",
    "the calculation will be performed in the framework of the t - j model@xcite extended by terms enabling hopping to second and third nearest neighbors with hopping integrals @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively@xcite .",
    "we use standard values @xmath16ev , @xmath17 ev , @xmath18 ev , and @xmath19ev chosen so as to reproduce the measured fermi surface of hole doped cuprates for high doping levels .",
    "since we want to study the doped insulator we consider the motion of a single hole in an antiferromagnetically ordered ` spin background ' . all processes analyzed in the",
    "following actually require only short range antiferromagnetic correlations - one may therefore expect that hole motion in a state with short range antiferromagnetic order but no long range order will involve very similar processes so that e.g. the internal structure of the quasiparticles and the dispersion relation of a hole should not change drastically .",
    "the construction of spin polaron ( sp ) states including the excited states was performed in several earlier publications @xcite . in order to make this paper self - contained we will now briefly repeat that construction . for definiteness",
    "we will assume that a @xmath20-spin has been removed from the system and study the motion of the resulting hole .",
    "we denote the @xmath20-sublattice by @xmath21 .    to begin with",
    "we define @xmath22 to be the sum of the nearest neighbor hopping @xmath23 and the longitudinal part of the heisenberg exchange : @xmath24 @xmath25 is frequently referred to as the @xmath26 model . in a first step ,",
    "we seek approximate eigenstates of @xmath25 which are localized due to the string effect .    the mechanism of the string effect is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "( color online ) the mechanism of the string effect .",
    "slanted crosses represent links with the contribution to the ising part of the exchange energy higher by @xmath27 as compared to the nel state .",
    "( b ) , a string state obtained by a single move of the hole created at site @xmath28 .",
    "( c ) , ( d ) , states obtained respectively by two and three consecutive moves . ]    by creating a hole in the nel state - i.e. the ground state of @xmath29 - at site @xmath28 and acting repeatedly with the hopping term we generate a basis of string states @xmath30 where @xmath31 is shorthand for the sites @xmath32 visited by the hole .",
    "all spins on these sites have been displaced by one lattice spacing and thus are inverted relative to the nel order .",
    "all @xmath30 are eigenstates of @xmath29 . taking the energy of the string with length @xmath33 i.e. the bare hole as the zero of energy and denoting by @xmath34 the length of the string - i.e.",
    "the number of shifted spins - the eigenvalue is @xmath35 this is exact for @xmath36 and is true for ` most ' longer strings as well . for simplicity",
    "we assume ( [ ising ] ) to be true for any string .",
    "this implies that the hole is trapped in a linearly ascending potential and all eigenstates of @xmath25 are localized .",
    "the main deviations from ( [ ising ] ) occur for ` loops ' as discussed by trugman@xcite which in fact lead to hole - propagation even in the @xmath26 model .",
    "such loops pose no fundamental problem for the present formalism and can be dealt with by introducing the concept of ` irreducible paths ' as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next we note that by acting with a point group operation , which leaves the initial site @xmath28 invariant , the string states @xmath30 are transformed into one another .",
    "we can therefore define linear combinations of the @xmath30 which transform like the basis states of the irreducible representations of @xmath37 under these point group operations .",
    "then we make the following ansatz for a localized eigenstate of @xmath25 @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the symmetry or ` orbital character ' of the state and @xmath40 labels the excitation number for a given symmetry . in keeping with ( [ ising ] )",
    "we moreover assume that each coefficient @xmath41 can be factorized into a sign @xmath42 - which plays the role of an ` angular wave function ' - and a ` radial wave function ' @xmath43 which depends only on the length of the string : @xmath44 for an @xmath45 ( @xmath46-wave ) state the sign @xmath47 is obviously uniform for all paths . for an @xmath48 ( @xmath49-wave ) or @xmath50 ( @xmath51-wave ) state @xmath47",
    "is determined by the direction of the first hop away from the site @xmath28 as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the string of length @xmath33 i.e. the bare hole at site @xmath28 is invariant under all point group operations and hence has nonvanishing weight only in the @xmath46-like state - this implies that @xmath48 and @xmath50 states are higher in energy than the @xmath45 state because the are composed of strings with length @xmath52 and hence a minimum of three frustrated bonds .",
    "for the two remaining representations @xmath53",
    "( @xmath54-wave ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath56-wave ) it can be shown that only strings with a minimum length of @xmath57 have nonvanishing weight in the corresponding sp states - these states therefore are even higher in energy and we omit them .",

    "( b ) , @xmath58-wave sp , ( c ) , and @xmath59-wave sp , ( d ) . for completeness",
    "the schematic representation for the @xmath46-wave sp has also been shown , ( a ) . ]    for each symmetry sector @xmath60 we can now set up the schrdinger equation @xmath61 thereby assuming ( [ ising ] ) and solve for the eigenenergies @xmath62 and the coefficients @xmath63 - this is explained in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "as expected for a linearly ascending potential , the @xmath63 s are rapidly decreasing with increasing length of the string even for the physical parameter range @xmath64 .",
    "it turns out the schrdinger equation for the coefficients @xmath63 for the @xmath51 sp is identical to that for the @xmath49-like ones . to shorten the notation we call the coefficients @xmath65 for the lowest @xmath46-like sp @xmath66 and instead of those for the @xmath49-like sp , @xmath67 and @xmath68-like sp , @xmath69 we use @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "so far we have found sp states ( [ wvfn ] ) which form a set of approximate localized eigenstates of @xmath25 at each of the sites of the sublattice @xmath21 .",
    "next we note that the remaining part @xmath72 of the @xmath73 m - which comprises the transverse part of the heisenberg exchange and the hopping terms @xmath74 - has nonvanishing matrix elements between sp states centered on neighboring sites @xmath28 and @xmath75 . one important mechanism leading to such a matrix element is the truncation of the string shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "( color online ) ( a)@xmath76(b ) : a string of length @xmath57 starting at @xmath28 is truncated to a string of length @xmath33 at @xmath75 by the transverse part of the heisenberg exchange .",

    "+ ( e ) @xmath77 ( f ) a bare hole at site @xmath28 ( ` string of length @xmath33 ' ) is transported to @xmath75 by @xmath6-hopping . ]    by flipping the first two spins of the defect string the starting point of the string is shifted to a second or third nearest neighbor while the length of the string is reduced by two . since the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath80 of the initial and final string are known by solution of ( [ schroedinger ] ) and the strength of the spin - flip term is @xmath27 the corresponding matrix element is easily evaluated .",
    "similarly , the hopping terms @xmath74 allow for the hopping of the bare hole between the sites of one sublattice ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in addition there is the ` loop hopping'@xcite and actually a wide variety of additional processes , which are discussed in appendix [ appa ] .    assuming that the matrix elements are known we define fourier transforms @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "next we make the lcao - like ansatz for a propagating single - hole state @xmath83 which leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem of the form @xmath84 where the hamilton and overlap matrices are given by @xmath85 and we have introduced the fourier transform of @xmath86 all these matrix elements can be expressed in terms of the coefficients @xmath87 as discussed in the appendix [ appa ] .",
    "once these matrix elements are calculated we readily obtain the band structure for the spin polarons .    to conclude this section we briefly discuss the relationship with previous work .",
    "several authors have studied hole motion in an antiferromagnet by calculations within a string basis@xcite .",
    "the difference is that the diagonalization of @xmath25 leads to a considerable reduction of basis states in that high lying eigenstate of @xmath25 are eliminated from the very beginning .",
    "the matrices to be diagonalized in the present work are @xmath88 or @xmath89 - which is very small compared to the matrix dimensions in refs .",
    "moreover the lcao - like scheme makes it easier to extract a physical picture .",
    "another frequently applied approach is the self - consistent born approximation@xcite .",
    "the single - hole wave function associated with this approximation actually also can be interpreted as a superposition of string states once the fourier - transformed version of the wave function in ref .",
    "@xcite is converted into real space .",
    "this explains why the results e.g. for the dispersion of a single hole are practically identical .",
    "arpes gives the information on the one - electron removal part of the spectral function defined , at @xmath90 , as @xmath91 @xmath92 represents in ( [ sf ] ) the half - filled ground state in which the photoemission process takes place .",
    "since we assume that the rigid band scenario is applicable to cuprates in the low doping range we expect that the conclusions drawn from that analysis are also to some extent applicable to doped systems .    as a first step we approximate the resolvent operator @xmath93 by @xmath94 i.e. we restrict the single hole states to the coherent superposition of sp states ( [ lcao_like ] ) .",
    "+ next , we have to choose an approximate ground state @xmath92 of the heisenberg antiferromagnet . the simplest choice would be the nel state @xmath95 but in this way we would miss an important mechanism for a @xmath3-dependent quasiparticle weight , namely the coupling of the photohole to quantum spin fluctuations . by generating a hole in the nel state we can obtain only a bare hole , i.e. the string of length @xmath33 . in the presence of quantum spin fluctuations the photoemission process can also generate strings of length @xmath79 or @xmath57 - see figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "since in such a process the hole     ( color online ) ( a ) @xmath77 ( b ) : creation of a bare hole at site @xmath28 from the nel state .",
    "( c ) @xmath77 ( d ) : creation of a string of length @xmath79 starting at @xmath28 from the nel state + quantum fluctuation .",
    "( e ) @xmath77 ( f ) : creation of a string of length @xmath57 starting at @xmath28 from the nel state + quantum fluctuation . ]",
    "is created not at the central site @xmath28 of the sp state - which determines the phase factor @xmath96 in the bloch state ( [ bloch ] ) - the photoemission matrix element becomes @xmath3-dependent .",
    "generally speaking the fact that the sp quasiparticles extend over more than one unit cell in real space results in a ` structure factor ' which varies within the first brillouin zone in @xmath3-space . as will be seen below",
    ", this very @xmath3-dependence is the source of the remnant fermi surface . in order to capture this effect",
    "we use simple first order perturbation theory for the quantum spin fluctuations and set @xmath97 since second order perturbation theory gives quite a good estimate for the ground state energy of the heisenberg antiferromagnet we expect that the probability for coupling to a quantum fluctuation with the electron annihilation operator is described quite well by ( [ gs ] ) .",
    "since a quantum fluctuation in the initial states simply gives rise to an extra factor of @xmath98 we immediately obtain the following expressions for the photoemission matrix element @xmath99 @xmath100 using these matrix elements we can now compute the spectral density from the normalized sp eigenfunctions .",
    "if we want to compare to experiment , however , there is yet another important effect we need to take into account , namely the coupling of the photohole to charge fluctuations .",
    "we may expect that the ground state of the system has not only quantum spin fluctuations but also charge fluctuations i.e. an admixture of pairs of holes and double occupancies with a density @xmath101 . by annihilating an electron on a doubly occupied site it is possible to create a string state with an initial site @xmath28 by annihilating an electron at a site different from @xmath28 .",
    "again , this will give rise to a @xmath3-dependence of the spectral weight .",
    "such processes actually are not described by the @xmath73 m , but since it is rather easy to discuss them we do so .",
    "we treat the charge fluctuations in perturbation theory i.e. we replace @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "the hopping terms @xmath104 do not produce charge fluctuations in the nel state . denoting @xmath105",
    "we get the following correction to the matrix element @xmath106 @xmath107 whereas the corrections to @xmath108 and @xmath109 are zero .",
    "it might appear that the corrections due to charge fluctuations are quite small , being anyway @xmath110 . on the other hand , by coupling to charge fluctuations a bare hole at site @xmath28 can be created by actually annihilating an electron on any of its @xmath111 neighbors . by changing from @xmath112 to @xmath113 the corresponding contribution to the photoemission matrix element thus changes from @xmath114 to @xmath115 and since this has to be added before squaring the matrix element the impact of the charge fluctuations is in fact quite strong .",
    "the way in which we are treating charge fluctuations would be adequate for a simple one - band hubbard model , which is not the proper model for cuprate superconductors .",
    "a very similar calculation for the more correct two - band model has bee done by eroles _",
    "et al._@xcite .    in a first calculation",
    "we want to study the low energy band structure . in the lcao - like ansatz ( [ lcao_like ] )",
    "we first restrict ourselves to the lowest state ( i.e. @xmath116 ) for each symmetry @xmath60 so that we have to solve @xmath88 matrices ( we have @xmath117 ) .",
    "the resulting band structure is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "band structure obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem ( [ eigvalprob ] ) .",
    "also shown is the dispersion of bands observed by ronning _ at al._in ca@xmath2cu0@xmath2cl@xmath2@xcite ( circles and triangles ) .",
    "a sample fermi level of a doped system has been chosen as the zero of energy .",
    "vertical arrows label possible optical transitions of a hole at the bottom of the band . ]    using the photoemission matrix elements ( [ pesmat ] ) the photoemission spectrum can be calculated , see figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "in addition to the familiar quasiparticle band discovered in sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 by wells _ at al._@xcite , which has been discussed extensively in the literature@xcite there is a second band with slightly lower intensity which has predominant @xmath49-like sp character and runs essentially parallel to the original band .",
    "indeed such a second band with weaker intensity which follows the main band is seen in exact diagonalization of small clusters - see e.g. figure 1 of ref @xcite .",
    "these higher lying sp bands have small spectral weight and therefore could be hard to observe in arpes - even more so because the arpes spectra in the undoped compound are likely to show strong lattice polaronic effects@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it may be that a higher lying band - possibly the first @xmath49-like band - has been observed by ronning _",
    "et al . _ in the insulating cuprate ca@xmath2cu0@xmath2cl@xmath2@xcite .",
    "there a second weak band has been observed at roughly @xmath118 below the quasiparticle band .",
    "ronning _ et al .",
    "_ interpreted this as part of a wide band which reaches @xmath0 at a binding energy below @xmath119 . as can be seen in figure [ fig5 ] , however , this band ( triangles ) has a dispersion that is quite comparable to that of the quasiparticle band ( circles ) .",
    "moreover , as will be discussed below , we believe that the band portion observed in ca@xmath2cu0@xmath2cl@xmath2 around @xmath0 at binding energies around @xmath119 is an example of a ` 1ev peak ' as observed in sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2@xcite and thus unrelated to the band marked by triangles . while the higher lying bands may be hard to observe in arpes optical interband transitions between the main band and these higher lying bands produce finite - frequency optical conductivity which may correspond to the mid ir bands - again in the actual compounds this may be complicated by polaronic effects .",
    "photoemission spectrum for the half - filled model corresponding to the band structure ( [ fig5 ] ) . in the left panel",
    "the spectral weight is computed using only the quantum fluctuation correction ( [ pesmat ] ) , in the right panel the charge - fluctuation correction ( [ pesmat1 ] ) was used as well . ]",
    "another feature which can be seen in figure [ fig6 ] and which is quite consistent with experiment is the sharp drop of the spectral weight of the quasiparticle band which occurs whenever one passes ( roughly ) through the fermi surface of the noninteracting half - filled .",
    "i.e. the remnant fermi surface .",
    "it is caused by the @xmath3-dependence of the photoemission matrix elements ( [ pesmat ] ) and ( [ pesmat1 ] ) and therefore reflects the interplay of spin and charge fluctuations in the spin background and the internal structure of the quasiparticle .",
    "assuming that the structure of the quasiparticles remains roughly the same in a spin background without long range order but short ranged antiferromagnetic correlations - as is suggested by exact diagonalization@xcite - the @xmath3-dependence of the photoemission matrix element should be similar for finite doping .",
    "this would provide an immediate explanation for the ` fermi arcs ' seen in the underdoped compounds . to make this more quantitative",
    "we have computed the fermi contour by filling up the single hole dispersion according to the pauli principle - see figure [ fig5 ] - and showed it in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the lower panel shows the spectral weight of the quasiparticle band as a function of the fermi surface angle .",
    "the hole pocket is actually more elongated along the ( 1,1 ) direction than along the antiferromagnetic zone boundary .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this is calculated at half - filling where @xmath120 is far from the valence band top due to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms - see figure [ fig5 ] . on the other hand",
    "it is known that upon doping the band portions near @xmath120 move upward@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that decreasing antiferromagnetic spin correlations lead to an effective downward renormalization of @xmath6 and @xmath7 with doping@xcite so that for finite doping the pocket is probably elongated more along the antiferromagnetic zone boundary as observed by chang _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this effect can not be reproduced by our simple theory , however .",

    "bottom : spectral weight of the corresponding sp - band along the fermi surface as a function of the angle @xmath63 . ]",
    "another phenomenon which would find a very simple explanation in an approximate rigid band behaviour upon doping is the pseudogap@xcite .",
    "the upper part of figure [ fig8 ] shows again the hole pocket and a contour in @xmath3-space which extends the ` front part ' of the pocket into a free - electron - like fermi surface .",
    "the pseudogap is usually defined by measuring the leading edge shift or the dispersion of the high - energy feature along such a contour .",
    "the lower part of figure [ fig8 ] then shows the energy of the quasiparticle band along this ` fermi surface ' plotted versus the fermi surface angle @xmath122 .",
    "there is the characteristic flat part near @xmath123 which originates because the contour initially follows the hole pocket and then the d - wave - like downward dispersion as the free - electron - like fermi surface departs from the hole pocket .",
    "it should be noted that this would explain only the high - energy pseudogap . on the other hand the low - energy pseudogap ,",
    "being defined in terms of a leading - edge shift , has no immediate connection with a dispersion relation and will almost certainly depend also on the temperature and momentum dependent linewidth of the quasiparticle band@xcite .",
    "in fact , assuming a lifetime broadening @xmath124 would immediately explain also the low - energy pseudogap . as noted above the pocket in figure [ fig8 ]",
    "is too much elongated in @xmath125-direction .",
    "howvere , the effective downward renormalization of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the doped compounds would lead to a pocket that is more elongated along the magnetic zone boundary . in any way , however , if one would go along the inner part of the pocket near @xmath125 and extend this to a free - electron - like fermi surface as in the top part of figure [ fig8 ] one will always see a dispersion as shown in the bottom part of figure [ fig8 ] .",

    "finally we want to discuss the spectral function on a larger energy scale . to keep the discussion simple we keep only @xmath46-like sp states in ( [ lcao_like ] ) but include excited",
    "@xmath46-like states with @xmath126 ( extending this to @xmath127 produces no visible change in the spectra - this is one of the beneficial effects of the ` prediagonalization ' of @xmath25 ) .",
    "moreover we retain only the matrix elements due to string truncation and the @xmath6 and @xmath7-terms , i.e. processes of the type shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",

    "in addition to the quasiparticle band - which is essentially identical to the one of the more exact calculation shown in figure [ fig6 ] above - there now appear additional bands at higher energy . in reality",
    "these ` bands ' probably are not well - defined states because they are already high in energy .",
    "rather these states are probably strongly broadened due to interaction with magnons and phonons and may have only the character of ` resonances ' . whereas the quasiparticle band is composed mainly of the lowest @xmath46-like sp states for motion of the hole trapped in the linearly ascending potential the higher lying bands correspond to excited levels of the trapped hole .",
    "the relatively high intensity of these states may be understood by noting that the coefficients @xmath128 for the excited states @xmath129 will have extra nodes as functions of @xmath34 and if the signs of the @xmath128 better match the prefactors in ( [ pesmat ] ) the matrix element may even be larger for these higher lying states .",

    "it should be also noted that the spectral weight shown in figure [ fig9 ] can not directly be compared with ref .",
    "@xcite because we are taking into account the corrections of the arpes matrix element due to quantum spin fluctuations in the half - filled gound state which are not included there .",

    "_ found@xcite that in the insulating cuprate ca@xmath2cu0@xmath2cl@xmath2 the quasiparticle band seem to ` fade away ' as the @xmath0-point is approached - a phenomenon which is common to all cuprates .",
    "the spectral weight that is missing from the quasiparticle band then appears at @xmath132 below the maximum of the quasiparticle band in the form a high intensity band which has a dispersion that is remarkably consistent with lda band structure calculations .",
    "more precisely this is the antibonding band of @xmath133 and @xmath134 orbitals - whereby it has to be kept in mind that at @xmath0 these two orbitals do not hybridize due to partity , so that in an lcao - like description these bands have pure oxygen character at @xmath0 and - by continuity in @xmath3 - very small @xmath135 admixture its neighborhood .",
    "similar behaviour was observed in doped cuprates as well@xcite . in addition , the so - called waterfall - phenomenon is observed . moving e.g. along the @xmath125 direction towards @xmath0",
    "the quasiparticle band first disperses away from the fermi edge but then - at a momentum of approximately @xmath136 - seems to bend down sharply and drop almost vertically down to an energy of @xmath137 below the fermi edge .",
    "the apparent vertical part of the dispersion - the ` waterfalls ' - can be seen as a hump in momentum distribution curves at binding energies in the range of @xmath138 upon reaching @xmath137 below @xmath139 the vertical parts then merge with two lda - like bands of high intensity .",
    "similar behaviour - namely small band portions with a free electron - like dispersion and high spectral weight near high symmetry points of the brillouin zone - has been observed previously in the insulating compound sr@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 by pothuizen _ at al._@xcite .",
    "the interpretation given by these authors was that these are o2p derived states which do not hybridize with cu3d orbitals due to symmetry - which is why they appear only at high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone - and hence are unaffected by the strong correlations in the partially filled cu3d orbitals .",
    "this explains their lda - like dispersion and high spectral weight because they are essentially free electron states .",
    "we believe that an important clue to the interpretation of the waterfalls is the finding of inosov _ et al . _ who showed that matrix element effects play a crucial role in their observation@xcite and that the missing part of the quasiparticle band near @xmath0 can in fact be observed with photon energies around @xmath140 where the cross section for @xmath135 orbitals becomes appreciable@xcite",
    ". moreover , pan _ at al .",
    "_ found that the waterfalls show the same dependence on photon polarization as the quasiparticle band itself , indicating that they also are derived from zhang - rice singlets@xcite . and",
    "finally in our opinion the crucial clue is the fact , that the quasiparticle band itself can not be observed near the @xmath0-point either . while numerical studies of the hubbard and t - j model@xcite - as well as the present theory - do indeed predict that the spectral weight of this band is lower by a factor of 2 - 3 at @xmath0 as compared to @xmath4 , in experiment there is practically no more intensity visible",
    "rather , the spectra show a complete suppression of spectral weight around @xmath0 which extends down to the intense lda - like bands . most significantly , however , the waterfalls appear at very nearly the same momentum where the quasiparticle band itself becomes visible .",
    "we conclude that the reason for the vanishing of the quasiparticle band near @xmath0 is ` extrinsic ' to the t - j or single - band hubbard model namely the special combination of phases for the @xmath134 orbitals in the bonding combination which hybridizes with a given @xmath133 orbital in the zhang - rice singlet ( zrs ) . in the framework of a simple three - step model of photoemission for photoemission",
    "the effect that we seek comes from the matrix element for the dipole transition from o2p states into the final state - which we take to be a plane wave with momentum @xmath3 for simplicity .",

    "the matrix element for a dipole transition from the bonding combination of o2p@xmath146 oxygen orbitals around a given cu site @xmath75 @xmath147 into the plane wave state is @xmath148 \\cdot { \\bf \\epsilon}. \\label{zhangdip}\\ ] ] note that the @xmath3 dependence of the expression in square brackets comes solely from the interplay between the phase factors @xmath149 on the four oxygen neighbors of atom @xmath75 and the relative phases of the orbitals in ( [ zrphases ] ) .",
    "namely any two oxygen orbitals whose position in real space differ by one lattice spacing have a relative phase of @xmath150 in the zrs - which would correspond to momentum @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath3 dependence is therefore completely independent of details in the computation of the matrix elements @xmath151 and therefore in particular independent of the photon polarization .",
    "moreover it would stay the same if a more realistic final state wave function were used as long as this is a bloch state with momentum @xmath3 .",
    "it now can be seen that @xmath152 as @xmath153 . unlike the argument based on the dipole selection rule which was discussed by ronning _",
    "et al._@xcite the expression ( [ zhangdip ] ) thus explains why the quasiparticle band has vanishing intensity not only at @xmath0 but at all equivalent points in higher brillouin zones as well .",
    "the above considerations apply only to hole creation on oxygen . for photon energies around @xmath154",
    "is is well known , however , that the cross section for hole creation on oxygen is considerably larger than for hole creation in transition metal @xmath155 orbitals@xcite .",
    "moreover , starting from a @xmath156 state one would reach a @xmath157 state .",
    "the latter is high in energy and hence has small weight in the zrs and moreover the resulting spectral weight would be spread over several ev due to the multiplet splitting of @xmath157 so that the corresponding matrix element certainly is small .",
    "a @xmath156 final state could be produced by photoemission from @xmath158 state but this state also is high in energy and therefore has small weight in the ground state . in any way the contribution of hole creation on cu is strongly suppressed . for larger photon energies - around @xmath140 - inosov _ at al",
    "_ could indeed resolve the quasiparticle band@xcite but only at @xmath159 .",
    "obviously the larger photoemission cross section and the non - validity of the dipole selection rule at this momentum make it possible to see intensity from photo holes in @xmath133 orbitals .",
    "clear evidence that the intensity seen there is due to photohole creation on cu is also provided by the strong variation of intensity around the @xmath160 threshold which is being used routinely to identify transition metal @xmath155 states in other transition metal oxides@xcite .",
    "one might then ask , where the spectral weight corresponding to hole creation on oxygen goes at @xmath0 .",
    "the answer is that this spectral weight is concentrated in the lda - like bands which are observed around the @xmath0-point at approximately @xmath161 below the fermi energy . due to parity",
    "the ` antibonding band ' of @xmath133 and @xmath134 orbitals actually has pure oxygen character at @xmath0 .",
    "if a bloch state of @xmath162 orbitals is created with momentum @xmath131 this can not couple to the zrs singlet - see ( [ zhangdip ] ) - but has overlap @xmath79 with these bandlike states .",

    "the t - j bands become visible but lose spectral weight as well ( dashed potions ) .",
    "the nearly free - electron states cease to exist because they now have appreciable hybridization with the correlated cu d - orbitals .",
    "the higher lying sp bands thus are visible only in a small window in @xmath3-space i.e. the waterfalls . ]",
    "these leaves the question as to what is the interpretation of the waterfalls .",
    "the above considerations suggest that these are simply the higher lying sp bands seen in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "these bands are likely to be strongly broadened due to interaction with spin excitations and possible also phonons although one of them may have been resolved by ronning _ et al._@xcite ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "near @xmath0 the spectral weight of these bands disappears because they are also ` t - j - derived ' and the matrix element for creation of a zrs vanishes see figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "as one moves away from @xmath0 the matrix element for creation of a zrs increases but - as can be seen in figure [ fig9 ] - the spectral weight of these excited sp bands now quickly decreases .",
    "it follows that the spectral weight of these bands must go through a maximum as one moves away from @xmath0 and this is our interpretation of the ` waterfalls ' : a number of essentially incoherent states which have a ` window of visibility ' in a narrow range of momenta around @xmath136 and this window of visibility is seen as the hump in the momentum distribution curves . since the suppression of these states near @xmath0",
    "is governed by the same matrix element of the zrs as the quasiparticle band itself , it is moreover clear that this window of visibility ` opens ' precisely in the same range of @xmath3 where the quasiparticle band itself becomes visible - hence the apparent downward bending and the waterfall - like appearance of the spectra .    a more quantitative description of this phenomenon",
    "obviously would have to start out from a three - band model so as to describe both , the coupling of a photohole to a zrs and the existence of the nearly free electron states at high - symmetry points .",
    "this is out of the scope of the present paper and we therefore make no attempt for a quantitative discussion .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to explain the waterfall phenomenon within the t - j model@xcite .",
    "however , as was already noted , the experimental spectra show a complete suppression of spectral weight around @xmath0 which extends downward all the way to the intense lda - like bands .",
    "this behaviour is not reproduced by t - j model calculations which show spectral weight - corresponding to the higher lying bands in figure [ fig9 ] - at too low binding energy . moreover ,",
    "the lda - like dispersion of the high - intensity parts near @xmath0 is not really reproduced",
    "finally we turn to a discussion of the optical conductivity thereby using the results of the simplified calculation which took into account only the lowest @xmath163 state for each symmetry @xmath60 .",
    "as is the case for atomic wave functions the @xmath46 and @xmath164-like sp states on one hand and the @xmath49-like sp states on the other have opposite parity and hence can have nonvanishing matrix elements of the current operator in between them . if we assume again that the quasiparticle band is filled with holes upon doping - which would occupy momenta around @xmath4 - we thus expect optical interband transitions ( as indicated in figure [ fig5 ] ) which should be observable in the finite frequency optical response .",
    "this is defined as @xmath165 where @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) denotes the n - th eigenstate ( eigenenergy ) of the system ( in particular , @xmath168 denotes the ground state ) .",

    "are shown in figure [ fig11 ] . starting from a bare hole - the ` string of length 0 ' -     application of the current operator @xmath176 to a bare hole in the nel state ( a ) creates two strings of length @xmath79 ( b ) and ( c ) with opposite signs . ]",
    "the current operator @xmath176 generates two strings of length @xmath79 but with opposite sign .",
    "these two string states thus have precisely the right sign to couple to a @xmath59-like sp state , see the sign convention in figure [ fig2 ] . from this and similar processes we obtain the matrix element @xmath177",
    "all matrix elements generated in a similar way and involving sps of different symmetries or hopping at longer distances have been listed in the appendix [ appb ] .",
    "the resulting optical conductivity at a hole concentration of 10 % is shown in figure [ fig12 ] .     optical conductivity at 10 % hole concentration .",
    "]    while the higher lying bands with @xmath49-character have small spectral weight and hence are difficult to observe in arpes , they dominate the optical conductivity .",
    "we note that the present interpretation of the optical conductivity is consistent with that of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "one may expect that the excited levels of the trapped hole - or ` internal degrees of freedom ' of the sp quasiparticles - are also seen in the dynamical density correlation function .",
    "vojta and becker@xcite have calculated the dynamical density correlation function in a string framework similar to the one used by bonce _ at al . _ and obtained convincing agreement with exact diagonalization results . within our approach",
    "one can naturally explain the distribution and spreading of the spectral intensity over a wide energy range , which has been observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "due to the brillouin folding in the af state the center of the hole pocket at @xmath178 is a high symmetry point .",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath164 , and @xmath49 sp states do not mix with each other exactly at this point .",
    "thus , the transitions with similar intensity occur in the weakly doped system between the lowest predominantly @xmath46-like and the first and the third predominantly @xmath49-like bands .",
    "wider spreading of the high intensity region at higher energies can be attributed to the admixture of @xmath49-wave sps to the lowest band and transition to the predominantly @xmath164-wave second excited band .",
    "in summary we have presented a theory for spin polaron - like quasiparticles .",
    "the basic idea is that a hole in an antiferromagnetically ordered ` spin background ' is self - trapped which actually requires only short - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this will lead to a hierarchy of localized states which may also realize different irreducible representations of @xmath37 .",
    "since the heisenberg exchange and the @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms have matrix elements between such self - trapped states on neighboring sites an lcao - like description emerges where the role of the atomic or wannier functions is played by the levels of the self - trapped hole .",
    "this leads to a multi band structure for the doped holes with the lowest of these being the familiar quasiparticle band observed in the insulating compounds and discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "here we take the point of view that the simplest description for the underdoped compounds is holes being filled into this quasiparticle band .",
    "the fact that these self - trapped states extend over several unit cells in real space necessarily implies that they have an arpes form factor which varies within the first brillouin zone - hence the strong variation of the photoemission intensity of the quasiparticle band as a function of @xmath3 which explains the remnant fermi surface and the fermi arcs seen in arpes .",
    "moreover , the pseudogap becomes a triviality within this picture .",
    "one of the higher bands of the effective lcao - hamiltonian may have been observed in arpes in the insulator ca@xmath2cuo@xmath2cl@xmath2 and optical transitions between the resulting bands may explain the mid - infrared band in optical spectroscopy .",
    "there are probably complications due to lattice polaron effects but here we neglect these although the simplicity of the present calculation - which never need matrices to more than @xmath89 - would certainly allow to treat such effects as well .",
    "the main drawback of the present theory is the use of a spin background with antiferromagnetic order - which clearly is not realized in doped materials of interest . on the other hand all processes by which the hole propagates involve only spins in its immediate neighborhood .",
    "one may therefore expect that very similar processes would occur in a spin background with only short range antiferromagnetic correlations so that much of the present theory should apply in this case as well .",
    "the most important effect we are missing with the present calculation is the closing of the pseudogap with both increasing temperature and increasing doping . since this closing implies that the dispersion actually approaches that for the ` pure ' t - j model - i.e. without @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms - this effect could be described by an effective downward renormalization of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms .",
    "the mechanism may be the decrease of spin correlations : in the nel state the @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms can transport a hole ` completely coherent ' i.e. without creating a spin excitation .",
    "as the spin correlation length decreases and reaches the ` range ' of these terms in real space - two lattice spacings - the @xmath6 and @xmath7 will increasingly generate spin excitations when transporting a hole so that they change their net effect from coherent hole transport to ` excitation generating ' hole transport .",

    "the nn hopping operator , by shifting the hole at the end of the string depicted in fig . [ fig14 ] ( d ) from site @xmath216 to site @xmath75 , generates the string state depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig14 ] ( d ) represents a string state in which flipped spins occupy sites @xmath75 , @xmath217 , @xmath28 , and the hole occupy site @xmath216 .",
    "it is clear that the same mechanism generates the hopping of sps between all second nn sites .",
    "depending on the symmetry of the initial and final sp states , related hopping integrals are given by @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 , and @xmath222 .",
    "the analysis of hamiltonian terms induced by the exchange interaction can be performed along similar lines .",
    "we start with a necessary correction to the ising part of the exchange energy .",
    "when we have been constructing the schrdinger equation ( [ schr1])-([schr3 ] ) for wavefunctions ( [ wvfn ] ) of sps , we have assumed that the ising contribution depends on the length of strings , but does not depend on their geometry .",
    "that assumption is true for short strings , but for longer strings there exists some exceptions from that rule .",
    "for example , by inspecting the spin structure of the string state depicted fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ( d ) , we see that one broken bond has been saved for that state in comparison with strings which have the same length and have the starting and ending points which are not nns .",
    "that fact gives rise to the decrease by @xmath27 of the string - state energy and to corrections to eigenenergies of @xmath164-wave and @xmath49-wave sps .",
    "those corrections are given by @xmath223 and @xmath224 respectively .",
    "since the amendments are related to strings of length at least 3 lattice spacings we neglect them in the case of the @xmath46-wave sp because the weight of related string states in the wavefunction of the s - wave sp is small .",
    "also the best known in literature process which determines to great extent the overall shape of the single - particle energy - dispersion at the low energy scale gives rise to the hybridization between sps with different symmetries .",
    "that process has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .     ( a ) and ( b ) a low - order process which involves the action of the transverse part of the exchange term and gives rise to the hybridization of sps with different symmetry .",

    "[ fig15 ] ( a ) by the transverse part of the exchange energy gives rise to the string state depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( b ) and to the hybridization between sps at sites @xmath28 and @xmath40 . in that kind of hybridization",
    "the @xmath46-wave state should be involved because the state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( a ) represents a bare hole created in the nel state . as we have shown before , such string states do not contribute to wavefunctions of sps with lower symmetry .",
    "the hopping integrals which appear at terms coupling an @xmath46-wave sp with an @xmath46-wave , a @xmath164-wave , and a @xmath49-wave sp located at a third nn site are given by @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 respectively .",
    "a similar mechanism gives rise to a correction to the eigenenergy of a @xmath164-wave sp . the action of the xy term flips spins in the string state depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig15 ] ( d ) . due to the fact that both string states contribute to the wavefunctions",
    "( [ wvfn ] ) of sps created at the same site @xmath28 and due to standard selection rules , the contribution to @xmath228 originating with the above discussed process must be diagonal .",
    "for this reason , @xmath49-wave states can not contribute to the related new matrix elements @xmath213 , because the process depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( c ) , ( d ) involves string states which contribute to different @xmath58-wave and @xmath59-wave sps . since the length of the string depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( d ) is 3 lattice spacings we neglect the correction to the eigenenergy of the @xmath46-wave sp , because we expect that it is small .",
    "the correction to the eigenenergy of the @xmath164-wave sp is @xmath229 .",

    "the overlap between sps is rather small because it originates with the overlap of nominally different string states related with paths of relatively long length .",
    "such string states have been depicted in fig .",

    "the generated in this way overlap between different sps also gives rise to a new contribution in the hamilton operator , @xmath230    the analysis of other processes which give rise to new elements of @xmath228 is rather straightforward and similar to the analysis of previously discussed processes .",
