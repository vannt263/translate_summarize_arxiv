    "the dark matter clusters on large scales , and helps seed structure formation in the universe . while the identity of the dark matter particle , or particles , is unknown , we do know several of its properties : it must be massive , non - relativistic ( cold or warm ) , electric and color neutral , and stable at least on cosmic time - scales .    of all the fundamental particles in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ,",
    "only the neutrinos come close to having these properties .",
    "however , neutrinos are exceedingly light and engage in weak interactions : relic neutrinos would move at highly relativistic velocities , and so could nt clump enough to seed structure formation .",
    "their measured abundance from wmap analyses is only a tiny fraction of the universe s energy budget .",
    "thus , the existence of dark matter is also evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "while there exist a plethora of candidate dm particles from bsm theories ( examples include black hole remnants , q - balls , sterile neutrinos , axions , kk gravitons , gravitinos , neutralinos , kk photons , branons and the lightest @xmath1-parity odd particle of little higgs theories .",
    "two of these stand out in that they arise naturally due to very elegant solutions to long - standing problems in particle physics .",
    "these include the _ axion _ , which arises from the peccei - quinn ( pq ) solution to the strong cp problem of qcd@xcite , and the _ lightest supersymmetric particle _ , or lsp , of @xmath2-parity conserving supersymmetric ( susy ) theories@xcite .",
    "the susy theories solve the problematic quadratic divergences associated with scalar fields by introducing a new symmetry which relates bosons to fermions , thus giving scalar fields the milder divergence structure which is held by chiral fermions and gauge fields .",
    "susy also provides a means to unification with gravity , is an essential part of superstring theory , and in concert with grand unified theories ( guts ) , receives some experimental support in the unification of gauge couplings under mssm renormalization group evolution .",
    "in fact , the pq strong cp solution and supersymmetry are in many ways made for each other , so these two schemes are not mutually exclusive , and both may well be right . in that case , the axion occurs as part of an axion supermultiplet , which contains along with the axion an @xmath2-parity odd _ axino _ @xmath3 , which may serve as lsp . in susy theories , the neutralino , the gravitino and the axino are all possible lsp candidates . in this talk",
    ", i will restrict my comments to supersymmetric dark matter ( which includes axions and axinos ) , and comment on how it relates to lhc physics .",
    "in susy theories with neutralino cdm , the @xmath4 is considered a natural wimp candidate for dark matter .",
    "the neutralino relic density can be calculated by solving the boltzmann equation as formulated for a frw universe .",
    "central to the calculation is computation of the thermally averaged neutralino annihilation ( and co - annihilation ) cross section .",
    "the fact that the relic density comes out approximately in the right ball - park is often referred to as the `` wimp miracle '' .    the paradigm model for susy phenomenology",
    "is called minimal supergravity ( msugra ) or cmssm .",
    "it is defined by just a few parameters : @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the msugra model ,",
    "the wimp miracle is actually no miracle at all !",
    "the relic density turns out to be much too large over most parameter space .",
    "in fact , only in regions where the neutralino annihilation rate is highly enhanced will the relic density match the measured value .",
    "these regions are termed : the stau co - annihilation region at low @xmath7 , the hb / fp region at large @xmath7 where @xmath8 becomes small and we get mixed bino - higgsino cdm , the @xmath9-resonance region at large @xmath10 where @xmath11 annihilation through the @xmath9- resonance is enhanced , and the ( largely excluded ) bulk region , where annihilation is through @xmath12-channel exchange of light sleptons .",
    "direct production of wimp dark matter at lhc ( _ e.g. _ @xmath13 ) is usually not interesting since there is no hard energy deposition for detectors to trigger upon .",
    "however , if susy exists , then lhc may be able to produce many or all of the _ other _ susy particles .",
    "the susy particle s subsequent cascade decays@xcite should lead to collider events with high @xmath14 jets , high @xmath14 isolated @xmath15s and @xmath8s . since each sparticle cascade decay terminates at the lsp ( the putative dm particle ) , the susy events should also contain large missing transverse energy ( @xmath16 ) due to non - detection of the dm particles .    at each point in msugra ( or any other susy model ) parameter space , we can simulate lhc production of the entire array of superparticles , along with their cascade decays@xcite . by looking for signals with high @xmath14 jets , isolated leptons and @xmath16 beyond levels expected in the sm we can test if a signal can be seen for an assumed value of integrated luminosity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sug]@xcite , such a calculation has been made assuming 100 fb@xmath17 of integrated luminosity .",
    "lhc should be able to see the parameter space below the contour marked `` lhc '' , which corresponds to @xmath18 tev when @xmath19 , or @xmath20 tev when @xmath21 .",
    "we also show contours of direct wimp detection rates and indirect wimp detection rates via high energy neutrino detection at icecube , or via detection of @xmath22s , @xmath23s or @xmath24s arising from neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is noteworthy than in the dm - favored hb / fp region at large @xmath7 , the lhc can only cover a portion of allowed parameter space .",
    "however , in this region , direct detection via xenon-100 or indirect detection via icecube is likely . in the @xmath9-annihilation",
    "region the large bump in the center of the plot detection of halo annihilations via @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is enhanced@xcite .",
    "the enhancement of dd and idd in the higgsino - like region is a general feature of a large assortment of models going beyond msugra . in fig . [",
    "fig : dd ] , we show predicted rates in models with a _ well - tempered _ neutralino@xcite . the large cluster of models around @xmath25 pb shows that the next set of dd experiments can either discover or rule out an entire class of well - motivated susy models@xcite .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "a potential pit - fall in the msugra model is known as the gravitino problem .",
    "if we assume a sugra - type model , with a tev scale gravitino @xmath26 , then gravitinos can be produced thermally in the early universe ( even though they are never in thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "if the @xmath26 is not the lsp , then it will decay into particle - sparticle pairs , and the sparticle cascade decays will contribute additional lsps to the relic density .",
    "the relic density is too much if the re - heat temperature @xmath27 gev .",
    "even if @xmath28 is lower , the late - time gravitino decays inject high energy particles into the cosmic soup during or after bbn , which can destroy the successful bbn predictions which match so well with data .",
    "detailed calculations@xcite show that one needs @xmath29 gev ( which conflicts with many baryogenesis mechanisms ) or @xmath30 gev as long as @xmath31 tev ( the large @xmath32 suppresses the gravitino lifetime to less than 1 sec , so @xmath33 decays occur at the onset or even before bbn starts ) . since in sugra models",
    "the gravitino mass sets the scale for all the ssb terms , then we would naively expect all the susy particles to be at masses @xmath34 tev ( beyond lhc reach ) .",
    "one way out might be to assume the gravitino is the lsp . but this results in the gravitino problem in reverse",
    ". then neutralinos or other sparticles in the early universe would decay with long lifetimes in particle - gravitino pairs , and again disrupt bbn .",
    "detailed calculations@xcite show that @xmath32 should be @xmath35 gev for @xmath36 gev .",
    "since @xmath32 sets the scale for the other sparticle , we would expect all the sparticles to have mass @xmath35 gev , in contradiction to experimental limits .",
    "another possibility is to assume some form of pq solution to the strong cp problem . in the sugra context",
    ", we will add an axion supermultiplet to the model , which also contains an @xmath2-odd spin @xmath37 axino @xmath3@xcite .",
    "then , axions will be produced as usual via vacuum mis - alignment@xcite , and can contribute to the relic density .",
    "their relic abundance depends on the pq breaking scale @xmath38 , or alternatively on @xmath39 . a value of @xmath40 gev , corresponding to @xmath41 ev",
    ", would saturate the measured dm abundance .",
    "the value of the axino mass @xmath42 is very model - dependent : estimates range from the mev to the multi - gev scale@xcite . in msugra , if @xmath3 is the lsp , then @xmath43 can occur with a lifetime of order a fraction of a second : it is then bbn - safe .",
    "the @xmath3 can also be produced thermally like the gravitino@xcite .",
    "its thermal abundance depends on @xmath38 , @xmath42 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , dm would have three components : cold axions , cold axinos from thermal production and warm axinos from neutralino decay .",
    "the scenario works well if @xmath44 the mev scale .",
    "then , we find the msugra model can have dominant axion cdm with a small mixture of warm and cold axinos@xcite . the resulting value of @xmath28 is plotted in msugra space in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr ] .",
    "the regions of msugra space that are most neutralino dis - favored lead to the highest values of @xmath45 gev .",
    "this is enough to sustain non - thermal or affleck - dine leptogenesis !",
    "thus , the most dis - favored neutralino dm regions are precisely the _ most favored _ axion / axino regions ! also , consequently , we expect quite different collider signatures at lhc in the case of mixed axion / axino cdm , as compared to neutralino dm .",
    "we remark here that calculating the amount of fine - tuning of the neutralino relic abundance also shows a preference for mixed axion / axino cdm over neutralino cdm@xcite .",

    "susy gut models based on the gauge group @xmath0 are extremely compelling , since these models allow for matter unification into the 16 dimensional spinor of @xmath0 , give rise naturally to see - saw neutrinos , and yield automatic cancellation of triangle anomalies@xcite .",
    "the simplest @xmath0 susy gut models also contain @xmath47 _ yukawa coupling unification_. scans over susy model parameter space reveal that yukawa unification only occurs for a very specific spectra : first / second generation scalars at the 10 tev level , third gen . scalars and higgs at the tev scale , while gauginos are quite light , with @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 gev@xcite .",
    "the neutralino relic abundance turns out to be much too high : @xmath50 , about 4 - 5 orders of magnitude too much .",
    "the problem can be solved by invoking mixed axion / axino cdm@xcite .",
    "then , @xmath43 decays reduce the relic abundance by factors of @xmath51 .",
    "the scenario works best if the cdm is mainly axions , with a small admixture of thermal and non - thermal axinos@xcite .",
    "values of @xmath52 are possible , allowing for baryogenesis . and since @xmath53 tev , we also expect @xmath54 tev , thus solving the gravitino problem !    in this model , the light gluinos lead to robust signatures at both the tevatron@xcite and lhc colliders@xcite , and the whole scenario should be largely tested within year 1 of lhc operation , or even sooner if a tevatron analysis is performed .",
