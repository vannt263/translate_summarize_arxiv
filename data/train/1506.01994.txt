    "there is increasing evidence of a fundamental connection between the phenomenology of unconventional superconductivity and the proliferation of broken symmetry phases in hole - doped cuprates@xcite .",
    "on one hand , numerous studies indicate the existence of electronic phases that break translational symmetry , viz .",
    "spin / charge density waves@xcite and stripes@xcite , and are expected to compete with or enhance superconductivity . on the other , several reports of the onset of broken time - reversal and point - group symmetries",
    "have recently emerged@xcite , complicating the picture .",
    "a case in point is the prototypical cuprate la@xmath0ba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , wherein the spin and charge of the doped holes together form a @xmath6-periodic static stripe arrangement@xcite strongest at @xmath3  where bulk superconductivity is strongly suppressed@xcite .",
    "recent reports suggest that striped lbco may also host other broken symmetries , with potential ramifications on the extensively debated superconducting mechanism in these materials@xcite .",
    "a set of recent studies on @xmath7lbco have challenged the notion that its phase diagram is well understood .",
    "first , a recent transport study by li _ _ et al.__@xcite has detected a finite nernst effect signal _ at zero magnetic field _",
    "well above @xmath4 , interpreted as evidence of spontaneous vortex generation due to time - reversal symmetry breaking ( trsb ) .",
    "this was corroborated by polar kerr effect measurements of karapetyan _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "however , subsequent theoretical work showed that these observations could also be consistent with a non - trivial point - group symmetry breaking ( psb ) induced by stripe charge order@xcite , wherein the stacking of stripes in the @xmath8 plane can be modulated in a nontrivial fashion along the @xmath9axis to break inversion and mirror symmetries .",
    "it is worth noting that the onset of stripe order plays central role in both scenarios  the trsb is driven by the onset of superconducting correlations along individual stripes , whereas the psb is ascribed to the long - range ordering of stripes .",
    "several prior observations such as that of a pairing gap and resistivity drop above @xmath10@xcite support the presence of superconducting correlations , corroborating the trsb picture .",
    "meanwhile , some predictions ensuing from psb dealing with the varation of kerr angle with crystal orientation have also been verified@xcite ; however this interpretation remains a subject of controversy@xcite .",
    "importantly , neither scenario provides a fully satisfactory explanation of recent experiments  the sign of the trsb signal can not be `` trained '' by external magnetic fields , while psb can not explain the nernst effect profile , observed to peak near the onset of superconductivity@xcite .    here",
    "we perform a high - resolution thermoelectric investigation of near-@xmath11 lbco , and use the doping and field dependence of the observed features to delineate their behavior and understand their origin .",

    "the large resistivity anisotropy in lbco ( @xmath34 , @xcite ) severely limits attempts to detect their presence using anomalous hall effect  due to unavoidable artifacts resulting from @xmath35-axis pickup@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the near - isotropic thermoelectric properties of lbco@xcite enable the field - symmetric nernst coefficient , @xmath36 , to probe their signatures with the requisite sensitivity",
    ". having determined the characteristic temperature scales of stripe and superconducting phases for our samples , we thus turn to the nernst effect measurements forming the nucleus of this work .",
    "the nernst coefficient , @xmath37 corresponds to the transverse voltage @xmath38 generated due to a longitudinal thermal gradient @xmath39 .",
    "it is typically observed at a finite magnetic field , and in the cuprates , has been attributed to moving vortices@xcite , gaussian fluctuations@xcite , or to quasiparticles arising from fluctuating stripes@xcite . while the aforementioned _ field anti - symmetric _ , or conventional nernst coefficient is determined entirely from transverse thermoelectric measurements at fields @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) ,",
    "this is not possible for the the _ field - symmetric _ , unconventional component of interest to us ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "for example , at zero field , the observed signal ( @xmath27 ) unavoidably contains a longitudinal @xmath43 pickup due to a slight misalignment of the contact leads ( [ fig : zfn_summary]b ) .",
    "therefore , we obtain the true zero field nernst ( zfn ) coefficient @xmath30 ( and , by extension , @xmath44 at finite fields ) by removing the @xmath43 contribution to @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath45@xcite , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are measured simultaneously ( schematic in [ fig : zfn_summary]a , further details in @xcite ) .",
    "the zfn coefficient @xmath30 measured as a function of temperature using this compensated technique for @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively ( [ fig : zfn_summary]c - d ) shows several features at characteristic transition temperatures that are consistent across doping .",
    "first , @xmath30 is finite only for @xmath46 , i.e. in the presence of static stripes , yet in the absence of bulk superconductivity , as reported for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "second , @xmath30 can be bipolar ( [ fig : zfn_summary]d ) in contrast with @xcite , and the exact behavior is reproduced through multiple temperature cycles .",
    "third , we observe a broad hump ( width @xmath48  k ) just above @xmath25 - similar to that reported in @xcite , which has been ascribed to spontaneous vortex generation .",
    "fourth , and crucially , we observe a * _ sharp peak _ * ( width @xmath49  k ) at a temperature previously identified as @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath5 peak , also visible in the raw data ( [ fig : zfn_summary]b ) has been hitherto unobserved likely due to its sharp linewidth ; our high temperature resolution ( @xmath50  k ) and small temperature gradients ( @xmath51  k / mm ) enable its detection .",
    "we reiterate that such a sharp peak is in contrast to a broad hump expected from the presence of vortices@xcite .",
    "importantly , its coincidence with the onset of stripe charge order ( @xmath5 ) is suggestive of its origin .    * _ symmetric nernst effect : field dependence _ *     at various magnetic fields for * ( a ) * @xmath13 and * ( b ) * @xmath14 .",
    "the sharp @xmath52 feature is field - invariant , while the lower temperature feature is strongly suppressed by magnetic field .",
    "[ fig : bnernst],width=192 ]    having identified features of interest in the zfn data , we now turn to the field - symmetric evolution of these data ( @xmath53 , shown in [ fig : bnernst ] ) , to further understand the origin of these features .",
    "the two peaked features identified previously have remarkably contrasting field dependent behavior  consistent across doping .",
    "first , the broad hump just above @xmath25 is strongly suppressed with field  it is much reduced in magnitude and is observed at lower temperatures .",
    "this is consistent with its expected origin from the spontaneous generation of vortices of one sign , which would be stabilized by trsbin contrast , the sharp peak at @xmath5 has no observable field dependence in position or magnitude , maintaining a robust presence at @xmath5 across field and doping .",
    "this strongly suggests that the latter peak does not have a superconducting origin , and could instead emerge from other nontrivial symmetry breaking phenomena@xcite .",
    "finally , we also note the field dependence of the @xmath36 background emerging at or just below @xmath33 , and persisting to lower temperatures .    * _ conventional nernst effect _ *    , at various magnetic fields for * ( a ) * @xmath13 , and * ( b ) * @xmath14 .",

    ", @xmath63 deviates from the background , with a kink observed at @xmath5 .",
    "the suppression of @xmath61 by magnetic field at temperatures below the onset of diamagnetism , @xmath24 , is a clear signature of superconducting vortices @xcite .",
    "this may result from either vortex excitations produced by phase fluctuations@xcite or from gaussian amplitude fluctuations caused by short - lived cooper pairs@xcite . in our case , @xmath61 increases dramatically below @xmath58 k for @xmath13  the onset temperature of gaussian fluctuations .",
    "this is verified in [ fig : nernst_as]c , wherein a linear relationship is observed between @xmath64 and @xmath57 for @xmath65  indicating the dominance of gaussian fluctuations@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the superconducting signatures observed over @xmath66 are likely due to vortex excitations .",
    "we note that the broad zfn peak occurs in this temperature regime , consistent with its ascribed origin to superconducting vortices resulting from trsb@xcite .",
    "finally , the absence of any measurable field - dependence signatures in @xmath61 at @xmath5 corroborate the non - superconducting origin of the @xmath5 peak in the complementary zfn measurements .",
    "our detailed doping and field - dependent studies show that the symmetric nernst effect signal observed in near-@xmath11 lbco is comprised of two distinct components  a broad , field - dependent hump above @xmath25 of superconducting origin , and a sharp field - independent peak at @xmath5 . the observed behavior of the broad hump with doping and field substantiates prior reports at @xmath3 of spontaneously generated vortices arising from trsb@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the hitherto unobserved robust peak at @xmath5 , unchanged with field , is suggestive of a stripe charge order origin .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the observed result is a large , spontaneously generated _ transverse electric field _ at @xmath5 in response to a longitudinal thermal gradient .",
    "having ruled out a superconducting origin , we consider the possibility that this results from the heat current going off - axis for extrinsic reasons , either induced by the contacts , or sample inhomogeneity .",
    "first , we point out that repeated ( 3 - 5 times ) measurements across multiple samples for each doping with fresh electrical and thermal contacts show a @xmath5 peak constant in magnitude within measurement error  discounting contact - related artifacts.next , the possibility of marked physical or chemical inhomogeneity deeper inside the sample causing this effect can also be ruled out as these should be detectable within the complementary @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath31 and @xmath69 measurements , which are instead consistent with the expected behavior at the corresponding doping@xcite . finally , in a perfectly crystalline sample , is also possible that the onset of unidirectional charge stripes drastically alters the thermal transport properties , introducing a transverse component to the thermal current .",
    "here it is worth noting that our samples are not detwinned , and such unidirectional behavior is expected to average out over the sample size , as evidenced in hall measurements@xcite .",
    "moreover , our measurements of transverse thermal gradients across this temperature range show that any such transverse effects would be an order of magnitude smaller than the the observed sharp , sizeable feature at @xmath5@xcite . furthermore , since the sample is heated to high - temperatures ( @xmath23 700  k , for contact preparation ) between successive measurements , the presence of a quantitatively reproducible peak is not tenable in such a scenario .    finally , we examine plausible scenarios wherein the @xmath5 peak emerges from intrinsic effects resulting from the onset of stripe charge order .",
    "one possibility is that the presence of some tetragonal symmetry breaking could result in the mixing of longitudinal and transverse transport coefficients .",
    "while such effects would be small or absent in a perfectly tetragonal crystal , they could be induced by charge or superconducting stripes , and would be preferentially oriented along crystallographic directions .",
    "another possibility is that this peak results from the point - group symmetry breaking emerging from nontrivial stacking of stripes@xcite , as observed in kerr effect measurements of similar samples@xcite . in this latter case",
    ", one would expect psb , and thus the zfn signal to persist to well below @xmath5 . while the peak - like manifestation of the zfn signal could , in principle , result from the interplay of a psb signal and the field - dependent background , a quantitative explanation of the observations is imperative .    in summary",
    ", we have performed a detailed investigation of the thermoelectric coefficients of near-@xmath11 lbco , with varying doping and magnetic field .",
    "our symmetric nernst effect signal is comprised of two distinct components  a broad , field - dependent hump above @xmath25 of superconducting origin , and a sharp field - independent peak at @xmath5 . while the former is consistent with prior reports indicative of spontaneous trsb , the latter , likely of stripe charge order origin , merits a comprehensive theoretical explanation .",
