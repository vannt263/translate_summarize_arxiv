    "as a remarkable aspect of high-@xmath0 superconductivity , its unique characteristics may result from the competition between more than one type of order parameter .",
    "@xcite historically , the typical antagonistic relationship between superconductivity and magnetism has led researchers to avoid using magnetic elements , such as iron , as potential building blocks of superconducting ( sc ) material .",
    "however , it is now well accepted that the unconventional superconductivity emerging upon doping is closely related to the antiferromagnetism ( afm ) in parent compounds  @xcite .",
    "recent research theme in high-@xmath0 cuprate community centers on how to establish the connection between antiferromagnetic ( af ) and @xmath1-wave sc ( dsc ) orderings  @xcite , i.e. , whether they compete with each other or coexist microscopically .",

    "depending on material details , some compounds show the coexistence of dsc and afm  @xcite while others exhibit microscopic separation of these two phases  @xcite .",
    "engineered heterogeneous systems and multilayered high-@xmath0 cuprates offer a unique setting to study the interplay between dsc and afm . in these systems , the disorder effect can be minimized significantly with atomically smooth interfaces . experimentally , no mixing of dsc and afm was reported in the heterostructure artificially grown by stacking integer number of @xmath2 and @xmath3 layers  @xcite .",

    ", we study microscopically a multi - layered system with two superconductors separated by af layers . through self - consistent mean - field theory and numerical diagonalization , we are able to solve the hamiltonian , which allows us to study the interplay between dsc and afm in detail . varying some external parameters , such as the sc phase difference across the system @xmath6 and coulomb interaction @xmath7 in the af layers leads to interesting results about the interplay .",

    "fig : orderparameter ] .",
    "it can be seen that when @xmath7 is small , there is a nonzero paring potential in the middle layers due to the proximity effect , and the two superconductors are weakly linked by the normal metallic layers . in this weak link regime , the phase of the sc pairing wavefunction is almost linear in layer number @xmath38 .",
    "this means that when the middle layers are in the normal metallic state , it has little influence on the sc layers on two sides .",
    "however , when @xmath7 is larger than @xmath80 , sdw develops , and the middle layers become mott insulator .",
    "quantum mechanically , cooper pairs can still tunnel through the sdw region when @xmath7 is not very large .",
    "we call this intermediate @xmath7 regime as the tunneling regime . from the weak link regime to tunneling regime , the phase of the sc paring wavefunction changes gradually from a ( nearly ) linear function to a step function of the layer number ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : orderparameter ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to the observation that the current shape changes from being piecewise linear to sinusoidal .",
    "therefore , when @xmath7 is very large , the current - phase relation becomes identical to the famous josephson relation  @xcite .",
    "here for the first time , we establish the connection between the profile of the sc phase distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orderparameter ] ) and the current - phase dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] ) , which we believe is rather intriguing .",
    "when one continues to increase @xmath7 , the middle layers becomes more opaque and the superconducting pairing wavefunction is completely suppressed in this region . as a result , the tunneling of cooer pairs will be completely quenched , and the two comprising superconductors become decoupled .",
    "we also would like to mention that when the middle layers are in the normal metallic state , the current across the junction is a mesoscopic effect  @xcite .",
    "the current is proportional to the phase gradient of the sc pairing wavefunction .",
    "that is , when one increases the number of sc layers , the current will decrease and finally vanish .",
    "however , when the middle layer is in the af state , the whole system becomes a jj .",
    "the current of a jj is no longer a mesoscopic effect .",
    "it is completely determined by the phase difference of the sc pairing wavefunction on both ends of the system .",
    "therefore , it will not decrease with the increase of the number of the sc layers . in this sense",
    "we say that afm insulator layers enhance supercurrent .",
    "in the above discussion , we find the profound influence of the coulomb interaction @xmath7 ( and hence afm ) of the middle layers on the dsc .",
    "we now study the back - action of dsc on afm .",
    "we will fix the phase difference @xmath6 at different values , and see if the sdw in the middle layers changes with @xmath6 .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdw ] the sdw as a function of @xmath7 for various values of @xmath81 .",
    "clearly , the sdw in the middle layers is influenced by @xmath81 in certain range of @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath91 , the critical value @xmath79 , after which the sdw develops , is much smaller than in the case of @xmath92 , though the current is zero in both cases .",
    "this is very similar to the result in ref .   that the middle af layers will be influenced by the current fed into the junction .",
    "when the coulomb interaction is very weak , the sdw does not develop for @xmath93 , and the middle layers are in the normal metallic state .",
    "in contrast , when the coulomb interaction is very strong , e.g. @xmath94 , the afm is robust against the phase difference across the junction and strongly suppresses the pairing wavefunction in the middle region ( see fig .  [",

    "the dsc on two sides will not influence the afm in the middle layer .",
    "the middle layer is described by a 2d hubbard model , in which the sdw will develop for an infinitesimal @xmath7 . in the present model ( @xmath100 ) , when @xmath97 , the sdw in the middle layers is suppressed due to the inter - layer coupling , which weakens the perfect nesting at @xmath41 .",
    "the sdw will not develop until @xmath7 is larger than a threshold value @xmath79 ( see fig .  [",
