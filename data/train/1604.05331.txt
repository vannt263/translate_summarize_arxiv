    "although more than a century has passed since the discovery of the first trojan asteroid in jupiter s orbit ( wolf 1906 ) , the origin and orbital evolution of the jupiter trojans is still a matter of debate . as of march 2012 ,",
    "a total of 5179 members have been cataloged , including numbered and multi - oppositional asteroids . of these ,",
    "3394 are located around @xmath0 , while only 1785 inhabit the tadpole region around @xmath1 .    in recent years a number of trojans have also been detected around other planets ( e.g. , innanen 1991 , tabachnik and evans 1999 , connors et al . 2011 ) . although those associated to the terrestrial planets are believed to be dynamically unstable in the long run , and therefore temporary populations , the asteroids associated to the outer planets appear more long lived . in particular",
    ", there is evidence that neptune houses a trojan population that rivals and may even surpass that around jupiter ( chiang and lithwick 2005 ) .",
    "many different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of these bodies , particularly the jupiter trojans . traditionally , these mechanisms have either disregarded planetary migration or assumed that any variation in the orbital architecture of jupiter and saturn was fairly smooth and adiabatic . according to this scenario , rouge asteroids in heliocentric orbits were trapped into the lagrange points either through the effects of gas drag with the primordial nebula ( kary and lissauer 1995 ) or through the increase in size of the tadpole regions accompanying the mass growth of jupiter itself ( marzari and scholl 1998 ) .",
    "collisions among these asteroids could also have caused sufficient changes in their orbital elements to cause permanent trapping around the equilateral lagrange points ( shoemaker et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "gomes ( 1998 ) and michtchenko et al .",
    "( 2001 ) analyzed the stability of the trojan region assuming that jupiter and saturn were locked in mean - motion resonances ( mmr ) .",
    "they found that the tadpole region would then become unstable , ejecting any primordial trojan there in place . although the aim of these papers was to place limits on planetary migration , morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) inverted this interpretation and pointed out that the same instability could also allow for the capture of new asteroids into the region .",
    "this new scenario , dubbed _",
    "chaotic capture _ , appeared as a natural consequence of the chaotic evolution of the giant planets under the nice model .",
    "contrary to more traditional theories , it seemed to be able to reproduce the inclination distribution , a dynamical characteristic until then elusive .",
    "as the nice model evolved , so did its interpretation of the origin of trojans .",
    "nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) presented new numerical simulations within the jumping - jupiter version of the nice model ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2009 , nesvorn 2011 , nesvorn and morbidelli 2012 ) .",
    "this new _ jump - capture _ mechanism proposes that part of the remnant planetesimal disk was trapped in the lagrange points following almost instantaneous changes in the semimajor axis of jupiter caused by close encounters with ice giants .",
    "perhaps the most prominent and curious dynamical characteristic of the jupiter trojans is the observed asymmetry between the populations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "not only does the leading swarm have almost @xmath6 more asteroids than the trailing region ( grav et al .",
    "2011 , nesvorn et al .",
    "2013 ) , but there are also significant differences in the asteroid families .",
    "while @xmath0 hosts several numerous family candidates ( eurypides being the most notorious , see beaug and roig 2001 , bro and rosehnal 2011 ) , the region around @xmath1 only contains small ( albeit compact ) agglomerations .",
    "the origin of this asymmetry is still a mystery .",
    "dynamical studies of the trojan region show the same resonance structure and stability limits in both lagrange points , even when considering the perturbations of additional planets ( e.g. rdi 1996 , marzari et al .",
    "2002 , robutel and gabern 2006 ) .",
    "most of the proposed formation mechanisms also predict similar populations in both equilateral lagrange points , including the first versions of the nice model ( e.g. morbidelli et al . 2005 ) .",
    "so , it appears that even under the most complex scenarios , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are dynamically equivalent",
    ". however , recently hou et al .",
    "( 2014 ) showed that a temporary asymmetry my be obtained with the same initial conditions in both tadpole regions .",
    "this asymmetry , however , is short - lived and can not at present account for the observed disparity .",
    "perhaps even more drastic measures are necessary to create an asymmetry . in the mechanism proposed by nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , close encounters with an ice giant could have partially depleted one of the lagrange points while leaving the other virtually unaffected . once again , as it occurs several times in exoplanetary systems , planetary scattering appears as an excitation mechanism much more effective than slow - acting long - range gravitational perturbations .",
    "since scattering is stochastic and extremely sensitive to initial conditions , the final ratio of trojans in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath7 ) is not deterministic .",
    "however , some of the runs presented in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) do seem to be able to obtain values similar to those observed in the real asteroids .",
    "the aims of this paper are very simple . since it is known that even today the trojan population is undergoing slow chaotic diffusion ( tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 , rdi et al .",
    "2013 ) , what dynamical characteristics can be considered primordial ?",
    "in particular , can the current @xmath7 ratio be considered invariant in time , or was the original asymmetry different ?    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review and analyze the main physical and dynamical characteristics of the trojan swarm and present the results of a long term integration of observed trojans . in section 3 , we extend our gyr - simulations to fictitious massless particles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and compare those results with the evolution of the real asteroids . finally , discussions and conclusions close the paper in section 4",
    "as of march 2013 , there were 2972 numbered jupiter trojans , thus with fairly reliable orbits . of these , 1975 ( over @xmath8 )",
    "display tadpole orbits around @xmath0 , while 997 are associated to @xmath1 .",
    "the population of jupiter trojans is believed to be complete up to absolute magnitude @xmath9 ( szab et al .",
    "2007 ) ; however for the purposes of the present study we will consider the complete ( numbered ) population regardless of the absolute magnitude .",

    "the upper half of the plots ( positive values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) corresponds to @xmath0 , while the lower half corresponds to @xmath1 .",
    "the orbital elements are osculating , but each asteroid was integrated until it crossed the representative plane defined by the conditions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the mean anomaly , @xmath19 the longitude of pericenter and @xmath20 the longitude of the ascending node .",

    "the orbits were evolved using the hybrid integrator evorb ( fernndez et al .",
    "2002 ) including the gravitational perturbations of all outer planets .",
    "the masses of the inner planets were added to the sun , and we adopted a time - step of 0.2 years .",
    "one of the most interesting dynamical characteristics of the trojan asteroids is that not all of them lie in orbits that are stable over time - spans comparable with the age of the solar system .",
    "although the chaotic nature of some of these asteroids has been known for many years ( e.g. milani 1993 ) , at first it was not clear whether this chaoticity was local ( i.e. `` stable - chaos '' ) or whether it could lead to ultimate escapes from the lagrange points .",
    "levison et al . (",
    "1997 ) were the first to present gyr - long numerical simulations of known and fictitious trojans , showing that indeed approximately @xmath21 of the asteroids were unstable due to the gravitational perturbations of the other giant planets in times of the order of the age of the solar system .",
    "furthermore , they showed that the orbits of the escaped asteroids resemble those of the jupiter family comets .",
    "tsiganis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) revisited this problem , calculating dynamical maps of lyapunov characteristic exponents for grids of elements @xmath22 for a set of discrete values of the inclination @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the semi - amplitude of libration of the asteroid . although their total integration time was only equal to @xmath24 myr , it was sufficient to correlate their maps with the distribution of real trojans , and identify which asteroids could lie in unstable orbits . those candidates were integrated a second time for @xmath3 gyr , confirming the unstable nature of their motion .",
    "the results of tsiganis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that @xmath25 of the real trojans escape from the lagrange regions in this time interval and are effectively unstable .",
    "the `` effective '' stability region shrinks with increasing orbital inclination .",

    "[ fig1 ] , the inclinations of @xmath1 trojans seems to be more disperse than in @xmath0 .",
    "there is a well - defined set of low inclination trojans in @xmath0 that is not observed in such a number in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , while the mean values of osculating semimajor axis and eccentricity are almost the same for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath27 au , @xmath28 au , @xmath29 , the mean value of the inclinations in @xmath1 is greater than in @xmath0 : @xmath30 .",
    "both results are in agreement with slyusarev ( 2013 ) .    however , the difference in inclination distribution is size - dependent .",
    "there are a number of papers that analyzed the dependence of the cumulative size distribution ( csd ) and albedos on the trojan sizes .",
    "jewitt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that there must be a break in the csd at diameters @xmath31 km .",
    "yoshida and nakamura ( 2008 ) analized the csd of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and found that on a range of @xmath32 km @xmath33 km , the slope of the csd is nearly constant , breaking at @xmath34 km .",
    "fraser et al . (",
    "2014 ) obtained a csd power - law for trojans that breaks at absolute magnitude @xmath35 , that corresponds to a diameter @xmath36 km ( for albedo 0.045 ) .",
    "fernandez et al . ( 2003 ) derived visual albedos for 32 trojans with diameters @xmath37 km and found a mean value of 0.056 and 0.041 depending on the beaming parameter .",
    "later , fernandez et al . ( 2009 ) presented thermal observations of 44 small trojans with diameters @xmath38 km and found a median value of 0.12 , higher than that of the large trojans .",
    "they attributed this correlation albedo - size to the collisional evolution , which makes that the smaller trojans are more likely to be collisional fragments of larger bodies and thus they have younger surfaces implying cleanest ones .",
    "then , considering the albedos it seems that there is a certain diameter transition in the range @xmath39 that divide two `` species '' of trojans , the greater ones would be primordial and the smaller the product of a collisional evolution and fragments of families .",
    "considering the break of the csd obtained in the previous mentioned papers , a transition between small and large trojans would be in the range @xmath40 .",
    "taking those works into account , we chose a transition diameter between `` small '' and `` large '' trojans at @xmath41 km in order to analyze the inclination distribution size dependence .",
    "we test however , greater values of @xmath42 which showed no significant differences .",
    "we have calculated that @xmath43 km@xmath44 meanwhile @xmath45 km@xmath46 and @xmath47 km@xmath48 meanwhile @xmath49 km@xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the normalized distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 trojans for all of them and for the smaller ( @xmath51 km ) and the greater ones ( @xmath26 km ) .",
    "we can see that the @xmath0 population has a set of low inclination trojans proportionally more numerous than the @xmath1 population .",
    "this trend is maintained for the smaller trojans but it is not noticed for the greater ones .",
    "this means that there are more @xmath0 small trojans in the small inclination population ( say less than @xmath52 ) than @xmath1 small trojans .",
    "however the whole @xmath1 population is `` biased '' to high inclinations with respect to the @xmath0 population and this behavior is present for both the smaller and the greater ones .",
    "the question is to discern if this is primordial or a consequence of a different evolution ?",
    "we will address this topic again in the future sections .",
    "contrary to the main belt asteroids , where chaotic diffusion is mainly fueled by non - conservative forces like yarkovsky thermal effects ( e.g. farinella and vokrouhlick 1999 ) , the inherent instability of the trojans appears purely gravitational and caused by secondary and secular resonances within the tadpole regions ( robutel et al .",
    "2005 , robutel and gabern 2006 ) .",
    "this seems to indicate that the full orbital characteristics of the trojans can not be estimated from short ( myr ) timescale integrations , and that very slow diffusive and dynamical effects contribute to sculpt the distribution of these swarms .",
    "the implications of the results of levison et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and tsiganis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are sufficiently interesting to merit a new analysis .",
    "contrary to these works , we analyzed each lagrange point separately , analyzing whether the instability of each swarm showed differences .",
    "we performed a numerical integration of all 2972 numbered jupiter trojans under the gravitational action of the sun and the four giant planets over 4.5 gyr .",
    "we used the hybrid integrator evorb ( fernndez et al .",
    "each integration was stopped if the particle suffered a close encounter with a planet ( i.e. mutual distance smaller than the corresponding hill radius ) .",
    "we took notice of the time of each `` escape '' and the condition under which it occurred .     for numbered trojans in @xmath0 ( top ) and @xmath1 ( bottom ) .",
    "the left frame shows all asteroids , while the middle plot presents only those that remain stable after 4.5 gyrs .",
    "the right - hand graph shows stable numbered trojans with absolute magnitude @xmath53.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    from the present day trojans , approximately @xmath2 were found to escape from the @xmath0 swarm , while this number increased to @xmath4 for @xmath1 .",
    "the percentage of @xmath0 escapees is higher than that estimated by tsiganis et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and about twice the proportion mentioned by levison et al .",
    "since our integrations included all the numbered asteroids , we believe our results are more representative of the real diffusion within the trojan swarms . in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] the unstable asteroids are shown in red , while those that remained tied to tadpole orbits are depicted in black . while there appears to be little correlation between both sub - sets in the @xmath11 plane ,",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath54 planes show that the escaped asteroids are preferably those with larger libration amplitude or with larger orbital eccentricity .",
    "since the trojan population is already several gyrs old , it is safe to assume that the original population covered a much larger region of the phase space , and that the escapees detected here are characterized by only very weak chaoticity .",
    "approximately @xmath55 for @xmath1 and @xmath56 for @xmath0 of the ejections occurred after a close encounter with jupiter and the rest due to encounters with saturn .",
    "the middle graph of figure [ fig3 ] shows the distribution of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 swarms considering only stable orbits , while the plot on the right is further restricted to those asteroids with absolute magnitude @xmath53 . at least from a first - hand analysis",
    ", there appears no distinction between the two swarms . in all cases ,",
    "however , there is a noticeable paucity of asteroids with small amplitudes of libration @xmath23 as well as small values of @xmath57 .",
    "this is indicative of a well known property : most of the trojans display significant amplitudes of oscillation of both the resonant and secular degrees of freedom .    ) as function of time , for both trojan swarms .",

    "the left - hand graph shows the number of escapees ( @xmath60 ) as a function of time , where the black curve corresponds to the @xmath0 swarm and red is reserved for @xmath1 . in both cases",
    "the escape rate decreases with time until it appears close to constant for @xmath61 gyrs .",
    "it is very probable that the escape rate @xmath62 was much larger during the early stages of of the solar system , and we are currently just detecting the tail of the distribution .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that there is no evidence of a leveling off and a tendency for @xmath63 at any given time .    while the escape rate in @xmath0 is about @xmath64 larger than that in @xmath1 , this number is affected by the larger population in the leading trojan swarm .",
    "the right plot of figure [ fig4 ] shows the evolution of the total number of surviving bodies in terms of the original population . as the escape rate , for @xmath65 gyrs , the survival rate ( in terms of the original population , @xmath59 ) @xmath66 is almost linear .",
    "in fact it is possible to fit a linear relation for both lagrangian points obtaining that the survival rate for @xmath67 gyrs is given by : @xmath68 for @xmath0 , and @xmath69 for @xmath1 .",
    "that is , the number of surviving observed trojans decreases with time at a rate given by @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "then , although the trailing trojans loose a smaller number of asteroids per unit time , the total population actually decreases faster than that associated to the leading swarm ( e.g for @xmath67 gyrs , @xmath72 ) . in consequence ,",
    "the ratio between @xmath73 and @xmath74 increases with time ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) , from a current value of @xmath75 to a future value of @xmath76 in @xmath3 gyrs time . even though the two numbers are not drastically different , it is interesting to speculate whether the value could in fact have been significantly lower at the time of the capture of the trojan asteroids .     and @xmath1.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the time - weighted distribution of the osculating elements of the fictitious trojans throughout the simulation .",
    "these dynamical maps of permanence are analogous to those shown in figure [ fig6 ] , but unaffected by the initial conditions of the particles .",
    "we find no significant difference between the two tadpole regions , indicating that not only the escape rate , but also their dynamical structure appear to be equivalent , even on gyr timescales .      even though the synthetic populations show the same escape rate , our simulations with real trojans indicate that the trailing population actually decreases faster than that associated to the leading swarm . at the end of their dynamical evolution , 1517 @xmath0 trojans ( out of 1975 ) and 715 @xmath1 asteroids ( out of 997 ) survived in the integration .",
    "if this proportion is representative of the different escape rate of the original swarms , then we can relate the present - day populations @xmath77 with the original numbers @xmath78 via a simple linear law :    @xmath79    even though this difference is not large , it is statistically significant when compared with the escape rates of the s synthetic population .    if , as calculated by grav et al . ( 2011 )",
    ", the present unbiased fraction of trojans between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath80 , then , from eq .",
    "[ ns ] we can estimate the original population ratio as    @xmath81    with this calculation , the difference in the survival rate between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , accounts for @xmath82 of the total asymmetry or , in other words , it has contributed to @xmath83 of the present unbiased asymmetry .",
    "consequently , at least part of the observed asymmetry must be primordial and related to the capture / formation process of these asteroids .",
    "since the dynamics appear equal , then the difference must lie in the distribution of the trojans around each lagrange point . as we mentioned in sect ( [ ini ] ) , the inclinations of the observed trojans in @xmath0 show an excess with respect to the inclination distribution of @xmath1 trojans in the range @xmath84 and this is attributed mainly to small - size bodies . however , even large - size trojans in @xmath1 appear to have a broader inclination distribution , so the difference can not be solely due to small asteroids .    one possible scenario has been recently proposed by nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , where a hypothetical ice giant planet ( later ejected from the solar system ) transversed the @xmath1 cloud , partially scattering its population and modifying the inclination distribution .",
    "another possibility could be related to different collisional evolution in each lagrange point , for example , due to larger asteroids captured in @xmath0 than in @xmath1 , producing a larger collisional cascade of fragments at @xmath0 .",
    "this could also explain the numerous family candidates at @xmath0 , while only small agglomerations are detected around @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a series of numerical integrations of real and fictitious jupiter trojans over time - spans comparable with the age of the solar system .",
    "we obtained that fictitious bodies with the same initial distribution in both lagrange points , show the same dynamical evolution and orbital instability for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . however",
    "the evolution of the observed population in the trailing trojan point decays faster than that associated to the leading region . for the present day trojans ,",
    "approximately @xmath2 were found to escape from @xmath0 swarm after @xmath3 gyrs , while this number increased to @xmath4 for @xmath1 .",
    "we believe this is mainly due to a difference in the orbital element distribution of the bodies and not to any inherent dynamical process which may be more effective in one of the tadpole regions .    from the present - day ratio of asteroids in @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 ,",
    "we have estimated the original ratio , assuming that the current escape rates may be extrapolated backwards to primordial times .",
    "this assumption is not obvious , and must be considered with care .",
    "however , the results show that the original population ratio must have been much closer to unity , indicating that perhaps both lagrange points contained originally similar number of asteroids .",
    "finally , we have also calculated the proper elements of numbered asteroids using the semi - analytical method of beaug and roig ( 2001 ) , and compared the results with the numerical estimations by bro and rosehnal ( 2011 ) .",
    "we found that both methods yield very similar results for numbered asteroids , but not for asteroids that are now numbered but were multi - oppositional in 2011 .",
    "this seems to indicate that only the numbered asteroids have sufficiently well determined orbits to allow for detailed and long - term dynamical analysis .",
