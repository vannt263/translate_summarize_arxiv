    "tectonic plate construction of the earth lithosphere is generally accepted and recently well described ( for example , see @xcite ) . moreover , the tectonic plates of another planets of the solar system , such as mars and venus , are a subject of investigations as well @xcite . the tectonic plate motion as a reason of earthquakes is also a widely held view . however , the mechanism of the earthquakes emergence in a course of the plate motions is subject of intensive investigations in geosciences and geophysics as well as in mathematics and physics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the most popular models represent a _ stick - slip _ motion . brace and byerlee @xcite suggested that earthquakes must be the result of a stick - slip frictional instability rather then caused by fracture appearance and propagation .",
    "the earthquake being the result of a sudden slip along a pre - existing fault or plate surface and the  stick \" being the interseismic period of strain accumulation .",
    "for example san andreas fault or benioff - wadati subduction zones , seem to exhibit sudden slip events followed by  silent \" slip and renewal of the contact points creating a stick behavior .",
    "this idea has been applied in several laboratory experiments which lead to models consistent with ruina - dietrich  rate and state - variable friction law \" @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another theoretical model following this idea was proposed in @xcite ( burridge - knopoff model ) , where experimental and theoretical results are discussed .",
    "the model in @xcite is a one - dimension chain of massive blocks tied by springs and situated on a rough unmoving surface .",
    "the heading block is pulled with a constant speed",
    ". then the train of rest blocks shows the stick - slip behavior under some conditions related to resistance forces between blocks and the rough surface .",
    "in this paper we suggest a model for the stick - slip dynamics .",
    "the model describes a stochastic dynamics on a micro - level .",
    "it is the stochastic dynamics of a point field which is a set of contact points on surfaces .",
    "a combination of three types of changes forms the dynamics of the plate : 1 ) a deterministic motion causing a deformation of the contact points and the increase of strain ; 2 ) an appearance of new contacts that changes the dynamics ; 3 ) break of the existent contacts which causes a jump - wise change of the dynamics velocity .",
    "some of physical phenomena are described in the model by a number of parameters .",
    "one of the parameters is a rate of contact destructions .",
    "we show that these parameters are related to the gutenberg - richter law ( see @xcite ) . for the elastic resistance we assume a linear dependence of the force on a value of the contact deformation .",
    "the model defined and numerically analyzed in @xcite is the most similar model we found in the literature .",
    "the micro - level model defined by a markov piece - wise deterministic random process is a base for a macro - level model represented by a system of integro - differential equations .",
    "this model is rather universal to describe tectonic plate motions as well as the friction between different matter plates .",
    "the mean field method used in this paper was also applied in @xcite .",
    "sections [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] contain the descriptions and the basic results including the condition when the gutenberg - richter law is satisfied",
    ". this condition requires a special asymptotic law for the breaks of the contact points which we call _ inverse deformation law_. section [ s4 ] contains some rigorous descriptions .",
    "we consider a plate moving on a solid unmoving substrate with contact area @xmath0 .",
    "the plate is subjected to the action of a constant force @xmath1 in some fixed direction ( a _ moving force _ ) .",
    "the moving force causes a motion of the plate in the direction of @xmath1 .",
    "asperities of both plate and solid substrate can be contacted , what creates a resistance force due to deformation of the contacting asperities .",
    "the set of _ contact points _ we denote by @xmath2 and its elements by @xmath3 .",
    "the set @xmath2 is a finite subset of @xmath0 .",
    "in the course of the plate motion , any contacting asperity is being deformed until its failure .",
    "any contact point @xmath4 creates a resistant force depending on magnitude of the asperity deformation . in a general",
    "setting the resistant force is an expression @xmath5 , where is a constant from @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath7 then the resistance is purely elastic , and @xmath8 is hooke s constant .",
    "the sum of all resistance forces over all contact points gives the total resistance force .",
    "therefore the resultant force acting on the plate is @xmath9_+,\\ ] ] where @xmath10_+=\\max\\{a,0\\}$ ] .",
    "this means that the resistance force can not be greater than the moving force .",
    "the force @xmath11 causes a deterministic motion of the plate .",
    "we assume that the plate is a monolithic hard object any point of which is moving with the same velocity @xmath12 .",
    "the next our assumption implies that the dynamics of the plate under the force action follows the so called aristotle mechanics .",
    "it means that the velocity @xmath12 of the motion is proportional to the acting force , @xmath13 in contrast to newton mechanics where the acceleration is proportional to the acting force . here",
    "@xmath14 is constant .",
    "this assumption is due to the fact that the moving plate is immersed in a viscous medium and therefore inertia , despite the large mass of the plate , has little influence on the nature of the motion .    if during a time interval @xmath15 $ ] the set @xmath2 is not changed ( a new contact does not appear and any existing contact does not disappear ) then we have a deterministic dynamics on @xmath15 $ ] evolving according to the equation @xmath16_+\\ ] ] with an initial velocity value @xmath17 , ( see ( [ force ] ) and ( [ arist ] ) ) . here we denote @xmath18 .    in the case of the elastic resistance forces ( @xmath7 ) , if @xmath19_+=\\gamma\\bigl(f-\\varkappa\\sum_{\\omega ' \\in\\omega } x_{\\omega'}(t_1)\\bigr)>0\\ ] ] then a solution of ( [ dyn2 ] ) on @xmath15 $ ] is @xmath20 for @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 is a number of the points ( the contacts ) in the set @xmath2 ( see rigorous evaluations in the section [ s41 ] ) .",
    "this dynamics determines the motion of the plate when the set of contact points is fixed .",
    "the deterministic dynamics is interrupted by random events of two kinds : either some contact from @xmath2 disappears or a new contact appears .",
    "in both cases the number of the contacts is changed from @xmath23 to either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "next we describe the dynamics of the appearance and disappearance ( birth and death ) of the contact points .",
    "these dynamics are random and of markov type .",
    "assume that there were no any random events on the interval @xmath15 $ ] , and at @xmath26 a new contact appears .",
    "its deformation is equal to 0 at the moment @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be a set of all contact point deformations .",
    "the contact set @xmath2 is changed to a set @xmath28 at the moment @xmath26 , and the new deformation set is @xmath29 .",
    "it is assumed that the birth of new contact points at @xmath26 depends on the velocity @xmath30_+$ ] of the plate .",
    "this dependence is determined by a birth rate @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath32 should reflect physical properties of the plate such as a fractal dimension of the asperities and many others .",
    "it is clear that new contacts do not appear if the velocity @xmath12 is zero , hence @xmath33 .",
    "a natural choice of @xmath32 is @xmath34 , linear dependence on the velocity , where @xmath35 .    because the new contact deformation is 0 then @xmath36 thus the velocity @xmath37 is continuous at @xmath38 .",
    "however the velocity derivative @xmath39 at @xmath26 is discontinuous ; see figure  [ f1 ] of a typical path of the velocity .",
    "the left derivative at @xmath26 is greater than the right one at the same time @xmath26 . in the case of elastic resistance forces : @xmath40 where @xmath23 .",
    "the disappearance ( death ) of a contact @xmath3 from @xmath2 is determined by the rate @xmath41 , it may depend on the deformation @xmath42 .",
    "if at the moment @xmath26 the contact @xmath3 disappears then the velocity has discontinuity at @xmath26 . the velocity increases abruptly by the value @xmath43 .",
    "we shall assume that the velocity is continuous from the right at @xmath26 , that is @xmath44      we describe now a complete evolution of the plate velocity by the dynamic described above .",
    "the time is split into the intervals @xmath45=\\bigcup[t_i , t_{i+1}]$ ] such that during every interval @xmath46 $ ] the plate is moving deterministically according to ( [ dyn2 ] ) and ( [ vel ] ) substituting @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
    "the set of the points @xmath49 is the moments of random events : either a new contact appears or one of the existing contacts disappears .",
    "the set of the random moments @xmath50 is splitted by the set @xmath51 of the appearing contacts and the set @xmath52 of the disappearing contacts , @xmath53 .",
    "any disappearance of the contact releases an energy which switches to an energy of seismic waves in the plates .",
    "the amount of released energy depends on the deformation value @xmath42 of the disappeared contact .",
    "we assume that the seismic wave energy is proportional to the primitive of the resistance force ( the potential ) . for large deformation @xmath54",
    "it is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath42 is large then the oscillation amplitude may be large which can be observed as an earthquake .",
    "is a piece - wise continuous function between two nearest deaths of the contacts .",
    "the velocity has jumps at moments of the death of particle .",
    "the derivative of the velocity increases abruptly at the moment of the birth of a particle ( blue circle ) . ]    a typical random path of the velocity is presented on figure [ f1 ] .",
    "in this section we propose an analytical approach which allows to study some properties of the defined model .",
    "the idea is to consider a very large number of the asperities .",
    "it means that we consider a limit of the size of the contact area @xmath0 going to infinity . in the limit",
    "we obtain infinite number of asperities and then a distribution of the asperity deformations is described by a density function @xmath56 , @xmath57 has a meaning of a number of the asperities having their deformation in the interval @xmath58 at the moment @xmath59 . to obtain a reasonable model in this limit we have to change the values of the parameters determining the plate motion model .",
    "some of the parameters must depend on the size of the contact surface @xmath0 .",
    "namely , the birth intensity @xmath60 and the acting force @xmath61 , are proportional to the size @xmath0 .",
    "the death parameter we take without changes @xmath62 .",
    "further we omit the sign @xmath63 .",

    "in this subsection we study some properties of ( [ y-3 ] ) in a stationary regime , when @xmath56 does not depend on time @xmath59 .",

    "the stationarity the velocity @xmath12 of the plate does not depend on time @xmath59 .",
