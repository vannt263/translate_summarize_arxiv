    "the _ complexity _ of a natural number @xmath1 is the least number of @xmath11 s needed to write it using any combination of addition and multiplication , with the order of the operations specified using parentheses grouped in any legal nesting .",
    "for instance , @xmath12 has a complexity of @xmath13 , since it can be written using @xmath13 ones as @xmath14 , but not with any fewer .",
    "this notion was implicitly introduced in 1953 by kurt mahler and jan popken @xcite ; they actually considered the inverse function of the size of the largest number representable using @xmath15 copies of the number @xmath11 .",
    "( more generally , they considered the same question for representations using @xmath15 copies of a positive real number @xmath16 . )",
    "integer complexity was explicitly studied by john selfridge , and was later popularized by richard guy @xcite . following j. arias",
    "de reyna @xcite we will denote the complexity of @xmath1 by @xmath0 .",
    "integer complexity is approximately logarithmic ; it satisfies the bounds @xmath17 the lower bound can be deduced from the result of mahler and popken , and was explicitly proved by john selfridge @xcite .",
    "it is attained with equality for @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "the upper bound can be obtained by writing @xmath1 in binary and finding a representation using horner s algorithm .",
    "it is not sharp , and the constant @xmath20 can be improved for large @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the notion of integer complexity is similar in spirit but different in detail from the better known measure of _ addition chain length _ , which has application to computation of powers , and which is discussed in detail in knuth ( * ? ? ?",
    "one important difference between the two notions is that integer complexity can be computed by dynamic programming , while this does not seem to be the case for addition chain length .",
    "specifically , integer complexity is computable via the dynamic programming recursion , for any @xmath21 ,    @xmath22    there are many mysteries about @xmath0 . for powers one has @xmath23 and it is known that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "however other values have a more complicated behavior .",
    "for instance , powers of @xmath26 do not work nicely , as @xmath27 .",
    "the behavior of powers of @xmath28 remains unknown ; it has been verified that @xmath29 see @xcite .      in an earlier paper , this author and zelinsky @xcite introduced the notion the _ defect _ of an integer @xmath1 , denoted @xmath3 , by @xmath30 this is a rescaled version of integer complexity , which , given @xmath1 , contains equivalent information to @xmath31 . in view of the lower bound above",
    "it satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "the paper @xcite exploited patterns in the dynamic programming structure of integer complexity to classify the structure of all integers with small values of the defect .",
    "in particular it classifies all integers with @xmath33 .",
    "the defect encodes interesting structure about integer complexity . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the image of this defect function in the general case :    the _ defect set _",
    "@xmath34 is the set of all defect values @xmath35 .",
    "addition and multiplication tend to interact badly and unpredictably when placed on an equal footing .",
    "so one might not expect to find any particular sort of structure in the values of @xmath3 , even though its definition is based on powers of @xmath36 which give the extremal case . in this paper we will prove the following striking result :    [ frontpagethm ]",
    "the set @xmath6 is a well - ordered subset of @xmath37 , of order type @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath8 an integer , the set @xmath9 has order type @xmath10 .",
    "this well - ordering of the defect set @xmath6 reveals new fundamental structure in the interaction between addition and multiplication .",
    "some of the tangledness of that interaction may be reflected in how the set @xmath6 grows more complicated as its elements get larger .",
    "in fact the structure of @xmath6 has even more regularity than what theorem [ frontpagethm ] describes , which we plan to discuss in a future paper .    in section  [ variants ] , we will also prove that theorem still holds even if we replace @xmath6 with any of several other closely - related sets .",
    "theorem  [ frontpagethm ] is closely related to conjectures of j. arias de reyna @xcite about integer complexity .",
    "we discuss these conjectures and use our results to prove modified versions of some of them in appendix  [ secarias ] .",
    "in contrast to theorem [ frontpagethm ] , little is known about the set of values of @xmath38 , even though that might appear to be a more natural object of study .",
    "an open question is to determine the value @xmath39 the bounds imply @xmath40 .",
    "it is an open problem to decide whether @xmath41 or @xmath42 holds .      the strategy to prove the main theorem is to build up the set @xmath6 by inductively building up the sets @xmath43 for real numbers @xmath44 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ frontpagethm ] makes use of earlier work of this author with zelinsky @xcite classifying numbers of low defect .",
    "the paper @xcite gave a method to list families of such integers , and explicitly listed all integers of defect @xmath45 .",
    "the innovation made here is that instead of treating the output of this method as an undifferentiated blob , we group it into tractable families .",
    "we introduce a family of multilinear polynomials that we call _ low - defect polynomials_. we show that for any @xmath44 , there exists a finite set of low - defect polynomials @xmath46 such that any number of defect less than @xmath47 can be written as @xmath48 for some @xmath49 and nonnegative @xmath50 .",
    "indeed , stronger statements are true ; see theorem  [ mainthm ] and theorem  [ augmainthm ] .",
    "note , however , that the low - defect polynomials may also produce extraneous numbers , with defect higher than intended ; examples of these are given after theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "we will remedy this deficiency in a sequel paper @xcite .    to state this another way ,",
    "these low - defect polynomials provide forms into which powers of @xmath36 can be substituted to obtain all the numbers below the specified defect . as the defects get larger , the low - defect polynomials and the families of numbers we get this way become more complicated . and",
    "just as we can visualize expressions in @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath11 as trees , we can also visualize low - defect polynomials  or the expressions that generate them  as trees , with open slots where powers of @xmath36 can be plugged in . by attaching trees corresponding to powers of @xmath36 , we obtain trees for the numbers we get this way .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ treefig1 ] with the polynomial @xmath53 .",
    "( note , however , that this picture is not quite correct when we plug in @xmath54 ; see figure  [ treefig2 ] in section  [ secpolys ] ) .    cc [ treefig1 ]    ( .@xmath51 . ( .@xmath52 .",

    ", we can get at properties of the set of defects by examining properties of low - defect polynomials . for instance , as mentioned above , as the defects involved get larger , the low - defect polynomials required get more complicated ; one way in which this occurs is that they require more variables .",
    "in fact , we will see ( theorem  [ mainthm ] ) that to cover defects up to a real number @xmath47 , one needs low - defect polynomials with up to @xmath57 variables . and it happens that if we have a low defect polynomial @xmath58 in @xmath15 variables , and consider the numbers @xmath59 , then the defects of the numbers obtained this way form a well - ordered set of order type at least @xmath10 and less than @xmath60 ( proposition  [ wo2 ] ) .",
    "it is this that leads us to theorem  [ frontpagethm ] , that for @xmath8 , the set @xmath9 has order type precisely @xmath10 . in future papers",
    "we will draw more detailed conclusions by examining the structure of low - defect polynomials more closely .",
    "we also prove analogues of the main theorem for several other sets .",
    "the paper @xcite showed that given the value of @xmath3 , one can determine the value of @xmath0 modulo @xmath36 ; see theorem  [ oldprops](6 ) below .",
    "it follows that one can split the set of defects @xmath6 into sets @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 according to these congruence classes modulo @xmath36 ; see definition  [ dftseta ] . in section  [ variants ]",
    "we prove analogues of the main theorem for each set @xmath64 separately ; see theorem  [ thmfinal ] .",
    "the paper @xcite also introduced a notion of stable numbers ; a number @xmath1 is said to be _ stable _ if @xmath65 for all @xmath66 ; equivalently , if @xmath67 for all @xmath68 . in section  [ secstab ]",
    "we show that given @xmath3 , one can determine whether or not a given number @xmath1 is stable , and thus we can consider the set of `` stable defects '' , @xmath69 , which are the defect values for all stable numbers .    we can combine this notion with splitting based on the value of @xmath0 modulo @xmath36 to define sets @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in section  [ variants ]",
    "we prove each of these sets is well - ordered of type @xmath73 , as are the closures of all these sets .",
    "all these well - ordering results are collected in theorem  [ thmfinal ] .",
    "integer complexity captures part of the complicated interaction of addition and multiplication , where subtraction is not allowed ; the underlying algebraic structure is that of a commutative semiring @xmath74 .",
    "it is a very simple computational model , but already exhibits difficult issues .    the model of computation treated in this paper could be considered as taking number inputs other than @xmath11 .",
    "mahler and popken @xcite considered constructing numbers starting with copies of any fixed positive real number @xmath16 .",
    "note that as @xmath16 varies the ordering of computed quantities on the positive real line will change .",
    "one feature of complexity for @xmath75 ( or for @xmath76 , an integer ) is that multiple ties that can occur in doing the computations , which complicates determination of the structure of the minimal computation tree .",
    "for a generic ( transcendental ) @xmath16 , the complexity issue simplifies to viewing the computation tree as computing a univariate polynomial with positive integer coefficients , having a zero constant term .",
    "one can assign a complexity to the problem of computing such polynomials .",
    "study of this simplified problem might be fruitful . allowing multiple indeterminates as inputs",
    ", we can consider the complexity of computing multivariate polynomials , which is a much - studied topic .",
    "the model of computation allowing @xmath51 and @xmath52 above can compute all multivariate polynomials with nonnegative integer coefficients , but is restricted in that it does not allow free reuse of polynomials already constructed .",
    "the complexity of computation in this restricted model can be compared to that in other computational models which allow additional operations beyond addition and multiplication , or allow free reuse of already computed polynomials ( straight - line computation ) .",
    "it is much easier to compute polynomials in models with subtraction @xcite or division @xcite than with only addition and multiplication @xcite .",
    "indeed , similar phenomena occur in the computation of integers as well as that of polynomials @xcite",
    ".    we can also ask about the computational complexity of integer complexity itself , or related notions , viewed in the polynomial hierarchy of complexity theory ( see garey and johnson ( * ? ? ? * sect . 7.2 ) ) .",
    "an open question concerns the computational complexity of computing @xmath0 .",
    "consider the problem : + integer complexity    * instance : positive integers @xmath1 and @xmath15 , both encoded in binary .",
    "* question : is @xmath77 ?",
    "this problem is known to be in the complexity class @xmath78 ( arias de reyna @xcite ) , but it is not known to be either in @xmath79 or in co-@xmath78 , nor is it known to be @xmath78-complete .",
    "this paper introduces the ordering of defects as an object of investigation .",
    "hence we can also consider the problem : + defect ordering    * instance : positive integers @xmath80 and @xmath81 , both encoded in binary .",
    "* question : is @xmath82 ?    this problem , of computing the defect ordering is not known to be in the complexity class np .",
    "if one could answer integer complexity in polynomial time , then one could also answer defect ordering in polynomial time . to show this ,",
    "observe that the inequality @xmath83 is equivalent to @xmath84 and since @xmath0 is logarithmically small , this could be computed in polynomial time if one knew @xmath0 .",
    "this argument shows that defect ordering belongs to the complexity class @xmath85 .",
    "another question related to the defect is that of computing a set @xmath46 of low - defect polynomials sufficient to describe all integers of defect @xmath86 , i.e. , a set @xmath46 satisfying the conditions of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "what is the minimal cardinality of such a set , as a function of @xmath47 ?",
    "what is the complexity of computing one ( say for @xmath47 integral , or rational ) ?",
    "the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] does give a construction of one such set @xmath46 ; however there exist other such sets @xmath46 , perhaps some smaller or computable more quickly than the one constructed .",
    "we begin by reviewing the relevant properties of integer complexity and the defect from @xcite . they can be summed up in the following theorem :    [ oldprops ] we have :    1 .   for all @xmath1 , @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath66 , @xmath87 , with equality if and only if @xmath88 . the difference @xmath89 is a nonnegative integer .",

    "given any @xmath1 , there exists @xmath93 such that for all @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath96 . 5 .   for a given defect @xmath97 , the set @xmath98 has either the form @xmath99 for some @xmath1 and @xmath93 , or the form @xmath100 for some @xmath1 .",
    "this latter occurs if and only if @xmath97 is the smallest defect among @xmath101 for @xmath102 . 6 .   if @xmath103 , then @xmath104 . 7 .",
    "@xmath105 , and for @xmath8 , @xmath106 .",
    "no other integers occur as @xmath3 for any @xmath1 .",
    "part ( 1 ) is just selfridge s lower bound @xcite .",
    "the first statement in part ( 2 ) is proposition  9(3 ) from @xcite ; the second statement follows from the computation @xmath107 .",
    "part ( 3 ) is proposition  14(1 ) from @xcite .",
    "parts ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are theorem  5 from @xcite .",
    "part ( 6 ) is part of proposition  14(2 ) from @xcite . for part ( 7 ) , the fact that @xmath105 is immediate .",
    "the fact that @xmath106 for @xmath8 is the same as the fact that @xmath108 for @xmath8 ; that @xmath109 is obvious , and that @xmath110 follows from selfridge s lower bound @xcite . finally , that no other integers occur as @xmath3 for any @xmath1 follows from part ( 3 ) .",
    "we also recall the definitions made for discussing the above :    a number @xmath111 is called _ stable _ if @xmath112 holds for every @xmath25 , or equivalently if @xmath113 for every @xmath8 .",
    "otherwise it is called _",
    "unstable_.    a natural number @xmath1 is called a _ leader _ if it is the smallest number with a given defect . by part ( 5 ) of theorem  [ oldprops ] , this is equivalent to saying that either @xmath114 , or , if @xmath115 , then @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 .    also ,",
    "because of part ( 6 ) of theorem  [ oldprops ] , we can make the following definitions :    [ dftseta ] for @xmath118 a congruence class modulo @xmath36 , we define @xmath119    we explicitly exclude the number @xmath11 here as it is dissimilar to other numbers whose complexity is congruent to @xmath11 modulo @xmath36 .",
    "this is because , unlike other numbers which are @xmath11 modulo @xmath36 , the number @xmath11 can not be written as @xmath120 for some @xmath121 , and so the largest number that can be made with a single @xmath11 is simply @xmath11 , rather than @xmath122 ( see appendix  [ secarias ] ) .",
    "for this reason , numbers of complexity @xmath11 do not really go together with other numbers whose complexity is congruent to @xmath11 modulo @xmath36 ; however , the only such number is @xmath11 , so we simply explicitly exclude it .",
    "so @xmath6 is the disjoint union of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath123 .    of course",
    ", we care not just about small defects , but about the numbers giving rise to those small defects ; so we recall the following definitions :    for any real @xmath124 , define the set of _ @xmath125-defect numbers _ @xmath126 to be @xmath127 define the set of _ @xmath125-defect leaders _ @xmath128 to be @xmath129    these sets are related by :    [ arbr ] for every @xmath130 , there exists a unique @xmath131 and @xmath66 such that @xmath132 and @xmath103 ; then @xmath133 .",
    "the first part of this is proposition 16(2 ) from @xcite .",
    "the second part follows as then @xmath134      in addition to the above properties of the defect , there are two substantive theorems we will need from @xcite .",
    "they allow us to inductively build up the sets @xmath126 and @xmath128 , or at least coverings of these .",
    "the first provides the base case :    [ finite ] for every @xmath97 with @xmath135 , the set of leaders @xmath136 is a finite set .",
    "the other theorem provides the inductive step , telling us how to build up @xmath137 from previous @xmath138 . in order to state it",
    "we ll first need some definitions .",
    "we say @xmath1 is _ most - efficiently _ represented as @xmath139 if @xmath140 and @xmath141 , or as @xmath142 if @xmath143 and @xmath141 .",
    "in the former case we will also say that @xmath140 is a _ good factorization _ of @xmath1 .",
    "we say @xmath1 is _ solid _ if it can not be written most - efficiently as @xmath142 for any @xmath118 and @xmath144 .",
    "we say @xmath1 is _ m - irreducible _ if it can not be written most - efficiently as @xmath139 for any @xmath118 and @xmath144 . and for a real number @xmath145",
    ", we define the set @xmath146 to consist of @xmath11 together with those @xmath111-irreducible numbers @xmath1 which satisfy @xmath147 and do not satisfy @xmath148 for any solid numbers @xmath144 with @xmath149 .",
    "note that for any @xmath135 , the set @xmath146 is a finite set , due to the upper bound on the size of numbers @xmath150 .",
    "now we can state the theorem .",

    ", we will show how to group the output of these theorems into tractable families , allowing us to go beyond the earlier work of this author and zelinsky @xcite and prove the main theorem .",

    ", it makes sense to make the following definition :    we define a _ stable defect _ to be the defect of a stable number , and define @xmath69 to be the set of all stable defects .",

    "this double use of the word `` stable '' could potentially be ambiguous if we had a positive integer @xmath1 which were also a defect .",
    "however , the only positive integer which is also a defect is @xmath11 , which is not stable in either sense",

    "@xmath620 $ ] and @xmath613 $ ] , theorem  [ thmsmall ] and ( 3 ) together with proposition  [ closure ] imply these have order type @xmath560 . and since by proposition  [ closure ] , for @xmath557 the sets @xmath621 $ ] and @xmath622 $ ] has order type less than @xmath10 , the @xmath10th element must be @xmath15 itself .",
    "we can also re state this result in the following way :    we have :    1 .   for @xmath8 ,",
    "the @xmath10th elements of @xmath558 and @xmath604 are both @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath612 , this is also true of @xmath610 and @xmath623 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath66 ,",
    "the supremum of the initial @xmath10 elements of @xmath6 is @xmath15 , and so is that of the initial @xmath10 elements of @xmath69 . if @xmath612 , then this is also true of @xmath64 and @xmath606 .",
    "part ( 1 ) is just theorem  [ thmfinal ] .",
    "part ( 2 ) , for @xmath8 , is theorem  [ thmfinal ] and corollary  [ limitvsclos ] .",
    "for @xmath555 , this is just the observation that @xmath244 is the intial element of @xmath6 and so also of @xmath69 , @xmath61 , and @xmath70 ( since these all contain @xmath244 ) .",
    "so we have now exhibited sixteen particular sets of defects that are well - ordered with order type @xmath7 : @xmath6 , @xmath69 , the closures of these sets , and for @xmath585 , the sets @xmath64 , @xmath606 , and their closures .",
    "we leave it for future work to resolve which of these sets are distinct .",

    "the author thanks j.  c.  lagarias for help with editing and for suggesting references .",

    "he is grateful to joshua zelinsky for much helpful discussion at the initial stages of this work .",
    "in his paper `` complejidad de los nmeros naturales , '' @xcite juan arias de reyna proposed a series of conjectures about integer complexity .",
    "these conjectures also proposed a structure to integer complexity described by ordinal numbers , but using a different language .",
    "these conjectures make assertions similar in spirit to some of the above results . below",
    "we prove modified versions of his conjectures 5 through 7 .",
    "the conjectures deal with the quantity @xmath624 , which is related to ( in fact , determined by ) the quantity @xmath3 .",
    "we recall first the formula for the largest number writable with @xmath15 ones which was proved by selfridge ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so for @xmath21 , within each congruence class of @xmath0 modulo @xmath36 , the quantity @xmath624 is also a one - to - one and order - reversing function of @xmath3 , being the same as @xmath629 up to a constant factor .",
