    "the formation of strongly interacting matter at supranuclear energy densities has recently been studied in great detail in nuclear reactions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "the analysis of the data collected in these experiments @xcite has shown that the matter flows very rapidly at the moment of its breakup into free - streaming hadrons .",
    "the collective flow also exhibits a large anisotropy in non - central collisions , characterized by the `` elliptic '' flow parameter @xmath0 .",
    "these observations are commonly understood to imply that ( i ) the quark and gluon matter undergoes rapid equilibration with thermalization times smaller than 1 fm/@xmath1 @xcite , and ( ii ) the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) maintains low shear viscosity @xmath2 not much larger than the conjectured lower bound @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the entropy density @xcite .",
    "this has led to the claim that the quark gluon plasma formed at rhic is the most perfect liquid known in nature @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture still has some uncertainties .",
    "the predictions of hydrodynamic simulations , especially for the flow anisotropy in off - central collisions , depend on the assumed transverse density profile @xcite .",
    "moreover , the possible role of contributions to transverse flow from the pre - equilibrium phase of the reaction is not settled .",
    "most hydrodynamic calculations assume that no transverse flow is present at the time of initialization , usually chosen in the range @xmath5 fm/@xmath1 after the onset of the reaction , although there are good reasons to believe that transverse pressure gradients existing at earlier times will contribute to the generation of collective flow even if the parton momentum distribution is still anisotropic @xcite .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that further complications could come from the bulk viscosity @xmath6 of quark and gluon matter near the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "bulk viscosity can be neglected compared to shear viscosity in many systems in nature .",
    "this was also shown to be true in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high temperature and weak coupling where @xmath7 @xcite while @xmath8 @xcite . the difference can be traced back to the near conformal invariance of qcd at high temperature .",
    "near the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath9 , however , qcd is far from being conformal , as can be inferred from the large peak of the `` interaction measure '' @xmath10 at @xmath9 found in lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the bulk viscosity over the entropy density , @xmath11 , on the lattice ( in the quenched approximation ) was recently found @xcite to exhibit a narrow peak around @xmath9 of order unity with @xmath12 .",
    "the bulk viscosity can also be related directly to the trace anomaly of the energy momentum tensor , and an estimate can thereby be obtained from lattice results for the interaction measure @xcite .",
    "the large spike of the bulk viscosity near @xmath9 immediately raises several questions @xcite which we want to address here .",
    "however , we also want to take a look at the larger picture .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics requires complete thermalization of the matter .",
    "isotropization of the pressure @xmath13 and consistency with the equation of state @xmath14 are necessary conditions for equilibrium .",
    "viscous hydrodynamics permits certain kinds of small deviations from equilibrium . in the local rest frame , shear stress @xmath15 describes deviations from isotropy of the stress tensor while bulk stress @xmath16 measures deviations from the equilibrium equation of state . in the second - order formulation of viscous hydrodynamics @xcite ,",
    "the deviations of the stress tensor from its equilibrium form are not prescribed by external strains , such as flow shear or flow divergence , but can be independently given and only relax to the externally forced values over time .",
    "the fireball produced in a relativistic nuclear collision starts out with highly anisotropic particle distributions and therefore a large pressure anisotropy , which may not be related to the imprinted flow field .",
    "it is thus useful to explore how the hydrodynamical evolution responds to different initial deviations from local equilibrium .",
    "it is not always obvious how large the deviations can be before the hydrodynamical approximation fails . in principle , viscous corrections extend the reach of hydrodynamics in relativistic heavy ion collisions to earlier times , but the gradient expansion of the stress tensor may break down @xcite . similarly , a large bulk viscosity @xmath6 around @xmath9 could mean that the matter is driven far from equilibrium around the phase transition and may even develop dynamical instabilities @xcite .",
    "it has also been claimed @xcite that bulk stress could contribute significantly to entropy production , with possibly profound consequences for the hadronization mechanism at @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , one expects the viscous bulk pressure @xmath17 to be negative for an expanding system ( @xmath18 to first order in gradients ) , implying that the effect of bulk viscosity is to slow down the expansion of the system .",
    "this should be most relevant in the longitudinal direction where the pressure is also reduced by the viscous shear stress .",
    "hence , one expects the system to spend more time around @xmath9 than predicted by ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "this leads to yet another interesting prospect : perhaps the evolution of the system is more sensitive to the equation of state near @xmath9 and the order of the phase transition than one would expect from ideal hydrodynamics where the relation of the phase transition to observables has been found to be rather obscure @xcite .    here , want to explore these questions in a hydrodynamic model with a simple space - time structure , but realistic equation of state , and bulk and shear viscosities motivated by lattice qcd .",
    "our framework is a one - dimensional boost - invariant fireball with translational and rotational symmetries in the transverse plane as first described by bjorken @xcite .",
    "we discuss the time evolution of the components of the pressure using second order hydrodynamics .",
    "our treatment is comparable to that of baym @xcite and heiselberg and wang @xcite , who explored deviations from , and the approach to , equilibrium in a boost - invariant expansion in the framework of the relaxation time approximation to the boltzmann equation .",
    "we will also explore the consequences of several different assumptions about the initial longitudinal and transverse pressure .",
    "let us rephrase our catalog of questions in the context of our hydrodynamic model : ( i ) how far from the equilibrium pressure @xmath13 is the longitudinal pressure @xmath19 throughout the evolution and in particular at the phase transition ?",
    "( ii ) how close to isotropy is the pressure tensor , i.e. how large is @xmath20 ?",
    "( iii ) what is the amount of entropy @xmath21 produced by the bulk viscosity compared to contributions from shear viscosity @xmath22 during the lifetime of the fireball ?",
    "we are aware that the simplified treatment with 1-dimensional expansion has several limitations .",
    "this approximation does not permit us to explore effects related to the transverse expansion and the more rapid cooling coming from it .",
    "we also can not treat the flow anisotropy in the transverse plane seen in off - central collisions . since boost - invariant hydrodynamics tends to overestimate the time required for the matter to cool below @xmath9 it makes our study conservative in the sense that the effects of the bulk viscosity are underestimated , compared with those expected in a full three - dimensional treatment .",
    "in the center of the fireball in a nuclear collision the viscous stress - energy tensor in the local comoving frame has the form @xcite : @xmath23 with the transverse and longitudinal pressure @xmath24 here @xmath13 denotes the ( isotropic ) pressure in thermal equilibrium , @xmath25 and @xmath17 denote the non - equilibrium contributions to the pressure coming from shear and bulk stress . in particular , the traceless shear tensor in that frame takes the form @xmath26 consistent with the symmetries in the transverse directions .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for more details .    at early times , @xmath25 and @xmath17 will be given by the initial conditions for the stress tensor established by the mechanisms of energy and momentum deposition in the nuclear collision . reflecting the dilution effect of the expansion on the local longitudinal momentum distribution of partons ,",
    "the pressure components are expected to satisfy the ordering @xmath27 one can argue that the largest physically meaningful value of @xmath25 at a time @xmath28 is @xmath29 , which corresponds to @xmath30 . such a negative value of the longitudinal pressure arises , for example , when the matter is completely in the form of coherent longitudinal fields at very early times @xcite .",
    "however , such a configuration is very far from equilibrium and the hydrodynamic approximation is surely invalid .",
    "once decoherence of the field is reached at a time @xmath31 the components of the physical pressure should be positive : @xmath32 .",
    "we want to explore various scenarios for the time evolution of @xmath25 and @xmath17 , assuming initial values satisfying @xmath33 at the start time of the hydrodynamic evolution @xmath34 .    in first - order ( navier - stokes ) dissipative hydrodynamics the bulk and shear stress",

    "obviously , larger relaxation times lead to increased entropy production and larger deviations from equilibrium .",
    "this is very clear for the shear contributions at early times .",
    "the effect of different relaxation times seems to be very much suppressed for the bulk stress .",
    "in fact , after @xmath119 fm/@xmath1 we again see a universal evolution of the system for fixed bulk viscosity . as expected the additional conformal terms in ( [ eq : evol2 ] ) lead to a suppression of the shear stress which manifests itself in a rapid relaxation away from the maximum anisotropic initial condition . enforcing conformal",
    "symmetry leads to smaller anisotropies between the transverse and longitudinal direction and the system is generally closer to equilibrium .",
    "this agrees with the recent observation of song and heinz @xcite made in the context of a study of two - dimensional boost invariant hydrodynamics including transverse expansion .",
    "we can now answer some of the questions posed at the beginning of the paper .",
    "first , independent of the initial conditions we find that the longitudinal pressure reaches at most half of the equilibrium pressure throughout the entire lifetime of the quark - gluon plasma phase if the bulk viscosity is close to the values suggested by lattice qcd ( @xmath120 ) , even if the shear viscosity takes its minimum value @xmath121 .",
    "this keeps the system away from equilibrium and reduces the work done in the longitudinal expansion .",
    "bulk stress is the main contribution to this effect after about 2 fm/@xmath1 and we find that the evolution of the system after this time , for a given equation of state at equilibrium , is solely determined by the value of the bulk viscosity and largely independent of the initial conditions and relaxation times .",
    "scaling our lattice inspired bulk viscosity with factors @xmath122 leads to unacceptably small or even negative longitudinal pressure which would indicate a breakdown of the hydrodynamic picture .",
    "these results remain qualitatively unchanged if the width of the peak in the kinematic bulk viscosity is varied by a factor of two .",
    "we also found that isotropization of the stress tensor proceeds rather slowly with @xmath123 as large as 20% around @xmath9 .",
    "it was recently pointed out by martinez and strickland @xcite that the anisotropy of the stress tensor of the quark - gluon plasma may be observable via changes in the dilepton yield . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong reduction in the relative longitudinal pressure , which may even lead to negative values of @xmath19 near @xmath9 , is reminiscent of a first - order phase transition , where the negative pressure is avoided by the formation of a mixed phase . under favorable conditions ,",
    "the delay of the expansion caused by mixed phase formation can be observed as a directional dependence of the identical - particle correlation function in density interferometry @xcite .",
    "the scenario found here may show similar effects , but differs from the traditional one by the anisotropy of the stress tensor caused by the continued presence of the shear viscosity .",
    "a realistic exploration of the influence of the bulk viscosity on identical particle correlations will the require the hydrodynamical treatment of the transverse expansion including both , bulk and shear viscosity .",
    "on the other hand , we find that bulk stress has a rather modest impact on entropy production , contrary to some previous expectations .",
    "for the parametrization @xmath112 considered here ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath91 ) the entropy increase due to the bulk viscosity is at most 10% of the final entropy .",
    "the reason is that the velocity gradients due to the longitudinal expansion have decreased significantly when the fireball approaches @xmath9 .",
    "this can also be easily seen by noting that we have only shown bulk and shear stress _ relative _ to the equilibrium pressure . while those are comparable , by the time the maximum in @xmath99 around @xmath9",
    "is reached the pressure @xmath13 has dropped significantly and the _ absolute _ values of @xmath17 are much smaller than the values of @xmath25 reached at times smaller than 1 fm/@xmath1 .",
    "a bulk viscosity much larger than indicated by our extrapolation of the existing lattice qcd results ( represented here by scale factors @xmath124 ) would be necessary to dominate entropy production after decoherence .",
    "this statement is independent of the initial condition for the bulk stress .",
    "non - linear terms in the evolution of the shear stress , dictated by conformal symmetry , suppress the shear stress and lead to reduced anisotropies and entropy production .",
    "however , these effects are not large enough to affect the conclusions drawn above qualitatively .    to summarize , large bulk viscosities around @xmath9 lead to prolonged deviations from equilibrium that could be sizable throughout the entire lifetime of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "bulk viscosities just slightly larger than currently favored could easily lead to a breakdown of the hydrodynamic approximation around @xmath9 .",
    "the decreased pressure should slow down the expansion of the system and increase the time spent in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "however , the amount of entropy produced through bulk stress around @xmath9 is smaller than that produced by shear stress at earlier stages of the evolution and thus does not result in a large increase of the final particle multiplicity , unless the bulk viscosity is much larger than that considered here .    _ acknowledgments : _ we thank the members of the yukawa institute of theoretical physics for their hospitality during the yipqs molecule _",
