    "one of the primary goals of flavor physics is to determine the angle @xmath2 of the @xmath8 ckm triangle @xcite . aside from being the least well known angle of the unitarity triangle ( ut )",
    ", it can be determined in tree - level processes that have negligible contributions from beyond the standard model physics , unlike most other constraints on the ut @xcite . therefore , any disagreement between the tree - level measurement of @xmath2 with predictions derived from other measurements is a signature of new physics .    the most promising decay to determine @xmath2 at tree level is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a @xmath0 or @xmath11 decaying to the same final state @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath2 arises from the interference between the decay @xmath12 and the color and ckm - suppressed decay @xmath13 .",
    "the most precise measurements @xcite of @xmath2 come from decays where @xmath14 @xcite . here , @xmath15 is @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "other promising @xmath10 final states are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "all these measurements depend on parameters related to the decay of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath21-decay parameters _ a priori _ can greatly improve the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "these proceedings summarise the measurements @xcite of these parameters made by the cleo collaboration and estimates their impact on the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath2 in @xmath23 comes from studying differences between the @xmath14 dalitz plot for both @xmath24 and @xmath25 decays .",
    "current measurements of @xmath2 require a model of the @xmath14 dalitz plot , which is derived from flavor - tagged samples of @xmath26 .",
    "the assumptions used to determine the model introduce a systematic uncertainty on @xmath2 which is estimated to be between @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this is significantly less than the current statistical uncertainty but it will be a limiting factor in future measurements @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to perform the measurement in a model - independent manner .",
    "such a method was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and has been developed significantly by bondar and poluektov @xcite .",
    "the method requires determining yields in bins of the @xmath14 dalitz plot for @xmath24 and @xmath25 decay , which depend on the @xmath3-decay parameters and two new parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which are the amplitude - weighted averages over the bin of the cosine and sine of the difference in strong - phase difference , @xmath31 , between dalitz - plot points @xmath32 and @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the invariant - mass of the @xmath35 pair .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that between 80% to 90% of the statistical sensitivity to @xmath2 of the unbinned method can be obtained by choosing bins corresponding to equal intervals of @xmath31 according to an amplitude model .",
    "an example of such a binning is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binning ] .     in region of similar @xmath36.[fig : binning ] ]    the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be measured in quantum - correlated @xmath37 decays of the @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath37 are produced in a @xmath39 state .",
    "therefore , if one @xmath21 meson decays to a @xmath40-eigenstate the other @xmath21-meson is in the opposite @xmath40-eigenstate .",
    "the difference between @xmath40-even and @xmath40-odd tagged dalitz plots in each bin is related to the @xmath29 parameters .",
    "in addition , the dalitz plot of quantum - correlated events where both @xmath21-mesons decay to @xmath41 is sensitive to both @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the strong - phase parameters for the decay @xmath42 ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) are closely related to @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that using decays of the type @xmath41 @xmath45 @xmath46 greatly improve the precision on @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the cleo - c experiment @xcite collected @xmath47 data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 818  pb@xmath48 .",
    "the fact that all particles arise from @xmath21-meson decay in the final state leads to both @xmath21 mesons being reconstructed exclusively with high efficiency and purity . for @xmath4 ( @xmath5 )",
    "decay the numbers of cp - tagged and @xmath49 @xmath45 @xmath49 candidates selected are 1661 and 1674 ( 219 and 335 ) , respectively .",
    "a maximum - likelihood fit is performed to the bin yields of the @xmath40-tagged and @xmath49 @xmath45 @xmath49 events to extract @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the results are presented in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are determined for several binning variations for both @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these binnings allow flexibility given different scenarios for the amount of @xmath3 data and the background environment .",
    "the measured values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are found to be in reasonable agreement with the values predicted by the amplitude models presented in refs .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainties arise from the modelling of the background . however",
    ", none of these measurements are systematically limited .",
    "the rate of decays @xmath57 is particularly sensitive to @xmath2 because the two interfering amplitudes are of similar size due to the doubly - cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) @xmath0 decay coming from the favored @xmath24 amplitude @xcite .",
    "the rate depends not only on @xmath2 but on the strong - phase difference between the cabibbo - favored and dcs @xmath58 decays .",
    "the measurement of this parameter by the cleo collaboration is described elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .    via the same mechanism",
    "there is potential sensitivity to @xmath2 from @xmath9 , where @xmath59 or @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "these modes have significantly larger branching fractions than @xmath58 @xcite",
    ". however , the dynamics are more complicated because there is variation of the strong - phase difference over the multi - body phase - space .",
    "this leads to the introduction of a new parameter referred to as the coherence factor @xmath61 ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) , which multiplies the interference term sensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath61 can vary between zero and one .",
    "if there is only a single intermediate resonance or a few non - interfering resonances the coherence factor will be close to one and the decay will behave just like @xmath64 .",
    "if there are many overlapping intermediate resonances the coherence factor will tend toward zero , limiting the sensitivity to @xmath2 .",
    "however , even if there is limited sensitivity to the phases when @xmath65 there is enhanced sensitivity to the magnitude of the amplitude ratio between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 decays ; improved knowledge of this parameter will then lead to better overall sensitivity to @xmath2 in a global fit to all @xmath9 decays .",
    ", @xmath66 , and @xmath67 allowed regions of ( @xmath68,@xmath69 ) parameter space.[fig : coherence ] ]    the values of @xmath61 and the average - strong phase difference @xmath70 have been measured by cleo - c @xcite .",
    "sensitivity comes from the quantum - correlated @xmath37 events with @xmath71 tagged by either @xmath40-eigenstates or @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , where the tag kaon charge is the same as the signal .",
    "a @xmath72 fit to the yields gives : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : coherence ] shows the @xmath77 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 regions of @xmath78 parameter space ; the coherence of @xmath79 is clearly observed .",
    "the impact of these results on the measurements of @xmath2 is discussed in the following section .",
    "the determination of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 in quantum - correlated @xmath21-decay allows the measurement of @xmath2 without a model induced systematic uncertainty .",
    "however , this is replaced by uncertainty due to the limited statistics used to measure @xmath29 and @xmath30 at cleo - c .",
    "this uncertainty is estimated to be between @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 and @xmath81 ) depending on the binning of the @xmath83 ( @xmath55 ) dalitz plot .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on @xmath2 can be reduced by about a factor of three if bes - iii collects @xmath84 of integrated luminosity at the @xmath38 resonance @xcite .",
    "this would reduce the uncertainty to the order of @xmath85 , which would not only be adequate for lhcb but also for future higher luminosity facilities @xcite .",
    "the impact of the measurements of @xmath61 and @xmath70 at lhcb is evaluated using the yield estimates for @xmath86 and @xmath87 decays in a dataset corresponding to @xmath88 of integrated luminosity at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the yield of @xmath90 is assumed to be half that of @xmath87 with the same level of background reflecting the difficulties associated with @xmath91 reconstruction in the hadronic environment .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath2 from lhcb data alone is @xmath92 . including the cleo - c constraints on @xmath61 and @xmath70 this improves to @xmath93 .",
    "the introduction of the cleo - c constraints is equivalent to @xmath94 more lhcb data .",
    "this clearly illustrates the power of quantum - correlated measurements in aiding the determination of @xmath2 .",
    "bes - iii data could lead to at least a further 10% reduction of the uncertainty on @xmath2 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the first quantum - correlated measurements of strong - phase parameters of @xmath21-decay at cleo - c have been presented and their positive impact on the determination of @xmath2 at lhcb has been illustrated .",
    "further improvements are possible by exploiting the larger sample of quantum - correlated decays that will be available at bes - iii",
    ". furthermore , there are other @xmath10 decay modes of interest to the measurement of @xmath2 for which the strong - phase parameters have yet to be determined : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
