    "slab gel electrophoresis has long been a familiar technique in molecular biology for sorting biomolecules according to their size and charge .",
    "for example , the sanger method of sequencing dna and rna uses gel electrophoresis for sorting the products of the chain termination reaction . the sds - page technique used for sorting proteins by size uses electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel to separate the surfactant coated amino acid chains resulting from the denaturing of the proteins .",
    "the technique of capillary electrophoresis ( ce ) was introduced about thirty years ago and has largely replaced gel electrophoresis in many modern applications . in ce , the sample migrates through a microcapillary ( about 50 @xmath0 m in diameter and tens of centimeters long ) instead of a slab of porous gel .",
    "the micro - capillary is connected at the inlet and at the outlet to reservoirs , as shown in the schematic sketch in figure  [ fig:0 ] and the entire system is filled with an electrolytic buffer  @xcite . a large electrical voltage ( tens of kilovolts ) is applied with electrodes between the inlet and outlet reservoirs .",
    "the sample separates into distinct zones based on the migration speeds of individual components in the applied electric field . a detector placed near",
    "the outlet records a series of peaks ( an electropherogram ) that may be used for analyzing the sample .",
    "often ( but not always ) there is an electroosmotic flow  @xcite present in the capillary that causes both positive and negative ions to be swept past a single detector placed near the outlet . for linear polyelectrolytes ( e.g. dna )",
    "the mobility is insensitive to the polymer length . in such cases a sieving medium such as a polyacrylamide gel",
    "may be loaded into the micro - capillary .",
    "ce has many advantages over the traditional slab gel electrophoresis method , one of the most important ones being ease of parallelization .",
    "since many ce channels can be etched on a single substrate , multiple separations can be run simultaneously .",
    "such scalability is critical to applications such as genome sequencing , and indeed ce is the method of choice in most such applications . though ce is generally considered superior to the more traditional gel electrophoresis methods one of its limitations is the high demands placed on the sensitivity of the photo detector .",
    "the detector , which consists of a uv or laser source coupled to a photo cell must be sensitive to light attenuation over very short optical path lengths ( the capillary diameter ) .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize the likelihood of detection , it is preferable to use high sample concentrations .",
    "this requirement however conflicts with the other requirement of ce which is to minimize peak broadening or dispersion in order to improve resolution and signal strength  @xcite .",
    "the conflict is caused by a phenomenon known as `` electromigration dispersion '' or the `` sample overloading effect '' .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism is well understood and may be roughly explained as follows : when the concentration of sample ions is non - negligible compared to that of the background electrolytes the local electrical conductivity ( @xmath1 ) is altered in the vicinity of the peak . on the other hand , since the current ( @xmath2 ) is constant , the electric field ( @xmath3 ) must change locally since by ohm s law @xmath4 .",
    "this varying electric field alters the effective migration speed of the sample ( or analyte ) ion which in turn alters its concentration distribution thereby giving rise to a nonlinear transport problem that must be solved in a self consistent manner .",
    "electromigration dispersion causes highly asymmetric concentration profiles , high rates of dispersion and shock like structures that are reminiscent of nonlinear waves seen in many other physical systems .",
    "these effects have been widely reported in the literature on electrophoresis ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "simple one dimensional mathematical models of electromigration dispersion have been constructed  @xcite by invoking the assumption of vanishing diffusivity of all species and the requirement of local charge neutrality , which for a three ion system yields a single nonlinear hyperbolic equation .",
    "solutions describe the observed steepening of an intitially smooth profile leading to subsequent shock formation .",
    "two recent reviews  @xcite provide more extensive references to one dimensional models and the behavior of their solutions as evident from numerical simulations .",
    "these models assume that only strong electrolytes are involved so that the valence states of the constituent ions are fixed .",
    "this assumption is inadequate when ampholytes ( such as proteins ) are present .",
    "the separation of ampholytes is usually performed by exploiting two other modes of electrophoresis : isotachophoresis and isoelectric focusing .",
    "the mode of electrophoresis described in the introduction and discussed in this paper by contrast is called `` zone electrophoresis '' . from a mathematical perspective",
    "the various modes of electrophoresis correspond to different kinds of initial and boundary conditions of the same governing equations .",
    "an excellent discussion of the mathematical problem involved in the various modes of electrophoresis may be found in chapter  3 of the book by fife  @xcite and the practical aspects are discussed in a number of text books  @xcite .",
    "the essential technique for reducing the complexity of the transport equations in the presence of ampholytes was developed by saville and palusinski  @xcite using the well founded assumption that the time scale associated with ionization phenomena is very short compared to the time scale of diffusive or electrophoretic transport .",
    "thus , local equilibrium may be assumed to exist between the ampholyte and its dissociation products so that the concentrations of the various charged states can be algebraically related to the concentration of the ampholyte in the neutral state . a historically contentious issue and an area of some mathematical interest concerns the assumption of local charge neutrality mentioned earlier .",
    "local charge neutrality results when the small parameter ( in some appropriate dimensionless formulation ) multiplying the laplacian of the potential in poisson s equation vanishes .",
    "this assumption , first invoked by planck  @xcite , results in a singular perturbation problem leading to boundary layers and associated interesting physics in various areas including semiconductor junctions and in selectively permeable membranes  @xcite . in the context of electrophoresis , the singular nature of the local charge neutrality assumption is manifested at the sharp boundaries of isotachophoretic shocks where the shock is regularized by finiteness of the small parameter .",
    "this aspect has been studied by fife  @xcite who also presented some results relating to the regularity of solutions .",
    "a proof of the global existence of solutions for the coupled species and electric field equations in one dimension in the absence of ampholytes have been presented by avrin  @xcite . in the present paper , we consider the one dimensional model of electromigration dispersion in the absence of ampholytes , however , we replace the assumption of zero ionic diffusivities with one of equal diffusivity of the ionic constituents . we show that this simple modification leads to a nonlinear advection - diffusion equation which reduces to burgers equation for the analyte concentration if this concentration is not too large .",
    "the wealth of information that is available about the burgers equation can thereby be exploited for understanding electromigration dispersion .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath5 ionic species and denote by @xmath6 the number of ions of species @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) present per unit volume . here",
    "@xmath9 is the direction along the capillary and @xmath10 is time .",
    "the system is presumed one dimensional , that is , the dependent variables are assumed not to vary over the cross - section of the capillary . in particular , this implies , electroosmotic flow , if present , is of the `` plug flow '' type .",
    "cross stream variations can and do arise in ce and have been widely studied but it is not central to the present discussion .",
    "the concentrations obey the equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the flux ( amount passing per unit area of cross section per unit time ) of species @xmath7 . in writing eq .",
    "( [ conserve_i ] ) we have presumed that there are no sources or sinks for the ions . in particular , ionization and recombination phenomena are ignored , which is justified if only strong electrolytes are involved .",
    "the fluxes @xmath12 are related to the concentration fields through the nerst - planck model @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electric field ( directed along the capillary ) , @xmath15 is the electrophoretic mobility and @xmath16 is the diffusivity of the ` @xmath7th ' species .",
    "in addition to the electrophoretic mobility , which is the velocity acquired by the ion per unit of applied electric field , we would also refer to the mobility ( @xmath17 ) which is the velocity per unit applied force .",
    "the two are related to each other as @xmath18 and related to the diffusivity through the stokes - einstein relation  @xcite @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath21 is the absolute temperature , @xmath22 denotes the proton charge and @xmath23 is the signed valence of the @xmath7th species which can be positive , negative or zero .",
    "when fluid flow with velocity @xmath24 is present , a term @xmath25 is added to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ nerst - planck ] ) . however , if the flow is an electroosmotic plug flow , this term may be absorbed in the second term by simply redefining @xmath15 as the `` total '' instead of the  electrophoretic \" mobility .",
    "if the capillary is filled with a polymer network then the mobility and diffusivity introduced above should be interpreted as the `` effective '' values of these quantities in the porous medium and the dependent variables must be regarded as averages of the corresponding physical quantity over the cross - section of the capillary .",
    "the system of equations eq .",
    "( [ conserve_i ] ) - ( [ nerst - planck ] ) is closed by poisson s equation of electrostatics , which in si units is written as @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the charge density and @xmath28 is the permittivity of the medium .",
    "time variations in electrophoresis are sufficiently slow that any errors resulting from replacement of the complete maxwell s equations of electromagnetism by poisson s equation , eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) , is negligible .",
    "( [ conserve_i ] )  ( [ poisson ] ) provide a closed system of equations for calculation of the time evolution of the functions @xmath29 if the initial conditions are known and if appropriate boundary conditions are specified .",
    "if ` @xmath30 ' denotes a characteristic length scale over which the concentrations may be considered to vary ( this may be taken , for example , as the peak width ) , then it may be shown that the ratio of the term on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) to that on the right is of the order of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the debye length in the buffer . since in ce , @xmath30 is of the order of microns while @xmath32 is in the nanometer range , @xmath31 is extremely small . as a result ,",
    "( [ poisson ] ) may be replaced by the electroneutrality condition : @xmath33 first invoked by planck  @xcite in the context of the problem of the liquid junction potential .",
    "this condition caused some confusion in the early history of the subject , since it appeared that in the absence of the charge density , no electric field , or in our problem , perturbation to the applied field is possible .",
    "the controversy was resolved  @xcite when it was realized that eq .",
    "( [ electroneutral ] ) should be interpreted in an asymptotic rather than in an exact sense .",
    "the disappearance of the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) may at first sight appear to be problematic because we have now lost our equation for determining @xmath3 .",
    "this is not in fact a difficulty as @xmath3 can be determined directly from ohm s law and the condition of the constancy of current : @xmath34 where the electrical conductivity is @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a constant .",
    "the first of the two equalities in eq  ( [ ohm ] ) is a consequence of charge neutrality but the second requires certain additional assumptions . to see this , substitute @xmath12 from eq .",
    "( [ nerst - planck ] ) in the expression for the current @xmath37   + e \\sum_{i=1}^{n }   \\mu_{i } z_{i } e c_{i}. \\label{expressionj}\\ ] ] if the diffusive contributions are now neglected , then the second part of eq .",
    "( [ ohm ] ) , @xmath4 or ohm s law follows .",
    "the constraints imposed by eq .",
    "( [ electroneutral ] ) and ( [ ohm ] ) have the effect of replacing two of the differential equations governing the transport by algebraic relations .",
    "it was pointed out by kohlrausch  @xcite that a further reduction of the governing equations is possible if the diffusion terms are neglected in the ion transport equations . to see this we define the kohlrausch function : @xmath38 if we now take the derivative of both sides of this relation with respect to time and use eq .",
    "( [ conserve_i ] ) , ( [ nerst - planck ] ) and ( [ electroneutral ] ) we get @xmath39 if the right hand side is neglected we get @xmath40 and this provides an algebraic relation to replace one more differential equation for transport .",
    "in contrast to the electro - neutrality condition which is respected to high accuracy , the neglect of the diffusion terms in arriving at either ohm s law or the kohlrausch relation is questionable in applications related to ce .",
    "the ratio of the diffusive term to the other terms is measured by the inverse of the peclet number , @xmath41 in terms of the characteristic peak width @xmath30 and velocity @xmath42 .",
    "while it is true that the peclet number is generally large in the applications we are concerned with here , the transit times @xmath43 across the length ( @xmath44 ) of the capillary is also very long .",
    "thus , the ratio of the diffusive broadening ( @xmath45 ) to a characteristic peak width ( @xmath30 ) is measured by the square root of @xmath46 which is generally not small even though @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , when the profile steepens , as it does in electromigration dispersion , the second derivative term multiplying @xmath16 in the transport equations can become very large so that the diffusive term once again has a finite effect no matter how small the diffusivity is .",
    "nevertheless , the kohlrausch relations have been fruitfully applied for certain special situations such as in calculating fluxes across interfaces separating two homogeneous regions . in the next section",
    "we show how the ideas of kohlrausch and ohm s law can be generalized to treat the case of nonzero diffusivities .",
    "let us now consider an idealized model of electrophoresis where only three species are involved : a sample or analyte ion , a positive ion and a negative ion . in place of the suffix @xmath7 we will from now on use a suffix ` @xmath48 ' to denote the positive ion ,",
    "` @xmath49 ' to denote the negative ion and no suffix at all to indicate the sample .",
    "thus , @xmath50 is the signed valence of the positive ion , @xmath51 that of the negative ion and @xmath52 that of the sample . clearly @xmath50 is positive",
    ", @xmath51 is negative and @xmath52 could be of either sign ( but not zero , since a neutral species does not electromigrate ) .",
    "we will further assume that all the species have the same mobility ( @xmath53 ) , and therefore the same diffusivity @xmath54 , though their electrophoretric mobilities @xmath55 could be widely different .",
    "many analytes of importance in electrophoresis are linear polyelectrolytes , and for these molecules the charge scales linearly with the mass @xmath56 while the diffusivity scales roughly as @xmath57 . it might therefore be argued that diffusivities of ions vary over a relatively small range when compared to their electrophoretic mobilities , though it must be acknowledged that our primary motivation for introducing this assumption is the pragmatic one of wanting to reduce the mathematical complexity of the problem .",
    "it is readily seen that by virtue of our assumption @xmath58 and the electroneutrality condition eq .",
    "( [ electroneutral ] ) , the first term of eq .",
    "( [ expressionj ] ) vanishes so that ohm s law , eq  ( [ ohm ] ) is recovered .",
    "further , in view of our assumption of equal diffusivities , eq .  ( [ kohlrausch_eqn ] ) reduces to the diffusion equation @xmath59 which admits an analytical solution : @xmath60   \\ ; dy.\\ ] ] if @xmath61 denotes the unperturbed value of @xmath62 , then the perturbation in @xmath62 , @xmath63 spreads diffusively from the injection region so that its width , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the width of the peak at injection . the essential observation that allows us to extend kohlrausch s ideas to the diffusive case",
    "is illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] and it is the following : even though @xmath66 is in general a time dependent quantity , in the vicinity of the analyte peak we may assume it to be a constant equal to its unperturbed value @xmath67 .",
    "this is because the distance between the analyte peak and the injection zone ( @xmath68 ) increases linearly with time @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the applied field so that at long times , @xmath71 .",
    "the minimum length of time that needs to pass for this to happen is @xmath72 $ ] where @xmath73 is the velocity of an isolated analyte ion in the back ground electrolyte and @xmath74 $ ] indicates the larger of the two numbers within the brackets .",
    "it is instructive to express this in terms of the diffusion time @xmath75 the time it takes the analyte to diffuse over a characteristic distance .",
    "if we identify this characteristic distance with @xmath76 , that is , @xmath77 , then the condition may be written as @xmath78 $ ] where @xmath79 is the peclet number introduced earlier .",
    "if we use the estimates @xmath80 mm / s , @xmath81 @xmath0 m , @xmath82 @xmath83/s which are fairly typical , we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 s. thus , the condition @xmath67 in the vicinity of the analyte peak may be used with confidence for times @xmath86 s. this is indeed very small in comparison to the time interval between injection and detection which is tens of minutes . in simple terms ,",
    "@xmath87 spreads so slowly that the analyte peak leaves it behind essentially in the time it takes to traverse a distance of the order of its own width .    setting the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ kohlrauch ] ) to the constant value @xmath61 immediately yields a third algebraic relation in addition to eq .",
    "( [ electroneutral ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ohm ] ) between the set of four dependent variables : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath3 .",
    "if we use these to express all of the remaining variables in terms of @xmath90 and substitute in the transport equation for @xmath90 , we obtain , after some algebra that we omit , a single nonlinear partial differential equation describing the evolution of the analyte concentration @xmath90 .",
    "this equation may be conveniently expressed in terms of the dimensionless quantity @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the concentration of the negative ions in the background electrolyte : @xmath93 the dimensionless parameter @xmath94 is defined as @xmath95 since @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath94 is positive if @xmath0 is in the interval @xmath98 and is negative otherwise .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 is essentially a dimensionless form of the `` velocity slope parameter '' that has been used  @xcite to characterize electromigration dispersion , since @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the local value of the migrational velocity of an analyte ion within the sample zone .",
    "the concentrations of the negative and positive ions may be readily expressed in terms of @xmath101 using the charge neutrality condition , eq  ( [ electroneutral ] ) and the defining relation for @xmath66 , eq  ( [ kohlrauch ] ) : @xmath102 + \\frac{\\mu_p}{z_p - z_n } \\ , \\delta k , \\label{cn}\\ ] ] @xmath103 - \\frac{\\mu_n}{z_p - z_n } \\ , \\delta k. \\label{cp}\\ ] ] it is seen from the above equations that once the analyte has moved out of the injection zone ( @xmath104 ) the background ions do not immediately return to their equilibrium concentrations .",
    "a fluctuation is created in the concentration of the background ions which does not propagate , but decays in place on a diffusive time scale .",
    "if the capillary carries an electroosmotic flow and if the sensor is sensitive to the background ions ( e.g. a uv absorbance detector ) these fluctuations may be detected with the analyte peaks complicating the interpretation of the signal .",
    "the existence of these anomalous peaks are well known  @xcite and are variously referred to as `` water peaks '' , `` system peaks '' or `` vacancy peaks '' .",
    "when @xmath94 is positive , the evolution equation for @xmath101 , eq  ( [ eq4phi ] ) has a singularity at @xmath105 which needs to be understood .",
    "clearly , this singularity arises because of the vanishing of the conductivity @xmath1 in ohm s law eq  ( [ ohm ] ) . since @xmath55 , the vanishing of the conductivity when @xmath106 implies that one or both of the background ion concentrations must have become negative",
    "this , of course is physically impossible and would imply that at least one of our two assumptions , namely charge neutrality or constancy of the kohlrausch function would have to be violated before this singularity is reached .",
    "in fact , the highest analyte concentration to which eq  ( [ eq4phi ] ) may still be used can be calculated by requiring that both the conditions @xmath107 and @xmath108 be respected where @xmath89 and @xmath88 are given by eq .",
    "( [ cn ] ) and eq .",

    "if initial conditions are used such that @xmath118 in some regions , there will be an initial transient period that is not described by eq  ( [ eq4phi ] ) , but once diffusion causes the analyte concentration to drop below the critical value , the subsequent evolution should follow eq .",
    "( [ eq4phi ] ) .",
    "eq .  ( [ eq4phi ] ) in general describes a one dimensional nonlinear wave  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity arises because the local wave speed @xmath100 changes with @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath119 , larger values of @xmath101 correspond to higher speeds , so that if @xmath101 has a maximum at some point , then analyte ions near the maximum out runs the slower ions ahead of it causing the distribution of @xmath101 to lean forward and develop a sharp gradient at its leading edge ( a shock wave ) .",
    "an analogous situation arises if @xmath120 except in this case the distribution of @xmath101 leans backwards as seen in panels c and d of figure  3 . the diffusive term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq4phi ] ) works to counter the sharpening of the wave due to the nonlinearity .",
    "when it is dominant the wave approaches a gaussian shape in time with small departures from this limiting shape due to the nonlinearity . in case of small diffusivity",
    "the diffusive term is small everywhere except in the vicinity of the shock ; its presence prevents the sharp change in @xmath101 at the shock from evolving into a true mathematical discontinuity . in the remainder of this section we attempt to rationalize some of the observed facts about electromigration dispersion by exploiting some well known results from the mathematical theory of nonlinear waves .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath121 for all @xmath9 and @xmath10 . since @xmath101 is the ratio of analyte ion to that of the background ions , typically @xmath122 .",
    "the above condition can also be satisfied even when @xmath123 is not small compared to unity , provided @xmath124 is small , that is , if the electrophoretic mobility of the analyte ion closely matches that of one of the background electrolytes . in either case",
