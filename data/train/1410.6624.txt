    "the coupling constants of the three gauge interactions run with energy  @xcite .",
    "the ones relating to the nonabelian symmetries are relatively strong at low energy , but decrease , while the abelian interaction increases . at an energy comprised between @xmath8",
    "gev their values are very similar , around @xmath9 , but , in view of present data , and _ in absence of new physics _ , they fail to meet at a single scale . here by absence of new physics we mean extra terms in the lagrangian of the model",
    ". the extra terms may be due for example to the presence of new particles , or new interaction .",
    "a possibility could be supersymmetric models which can alter the running and cause the presence of the unification point  @xcite .",
    "the standard model of particle interaction coupled with gravity may be explained to some extent as a particular for of noncommutative , or spectral geometry , see for example  @xcite for a recent introduction .",
    "the principles of noncommutative geometry are rigid enough to restrict gauge groups and their fermionic representations , as well as to produce a lot of relations between bosonic couplings when applied on ( almost ) commutative spaces .",
    "all these restrictions and relations are surprisingly well compatible with the standard model , except that the higgs field comes out too heavy , and that the unification point of gauge couplings is not exactly found .",
    "we have nothing new to say about the first problem , which has been solved in @xcite with the introduction of a new scalar field @xmath10 suitably coupled to the higgs field , but we shall address the second one .",
    "some years ago the data were compatible with the presence of a single unification point @xmath11 .",
    "this was one of the motivations behind the building of grand unified theories .",
    "such a feature is however desirable even without the presence of a larger gauge symmetry group which breaks to the standard model with the usual mechanisms . in particular",
    ", the approach to field theory , based on noncommutative geometry and spectral physics  @xcite , needs a scale to regularize the theory . in this respect ,",
    "the finite mode regularization  @xcite is ideally suited . in this case",
    "@xmath11 is also the field theory cutoff .",
    "in fact using this regularization it is possible to generate the bosonic action starting form the fermionic one  @xcite , or describe induced gravity on an equal footing with the anomaly - induced effective action  @xcite    the aim of this paper is to investigate whether the presence of higher dimensional terms in the standard model action @xmath12 dimension six in particular @xmath12 may cause the unification of the coupling constants . the paper may be read in two contexts : as an application of the spectral action , or independently on it , from a purely phenomenologically point of view .    from the spectral point of view ,",
    "the spectral action  @xcite is solved as a heath kernel expansion in powers in the inverse of an energy scale .",
    "the terms up to dimension four reproduce the standard model qualitatively , but the theory is valid at a scale in which the couplings are equal .",
    "the expansion gives , however , also higher dimensional terms , suppressed by the power of the scale , and depending on the details of the cutoff .",
    "this fixes relations among the coefficients of the new terms .",
    "the analysis of this paper gives the conditions under which the spectral action can predict the unification of the three gauge coupling constants .    on the other side ,",
    "it is also possible to read the paper at a purely phenomenological level , using the spectral action as input only for the choice of the subset of all possible higher dimensions terms in the action , and as a guide for the setting of the low energy values for the couplings of the coefficients of the extra terms .",
    "we show that the presence of these terms enables the possibility of a unification .    in both cases",
    "the scale of unification @xmath11 is considered the cutoff , and we run the theory below it . we assume , therefore , that perturbation theory is valid .",
    "there appears a hierarchy problem . from the point of view of the spectral action",
    "this implies a rather strange ( though admissible ) cutoff function . from a phenomenological point of view",
    "this entails either unnaturally large dimensionless quantities , or the presence of a new intermediate scale , @xmath13 .",
    "the latter option is , of course , more desirable and we will discuss it below .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ smrcc ] , we present the action of standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , and the standard running coupling constants .",
    "we show how the spectral action approach @xmath12 whose principles are summarized in the appendix  [ appspectralaction ] @xmath12 fits the sm . in section  [ rges ]",
    "we give the new renormalization group equations at one loop , due to the dimensions-6 operators ; then , we show how these new operators affect the sm phenomenology . in section  [ rgf ]",
    "we run the renormalization group equations to study the new coupling constants behavior , checking the possibility to improve the gauge unification point .",
    "a final section contains conclusions and some comments and open questions .",
    "the standard model action ( including right handed neutrinos ) is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the field strengths associated with the gauge groups @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; the gauge covariant derivative is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the @xmath19 generators , @xmath22 are the @xmath23 generators , and y is the @xmath24 hypercharge generator .",
    "@xmath25 is the higgs field , a @xmath23 scalar doublet with hypercharge @xmath26 and its charged conjugated field defined as @xmath27 .",
    "the three families of fermions are grouped together so that @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the @xmath31 complex yukawa matrices acting on the hidden flavor index of every fermion field . since these matrices are dominated by the yukawa coupling @xmath32 of the top quark , in the following we will consider this parameter only .",
    "likewise we will consider a single mass term for the majorana masses : @xmath33 .",
    "this lagrangian can be obtained from first principles using the spectral action  @xcite , which is a regularized trace , with @xmath11 appearing as the cutoff .",
    "we give the details of the spectral action calculations in the appendix .",
    "for the economy of this paper the relevant part is the fact that the spectral action requires the coupling constants of the three gauge groups to be equal at a scale @xmath11 , which is also the cutoff of the theory .",
    "there is no need for a unified gauge group at the scale @xmath11 , which in fact may signify a phase transition to a pre geometric phase  @xcite , although larger symmetries are also possible  @xcite .",
    "as explained in the appendix , the spectral action is an expansion in inverse powers of @xmath34 , and it enables the presence of a set of new dimension six operators . dimension five operators , which violate lepton number , and do not change the properties of the higgs boson are not present in the expansion .",
    "the spectral action also gives relations among the coefficients of the required dimension six operators , which are described in detail in the appendix  [ appspectralaction ] .",
    "the reader interested only in the phenomenological aspect of this paper may skip the appendix , and accept our choice of operator as a convenient one .",
    "a complete classification of the dimension - six operators in the standard model is given in @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that there are 59 independent operators , preserving baryon number , after eliminating redundant operators using the equations of motion . here",
    "we consider only the following dimension - six operators , mixing the gauge field strength and the higgs field .",
    "they are the ones coming from the spectral action expansion : @xmath35 the coefficients @xmath36 have the dimension of an inverse energy square .",
    "the spectral action fixes their value at the cutoff @xmath11 . to these terms",
    "we have to add a coupling between the higgs , the @xmath37 and the @xmath38 which is absent in the spectral action at scale @xmath11 , but is dynamically created . with the couplings considered here no other term is induced .    the sm running coupling constants at one loop , associated to ( [ eq : sm lagrangian ] ) ,",
    "are ruled by the following equations , where we defined the dot derivations as @xmath39 : @xmath40 for the purposes of this paper one loop is sufficient , the running up to three loops can be found in  @xcite and references therein . in the present case ,",
    "one separately solves the equations for the gauge coupling constants and the other couplings ; for the former , the boundary conditions are given at the electro - weak scale by the experimental values @xcite , @xmath41 while for the other coupling constants @xmath42 and @xmath33 the boundary conditions are taken at the cut - off scale @xmath11 that is the scale at which the spectral action lives .",
    "these boundary conditions use the parameters of the fermions that are the inputs in the dirac operator  ( [ diracoperator ] ) , as shown in the appendix  [ appspectralaction ] , @xmath43 @xmath44 is a free parameter such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 . since the coupling constants @xmath47 do not meet exactly ,",
