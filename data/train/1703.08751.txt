    "central and upwind discretization schemes are the popular categories of numerical methods for simulating hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "a system is said to be hyperbolic if its jacobian matrix has all real eigenvalues with complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors .",
    "upwind schemes based on flux difference splitting ( fds ) are usually more accurate than others .",
    "two popular schemes belonging to this category are the approximate riemann solvers of roe @xcite and osher @xcite and these are heavily dependent on eigenvector structure . thus their applications are limited to systems which have complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors .",
    "several other numerical schemes too are dependent strongly on eigenstructure and thus share the same difficulty .",
    "recently , an attempt is made @xcite to extend roe scheme to weakly hyperbolic systems by adding a perturbation parameter @xmath0 to make such systems strictly hyperbolic . in this article",
    "we try to develop an upwind method based on the concept of flux difference splitting together with jordan forms , thus naming it as fds - j scheme , to simulate genuine weakly hyperbolic systems .",
    "we use the theory of jordan canonical forms to complete the defective set of linearly independent ( li ) eigenvectors .",
    "pressureless gas dynamics system , which happens to be weakly hyperbolic , is considered and it is known to produce delta shocks for density variable .",
    "next , we consider _ modified burgers system _ as given in @xcite and for this system too delta shocks occur exactly at same locations where normal shocks occur in the primary variables .",
    "similarly , other types of discontinuities , namely , @xmath1-shocks and @xmath2-shocks are observed if we further extend modified burgers system as given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "fds - j solver is capable of recognizing these shocks accurately .",
    "comparison is done with simple local lax - friendrichs ( llf ) @xcite method .",
    "contribution of generalized eigenvectors is not seen directly in the final fds - j scheme for simulating considered genuine weakly hyperbolic systems .",
    "it is because for each considered system , all eigenvalues are equal with arithmetic multiplicity ( am ) greater than one in the resulting single jordan block for each case .",
    "consider the one - dimensional pressure - less gas dynamics system @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the conserved variable vector and @xmath5 is the flux vector defined by @xmath6             \\rho u          \\end{bmatrix } \\",

    "sub - case @xmath23 : now , consider the case in which gm is strictly less than am , in that case the li set of eigenvectors will not be a complete one . here , we can pull in the theory of jordan canonical forms to recover full li set of generalized eigenvectors and to make given square matrix similar to a jordan matrix which is not much different from a diagonal matrix . +",
