    "since we expect that the centers of galaxies are occupied by supermassive black holes , relativistic binary systems with extreme mass ratios are of great interest . a first approximation to an extreme mass ratio inspiral ( emri ) is the geodesic motion where the spin of the smaller particle is ignored .",
    "more relevant models have to incorporate the spin .",
    "this , however , appears not to be so simple .",
    "the equations of motion of a spinning particle were given by mathisson @xcite and papapetrou @xcite several decades ago .",
    "the mathisson - papapetrou ( mp ) equations are not a closed set of first order ordinary differential equations , i.e. , there are less equations than necessary in order to evolve the system . to close the set , an extra spin supplementary condition ( ssc ) is required . over the years",
    ", various such sscs have been proposed ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .    as a ssc fixes a center of reference , e.g. ,",
    "the center of the mass , and different sscs define different centers , for each ssc we have a different world line ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and , hence , each ssc prescribes a different evolution of the mp equations .",
    "but , although this ambiguity appears to be a major issue in the modeling of an emri binary system , the difference in the evolution caused by different sscs has not received the adequate attention .",
    "our work aims at quantifying those evolution differences in a kerr spacetime background .",
    "the first part of the study addresses the above issue by examining how `` similar '' initial conditions diverge when they are evolved by using different sscs .",
    "we focus on two sscs , namely the tulczyjew ( t ) ssc @xcite and the newton - wigner(nw ) ssc @xcite , as introduced by barausse et al . in @xcite .",
    "t  ssc is a standard ssc that has been used in several works concerned with different topics , see , e.g. , @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "nw  ssc has been successfully implemented in the framework of the post - newtonian approximation @xcite , and it is the only ssc allowing for a canonical hamiltonian formalism , albeit only up to linear order in the spin of the particle in curved spacetimes .",
    "this hamiltonian formalism has been derived in  @xcite .",
    "as it has many practical advantages to have a hamiltonian formulation of a given problem at hand , for example because it is part of the effective one body formulation @xcite , it would be nice to see if orbits obtained via the hamiltonian formalism of  @xcite stay close to those obtained with the help of the full mp equations in the case of nw ssc ( a discussion on the topic can be found in sec .",
    "iv of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the second part of our work , we compare both approaches numerically .",
    "a numerical investigation of the equations considered in this work entails a bunch of interesting numerical challenges . to start with ,",
    "a useful study of the divergence of different orbits should straddle a reasonably long time interval .",
    "the efficient integration of equations of motion over a long time interval requires structure preserving algorithms ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for an elaborate overview ) such as symplectic schemes , which have been successfully applied for simulations in various fields of general relativity , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mp equations have no hamiltonian structure , wherefore one would expect usual symplectic integration schemes to lose their theoretical advantage over ordinary , not so efficient ones",
    ". what is more , in the nw  ssc case part of the equations of motion will turn out to be known only implicitly . in this work",
    "we will explain how , notwithstanding the just mentioned obstacles , the mp equations can be evolved accurately in an efficient way for both sscs .",
    "when comparing orbits calculated via the mp equations with those obtained by the hamiltonian equations of  @xcite , one is faced with the problem of different evolution parameters .",
    "we thus come up with a comfortable way of guaranteeing output at consistent times .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mpeqs ] we introduce the mp equations and give a brief discussion on the sscs .",

[ sec : tnwcom ] we explain how the simulations with the mp equations are done , and a comparison between the t and the nw  ssc is provided , whilst sec .

    "@xmath148 is one tenth of the spin measure right from the beginning , and stays at this level during the evolution .",
    "thus , from an orbital dynamic point of view when the spin of the test particle is of order @xmath136 , the choice of different sscs leads to orbital evolutions which diverge significantly with time .",
    "one thing that has to be discussed before we proceed is the meaning of a common proper time , when two orbits with different sscs are compared .",
    "each ssc defines its own center of reference , which implies that with each ssc the proper time that is measured along the above orbits is different , even if the orbits start with similar initial conditions .",

    "the same issues arise when geodesic chaos is studied in curved spacetimes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this is in few words the approach we adapt in our study for the time issue .",
    "for the issue of the distance in the configuration space between the two orbits , we have chosen to employ the euclidean metric .",
