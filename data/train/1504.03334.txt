    "brown dwarfs with effective temperatures @xmath5 below @xmath61000  k ( t and y spectral types ) are of great interest to understand the physics of cool atmospheres and pave the way for future studies of cool exoplanets with the james space webb telescope ( jwst ) and the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) .",
    "detailed spectra can now be obtained in the near - infrared ( nir ) for these objects using e.g. the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , or the gemini near - infrared spectrograph .",
    "the reddening of m / l dwarfs ( @xmath5 @xmath7 2000  k ) is thought to be the result of the condensation of silicate dusts and the subsequent cloud formation @xcite . at the l / t transition ( @xmath5 @xmath7 1300  k )",
    ", this reddening disappears with a sharp transition as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "given the high amplitude variability observed at the l / t transition ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this effect is interpreted as the clouds breaking up and forming holes at the photosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "yet , the spectral modeling of t and y dwarfs remains a challenge because the ir colors predicted by the cloudless models below @xmath61000  k appear too `` blue '' compared to observations .",
    "this additional reddening has recently been interpreted by @xcite as the emergence of sulfide and chloride clouds ( mns , na@xmath1s , and kcl ) . however , even with this cloudy approach , it appears difficult to obtain a good model of y - dwarf spectra ( see for example wisepc j1217b in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we show under which conditions the modeling of t / y - dwarf spectra is possible with a cloudless model . in sect .",
    "[ sect : code ] , we describe our 1d numerical code ` atmo ` and we apply it to t and y dwarf atmospheres in sect .  [",
    "sect : ty ] .",
    "the spectral modeling of y dwarfs is in good agreement with observations when vertical mixing is taken into account . for t dwarfs ,",
    "good agreement is obtained when the temperature gradient in the atmosphere is reduced .",
    "we discuss these results in sect .",
    "[ sect : disc ] and we suggest that the enhanced cooling in the deep layers of t dwarfs arises from the onset of fingering convection , resulting from the condensation of some species in very thin dust .",
    "we have developed a 1d radiative / convective code ` atmo ` solving for the pressure / temperature ( @xmath0 ) structure of an atmosphere , assuming a vertical energy balance between the internal heat flux and the radiative and convective fluxes , and vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the convection is taken into account using mixing length theory ( mlt ) as decribed in @xcite and @xcite with a mixing length of 1.5 times the local pressure scale height .",
    "the @xmath0 structure is solved on a cartesian plane - parallel grid for a given effective temperature @xmath5 and surface gravity @xmath8 .",
    "the chemistry takes into account @xmath6150 species at equilibrium with the condensation of @xmath630 liquids / solids assuming elemental abundances from @xcite , and is solved by minimization of gibbs free energy .",
    "the references of the thermodynamic data for the gas - phase species can be found in @xcite except for h@xmath1 whose thermodynamic data were fitted from the saumon - chabrier equation of state ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the data for the condensed species can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in the present models , we neglect rain - out processes and clouds .",
    "this approximation is critical to assess the abundances of some refractory elements such as na , k , and s because of the different condensation paths that can happen depending on the thermal history of the atmosphere ( e.g. naalsi@xmath3o@xmath9/kalsi@xmath3o@xmath9 will not form if al and si are removed at higher temperatures and na and k will condense in na@xmath1s and kcl ) .",
    "however in the spectral window of interest , the main absorbers such as h@xmath1o , nh@xmath3 , ch@xmath2 , co are not affected by this hypothesis and their abundances can even be computed analytically ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the code is coupled to the kinetic chemical network of @xcite , which includes @xmath61000 reversible reactions associated with @xmath6100 species based on c , h , n , o elements .",
    "vertical mixing is taken into account with a free parameter @xmath10 representing the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we perform a full chemical network run on the atmosphere by integrating the chemistry in time ( usually up to 10@xmath11 seconds ) and we reconverged the pt structure of the atmosphere on the fly until both the chemistry and the pt structure are in a steady state .",
    "the @xmath0 structure can be solved consistently with the out - of - equilibrium chemistry and can have a significant difference if a main absorber is quenched below the photosphere by the vertical mixing .",
    "we tested the kinetic chemical network by reproducing the results of @xcite for hd209458b and hd189733b .",
    "our results are also in good agreement with @xcite , especially considering the differences in elemental abundances and opacity line lists . for our case at @xmath5=1000  k ,",
    "log  g=4.5 and log  @xmath12=8.0 , we predict a quenched abundance of co at @xmath62@xmath13 and of nh@xmath3 at @xmath67@xmath14 , and the model with @xmath5=900  k , log  g=4.5 and log  @xmath12=8.0 in @xcite indicates a co abundance of @xmath15 ( fast2 chemical timescale * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a nh@xmath3 abundance of @xmath16 .    the line - by - line radiative transfer has already been described and tested in @xcite .",
    "the differences in radiative flux and heating rate between our line by line code and the radiative scheme used in the global circulation model of the uk met - office , the unifed model @xcite are generally of the order of a few percent .",
    "we use the same opacities for h@xmath1-h@xmath1 , h@xmath1-he , nh@xmath3 , h@xmath1o , co , tio and vo ( see table 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "methane ( ch@xmath2 ) has been updated with the new line list from the exomol project @xcite and we included the co@xmath1 opacity using the line list from @xcite with the line broadening available in the literature ( broadening coefficients from @xcite ) .",
    "we have also calculated opacities due to the extremely pressure - broadened sodium and potassium doublets using the line profiles of @xcite .",
    "we have used the correlated-@xmath17 method described in @xcite to speed up the convergence and combined the @xmath17-coefficients by using the random overlap method for the mixture @xcite .",
    "then we compute the surface spectrum from the converged pt structure using the line by line radiative transfer .",
    "the radiative transfer module also includes rayleigh scattering by h@xmath1 and he , using the accelerated @xmath18-iteration technique described in @xcite .",
    "abundance profiles of the main species in the modeling of wisepa j1541 .",
    "the dashed profiles correspond to the model at chemical equilibrium and the solid ones to the model with vertical mixing with @xmath10=10@xmath19 @xmath20s@xmath21 . ]",
    "@xcite have already demonstrated that ammonia is well below its chemical equilibrium abundance in t dwarfs based on the observed strength of th 9 - 11 @xmath22 m absorption feature .",
    "it has also later been confirmed in the nir lines of nh@xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite confirmed the signature of vertical mixing in all but one of their y dwarfs by the very absence of more detectable nh@xmath3 absorption .",
    "it has been expected that absorption by ammonia in the @xmath23 band should be present , but so far the data have not identified such a signature ( e.g. fig . 9 in * ? ? ?",
    "it has been also recently proposed by @xcite that ammonia is depleted in the atmospheres of y dwarfs . using the y dwarf wisepc j1217b ( y0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a template , we show in the left panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : spec ] that indeed a low abundance of ammonia is required to reproduce the shape of the @xmath23 band flux around 1  @xmath22 m and the correct flux in the @xmath24 band . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nh3_quenching ] , when vertical mixing is taken into account with a diffusion coefficient , the abundance profile of ammonia is quenched at a relatively deep level ( 50 - 100 bars ) , resulting in a depletion of ammonia by approximatively a factor 3 , significantly reducing the absorption in the peaks in the @xmath23 band .",
    "we took a value of @xmath25  @xmath20s@xmath21 for the eddy diffusion coefficient , which is within the high values explored by @xcite ; however the quenching of the nh@xmath3/n@xmath1 chemistry is relatively insensitive to the choice of @xmath10 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "when we include the vertical mixing , the condensation of h@xmath1o and nh@xmath3 is ignored for simplicity , this approximation is not an issue because the difference with and without condensation at equilibrium is small at these effective temperatures ( @xmath5 is shifted by @xmath610  k ) .",
    "importantly for the color - magnitude diagrams in the ir , the flux in the @xmath24 band at 1.6  @xmath22 m is increased and matches well the observed spectrum . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] , this increase in the flux is sufficient to produce the reddening required in @xmath4 to match the observations . applying the same physical treatment to the cooler brown dwarf wisepa j1541 ( y0.5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtain the same significant improvement between observed and synthetic spectra , as shown in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] . since we have included the complete chemical network of @xcite in ` atmo ` , we also predict the quenching of co and co@xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nh3_quenching ] ) , which will impact the flux at 4.5 @xmath22 m .",
    "t dwarfs have bluer colors in @xmath4 and @xmath26 than l dwarfs which indicates that the silicate and iron clouds should fall below the photosphere at the l / t transition .",
    "however , their spectra still present a reddening compared to cloudless models and @xcite proposed that another type of clouds such as sulfide clouds might be responsible for this residual reddening .",
    "we have calculated spectra for the t dwarfs ross 458c @xcite and ugps",
    "0722 - 05 @xcite whose spectra are shown in right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , we used a supersolar metallicity ( [ m / h]=0.3 ) for ross 458c based on the measured metallicity of its two companions ross 458 a and b. our cloudless models overestimate the flux in the @xmath23 and @xmath27 bands , yielding significantly bluer colors in @xmath4/@xmath26 compared to observations . since the photosphere in the @xmath23 and @xmath27 bands is deeper than the the photosphere in the @xmath24 and @xmath28 bands , reducing the temperature gradient in the atmosphere should decrease the @xmath29 flux compared to the @xmath30 flux .",
    "we have tested this idea by artificially modifying the adiabatic index @xmath31 of the atmosphere .",
    "the pressure / temperature profiles obtained with @xmath32=1.2 for ross 458c and @xmath32=1.27 for ugps 0722 - 05 , respectively , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_tdwarf ] , and the corresponding spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] . these models",
    "correctly reproduce the spectra and the colors in @xmath4/@xmath26 without the need to invoke additional cloud opacity . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_tdwarf ] , the amplitude of the temperature reduction required to match the observed spectra decreases with the effective temperature . therefore , for y dwarfs we found that there is no need to adjust the adiabatic index with respect to its expected value ( @xmath6  1.45 ) .",
    "the relative importance of the effects of vertical mixing and the reduction of the temperature gradient can be seen on the color - magnitude diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_col ] .",
    "pressure / temperature profiles of the models of ross 458c and ugps 0722 - 05 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to models with modified adiabatic index @xmath32 .",
    "the solid circles indicate the minimum pressures for which convection is present . without a modified adiabatic index ,",
    "the convection is overturning , while the modified index , illustrates heat transport by the fingering convection .",
    "the change in @xmath12 has little impact on the pt profile . ]",
    "as shown in sect .  [ sect : yd ] , a coherent cloudless model taking into account vertical mixing in the atmosphere is able to reproduce the near - infrared spectrum of y dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig : mag_col ] shows the color - magnitude diagrams for various cool t and y brown dwarfs in @xmath33 vs @xmath4 and @xmath34 vs @xmath35 . we have plotted a series of different models at constant @xmath36 as well as the cloudless and sulfide / h@xmath1o cloud models of @xcite .",
    "we display the models with and without vertical mixing and with and without modified adiabatic index to illustrate the relative impacts of these processes .",
    "although the cloudy models do yield redder colors in @xmath4 , providing a better match to the observed colors ( see fig .  16 in @xcite",
    ") , they predict also a large reddening in @xmath35 which is incompatible with the observations .",
    "the problem is even worse at larger gravity ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "in contrast , our cloudless models reproduce the correct @xmath4 and @xmath35 colors for y dwarfs , without any adjustable parameter . furthermore , as shown in sect .",
    "[ sect : yd ] , cloudless models consistently taking into account departure from chemical equilibrium due to vertical mixing in the atmosphere nicely reproduce the near - infrared spectrum of y dwarfs .",
    "our cloudless models are shifted in @xmath4 with respect to the ones of @xcite by nearly one magnitude at log  g=4.5 and we would get similar offsets if we compare our models at log  g=4.5 to their models at log  g=5.0 .",
    "part of the shift ( 0.3 mag ) can be explained by changing in our calculations , ( i ) the elemental abundances to @xcite , ( ii ) the line list for methane to the stds line list @xcite , ( ii ) the thermodynamical data of h@xmath1 to the one of the janaf database as used in @xcite . the origin of the rest of the shift remains unknown but is probably due to differences in the opacities of the other molecules .",
    "it seems more likely , however , that such low - temperature low - mass objects have gravities close to log  g=4.5 rather than log  g=5.0 @xcite .    for t dwarfs , both our cloudless models and the cloudy models",
    "reproduce the @xmath4 and @xmath35 colors . in the former case , as shown in sect .",
    "[ sect : yd ] , a good match of the spectrum requires a lower value of the atmospheric characteristic adiabatic index ( a good match is also obtained in @xmath33 versus @xmath26 ) .",
    "this adjustment can thus reflect either the effect of clouds or the signature of an energy transport mechanism that reduces the temperature gradient in the atmosphere .",
    "given the fact that , for t dwarfs , iron and silicate clouds are expected to have settled below the phostosphere , as mentioned previously , we favor the second suggestion .",
    "we suggest that the cooling is due to the onset of fingering ( thermohaline ) convection in t dwarf deep atmospheric layers , similar to the one triggered by salt gradients in earth oceans ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the limit of `` infinitely - thin '' dust condensation ,",
    "we have computed the mean - molecular - weight gradient in the atmosphere , @xmath38 , assuming that all the condensates remain in the atmosphere in their `` mono - molecular '' form ( e.g. , assuming that equilibrium chemistry predicts a given abundance of solid mgsio@xmath3 , we compute the mean molecular weight by keeping this abundance with the molecular weight of mgsio@xmath3 ) .",
    "this mean - molecular - weight gradient should be fairly representative of @xmath39 in the presence of small grains if the grain formation process does not significantly change throughout the atmosphere . as shown in @xcite",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath40 determines the extent of the overturning convection zone ( @xmath41 ) . in case the mean molecular weight increases with height in a stable atmosphere ( @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) , as in the present context , the possible existence of fingering convection is determined by the relation @xmath44 , where @xmath45 defines the inverse lewis number , i.e. the ratio of the molecular diffusivity @xmath46 to the radiative thermal diffusivity @xmath47 .",
    "this is the opposite situation to oscillatory double - diffusive convection , due to a _ positive _ molecular weight gradient and a destabilizing temperature gradient , suggested to occur in some giant planet interiors @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : finger_conv ] shows the atmospheric profiles of @xmath48 for ross 458c and wisepa j1541 , taking into account the molecular diffusivity of mgsio@xmath3(s ) and assuming that the thermal diffusivity is dominated by the radiative processes ( @xmath49 varies from @xmath50 @xmath20s@xmath21 at 1 kbar to @xmath51 @xmath20s@xmath21 at 1 bar ) . as seen , fingering convection ( i.e. @xmath52 ) is predicted to occur in some parts of these atmospheres .",
    "the magnitude of the mean - molecular - weight gradient is modest : @xmath53 for ross 458c .",
    "interestingly , while the extension of the fingering - convection zone is very large for ross 458c , it remains relatively small for the y dwarf wisepa j1541 .",
    "this is fully consistent with the fact that we need a lower adiabatic index for t dwarfs whereas this modification is not necessary for y dwarfs .    the transport mechanism needed to lower the temperature gradient has to be efficient to transport energies at the level of the internal flux of the object .",
    "the possibility that fingering convection could carry out such energy fluxes remains to be demonstrated . also the mixing induced by the convective fingers will reduce the destabilizing mean - molecular - weight gradient .",
    "a consistent theory of fingering convection in our model is needed in order to assess the possibility to have a self - sustained steady - state energy flux from the convection .",
    "nevertheless our results strongly suggest that fingering convection could occur in t dwarf atmospheres due to the destabilizing effect of dust condensation in the stably stratified part of the atmosphere , potentially impacting the energy transport in these objects compared to both warmer and cooler objects and leading to efficient cooling of their deep atmospheric layers .",
    "it can be expected that the increase of the convective energy transport will reduce the radiative flux in the corresponding region , hence reducing the temperature gradient in the atmosphere , as needed for the reddening in @xmath4 .",
    "color magnitude diagrams ( top : j - mag vs @xmath4 , bottom : y - mag vs @xmath35 ) for t / y brown dwarfs .",
    "the y - dwarf photometry is from @xcite and the l / t / m from @xcite .",
    "the modified adiabatic index is @xmath32=(1.15,1.2,1.25 ) for @xmath5=(1000k,800k,600k ) , no modification for @xmath54600k.,title=\"fig : \" ]   color magnitude diagrams ( top : j - mag vs @xmath4 , bottom : y - mag vs @xmath35 ) for t / y brown dwarfs .",

    "in the present paper , we have shown that    * cloudless atmosphere models can reproduce the observed infrared y dwarf spectral energy distribution , provided vertical mixing and out - of - equilibrium chemistry are properly taken into account to correctly predict the quenching of ammonia at deep levels , modifying its abundance profile . * cloudless models for t dwarfs with a reduced temperature gradient in the atmosphere",
    "correctly reproduce observed fluxes and colors .",
    "such a reduced gradient can be obtained by a modification of the adiabatic index in the atmosphere and could reflect either the effect of clouds or of another type of energy transport in the atmosphere .",
    "if clouds are effectively responsible for the reddening , the modification of the adiabatic index is an easy way to mimic the effect and could be used to better constrain cloud models that are currently used .",
    "* we suggest that fingering convection could be responsible for such a reduced temperature gradient .",
    "we demonstrate that the condensation of very thin dust under typical t dwarf atmosphere conditions could trigger this mechanism and that the extent of this process decreases with decreasing effective temperature , essentially vanishing for y dwarf atmosphere conditions .",
    "fundamental physical mechanisms such as atomic diffusion and hydrodynamical instability might thus take place in cold brown dwarf atmospheres and play a major role in their spectral evolution .",
    "future observations of cool objects with sphere , gpi , and jwst combined with comparisons with the different models should enable us to distinguish between these two effects : presence of clouds or reduced temperature gradient in t dwarf atmospheres .",
