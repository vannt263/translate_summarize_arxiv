    "during the last decade , the problem of engineered entanglement in atomic systems has attracted a great deal of interest ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the atomic entangled states were successfully realized through the use of cavity qed @xcite and technique of ion traps @xcite . at present ,",
    "one of the most important problems under consideration is how to make a long - lived and easy - monitored atomic entangled state with existing experimental technique .",
    "an interesting scheme has been proposed recently @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the two identical atoms are placed into a cavity tuned to resonance with one of the dipole - allowed transitions .",
    "initially both atoms are prepared in the ground state , while the cavity field consists of a single photon .",
    "it is easy to show that the atom - field interaction leads in this case to a maximum atomic entangled state such that the single excitation is shared between the two atoms with equal probability .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite to consider the absence of photon leakage from a nonideal cavity as a signal that the atomic entangled state has been created .",
    "the scheme can also be generalized on the case of any even number of atoms @xmath1 , sharing @xmath2 excitations . in this case , the atomic entangled states are represented by the so - called @xmath3 phase states @xcite .",
    "another interesting proposal is to use a strong coherent drive to provide the multipartite entanglement in a system of two - level atoms in a high - q cavity @xcite .",
    "this approach can be used to produce the atomic entanglement as well as that of atoms and cavity modes and even of different cavity modes .    in the schemes of refs .",
    "@xcite , the lifetime of the entanglement is defined by the specific time scale of the dipole - allowed radiative processes in atoms .",
    "unfortunately this lifetime is usually quite short @xcite .    generally speaking , the lifetime of atomic entanglement is specified by the interaction of atoms with environment . for example , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the environment is represented by the vacuum field that causes emission of a photon getting out of the cavity .    the interaction with environment",
    "can also be used to create a long - lived entanglement in atomic systems .",
    "for example , the initially non - entangled system may evolve to an entangled state connected with the atomic states that can not be depopulated by radiation decay . in this case , the lifetime of the entangled state is specified by the considerably long nonradiative processes .",
    "possible realization is provided by the use of three - level @xmath0-type process instead of the two - level scheme of refs .",
    "the process is illustrated by fig .",
    "the levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 are connected by the electric dipole transitions as well as the levels @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in turn , the dipole transition between the levels @xmath6 and @xmath4 is forbidden because of the parity conservation @xcite .",
    "the absorption of pumping photon by the transition @xmath7 with further jump of the electron to the level @xmath6 accompanied by emission of `` stokes '' photon can be interpreted as a kind of raman process in atomic system with emission of stokes photon ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is clear that the atom excited to the level @xmath6 can change the state either by absorption of the stokes photon resonant with respect to the transition @xmath8 or trough a nonradiative decay .",
    "assume now that the two identical @xmath0-type atoms are placed into a cavity of high quality with respect to the pumping photons resonant to the transition @xmath9 .",
    "we also assume that the stokes photons created by the transition @xmath10 either leave the cavity freely or are absorbed by the cavity walls .",
    "then , the atom - field interaction may lead to creation of maximum entangled atomic state @xmath11 whose lifetime is determined by the slow processes of nonradiative decay .",
    "the above scheme has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and briefly discussed in ref .",
    "the main objective of present paper is to consider in details the evolution towards the long - lived atomic entangled state ( 1 ) and feasibility of the scheme with present experimental technique .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the model hamiltonians that can be used to describe the process under consideration .",
    "viz , we discuss the model of a one - photon three - level interaction and an effective model of two - photon process in two - level system .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , we examine the irreversible dynamics in a cavity with leakage of stokes photons , leading to the state ( 1 ) . we show that both models describe the exponential evolution to the state ( 1 ) . at the same time , the effective model that corresponds to a rough time scale is unable to take into account the possible oscillations of population between the states @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "let us stress that the monitoring of stokes photons outside the cavity can be used to detect the atomic entangled state ( 1 ) in the case under consideration .    another way of creation of state ( 1 ) through the use of a cavity with very low quality with respect to the stokes photons",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "iv . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we discuss the possible realization of the scheme under consideration .",
    "assume that a system of @xmath12 identical three - level atoms with @xmath0-type transitions shown in fig .",
    "1 interacts with the cavity mode close to resonance with @xmath7 transition and with the stokes radiation that can leave the cavity freely .",
    "then , following @xcite , we can choose the model hamiltonian in the following form @xmath13 , \\label{2 } \\\\ h_{int}= \\sum_f",
    "\\lambda_p r_{21}(f)a_p+ \\sum_{f , k } \\lambda_{sk } r_{23}(f)a_{sk } + h.c . \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 denotes the photon operator of the cavity mode with frequency @xmath15 , @xmath16 describes annihilation of stokes photon with frequency @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the frequencies of the corresponding atomic levels with respect to the ground level @xmath4 .",
    "the operator @xmath20 gives the transition from level @xmath21 to level @xmath22 , index @xmath23 marks the number of atom . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the coupling constants , specifying the dipole transitions @xmath26 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "summation over @xmath27 in ( 3 ) implies that the stokes photons do not feel the presence of cavity walls .",
    "this summation involves the modes distributed with a certain density in a narrow band near the atomic transition frequency @xmath28 corresponding to the natural line breadth .",
    "apart from the total electron occupation number , the model ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) has the two integrals of motion @xmath29 consider the system of only two atoms .",
    "assume that both atoms are prepared initially in the ground states @xmath4 , the cavity contains a single photon of frequency @xmath15 , and stokes field is in the vacuum state .",
    "then , because of the integrals of motion ( 5 ) , the evolution of the system occurs in a single - excitation domain of the hilbert space spanned by the vectors @xmath30 by construction , the four states ( 6 ) labeled by the superscripts @xmath31 manifest the maximum entanglement .",
    "no one of the states ( 6 ) is the eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . at the same time",
    ", it is easily seen that the action of operator ( 3 ) can not transform the states @xmath32 into the states @xmath33 and vice versa .",
    "thus , the evolution of the system from the initial state @xmath34 occurs in the subspace spanned by the three vectors ( 7 ) . in this case",
    ", the states ( 8) can be discarded from the basis ( 6 ) .    instead of the one - photon three - level model described by the hamiltonian ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , an effective model of two - photon process can also be used under a certain condition @xcite .",
    "viz , if the cavity is tuned consistent with two - photon energy conservation , i.e. @xmath35 we are left with only one detuning parameter @xmath36 here @xmath37 denotes the energy of corresponding atomic level .",
    "then , it was shown in @xcite that under the condition @xmath38 the dynamics of the system is governed by the effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath39 , \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describing the two - level transition with simultaneous absorption of pumping photon and creation of stokes photon . here",
    "@xmath40 is an effective coupling constant .",
    "under the assumption that there are only two three - level @xmath0-type atoms in the cavity and that the system is initially prepared in the state @xmath34 in ( 5 ) , in view of the results of previous section we should choose the time - dependent wave function as follows @xmath41 using the reduced basis ( 7 ) . here for simplicity we use the notations @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) then leads to the following set of equations for the coefficients in ( 11 ) @xmath44 to find solutions of ( 12 ) , let us represent the last equation in ( 12 ) in the form @xmath45 then , we should take the time derivative in both sides of the first equation in ( 12 ) and substitute the second equation together with integral representation ( 13 ) .",
    "we get @xmath46 carrying out the integration by parts , we get the following integro - differential equation with respect to only one unknown variable @xmath47 : @xmath48 this integro - differential equation can be analyzed through the use of laplace transformation , which is usually considered in the context of natural line breadth ( see ref .",
    "let us emphasize that , in contrast to the conventional wigner - weisskopf theory , eq .",
    "( 14 ) contains the second - order derivative in addition to the first - order term . in other words",
    ", it should describe oscillations together with the decay .",
    "we have @xmath49 then , eq . ( 14 ) is reduced into the following algebraic equation with respect to @xmath50 : @xmath51 \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ = - ( \\omega_p+\\omega_{21})+ i \\sum_k \\lambda^2_{sk}\\frac{s+i(\\omega_{31}+\\omega_{sk})}{s^2 + ( \\omega_{31}+\\omega_{sk})^2 } - \\int_0^{\\infty } e^{-st } \\ { \\sum_k \\lambda_{sk}^2 \\nonumber \\\\ \\times ( \\omega_{31}+ \\omega_{sk } - \\omega_p )",
    "\\int_0^t c_1(\\tau)e^{i(\\omega_{31}+\\omega_{sk})(\\tau -t)}d \\tau \\ } dt .",
    "\\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term in the right - hand side of this expression can be represented as follows @xmath52t}dt \\nonumber \\\\",
    "= \\frac{\\cal l}{s+i ( \\omega_{31 } + \\omega_{sk } ) } .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , eq . ( 15 ) takes the form @xmath53 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\times   [ is^2-s ( \\omega_p+\\omega_{21})+i(\\omega_p\\omega_{21 } -2 \\lambda_p^2- \\sum_k \\lambda_{sk}^2 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "+ \\sum_k \\frac { \\lambda_{sk}^2 ( \\omega_{31}+\\omega_{sk}-\\omega_p)}{s+i(\\omega_{31}+\\omega_{sk } ) } ] ^{-1 } .",
    "\\label{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , the exact form of the time behavior of the coefficient @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) is governed by the inverse laplace transformation @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a small real positive number and @xmath56 in the integrand is considered as a complex argument .",
    "as soon as the explicit time behavior of @xmath47 is known , the other coefficients in ( 10 ) can be defined through the use of eqs . ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "in particular , it follows from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 10 ) , and ( 11 ) that the probability to have the atomic entangled state ( 1 ) has the form @xmath57 thus , the eqs .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 17 ) completely determine the probability to have the robust entangled state ( 1 ) .",
    "it can be shown that eq . ( 16 ) describes the reversible , poincare type behavior ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the irreversible evolution can be obtained under the further assumption that the atomic transition @xmath58 interacts with continuum of stokes modes rather than with a discrete spectrum .",
    "similar assumption is used within conventional wigner - weisskopf theory @xcite .",
    "this means that we replace summation over @xmath27 by integration over @xmath59 : @xmath60 here the measure @xmath61 defines the density of states of stokes photons with different frequencies corresponding to the natural line breadth . unlike conventional wigner - weisskopf theory , eqs .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 17 ) describe a superposition of exponential decay and harmonic oscillations caused by the interaction between the @xmath7 transitions and cavity field .",
    "further analysis shows that , the coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 up to the second order in @xmath64 are @xmath65e^{-i\\omega_pt}\\nonumber\\\\ c_2(t)&\\approx&-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}{i\\gamma+\\delta}\\left[e^{-\\gamma t}-e^{-(\\frac{2\\lambda^2}{\\gamma - i\\delta}+i\\delta)t}\\right]e^{-i\\omega_{21}t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the detuning factor for the pumping mode and @xmath67 since @xmath68 , @xmath69 and the result ( 19 ) corresponds to the second order order with respect to @xmath70 .",
    "it is seen that eq . ( 19 ) describes the damped oscillations of the coefficient @xmath47 in ( 10 ) . according to ( 11 ) ,",
    "coefficient @xmath71 manifests similar behavior .",
    "thus , the probability ( 18 ) to get the robust entangled state tends to unit as @xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "the decay time @xmath73 is defined by the coupling constant and detuning parameter for the pumping mode and by the width of the stokes line specified by the parameter @xmath74 . although eq .",
    "( 19 ) contains oscillating terms , the decay is quite strong and the influence of oscillating terms can not be observed even when @xmath75 .",
    "only when detuning strongly exceeds @xmath74 , the oscillations start to contribute significantly into the time evolution of probability ( 18 ) .",
    "similar result can also be obtained in terms of the effective hamiltonian ( 9 ) @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the assumptions made in the process of derivation of ( 9 ) lead to an effective `` roughing '' of the time scale .",
    "the obliteration of the level @xmath5 leads to the simultaneous neglect of the rabi oscillations between the levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the effective model ( 9 ) is incapable of recognition of time oscillations and gives only rough picture of purely exponential evolution .    while the atomic system evolves to the maximum entangled state",
    "( 1 ) , the stokes photon leaves the cavity .",
    "thus , the observation of stokes photon outside the cavity can be considered as a signal that the robust entangled state has been prepared .",
    "the atomic entangled state ( 1 ) can also be realized when the stokes mode is strongly damped in the cavity . for simplicity , we still assume no damping for the pumping mode . at the same time , the stokes photons are supposed to be absorbed by the cavity walls . in other words , we consider the case of high quality ( with respect to pumping field photons ) and zero - temperature cavity , corresponding to the most of the ridberg maser experiments @xcite . in this case",
    ", the effect of damping can be calculated through the use of the so - called dressed - atom approximation @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian , describing the process under consideration , can be chosen as follows @xmath76 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\sum_f [ \\lambda_p r_{21}(f)a_p+ \\lambda_s r_{23}(f)a_s]+h.c . \\label{20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this corresponds to the single - stokes - mode approximation in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( 20 ) have the form @xmath77 where @xmath34 coincides with the first state in ( 6 ) , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 in eqs .",
    "( 21 ) , @xmath80 under the assumption of exact resonance @xmath81 that we use hereafter for simplicity , the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath82 besides that , there is one more eigenstate @xmath83 such that @xmath84 it is clear that this eigenstate corresponds to the maximum atomic entanglement ( 1 ) .",
    "physically , this state is achieved when the stokes photon is absorbed by the cavity walls .    to take into account the cavity damping of stokes photons , consider interaction with a `` phonon reservoir '' responsible for the absorption of photons by cavity walls @xcite .",
    "then , the hamiltonian ( 20 ) should be supplemented with the term @xmath85 where @xmath86 are the bose operators of `` phonons '' in the cavity walls .",
    "the density matrix of the system can be chosen as follows @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the eigenstates ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) and @xmath89 denote the time - dependent @xmath90-number coefficients .    with the total hamiltonian @xmath91 in hand , we can now write the master equation , eliminating the cavity degrees of freedom ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , @xmath92 + \\kappa \\ { 2a_s \\rho a^+_s -a^+_sa_s \\rho - \\rho a^+_sa_s \\ } , \\label{25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the contribution of ( 23 ) is taken into account effectively through the liouville term . here",
    "@xmath93 is the lifetime of a stokes photon in the cavity and @xmath94 is the quality factor with respect to the stokes photons ( @xmath95 denotes the energy of the level @xmath6 ) .",
    "let us choose the same initial condition as in previous section , so that @xmath96 where the initial state @xmath34 is expressed in terms of the eigenstates ( 21 ) as follows @xmath97 the equation ( 25 ) can now be solved numerically at different values of parameter @xmath98 , specifying the absorption of stokes photons .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the system evolves to the robust atomic entangled state ( 1 ) .",
    "the stairs - like structure is again caused by competition between the transitions @xmath7 and @xmath58 .",
    "although such a behavior is an inherent property of the model under consideration , the stairs become more visible with increase of @xmath98 ( see fig .",
    "similar result can also be obtained within the framework of effective model with the hamiltonian ( 9 ) and damping described by eq .",
    "( 23 ) . in this case",
    ", the density matrix consists of only six elements because the state @xmath99 in ( 21 ) should be discarded and the states @xmath100 are changed by the states @xmath101 with the eigenvalues @xmath102 it should be stressed that the effective model does not show the stairs - like behavior of @xmath103 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the quantum dynamics of a system of two three - level atoms in the @xmath0 configuration interacting with two modes of quantized electromagnetic field in a cavity under the assumption that the stokes - mode photons either leave the cavity freely or are damped rapidly .",
    "it is shown that in both cases the system evolves from the state when both atoms are in the ground state and cavity contains a pumping photon into the robust entangled state ( 1 ) .",
    "the lifetime of this final state is defined completely by the nonradiative processes and is therefore relatively long .    in the case of cavity transparent for the stokes",
    "photons , the creation of stokes photon signalizes the rise of atomic entanglement .",
    "such a photon can be monitored outside the cavity .",
    "let us stress that the general models with the hamiltonians ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 20 , that takes into account all three atomic levels , admit a certain peculiarities in the evolution towards the robust entangled state caused by the competition of transitions @xmath9 and @xmath58 .",
    "the effective model with adiabatically eliminated highest excited level is incapable of description of these peculiarities , while predicts correct asymptotic behavior .",
    "moreover , the general model admits also a number of intermediate maximum entangled states ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) that do not exist in the effective model .",
    "unfortunately , the lifetime of these entangled states are defined by the dipole radiative processes and are therefore too short .",
    "it seems to be possible to realize the robust entangled state ( 1 ) using the present experimental technique .",
    "let us note in this connection that the single - atom raman process has been recently observed @xcite .",
    "we also note that the way of experimental preparation of single - photon cavity excitation is well known @xcite .",
    "the atoms can propagate through the cavity , using either the same opening or two different openings .",
    "all measurements aimed at the detection of atomic entanglement can be performed outside the cavity .    although our results were obtained for a system of two atoms , they can be generalized with easy on the case of big atomic clusters , using the method of ref .",
    "in fact , it is possible to show that a certain robust entanglement can be obtained in a system with any even number @xmath106 of three - level @xmath0-type atoms initially prepared in the ground state and interacting with @xmath12 pumping photons .",
