    "the size of a hard sphere is an intrinsic property , but for continuous potentials the exclusion volume is a statistical concept and the distance of closest approach between particles in a binary collision is momentum dependent .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to expect that the correlation hole will affect transport properties in a similar fashion as the finite particle size of hard - spheres .",
    "in fact , in his 1922 paper  @xcite , enskog himself gave indications as to how his theory might be applied to real systems .",
    "in the next section , we discuss challenges that arise when attempting a systematic derivation of a generalized enskog equation for soft potentials , then we outline a phenomenological approach that enables progress on approximating fluid transport coefficients .",

    ", width=302 ]    following the coarse - graining method that kirkwood used to derive the boltzmann equation in his 1946 paper  @xcite , the distribution functions of the bbgky hierarchy are time - smoothed over an interval from 0 to @xmath73 , where the time @xmath73 is long compared to the time of a collision and short compared to the time between collisions . for instance , for the single - particle distribution function ,    phase - space . the latter satisfies the first bbgky equation , + * v*=_0^ + [ equation_f1 ] where @xmath74 is the interaction vertex and @xmath29 is the two - particle distribution function .",

    "this was found to be accurate especially for simple gases at packing fractions corresponding to @xmath86 ( for example , see  @xcite )    our goal is analogous to that of the modified enskog theories in that we seek appropriate analogies to relate key features of the realistic system to the hard sphere model",
