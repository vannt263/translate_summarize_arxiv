    "the cataclysmic variable v426 oph has proven to be somewhat enigmatic , even though it is a bright ( v=11.513.4 ) system that has been studied for a number of years since its discovery as a nova - like with an emission line spectrum @xcite .",
    "a detailed spectroscopic study by hessman ( 1988 ) revealed a k3 dwarf secondary in a 6.85  hr orbit with a white dwarf , with an inclination of @xmath2 and at a distance of 200 pc .",
    "he concluded this was a z cam type of dwarf nova with outbursts approximately every 22 days and some standstills in the light curve occurring about one magnitude fainter than the outburst brightness .",
    "this interpretation would indicate v426 oph is a system with such a high rate of mass transfer that it is very close to the upper limit for dwarf novae outbursts @xcite .",
    "however , there are several observational clues that v426 oph might also harbor a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "iue observations show an unusually flat flux distribution in the uv , possibly indicating the truncation of a hot inner disk by a magnetic white dwarf ( i.e. an intermediate polar ) , while the x - ray flux at quiescence is larger than for typical dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "the emission lines show flaring activity and a phase shift from a location near the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "most importantly , quasi - periodic variability has been seen in the optical and x - ray at a period near 30 min at a brightness comparable to standstill @xcite and near 1 , 2.5 or 4.5  hrs in the x - ray at quiescent brightness ( szkody 1986 , rosen et al .",
    "1994 ; but see hellier et al .",
    "while none of these periods could be positively identified as that of the rotation of the white dwarf to confirm the identification as an intermediate polar , the different brightness states combined with the lack of a long stretch of continuous observation have hampered attempts to resolve the origins of the observed periodicities .    with the advent of _ chandra _",
    ", high resolution x - ray spectroscopy can be combined with uninterrupted long light curves to obtain much better information on the accreting regions of cataclysmic variables .",
    "results are now available for the dwarf novae u gem @xcite , and wx hyi @xcite , the intermediate polar ex hya @xcite , along with 5 other cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "one of the surprising results is how similar the spectrum of the low mass accretion disk system u gem is to that of the intermediate polar ex hya . @xcite",
    "have found that the seven systems can be divided into two groups .",
    "the first group , which includes u gem and ex hya , shows a bremsstrahlung continuum with strong h and he - like ion emission as well as ions from fexvii - fexxiv .",
    "the other group shows a harder x - ray continuum and little fe l - shell emission .",
    "they suggest the differences in these two groups may be due to differences in the accretion rate per unit area . in the first group ,",
    "the energy is released as optically thin radiation in a steady state cooling flow . in the second",
    ", the line emission arises from a plasma photoionized by the hard continuum . to further explore these ideas , and to try to resolve the nature of the accretion in v426 oph",
    ", we obtained a _",
    "observation at quiescence , together with simultaneous optical photometry and a single optical spectrum .",
    "we also obtained additional optical photometry ( in quiescence ) at a later date .",

    "differential photometry with respect to comparison star 1 in @xcite was accomplished with the braeside observatory ( bo ) 0.4 m reflector using a site 512 ccd camera and a bessell v filter on 2002 may 31 ut .",

    "july 25 and 28 ut longer duration differential photometry in harris r ( 4.0  hrs ) and i ( 6.3  hrs ) was obtained at manastash ridge observatory ( mro ) , with its 0.75 m reflector .",

    "a single low resolution optical spectrum ( 6 ) was also obtained during the _ chandra _  observation , using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) on the 3.5 m apache point observatory ( apo ) telescope , providing spectral coverage from 3800 - 5200  and 6000 - 8000  ( figure  [ fig : apospec ] ) .",
    "this spectrum also confirms that v426 oph was at a quiescent state , exhibiting characteristic broad balmer emission lines .",
    "all the observations are summarized in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "we reprocessed our data starting from the level 1.5 event file , as advised by the _",
    "chandra _",
    "x - ray center . to check for intervals of high background",
    "we constructed an off - source lightcurve , but as none were found we were able to use the standard good time intervals as supplied .",
    "we chose to remove after - glow detection , as for these data it may have led to exclusion of good events .",
    "we applied destreaking to the s4 chip , to produce a clean level 2 event file , at the same time restricting our energy range to 0.310.0 kev , where calibrations are most reliable .",
    "we used tgextract to derive the type ii pulse height analyzer ( pha ) file . to achieve maximum signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , we opted to add + 1 and -1 grating orders , for both the medium ( meg ) and high ( heg ) energy grating spectra , creating type i pha files .",
    "the script add_grating_orders also generated the appropriate grating response files for these co - added spectra .",
    "for high - resolution spectra it is generally advised to include the systematic sensitivity degradation of the acis chips ( due to a build - up of absorbing material ) as an independent model component .",
    "however we found that our s / n was insufficient to constrain the individual elemental abundances of the material .",
    "instead , we corrected the ancillary response files ( arf ) for the expected absorption at the time of observation , based on the nominal elemental composition .",
    "the heg and meg spectra are shown in figure 2 .      first , in order to compare to earlier work we fitted a limited , mostly line free section of our spectrum from 2.0 to 5.0 kev with a simple thermal bremsstrahlung plus absorption model .",
    "our best fit yielded a poorly constrained column of @xmath4 , and @xmath5kev , with a reduced @xmath6 for 827 degrees of freedom . both from this and simple inspection of the spectra we can see that v426  oph  belongs to the first group of cvs identified by @xcite ; namely those best fit by a cooling flow as opposed to a photo - ionization model , with a maximum temperature nearer 20 than 80 kev .",
    "we therefore proceeded to attempt a global cooling flow fit to our high - resolution spectra , using xspec with the same model as @xcite .",
    "a suitable background file was obtained with the ciao tg_bkg script .",
    "we used the ftool to associate the appropriate redistribution matrix ( rmf ) , arf and background files with the co - added first order grating pha files .",
    "we also used grppha to group the spectra both simply binning by 4 , then with binning to give @xmath7 counts per bin .",
    "the s / n of our spectra is such that we opted to use the @xmath7 counts per bin , and used @xmath8 statistics for fitting .    in order to attain the best constraints possible",
    "we performed joint fits to both the heg and meg spectra , over wavelength ranges of 1.715  and 2.220    respectively , where counts are most adequate for fitting .",
    "initially , we constrained the column to the @xmath9 , 1.6 and @xmath10@xmath11 found by _",
    ", _ ginga _ and _ rosat _ observations respectively @xcite .",
    "the intermediate column from the _ exosat _ spectrum gave the best fit , with @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , with the column left free we achieved a best fit for @xmath13@xmath11 , giving a @xmath14 for 1718 d.o.f .",

    "we chose a shock speed of 4250  @xmath37 , to give a desired temperature of 22 kev , and complete electron - ion thermal equilibration . in this case , we compared the model results to specific line fluxes and ratios .",
    "idl routines were used to extract background subtracted and binned data in wavelength and flux units for both heg and meg . to estimate line fluxes for the stronger lines we used the iraf splot task to sum the flux over the width of the line above a continuum estimated by hand . for the weaker lines , important for line diagnostics ( see next section ) , we instead used gaussian fits to short segments of the meg spectrum using binning with s / n@xmath382 per bin , constraining the line widths to be the same .",

    "these experiments showed that the line ratios are essentially independent of whether the flow is isobaric or isochoric , as expected , except that photoionization is relatively more important in the constant density case .",
    "radiation from the cooling gas does affect the ionization state at the lower temperatures , but even for constant density cooling the effects are only 10 - 20% reductions in ratios such as o  viii / fe  xxv .",

    "the seven spectral bands were co - added to give us maximal s / n .",
    "we examined whether this data could also be fit by the periods we found in the high s / n uninterrupted _ chandra _  lightcurve .",

    "both single sinusoid fits are shown overlaid on the data in figure  [ fig : roslc ] .",
    "the _ ginga _ data have a long time - base ( 72  hrs ) but , like _ rosat _ , interrupted sampling due to earth occultations .",
    "we obtained 64s binned lightcurves from the heasarc , for the 26  kev range ( where the spectrum peaks and s / n is best ) , then applied a quadratic detrend to remove longer term variations .",
    "the periodograms revealed evidence of significant flickering but peaks close to the 4.2  hr and its harmonic were by far the most significant .",
    "once again a constrained double sinusoid fit yielded periods of @xmath57  hrs and @xmath58  hrs , consistent with the _ chandra _  data . however , the fit has @xmath59 for the 863 d.o.f , probably as a result of the extensive flickering , but also the morphology of the profile . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gingalc ] we show folded and phase binned data , where the binning should average out the effects of flickering .",
    "although the modulation is modulated primarily at the harmonic ( 2.1  hrs ) , the differing morphology of the two humps in the lower fold accounts for the significance of the 4.2  hr signal .",
    "@xcite reexamined the _ exosat _ data in which @xcite detected a @xmath060 min periodicity and suggested an intermediate polar classification for v426  oph .",
    "they concluded that the modulation was not in fact statistically significant .",
    "moreover , they noted that the modulation on the white dwarf s spin should be greatest at low energies , since it is due to absorption effects .",
    "hence , the hardness ratio ( hard / soft flux ) should be anti - correlated with the total flux .",
    "we have investigated the energy dependence of our significant 4.23  hr modulation .",
    "we extracted 800  s binned lightcurves in two energy bands , 0.32.5  kev for the soft and 2.56.0  kev for the hard , which approximately splits the counts evenly . in both bands",
    "the modulation is apparent , and indeed the signals are significant at @xmath1599.95% confidence level .",
    "although the percentage amplitudes are different , with a hard band peak  peak amplitude of @xmath60% versus @xmath61% in the soft , the hardness ratio values are consistent with a constant , the signal at 4.23  hrs being merely 5% confidence .",
    "we also applied a spearman rank correlation test comparing the hardness ratio with the full - band lightcurve .",
    "this yielded the expected anti - correlation though only at the 2@xmath62 level .",
    "we succeeded in obtaining optical photometry which overlaps the _",
    "chandra _",
    "x - ray by 3.5 hours at the end of the observation .",
    "this lightcurve is plotted for ease of comparison in figure  [ fig : simlc ] ( top panel ) .",
    "although the simultaneous coverage is limited , it is clear that the optical variability is in general _",
    "anti_-correlated with the x - ray , and that it also exhibits an @xmath04.2  hr periodicity . a spearman rank correlation test yields an anti - correlation at the 3.7@xmath62 level .",
    "further quiescent lightcurves were obtained in 2003 july ; the lightcurves , lomb - scargle periodograms and folded and phase binned data are presented in figures  [ fig : mro_rlc ] and  [ fig : mro_ilc ] .",
    "once again fitting sinusoids , we find a modulation in the @xmath63 data at a period consistent with the first harmonic of the 4.2  hr in the x - ray , @xmath64  hrs .",
    "the power spectrum also shows a number of significant peaks in the 2050 min range , indicative of flickering . in the @xmath65 band ,",
    "the best fit period is @xmath66  hrs , similar to half that of the orbit , as expected for an ellipsoidal modulation .",
    "indeed , adding a second sinusoid at double the period does improve the fit .",
    "however , in neither case are the periods formally consistent with those derived by @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the lightcurve does not quite span a full orbit , and together with the irregular / quasi - periodic flickering , this may well account for the discrepancy .",
    "lastly , removing the 3.1  hr sinusoid from the @xmath65 data we find that a significant modulation ( @xmath67% confidence ) remains at @xmath68 min , which is in agreement with the x - ray ( from _ ginga _ ) and optical periods presented by @xcite . subdividing the lightcurve into four parts ,",
    "we find that the amplitudes are comparable at both the minima and maxima of the 3.10  hr cycle , although the frequency does shift , indicating that this too is most likely only quasi - periodic flickering .",
    "the classic signature of an ip is the presence of two or more coherent periodic modulations corresponding to the binary orbit , white dwarf spin and possibly their beat . in table",

    "however , in at least one other case , ex hya during outburst @xcite , it appears that any signal on the white dwarf spin , emitted from the magnetic disruption / corotation radius , is washed out by the line emission from the outer disk .    while a white dwarf spin is the easiest explanation for the 4.2  hr period , the physical origin of this long @xmath80 is problematic .",
    "first , if we assume that v426  oph  possesses a fairly typical field for an ip ( 110 mg ) and mass transfer rate of @xmath93yr@xmath94 , then the alfvn radius is @xmath0@xmath95 cm for spherical accretion , or half that in the disk case .",
    "depending on the actual values used this radius could easily be smaller than both the radius of closest approach of the stream from the secondary and that of the initial ring that would form , hence formation of a disk is certainly possible @xcite .",
    "however , if we also assume that the corotation radius is similar , one requires a @xmath96 min , while @xmath97  hrs would place the corotation radius outside the roche lobe ( @xmath98 cm as compared to the white dwarf-@xmath99 point separation @xmath100 cm ) . even taking @xmath101  hrs , which is in itself difficult to reconcile with the data , leads to a corotation radius comparable to the size of a typical disk ; hence the entire disk would be non - keplerian and in a transitional state to full magnetic dominance .",
    "in addition , for disk - less accretion the size of the magnetic moment and in turn surface field are unreasonable , even taking @xmath101  hrs , we estimate @xmath102 mg .    an alternate model was put forward by @xcite to account for the spin - orbit equilibrium at @xmath103 of the short period ip ex hya . in this instance , the magnetic moment is such that the corotation radius is in fact comparable with the distance to the @xmath99 point . @xcite",
    "have more recently extended this work in an attempt to explain the entire range of spin - orbit equilibria seen for ips . from their figure 2 , we see that at @xmath104hrs , and @xmath105 , we are within the uncertainties of the model ( which does assume @xmath106 in any case ) in obtaining a suitable equilibrium .",
    "but a longer period ( larger ) system like v426  oph  requires @xmath107g@xmath108 , or equivalently @xmath109 mg , comparable to the most magnetic polars .    an alternative non - magnetic origin for the 4.23  hr modulation could be stream overflow , which brightens a particular region of the disk . from @xcite tables",
    "iii and iv , the keplerian period at the outer radius of the disk @xmath110 is @xmath111=0.07 , which is much too small .",
    "conversely , to obtain a ratio of 0.62 , would require @xmath112 , again highly implausible .",
    "a final possibility is that we could be seeing v426  oph  in an non - equilibrium state , where m was greatly reduced on myr timescales compared to what we now observe .",
    "however , this is an ad hoc assumption which has no satisfactory explanation .",
    "it is instructive to compare our spectral results on v426  oph , with those of previous x - ray observations and _ chandra _  results on other cvs . given its z cam classification , the mass transfer rate for v426  oph  should be high . instead the value @xmath0@xmath113 places it in the middle of the five cvs that @xcite fit with cooling flows .",
    "moreover , we may compare this to an estimate of the mass accretion rate from the x - ray luminosity , @xmath114 , which yields m=@xmath115 , assuming half of the energy is released as x - rays .",
    "but as @xcite comment in the case of wx hyi ( where the cooling flow yields m a factor of five less than obtained from fits to the uv continuum ) , these x - ray fits give m in the outer disc , which may well not be accreting during quiescence , as the disk builds up for the next outburst .    as previously noted , for a thermal bremsstrahlung fit ( @xmath116@xmath11 , @xmath117  kev ) , the _ exosat _ data yielded a high 210  kev flux of @xmath118 , suggesting a magnetic system .",
    "for a thermal spectrum plus fe line at 6.8  kev , the _ ginga _ data gave a flux value a factor of two lower , together with an even higher column ( @xmath119@xmath11 ) , and a lower temperature ( @xmath120  kev ) .",
    "however , at the time of the _ ginga _  observation v426  oph   was in a stand - still state , close to outburst , hence the lower flux and higher column can be expected .",
    "our _ chandra _  observation provides another look at the quiescent state , but we have found a column and temperature intermediate between _",
    "exosat _ and _ ginga _ , @xmath121@xmath11 and @xmath020  kev respectively .",
    "moreover , the flux given by the best cooling flow fit , @xmath0@xmath122 ( 210  kev ) , is much lower than either of the past satellite observations .",
    "thus , it appears difficult to directly compare data taken at different outburst states and with different instrument sensitivities .",
    "if v426  oph  contains a magnetic white dwarf , the x - rays should arise from a cooling region behind the accretion shock , and a shock model for the emission lines is appropriate .",
    "@xcite found that polar spectra were better fit by models of photoionized plasma .",
    "both polars and intermediate polars must have emission both from the cooling zone behind the accretion shock and from the photoionized gas upstream .",
    "the difference may be that polars have much narrower accretion columns and higher densities , and the recombination radiation from the photoionized accretion stream scales as the density squared .",
    "the emission per unit accreted mass from the shock , on the other hand , is independent of density",
    ". ratios of lines from 3s and 3d levels of iron ions are a good diagnostic for photoionized plasmas @xcite , and the ratios of the fe xvii lines and ratios of fe xxiv lines confirm that the emission from v426 oph originates in a collisionally ionized plasma .",
    "the match between observed fluxes and the shock model is far from perfect , but it is close enough to indicate that the shock structure is basically correct . in particular , thermal conduction would tend to produce overly strong o viii and fe xvii lines unless it is suppressed by magnetic fields or turbulence .",
    "it is probably not advisable to make too much of the differences between the shock model and the observations at present , because accretion shocks are thermally unstable @xcite .",
    "the instability and secondary shocks can modify the emission line spectrum at the factor of 2 level @xcite .",
    "our analysis of a long uninterrupted _ chandra _",
    "x - ray lightcurve of v426  oph  together with optical photometry and reanalysis of archival x - ray data , has revealed a persistent period at 4.2  hrs , unrelated to the known orbit .",
    "in contrast , we find that previous candidate spin periods seen in past x - ray studies at @xmath00.5 and 1  hrs are most likely non - persistent qpos",
    ". our simultaneous x - ray / optical photometry shows that the modulations are anti - correlated and therefore the variations must arise from different parts of the system ; possibly due to the reprocessing of beamed x - radiation .",
    "indeed , the period of 4.2  hrs is easiest to interpret as the rotation of the white dwarf , implying that v426  oph  is , after all , an ip , and making it the first long period ip with a similar spin - orbit equilibrium to ex hya , @xmath123 . however , this interpretation leads to problems with the magnetic field strengths and mass accretion rates that are typical for intermediate polars .    the high - resolution spectrum places v426  oph  as a member of the group of cvs , including u gem and ex hya , where the x - rays are emitted from a cooling flow . indeed",
    ", more detailed modeling of the line fluxes for such a shock model lends further support to the magnetic cv interpretation .",
    "we are grateful to the referee , rick hessman , for his helpful review .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through _ chandra _ award go2 - 3033x .",
