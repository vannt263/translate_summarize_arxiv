    "deep imaging of high redshift @xmath20 galaxies at mid - infrared wavelengths with the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) on _ spitzer _ has led to the surprising discovery that @xmath21 galaxies have red @xmath22\\sim0.5 $ ] colors .",
    "this has been taken as evidence of substantial stellar masses @xmath23 @xcite and stellar ages ( @xmath24myr ) @xcite . early studies also suggested that the specific star formation rate at fixed stellar mass was nearly flat at @xmath25 , in apparent disagreement with the strongly increasing specific inflow rates of baryons predicted by galaxy formation models ( e.g. , neistein & dekel 2008 ; dav et al .",

    "a key uncertainty in the analysis of the photometry is how much rest - frame optical emission lines contribute to the broadband fluxes",
    ". if emission lines are very strong , then the stellar masses previously derived by fitting stellar population models without lines would be biased high , and the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) would be biased low ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . to address this issue ,",
    "emission lines have been included in some stellar population models ( e.g. , schaerer et al .",

    "( 2012 ) studied the evolution of the @xmath26 equivalent width at @xmath27 using near - ir spectra and predict very large values at @xmath1",
    ". if the emission lines are indeed as strong as argued , then deep photometry should be able to reveal the effect of the lines moving through the irac passbands with redshift .",
    "this technique has been applied successfully by looking for excess flux in the @xmath2-$]band due to @xmath26 at @xmath28 ( e.g. shim et al .",
    "2011 , stark et al . 2013 ) and by comparing the average observed irac colors over @xmath29 ( gonzalez et al .",
    "2012 ) . nevertheless , the current situation is that the contribution of emission lines at @xmath30 is still poorly known .",
    "direct estimates at @xmath1 would provide the best constraints yet on the evolution of emission line strengths and specific star formation rate to the highest redshifts .",
    "fortunately , at redshift @xmath1 a relatively clean test is possible for the strength of the strongest lines [ ] @xmath31+@xmath32 , because these lie isolated in the @xmath3 $ ] filter .",
    "then main challenge is the extreme faintness of the sources .    in this letter",
    ", we use the largest sample of @xmath1 galaxy candidates in combination with newly acquired ultradeep irac data from the irac ultra deep field program ( iudf ; pi labb ) to study their colors , seds , the contribution of emission lines , and to derive emission line corrected stellar masses and specific star formation rates . throughout this paper ,",

    "this survey increases the exposure time over the hudf , hudf09 - 1 and hudf09 - 2 fields from @xmath35 hours to @xmath36120 hours , @xmath3650 hours , and @xmath37 hours , respectively . for the wider goods area we use the 23@xmath3846 hour deep irac coverage of goods ( m. dickinson et al . in preparation ) .",

    "however , the criteria from bouwens et al . 2011 and",
    "oesch et al 2012 were chosen in such a way that the samples would have a very similar redshift distribution . ]",
    "we derive new irac photometry of all 76 sources following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "briefly , we subtract nearby foreground sources based on their hst image profiles and determine local backgrounds ( see e.g , gonzalez et al 2011 ) .",
    "then we perform aperture photometry through @xmath40 diameter apertures on the cleaned images and correct the flux for light outside the aperture using a profile derived from nearby stars ( @xmath41 in [ 3.6 ] and @xmath42 in [ 4.5 ] ) .",
    "details of the photometry are presented in labb et al .",

    "the trend is seen both in irac detected galaxies and in @xmath58 selected samples ( @xmath59 ) , including irac undetected galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the observed @xmath2-[4.5]$ ] colors ( rest - frame @xmath60 ) are generally redder than the bc03 models , with larger offsets at bluer @xmath57  colors .",
    "figure  3 shows the average spectral energy distributions of irac detected galaxies at @xmath1 compared those at @xmath9 , only 130myr later .",
    "it is obvious that the observed @xmath2-[4.5]$ ] colors are markedly different .",
    "shifted to the rest - frame , the seds viewed together suggest a clear flux excess at @xmath61 , shifting from @xmath2 $ ] at @xmath9 to @xmath3 $ ] at @xmath1 .",
    "the excess is likely caused by [ ] @xmath62 and @xmath32 emission lines , which are expected to be strong in young star forming galaxies at low metallicities ( e.g. , schaerer et al .",
    "2010 ) .    nevertheless , it is difficult to determine the emission line contribution using stellar population model fits to the broadband photometry at each redshift separately .",
    "degeneracies between age and dust in the model colors and systematic uncertainties in implementation of emission lines hamper such a direct solution . instead , we will attempt to circumvent this limitation by using the joint sed information at the two adjacent redshifts to isolate the effective emission line contribution .",
    "figure  4 shows clearly that the observed @xmath2-[4.5]$ ] colors at @xmath1 are 0.8 mag redder compared to @xmath9 , while the @xmath22 $ ] colors are 0.4 mag bluer for @xmath1 and @xmath63 for @xmath9 , hence both @xmath64 in luminosity at @xmath1 and @xmath9 respectively . ] .",
    "changes in stellar population age and/or dust can not produce such differences , but strong optical emission lines naturally reproduce the observed change .    with the reasonable assumption that the average rest - frame spectrum is the same at both @xmath1 and @xmath9 , we can solve directly for the rest - frame equivalent width of these emission lines .",
    "considering only @xmath65{\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007}$ ] and @xmath32 and applying the redshift selection functions of @xcite and @xcite , a linear fit to the colors produces w@xmath11{\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007}+h\\beta}=500$] .",
    "the redshift distribution accounts for the fact that emission lines may contribute to both @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] . using the tabulated emission lines values of anders & fritze-v.alvensleben ( 2003 ) for sub - solar metallicity @xmath66 @xcite , we also correct for the smaller integrated contributions of h@xmath67 , h@xmath68 , h@xmath69 , [ ] and [ ] , leading to w@xmath11{\\lambda\\lambda4959,5007}+h\\beta}=670$] .    note that this estimate is to first order independent of stellar population models and",
    "the fit only has one free parameter : the combined rest - frame equivalent width of the strong emission lines .",
    "the main systematic uncertainty is the redshift selection function for the @xmath9 sample , as the [ ] line moves from the @xmath2 $ ] to the @xmath3 $ ] filter at @xmath70 a secondary uncertainty is the effect of metallicity , which changes the emission line ratios . to evaluate the impact of both effects we shift the central redshift of the @xmath9 distribution by up to @xmath71 in either direction and vary the metallicity from @xmath72 .",
    "we add these systematic uncertainties in quadrature to the photometric errors arriving at w@xmath11\\lambda\\lambda{4959,5007}+h\\beta}=670^{+260}_{-170}$] selected subsample , targeting galaxies around @xmath73 @xcite , yields a similar value w@xmath11\\lambda\\lambda{4959,5007}+h\\beta}=560$]@xmath74 . ] .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width implies a boost of @xmath75 mag to @xmath3 $ ] and smaller @xmath76 mag to @xmath2 $ ] at @xmath1 , meaning the color of the stellar continuum is @xmath2-[4.5]\\approx0 $ ] . using the line ratios of anders & fritze-v.alvensleben ( 2003 ) for a metallicity of @xmath77 and taking into account the slope of the continuum ( @xmath78 constant or @xmath79 ) the corresponding @xmath26 equivalent is w@xmath13 .",
    "note that the inferred w@xmath26 depends on assuming line ratios .",
    "a common approach to estimate the ssfr is derive it from @xmath80 , using the @xmath26 to sfr conversion of @xcite and the stellar continuum from bc03 stellar populations synthesis models .",
    "the model adopts a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) between @xmath81  @xmath82 , a metallicity of 0.2 @xmath83 , and constant star formation rate . using the indirect estimate of @xmath26 we derive @xmath84  gyr@xmath15 , corresponding to an approximate stellar age of @xmath16myr .",
    "the estimated ssfr is not very sensitive to the assumed star formation history ( e.g. , declining and rising sfh introduce changes @xmath85 dex ) , but potentially significant uncertainties are the intrinsic line ratios , the possibly larger attenuation of the emission lines compared to the continuum and the escape fraction of ionizing photons .",
    "larger attenuation and a non - zero escape fraction would increase the derived ssfr .",
    "fitting bc03 models with csf to the broadband seds , we inspect the stellar masses and mass - to - light ratios after correcting the irac @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] bands for emission line contributions",
    ". the derived mass - to - light ratios of irac detected galaxies at @xmath1 are @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in good agreement with those found by @xcite for two bright @xmath1 sources .",
    "the @xmath88 would have been overestimated by @xmath17 if emission lines had not been corrected .",
    "the scatter in @xmath88 , based on the intrinsic scatter in @xmath22 $ ] and assuming csf , is @xmath89 dex and @xmath90 dex , where the luminosities refer to the stellar continuum only .",
    "this is likely a lower bound to the true scatter in @xmath88 due to selection effects .",
    "the typical @xmath91 galaxy ( corresponding to @xmath52 ) has a median rest - frame color @xmath92 ( stellar continuum only ) and a stellar mass @xmath93 .",
    "model fits to the corrected seds can also be used to determine ssfrs , although these are rather uncertain due to the degeneracies between age and dust and the weak constraints on the uv@xmath38slope @xmath68 at @xmath1 @xcite . to mitigate the difficulties somewhat",
    ", we can fix the reddening to @xmath94 , consistent with the average @xmath68 values of bright @xmath9 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the best - fit ssfr is then @xmath95  gyr@xmath15 , in good agreement with the ssfr derived from @xmath80 .",
    "we derive integrated stellar mass densities of @xmath96band selected galaxies to faint uv - limits by converting the stepwise @xmath97luminosity function @xcite to stepwise mass densities , using the best - fit @xmath88 to the emission line corrected sed .",
    "note that the emission line correction is derived from @xmath98 galaxies , so we assume that the effect of emission lines is similar for @xmath99 galaxies .",
    "this approximation is unavoidable as sub@xmath100 galaxies are currently beyond the reach of spitzer , even at our ultradeep limits .",
    "we derive uncertainties by randomly drawing @xmath101 lfs , perturbing the stepwise lf and @xmath88 ratios by their errors , and integrating the resulting mass densities .",
    "integrating to @xmath102 yields @xmath103mpc@xmath19 .",
    "this paper presents new ultradeep irac data from the iudf program ( 120 hours in @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] over the hudf ) in combination with a large sample of 63 @xmath104dropout galaxies at @xmath1 to study average hst / wfc3 and spitzer / irac seds , the effect of emission lines , and their impact on stellar population model fits .",
    "the most exciting result is the direct detection of large numbers of @xmath1 galaxies by spitzer / irac to faint limits , without signs of a hard `` confusion limit '' .",

    ", we compare to recent estimates for star forming galaxies from other surveys ( shown in figure  5 ) . while direct comparisons are difficult due to different techniques and stellar mass ranges , our results confirm the picture of an increasing importance of emission lines towards higher redshift ( e.g. , shim et al .",

    "( 2012 ) over @xmath108 , but in agreement with their model which assumes that the cumulative number density of progenitors at higher redshift remains constant ( e.g. , dokkum et al .",
    "2010 , papovich et al .",
    "2011 ) .    clearly , at such high equivalent widths emission lines can not be ignored when deriving stellar masses and ages at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "obviously , a huge leap in the determination of the properties of galaxies at these redshifts will be made possible by the arrival of jwst .",
    "but in the mean time wider and still deeper future irac observations will continue to provide valuable insight into the properties of the @xmath1 population , with emerging detections of @xmath117 ( e.g. , zheng et al . 2012 ) galaxies probably not far behind .",
