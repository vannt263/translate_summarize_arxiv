    "radial photometric gradients in the old populations of elliptical galaxies have been recognized for almost 40 years as fundamental clues to galaxy evolution . at optical wavelengths",
    "the amplitudes of gradients are modest .",
    "they are challenging to measure and are known to suffer from a serious age - abundance degeneracy ( e.g.  oconnell 1986 ; worthey 1994 ) , wherein it is difficult to distinguish small changes in age from small changes in metallicity .",
    "however , ellipticals also contain a stellar component with an effective temperature higher than 20000 k which appears to be unusually sensitive to the age and chemical abundances of their old populations .",
    "the hot component is well isolated in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv , @xmath0  ) from the cooler main sequence and red giant branch components which dominate galaxy light at longer wavelengths .",
    "fuv observations therefore offer an important means of assessing population characteristics independent of those widely used to date , once the physics of the hot component is well understood . in this paper",
    "we discuss spatial gradients in the hot component and their correlation with gradients in the optical - band mg@xmath1 metal line index .",
    "the hot `` uv upturn '' or `` uvx '' component was first detected in fuv photometry of nearby spiral bulges and e / s0 galaxies by the oao and ans experiments ( code & welch 1979 , de boer 1982 ) .",
    "it was subsequently identified with the old populations of these systems after alternative candidates , most prominently young massive main sequence stars , were excluded through uv spectroscopy ( e.g.  oke , bertola , & capaccioli 1981 ; welch 1982 ; oconnell , thuan & puschell 1986 ; burstein et al .",

    "; oconnell et al .",

    "; bertola et al .  1995 ; cole et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the uvx varies considerably among and within galaxies .",
    "v colors exhibit a much larger range ( 2 - 3 mags ) between galaxies than do the more familiar optical - ir colors for old populations .",
    "there is superficially a good correlation with metal abundance : the nuclear uv colors of e galaxies , measured with the @xmath2 aperture of iue , correlate well with the index mg@xmath1 , which measures the mg  i @xmath3 mgh absorption features near 5170   ( burstein et al.1988 ) . the fuv ",
    "v colors become bluer ( i.e.  the uvx becomes stronger ) as mg@xmath1 increases . however , the available sample is not large enough to distinguish a smooth relation between the uvx and mg@xmath1 from the effects of several distinct groups of systems ( dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 ) .",
    "we found strong radial gradients in uv colors within galaxies from photometry with the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) obtained during the 1990 _ astro-1 _ mission ( oconnell et al .",
    "the measurements , at 1500  and 2500 , covered the inner 1 - 2  of m31 ( sb ) , m81 ( sb ) , ngc@xmath41399 ( ge ) , and m32 ( de ) .",
    "in the first three cases , the uvx became stronger at smaller radii as line strengths increased .",
    "m32 exhibited a large reversed gradient , with the uvx becoming stronger at larger radii ( up to @xmath5 ) , even though its optical color gradients are small ( davidge 1991 , peletier 1993 , hardy et al .  1994 ) .",
    "the existence of large and easily measured uv color gradients encouraged us to observe a larger sample of e / s0 galaxies during the 1995 _ astro-2 _ mission . here",
    "we report on the brighter objects in the _ astro-2 _ sample and examine correlations between the radial gradients in the uvx and mg line strengths .",
    "the galaxy sample included here spans a large range of absolute magnitude and metallic line strengths . in order of decreasing central uvx strength ( @xcite ) , the galaxies with their revised shapley ames catalog morphological classifications ( sandage & tammann 1987 ) are m87 [ e0 ] , ngc@xmath41399 [ e1 ] , m60 [ s01(2 ) ] , m89 [ s01(0 ) ] , m49 [ e1/s01(1 ) ] , ngc@xmath43115 [ s01(7 ) ] , ngc@xmath43379 [ e0 ] and m32 [ e2 ] .",
    "all uv data are from the march 1995 _ astro-2 _ mission with the exception of ngc@xmath41399 , for which we have re - reduced the _ astro-1 _ data using the final flux calibration for that mission .",
    "the uit is a @xmath6 ritchey - chrtien telescope with a 38 cm diameter clear aperture .",
    "it offers a large field of view ( @xmath7 diameter ) and good spatial resolution ( @xmath8 ) , allowing detailed two - dimensional uv photometry of galaxies . only images with the fuv filters b1 and b5 and the longest exposure times ( 5501560  s ) are analyzed here .",
    "these have effective wavelengths of 1520 and 1615   and full widths at half maximum of 350 and 225  , respectively .",
    "the detector is a two - stage image intensifier coupled with fiber optics to kodak  iia - o film .",
    "the csi photocathode provides excellent rejection of longer - wavelength photons , and no `` red leaks '' are detectable in observations of cool systems like e / s0 galaxies .",
    "details of the basic data reduction are given in stecher et al .",
    "we employ the final flux calibrations from _",
    "astro-1 _ and _ astro-2 _ here , denoted `` flight15 '' and `` flight22 , '' respectively , the latter based on photometry of 49 stars observed in common with iue .",
    "we confirmed that the stellar calibration is valid for extended sources by comparing _",
    "astro-2 _ data of the bright reflection",
    "nebula ngc@xmath47023 ( witt et al .  1992 ) with newsips ( nichols & linsky 1996 ) iue spectra of this object .",
    "the overall flux zero - point of uit photometry is accurate to about 10% . in this paper",
    "we use the monochromatic magnitude system for the fuv , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the incident flux in units of @xmath11 .",
    "galaxy fuv photometry was performed as in oconnell et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , using circular annuli .",
    "sky background levels were generally determined from photometry in large annuli centered on each galaxy .",
    "typical sky brightnesses are @xmath12 mag @xmath13 . because the uit mid - uv camera failed early in the _",
    "astro-2 _ mission , we can not measure the ( 15002500  ) colors we used in oconnell et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . instead",
    ", we have compared our fuv surface photometry to b - band photometry from @xcite for m89 ; @xcite for m49 , m60 , m87 , and ngc@xmath43379 ; @xcite for m32 ; cheng et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for ngc@xmath41399 ; and our own ccd observations for ngc@xmath43115 .",
    "optical surface brightness measurements made along elliptical isophotes with semi - major axis @xmath14 and semi - minor axis @xmath15 were projected to the intermediate radius @xmath16 for comparison with fuv measurements made with circular annuli .",
    "most galaxies in our sample have axial ratios near 1.0 , and numerical experiments showed that the fuv ",
    "b color profiles are not biased by this process . since we are interested only in the shapes of the profiles , the data in the figures have not been corrected for foreground galactic extinction .    in agreement with earlier studies ( bohlin et al .",

    "1998 ) , we find the fuv emission from most of these objects to be distributed smoothly on the sky , not in clumps or knots , as would be expected if the uv light was produced by young , massive stars ( the fuv images will appear in marcum et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in general , the fuv contours of our sample are consistent in shape and orientation with b - band isophotes .",
    "there is no uv morphological evidence for significant massive star formation in these galaxies .",
    "m87 and ngc@xmath43379 are the only objects showing fuv emission that is not smooth on the sky . in the case of m87",
    ", we see the uv counterparts of the bright active nucleus and non - thermal jet .",
    "the fuv structure in the jet is consistent with that observed at other wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the nucleus and jet were excluded from the analysis presented in figures  1 - 3 , even though they contribute only about 17% of the fuv light within 20 .",
    "there is also some optical - band evidence that m87 contains a young - star `` accretion population '' associated with its x - ray cooling flow ( mcnamara & oconnell 1989 ) , which may produce its unusually flat 2000 - 2800 spectrum ( burstein et al .",
    "this could account for the modest differences in its fuv profile compared to the rest of our sample ( see below ) ; however , its gross fuv properties are similar to the other objects .",
    "ngc@xmath43379 shows fuv evidence of a dust lane or other dark linear structure @xmath17 in length to the se of the nucleus at @xmath18 .",
    "its effects are visible in the profiles plotted in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "this feature is distinct from the small ( @xmath191.4 ) ring discussed by van dokkum & franx ( 1995 ) and has not been reported at other wavelengths .",
    "the b - band profiles of all eight objects are well fitted by @xmath20 de  vaucouleurs functions , which are characteristic of spheroids . in the fuv , m89 ,",
    "ngc@xmath43115 , and m32 also display roughly de  vaucouleurs profiles ( see figure  1 ) , as does ngc@xmath41399 in both the fuv and mid - uv ( @xcite ) . by contrast , the inner fuv profiles for m60 , m49 , and ngc@xmath43379 are more consistent with an exponential function , though the profiles tend to flatten at large radii .",
    "m87 s fuv profile is consistent with neither function . because of the significant fuv ",
    "b color gradients , it is not necessarily expected that the uv profiles of objects which are true spheroids at optical wavelengths would be strictly de  vaucouleurs in shape . what is perhaps more surprising is that some appear to be exponential .",
    "although exponentials are normally associated with disks , the fuv isophotal contours are consistent with the b - band contours in shape and orientation , and the 3-dimensional fuv light distributions are therefore unlikely to be genuinely disklike .",
    "b color profiles are plotted in figure  2 .",
    "the objects display a large ( 3 mag ) range in central colors .",
    "this is very different from the behavior of early - type galaxies at optical wavelengths ( e.g.  peletier et al .",
    "the color ranking of the objects is consistent with that based on iue spectroscopy ( @xcite ) .",
    "five of the galaxies ( m87 , ngc@xmath41399 , m60 , m49 , and m32 ) display large internal fuv ",
    "b color gradients , with net changes larger than 1.0 mag over the region photometered . again",
    ", this is unlike the very mild color gradients encountered in the optical and ir .",
    "m89 , ngc@xmath43115 , and ngc@xmath43379 have smaller overall color changes .",
    "m32 is the only object which becomes bluer in fuv ",
    "b at larger radii , confirming our _ astro-1 _ photometry ( oconnell et al .",
    "the sense of the fuv color gradients inferred by brown et al .",
    "( 1997 ) within six of these objects by comparison between iue spectra ( @xmath21 aperture ) and _ astro-2_/hut spectra ( @xmath22 ) is also consistent with our higher resolution photometry .",
    "internal extinction by dust can not be responsible for these gradients .",
    "they are so large that significant optical - band effects would be expected , since @xmath23 ) , where @xmath24 is the total extinction in magnitudes .",
    "_ astro_/hut spectroscopy also places strict , and low , limits on the amount of internal extinction ( ferguson & davidsen 1993 , brown et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "interestingly , all the objects except m32 exhibit an inner `` plateau '' in color before a steeper reddening sets in , usually at radius @xmath25 .",
    "there is almost a 2-component structure in some cases .",
    "the outermost measures have lower precision , but the breaks in the mean gradients are well determined .",
    "such structure is not common in optical data , though overall amplitudes are lower there , which could prevent its detection in some cases .",
    "the mean logarithmic gradient ( @xmath26 ) in fuv ",
    "b for each object was determined by a fit to the fuv  b color profile for the region interior to the optical half - light radius ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "data points were weighted by the inverse of their estimated photometric uncertainties , so the gradients are representative of the inner parts of the profiles .",
    "this method is consistent with that used by gonzlez & gorgas ( 1996 ) for the mean @xmath27 gradient .    in figure  3",
    "we plot the internal fuv ",
    "b color gradient against the internal mg@xmath1 gradient .",
    "mg@xmath1 gradients for m32 , m49 , m60 , m89 , ngc@xmath43115 , and ngc@xmath43379 were kindly provided by j.j .",
    "gonzlez ( @xcite ) ; h. kuntschner kindly provided mg@xmath1 data for ngc@xmath41399 ; the gradient for m87 is from davies , sadler & peletier ( 1993 ) .",
    "there is no correlation evident between the two gradients .",
    "although the sample is small , it spans the range of observed internal gradients in both uv and metallicity properties .",
    "the best evidence now is that the uvx originates predominantly from he - burning , extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) and post - hb evolutionary phases .",
    "these objects have very small envelope masses ( @xmath28 ) on the hb , and they are probably descendents of the dominant metal - rich stellar population , rather than a metal - poor minority component . no more than @xmath29% of the metal rich red giants need",
    "pass through the small - envelope channel to produce the strongest uv upturns .",
    "net uv output is governed mainly by mass loss processes on the red giant branch and by the helium abundance .",
    "metal abundance and age have a less direct effect , though these do combine to influence mass loss .",
    "this interpretation is based on theory and iue spectroscopy ( e.g.  greggio & renzini 1990 ; horch , demarque , & pinsonneault 1992 ; bressan , chiosi , & fagotto 1994 ; dorman et al.1995 ; and yi , demarque , & oemler 1997 ) and also on 912 - 1600   spectra for e galaxies obtained by the _ astro_/hut experiment ( ferguson & davidsen 1993 ; brown et al .",
    "contributions by hot metal - poor stars , an alternative urged most recently by park & lee ( 1997 ) , are small , based on the shape of the spectra for 9122500  ( dorman et al.1995 ; brown et al .",
    "1997 ; yi , demarque & oemler 1998 ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the uv color variations is then that they are related to metallicity , probably in two ways .",
    "first , increased metallicity probably drives larger mass loss on the rgb , producing hb objects with smaller envelopes and hence larger uv output .",
    "second , it is possible that systems with higher metallicities also have larger he abundances ( with @xmath30 - 3 ; e.g.   greggio & renzini 1990 ) , which yield larger uv outputs for a given envelope mass .",
    "recent studies of fe and mg line indices ( e.g.  worthey et al .  1992 ; worthey 1998 ; trager et al .",
    "1998 ) demonstrate that although there are significant variations in [ mg / fe ] among different elliptical galaxies , nonetheless within a given galaxy [ mg / fe ] @xmath31 _ constant_. since the internal mg line strength gradients reflect metallicity gradients , we then expect objects with larger mg gradients to have larger uv color gradients .    despite this expectation and the strong apparent correlation between nuclear measures of the uvx and mg ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 ) , the direct comparison of fuv  b and mg gradients in figure  3 shows no correlation .",
    "the breaks in the color slopes shown in figure  2 , which are not characteristic of optical gradients , also suggest a distinct behavior for the uvx .",
    "to study the latter further , we are comparing local values of fuv  b and mg@xmath1 as a function of radius ( ohl et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "our results then imply that the uvx may not be simply related to overall metal abundances in galaxies and that other parameters are involved .",
    "age is perhaps the leading candidate .",
    "other things remaining constant , hb envelope mass should decrease , and the uvx should increase , with increasing age .",
    "m32 , with a large and reversed uvx gradient , is an important case .",
    "it has optical gradients which are smaller but in the same sense as the other objects .",
    "it is notable for the presence of an intermediate age ( @xmath32 gyr ) stellar population and possibly an age gradient in which the central regions are younger ( oconnell 1986 , freedman 1992 , rose 1994 , hardy et al .  1994 ,",
    "faber et al .",
    "1995 , grillmair et al .",
    "its unusual uv behavior supports the notion that age is important to the uvx .",
    "one alternative interpretation is that helium abundance is decoupled from metallicity ( i.e.  @xmath33 _ constant _ ) in elliptical galaxies .",
    "there are few other observables in old populations which are sensitive to he abundance , so the latter is an intriguing possibility .",
    "we are grateful to all the participants in the uit and _ astro-2 _ projects .",
    "we thank j. j. gonzlez and h. kuntschner for providing metallicity gradient data in advance of publication and k. p. cheng and p. m. marcum for providing ground - based optical images . this work was supported in part by nasa grants nag5 - 700 and nag5 - 6403 to the university of virginia .",
