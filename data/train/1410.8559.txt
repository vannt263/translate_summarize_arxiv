    "we will focus here on exclusive hadronic decays of the tau lepton .",
    "an updated detailed account on this topic , containing inclusive analyses , leptonic tau decays , and cpv and lfv searches in tau decays as well , can be found in ref .",
    "+ the matrix element for @xmath0 decays , where @xmath1 stands for the final - state hadrons , can be written @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is the hadronic matrix element of the left - handed qcd current evaluated between the initial hadronic vacuum and the final - state mesons . in eq .",
    "( [ h_mu ] ) , @xmath4 are the set of allowed lorentz structures and @xmath5 the hadronic form factors , scalar functions depending on the kinematical invariants ( @xmath6 ) , which reduce to the charged - meson decay constants ( @xmath7 ) for one - meson tau decays .",
    "this , in turn , are well - known from the measured @xmath8 decay rates @xcite .",
    "multi - meson modes start to provide non - trivial information on the hadronization of qcd currents . +",
    "a model / theory is needed to compute the @xmath5 in this case , and observables are readily obtained either directly in terms of them , or using their appropriate combinations , the structure functions @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath9 gev implies that the dynamics of hadronic tau decays will be mostly influenced by the lowest - lying light - flavored resonances like @xmath10 or @xmath11 , so that their propagation must be accounted for in the hadronic form factors .",
    "+ among the many approaches that have been developed with this purpose , let us mention the gounaris - sakurai ( gs ) @xcite and khn - santamara ( ks ) @xcite parametrizations and the resonance chiral lagrangians ( @xmath12 ) approaches @xcite that we will be discussing .",
    "+ these input form factors are fitted to data , directly or by means of a monte carlo generator ( which also helps to better estimate the backgrounds for a given process ) , being tauola @xcite the standard one in these low - energy applications .",
    "related developments @xcite are of interest both for theorists and experimentalists , for flavor - factories and colliders .",
    "+ this kind of analyses should render the determination of resonance parameters : masses , widths and couplings .",
    "contrary to the most common practice , model parameters should be avoided for the first two . instead",
    ", physically meaningful model independent parameters shall be used , as they are those defined by the pole position of the resonance in the complex plane @xmath13 which should be the ones quoted by the pdg @xcite .",
    "+ aleph , cleo , delphi and opal first @xcite , and then the two - flavor factories -babar and belle- @xcite have been providing data on exclusive hadronic decay modes of the tau lepton with increasing precision and the prospects for belle - ii @xcite and future planned facilities @xcite are very much promising .",
    "this demands a corresponding effort on the theoretical description of these decays .",
    "recent theoretical developments on hadronic tau decays are discussed in the next section using the well - known two - pion vector form factor ( vff ) to explain them .",
    "the ks - like parametrizations of the hadronic form factors are built fixing their normalizations to the leading order chiral perturbation theory result @xcite , as linear weighted combinations of breit - wigner factors accounting for the dominant exchanged resonances .",
    "for instance , in the case of the @xmath14 vector form factor @xmath15 where @xmath16 , the ks - parametrization reads @xmath17 with @xmath18 where the off - shell resonance width , @xmath19 , is obtained from the absorptive part of loop functions involving pions and kaons .",
    "the gs expressions add to eq.([bw_ks ] ) a contribution resembling the one produced by the real part of these loops , shifting both numerator and denominator .",
    "+ however , both ks and gs parametrizations do violate the low - energy expansion of qcd @xcite at next - to - leading order @xcite , introducing a systematic error in the analyses using them .",
    "this bias can ( and should ) be avoided by approaches built on the basis of chiral symmetry , as they are the @xmath12 . in fact , these intend to interpolate between the two known extreme regimes of qcd : the chiral limit at low energies and the operator product expansion ( ope ) of qcd at high energies ( @xmath20 ) . an extensive program @xcite has been developed to work out the restrictions imposed on the resonance couplings by the ope .",
    "the existence of a consistent minimal set of short - distance constraints applying to the two- and three - point green functions and related form factors in the resonance region has been shown in both intrinsic parity sectors @xcite .",
    "these were obtained in the @xmath21 limit @xcite within the single resonance approximation including multi - linear operators in resonance fields and working the latter in the antisymmetric tensor formalism .",
    "such procedure provides a sound theoretical basis for the @xmath12 and their application to study two- and three - meson tau decays . +",
    "a complementary approach uses dispersion relations to obtain the hadronic form factors . in this way , analyticity and unitarity",
    "are automatically fulfilled and the poorest known ( high - e ) region is suppressed by the subtractions of the dispersive integrals .",
    "consequently , results are also less sensitive to the precise short - distance qcd constraints , minimizing the effect of the error associated to the @xmath22 expansion . + again",
    ", in the case of the charged two - pion vff one would have @xcite @xmath23 \\ , \\ ] ] for the three - subtractions and @xmath24 -which are taken as free parameters- and @xmath25 , which is fixed by cvc . ]",
    "case , where the phaseshift , @xmath26 is obtained as @xmath27}{\\re e \\left[f_v^{\\pi^-\\pi^0(0)}(s)\\right ] } \\ , \\ ] ] using an input form factor @xmath28 , which can be provided by the @xmath12 @xcite @xmath29-s } \\\\ & & = \\frac{m_\\rho^2}{m_\\rho^2 \\left[1+\\frac{s}{96\\pi^2 f_\\pi^2}\\re e \\left(a_\\pi(s ) + \\frac12 a_k(s)\\right)\\right]-s - i m_\\rho \\gamma_\\rho(s)}\\ .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ su2formula ] ) the whole complex chiral loop functions @xmath30 @xcite have been resummed in the denominator ensuring analyticity .",
    "unitarity is also warranted in the elastic region . beyond it ,",
    "inelastic coupled channel effects need to be included .",
    "these are essential in obtaining the scalar @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 form factors @xcite . for final states with more than two mesons , only ref .",
    "@xcite has taken into account these effects in the @xmath33 form factors .",
    "+ constructs analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ fv_3_subtractions]-[su2formula ] ) have been employed also in the @xmath31 vff @xcite and first attempts at describing the @xmath34 vff have also been undertaken @xcite .",
    "in particular , a joint analysis of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 decays has recently allowed @xcite an improved determination of the @xmath37 pole mass and width parameters according to eq.([pole ] ) , this pole determination might not be feasible . ]",
    "@xmath38 the analysis of belle data @xcite for the number of events distribution measured in @xmath39 decays yields the pole position @xcite @xmath40 in nice agreement with alternative determinations .",
    "+ two - pion vff belle data @xcite are compared to different theoretical approaches in fig .",
    "[ fig ] .     ]",
    "three - meson tau decays provide a much richer dynamical structure with up to four participating form factors .",
    "a reasonably good understanding has only been achieved for the three - pion modes @xcite but ongoing efforts extend also to the @xmath41 @xcite , @xmath42 @xcite and @xmath33 @xcite decay channels .",
    "a description of the state - of - the - art parametrizations for the @xmath43 and @xmath41 hadronic form factors in tauola is given in olga s",
    "talk @xcite .",
    "+ for multi - meson modes the biggest challenge is to go beyond the @xmath12 description of @xmath44 of ref .",
    "@xcite , including operators multi - linear in resonance fields , specially taking into account the soon expected release of belle data on these decay spectra @xcite . for even higher - multiplicity modes , there are only parametrizations based on the ks model @xcite and isospin relations @xcite , which provide a first estimate on these decays .",
    "more exotic modes have also been studied recently @xcite .",
    "+ for the most abundant decay modes radiative corrections become an issue . consequently , they have been studied for the one - meson @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath31 modes @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) where they are important for testing lepton universality , extracting @xmath45 and obtaining @xmath46 , respectively , using tau decay data .",
    "these corrections are still lacking for the @xmath43 decay modes where they will be certainly needed with the advent of belle - ii data .",
    "hadronic decays of the @xmath47 lepton are a clean probe of the hadronization of qcd currents in the light - flavor sector at low energies .",
    "while inclusive studies are ideal for extracting fundamental parameters like @xmath48 or @xmath45 , exclusive analyses are able to determine resonances properties with precision .",
    "+ @xmath12 and dispersion relations are the best theoretical approaches to deal with hadronization in these decays .",
    "two - meson and three - pion decay modes are well understood , so the challenge is now on controlling the corresponding radiative corrections .",
    "+ all other multi - meson modes are still not described satisfactorily .",
    "dedicated effort is needed from the collaboration between experiment and theory through monte carlo generators , specially with forthcoming flavor facilities in mind .",
