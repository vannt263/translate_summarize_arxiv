    "epidemic , one of the most important issues related to our real lives , such as computer virus on internet and venereal disease on sexual contact networks , attracts a lot of attention . among all the models on the process of the epidemic , susceptible - infected ( si ) model @xcite , susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) model @xcite , and susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model @xcite ,",
    "are considered as the theoretical templates since they can , at least , capture some key features of real epidemics . after some classical conclusions have been achieved on regular and random networks , recent studies on small - world ( sw ) networks @xcite and scale - free ( sf ) networks @xcite introduce fresh air into this long standing area ( see the reviews @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the most striking result is that in the sis and sir model , the critical threshold vanishes in the limit of infinite - size sf networks .",
    "it is also a possible explanation why some diseases are able to survive for a long time with very low spreading rate .    in this paper , we focus on the sis model .",
    "although it has achieved a big success , the standard sis style might contain some unexpected assumption while being introduced to the sf networks directly , that is , each node s potential infection - activity ( infectivity ) , measured by its possibly maximal contribution to the propagation process within one time step , is strictly equal to its degree . as a result , in the sf networks the nodes with large degree , named _ hubs",
    "_ , will take the greater possession of the infectivity , so - called _ super - spreader_. this assumption may fail to mimic some cases in the real world where the relation between degree and infectivity is not simply equal @xcite .",
    "the first example is that , in most of the existing peer - to - peer distributed systems , although their long - term communicating connectivity shows the scale - free characteristic @xcite , all peers have identical capabilities and responsibilities to communicate at a short term , such as the gnutella networks @xcite .",
    "second , in sexual contact networks , even the hub node has many acquaintances ; he / she has limited capability to contact with others during limited periods @xcite .",
    "third , the referral of a product to potential consumers costs money and time in network marketing processes ( e.g. a salesman has to make phone calls to persuade his social surrounding to buy the product ) .",
    "therefore , the salesman will not make referrals to all his acquaintances @xcite .",
    "the last one , in some email service systems , such as the gmail system schemed out by google @xcite , the clients are assigned by limited capability to invite others to become gmail - user after being invited by an e - mail from another gmail - user .",
    "similar phenomena are common in our daily lives , thus need a further investigation .",
    "in the epidemic contact network , node presents individual and link denotes the potential contacts along which infections can spread .",
    "each individual can be in two discrete states , whether susceptible ( s ) or infected ( i ) . at each time step , the susceptible node which is connected to the infected one will be infected with rate @xmath2 .",
    "meanwhile , infected nodes will be cured to be again susceptible with rate @xmath3 , defining the effective spreading rate as @xmath4 . without losing of generality , we set @xmath5 .",
    "individuals run stochastically through the cycle susceptible - infected - susceptible , which is also the origin of the name , sis .",
    "denote @xmath6 and @xmath7 the density of the susceptible and infected population at the time step @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "then @xmath9    in the standard sis model , each individual will contact all its neighbors once at each time step , thus the infectivity of each node is equal to its degree . in the present model , we assume that every individual has the same infectivity @xmath0 . that is to say , at each time step , each infected individual will generate @xmath0 contacts where @xmath0 is a constant .",
    "multiple contacts to one neighbor are allowed , and the contacts to the infected ones , although without any effect on the epidemic dynamics , are also counted . in this paper , with half nodes infected initially , we run the spreading process for sufficiently long time , and calculate the fraction of infected nodes averaging over the last 1000 steps as the density of infected nodes in the steady stage ( denoted by @xmath10 ) .",
    "all of our simulation results are obtained from averaging over @xmath11 different network realizations , and for each @xmath12 independent runs with different initial configurations .",
    "[ 0.7 ] ( color online ) average value of @xmath10 as a function of the effective spreading rate @xmath13 on a ba network with average degree @xmath14 and network size @xmath15 .",
    "the black points represent the case of standard sis model , and the red , green and blue points correspond to the present model with @xmath16 , 3 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the arrows point at the critical points gained from the simulation .",
    "the insert shows the threshold @xmath17 scaling with @xmath1 , with solid line representing the analytical results.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "let @xmath18 denote the fraction of vertices of degree @xmath19 that are infected at time @xmath8 .",
    "then using the mean - field approximation , the rate equation for the partial densities @xmath18 in a network characterized by a degree distribution @xmath20 can be written as : @xmath21\\sum_{k'}\\frac{p(k'|k ) i_{k'}(t)a}{k'},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the conditional probability that a vertex of degree @xmath19 is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath23 .",

    "then , one obtains @xmath30 to the end , for the critical point where @xmath31 , we get @xmath32 this equation defines the epidemic threshold @xmath33 below which the epidemic prevalence is null , and above which it attains a finite value .",
    "the previous works about epidemic spreading in sf networks present us with a completely new scenario that a highly heterogeneous structure will lead to the absence of any epidemic threshold @xcite , while now , in the present model , it is @xmath1 instead . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the analytical result agrees very well with the simulations .",

    ", the node s infectivity relies strictly on its degree @xmath19 and the threshold is @xmath38 .",
    "since the variance of degrees gets divergent with the increase of @xmath39 , the epidemic propagation on scale - free networks has an obvious size effect @xcite .",
    "however , in the current model , each infected node is just able to contact the same number of neighbors , @xmath0 , rather than its degree .",

    "furthermore , a more precise characterization of the epidemic diffusion through the network can be achieved by studying some convenient quantities in numerical experiments .",

    "immunity , relating to the people s strategies to struggle with the disease epidemics , shows great importance in practice @xcite .",
    "since the current model , which can mimic some real cases more accurately , shows different characters with the standard sis model , it requires some in - depth and detailed investigation about the immunity on this model . as we know",
    ", immunized nodes can not become infected and , therefore , will not transmit the infection to their neighbors . the simplest immunization strategy is to select immunization population completely randomly , so - called _ random immunization _ @xcite .",
    "however , this strategy is inefficient for heterogenous networks .",
    "similar to the preferential attachment mechanism introduced by ba model @xcite , dezs and barabsi proposed the _ proportional immunization _ strategy @xcite ,",
    "in which the immunizing probability of each node is proportional to its degree .",

    ", one can find that the epidemic thresholds under random , proportional and targeted immunizations of random networks are @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . and those of ba networks are @xmath64 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear from the simulation results , even in the current model where the infectivities of large - degree nodes are greatly suppressed , the targeted immunization performs best .",
    "combine with the hierarchical behavior observed in sec .",
    "iv , it strongly indicates that the heterogeneities of degree and infectivity could both contribute to the violent spreading of disease .",
    "hence even for the current model with identical infectivity , the hub nodes play much more important roles in determining the dynamical property .",
    "note that , in this model , for heterogenous networks , the random immunization is more efficient than the standard case , and the threshold @xmath69 is the same for ba and random networks .",
    "actually , the random immunization is implemented by randomly selecting and immunizing @xmath70 nodes on a network of fixed size @xmath39 . at the mean - field level , the presence of uniform immunity will effectively reduce the spreading rate @xmath13 by a factor @xmath71 . according to eq .",

    "the random immunization threshold of standard sis model is given by @xmath75 @xcite .",

    "the spreading velocity under target immunization is the lowest .",
