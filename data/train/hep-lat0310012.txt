    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt ) allows analytic calculations of low - energy qcd processes , results of which are given in terms of a number of undetermined constants , e.g. the gasser - leutwyler coefficients .",
    "these low - energy constants are fundamental qcd parameters that govern physical properties such as masses and scattering amplitudes .",
    "lattice qcd provides a method for determining them from first principles , as long as simulations are done at small enough quark masses that @xmath1pt ( typically at next - to - leading order ) is a good approximation . in practice , however , simulating light dynamical quarks is computationally expensive , and there is a limited range of quark masses where both lattice simulations are feasible and @xmath1pt is applicable .",
    "this situation can be improved using the partially quenched ( pq ) approximation , in which valence quarks ( those which appear in external states ) and sea quarks ( those which appear in loops ) are allowed to have different masses . to ensure that valence quarks exist only in external states , valence quarks have bosonic ghost quark partners of equal mass .",
    "the presence of ghosts means that the pq theory as a whole is unphysical , although the sea quark sector contained within it is physical .",

    "@xcite it is argued that pq qcd can be used for a quantitative determination of the qcd low - energy constants .",
    "the primary assumption is that a generalization of @xmath1pt can be used to describe the low - energy behavior of pq qcd .",
    "this theory , called pq@xmath1pt , must contain all of the operators of unquenched @xmath1pt in order to describe the behavior of the unquenched sector .",
    "quark mass dependence in both @xmath1pt and pq@xmath1pt is explicit , so the coefficients in the lagrangian depend only on the number of quarks .",
    "therefore the coefficients of operators in the unquenched chiral lagrangian are identical to those of corresponding operators in the pq chiral lagrangian for @xmath2 .",

    "@xcite missed one operator in the nlo lagrangian , and explore the consequences .",
    "while the existence of additional operators does not fundamentally change the approach , it does necessitate an elaboration of the program of using pq qcd to determine low energy constants .",
    "the general situation is as follows .",
    "the pq chiral lagrangian contains two types of operators : first , those which , in the sea quark sector , reduce to operators present in the qcd chiral lagrangian , and whose coefficients are thus identical to those in qcd , and , second , operators which vanish in the sea quark sector . we call the latter unphysical operators .",
    "their coefficients are additional unphysical constants needed to describe the low - energy behavior of the pq theory .",
    "they appear first at nlo in chiral perturbation theory , with increasing numbers required as one works at higher order . in general , both types of operator need to be taken into account when matching forms calculated in pq@xmath1pt to pq lattice data .",
    "it turns out , however , that for masses , decay constants and the hairpin vertex , the new operators do not contribute until next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",

    "the unquenched sector alone constrains only two combinations of constants ( one each from the single term proportional to @xmath123 in @xmath124 and @xmath122 ) , although these combinations necessarily involve only physical constants .",
    "consideration of the pq theory adds three unphysical operators , but this  cost \" is outweighed by the benefit of the six additional constraints from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nnloanalytic ] ) . and @xmath122 , rather than four , because the first two terms collapse into a single term for degenerate sea quarks .",
    "] in addition , using the pq theory one can add more values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 to the fit at relatively small computational expense .",
    "if one uses non - degenerate sea quarks then only the second benefit of partial quenching applies .",
    "this is because , even in the unquenched sector , one can , in principle , determine four of the five @xmath115 for both pgb masses and decay - constants , using a number of choices for the sea quark masses . :",
    "@xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 . ] moving to the pq theory gives two more constraints but at the cost of three unphysical operators .",
    "nevertheless , we suspect that this cost will be easily outweighed by the additional data points that one can obtain in the pq theory .",
    "in this paper we have discussed a complication to the program of using simulations of unphysical pq theories to obtain physical low energy constants .",
    "we find that there are operators in pq@xmath1pt which vanish when restricted to the physical , unquenched sector of the theory .",
    "there is one such unphysical operator in the nlo lagrangian @xmath28 , and three in the zero and two derivative part of @xmath110 .",
    "generically , we expect the number of unphysical operators to increase with the order of the calculation .",
    "their presence is related to the fact that correlation functions in the unquenched sector involve linear combinations of quark contractions , while in the larger pq theory one can determine each contraction separately .    dealing with this complication is , in principle , straightforward .",
    "the contributions from unphysical operators can be disentangled from those of physical operators as long as one considers enough quantities in the fits .",
    "the extent of this complication will depend on the example being considered .",
    "for the quantities we have studied in detail , the pgb masses and decay constants , the new @xmath128 operator @xmath121 does not contribute at tree level to pgb masses and decay constants , and so one does not need to include it at all until one works at nnlo .    as a case study in how to deal with the complication of unphysical operators ,",
    "we have outlined a strategy for how one could , in principle , determine and subtract the nnlo contributions of @xmath129 to pgb properties .",
    "our idea is to determine its coefficient using unphysical scattering processes , to which @xmath121 contributes at the first non - vanishing order , which is nlo in @xmath1pt .",
    "then , when doing a nnlo fit to the pgb properties , one can subtract the contribution from @xmath121 , the form of which we have calculated . of course , any such fit would require all other nnlo terms , including two - loop contributions with vertices from @xmath130 , and these are not yet available for the pq theory .",
    "we have also considered the more difficult question of how to separate the contributions from the unphysical operators in @xmath110 .",
    "the difference here is that these operators contribute to pgb masses and decay constants at tree level , so their coefficients appear in combination with those of the physical nnlo operators .",
    "one must therefore rely on the general strategy of calculating enough quantities to constrain all the coefficients , both physical and unphysical .",
    "clearly , extending the determination of low energy constants to nnlo in the meson sector is a significant undertaking , requiring extensive @xmath1pt calculations beyond those presently available , and consideration of many quantities in addition to pgb masses and decay constants .",
    "if such a program is undertaken , pq simulations can play an important role . while they introduce a few additional unknown constants , they provide both additional constraints on low energy constants from the extra functions of valence masses that are available , and , most importantly , the possibility of additional , relatively cheap , data points to include in the fits .    finally , we take this opportunity to reiterate the purpose of simulating pq qcd .",
    "the intent is _ not _ to study it as an approximation to , or a model of , qcd , for it is an unphysical theory , but rather to use it as a tool to more easily extract the low energy constants of qcd .",
    "once these are determined , they can be used to calculate pgb processes in qcd , including those that are not easily accessible to lattice calculations .",
    "the unphysical nature of pq qcd is manifested in several ways , for example by the presence of double poles in neutral propagators , and by the inability to define decay and scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed here another unphysical feature , namely the presence of additional operators in pq@xmath1pt which do not contribute in the unquenched sector . while all these features do complicate the use of pq qcd , we have argued that these complications can be overcome and that pq simulations remain an important element of the lattice practitioner s toolkit .",
