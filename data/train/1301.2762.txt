    "symbiotic stars are long - period interacting binaries consisting of a cool visual primary and a hot compact secondary component accreting matter from the atmosphere of its companion . their spectral variability is determined from both the orbital motion and the outburst events of the hot component which are often accompanied by intensive loss of mass in the form of optically thick shells , stellar wind outflow and bipolar collimated jets .",
    "the nature of the collimated jets is subject of intensive theoretical investigation and the view they represent outflow from an accreting compact object is widely accepted @xcite .",
    "the collimated bipolar outflow , however , could arise due to a stellar wind , if mechanism of collimation is available in the system .",
    "such a mechanism can be related to disc - like formation surrounding the white dwarf which provides a small opening angle of the outflowing jets .",
    "the z  and system is considered as a prototype of the classical symbiotic stars .",
    "it consists of a normal cool giant of spectral type m4.5 @xcite , a hot compact object with temperature higher than 10@xmath4  k @xcite and an extended surrounding nebula partly photoionized by the hot component .",
    "its orbital period is 7588 , which is based on both photometric @xcite and radial velocity @xcite data .",
    "the last active phase of z  and began at the end of 2000 august @xcite and continues up to now including seven optical eruptions .",
    "the maxima of the light during this phase were in 2000 december , 2002 november , 2004 september , 2006 july , 2008 january , 2010 january and 2012 january ( * ? ? ? * aavso data ) . a scenario for interpretation of the line spectrum of z  and during this active phase containing two stages of the evolution of the accreting compact object",
    "was suggested in the works of @xcite .",
    "it is supposed that a thin accretion disc from accretion of a stellar wind exists in the system and the observed two velocity regime of mass outflow from the compact object during the first outburst of the active phase is explained with a collision of one part of the outflowing material with the disc and decrease of its velocity .",
    "the first outburst ( and every following one ) gives birth to conditions a disc - like envelope surrounding the accretion disc to form in the system , which can collimate the outflowing material during the following outbursts and the growth of the collimated outflow in parallel with the development of the wind is thus explained . during the first outburst of z  and in 20002002 two velocity regime of the mass outflow was observed . during its 20062007 outburst development of a stellar wind together with a bipolar collimated outflow",
    "was observed on the other hand .",
    "some other classical symbiotic stars have similar behavior during their active phases .",
    "the mean aim of this work is selected lines of some other symbiotic binaries during their active phases to be considered and to show that their profiles can be interpreted in the framework of the scenario proposed for z  and .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were obtained with the photometrics ccd camera mounted on the coud spectrograph of the 2 m ritchey  chrtien - coud ( rcc ) telescope of the rozhen national astronomical observatory .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath5  px@xmath6 on all occasions . when more than one exposure was taken per night",
    ", the spectra were added with the aim of improving the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the iraf package was used for the data reduction as well as for obtaining the dispersion curve , calculating the radial velocities and equivalent widths .",
    "the line fluxes were dereddened on using the extinction law in the paper by @xcite .",
    "we proposed a model for interpretation of the line spectrum of z  and during its 20002012 active phase @xcite .",
    "it was concluded that as a result of accretion of the stellar wind from the giant star a thin accretion disk , located in the orbital plane , forms around the compact object in the quiescent state of the system .",
    "the estimates of the size and mass of the disc show its innermost part can be optically thick in the quiescent state . during the active phase an accretion disc with a mass of @xmath7@xmath8 per cent of its",
    "initial mass exists , too ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    during the first outburst the outflowing material with a high velocity collides with the accretion disc . as a result ,",
    "the ejecta velocity decreases in the region of the orbital plane and does not change at higher stellar latitudes ( fig .",
    "[ model1 ] , left panel ) .",
    "the decrease of the velocity leads to an increase of the density and the level of the observed photosphere resides further away from the star . at higher stellar latitudes the level of the photosphere resides closer to the star . in this way an optically thick disc - like shell forms in the orbital plane , which plays the role of the observed photosphere",
    "this shell occults the hot compact object and since the shell has a lower effective temperature @xcite it is responsible for redistribution of the continuum energy and a growth of the optical flux of the star .",
    "the observed p  cyg absorption is related to this shell ( see fig .",
    "[ model1 ] , right panel ) .        during the active phase the wind of the compact object `` strips '' the accretion disc and ejects some part of its mass .",
    "at the end of each outburst some part of the ejected mass locates in the potential well of the compact object .",
    "after the cessation of the wind it begins to accrete again . because of conservation of the initial angular momentum a disc - like envelope forms surrounding the disc which envelope is located at a greater distance from the orbital plane than the accretion disc itself .",
    "the existence of centrifugal barrier leads to the appearance of two hollow cones with a small opening angle ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) around the axis of rotation ( see fig .",
    "[ model2 ] , left panel ) @xcite .        during the first outburst ,",
    "disc - like envelope does not exist .",
    "the following outbursts during the active phase , the extended disc - like envelope can collimate the wind , which in this case occupies only the two hollow cones and bipolar outflow forms ( fig .",
    "[ model2 ] , left panel ) .",
    "this outflow is observed as high velocity satellite components , situated on either side of the main peak of the emission line .",
    "their presence in the spectrum depends on the density of both the disc - like envelope and the outflowing material .",
    "these components will appear only if the density of the disc - like envelope is high enough to provide collimation and the mass - loss rate of the outbursting component is also high . according to our model they are expected to be observed during outbursts accompanied by mass - loss at high rates and preceded by similar strong outburst .    the observed broad emission components indicating an optically thin stellar wind with a high velocity appear close to the compact object where the outflowing material moves in all directions ( fig .",
    "[ model2 ] , right panel ) . the gas outflowing close to the surface of the cone , whose velocity is lower than that along to the cone axis , can contribute to these emission components too .",
    "depending on the inclination angle of the orbit and the opening angle of the cone the outflow close to the cone surface can have a radial velocity , which makes it able to emit at wavelengths far away from the center of the satellite emission .",

    "the absolute flux of the line was calculated using its equivalent width and the continuum flux at its position .",
    "the continuum flux was obtained using linear interpolation of the b and v photometric fluxes taken on close nights from the paper of @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the continuum flux is not more than @xmath57 per cent .",
    "the b and v fluxes were corrected for the interstellar reddening of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the total flux of the line , which is a sum of the fluxes of the two components , is @xmath59 erg@xmath60s@xmath6 , which gives emission measure of @xmath61 ( d/1.7  kpc)@xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "this emission measure was calculated with using a recombination coefficient for case b , corresponding to electron temperature of @xmath64  k and a number density of @xmath65  @xmath63 @xcite since according to @xcite the electron temperature and the mean density in the close vicinity of the compact object during outburst are about @xmath66  k and @xmath65  @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "accepting such a density , we obtain a radius of 3.43 @xmath67 10@xmath68 ( d/1.7  kpc)@xmath69 cm of the spherical emitting volume .",
    "if the broad component was produced only by electron scattering it would be risen in a region with an optical thickness of @xmath70 . using this value and a number density of @xmath65  @xmath63",
    ", we derive a radius of @xmath71(d/1.7  kpc)@xmath69  cm , which is very close to that of @xmath72(d/1.7  kpc)@xmath69  cm based on the observed emission measure .",
    "this means that the broad component could be due only to electron scattering .",
    "however , we should consider other mechanisms of line broadening too since the broad component is possible to be formed by more than one of them .",
    "an emission line similar to the @xmath14686 broad component can be radiated by a small accretion disc with low luminosity appeared from wind accretion and rotating around the compact object with keplerian velocity . to consider this possibility we need the size of the outbursting compact component of ag  dra .",
    "according to the results of the analysis of the continuum energy distribution of the ag  dra system at the time of its 2006 light maximum ( skopal , private communication ) the outbursting component maintained the same features of a compact object with a radius of @xmath73 like during the 1994 light maximum .",
    "this radius , however , is for a distance of @xmath74  kpc .",
    "we use a distance of @xmath75  kpc according to the paper by @xcite and the radius in this case should be increased to @xmath76 . then for masses of @xmath77@xmath78 @xcite a keplerian velocity of @xmath79@xmath80  kms@xmath6 is obtained .",
    "this velocity is smaller than the velocity of @xmath81  kms@xmath6 based on the hwzi of the broad component . since",
    ", however , the distance to the system is obtained with some uncertainty and it could be smaller than @xmath75  kpc , the radius on its side could be smaller than @xmath82 and the keplerian velocity  greater than calculated one .",
    "then our supposition for a disc origin of this component can not be thus rejected .",
    "another possibility is the broad component of the @xmath14686 line to be emitted by a high - velocity stellar wind .",
    "according to @xcite the hot compact object in the ag  dra system expands during active phases .",
    "then we suppose that the broad component can be emitted by an optically thin stellar wind too . in this case",
    "we should accept all three possibilities  notably that a scattering by free electrons as well as emission of keplerian accretion disc and optically thin stellar wind give rise to a broad component .",
    "then the wind should collide with the disc which can make possible a disc - like formation surrounding the compact object to appear in the system as in the case of z  and .",
    "this disc - like formation , however , could be optically thin and difficult to be detected observationally .",
    "we consider profiles of selected lines of several symbiotic systems which contain high - velocity satellite components indicating bipolar collimated outflow from the outbursting compact object in these systems along with blueshifted absorption indicating p  cyg wind from the same object .",
    "we interpret these profiles in the framework of the scenario proposed for explanation of the line profiles of z  and during its 20002012 active phase @xcite .",
    "the profile of the h@xmath0 line of z  and during its 2006 outburst consisted of four groups of components : central narrow emission of nebular type , broad emission component indicating optically thin stellar wind with a high velocity of @xmath83  kms@xmath6 , very broad multicomponent p  cyg absorption , and satellite emission components situated on both sides of the central peak of the line with a velocity of more than @xmath84  kms@xmath6 , indicating bipolar collimated outflow .",
    "both satellite components were observed only during the time when the intensity of the h@xmath2 satellite components was maximal .",
    "the profile of the h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 lines of the hen  3 - 1341 system during its 19982004 outburst had high velocity satellite emission components on both sides of the central peak of the line with a velocity of @xmath85  kms@xmath6 , indicating bipolar collimated outflow from the outbursting compact object .",
    "the same components presented in the profile of the helium triplet line with wavelength @xmath15876 , but this line contained broad two - component p  cyg absorption in addition @xcite .    the profile of the h@xmath3 line of the bf  cyg system during its 20062012 outburst contained satellite components with a velocity of @xmath35  kms@xmath6 situated on both sides of the line center indicating bipolar collimated outflow from the outbursting compact object .",
    "the blueshifted satellite component was an absorption one at the more early stage of the outburst which after that went into emission .",
    "at the time when the blueshifted component appeared as absorption , an other absorption of p  cyg type at a velocity position of @xmath86  kms@xmath6 presented in the spectrum .",
    "a second p  cyg absorption with lower velocity of @xmath7@xmath41  kms@xmath6 was seen at same time .",
    "the h@xmath2 line had weak emission peaks / shoulders with the same velocity of @xmath35  kms@xmath6 situated on both sides of the central emission like the h@xmath3 satellite components .",
    "the line profiles of the z  and , hen  3 - 1341 , and bf  cyg systems are considered in the light of the model about the second stage of the evolution of the accreting compact object which stage is related to the strong requrrent outbursts of z  and .",
    "it is supposed that a geometrically thick disk - like formation surrounding the compact object exists in the system which plays a role of mechanism of collimation .",
    "the high - velocity stellar wind collides with this formation and collimated outflow forms after the collision .",
    "the region of the wind which is projected onto the effective photosphere ( pseudophotosphere ) of the outbursting compact object gives rise to the p  cyg absorption .",
    "the spectral lines of the symbiotic binary ag  dra did not contain indication of collimated outflow .",
    "the @xmath14686 line had a broad emission component in whose appearance three processes can take place : stellar wind , rotation of an accretion disc , and electron scattering .",
    "we supposed that the stellar wind is possible to collide with the disc but this collision does not lead to the appearance of optically thick shell occulting the outbursting compact object as in the z  and system .",
