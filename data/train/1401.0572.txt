    "<S> the experimental observations of sequential double ionization ( sdi ) of ar [ a. n. pfeiffer _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ , nature phys . * 7 * , 428 ( 2011 ) ] , such as the four - peak momentum distribution and the ionization time of the first and second electrons , are investigated and reproduced with a quantum model by including and excluding the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation effect . based on the comparison of experiment and simulation , the role of @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation in sdi is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the inclusion of @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation is necessary to reproduce the momentum distribution of electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> tunneling ionization of atoms , molecules and semiconductors exposed to strong laser fields is one of the most fundamental quantum processes and has been of significant interest over the past several decades @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theories @xcite have been well established for single electron ionization based on the keldysh frame @xcite . by numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) with single - active - electron ( sae ) , tong and </S>",
    "<S> lin also proposed a more accurate formula @xcite , which draws up the well - known ammosov - delone - krainov ionization rate @xcite to the numerical simulation via an empirical correction factor , thereby predicting the ionization rate quite precisely .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , for double ( or multielectron ) ionization , the underlying dynamics become more complicated and have not been fully understood so far . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally recognized that two electrons can be ionized either in a non - sequential or sequential process @xcite . in the former mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> so - called non - sequential double ionization ( nsdi ) , the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation plays an essential role and the nsdi yield is remarkably enhanced compared with the independent - electron ionization theory @xcite . in the latter mechanism , so - called sequential double ionization ( sdi ) , two electrons are released independently step by step , therefore the sdi yield can be simulated by using ionization theory based on sae . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , recent experiments @xcite have doubted the validity of independent - electron approximation in the sdi regime . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , fleischer _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite reported an angular correlation between the first and second ionization steps . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , pfeiffer _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ measured the release time of sdi for ar by using the attoclock technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured release time is in good agreement with the prediction of tong - lin s formula for the first electron , but is much earlier than the theoretical prediction for the second electron . </S>",
    "<S> such a finding has attracted significant interests immediately . </S>",
    "<S> zhou _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have reproduced the experimental release time with a classical model by including the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation . </S>",
    "<S> later , wang _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite argued that the release time can be successfully explained with a similar classical model by properly adopting the soft - core parameter but excluding the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation , which implies that @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation is not essential in sdi .    even though the classical model is robust , which has been demonstrated extensively in previous investigations @xcite , and </S>",
    "<S> also provides a straightforward interpretation with electron trajectory analysis @xcite , the physical picture of sdi is still unclear . </S>",
    "<S> actually , to produce the experimental data , a scaling factor is adopted in @xcite to shift the simulation curve . </S>",
    "<S> strictly speaking , the experiment has not been reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> several curial questions remain : does the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation play an essential role in sdi ? </S>",
    "<S> what is its influence and how can its effect be observed ? </S>",
    "<S> can we find another indicator to identify the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation , except for ionization times and angular correlation @xcite ? to clarify these questions , we investigate sdi of ar in an elliptically polarized field by using a quantum model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation does affect sdi . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to that a small part of the electrons ionize in a correlated way . </S>",
    "<S> this effect influences the observed ionization time only slightly , but it affects the overall shape of the momentum distributions .    a complete description of a two - electron system in an elliptically polarized field requires to simulate the motion for each electron in at least two dimensions , which is almost impossible at present @xcite . to overcome the enormous computational challenge , the so - called crapola quantum model @xcite was introduced , which has excellently reproduced the `` knee '' structure of nsdi @xcite . in this model , the total wave function is written , @xmath1 in the high - intensity elliptically polarized field , the electron is quickly removed from the core and the recollision is significantly suppressed </S>",
    "<S> then we can assume that the overlap between the two electrons is sufficiently small for the exchange term and can be negligible in comparison to the coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> thus only the first term needs to be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolutions of the first ( i.e. , outer electron , @xmath2 ) and second ( i.e. , inner electron , @xmath3 ) electrons are described by @xmath4\\psi_n(\\mathbf { r}_n , t),\\ ] ] where atomic units ( a.u . ) </S>",

    "<S> was assumed to move in a static effective potential due to the nucleus and inner electrons , i.e. , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> for the second electron , the interaction with the first electron was taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> thus , v@xmath14 includes a static effective potential due to the nucleus plus a time - dependent potential due to the first electron , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the soft - core parameters for the e - ion and @xmath0-@xmath0 interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the second electron is correlated with the first one through the time - dependent term of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ e3 ] . we could include or exclude the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation by setting @xmath19 or 0 . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> , we adjust the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation strength by changing @xmath18 to identify its influence . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the crapola quantum model , the correlation of the first electron on the second is taken into account while its counteractive , i.e. , the time - dependent potential of the second electron on the first electron , is not explicitly included . in order to remedy this seemingly unreasonable treatment , </S>",
    "<S> we performed other calculations where the time - dependent potential of the second electron on the first electron is also explicitly taken into account . </S>",

    "<S> the difference between figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) and ( b ) is remarkable . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution including @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation is fatter than that excluding @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the result including @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation agrees better with the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> this feature can be more clearly seen in the reduced spectra , which are respectively obtained from the momentum spectra of the first electron @xmath39 and the second electron @xmath25 . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](d ) , for both electrons , the widths of the spectra excluding @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation are narrower than the experimental data . while for the spectra including @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation , the widths are in agreement with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> in order to further confirm that the broadening of the reduced spectra originates from the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation , we performed other calculations where the strength of @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation is enhanced by decreasing the soft - parameter @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the supplementary material @xcite , the reduced spectra become wider for both electrons for a smaller value of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> note that a fat radial momentum distribution is also obtained by the crapola model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that sdi indeed is influenced by @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation and this influence leaves imprint on the electron momentum spectra .    as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) and 3(b ) , the peaks of the momentum spectra do not change dramatically when @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation is excluded or included . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the mean value of radial momentum is not dramatically influenced by @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation . in the attoclock experiment @xcite , the ionization time </S>",
    "<S> is extracted from the radial momenta . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the influence of the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation on the averaged ionization time is not very effective . </S>",
    "<S> similar remarks also can be observed for the 33-fs pulse . </S>",
    "<S> this feature also explains the puzzle why the ionization time can be reproduced with the classical model either including or excluding the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation @xcite .    . </S>",
    "<S> uncorrelated model and revised correlation model are adopted in ( a ) and ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines with dots and the dashed lines represent the vector potential of the laser field and the radial momentum , respectively , width=226 ]    the origin of the broadening of the reduced momentum spectra is related to the time intervals when the first and the second ionizations occur . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4](a ) shows the ionization rate as a function of time at 3 pw/@xmath35 for the 7-fs pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the bold and thin solid lines correspond to the first and second electrons without @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation . </S>",
    "<S> because the laser intensity is much higher than the saturation intensity , the ionization is confined in a single cycle around t@xmath40 and t@xmath14 at the ascending part of the pulse , respectively . after ionization , </S>",
    "<S> the electrons are accelerated by the laser field and finally released with a momentum of p@xmath37 and p@xmath36 as shown in fig . [ fig4](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> but because of no correlation , the second electron is not freed when @xmath41 and the first ionization process is already finished when @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation is accounted for [ fig . [ fig4](b ) ] , the centra of the ionization time ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) for both electrons almost do not change . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the above results that the ionization time is not effectively influenced by the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation . </S>",
    "<S> however , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) , when @xmath41 , small percentage of the second electron starts to be released and also small percentage of the first electron is released at @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the ionization windows of the first and second ionization processes become broader than those excluding the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the long ionization window broadens the width of the momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , because the first electron quickly moves away after ionization , its correlation with the second electron drops quickly . </S>",
    "<S> only a small percentage of the first and second electrons can be ionized in a correlated way . by increasing the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation </S>",
    "<S> , larger percentage of the electrons can be ionized in a correlated way and the momentum spectra will be further broadened as shown in the supplementary material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the width of the momentum spectrum , which is closely related to the ionization window , exhibits the faint details of @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation in sdi .    in conclusion , sdi of ar subjected to elliptically polarized pulses is investigated using quantum models . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation indeed slightly shifts the ionization time , but its influence is not crucial to explain the experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , uncertainties in the focal volume averaging also influence the apparent ionization times . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to decisively reveal the role of @xmath0-@xmath0 correlations based on the ionization timing data alone . </S>",
    "<S> however , our simulations show that the @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation broadens the time windows for the first and second ionizations . </S>",
    "<S> though this effect could not be distinguished in the ionization time of the second electron , it affects the momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the signature of @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation can be identified in the width of the electron momentum distribution . by comparing with the experiment @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the width of the electron momentum distribution for 7-fs pulse agrees well with the simulation including fair @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation , which indeed indicates the exist of @xmath0-@xmath0 correlation in sdi . </S>",
    "<S> the subtle features of momentum distribution require further experimental measurements with low noise and high accuracy . </S>"
