    "there is now a wealth of observational evidence linking long duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( prompt emission lasting @xmath6  s ) with the collapse of a massive star  ( collapsar model ;  e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this includes the underlying supernova features in the afterglow of some grbs  [ e.g.  grb  980425 @xcite , grb  030329 @xcite and grb  060218 @xcite ] , and the association between grb host galaxies and high - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-ray energy emission of grbs is unaffected by dust and gas in the intervening interstellar medium , which combined with the vast energy released during the initial explosion , allows them to be detected out to very high redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these two facts give grbs the potential to be highly powerful tools with which to trace the star formation history ( sfh ) in an unbiased way .",
    "furthermore , the longer lived , lower energy afterglows light up their host galaxies , albeit for only a brief time ( on the order of weeks ) , providing invaluable insight into the chemical makeup of these galaxies that would otherwise be unattainable in a majority of cases ; certainly at high redshifts .    to fully maximise the potential that grbs offer as cosmic probes the selection effects present in grb studies need to be known , such as the stellar populations that they trace and the properties of their host galaxies",
    ". infra - red observations of long grb host galaxies taken with _ spitzer _ indicate that they are not strong starburst galaxies , nor are they particularly dusty @xcite .",
    "this is in conflict with expectations from the collapsar model , which predicts grbs to occur in regions of active star formation that are heavily enshrouded by dust .",
    "this mismatch between observations and theory could very possibly be the result of selection effects , whereby the near infra - red ( nir ) to ultra violet ( uv ) afterglow of grbs in dusty galaxies are extinguished , thus reducing the chance of identifying the host .",
    "further detailed analysis of grb environments is important to determine the range in host galaxy properties , and , fundamentally , to provide a better understanding of our observations and the limitations that they present .    due to the broadband power law spectral behaviour of grb afterglows ,",
    "the effects of absorbing dust and gas in the local environment on the grb spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be well identified . in the analysis of x - ray and optical afterglow spectra for eight grbs ,",
    "@xcite found evidence for high column densities of gas in the grb local environment that were comparable with those observed in giant molecular clouds .",
    "furthermore , they found the optical extinction to be 10 - 100 times smaller than expected given the column densities .",
    "@xcite extended this sample and found the ratio of host galaxy column density to visual extinction to be an order of magnitude larger that that observed in the milky way ( mw ) , and also greater than that in the small magellanic clouds ( smc ) and large magellanic clouds ( lmc ) .",
    "prompted by theoretical studies that indicate that the intense radiation emitted by a grb should destroy small dust grains out to radii of around @xmath8  pc [ e.g.  fruchter , krolik & rhoads ( 2001 ) ; perna & lazzati ( 2002 ) ; perna , lazzati & fiore ( 2003 ) ] , the large gas - to - dust ratio was taken to be evidence of the destruction of dust in the surrounding vicinity of the burst , thus reducing the visual extinction observed .",
    "@xcite also found little evidence of the strong 2175    galactic absorption feature in their optical - nir spectral analysis .",
    "instead they found the sed to be best fit by a model in which the host galaxy has an smc or starburst galaxy dust extinction law , which has no such absorption feature .",
    "more recently kann , klose & zeh ( 2006 ) analysed the afterglow spectral energy distributions in the optical and nir bands on a larger sample of 30 pre-_swift _",
    "grbs , and also found the smc extinction curve to provide a better fit to the spectra than the mw or lmc extinction curves .",

    "( 2005 ) ] on - board the _ swift _  spacecraft @xcite provide grb afterglow seds without the need to extrapolate data to the same epoch .",
    "this capability is unique to _ swift _  and the accurate broadband spectral modelling that is possible with this provides an important data set to compare to previous multi - wavelength grb samples . in this paper",
    "we model the seds of a sample of _ swift _  grbs with afterglows detected by both the xrt and uvot to investigate the rest - frame visual extinction and soft x - ray absorption at the grb host galaxy .",
    "this provides an indication of the dust and gas content in the local environment of the grb , which we compare to the environment of the mw , the lmc and the smc .",
    "the effects of the selection bias that is introduced by analysing only those grbs with x - ray and optical afterglows is addressed by using our results to examine the dust in the local environments of grbs that have no uvot detected afterglow .",
    "our results have implications for the role that dust plays in accounting for the lack of an uv / optical afterglow detection in @xmath5 of grbs observed by the uvot .",
    "in section  [ sec : anlys ] we present the grb sample and describe the x - ray and uv / optical data reduction and analysis and in section  [ sec : mod ] we describe the models that we used to fit the data .",
    "we present the results from our spectral modelling and discuss their implications in sections  [ sec : rslts ] and [ sec : disc ] , and also investigate how grbs that have no uv / optical afterglow detected by uvot may be affected by dust .",

    "seds at a single - epoch were produced for a total of seven bursts .",
    "this epoch was chosen to be 1  hour after the onset of the initial prompt emission ( time t ) for four of the bursts ( grb  050318 , grb  050525 , grb  050802 and grb  060512 ) .",
    "for the remaining three grbs ( grb  050824,grb  051111 and grb  060418 ) the seds were produced at a time t+2hrs due to a lack of data at t+1hr , resulting from spacecraft observing constraints .    the grbs in our sample were chosen on the basis that they had afterglows detected by both the xrt and uvot instruments and a spectroscopic redshift with @xmath14 .",
    "bursts for which the photometry was considered to be too poor to provide useful constraints on the spectral fitting were not used .",

    "were used in the spectral analysis .",

    "the value that we determine in our spectral analysis for @xmath17  is an equivalent neutral hydrogen column density that results from the amount of soft x - ray absorption in the spectrum , where solar abundances are assumed .",
    "this is dominated primarily by oxygen k - shell absorption @xcite . to distinguish between the equivalent neutral hydrogen column density determined from the x - ray absorption and the true neutral hydrogen column density",
    ", we use the notation @xmath18  to refer to the former .",
    "the results from our spectral analysis are provided in table  [ tab : powsedfits ] and table  [ tab : bknpsedfits ] for a power law and a broken power law fit , respectively . for five grbs",
    "a broken power law provided little improvement to the fit with an f - test probability p @xmath19 . for grb  050802 and grb  060418 a spectral break at 12  kev and @xmath20  kev , respectively , improved the goodness of fit of the model with an f - test probability ranging from 0.003 to @xmath21 for grb  050802 and from 0.02 to @xmath22 for grb  060418 , depending on the model .",
    "however , the column density and the dust extinction at the host galaxy do not change significantly between the two continuum fits , remaining consistent to @xmath23 .    for the purpose of this paper , where we are interested in the properties of the grb local environment ,",
    "the factors of importance are the dust extinction law that best fits the grb afterglows and the relation between the column density and visual - extinction in the grb local environment .",
    "we find that the former of these is not affected by the models that we use to fit the continuum , and there is no significant change in the ratio between the host galaxy column density and rest - frame visual extinction .",

    "typically the smc model results in the smallest @xmath2  in the host galaxy and the mw model in the largest .",
    "this general trend is to be expected given the difference in fuv extinction observed in the three curves .",
    "the mw extinction law is the shallowest of the three extinction curves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : extcurves ] ) and , in particular , has the least amount of dust - absorption in the fuv for a given @xmath2 . a spectral model with a mw extinction law , therefore , requires a larger @xmath2  to fit the same data .",
    "although the x - ray column density and uv / optical extinction are independent components in the fit , the fitted value of @xmath18  depends on the spectral index , which in turn depends on the uv / optical extinction",
    ". the best - fit x - ray column density will , therefore , vary between extinction models .",
    "typically the mw model requires a steeper spectral index to compensate for the reduced amount of fuv extinction , and this consequently results in larger absorption in the soft x - ray .",
    "regardless of these differences the hydrogen equivalent column density determined from our spectral modelling is generally consistent at the @xmath25 level . in the case of grb  050802",
    "the column density is consistent at the @xmath23 level between dust models .",
    "to further investigate the model dependence between the amount of x - ray absorption and dust extinction in the local environment of the grb we show the confidence contours of @xmath26 vs. @xmath18  for the best fit power law models to each grb in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfnhavcontour ] .",
    "for the most part the contours are fairly circular , indicating that there is no significant correlation between @xmath18  and @xmath2  in our spectral modelling .",
    "we also tried fitting the x - ray data alone to make sure that the uv / optical data were not in any way skewing the column densities .",

    "this shows the robustness of our method .",
    "six of the seven grbs in our sample were best fit by the smc or lmc model , with the mw model rejected with at least 97% confidence for four of these ( grb  050318 , 050525 , 051111 and grb  060512 ) .",
    "for grb  050824 and grb  060418 the mw model is rejected with 84% and 87% , respectively .",
    "the relatively small amount of extinguishing dust in the circumburst environment of those two latter grbs , indicated by the best fit @xmath2 , is likely to be the cause for the smaller distinction between the spectral models .",
    "although the distinction in the goodness of fit between the smc and lmc models is small , the smc model provides the best fit to five of the grbs in the sample , and only grb  060418 is best fit by the lmc model ; @xmath27 for 75 degrees of freedom ( dof ) compared to @xmath28 for 75 dof for the smc model .",
    "the afterglow of grb  050525 was detected in all six lenticular uvot filters @xcite , and grb  050824 @xcite and grb  060418 @xcite had an afterglow detection in all but the bluest uv filter ( @xmath29 ) .",

    ", the lack of an optical afterglow detection in the bluest filters could either be the result of ly@xmath9 blanketing or high levels of dust extinction blueward of @xmath35   .",
    "grb  050318 and grb  051111 have @xmath2  values that lie at the higher end of the distribution observed in the sample , with best fit parameters @xmath2  @xmath36  mag and @xmath2  @xmath37  mag , respectively , if the smc model is used .",
    "grb  050824 and grb  060418 , on the other hand , have at least half this amount in rest - frame extinction if the smc model is used ( @xmath2  = @xmath3 and @xmath2  = @xmath38  mag , respectively ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath2  and the number of filters in which the afterglow is detected could indicate that it is dust present in the local environment of these grbs that contributes to the observed dimness of their uv afterglow .",
    "grb  060512 was a low redshift burst [ z=0.4428 ; @xcite ] , eliminating neutral hydrogen absorption as the cause for the lack of an uv afterglow detection .",
    "the best fit is provided by the smc model ( @xmath39 for 20 dof ) yielding a host galaxy extinction of @xmath2  @xmath40  mag , which is comparable to that observed in grb  050318 and grb  051111 .",
    "this , therefore , provides further support to the hypothesis whereby dust in the local environment of the grb blocks a large fraction of the uv flux emitted .",
    "in contrast to the other bursts discussed in this section , grb  050525 had very small amounts of local absorption and extinction . however , good quality data resulting from the proximity [ z=0.606 ; @xcite ] and brightness of this burst in the uv and optical bands constrained well the spectral fits , and provided a distinction between them .",
    "the afterglow sed was best fit by the smc model ( @xmath41 for 33 dof ) .",
    "grb  050802 is the only burst in our sample where the goodness of the spectral fit is improved with the mw model , ( @xmath42 for 81 dof ) .",
    "the sed of grb  050802 flattens out at longer wavelengths ( fig .",

    "the @xmath43 of the lmc model fit is still acceptable , with @xmath44 for 81 dof , although it is rejected at the 90% confidence level in contrast to the mw model , which is only rejected at the 71% confidence level .",
    "the 2175    absorption feature falls in the uvot wavelength range for the grb sample used in this paper , and its prominence in the grb seds provides information on the graphite content of small grains in the surrounding circumburst material .",
    "the origin of the 2175    feature is most likely to be carbonaceous material such as small spherical particles of graphite ( @xmath45  nm ) , which have a strong feature at this wavelength and of a similar width @xcite .",
    "its strength in the mw extinction curve would require @xmath46 of the solar abundance in carbon to be present in small particles of this size @xcite , whereas its absence in the smc extinction curve can be explained by a difference in the relative abundances of graphite and silicate grains @xcite .",
    "the evidence for the 2175    absorption dip in the sed of grb  050802 suggests a larger abundance of small carbonaceous grains in the surrounding environment of this burst than is the case for the other bursts .",
    "a few other grbs have also shown evidence for such a feature [ e.g.  grb  970508 ; @xcite , grb  991216 ; @xcite ] , although the usual absence of this feature in the spectra of grbs indicate it to be rare in grb host galaxies .",
    "the amount of dust extinction observed in the afterglow of grbs is a measure of the column density of dust grains responsible for the absorption of uv and optical photons , and the ratio between the x - ray column density and extinction gives an estimate of the gas - to - dust ratio in the surrounding environment of the grb . in fig .",

    "furthermore , @xcite s work shows that if the dust and gas extends out to a few tens of parsecs the @xmath2  and @xmath18  measured local to the grb do not change significantly .",

    "@xcite found the grb prompt emission to be well modelled by a smoothed , broken , power law with a soft and hard spectral index , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , and spectral break @xmath70 . those grbs with no spectral information are assumed to have a band spectrum , and their @xmath68@xmath69 is taken from the average of 54 values , each computed with a different set of ( @xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath70 ) .",

    "[ fig : evsav ] is not significant , with the log of @xmath68  and @xmath2  showing a correlation coefficient of only @xmath71 with a null - hypothesis probability of p=0.60 .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite , whose analysis showed a sample of 23 pre-_swift _  grbs to show no correlation between the isotropic @xmath7-ray emitted energies and the optical luminosities .",
    "this , therefore , suggests that any dust - destruction caused by the grb intense radiation is not significant enough to affect greatly their observed extinction properties , as already indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : avnh ] and discussed in section [ subsec : nhav ] .      by imposing the criteria that the selected grbs have a uv / optical afterglow detected by uvot , a bias is introduced that favours afterglows with low source - frame extinction .",
    "the determined range in host - galaxy extinction may , therefore , represent the low end of the extinction distribution .",
    "given the association of grbs with star formation , it is likely that the lack of an optical counterpart in some bursts is due to large amounts of dust in the host galaxy , which blocks out the uv / optical afterglow . in this case",
    "the distribution of host galaxy @xmath2  may extend much further than that which is observed in our sample .",
    "grbs with no associated optical counterpart are typically referred to as ` dark ' , although the various possible causes for the lack of an optical counterpart make the term ambiguous @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall use the term dark to refer to those grbs that have no afterglow detected at the @xmath30 level above background in any of the uvot filters within one hour of the prompt emission .",
    "there are seven _ swift _  grbs that satisfy both our definition of dark and which have spectroscopically measured redshifts , where @xmath72 . at higher redshifts than this",
    "a grb would always appear dark to uvot due to the redshifting of the lyman break below the uvot energy band . to estimate the amount of dust in the local environment of this sample of grbs",
    ", we initially assume the relation between @xmath18  and @xmath2  to be linear , and thus use the x - ray column density , @xmath18 , of the grb host galaxy to trace the amount of dust - extinction affecting the grb uv / optical afterglow .",
    "we compare this with the dust extinction estimated for a sample of 34 optically bright _ swift _",
    "detected grbs .",
    "this sample is made up of those grbs with an uv / optical afterglow detected by uvot and a corresponding spectroscopic redshift , up until grb  060912 ; this includes our original sample of seven uvot bright grbs listed in table  [ tab : powsedfits ] .",
    "all data were taken from epochs where no spectral evolution is observed , and it was reduced in the same way as described in section  [ subsec : xray ] .",
    "the intrinsic column density was then determined from a single power law fit with two absorbers ; one at @xmath73 with the column density fixed at the galactic value , and a second one at the redshift of the burst with the column density and x - ray spectral slope , @xmath74 , left as free parameters . the resulting distribution in @xmath18  within the two populations of bursts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nhdist ] , where the solid histogram corresponds to the dark bursts , and the uvot bright bursts are represented by the dashed histogram .",
    "fourteen bright grbs had negligible absorption at the host galaxy , represented in the smallest bin of @xmath18 .",
    "the mean logarithm of the x - ray column density , over and above the galactic column is @xmath75  @xmath1  and @xmath76  @xmath1  for the bright and dark population of grbs , respectively , suggesting that dark grbs reside in denser environments .",
    "assuming grb host galaxies to have an @xmath18  and @xmath2  relation similar to that observed in the smc ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : nhavrat1 ] ) , we use the measured @xmath18  to determine @xmath2 . doing this we estimate a mean visual extinction of @xmath77  mags for the dark population of bursts shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : nhdist ] .",
    "the most absorbed grb in the sample of dark grbs was grb  060510b , which had a rest - frame column density @xmath18= @xmath78  @xmath1  and , therefore , an estimated rest - frame visual extinction of @xmath2@xmath79  mags .",
    "however , grb  060510b had an r - band detection of r  @xmath80 at around 12  minutes after the prompt emission , making the inferred extinction rather unrealistic , which suggests that the @xmath18/@xmath2  ratio of @xmath81  @xmath1  is likely too small for the most absorbed of grbs",
    ".    instead , we use the host galaxy gas - to - dust ratios determined in our spectral analysis to acquire a mean value of @xmath18/@xmath2 , where we use the values determined from the smc model .",
    "this corresponds to : @xmath82 using this relation we estimate a range in rest - frame @xmath2  of @xmath83 , with a mean of @xmath84  mags .",
    "the overlap in rest - frame visual extinction in the uvot dark and bright population of grbs suggests that several factors may contribute to the lack of an optical afterglow .",
    "however , the mean value of @xmath84  mags is almost eight times the mean extinction observed in the bright grbs listed in table  [ tab : powsedfits ] , indicating that the local environments of uvot dark grbs are much dustier than those with uvot detected optical counterparts",
    ". this could explain , or at least contribute , to the lack of an afterglow blueward of 5500   .",
    "bin represents those grbs with no measurable x - ray column density above the galactic absorption.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this paper we use the seds of seven optically bright grbs , covering the optical , uv and x - ray energy bands , to determine the amount of dust extinction and soft x - ray absorption present in the local environments of the grb .",
    "we use the milky way ( mw ) and the large and small magellanic cloud ( lmc and smc ) extinction laws to model the host galaxy dust extinction dependence on wavelength .",
    "these show a decreasing prominence in the strength of the 2175    feature , and increasing levels of far - ultraviolet extinction , respectively .",
    "all grbs but one were best - fit by the smc or lmc extinction law , with the smc extinction law typically giving a better fit . only in the case of grb  050802 did a model with a galactic extinction law at the host galaxy provide a better fit , although smc and lmc extinction laws were rejected with only 97% and 90% confidence , respectively .",
    "this , therefore , suggests that small graphite grains responsible for the 2175  feature are not predominant in grb host galaxies .    for six of the seven grbs in our sample",
    "an absorption and extinction system was detected at the redshift of the grb , which must be located at least several parsecs from the source to have survived the intense radiation emitted by the grb .",
    "however , the gas - to - dust ratios measured in the host galaxies of our sample of bursts are lower than previously suggested from analysis of pre-_swift _",
    "grbs , and consistent with those observed in the milky way and magellanic clouds .",
    "there is , therefore no evidence of dust destruction by the grb in its circumburst environment provided by the spectral analysis alone .",
    "however , this does not rule out the destruction and photoionisation of dust and gas within a few parsecs of the grb , which is expected to take place within the first few tens of seconds of the grb prompt emission .",
    "the host galaxy visual extinction observed in our sample ranges from @xmath2  @xmath85 to @xmath4  mags .",
    "however , the requirement that the grbs analysed have a detected optical counterpart introduces selection effects that favour grbs with a low @xmath2 . using the amount of host galaxy @xmath18  as an indicator of the amount of visual extinction undergone in the grb local environment",
    ", we estimate that those grbs with no optical counterpart have , on average , values of @xmath2  almost a factor of eight larger than those observed in the sample of bright grbs studied in this paper .",
    "this would suggest that the host galaxies of dark grbs are intrinsically dustier than those of grbs with uvot detected optical counterparts , which could account for the lack of an optical afterglow .",
