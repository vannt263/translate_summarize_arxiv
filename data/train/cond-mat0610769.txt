    "the phase diagram of ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2  exhibits a rich variety of physical phenomena spanning the unconventional superconductor sr@xmath8ruo@xmath2  to the antiferromagnetic mott - insulator ca@xmath8ruo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the essentially different character of these physical ground states is quite outstanding in view of the fact that only the ionic radius on the ca / sr - site varies throughout this series .",
    "the ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2-phase diagram offers therefore the interesting possibility to tune through a mott - transition by structural changes only .",
    "the smaller ionic radius of divalent ca compared to that of divalent sr induces a series of structural phase transitions characterized by rotations or tilts of the ruo@xmath9-octahedra as it is typically observed in perovskites and related compounds .",
    "such structural deformations have a strong impact on the electronic band structure since they modify the metal - oxygen hopping parameters and thereby the electronic band widths @xcite . in ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2",
    "the decrease of the sr content @xmath10 first stabilizes a rotation of the octahedra around the @xmath11 axis and then , for @xmath12 , a tilting of the octahedra around an in - plane axis @xcite .",
    "further decrease of the sr - content finally leads to the mott - transition associated with another structural transition , across which the ruo@xmath9 octahedra become flattened and their tilting increases @xcite .",
    "remarkable physical properties were reported for the sr - concentration range @xmath13 , i.e. in the metallic phase close to the mott transition @xcite .",
    "approaching the sr content x=0.5 from higher values nakatsuji et al .",
    "report a continuous increase of the low - temperature magnetic susceptibility reaching at x=0.5 a value 200 times larger than that of pure sr@xmath8ruo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the electronic coefficient of the specific heat is exceptionally high , of the order of @xmath14 @xcite , well in the range of typical heavy fermion compounds .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering has revealed strongly enhanced magnetic fluctuations @xcite with a propagation vector of @xmath15@xmath16(0.2,0,0 ) .",
    "the fluctuations in ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2  with @xmath10 close to 0.5 are quite different from those in pure sr@xmath8ruo@xmath2  @xcite : although the magnetic instability observed for @xmath17 is still incommensurate , its character is closer to ferromagnetism .",
    "the magnetic properties of the ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2-compounds with a sr content close to 0.5 show some resemblance to localized electron systems ; it has even been proposed that in these materials an orbital - selective mott - transition occurs leaving a part of the 4d - electrons itinerant @xcite .",
    "this proposal has initiated a strong debate concerning its theoretical basis as well as concerning its applicability to the phase diagram of ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2 .",
    "it appears safe to assume however , that the @xmath18-band  associated with the @xmath19-orbital exhibits a much smaller band width than that of the @xmath20- or @xmath21-band , since the rotation mainly influences the hybridization of the @xmath19-electrons @xcite .    upon further decrease of the sr - content",
    "the tilt transition occurs with an apparently strong impact on the magnetic properties .",
    "the low - temperature magnetic susceptibility rapidly decreases with increasing tilt and the electronic specific - heat coefficient is reduced but remains at a rather high level .",
    "applying a magnetic field to ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  at low temperature induces a metamagnetic transition with a step - like increase of the magnetisation of about 0.4  @xmath22  per ru .",
    "the metamagnetic transition field , @xmath23 sensitively depends on the direction of applied field ; the transition occurs at 5.5  t when the field is applied along the @xmath11-direction @xcite whereas values of 2 and 7  t are found for field directions along the @xmath24-plane @xcite .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the metamagnetic transition field , in particular the difference for the two orthorhombic in - plane directions , suggests the relevance of spin orbit coupling .",
    "the metamagnetic transition in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2strongly resembles that observed in the double - layer ruthenate sr@xmath25ru@xmath8o@xmath26 , which has attracted special interest due to quantum - critical phenomena related with the end - point of the first - order metamagnetic transition@xcite .",
    "apart from the different basic structure , these two- and single - layer ruthenates possess similar structural characteristics , in particular , they both exhibit the structural deformation characterized by octahedra rotation around the @xmath11-axis .    in recent work ,",
    "we have analyzed the structural aspects of the metamagnetism in ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2  by a combination of diffraction , of high - resolution thermal expansion , and of magnetostriction experiments @xcite .",
    "these studies gave evidence of a change of the orbital arrangement driven by either temperature or magnetic field .",
    "the thermal - expansion anomalies observed at zero magnetic field illustrate an increase of the @xmath19  orbital occupation upon cooling , whereas the anomalies at high field point to a decrease of the @xmath19-occupation upon cooling .",
    "accordingly , the structural effects seen as a function of magnetic field at low temperature ( diffraction and magnetostriction results ) show that upon increasing magnetic field electrons are transferred from the @xmath27- and @xmath28-orbitals into the @xmath19-orbital . in this work",
    "we have completed these studies for ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2  with @xmath29 and @xmath17 by additional diffraction studies and by high - resolution dilatometer measurements along different direction in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields .",
    "in addition we have focused on the metamagnetic transition itself by collecting more data close to the critical field and by extending the measurements towards lower temperatures for ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  where the metamagnetic transition is best defined .",
    "single crystals of ca@xmath6sr@xmath30ruo@xmath2 were grown by a floating - zone technique in image furnaces at kyoto university @xmath31 and at universit paris sud @xmath32 .",
    "details of the preparation process are reported in reference  @xcite .",
    "in addition , powder samples of ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 and ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2  were prepared following the standard solid - state reaction .",
    "the samples were from the same batches as those studied in refs .",
    "@xcite or characterized by x - ray diffraction and susceptibility to possess identical properties .",
    "thermal expansion and magnetostriction were studied in magnetic fields up to 14 t in two different home - built capacitive dilatometers down to a lowest temperature of 300mk @xcite .",
    "the magnetization measurements were performed using a quantum design vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) . with the gem diffractometer at the isis facility ,",
    "neutron powder diffraction patterns were recorded as a function of temperature and in fields up to 10 t for ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "x - ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded between 10 and 1000k using a d5000 siemens diffractometer and cu - k@xmath33-radiation .",
    "among the ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2  series the metamagnetic transition is best defined in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , therefore , we have chosen this composition for the most detailed thermodynamic studies .",
    "figure 1 presents the results of diffraction experiments on a powder sample to characterize the structural evolution as function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "these data were taken with the gem diffractometer using a magnetic - field cryostat .",
    "in addition , the right panels of figure 1 show the lattice parameters determined by x - ray diffraction in a wider temperature interval . ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2exhibits two distinct structural distortions at low temperatures , the rotation of the ruo@xmath9-octahedrons around the c - axis and the tilting . above @xmath16350  k ,",
    "we find only the rotational distortion in space group @xmath34 with a lattice of @xmath35 with respect to the ideal tetragonal lattice .",
    "a characteristic feature of this phase observed in many ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2-compounds @xcite concerns the negative thermal expansion along the c - axis which persists over a broad temperature range , see the x - ray data in fig .",
    "1 . the structural phase transition associated with the octahedra tilting further reduces the symmetry towards @xmath36 with the nearly same lattice parameters as in @xmath34 .",
    "although the @xmath36 space group has also been reported for the insulating and metallic phases observed for @xmath37 , see reference @xcite , the symmetries are different , since in the case of the low - temperature phase for @xmath38 the rotational distortion still leads to a doubling of the @xmath11-axis .",
    "high - resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along and perpendicular to the @xmath11-axis reveal strong low - temperature anomalies @xcite , which are also visible in the diffraction data . both in - plane parameters expand upon cooling whereas the c - axis shrinks , see figure 1 .",
    "the diffraction data further show that upon increase of the magnetic field both in - plane directions shorten while @xmath11 elongates . with the full structure analysis",
    "one may attribute this effect essentially to a change in the octahedron shape , which becomes elongated at high field indicating a shift of orbital occupation from @xmath19  to @xmath27  and @xmath28  states @xcite .",
    "a set of powder - diffraction patterns were recorded on gem using a zero - field cryostat in order to better characterize the temperature dependence of the crystal structure in a wider range . up to a temperature of 160",
    "k the essential structural change arises from a weak variation of the tilt distortion . at low temperature",
    "the tilt angle saturates at values of 5.9 and 4.4 degrees determined at the basal ( o1 ) and apical oxygen ( o2 ) , respectively .",
    "the minor differences in these two tilt angles indicate that the ruo@xmath9-octahedrons are not perfect in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "the tilt distortion is coupled to the orthorhombic strain @xmath39 which at first sight is counterintuitive , as the tilt occurs around the @xmath40-axis which is the shorter one .",
    "similar to other k@xmath8nif@xmath2 materials with a tilt distortion , the interactions in the ca / sr - o rock - salt layer induce an elongation of the lattice and of the ruo@xmath9-octahedron perpendicular to the tilt axis . although this octahedral distortion might be relevant in splitting the @xmath27  and @xmath28-@xmath5-levels and hence cause the in - plane anisotropy of the metamagnetic transition field , it is not related to an orbital ordering effect .",
    "the orthorhombic splitting , as well as the difference in the o1-o1-edge lengths of the octahedrons , are clearly coupled to the tilt angles , see fig . 1 and 2 .",
    "the low - temperature anomalies seen in the thermal expansion @xcite are clearly visible in the lattice parameters , but the effect in the internal crystal structure is within the error of this measurement , see fig .",
    "2 .    figure 3 shows the magnetostriction data recorded along the c - axis for field directions parallel and perpendicular to @xmath11 .",
    "qualitatively , both orientations show the same effect ,  the elongation of the lattice when passing the metamagnetic transition at @xmath41=5.7  t for the field applied along @xmath11 and at 2.0  t for the field perpendicular to @xmath11 , see also reference @xcite . at fields well above the metamagnetic transition",
    ", there is little quantitative difference between the two field directions : the elongation is only 20% smaller when the field is applied parallel to @xmath11 .",
    "the comparable structural effects along both directions imply that the magnetostriction of ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  does not simply arise from the alignment of anisotropic ionic coordinations as it is the case in rare - earth compounds .",
    "instead it has to be attributed to a transition or at least to a cross - over between distinct phases .",
    "spin - orbit coupling seems to cause the sizeable anisotropy of the metamagnetic transition field , but it seems not to play a major role in the metamagnetic transition itself .",
    "the magnetostriction data and their field derivative show that the transition becomes smeared out with increasing temperatures .",
    "the maxima of the derivatives shift towards higher fields with increasing temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the height of the peak in the magnetostriction rapidly decreases with increasing temperature for both field directions ; roughly @xmath42 scales with @xmath43 , see figure 2e ) and f ) .    at the lowest temperature of 0.3  k , the magnetostriction along both field directions was measured upon increasing and decreasing field .",
    "there is no hysteresis discernible , which is surprising in view of the expected first - order character of the metamagnetic transition .",
    "furthermore , even at the lowest temperature studied , the transition appears quite broad , in particular when compared to the metamagnetic transition in sr@xmath25ru@xmath8o@xmath26 , which consists of three contributions each of them possessing a width of the order of a tenth of a tesla @xcite .",
    "we can not exclude that similar features are hidden in the broader peak in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  but one may note that the symmetry in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  is orthorhombic already at zero field . in ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2",
    "the mixed occupation of ca and sr with distinct ionic radii induces strong intrinsic disorder with local variations of the tilt and rotation angles together with the concomitant local variation of the electronic structure .",
    "evidence for local disorder in the ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2-series has recently been found in arpes and stm studies @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic disorder most likely is responsible for the broadening of the transition and it may further suppress any hysteresis . keeping the strong microscopic disorder in mind",
    "it appears very difficult to determine the thermodynamic critical end - point in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  or even to discuss its existence at finite temperatures .",
    "figure 4 shows the results of the thermal - expansion measurements taken along the @xmath11-direction with the field parallel to @xmath11 ( longitudinal configuration ) .",
    "both the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath44 and the length change @xmath45 are shown in the upper panels .",
    "one immediately recognizes that the strong thermal expansion anomaly occurring around 20  k changes its sign upon increase of the magnetic field in accordance with the idea that all these effects are due to the orbital rearrangement @xcite . here , we want to discuss whether the effects across the metamagnetic transition in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  can be related with the accumulation of entropy expected at the thermodynamic end - point . for sr@xmath25ru@xmath8o@xmath26",
    "it is argued that quantum criticality plays a dominant role in spite of the first - order character of the metamagnetic transition , since the end - point of the metamagnetic transition would be sufficiently low in temperature @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to look for signatures of a quantum - critical end - point in the thermodynamic properties of ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  motivating us to extend the previous data @xcite to lower temperatures . in the inset of the upper - left panel of figure 4",
    "we show the thermal expansion coefficient for magnetic fields close to the low - temperature metamagnetic transition .",
    "the anomalous effects seem to be essentially suppressed when approaching the transition field .",
    "this effect is also seen when plotting the ratio of the thermal expansion coefficient over temperature @xmath46 , see the lower panels of figure 4 . upon increase of the magnetic field",
    "@xmath46 first increases to exhibit maxima slightly below the metamagnetic transition , see figure 5 . at the transition it changes its sign and upon further field increase",
    "there is a minimum slightly above the transition .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath46 is roughly symmetric in @xmath47 and the distance of the two extrema is in agreement with the width of the transition seen in the low - temperature magnetostriction .",
    "dividing the @xmath46 values by the analogous @xmath48 values one may determine the grneisen - parameter .",
    "the field dependence of the @xmath49-ratio was reported in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "upon increasing the magnetic field at low temperature , @xmath49 increases only by about 20% up to a maximum at the metamagnetic transition and then drops rapidly above the transition .",
    "consequently , the grneisen - parameter does not diverge when approaching @xmath23 in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .    from inelastic neutron scattering",
    ", it is known that ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2exhibits at least two magnetic instabilities @xcite related with strongly enhanced magnetic fluctuations .",
    "an incommensurate antoferromagnetic contribution arising from fermi - surface effects appears to compete with a quasi - ferromagnetic instability .",
    "the latter can be directly deduced from the temperature dependence of the macroscopic susceptibility @xcite . for compositions close to ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2",
    "a ferromagnetic cluster glass has even been reported @xcite . at intermediate temperatures",
    "the macroscopic susceptibility for @xmath29 exceeds that of ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2  but it exhibits a maximum at around 10  k and is much smaller than that for @xmath17 at low temperature .",
    "compared to a curie - weiss extrapolation the susceptibility for @xmath29 is significantly reduced at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the incipient ferromagnetic instability occurring in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  as well as in ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2seems to get efficiently blocked through the structural anomaly flattening the ruo@xmath9-octahedron at low temperatures .",
    "this effect may reduce the amplitude of the associated fluctuations and enhance their characteristic energy . through the transfer of electrons into the @xmath18-band ,",
    "the ferromagnetic instability is weakened possibly due to a shift of the van - hove singularity . at higher fields ,",
    "the compound is forced into a ferromagnetic ordering and , therefore , quasi - ferromagnetic fluctuations are weakened by further stabilizing this ferromagnetic ordering explaining the reversed structural anomalies occurring upon cooling for fields above @xmath23",
    ". the sign change of the thermal - expansion anomaly just at the transition field , its large amplitude and its nearly symmetric behavior around the transition field imply that the metamagnetic transition is related with strong fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the critical end - point of the metamagnetic transition in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  although hidden by the intrinsic disorder of the system must be close within the relevant energy scales .",
    "garst and rosch @xcite and gegenwart et al .",
    "@xcite have made quantitative predictions for a metamagnetic transition related with a quantum - critical end - point which were already tested for the sr@xmath25ru@xmath8o@xmath26-compound .",
    "first @xmath50 should vary as @xmath51 at both sides of the transition .",
    "the ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2-data shown in fig .",
    "5 clearly deviate from such a behavior , in particular there is no divergence in the experimental data .",
    "close to the transition the microscopic disorder may superpose positive and negative thermal expansion anomalies cancelling each other .",
    "the almost complete suppression of the anomaly close to the metamagnetic transition field is only possible if the intrinsic @xmath52 dependence is fully antisymmetric giving further weight to our interpretation that the strongest fluctuations appear just at the metamagnetic transition and that the critical end - point must be quite close .",
    "these theories furthermore correctly predict that the thermal expansion anomalies increase in temperature with increasing @xmath53 .",
    "however , the scaling laws proposed for the thermal expansion do not agree perfectly with our data @xcite . again the intrinsic disorder might change the temperature dependencies quite drastically .",
    "in addition the strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations which are well established in ca@xmath6sr@xmath7ruo@xmath2  will also interfere with the thermodynamic parameters .",
    "concerning the crystal structure , ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2  differs from the ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2-compound by the absence of the long - range tilt distortion .",
    "this is visible in the @xmath11-axis thermal - expansion coefficient which is negative over a wide temperature interval , see figure 1 . due to the larger and positive thermal - expansion coefficient in the @xmath24 plane",
    "the volume thermal expansion however is positive also for @xmath17 . taking into account the different thermal expansion behavior at intermediate temperatures , the low - temperature @xmath11-axis anomalies are qualitatively similar in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  and in ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2 , compare figures 6 and 4 .",
    "this suggests that a metamagnetic transition also occurs in ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2 .",
    "however , all structural anomalies are significantly smaller for @xmath17 .",
    "the field - dependent thermal expansion for @xmath17 was measured in the four configurations with field and length change either parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath11-axis .",
    "again the difference in the longitudinal and transverse configurations arise mainly from a shift in the transition fields which is much smaller for fields oriented perpendicular to the @xmath11-axis .",
    "in addition to the results discussed for @xmath29 , these ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2-data show that the in - plane lattice parameters anomalously increase upon cooling in zero field and become shorter in high fields .",
    "the magnetostriction data shown in the lowest panels of figure 6 confirm the opposite signs of the field - induced length changes parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath11-axis .",
    "the volume magnetostriction is about an order of magnitude smaller than the uniaxial components confirming our interpretation that these effects arise from an orbital rearrangement between the @xmath5-orbitals @xcite .",
    "the strong reduction of the magnetostriction and of the thermal expansion anomalies for @xmath17 must be related with the absence of the long - range tilt deformation .",
    "either the lattice in the crystal structure with a simple rotational distortion is much harder thereby reducing the structural response , or there is a direct interplay between the tilt and electronic parameters .",
    "one may expect the tilt deformation to act more strongly on the @xmath27  and @xmath28  orbitals in contrast to the octahedron rotation which interferes mostly with the @xmath19  orbitals @xcite .",
    "figure 7 compares the magnetization and the field - induced length change along the @xmath11-direction and their derivatives versus magnetic field . in the magnetization hysteresis cycles we find a remanent magnetization of a few thousands of a @xmath22  for fields along and perpendicular to the @xmath11-direction in agreement with the cluster - glass behavior reported in reference @xcite .",
    "the underlying short - range ferromagnetic ordering seems to be another consequence of the intrinsic disorder implied by the ca / sr mixing .",
    "even though the remanent magnetization is extremely small the underlying ferromagnetic ordering has a strong impact on the magnetization curves , in particular for the field within the planes . at low field",
    "the magnetization sharply increases hiding any metamagnetic transition at higher field .",
    "the magnetization data shown in figure 7 do not yield direct evidence for the metamagnetic transition .",
    "furthermore , the steep low - field increase of the magnetization is not accompanied by the magnetostriction in contrast to the close coupling between these entities in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "the low - field increase of the magnetization seems to fully arise from the short - range ferromagnetic correlations ; this feature is not related with the metamagnetic transition and there is no comparable feature observed for @xmath29 . however , the field derivative of the magnetization for ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2  shown in the lower - right panel of figure 7 clearly exhibits two features : in addition to the finite low - field value there is a clear shoulder at higher fields resembling the peak at the metamagnetic transition in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "this second feature corresponds to the maximum in the magnetostriction ( upper right panel ) .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that a metamagnetic transition in ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2  still occurs , although the associated jump in the magnetization is strongly reduced compared to that in the ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "detailed studies of the structural properties in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  and in ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2  by diffraction and by dilatometer methods allow us to clarify the microscopic and the thermodynamic aspects of the metamagnetic transition in these materials .",
    "a temperature and magnetic - field driven redistribution of the orbital occupation seems to be responsible for the anomalous structural effects . upon cooling in zero field @xmath54-electrons",
    "seem to move into the @xmath19  orbitals causing a suppression of a quasi - ferromagnetic instability .",
    "this effect is reversed either by cooling at high magnetic field or by applying a magnetic field at low temperature . the structural difference between ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  and ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2",
    "consists in the long - range tilt deformation which is found to strongly enhance the structural as well as the magnetic anomalies . even though the magnetization data in ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2  do not exhibit the well - defined metamagnetic transition ,",
    "the field derivative of the magnetization as well as the magnetostriction clearly show that a qualitatively similar metamagnetic transition also occurs in ca@xmath3sr@xmath4ruo@xmath2 .",
    "however , this material already exhibits short - range ferromagnetic ordering at low temperature and zero magnetic field which partially hides the metamagnetic transition . the identical ferromagnetic instability is also present in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  at intermediate temperature ,",
    "but here it is fully suppressed at low temperature due to the octahedron tilting .    by analyzing the thermal expansion anomalies close to the metamagnetic transition in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , we present evidence that the related critical end - point must be close to the low - temperature transition in the relevant scales . in particular , we find that the @xmath50-coefficient is nearly symmetric across the transition field .",
    "the more precise scaling predictions for the thermal expansion coefficient across a metamagnetic transition are , however , not fulfilled in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 . in this material intrinsic disorder as well as the competition of different magnetic instabilities",
    "appear to play an important role .",
    "we wish to dedicate this manuscript to professor hilbert von lhneysen on the occasion of his 60th birthday .",
