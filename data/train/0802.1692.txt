    "for masses smaller than @xmath4 , uncertainties in the pre@xmath0main - sequence ( pms ) evolutionary tracks are sufficiently great that the usual method of estimating the mass and age of a young star , by its location in the h - r diagram , can produce a scatter as large as a factor of 2 in mass and 3 in age depending on the tracks used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the mass spectrum of stars produced in a star - forming region , the distribution of masses in binaries , and the region s star - forming history are imprecisely known .",
    "measuring reliable masses , luminosities , and effective temperatures of young stars contributes empirical data for testing calculations of young star evolution . currently , there are few pms stars with reliably measured masses ; in particular , there are none below 0.4  @xmath5 with a precision better than 10% @xcite .    mapping the orbital motion of a binary system provides a way to measure the dynamical masses of pms stars .",
    "observations of a system as both a visual and spectroscopic binary yield the component stellar masses as well as the distance to the system .",
    "spectroscopic radial velocity measurements of pms binaries are typically limited to systems which have periods smaller than a few years . at the distance of nearby star forming regions like taurus and ophiuchus , this range of orbital periods corresponds to angular separations smaller than a few tens of milli - arcseconds ( mas ) . as a result , there are few pms spectroscopic binaries that can be resolved spatially using the current generation of high resolution instrumentation . @xcite applied this approach to the pms binary ntts 045251 + 3016 by combining single- and double - lined radial velocity measurements with spatially resolved observations obtained with the fine guidance sensors on the _ hubble space telescope_. @xcite used the keck interferometer and published spectroscopic observations to determine the masses of the pms binary hd 98800b .",
    "precise mass measurements of even a few systems provide critical data for calibrating the evolutionary tracks .",
    "additionally , the distances determined from the joint orbital solutions provide an accurate location of the system within the relatively spread - out star forming regions .",

    "we used the keck interferometer in its @xmath8 science mode , operating in the k - band .",
    "we observed haro 1 - 14c on five nights between june 2004 and may 2007 . to calibrate the fringe visibilities , we interspersed observations of unresolved single stars between those of haro 1 - 14c",

    "the angular diameters were calculated using the fbol routine in the getcal package which fits a blackbody model to spectrophotometric data .",
    "input to the routine included b and v magnitudes from the all - sky compiled catalog of 2.5 million stars ( kharchenko 2001 ) , j , h , k band magnitudes from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) catalog ( cutri et al . 2003 ) , and parallaxes from the hipparcos catalog ( perryman et al .",
    "the last three calibrators listed in table  [ tab.cal ] were observed as part of other programs but were used in this paper to improve the time sampling of calibrators surrounding the haro 1 - 14c observations .",

    "the last 2 lines refer to the new observations made after the publication of sp04 .    to measure the spectral types and velocities of the components we analyzed all the spectra , including the spectra used in sp04 , as follows .",

    "hr 8085 , a k5  v , and gl 15a , a m1.5  v , both rotationally broadened to 12 km s@xmath22 , provided the best matches for the primary and secondary of haro 1 - 14c , consistent with the result reported in sp04 .",
    "we chose not to use the observed stellar templates to measure the component velocities , as we had in sp04 , because to do so would have propagated velocity uncertainties associated with the templates to haro 1 - 14c .",
    "instead , we used a suite of theoretical spectra calculated from updates of the nextgen models @xcite .",
    "these calculations represent main sequence stars with solar abundance in the mass range 0.1 to 1.6 @xmath23 .",
    "we selected theoretical spectra that provided excellent matches to the observed spectra of hr 8085 and gl 15a .",
    "we then used these two corresponding spectra , with a velocity correction to the heliocentric frame appropriate for each target observation , to measure the radial velocities of the primary and secondary components of haro 1 - 14c .",
    "we applied wilson s ( 1941 ) approach to our 8 pairs of primary and secondary velocities to determine the center - of - mass velocity and its uncertainty , @xmath24 km s@xmath22 .",
    "this value of @xmath25 and the component velocities we measured from the infrared spectra are in the laboratory frame of the theoretical spectra , which is not necessarily the frame in which @xcite measured the velocity of the haro 1 - 14c primary .",
    "their 56 measurements yield a very accurate value of the center - of - mass velocity of @xmath26 km s@xmath22 .",

    "these values , and their propagated uncertainties , are reported in table 3 .",
    "the velocity uncertainties of the secondary , which are particularly important in the determination of the secondary / primary mass ratio , are about half the values reported in sp04 .",
    "velocity measurements of a double - lined spectroscopic binary yield the orbital period , eccentricity , time of periastron passage , longitude of periastron , and the velocity semi - amplitudes of the primary and secondary ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ) . a visual binary yields @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where the last three parameters are the semi - major axis in arcseconds , the inclination , and the position angle of the line of nodes . combining the visual and spectroscopic orbital parameters",

    "the distance to the binary is determined by comparing the angular size of the visual orbit with the physical scale of the spectroscopic orbit , @xmath41 where the distance @xmath42 is in pc .",
    "we performed a simultaneous orbit fit to the interferometer visibilities and spectroscopic radial velocities presented in this paper and in @xcite .",
    "the orbit fitting procedure starts with initial estimates of the orbital parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath43 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath25 ) and the k - band flux ratio and follows a newton - raphson approach to adjust these parameters to their best - fit values . during each iteration of the routine ,",
    "the values of ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) are computed at the times of the interferometer observations from the given set of orbital parameters .",

    "the epochs of the keck interferometer observations are marked along the orbit .",
    "the radial velocity measurements and best - fit velocity curves are shown in figure  [ fig.sb2 ] .    the spectroscopic orbital parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath25 ) of haro 1 - 14c are well - determined by the single- and double - lined radial velocities . however , the limited sampling of the visual orbit provided by the keck interferometer observations produces a large uncertainty in the inclination .",
    "we examined the distributions of @xmath43 and @xmath35 allowed by the current set of @xmath8 measurements by performing a two - dimensional monte carlo search . during each iteration of the search , we selected values of @xmath43 and @xmath35 at random and minimized the remaining orbital parameters through the standard newton - raphson approach .",
    "we accumulated a total of 10,000 possible solutions within the 3-@xmath52 confidence interval ( @xmath53 from the minimum @xmath49 value ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath49 distribution is shown in figure  [ fig.chi_ai ] .",
    "the long tail of solutions that extends to small inclinations produces extremely large component masses when combined with the spectroscopic parameters .",
    "the uncertainties for @xmath43 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath42 quoted in table  [ tab.orbpar ] represent the bounds of the 1-@xmath52 ( @xmath54 ) confidence regions .",
    "the results from the monte carlo search also allow us to examine the uncertainties in the binary separation derived from the epochs of the keck interferometer observations .",
    "for each of the 10,000 orbital solutions found , we computed the binary separations at the times of the interferometer observations and overplotted the 1-@xmath52 confidence intervals in the orbit plot in figure  [ fig.orb ] . the elongated error ellipses arise from the limited @xmath16-coverage sampled during the interferometer observations ( see figure  [ fig.uv ] ) . given the low altitude of haro 1 - 14c at the latitude of the keck observatory , the short 1 - 3 hour observing sessions do not provide much rotation of the projected interferometer baseline on the sky .",
    "essentially , the narrowness of the error ellipses shows the exceptional resolution along the direction of the interferometer baseline .",
    "because we fit all of the visibilities from each epoch simultaneously with the spectroscopic radial velocities , additional measurements with the keck interferometer at different locations along the orbit will help reduce the range of allowed orbital solutions and hence reduce the size of the error ellipses in the binary separation for every epoch ( see   [ sect.sim ] for more details ) .",
    "to investigate the distribution of masses and distance allowed by the interferometric and spectroscopic data , we performed a more exhaustive 6-dimensional monte carlo search .",
    "we randomly selected values for all of the orbital parameters on which the masses and distance depend ( @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath43 , @xmath35 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ) while minimizing the fit to the remaining parameters through the standard newton - raphson approach . we accumulated a total of 10,000 possible solutions within the @xmath53 confidence interval .",
    "the top row of figure  [ fig.mass ] shows cross - cuts through the @xmath49 surface for the component masses and distance versus the inclination . following the approach outlined in @xcite",
    ", we constructed histograms of the allowed masses and distance where each solution is weighted by its @xmath49 probability .",
    "as seen in these histograms , shown in the bottom row of figure  [ fig.mass ] , the mass and distance distributions are strongly peaked .",
    "we present the median values of these distributions in table  [ tab.mass ] .",
    "the range of the quoted uncertainties include 34% of the values on each side of the median .",
    "in computing these values , we applied an arbitrary upper mass cut - off of 2.0  @xmath5 for the primary , since masses larger than this value are clearly not representative of the spectral type and stellar luminosity of haro 1 - 14c .",
    "compared to the formal @xmath49 intervals in table  [ tab.orbpar ] , the statistical analysis substantially reduces the size of the error bars .",
    "it is worth noting that because of the sharp drop in the mass distributions on the low - mass sides , improved mass values are not likely to be much smaller than the present values , but may be larger . in the following sections we refer to the median masses and distance estimates given in table  [ tab.mass ] , as we believe these values more accurately represent the asymmetric parameter distributions .",
    "obtaining interferometric observations that are well distributed across the orbit is critical for determining a reliable measurement of the inclination .",
    "since the inclination is determined from the offset of the primary star from the focal point of the apparent orbit , measuring an accurate value requires good orbital sampling along both the major and minor axes of the apparent ellipse . for the orbit of haro 1 - 14c",
    ", we have fairly good coverage along the major axis of the ellipse , but we have only one marginal measurement along the direction of the minor axis . during the observations on 2005 april 20 , we experienced unusually low instrument throughput on haro 1 - 14c which made it difficult to lock onto the fringes and consequently degraded the quality of the @xmath8 measurements . because these marginal measurements sample a critical location along the orbit , a precise value of the inclination has not yet been determined .    to investigate what we can expect from future observations with the keck interferometer",
    ", we simulated @xmath8 measurements for 2008 june 1 and 2012 may 1 .",
    "these dates were selected to provide good sampling of the haro 1 - 14c orbit at times when the binary is observable with the keck interferometer . to simulate the interferometer measurements , we computed the expected @xmath8 based on the predicted binary position at 20 minute intervals over 2.3 hours centered on transit .",
    "we added gaussian noise to the simulated @xmath8 and recomputed the simultaneous orbit fit based on the measured and simulated @xmath8 and spectroscopic radial velocities .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig.sim ] , the additional measurements would significantly reduce the uncertainties in the orbit fit",
    ". moreover , the simulated data yield formal @xmath49 uncertainties in the masses and distance that are smaller by more than a factor of 2 compared with the current values in table  [ tab.orbpar ] .",
    "the orbital measurements yield a dynamical estimate of the distance to haro 1 - 14c of @xmath55 pc .",
    "this result is consistent with the close distance estimates of the ophiuchus dark clouds ( @xmath56  pc ) determined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite find a similar mean distance of @xmath57  pc to the ophiuchus core using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) to measure the parallaxes of radio - emitting pms stars .",
    "the distance of @xmath58  116 pc determined from the formal orbital parameters ( table  [ tab.orbpar ] ) is slightly closer to the vlba value than our statistical estimate , although both are in agreement within the 1-@xmath52 uncertainties .",
    "ultimately , accurate distances that map the spatial extent of the ophiuchus clouds will be necessary for determining the luminosities , and hence ages , of young stars in the region .",
    "in addition to the distance estimate , the interferometric measurements yield the flux ratio of the components in the k - band . because we have insufficient information to determine the luminosities , in   [ sect.tracks ] we compare our results with the theoretical pms evolutionary tracks using h - r diagrams plotting the absolute magnitude at k , @xmath59 , versus the effective temperature , @xmath60 .",
    "the primary and secondary absolute magnitudes are given by @xmath61 where @xmath42 is the distance in pc , @xmath3  pc , and a@xmath62 the extinction at k. to calculate the extinction at v we use @xmath63 derived by @xcite from the reddening relations used by @xcite .",
    "then , with @xmath64 for @xmath65 m @xcite , @xmath66 .    the apparent magnitudes of the haro 1 - 14c binary available in the 2mass catalog at j , h , and k are @xmath67 and @xmath68 mag , respectively . with the measured binary flux ratio at k ( table 4 ) , the apparent magnitudes of the primary and secondary are @xmath69 and @xmath70 mag . using the 2mass values ( which apply to the light of both components ) in equation  [ eq.ak ] , we obtain a preliminary estimate of @xmath71 mag .",
    "we used the pms models calculated by siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to estimate the effect of the two components and derive a corrected visual extinction of @xmath72 mag . using the relation @xmath66",
    ", we find @xmath73 mag .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the primary and secondary are therefore @xmath74 and @xmath75 mag .",
    "the uncertainties include only the errors in the measured k - band flux ratio and the 2mass photometry but not the uncertainties in either the distance modulus or extinction because their values apply equally to both components .",
    "we will display the effects of the uncertainties in the distance modulus and extinction on the h - r diagrams presented in  [ sect.tracks ] .    based on the observed spectral templates , the best fitting spectral types for the primary and secondary of haro 1 - 14c are k5 and m1.5 , respectively . to estimate the effective temperatures of the primary and secondary",
    ", we used the temperature scale adopted by @xcite and derive values of @xmath76 k for the primary and @xmath77 k for the secondary .",
    "we assume uncertainties of @xmath78  1 spectral subclass .",
    "the dynamical masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in the range where precise values will make a significant contribution to testing the theoretical tracks of pre - main sequence stellar evolution .",
    "this is particularly the case for the low mass secondary .",
    "moreover , the large difference in the mass of the primary and secondary will facilitate applying the coevality test to the tracks and estimating the age of the system . based on our statistical analysis of possible orbits ,",
    "the precision of the present values of the primary and secondary masses is about 28% and the precision in the distance is 17% . in the following sections we compare our mass estimates with the evolutionary tracks of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2002 ; bcah ) and siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ; sdf ) .",
    "the evolutionary tracks are plotted in figure  [ fig.tracks ] , where we highlight the tracks interpolated to our dynamical mass estimates of the primary and secondary of haro 1 - 14c .",
    "we overplotted the location of the effective temperatures and absolute k - band magnitudes determined for the primary and secondary (  [ sect.mkteff ] ) .",
    "we discuss the comparisons between each set of models in more detail below .",
    "the sdf tracks are available at subsolar , solar , and supersolar metallicities ( z=0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , respectively ) .",
    "we retrieved the absolute k - band magnitudes from the sdf database that were computed using the temperature scale of @xcite .",
    "the tracks suggest that the haro 1 - 14c binary is 3 - 4 myr old .",
    "arguably , our measurements fit the tracks for each of the three abundances within the uncertainties , but with a slight preference for the solar or supersolar tracks .",
    "the bcah tracks are available for solar and subsolar ( [ m / h]=-0.5 ) metallicities . for masses below 0.7  @xmath5",
    ", we used the tracks calculated with a mixing length parameter of 1.0 ; for greater masses we used the tracks with a mixing length of 1.9 .",
    "the solar and subsolar tracks indicate an age for the binary of @xmath58  3  myr , or slightly older .",
    "agreement with the mass and coevality appears to be slightly better on the subsolar tracks .      across the range of metallicities",
    "considered , both the tracks of bcah and sdf indicate an age of 3 - 4 myr for the haro 1 - 14c binary . sliding the components up and down according to the distance and extinction uncertainties in the h - r diagrams would change the binary age but",
    "not the qualitative agreement with the tracks .",
    "overall , the agreement between the evolutionary tracks and our measurements seems to be better for the models of sdf than for bcah , especially when considering the coevality criterion .",
    "the evolutionary tracks of sdf and bcah allow for the possibility of solar , supersolar , and subsolar metallicities for haro 1 - 14c .",
    "however , based on a comparison with the solar metallicity spectral template , hr 8085 , we argue that a subsolar or supersolar metallicity for haro 1 - 14c is unlikely given the strength of the fe lines across order 49 of the nirspec spectrum ( see figure  [ fig.spec ] ) . additionally , @xcite find a metallicity that is indistinguishable from solar for the ophiuchus star - forming region .",
    "our age estimate of 3 - 4 myr for haro 1 - 14c is slightly older than the median age of 2.1 myr determined by @xcite for the @xmath79  ophiuchus molecular cloud .",
    "however , @xcite use a distance of 150  pc in determining the stellar luminosities in their sample .",
    "if a large portion of the stars in ophiuchus are located at the closer distance estimate of 120  pc , the net effect would be to decrease the intrinsic luminosities and increase the age estimate of stars in the region .    from our preliminary analysis",
    ", it appears that a major limiting factor in making comparisons with the pms evolutionary tracks lies in our ability to estimate the effective temperatures of the component stars .",
    "based on the spectral types of the best - fitting observed spectral templates , we used the temperature scale adopted by @xcite to estimate @xmath60 for the components of haro 1 - 14c .",
    "temperatures of pms stars determined in this way are not only affected by the @xmath78  1 spectral subclass uncertainties from the fit , but are also subject to differences in the adopted temperature scale .",
    "for instance , the temperature scales used by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite vary by more than 200  k for stars of spectral type m2 and later .",
    "possible improvements in the @xmath60 measurements of pms stars could be obtained from fitting synthetic spectral templates to high resolution near - infrared spectra @xcite , however , this may prove difficult for binaries where the spectra of the rotationally broadened components are blended .",
    "\\1 . using the keck interferometer , we spatially resolved the orbit of the pre - main sequence binary , haro 1 - 14c .",
    "we also added two new spectroscopic measurements of the radial velocities of the primary and secondary .",
    "we computed a simultaneous orbit fit to the interferometer visibilities and the spectroscopic radial velocities .",
    "based on a statistical analysis of the orbital parameters that fit the data , we determined component masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the secondary in haro 1 - 14c is one of the lowest mass pms stars with a dynamical measurement of its mass .",
    "additional interferometric observations of haro 1 - 14c at well - chosen times during the orbit will substantially improve the estimate of the orbital inclination . not only will this provide precise values for the dynamical masses of the components , but it will also improve the distance measurement for the system .",
    "an accurate distance is needed to derive the luminosities and place the stars on the h - r diagram .",
    "the remaining issue that needs to be addressed in comparing dynamical mass measurements with theoretical evolutionary tracks lies in determining accurate effective temperatures for pms binaries .",
