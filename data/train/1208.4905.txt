    "an universal feature that underlies in these systems over various levels is the polymer flexibility that can adapt to ambient thermal noises as well as the external forces .",
    "another one is the aqueous background which transmits hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) . in this vein , we pose a fundamental question : how the nature allows the confined ( stretched ) biopolymer systems to utilize the ambient thermal fluctuations and the system flexibility for maximum cooperativity to an external signal in such an overdamping media ?    the stochastic resonance ( sr ) is a noise - induced phenomenon , where the background noise can enhance coherence and resonance of a non - linear system to a small additive periodic signal @xcite .",

    "this entropic sr suggests novel possibilities for manipulating the dynamics of single biopolymer transitions utilizing their flexibility .    to address the sr of biopolymers in constrained situations mentioned earlier , in this work we study the dynamics of an end - tethered worm - like chain ( wlc ) subject to a constant tension and an additional small oscillating force . the end - to - end distance ( extension ) of the chain",
    "is indeed found to respond most coherently at an optimal noise - strength , and , at optimal length for the case of the polyelectrolyte under an electric field .",
    "it turns out that the most pronounced sr is due to the longest - wave length lateral undulation of the chain in response to the oscillation .",

    "<S> within the cell , biopolymers are often situated in constrained , fluid environments , e.g. , cytoskeletal networks , stretched dnas in chromatin . </S>",
    "<S> it is of paramount importance to understand quantitatively how they , utilizing their flexibility , optimally respond to a minute signal , which is , in general , temporally fluctuating far away from equilibrium . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we analytically study viscoelastic response and associated stochastic resonance ( sr ) in a stretched single semi - flexible chain to an oscillatory force or electric field . including hydrodynamic interactions between chain segments , we evaluate dynamics of the polymer extension in coherent response to the force or field . </S>",
    "<S> we find power amplification factor of the response at a noise - strength ( temperature ) can attain the maximum that grows as the chain length increases , indicative of an entropic stochastic resonance ( esr ) . in particular for a charged chain under an electric field , we find that the maximum also occurs at an optimal chain length , a new feature of esr . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic interaction is found to enhance the power amplification , representing unique polymer cooperativity which the fluid background imparts despite its overdamping nature . for the slow oscillatory force , </S>",
    "<S> the resonance behavior is explained by the chain undulation of the longest wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> this novel esr phenomenon suggests how a biopolymer self - organizes in an overdamping environment , utilizing its flexibility and thermal fluctuations . </S>"
