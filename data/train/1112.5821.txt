    "follow - up deeper 50  ks observation remarkably increased the number of detected sources : @xmath9 sources in almost the same filed ( @xcite , but2006 hereafter ) .",
    "xmm - newton also detected many point sources in the wider fov ( @xmath2 ) . by subtracting the contribution of detected point sources",
    ", @xcite indicates a hint of diffuse emission extending about the size of tev emission region .",

    "the detection of a diffuse x - ray emission for the 50  ks chandra data has been also reported by @xcite with the same analysis technique .",

    "in such a case , x - ray emission can be much lower than leptonic case , and a typical strength of magnetic field of pwne , 3  @xmath6 g , could be acceptable .",
