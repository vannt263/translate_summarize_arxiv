    "turbulent convection is omnipresent in the atmosphere of the earth@xcite and other planets.@xcite in many cases the convective motion is accompanied by phase changes .",
    "when warm air parcels rise they cool down and can form a condensate or in other words  a cloud .",
    "moist convection combines thus turbulent motion of characteristic plumes as known from the classical dry convection with phase transitions between vapor and liquid water ( or even ice as a third phase ) .",
    "the dynamics of clouds contains a wide range of spatial and temporal scales starting from cloud microphysical processes on millimeter scales within seconds up to the dynamics of whole clouds or even cloud clusters on scales larger than kilometers with lifetimes of an hour or more.@xcite on all scales turbulence interacts with the cloud dynamics and the phase changes in multiple ways which are not yet fully understood , but have to be parametrized in global models of atmospheric motion.@xcite progress can be achieved in two ways .",
    "either one increases the number of physical processes and thus the complexity of the parametrizations as necessary in large - eddy simulations ( les ) or cloud - resolving models to meet the variety of cloud phenomena @xcite or one tries to reduce the dynamics to a few essential building blocks and disentangles their complex interplay .",
    "the latter route is taken in the present work .    in this paper",
    ", we study therefore moist rayleigh - bnard convection ( mrbc ) with simplified thermodynamics of the phase changes .",
    "the model equations will make use of the boussinesq approximation which means that variations of thermodynamic state variables about their reference profiles remain small .",
    "the model describes thus aspects of shallow moist convection as present in low cumulus @xcite and stratocumulus clouds.@xcite oceanic and continental surfaces at the bottom of the troposphere have different thermal properties and can act differently on the turbulent convection .",
    "this in turn can directly affect the cloud formation as pointed out e.g. by bretherton.@xcite convection over land surfaces supplies usually very heterogenous surface conditions , such as different degrees of roughness or moisture fluxes due to changes in vegetation .",
    "such effects were studied in les by a reduction of complex surface conditions to a strip - like heterogeneity with a prescribed variation scale.@xcite it was shown that the resulting buoyancy fluxes depend sensitively on the heterogeneity scale due to partly initiated secondary convective circulations close to the boundary . in the simplest case ,",
    "boundary conditions ( bc ) for the temperature and moisture can be prescribed by constant values , constant fluxes or mixtures of both .",
    "in particular , constant amplitude boundary conditions can be considered as a first approximation of moist convection over an ocean surface with a constant sea surface temperature , constant flux boundary conditions as a first approximation for a shelf region close to the coast line .",
    "the present work will study the impact of such simple boundary conditions on the buoyancy flux and the cloud formation by means of three - dimensional direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .",
    "how do the differences in the turbulent transport for both bc depend on the rayleigh number ?",
    "the atmospheric context as a motivation in mind , we will carry out the dns in flat cells with an aspect ratio of 16 and larger .",
    "our mrbc model is a direct extension of the classical dry rayleigh - bnard convection incorporating the physics of phase changes in a simplified way , but keeping the main ingredient , the release of latent heat ( for more details , see sec .",
    "ii and ref . ) .",
    "this simplification makes the present model accessible to parametric dns studies without subgrid - scale parametrizations of turbulence . in a series of dns studies with our mrbc model , which used so far the constant value bc",
    "only , we demonstrated that some aspects of the complex atmospheric cloud dynamics can be reproduced qualitatively well by the present model.@xcite this holds particularly for the so - called _ conditionally unstable _ regime of moist convection , in which dry unsaturated air is stably and moist saturated air unstably stratified with respect to small vertical lifts of the air parcels.@xcite moist convection is known to form then localized cloud aggregates in which the moist air rises up and is surrounded by ambient unsaturated regions with a significantly reduced level of turbulent fluctuations.@xcite similar to wall - bounded shear flows , conditionally unstable moist convection is triggered by a finite - amplitude perturbation of the ( linearly stable ) equilibrium.@xcite this is a situation that can exist when cumulus clouds are formed.@xcite    interestingly in classical dry rayleigh - bnard convection the case of fixed temperatures at the plates is mostly investigated.@xcite only in the last years fixed flux bc or combinations of fixed value and fixed flux bc came into the focus of interest in order to understand differences in simulations and experiments . emphasis was given to the dependence of the global turbulent heat transport as quantified by the nusselt number @xmath3 on the rayleigh number @xmath4 , one input parameter of convection.@xcite otero et al.@xcite and later wittenberg@xcite derived an analytical upper bound on the turbulent heat transport for the case of fixed flux and no - slip boundary conditions for the flow that has the same dependence on the rayleigh number as the fixed temperature case , that is @xmath5 .",
    "it is known that constant flux bc decrease the critical rayleigh number @xmath6 for the onset of convection and shift instabilities to the largest scales.@xcite the critical wavenumber is thus zero in an infinitely extended layer .",
    "this also holds for stress - free or free - slip bc of the velocity field .",
    "it is different to the fixed - temperature case where the critical wavenumber is of the order of one .",
    "thus for rayleigh numbers right above the linear instability threshold a box of arbitrary length will contain a single convection roll only and we can expect that relics of this property are observable in the turbulent regime .    the impact of fixed flux bc on turbulent heat transport in rayleigh - bnard convection is still a matter of ongoing research . in ref .",
    ", dns with fixed heat flux bc at the lower heating plate and fixed temperature at the upper cooling plate of a cylindrical cell were performed .",
    "it was found that for rayleigh numbers larger than @xmath7 the nusselt number @xmath3 is larger than for the case of both plates being held at constant temperature .",
    "differences in the evolution of the rising thermal plumes at the lower plate were suggested as a reason for such an increase .",
    "later it was shown that for higher resolutions the plume detachment does not depend on the particular choice of temperature boundary conditions.@xcite a further series of dns was done by johnston and doering.@xcite the authors compared both sets of bc within two - dimensional simulations of rayleigh - bnard convection with periodic side walls over a large range of rayleigh numbers .",
    "their work was focussed on the turbulent heat transport and its dependence on the aspect ratio of the domain .",
    "the main result was that for rayleigh numbers increasing beyond @xmath8 the nusselt number of the fixed flux case converges to that of fixed temperature case and eventually coincides for @xmath9 .",

    "it is based on works of kuo @xcite and bretherton @xcite who studied the effect of latent heat release and phase changes on the structure and organization of moist convection at small rayleigh numbers .",
    "a detailed derivation of our model can be found in ref . .",
    "the model combines the classical dry rayleigh - bnard convection with condensation and evaporation of water .",
    "the main assumptions of the model are as follows .",
    "we consider conversions between water vapor and liquid water only and exclude the third phase of ice .",
    "the air parcels are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium , i.e. , the vapor content @xmath10 and the liquid water content @xmath11 can be summed up to the total water content @xmath12 .",
    "the present model incorporates the boussinesq approximation which limits it to convection in shallow layers .",
    "it is also used that in the vicinity of the phase boundary the buoyancy @xmath13 of an air parcel at a height @xmath14 can be expressed as a _ linear _ combination of the two thermodynamic state variables , the entropy ( or potential temperature ) @xmath15 and the total water content @xmath12 .",
    "this step preserves the discontinuity of partial derivatives of @xmath16 at the phase boundary which are given by @xmath17 and thus the release of latent heat .",
    "note that the constants differ , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "since the thermodynamic quantities are linearized on both sides of the phase boundary they can be combined to two new prognostic state variables , a _ dry _ buoyancy field @xmath20 and a _ moist _ buoyancy field @xmath21 , @xmath22 the dry buoyancy @xmath23 can be interpreted to be proportional to the so - called liquid water potential temperature and the moist buoyancy @xmath24 to be proportional to the equivalent potential temperature .",

    "the second parameter determines how much liquid water can be formed in the convection layer when an air parcel that is saturated at @xmath61 rises adiabatically to the top .",
    "they are given by @xmath62 note that the ( linear ) equations for the dry and moist buoyancy fields are not independent.@xcite if we define a scalar @xmath63 then we can derive from ( [ gg3 ] ) and ( [ gg4 ] ) an advection - diffusion equation for a conserved scalar @xmath64 which is given by @xmath65 it follows that if @xmath66 and @xmath67 have different initial conditions they will tend to become equal . here",

    "convective motion can be triggered out of an equilibrium state in which no fluid motion is present . in our moist convection model",

    "( [ equid ] ) and ( [ equim ] ) it follows then that @xmath80 and @xmath81 and thus @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "one can then distinguish two classes of conditionally unstable equilibrium states ( see also the saturation condition eq .",
    "( [ buoorig ] ) ) :    1 .",
    "equilibrium which is fully unsaturated or fully saturated .",
    "this can be achieved , e.g. , if @xmath84 and thus @xmath85 .",
    "equilibrium which is partly saturated and partly unsaturated .",
    "the threshold between both determines an _ equilibrium cloud base _ which is given by the condition @xmath86 it follows if @xmath87 and thus @xmath88 .",
    "more detailed , for the first class c1 one can distinguish thus 3 cases :    1 .   fully unsaturated equilibrium with @xmath89 over the whole layer .",
    "kuo - bretherton case with @xmath90 which is neither saturated nor unsaturated over the whole layer.@xcite 3 .   fully saturated equilibrium with @xmath91 over the whole layer .",
    "as it turns out in the next subsection , the comparison of both sets of boundary conditions translates to compare moist convection that evolved from different initial conditionally unstable equilibrium states .",
    "it is now discussed how the simulations with the two sets of boundary conditions have to be compared .",
    "two strategies are possible , either to run simulations with the same buoyancy fluxes or with the same mean buoyancy values at the planes . here",
    "the second option was chosen .",
    "the first strategy turned out to be less feasible due to the transitional properties of the present model.@xcite the reference point will be thus always the run with @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding run with @xmath74 results from the moist turbulence conditions as they evolve in the former .",
    "the comparison is as follows .",
    "first , we define a kuo - bretherton - type equilibrium state which is case c1b as seen in fig . [ equi](a ) .",
    "the equilibrium state is given by the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is neither subsaturated nor supersaturated .",
    "then we perturb the equilibrium and initiate convective turbulence for the @xmath75 case which will evolve into a statistically stationary state .",
    "second , the mean buoyancy profiles for @xmath23 and @xmath24 are calculated .",
    "we denote averages over horizontal planes and time by @xmath94 ( see fig . [",

    "note that a similar translation is necessary in dry rayleigh - bnard convection.@xcite at the top plate the resulting mean temperature in the fixed flux case is then smaller than the original temperature of the equilibrium state , at the bottom plate it is higher than the original one .",
    "the same is observed in fig .",

    "the quiescent layer is held therefore exactly at the saturation threshold .",

    "in order to compare both types of runs we rescale the data from the @xmath74 case with the characteristic scales of the @xmath75 case .",

    "the buoyancies for both runs are expressed in the same dimensionless units . in this study",
    "we want to investigate trends for growing rayleigh numbers .",
    "an increase in the rayleigh numbers can be performed in two ways : the first way is that we increase the difference @xmath104 and leave @xmath50 and @xmath51 unchanged .",
    "the second way is to obtain growing rayleigh numbers through a decrease of @xmath50 and @xmath51 such that the prandtl number remains unchanged .",

    "are observable as our analysis of vertical mean profiles of buoyancies , velocity fluctuations and buoyancy transport currents shows .",
    "differences in the velocity and buoyancy fields occur due to the fact that in the case of neumann bc the scalar fields can vary at the plates .",
    "with increasing rayleigh number these differences decrease such that at @xmath174 statistical properties are nearly the same .",
    "a comment on the velocity boundary conditions is in order here : many of the cited references use no - slip bc for the velocity field instead of free - slip bc .",

    "the qualitative picture remained unchanged .",

    "a further aspect was that we wanted to compare our studies with the previous work on this subject such as those by kuo@xcite and bretherton.@xcite in terms of a more realistic configuration with respect to the atmospheric dynamics mixed bc ( no - slip at the bottom and free - slip at the top ) would be a possible case which is an interesting aspect of future work .",
    "for the present parameter settings , the convection layer can be divided into two subregions . in the upper part of the convection layer",
    "a closed cloud layer is found in which the saturated air parcels are in turbulent motion .",
    "the lower part consists of a layer of unsaturated air which is mostly stably stratified and inhibits significant convective motion as indicated by a significant reduction of the turbulent velocity fluctuations and the convective buoyancy transport . in this layer diffusive transport of moisture and heat dominates .",
    "since the mean diffusive equilibria are the same for both sets of boundary conditions similar mean profiles result particularly for the higher rayleigh numbers .",
    "our dns indicate that with increasing rayleigh number the vertical transport across the full layer is more and more diminished .",
    "one reason for this behavior is that the diffusive transport in general gets less and less efficient to sustain fluid motion in the dry part . in a nutshell , the convection in both subsystems decouples increasingly of each other . in the upper subsystem",
    ", we observe classical rayleigh - bnard convection of fully saturated air , in the lower part weak fluid motion in a stably stratified environment .",

    "[ bild6 ] .",
    "one resulting question is which additional physical processes can re - amplify the vertical transport across the whole layer and break up this separation between the sublayers ?",
    "a suggestion is to add radiative transfer or precipitation processes .",
    "although the qualitative behavior of moist turbulent convection in the conditionally unstable regime differs significantly from the classical dry convection case , one main outcome of the study in the present mrbc model is very similar to what has been found in dry rayleigh - bnard convection . with increasing rayleigh number",
    "the global transport properties for runs with both sets of boundary conditions converge to each other .",
    "this finding seems to be also robust when switching from the two - dimensional case as in ref . to three dimensions as here .",
    "although the structures of the turbulence fields in the three - dimensional case are much more complex some basic mechanisms of the upward transport of heat ( and moisture ) are similar .",
    "the properties which are relevant for atmospheric processes such as the cloud fraction or the vertical transport of heat and moisture were not affected by the particular choice of the bc in our mrbc model for the highest accessible rayleigh number . as mentioned already above , interesting would be therefore to repeat such study with further physical processes included , such as the radiative transfer and precipitation in order to test if this insensitivity persists .",
