    "the dense knots that populate the closest bright planetary nebula ngc 7293 ( the helix nebula ) must play an important role in mass loss from highly evolved intermediate mass stars and therefore in the nature of enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) by these stars .",
    "it is likely that similar dense condensations are ubiquitous among the planetary nebulae ( odell et  al .",
    "2002 ) as the closest five planetary nebulae show similar or related structures .",

    "therefore , these condensations contain a significant fraction to a majority of all the material ejected .",
    "it is an extremely important point to understand if the ism is being seeded by these knots and if they survive long enough to be important in the general properties of the ism and also the process of formation of new stars . to understand those late phases ,",
    "long after the knots have escaped the ionizing environment of their central stars , one must understand their characteristics soon after their formation - which is the subject of this study .",

    "the three dimensional model for the helix nebula has also evolved during this time .",
    "we now know that the inner part of the nebula is a thick disk of 500  diameter seen at an angle of about 23  from the plane of the sky ( odell et  al .",
    "2004 , henceforth omm04 ) .",
    "this disk has a central core of high ionization material traced by he  ii emission ( 4686  ) , and a series of progressively lower ionization zones until its ionization front is reached .",
    "the more easily visible lower ionization portions of the inner - disk form the inner - ring of the nebula .",
    "there are polar plumes of material perpendicular to this inner disk extending out to at least 940  ( omm04 ) to both the northwest and southeast .",

    "( 2005 , henceforth m05 ) argue is a thin layer of material on the surface of the perpendicular plumes , whereas omm04 ) and odell ( 2005 ) argue that this is due to a larger ring lying almost perpendicular to the inner disk .    the nature of the knots has attracted considerable attention .",
    "odell &  burkert ( 1997 ) determined the properties using hst wfpc2 emission line images in h@xmath8 , [ n  ii ] , and [ o  iii ] , while odell et  al .",
    "( 2000 , henceforth ohb00 ) analyzed hst slitless spectra of the bright knot 378 - 801 in h@xmath8  and [ n  ii ] , an investigation extended in a study ( odell et  al , henceforth ohf05 ) with better slitless images in the same lines and also the [ o  i ] line at 6300  .",

    "( 2001 ) have shown that the early apparent discrepancy between the observed and predicted surface brightness of the bright cusps is resolved once one considers the dynamic nature of the flow from the cusp ionization front , which depresses the recombination emission from the ionized gas .",

    "the h@xmath1  emission is produced in a thin layer of material immediately behind the ionized cusp ( huggins et  al .",
    "ohb00 show that the optical structure within the ionized cusp can only be explained if the material is heated on a timescale that is longer than the time for cool material to flow from the ionization front across the width of the cusp .",
    "this slow heating rate means that forbidden lines are seen only further away from the ionization front ( because these require energetic electrons to cause their collisional excitation ) whereas recombination lines like h@xmath8  arise preferentially from the cool regions closer to the ionization front .",
    "a succession of papers ( burkert &  odell 1998 ; ohb00 , ohf05 ) attempting to simultaneously account for both the ionization and flow of material have produced a general model where cool material in the molecular central core flows towards the ionization front , is slowly heated , and upon passing through the ionization front is more rapidly heated and accelerated . at first examination the most recent models look satisfactory .",
    "however , the models fail because the theoretically expected zone of 900 k gas has much too low a column density to account for the observed surface brightness in h@xmath1  ( ohf05 ) .",
    "these h@xmath1  observations must be telling us about something overlooked in previous models . as we discuss in   4.4 , this missing ingredient seems to be that the earlier models were for a static structure , whereas the knots are actually in a state of active flow .",
    "this paper reports on work intended to clarify the nature of the knots in the helix nebula .",

    "a new and more refined theoretical model is presented in   4 , while these and other recent observations and models are discussed in   5 .",
    "in this investigation we draw on both our own new observations made with the hst and published observations made with a variety of telescopes .",
    "these observations range from the optical through the infrared .",
    "the new hst observations were made during eight orbits over the period 2006 may 22 - 24 as program go 10628 ( co - author odell as principlal investigator ) .",
    "the helix nebula is sufficiently large that we could simultaneously observe it with the three operating imaging instruments , the wfpc2 ( holtzman et al . 1995 ) , the nicmos ( thompson et al . 1998 ) , and the acs ( gonzaga , s. et al . 2005 ) . by careful selection of the pointing and orientation of the spacecraft , we were able to sample three regions that are useful for understanding the knots and their structure . in each case",
    "the new observations are either unique or of substantially longer exposure time than previous similar observations .",
    "the placement of the fields of view are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the nicmos observations were made with the nic3 camera ( 256x256 pixels , each about 0.2/pixel ) , with eight exposures in both the f212n ( isolating the 2.12 @xmath0 m h@xmath1  line and the underlying continuum ) and the f215n ( isolating primarily the underlying continuum as there are no strong lines in this region ) filters .",
    "each of the sixteen exposures was 1280 s duration .",
    "the pointing was changed in a four position pattern , with steps of 5 .",
    "the on - the - fly standard processing image products were our starting point .",
    "these images were combined using iraf and tasks from the hst data processing stsdas package provided by the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) .",
    "the method of calibration used in ohf05 was adopted , where the nebular and instrumental continuum was subtracted using the signal from the f215n filter .",
    "the resultant image is shown in figure 2 along with aligned wfpc2 optical emission line images from programs go 5086 and 5311 .",
    "the knot 378 - 801 is located in the low central region of each image and details of its bright cusp and tail are analyzed in   3.1 and   3.2 .",
    "it is notable that all of the h@xmath1  cusps have corresponding h@xmath8  and [ n  ii ] counterparts and that all of the h@xmath8  and [ n  ii ] cusps have h@xmath1  counterparts on these well exposed , high resolution images .",
    "a field to the southsoutheast of the central star and falling into the outer - ring portion of the helix nebula was imaged with the acs camera .",
    "eight exposures of nominally 1200 s each were made in both the f658n filter ( which passes the h@xmath8  and [ n  ii ] 6583   lines equally well ) and the f502n filter ( dominated by the [ o  iii ] 5007   line ) .",
    "the field of view shown in figure 1 overlaps only slightly with the acs mosaic built up during the go 9700 survey with the same filter pairs ( omm04 ) . the signal to noise ratio was much higher than in the go 9700 survey since that study used total exposures of about 850 s in both of filters .",
    "the images in the four offset pointings were combined using tasks within the stsdas package .",
    "no attempt at absolute calibration was made because of the f658n filter requiring additional observations with the f660n filter , which is dominated by [ n  ii ] ( odell 2004 ) . the resulting image for f658n",
    "is shown in figure 3 .",
    "originally of 0.05  pixels , it has been averaged into 2x2 samples in order to increase the signal to noise ratio . since the finest features are larger than the size of the resultant pixels ( 0.1 ) no loss of detail was incurred .",
    "the f502n image is much lower signal and is not presented here , although portions of it are reproduced and discussed in   3.4 .",
    "sixteen exposures of 1100 s each were made with the wfpc2 f469n filter that isolates the he  ii recombination line at 4686  .",
    "the images from the four pointings were combined using the stsdas package of _ dither _ tasks and the results are shown in figure 4 . for comparison ,",
    "a matching section of the acs mosaic that was derived as part of program go 9700 ( omm04 ) is also shown .",
    "there are three recent papers that contain observations pertinent to our discussion of the nature of the knots in the helix nebula .",
    "these include two space infrared observations and one groundbased study .      in a recent paper h06",
    "present the results of an extensive observational study of the helix nebula .",
    "they have imaged the object out to the northeast - arc ( omm04 ) with the irac camera ( fazio et  al .",
    "2004 ) in four broad filters centered on 3.6 @xmath0 m , 4.5 @xmath0 m , 5.8 @xmath0 m , and 8.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "these filters are dominated by emission from rovibrational lines within the @xmath14 ground electronic state , although an atomic continnum must be present in addition to a few collisionally excited forbidden and recombination emission lines .",
    "the resolution of these images is about 2 , so that one can not resolve structure within the cusps , but one can see structure along radial lines passing through the bright cusps and their much longer tails .",
    "spectra were obtained with the irs ( houck et  al .",
    "2004 ) at three positions , two falling in the outer - ring at locations north and southwest of the central star and the third location ( used for background subtraction ) falling directly on the fainter northeast - arc feature .",
    "they present calibrated fluxes for rovibrational lines of h@xmath1  from 0 - 0 s(7 ) at 5.51 @xmath0 m out to 0 - 0 s(1 ) at 17.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "they also present a groundbased image in a filter centered on the 2.12 @xmath0 m  h@xmath1  line which is of comparable spatial resolution but wider field of view that the speck et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) study .",
    "this image is not flux calibrated but appears to go fainter than the speck et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) image .      in the program go 9700 study that produced a continuous mosaic of acs images mx05 also obtained parallel nic3 images in the f212n filter at six science positions and one sky position .",
    "each position was actually a double exposure of two pointings , which allowed a slight overlap of the nic3 fields .",
    "the total exposure at each position was about 750 s and double that in the regions of overlap .",
    "the method of calibration was different as only f212n images were obtained ( the few f175w images were not useful for calibration of the f212n images ) . it was assumed that the sky images included all the background signal that need to be subtracted , which means that it did not subtract nebular continuum .",
    "the nic3 images are under - sampled ( the pixel size of 0.2  is about the same as the telescope s resolution at this wavelength ) as in our new observations of the field around 378 - 801 . when comparing the data , one should note that the maximum effective exposure time is about 1500 s for the go 9700 f212n images , while in our study it is 10,240 s. as discussed in   3.4 , our acs field overlaps with much of the mx05 position 2 field , allowing a more meaningful comparison of optical and infrared images of this region than was possible in the mx05 study .",
    "these new images of the helix nebula with three different hst cameras provide new information on a number of subjects related to the nature and formation of the knots .",
    "the nicmos h@xmath1  image allows a discussion of the cusp and tail structure , the he  ii image places constraints on the location of the knots to the southwest , and the acs images allow a more complete comparison of early h@xmath1 images to the south and southeast with comparable resolution optical emission line images .",
    "the new nic3 h@xmath1  2.12 @xmath0 m  line observations were scaled to the same pixel size as the wfpc2 ( 0.0996/pixel ) using bilinear interpolation and carefully aligned .",
    "although this region has been imaged numerous times in this line , this is clearly the best image in terms of both its resolution and signal .",
    "the three primary optical line images and the new h@xmath1  image are shown in figure 2 . in order to make a quantitative analysis ,",
    "the images were rotated and a sample three pixels wide along the axis of the cusp - core - tail was made .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 , where the peak value of the h@xmath1  2.12 @xmath0 m  and [ nii ] emission is normalized to unity as are the outer portions of the [ oiii ] profiles .    2.12 @xmath0 m infrared line .",
    "the 2.12 @xmath0 m  image has lower resolution ( about two pixels ) and a comparison of the appearance in the different lines is discussed in the text . ]",
    "the optical line results are similar to those found by odell & burkert ( 1997 ) , burkert &  odell ( 1998 ) , odell , henney , &  burkert ( 2000 ) and ohf05 in that the ionization occurring furthest from the knots ionization front ( [ o  iii ] ) is weak and extended , this intrinsic low brightness allows one to see the core of the knot in silhouette against the background nebular emission in this line .",
    "although the extinction peaks in the core of the knot , it extends to about 5  from the bright cusp .",
    "the [ n  ii ] emission is strong and displaced ( 0.05 ) away from the ionization front with respect to the h@xmath8  emission .",
    "one sees extinction in h@xmath8  from the core out to almost the same distance as in [ o  iii ] .",
    "the lack of apparent extinction in [ n  ii ] must be due to there being relatively more emission in that line in the sheath of ionized gas surrounding the shadow of the knot .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the h@xmath8  and the [ n  ii ] images are 0.48  and since the fwhm of the stars in the field of view is 0.25 , quadratic subtraction of this instrumental component leaves an intrinsic line width in those emission lines of 0.41 .",
    "the fwhm of the h@xmath1  line is 0.61  and the nearby star s is 0.42 , leaving an intrinsic fwhm for h@xmath1  of 0.44  with a peak displaced 0.11  towards the core of the knot from the h@xmath8  peak .",
    "the fwhm corresponds to a length of @xmath16 cm and the displacement to @xmath17 cm .",
    "the ionized line characteristics are similiar to those found in the previous studies , but we have added here the important characteristic of the small but certain displacement of the broader h@xmath1 .",
    "the earlier h@xmath1studies lacked the resolution to determine this characteristic , or in the case of mx05 , lacked the high resolution optical lines necessary for the comparison .",
    "the calibrated peak surface brightness in the cusp of 378 - 801 is @xmath18 @xmath19  in the h@xmath1  2.12 @xmath0 m  line .",
    "this agrees well with the peak value of @xmath20 @xmath19  found by huggins et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , where they used the calibration of speck et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and utilized a spatial resolution that would not have recognized the narrowness of the peak .      the well defined tail in 378 - 801 is primarily formed by a shadow in the ionizing lyman continuum ( lyc ) radiation cast by the optically thick core , with illumination occurring by diffuse ( recombination ) lyc photons and direct radiation grazing the edge of the core .",
    "the first order theory describing this situation was presented by cant et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and applied to the tails of the helix nebula and the shadows behind the orion nebula proplyds soon after ( odell 2000 ) . ohf05 discussed the structure in tail of 378 - 801 within the light of this theory and its next order refinements ( wood et  al .",
    "2004 ) , but were unable to explain the details of what was being seen .",
    "h@xmath1  in the tails was first detected by walsh &  ageorges ( 2003 ) and we are able to establish with our new observations where this emission arises .    we present in figure 6 results from traces across the tail of 378 - 801 extending from 3.1   to 6.0  behind the peak of the cusp in h@xmath8 .",
    "this region does not extend as far as the partially obscured knot lying on the east side of the tail with its cusp 8.3  beyond 378 - 801 s h@xmath8  cusp .",
    "one sees that there is a well defined signature of a limb brightened sheath in both h@xmath1  2.12 @xmath0 m  and h@xmath8 , with the peaks of the h@xmath1  emission occuring inside the h@xmath8 , as expected if the h@xmath8  is associated with a local ionization front .",
    "since the gas ionized by diffuse radiation should be much cooler than the directly illuminated nebular gas , the h@xmath8  emissivity would be high and the ionized sheath is well defined .",
    "these observations establish that conditions in the tail do allow an ionization front to form , while cant et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and odell ( 2000 ) had expected that the shadowed region may be fully ionized .",
    "it is not surprising that no [ o  iii ] emission is seen , rather , that the dust in the tail , concentrated to the middle of the tail ( as noted by ohf05 ) , causes extinction of the background nebular light .",
    "the apparent quandary , noted in ohf05 , is that the [ n  ii ] emission appears to come from inside the ionized sheath of the tail .",
    "we already noted that the h@xmath8  and h@xmath1  structure indicates that an ionization boundary occurs at the edge of the radiation shadow , so there is an apparent contradiction in finding ionized nitrogen emission originating inside an ionization front .",
    "this contradiction is removed by comparison of the [ n  ii ] emission and the optical depth , as determined by the [ o  iii ] image .",
    "figure 7 shows a comparison of the dust optical depth and the [ n  ii ] intensity .",
    "the similarity of the distribution of the optical depth and the [ n  ii ] brightness argues that the [ n  ii ] is actually nebular or cusp light scattered by the only marginally optically thick ( peak value @xmath21=0.2 column of dust ) .",
    "this feature is easy to see because the expected low electron temperature of the sheath s ionization front would suppress the collisionally excited [ n  ii ] .",
    "if our intepretation of [ n  ii ] is correct , then there should be a similar component of scattered h@xmath8  radiation .",
    "this may be what somewhat fills - in the region between the two limb - brightened components ( in addition to the low level of surface brightness expected when examining a thin shell ) . in the cusp [ n  ii ] is stronger than h@xmath8  emission whereas in this part of the nebula the opposite is true .",
    "this point argues that much of the scattered [ n  ii ] emission arises from the nearby bright cusp , rather than the surrounding nebula .",
    "the similar distribution of each argues that the [ n  ii ] emission is caused by scattering of nebular [ n  ii ] emission , as discussed in the text . ]",
    "the distribution along the tail core is discussed in detail in ohf05 ( their   4.1.2 ) and only a few comments need be added .",
    "the question is complex because the knots seem to originate near the nebular ionization front , then are shaped by the radiation field as the ionization front expands beyond them ( odell et  al .",
    "this means that material in the shadowed region will have never seen direct ionizing radiation and could represent pre - knot material from the planetary nebula s photon dominated region ( pdr )",
    ". the other source of tail material could be neutral gas accelerated outwards by the rocket effect ( e.g. mellema et  al . 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the high velocity resolution study of co by huggins et  al . (",
    "2002 ) does not really illuminate the question .",
    "their angular resolution was a gaussian beam of @xmath22 , with the long axis aligned almost along the axis of the tail of 378 - 801 .",
    "since there was a strong co component coming from the partially shadowed knot lying 8.3  beyond 378 - 801 s h@xmath8  bright cusp , this means that there is a not a clear resolution of the co emission from the core of 378 - 801 and the partially shadowed knot . as a result , one can not hope to interpret the small differences in the position of the peak emission at different velocities as core - tail differences .",
    "this could be done with higher spatial resolution co observations .",
    "figure 4 shows our deep heii images alongside the same field covered at comparable resolution with the acs in h@xmath8+[n  ii ]  and [ o  iii ] .",
    "a detailed comparison of the two images indicates that there is no case of a heii feature corresponding to a h@xmath8+[n  ii ]  or [ o  iii ] feature , nor any heii only features .",
    "the part of the wfpc2 field closest to the central star is 144  distance .",
    "the profile of the heii core of the central disk , to which the knots in this part of the nebula belong ( omm04 ) derived from a wide field of view heii image ( odell 1998 ) shows that the core is down almost to 50%  of its peak emission at this distance . if any knots actually occur within the nebula s heii core , we would expect that in the simplest knot models , we would see a heii cusp outside the [ o  iii ] zone of each knot and this is not the case .",
    "however , the basic model is not that simple .",
    "the detailed models of ohb00 and ohf05 show that the normal progression of ionization states in the cusp are preserved , that is , closest to the ionization front there is an he@xmath23+h@xmath24 zone , outside of which there is a he@xmath25+h@xmath24 zone , and outside of that a he@xmath26+h@xmath24 . in a nearly constant electron temperature",
    "nebula the innermost zone is best traced by the [ n  ii ] emission , the next zone by the [ o  iii ] emission , and the outermost zone by the heii emission .",
    "things are not so simple in the case of the knots . as the gas flows through the cusp",
    "it is heated only slowly , so that the collisionally excited [ n  ii ] emission peaks further out , where the gas is hotter , more than making up for the lower fraction of n@xmath27 ions . by the time that the second zone is reached",
    "the density has dropped significantly and the [ o  iii ] emission is broad and weak .",
    "one would expect to find a heii zone associated with a knot only if the knot lies within the nebula s heii core",
    ". this heii zone would be quite weak because the density of the knot s gas would have been greatly decreased this far out .",
    "moreover , the gas has probably nearly reached the temperature of the nebula and these higher temperatures suppress the emission of this recombination line .",
    "this means that it will be hard to actually detect by their heii emission any knots within the heii core of the nebula .",
    "probably the strongest evidence that no knots exist in the heii core lies in the fact that we do nt see any objects in extinction in any of the observed emission lines .      as noted in   2.1.2 ,",
    "our acs field overlapped with one of the double - pointings made with nic3 in f212n as part of program go 9700 ( mx05 ) .",
    "mx05 compared their f212n images with the corresponding five fields in omm04 , where the resolution was about 1and groundbased images were used because the hst acs mosaic did not extend out this far .",
    "this factor of five difference in resolution made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about differences and similarities of appearance .",
    "they did , however , conclude that even their short ( 750 s ) overlapping double exposures were sufficient to establish that the knot cusps were more visible in h@xmath1 . in ",

    "the most refined model is that of ohf05 , which included both the effects of the radiation field and also the hydrodynamic expansion of the knot s ionization front .",
    "it is probably accurate to say that the photoionized portions of the knots are now adequately understood , or at least that the models are broadly consistent with the best observations .",
    "the structure in the tails is only beginning to be understood . to the first order , the tails are the effects of radiation shadows in the dominant ionizing species , the lyc photons ( cant et  al .",
    "1998 , odell 2000 ) .",
    "with this paper (   3.2 ) we have now determined that the well observed tails are ionization bounded , with h@xmath1  sheaths inside the zone of ionized gas that occurs at the edge of the lyc shadow .",
    "the inner part of the tail is dense enough in dust to scatter surrounding nebular light , although the origin of this material as arising from the original process that forms the knots or as material that is moving back from the knot remains uncertain .",
    "the greatest quandary surrounds the explanation of the h@xmath1  zone that is observed immediately inside the ionized cusps of the knots .",
    "the approximate location of this zone of observed h@xmath1  is qualitatively where one would expect it . for reasons given below ,",
    "it is almost certainly not excited by shocks .",
    "other models ( e.g. natta &  hollenbach 1998 ) argue that the heating is by absorption of soft x - rays and others that the excitation mechanism is probably fluorescence , where non - ionizing photons from the stellar continuum excite molecules to the b  @xmath37 and c  @xmath38 electronic states , which then decay , producing the populations of the ground electronic state that give rise to the observed infrared lines . within the core of the knot the density is sufficiently high and the temperature sufficiently low that multiple heavier molecules are formed and the observed co is simply the most easily observed abundant tracer of these heavy molecules .",
    "an alternative method of exciting the h@xmath1  molecules is by shocks . at first",
    "this idea seems attractive because planetary nebulae as a class are known to possess high velocity stellar winds and large scale mass flows with sufficient energy to excite the low lying energy states of h@xmath1  that give rise to the observed infrared lines .",
    "cox98 first pointed out that the lack of a stellar wind ( cerruti - sola &  perinotto 1985 ) rules out excitation by wind - driven shocks . a more complete assessment of shocks as the exciting source was given in ohf05 ( their   4.3.2 ) , where it is shown that although h@xmath1  is heated sufficiently immediately behind a transient shock this shock would quickly move through the knot and up the tail .",
    "the well defined location of the h@xmath1  emission zones immediately behind the ionized cusps and the ionized sheath of the tail strongly argues that we are dealing with a quasi - stationary process , rather than something quite dynamic , like shocks .",
    "h06 base their interpretation of h@xmath1  emission on the assumption of shock excitation .",
    "their assumption is based on the weakness of the h@xmath1  1 - 1 s(7 ) line , stating that the radiative models they use predict strong emission in that line , which they do not observe in their spectra .",
    "the shortcomings of that criterion for determining that the excitation comes from shocks , rather than radiative processes is discussed below in   4.1 . as we show in   4.2 ,",
    "the h06 spectra also argue for a high excitation temperature , as found by cox98 .",
    "the h06 shock interpretation of the relative population distribution of the h@xmath1  energy states used six free parameters as it required three different shock velocities , each with a different relative intensity .",
    "this means that one ca nt use the population distribution to confirm that method of excitation .    a key element of understanding the h@xmath1  emission is the excitation temperature of the gas .",
    "cox98 used spectra of the h@xmath1  0 - 0 s(2 ) to s(7 ) lines to derive the population of their upper states and found that their two sampled regions matched an excitation temperature of 900@xmath3650 k. we show below (   4.2 ) that the new spectra of h06 of the h@xmath1  0 - 0 s(1 ) to s(7 ) lines in two additional regions agree with the results of cox98 and support the idea that the h@xmath1  emission comes from gas that is much hotter than the 50 k conditions expected ( ohf05 ) in the core of the knots .    ohf05 demonstrated that even their most detailed pdr models could not explain the high surface brightness in h@xmath1   of the knot cusps , an argument first made by cox98 from more general considerations .",
    "the argument reduces to the fact that the observed surface brightness in h@xmath1  2.12 @xmath0 m  radiation is too high to be explained by the column density of 900 k h@xmath1  that is predicted .",

    "several papers , including the recent mx05 study , have reported that the surface brightnesses are compatible with earlier the theoretical models of natta &  hollenbach ( 1998 ) in spite of the fact that those authors point out that the knots do not adhere to their general model and would have a higher surface brightness .",

    "this means that the soft x - ray heating processes and 912 - 1100    ( fuv ) photo - excitation mechanisms ( natta &  hollenbach 1998 ) do not explain the helix observations .",
    "the absence of a stellar wind and other time - scale considerations have already established ( ohf05 ) that shocks can not be powering the h@xmath1  emission and in    4.3 we showed why the justification of h06 for a shocks interpretation is incorrect .",
    "although phillips ( 2006 ) established a loose correlation between soft x - ray flux and h@xmath1  emission , this correlation is probably secondary rather than primary , as there is insufficient x - ray emission to power the h@xmath1  emission ; but , the stars that are strong h@xmath1  emitters have high temperatures , like the central star in the helix nebula .",
    "this means that these stars share the property of the euv radiation being dominant over fuv radiation .",

    "the fact that neutral hydrogen 21 cm is not observed in the inner region of the helix nebula ( rodrguez et  al .",
    "2002 ) where the optically bright knots are found supports this model and the appearance of 21 cm emission from the more distant and fainter outer - ring knots indicates that a neutral hydrogen zone is only present there .",
    "the low ionization parameter found in the helix knots leads to substantial deviations from ionization and thermal equilibrium since the dynamical time is shorter than the ionization and heating times .",
    "the effects of this upon the emission from the ionized gas was discussed at length in ohf05 .",
    "the dissociation of h@xmath50 in such a front is predominantly due to chemical reactions with ionized species such as o@xmath54 , and is therefore a strong function of the ionization fraction , which is determined by the absorption of euv radiation .",
    "the radiation field is largely determined by the opacity in the fraction of hydrogen that is neutral , the key element being its determination of the amount of o@xmath54 .",
    "it is the reaction of o@xmath54 with h@xmath1  that destroys the h@xmath1 rather than the much slower rate of photo - dissociation of h@xmath1 .",
    "this is essentially a one - way process , with h@xmath1  entering the zone from the cold molecular core and being converted directly to h@xmath27 .",
    "this transition zone is heated by the photo - ionization of neutral hydrogen and can be quite broad and the preliminary models indicate that it can produce warm h@xmath1   column densities of about 10@xmath55 @xmath34 , as required by the observations ( ohf05 ) . to the best of our knowledge , no models of such euv - dominated dissociation regions have been calculated .",
    "we are calculating detailed models of such regions , which will be reported upon in a future paper and restrict ourselves here to this brief description .",
    "it is likely that the same process determines the emission seen from the sheath of the tails in 2.12 @xmath0 m .",
    "the first - order theory for shadowed columns behind optically thick knots was presented by cant et  al .",
    "they illustrated that the shadowed regions are illuminated by lyc photons emitted from recombining hydrogen , that this radiation was closer to 13.6 ev than the ionizing stellar radiation , and that the flux density of these diffuse lyc photons was about 0.15 that of the direct lyc flux from the central star .",
    "these diffuse lyc photons are almost certainly the source of the heating of the h@xmath1  in the tails as the surface brightness in 2.12 @xmath0 m  is about 0.23@xmath360.08 that in the directly illuminated bright cusp (   3.6 ) .",
    "the implausibility of shocks is also true here and the shortfall of energy from the fuv radiation is even greater than in the cusps because having a strong diffuse fuv radiation field would demand a large optical depth in dust for the nebula as a whole , which is not indicated by its emission line spectrum . a separate detailed h@xmath1  model is required for the tail because the illuminating fuv will be of lower energy and the density much lower than in the bright cusp .      in a recent paper , meaburn et  al .",

    "the individual exposures were 300 s and in the central region , where the fields of the four different pointings overlap , the effective exposure was 1200 s. a straightforward examination of this image using various levels of brightness and contrast did not reveal the features posited by meaburn et  al .",

    "the results are shown in figure 11 in negative depiction or the highly stretch range of intensities of 0.97 - 1.03 .",
    "one sees no indication of radial features extending inside the radius at which the knots disappear .",

    "this non - detection of such features , even only slightly inside the position of the easily visible bright cusp knots is a strong argument that this boundary indicates where knots were first formed and does not represent a boundary where knots have been destroyed .",

    "although the injected ionized gas is assumed to arise from an ionization front on the head of a neutral globule , the radiation transfer and ionization process is not explicitly included in the models .",

    "our new h@xmath1   observations clearly show (   3.2 ) that the limb - brightened edges of the knot tails correspond to an ionization front . additionally , the width of the tail is equal to the width of the bright cusp at the head of the knot and its conic projection ( odell 2000 ) .",
    "this would seem to conclusively establish that radiation shadowing , rather than hydrodynamic interactions , is the _ primary _ determinant of the structure of the tails . in the stream - source model , although tail widths are predicted to be of the same order as the width of the injection source , there is no reason to expect them to be equal , unless the parameters are fine - tuned .    the kinematic arguments given in support of the stream - source model ( meaburn et al .",

    "spectrophotometry of multiple lines in four sample regions and the total nebular flux ratio in the h@xmath1   0 - 0 s(5 ) and 2.12 @xmath0 m  lines indicates that the h@xmath1  emitting zones are all about 988@xmath36119 k , closely resembling lte .",
    "the 2.12 @xmath0 m  emission from individual knots falls immediately inside the ionized gas zone traced by h@xmath8  emission .",
    "this is true for both the bright cusps and their fainter tails , the latter establishing that the tails are primarily ionizing radiation shadows , rather than the result of purely hydrodynamic processes .",
    "the advection dominated nature of the knot cusps means that there is no extended neutral hydrogen zone between the cold molecular knot core and the ionized gas layer .",
    "this zone of irradiation of h@xmath1  by euv photons is probably the region producing the observed hot gas in the cusps on the star - facing side of the molecular knots and the shadowed regions of the tails .",
    "no evidence was found for knots within the he  ii core nor were earlier claims verified of linear features extending nearly in to the central star , arguing that the knots have only been created outside the high ionization core .",
    "anton koekemoer of the space telescope science institute provided valuable guidance in the use of the drizzle package of tasks , making possible the smooth combination of our multiple observations of the same fields .",

    "<S> we use new hubble space telescope and archived images to clarify the nature of the ubiquitous knots in the helix nebula , which are variously estimated to contain a significant to majority fraction of the material ejected by its central star .    </S>",
    "<S> we employ published far infrared spectrophotometry and existing 2.12 @xmath0 m  images to establish that the population distribution of the lowest ro - vibrational states of h@xmath1   is close to the distribution of a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) at @xmath2  k. in addition , we present calculations that show that the weakness of the h@xmath1   0 - 0 s(7 ) line is not a reason for making the unlikely - to - be true assumption that h@xmath1  emission is caused by shock excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive a total flux from the nebula in h@xmath1  lines and compare this with the power available from the central star for producing this radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we establish that neither soft x - rays nor 9121100     radiation has enough energy to power the h@xmath1  radiation , only the stellar extreme ultraviolet radiation shortward of 912  does . </S>",
    "<S> advection of material from the cold regions of the knots produces an extensive zone where both atomic and molecular hydrogen are found , allowing the h@xmath1  to directly be heated by lyman continuum radiation , thus providing a mechanism that will probably explain the excitation temperature and surface brightness of the 2.12 @xmath0 m   cusps and tails .    </S>",
    "<S> new images of the knot 378 - 801 in the h@xmath1  2.12 @xmath0 m  line reveal that the 2.12 @xmath0 m  cusp lies immediately inside the ionized atomic gas zone . </S>",
    "<S> this property is shared by material in the  tail region . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath1  2.12 @xmath0 m  emission of the cusp confirms previous assumptions , while the tail s property firmly establishes that the  tail \" structure is an ionization bounded radiation shadow behind the optically thick core of the knot . </S>",
    "<S> the new 2.12 @xmath0 m  image together with archived hubble images is used to establish a pattern of decreasing surface brightness and increasing size of the knots with increasing stellar distance . </S>",
    "<S> although the contrast against the background is greater in 2.12 @xmath0 m   than in the optical lines , the higher resolution and signal of optical images remains the most powerful technique for searching for knots .    </S>",
    "<S> a unique new image of a transitional region of the nebula s inner disk in the heii 4686    line fails to show any emission from knots that might have been found in the he@xmath3 core of the nebula . </S>",
    "<S> we also re - examined high signal - to - noise ratio ground - based telescope images of this same inner region and found no evidence of structures that could be related to knots . </S>"
