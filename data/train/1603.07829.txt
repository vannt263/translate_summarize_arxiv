    "it is relatively easy to obtain self - consistent models of spherical or disk  like stellar systems with simple numerical ( e.g. , king models ) or even analytical tools ( e.g. , schuster or plummer models ) , as explained in textbooks like the one by @xcite .",
    "models of elliptical galaxies are much more difficult to build , however , as there is observational evidence , both statistical ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and on individual galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that shows that at least some ellipticals are triaxial , and full fledged 3d models demand resorting to special techniques .",
    "besides , surface brightness studies of ellipticals tend to show central cusps ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that reveal the presence of mass concentrations and probably black holes , and triaxial and cuspy potentials favor the appearance of chaotic orbits ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) further complicating model building for those objects .",
    "two main methods are employed to build self  consistent models of elliptical galaxies : the one due to @xcite and the @xmath0body method , originally proposed by @xcite to build a bar and later on applied to ellipticals by @xcite .",
    "the former chooses a potential  density pair , builds a library of orbits in that potential and determines the fraction of each type of orbit needed to obtain the corresponding density .",
    "the @xmath0body method adopts an initial distribution of point masses and integrates the equations of motion until an equilibrium distribution is reached ; a smooth and constant potential is then fitted to that distribution and the positions and velocities of the bodies are used to investigate the orbits in that potential .",
    "@xcite himself noted the difficulty to include chaotic orbits in models built with his method , which turned out to evolve over intervals of the order of a hubble time , and the problem became even more serious when cuspy models were adopted ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although it was suggested that models containing chaotic orbits could not be stable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perfectly stable models with large fractions of chaotic orbits were built with the @xmath0body method @xcite , including cuspy ones @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite argued that there was no physical constrain to build self  consistent stable models with chaotic orbits and that the problem dealt with the method of @xcite itself .",
    "a comprehensive recent discussion of this matter can be found in the paper by @xcite .",
    "the present series of papers uses the @xmath0body method to build models of cuspy triaxial stellar systems and investigate their stability and orbital content , both regular and chaotic . in our first paper , @xcite built models resembling e2 , e3 , e4 and e5 galaxies and they showed that they were extremely stable over intervals of the order of a hubble time , even though they contained fractions of chaotic orbits that exceeded 75 per cent .",
    "the regular orbits of those models were studied , in our second paper , by @xcite , and they found that most of those orbits were short  axis tubes , that the fraction of long  axis tubes decreased from the e2 through the e5 models and that most of the boxes were resonant orbits , i.e. , boxlets .",
    "a curious puzzle was posed by the work of @xcite who , using the @xmath0body method , built cuspy triaxial models with essentially no chaotic orbits , so that we reexamined their investigation in the third paper of our series @xcite .",
    "we found that their discrepancy with the other @xmath0body works had two causes : their use of a poor method to detect chaos and a velocity distribution in their model much more isotropic than that of other authors ( low angular momentum orbits are more likely to be chaotic ) .    now , all our previous models are either non  rotating or have exceedingly slow figure rotation , but rotation is a key ingredient of the dynamics of elliptical galaxies , and the pioneer works of @xcite and @xcite showed that they have angular momentum , even though the resulting rotation is small enough that in most cases the ellipticity of those galaxies can not be attributed to the rotation itself .",
    "all the investigations performed using the @xmath0body method found large fractions of chaotic orbits in the non  rotating or very slowly rotating systems , and the comparison done by @xcite of his rotating model with the same non  rotating one of @xcite suggests that rotation should increase those fractions .",
    "the works of @xcite , and @xcite are among the few in which a rotating model is used to study the dynamics of elliptical galaxies , but the former does not mention chaotic orbits and the latter does not accept that they could contribute significantly to a stable stellar system .",
    "the difficulties of the method of schwarzschild to accomodate chaotic orbits have been mentioned above ; besides , @xcite do not use a self consistent model , but only investigate orbits in a rotating triaxial generalization of the potential of @xcite .",
    "the recent work of @xcite is a welcome addition to the subject but , although they indicate the presence of chaoticity in their models and that in general it increased with pattern speed , the information they provide on chaos is rather scanty .",
    "thus , we decided to try to build self  consistent , rotating , cuspy , triaxial models using the @xmath0body method , in order to find out the degree of chaos that such models harbour and the distribution of the regular orbits , and that is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the following section describes the numerical techniques we used to build our models , and their stability is investigated in section 3 .",
    "section 4 describes the matter and figure rotation of the models , and section 5 analyzes its orbital composition , both chaotic and regular .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "in order to create stable , cuspy , rotating triaxial models , we take the already stable , cuspy and triaxial models dubbed e2a and e5a of the first paper of this series @xcite , containing each one @xmath1 bodies . in these models , and in the rest of this work , the gravitational constant @xmath2 , the total mass @xmath3 and the crossing time @xmath4 is equivalent to about 1/200 of the hubble time . the slope @xmath5 of the cusp in both models , computed as the slope of the @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 line for the innermost 10,000 particles binned in bins of 100 particles each , is @xmath8 .",
    "the semiaxes @xmath9 obtained from the 80 per cent most tightly bound particles are in the ratios @xmath10 , @xmath11 for the e2a model , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 for the e5a model .",
    "the triaxiality of the e2a model is @xmath14 , whereas that of the e5a model is @xmath15 .",
    "we perform the @xmath0body integrations with the self  consistent field ( scf ) code of @xcite , the same used by @xcite to build their models .",
    "the code solves the poisson s equation by expanding the density and the potential in a set of basis functions chosen in such way that the lowest order term corresponds to the model of @xcite .",
    "the motion of the bodies is followed with a time  centered leapfrog algorithm that keeps time reversibility .",
    "@xcite performed several tests to choose the number of radial and angular terms in the expansion to finally adopt @xmath16 radial and @xmath17 angular terms for their models , and those are the same numbers we use here .    to quantify the angular momentum acquired by each model",
    ", we computed the specific angular momentum introduced by @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total angular momentum and energy of the model , respectively .    in order to add rotation while maintaining the triaxiality and the cuspiness of the models , we proceeded in the following way .",
    "first , we gave to each model a certain amount of rotation by adding to each particle at position @xmath21 and with velocity @xmath22 an angular velocity @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath24    now , this simple recipe has a major flaw : it changes the energy of the model , which should be kept in order to maintain as much as possible its other characteristics .",
    "one way to procceed is to substract from the velocity modulus of each particle an amount necessary to conserve the total energy after applying the rotation .",
    "the substracted fraction @xmath25 should be the same for each particle in order to keep the kinematical structure of the model .",
    "one then has , equalizing the initial and final kinetic energies , @xmath26,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the mass of the @xmath28-th particle , and @xmath0 is the number of particles . solving for @xmath29",
    ", it may happen that the resulting quadratic polynomial has imaginary roots .",
    "this means that the amount of rotational energy injected into the system is so large that it does nt allow to recover the initial kinetic energy ( that is , there are particles which must have less than zero velocity to achieve that ) . in any other case ,",
    "since the linear coefficient @xmath30 is approximately zero for a non - rotating system , we expect that the two roots be opposite each other .",
    "moreover , calling @xmath31 the coefficient that multiplies @xmath32 and @xmath33 the independent term , it can be easily seen that @xmath34 , so that the moduli of the roots will be less than 1 .",
    "thus , except for the imaginary case , a unique value @xmath25 is expected among the roots , as was always the case . with the value of @xmath29 ,",
    "the new velocities are computed by means of @xmath35    as already said , with this procedure only a maximum amount of angular velocity can be applied to a given model .",
    "for example , the rotation that could be added to the e2a model amounted to @xmath36 , whereas that of the e5a model was @xmath37 .",
    "thus we tried to add more angular momentum in the following way .",
    "we first let each model relax for 50 @xmath4 , using the scf code .",
    "after that , we aligned the coordinate axes with the semiaxes of the inertia tensor of the 80 per cent most tightly bound particles of each model , so that the @xmath38 axis coincided with the semimajor axis and the @xmath39 axis with the semiminor axis , and eliminated the particles with positive energy and the 2 per cent of the remainder that have energies closer to zero .",
    "then , we added a new amount of angular velocity .",
    "since to do this we can not follow the abovementioned procedure ( a fraction of the velocities of the particles are already part of the angular motion , which we do not want to substract ) , we included in the computation the old angular velocity , dubbed now @xmath40 , yielding @xmath41\\right\\}. \\label{cambiodos}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    now the quadratic polynomial can have roots of different moduli and , in principle , with the same sign . nevertheless , physically we expect that the reduction in energy by decreasing the velocities should be possible ( so two negative roots are not expected ) , and that only one way to do it is feasible ( so two positive roots are not expected either ) .",
    "thus , the resulting roots should be one positive and one negative ( which was always the case ) . once the velocities have been reduced again using eq .",
    "( [ cambiodos ] ) , the whole procedure is repeated ( including the rotation of the axes and the relaxation ) until the amount of angular motion to be added can not be made much different from zero .    for the e2a model , the second introduction of angular momentum was the last to produce a significant growth of @xmath42 , whereas in the case of the e5a model",
    ", it was the third one .",
    "the final values were @xmath43 for the e2a model , and @xmath44 for the e5a model .",
    "then , we let the models relax during 200 @xmath4 ( about a hubble time ) ; the final snapshot was again rotated using the moments of the inertia tensor of the 80 per cent most tightly bound particles . these last systems ( one for each model ) were evolved during an additional interval of 300 @xmath4 in order to verify their stability . for each of the two models ,",
    "the snapshot corresponding to 100 @xmath4 of this last evolution was the one used to study and classify the respective orbital contents ; we call them e2af and e5af , respectively , for brevity .",
    "[ ge2a ] shows the kinematic and structural characteristics of the e2af model . in this figure",
    ", the abscisae @xmath45 stands for the ellipsoidal radius @xmath46 where @xmath31 , @xmath47 and @xmath33 are the semiaxes of the model , computed following the method of @xcite , as adapted by @xcite ; @xmath48 , on the other hand , is the same as @xmath45 but projected onto the coordinate planes .",
    "the abscisae @xmath49 is the mass interior to radius @xmath50 in units of the total mass of the model .",
    "the upper left panel shows the density profile of the model , computed using ellipsoidal shells with constant axial ratios taken at the half - mass radius .",
    "as can be seen , the rotation has not substantially affected the cusp of the model ( @xmath51 , computed from the densities of the 10,000 innermost particles binned in 100 intervals of distance to the center ) .",
    "the upper right panel shows the axial ratios , computed in shells each containing 3 per cent of the particles , previously sorted by energy .",
    "the ratios of the semiaxes of the shell containing 81 per cent of the mass in its interior are @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in good agreement with the values that correspond to the 80 per cent most tightly bound bodies ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) , i.e. , the parameters used in our previous works .",
    "comparing these values with those of the original e2a model , we can see that the @xmath57 ratio has increased , whereas the @xmath58 ratio and the triaxiality have decreased .",
    "the bottom panels show the kinematical profiles , in which @xmath59 , where @xmath28 is a cartesian direction @xmath38 , @xmath60 or @xmath39 in the left panel , and @xmath50 ( radial ) or @xmath61 ( tangential ) direction in the right panel .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath62 .",
    "[ ge5a ] shows the same characteristics but for the e5af model .",
    "again , the cusp is well preserved ( @xmath63 ) . in this case , for the same shell as before , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , while for the 80 per cent most tightly bound particles , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , i.e. , both axial ratios have increased and the triaxiality decreased with respect to the e5a model . it might seem odd that rotation has not made the model flatter , but it should be recalled that the process that led from the non  rotating to the rotating model implied considerable changes in structure of the former .",
    "for example , about 30 per cent of the original particles were eliminated because they increased their energies beyond the established limits , and the @xmath31 semiaxis was reduced to about half its initial size .    in order to estimate the meaning of our length unit ( l.u . ) and time unit ( t.u . ) for real galaxies , we computed the effective radii @xmath69 from the @xmath70 projection ( 0.142 and 0.0794 l.u .",
    ", respectively , for the e2af and e5af models ) and the central radial velocity dispersion @xmath71 from the @xmath60 components of the velocities of the @xmath72 particles closer to the centre on that projection ( 0.987 and 1.099 l.u./t.u .",
    ", respectively , for the e2af and e5af models ) .",
    "as in our previous work @xcite , we chose for comparison galaxies ngc1379 and ngc4697 @xcite , whose mass - to - light ratio gradients are zero . comparing their observed values of @xmath69 ( 2.5 and 5.7 kpc , respectively ) and",
    "@xmath71 ( 128 and 180 km s@xmath73 , respectively ) with those from our models , we conclude that values between about 18 and 72 kpc can be used as our length unit and values between about 0.14 and 0.44 gyr as our time unit .",
    "then , the hubble time can be estimated as between 32 and 100 t.u . , or between 180 and 290 @xmath4 , and we will adopt a value of 250 @xmath4 , hereafter .",
    "we used the final 300@xmath4 runs to check for systematic changes in the density @xmath74 of the innermost 10,000 particles , the moments of inertia @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 for each axis , and @xmath5 .",
    "to improve the precision , straight lines were fitted to the results obtained every 25@xmath4 and we obtained the percentage variation corresponding to 250@xmath4 , i.e. , one hubble time according to our estimate .",
    "the results are presented in table [ stable ] and the changes are very small , indeed . moreover , as we have shown before @xcite , even those tiny variations are most likely not real but due to relaxation effects of the @xmath0body code @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since our models are rotating , what is conserved is not the energy of a particle in the fixed reference frame of the @xmath0body code , but its energy in the frame that rotates with the ellipsoidal figure , i.e. , the jacobi integral ( leaving aside the numerical relaxation effects , of course ) . therefore , even though we eliminated the particles with positive , and slightly negative , energy in the former reference frame , there are still particles that can escape from the system . as explained by @xcite , particles that have values of the jacobi integral larger than the value of the effective potential at the @xmath78 and @xmath79 lagrangian points or that are initially outside the contour through those points , can _ in principle _ escape from the system but , due to the protective effect of the coriolis force ,",
    "that does not mean that those particles will _ necessarily _ escape .",
    "we obtained the limiting values of the jacobi integral as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , for the e2af and e5af models , and found that 123,417 ( or 15.6 per cent ) and 140,252 ( or 20.5 per cent ) particles , respectively , exceeded those limits .",
    "nevertheless , after the 300@xmath4 evolution , only 7 ( or 0.00088 per cent ) and 112 ( or 0.016 per cent ) particles from the e2af and e5af models , respectively , were found at a distance from the center that exceeded that of the initially most distant particle in the corresponding model .",
    "thus , we can conclude that our models are extremely stable over intervals of the order of one hubble time .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ axrpf ]      the frequency analysis was performed , as in our previous papers @xcite , with the modified fourier transform code of @xcite ( a copy can be obtained at www.boulder.swri.edu/@xmath82davidn ) and adopting as initial conditions the positions and velocities of the same bodies we had selected for the computation of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "for each one of the 2,117 regular orbits of the two models , we obtained the fundamental frequencies for each coordinate , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , through the frequency analysis of the complex variables @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively ; these were derived from 8,192 points equally spaced in time obtained integrating the orbits over 300 radial periods .",
    "as indicated by @xcite , the frequencies of isolated lines obtained in this way have errors smaller than @xmath89 , but the precision is much lower when there are nearby lines , and here we adopt the practical limit of @xmath90 for the precision , as in our previous works .",
    "we obtained the fundamental frequencies using the method of @xcite with the improvements introduced by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the original method took the frequency of the largest amplitude in each coordinate as the fundamental frequency for that coordinate but , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , the libration of some orbits and the extreme elongation of others makes necessary to adopt , for these cases , other frequencies as the fundamental ones , and the improvements deal with those cases .    in our previous work on non- , or very slowly , rotating systems , the fundamental frequencies were used to classify the regular orbits as long and short axis tubes ( lats and sats , respectively ) and boxes and boxlets ( bbls ) , but the orbital composition of rotating systems is much more varied and complex and that classification is not enough . besides , although it is not unfrequent to find those same names used for orbits in rotating systems , it should be recalled that things are quite different in fixed and rotating systems of reference ( e.g. , a bbl in one system may be a sat in another one ) .",
    "as we will see below , most of the regular orbits in our models are resonant , i.e. , their fundamental frequencies obey one or two equations of the form :    @xmath91    with @xmath92 and @xmath93 integers not all equal to zero .",
    "therefore , in what follows we will refer to the different orbits mainly by their resonances , i.e. , @xmath94 in the equation above .",
    "besides , we will not restrict ourselves to frequency analysis and we will add other criteria ( like the conservation of the signs of the components of the angular momentum and plots of the orbits ) to aid the orbital classification .    of the 2,117 orbits regarded as regular , 122 yielded values of their fundamental frequencies that did not obey that @xmath95 .",
    "as in our previous works , visual inspection of their spectra showed that many of them were typical of chaotic orbits , with lines of similar frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "we checked that possibility obtaining the ft - lcns of those orbits using an integration time of 100,000 t.u .",
    ", i.e. ten times longer than the one of subsection [ subchao ] , and 44 of the 122 suspicious orbits turned out to be actually chaotic .",
    "besides , it should be recalled that in rotating systems there are orbits whose fundamental frequencies might not be obtained with the same criteria used for non  rotating ones .",
    "for example , another 11 of those 78 orbits had a frequency line with @xmath84 close to zero , i.e. , they were horseshoe orbits ( two examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ shoe ] ) .    fig .",
    "[ fmap ] presents the frequency maps for both models .",
    "orbits that do not obey @xmath95 , mentioned above , are not included , but we notice four cases of model e2af and one of model e5af in odd positions of the diagrams .",
    "orbit 2166 of model e2af , at @xmath96 , and orbit 773 of model e5af , at @xmath97 , are just horseshoes .",
    "visual inspection of the frequency spectra of orbits 1706 , at @xmath98 , and 1870 , at @xmath99 , of model e2af showed that they are very complex , making very difficult to select the fundamental frequencies .",
    "plots of those orbits suggest that they are boxlets that avoid the center of the system ; besides , they do not conserve the sign of the components of the angular momentum and both obey the @xmath100 resonance .",
    "the frequency spectrum of orbit 3390 of model e2af , at @xmath101 , was clearly chaotic and the chaoticity of that orbit was confirmed recomputing its ft - lcns with a 100,000 u.t . interval .",
    "the most striking feature of fig . [ fmap ] is the complete lack of representative points at @xmath102 for @xmath103 , i.e. , the @xmath104 resonant orbits , or the lats of non  rotating systems .",
    "nevertheless , the points at @xmath102 and @xmath105 are not single points but each one includes many orbits ( 35 for model e2af and 61 for model e5af ) that obey both the @xmath106 and @xmath104 resonances . all those from the e2af model",
    "conserve the sign of the @xmath38 component of the angular momentum , but only 13 of them conserve the sign of the @xmath39 component as well : they are tubes with their axes in the @xmath70 plane , but not in the @xmath107 plane , i.e. , they are inclined with respect to the latter plane , and the conservation of the sign of the @xmath39 component depends on the tilt and the width of the tube .",
    "an example is shown on the left side of fig .",
    "[ satlat ] .",
    "59 of the 61 cases of the e5af model are also tilted tubes like those of model e2af , but their tilts and widths are such that all conserve the signs of both the @xmath38 and @xmath39 components of the angular momentum .",
    "the remaining two cases do not conserve the sign of the @xmath38 component of the angular momentum and plots of those orbits showed that they are tubes around the lagrangian point l5 , or like horseshoes long enough to close onto themselves .",
    "in fact , when the angular momentum is computed with respect to l5 , the sign of its @xmath39 component is conserved for those orbits .",
    "one of them is shown on the right side of fig .",
    "[ satlat ] .    another interesting feature of our frequency maps is that they are dominated by the diagonal @xmath108 , i.e. , the @xmath106 resonance , that in non - rotating systems corresponds to the sats .",
    "in fact , most of the orbits in those diagonals in fig .",
    "[ fmap ] are also sats : after excluding those with @xmath102 and the horseshoes mentioned above , there remain 857 in model e2af and 916 in model e5af , with 591 of the former and 802 of the latter conserving the sign of the @xmath39 component of the angular momentum , i.e. , they are sats as shown in the two examples of fig .",

    "[ pretzfish ] .",
    "we have shown here that it is possible , starting from a non - rotating self - consistent @xmath0body model of a triaxial and cuspy stellar system , to create a similar rotating one by adding rotation to its particles and letting it to relax towards a new equilibrium .",
    "the outcome is a system with differential rotation , with the angular velocity depending both on the distance to the center and on the height above the equatorial plane , but with a very uniform figure rotation . besides , these models are highly stable over intervals of the order of a hubble time .",
    "@xcite had shown that the density distribution of their models mimics that of elliptical galaxies and our figs .",
    "[ ge2a ] and [ ge5a ] ( upper left ) show the same for the present models .",

    "it turns out to be of the same order of magnitude than our own values .    to investigate figure rotation observations alone are not enough and models have to be fitted to them .",
    "@xcite did this for the old elliptical ngc 4365 and they found hints of figure rotation , roughly estimating a period of about 5 gyr , somewhat longer than for our models",
    ". it should be noted , however , that their model rotates about the semimajor axis , rather than the small axis as our models do .",
    "interestingly , they found that ngc 4365 is triaxial , with @xmath118 , i.e. , very similar to the triaxiality of our model e2af ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "about two thirds of the orbits in our models are chaotic and bodies on regular , partially and fully chaotic orbits have different spatial distributions .",
    "the elliptical galaxies that our chaotic models represent would have rotation periods within @xmath119 years range , thus confirming the suggestion of @xcite that unstable orbits appear within that range .",
    "neverthelss , we can not agree with their statement that stable systems are unlikely to have rotation speeds that produce a high level of stochasticity , as our own models prove otherwise .",
    "we had shown in our previous investigations that non- , or very slowly , rotating triaxial stellar models with very high fractions of chaotic orbits can be perfectly stable ; now the present work extends that conclusion to rotating models as well .",
    "regular families are dominated by far by the sats .",
    "the fractions of boxes and boxlets are low as are those of horseshoes and orbits that cross themselves , typical of rotating systems .",
    "the lats are replaced by tubes whose axes lie on the short  long axes plane , but do not coincide with the major axis .",
    "finallly , it is interesting to compare our frequency maps with those of @xcite , who investigated sample orbits in a rotating triaxial @xcite potential , i.e , without considering self consistency .",

    "<S> we built two self  consistent models of triaxial , cuspy , rotating stellar systems adding rotation to non - rotating models presented in previous papers of this series . </S>",
    "<S> the final angular velocity of the material is not constant and varies with the distance to the center and with the height over the equator of the systems , but the figure rotation is very uniform in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> even though the addition of rotation to the models modifies their original semiaxes ratios , the final rotating models are considerably flattened and triaxial . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the orbital content of the models shows that about two thirds of their orbits are chaotic yet the models are very stable over intervals of the order of one hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of regular orbits are short axis tubes , while long axis tubes are replaced by tubes whose axes lie on the short  long axes plane , but do not coincide with the major axis </S>",
    "<S> . other types of regular orbits that do not appear in non  rotating systems , like horseshoes and orbits that cross themselves , are also found in the present models . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our frequency maps show empty regions where studies of orbits on fixed potentials found orbits , a likely consequence of the self  consistency of our models that excludes them .    </S>",
