    "most o and b stars are congregated into ob associations @xcite in which young low- ( classical t tauri stars , or cttss ) and intermediate - mass ( herbig ae / be stars , or haebe ) stellar groups are also found ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . what is the relationship between the formation of massive stars and that of low - mass stars ?",
    "does star formation in an ob association proceed in a bimodal manner for massive and for low - mass stellar groups ?",
    "if so , which group would form first ?",
    "it is noted that massive stars have a profound influence on the surrounding molecular clouds . on the one hand , the radiation and energetic wind from a massive star could cause the evaporation of nearby clouds , hence terminating the star formation processes . on the other hand",
    ", the massive star could provide `` just the touch '' needed to prompt the collapse of a molecular cloud which otherwise may not contract and fragment spontaneously .",
    "do massive stars play primarily a destructive or promotional role in star formation in a molecular cloud ?",
    "@xcite suggests that low- and intermediate - mass stars form first in an ob association , but soon after massive o stars appear , the cloud is disrupted , which hinders further star formation .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite propose that low - mass stars form first out of cloud fragments and are distributed throughout the entire molecular cloud .",
    "once the o stars form , their expanding ionization fronts ( i - fronts ) then play a constructive role in inciting a sequence of star formation in neighboring molecular clouds .",
    "the triggering of star formation by massive stars appears to take place on different length scales @xcite",
    ". the scoob2 association might be one example of triggered star formation @xcite . in this case the upper centaurus lupus subgroup was formed first in the middle of the molecular cloud complex , which then prompted star formation on both sides , eventually becoming the upper scorpius and lower centaurus crux associations .",
    "@xcite propose a similar mechanism , but with a series of supernova explosions as the triggering sources .",
    "the star formation activities can be sustained as long as stars massive enough are produced in the sequence and there is enough surrounding material .",
    "this sequential formation process leads naturally to an age spread among member stars or subgroups @xcite , and the stellar aggregates thus formed ( out of separate clouds ) tend to be sparsely distributed and gravitationally unbound because of the expanding i - fronts or an initially unbound giant molecular cloud ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    on a smaller scale ,",
    "the signature of ongoing star formation , such as young stellar jets , evaporated gaseous globules ( eggs ) and water masers have been found in the periphery of regions @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of triggering mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,  collect - and - collapse \" and radiation - driven implosion ( rdi ) . in the collect - and - collapse scenario first proposed by @xcite and recently demonstrated observationally by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "the expanding i - fronts from an region piles up a shell of dense gas and dust , in which clumps fragment and collapse to form the next generation of stars . in the rdi scenario @xcite , the formation sequence begins with photoionization of a nearby molecular cloud by a massive star .",
    "the shock fronts embracing the surface of the cloud compress the cloud until reaching the critical density for gravitational collapse resulting in the formation of new stars .",
    "the latest star formation , as traced by protostellar cores @xcite or water masers @xcite , takes place at the compressed layer of a cloud .",
    "@xcite propose a scenario in which an egg appears when a dense clump is impinged upon by the i - fronts .",
    "the photoevaporation then erodes the circumstellar disk into a protoplanetary disk , or a `` proplyd '' @xcite .",
    "subsequently formed massive stars can carve out their own cavities to continue the triggering process @xcite .",
    "the exposure of the protoplanetary disk in such environments would , in addition to being truncated in size , contain short - lived radio nuclides from the ejecta from one or more nearby supernovae , such as has been observed in meteorites in the solar system @xcite . our results",
    "substantiate the above sequential star formation scenario by providing clear chronological and positional evidence that massive stars prompt the birth of lower - mass stars out of molecular clouds .    in the orion star - forming region for example",
    ", there is concrete evidence of triggered star formation as manifested by the bright - rimmed clouds ( brcs ) in the vicinity of o stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "these brcs are considered the remnant of molecular clouds that have been photoionized by a nearby massive star @xcite .",
    "according to paper  i , only brcs that are associated with strong @xmath1 100  @xmath2 emission ( tracer of high density ) and h@xmath3 emission ( tracer of the ionization front ) show signs of ongoing star formation .",
    "furthermore , cttss are more likely seen between the o stars and the brcs , with those closer to the brcs being progressively younger , and there are no cttss far ahead of the i - fronts .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study to the lacob1 association as well as include intermediate - mass young stars in our sample .",
    "we describe in  2 the archival data and our spectroscopic and imaging observations .",
    "in addition to the lacob1 sources , some of the stars in oriob1 considered in paper  i to be young star candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "these results are also presented here . finally , we discuss star - formation activities and histories in @xmath0 ori , oriob1 , and lacob1 in  3 , and consider star formation in general in ob associations in  4 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "cttss are young stellar objects characterized by their infrared excess .",
    "usually cttss are more likely to be spatially closer to a star - forming region than are the weak - line t tauri stars ( wttss ) .",
    "the latter are also pms stars , but are more evolved than cttss in terms of clearing of their inner circumstellar disks .",
    "thus the cttss trace more recent star formation . in paper",
    "i , we proposed an empirical set of criteria to select ctts candidates from the 2mass point source catalog @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we apply the same selection procedure ( e.g. , 2mass colors , good photometric qualities , and exclusion of extended sources ) but include young intermediate - mass stars , the haebe stars into our sample .",
    "different young stellar populations , wttss , cttss , and haebe stars occupy distinctly different regions in the 2mass color - color diagram ( see paper  i ) . the haebe stars in general exhibit larger infrared excess than cttss do",
    ". therefore we select as haebe star candidates 2mass point sources with colors redder than the line defined by @xmath4 ; ctts candidates are selected by the same method described in paper  i , namely between the two parallel lines , @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and above the dereddened ctts locus @xcite , @xmath6 .",
    "table  1 shows the fields in the @xmath0 ori region , oriob1 , and lacob1 studied in this paper , which include 7 brcs , one comet - shaped cloud and two control regions .",
    "in addition to the 2mass point - source database from which we select our ctts and haebe candidates , we also make use of the h@xmath3 emission survey data @xcite , @xmath7 reddening @xcite , @xmath1 100  @xmath2 , and co @xcite emission to trace , respectively , the distribution of the ionization fronts , cloud extinction , ir radiation , and molecular clouds with respect to the spatial distribution of our young star sample .",
    "the spectra of bright ctts and haebe candidates were taken at the beijing astronomical observatory ( bao ) and at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) . at the bao ,",
    "low - dispersion spectra with a dispersion of 200  mm@xmath8 , corresponding to 4.8  pixel@xmath8 , were taken with the 2.16  m optical telescope from 2003 october  31 to november  3 , and on 2004 september 56 .",
    "an omr ( optomechanics research , inc . )",
    "spectrograph was used with a tektronix 1024@xmath91024 ccd detector covering 40009000   .",
    "these spectra were used to confirm the young stellar nature ( e.g. , the h@xmath3 and other characteristic emission lines ) of the pms star candidates selected on the basis of the 2mass colors .",
    "medium - dispersion spectra for a selected set of sample stars were taken with the kpno 2.1  m telescope on 2004 january 25 .",
    "the goldcamera spectrometer , with a ford 3  k@xmath91  k ccd with 15  @xmath2 pixels , was used with the grating # 26new , giving a dispersion of 1.24  pixel@xmath8 .",
    "these medium - dispersion spectra allowed us to identify the lithium absorption at 6708   , the spectral signature of a low - mass pms star .",
    "all the spectroscopic data were processed with the standard noao / iraf packages .",
    "after correction for bias and flat - fields , the iraf package kpnoslit was used to extract and to calibrate the wavelength and flux of each spectrum . to check the legitimacy of our selection criteria ,",
    "we also observed two control fields , in addition to the star - forming clouds .",
    "all the fields included in this study are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the brcs were imaged on 2004 november 38 using the 1  m telescope at the lulin observatory in taiwan ( table  2 ) .",
    "a pi1300b ( roper scientific ) ccd camera was used , which has @xmath10 pixels , each 20  @xmath2 square , yielding a @xmath11 field of view . h@xmath3 ( @xmath12   , @xmath13(fwhm)=30   ) images were taken for all brcs .",
    "in addition , lbn437 was observed with an [ ] ( @xmath14   , @xmath13(fwhm)=80   ) filter . for every target field tens of images",
    "were taken , each with an exposure time of 120 to 300  s. the images were processed for bias , dark and flat - fielding corrections with the standard procedures .      the main purpose of the spectral observations was to identify pms star candidates and to validate the selection criteria for haebe stars .",
    "the imaging observations can help us to trace the distribution of the i - fronts in the brcs . by combining the spectral and imaging observations",
    ", we can study the spatial distribution of pms stars relative to i - fronts in brcs .",
    "tables  3 , 4 , and 5 list , respectively , the cttss ( plus some ctts candidates ) , haebe stars , and non - pms sources identified from spectroscopic observations . in table  3 , stars 131 cttss are in orion and 3240 cttss are in lacerta . in table  4 , stars 4148 are haebe stars in the orion region , whereas the others are in the lacerta region .",
    "we derive the h@xmath3 , [ ] , and [ ] equivalent widths of the cttss .",
    "some of the cttss listed in table  3 do not show lithium absorption , but exhibit other ctts characteristics , such as the h@xmath3 , , and/or forbidden [ ] and [ ] emission line(s ) in their spectra .",
    "since most of these spectra show veiling , their li absorption line might be veiled by continuum radiation .",
    "thus they are included in the ctts sample ( table  3 ) even though the li line is not readily discernible .",
    "cttss without a li absorption line are not unusual ; recently @xcite also found a lithium - depleted ctts , st34 , in the taurus - auriga t association .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] presents an example of the spectra of a ctts and a haebe star .",
    "no pms stars were found in any of the two control fields ; most of the sources there are either carbon stars or m giants .    figure  [ fig : oriob1 ] and figure  [ fig : lamori ] show , respectively , the trapezium and the @xmath0ori regions in orion , with the cttss ( stars 131 in table  3 ) and haebe stars ( stars 4148 in table  4 ) being marked .",
    "the boxes mark the fields of the h@xmath3 images presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : lot1 ] .",
    "it is clear that the brcs are outlined by the h@xmath3 emission , and that some pms stars are spatially close to the i - fronts .",
    "figure  [ fig : lac ] displays the @xmath1 100  @xmath2 , h@xmath3 and co emission maps of the lacob1 association . the pms stars in table  3 and table  4",
    "are again marked .",
    "the box indicates the lbn437 region shown in figure  [ fig : lot2 ] .",
    "lbn437 is a comet - shaped brc @xcite .",
    "the haebe star v375lac ( star  52 in table  4 ) associated with this cloud is believed to be the exciting source of the parsec - scale herbig - haro outflow hh398 @xcite .    in paper  i it was shown that cttss exhibiting continuous or veiled spectra with [ ] and/or [ ] forbidden lines , originating from jets or winds seen commonly in class  i sources @xcite , tend to be redder , which is suggestive of a younger age , than those without .",
    "a color - color diagram of the pms stars in tables  3 and 4 is plotted as fig .",
    "[ fig : colors ] ; the results agree with our previous work .",
    "this correlation extends to haebe stars , in that haebe stars with forbidden line(s ) are mostly located on the upper right of the 2mass color - color diagram . as an alternative to being younger , a ctts with forbidden lines could be the result of reduced photoevaporation of the circumstellar disk , e.g. , by being away from a luminous star or shielded by a molecular cloud .",
    "only 14 of the 40 cttss and 4 of the 13 haebe stars in our sample show forbidden line(s ) in their spectra . in other words , about one third of the pms stars with strong infrared excess exhibit forbidden line(s ) .",
    "typical ctts ages are a few myr @xcite , with those with forbidden lines representing an even younger sample , probably no more than a couple myr old .",
    "the [ ] line is only present in star 2 , a ctts with a strong infrared excess and strong [ ] ( equivalent width @xmath15 10.5  ) . in our sample of cttss",
    "there is no correlation between the h@xmath3 equivalent widths and the presence of forbidden lines , or between the h@xmath3 equivalent widths and the 2mass colors .",
    "the success rate of spectroscopic confirmation of ctts and haebe candidates is extremely high for @xmath0 ori , oriob1 or lacob1 .",
    "candidates closely associated with star - forming regions all turned out to be bona fide young stars with essentially no exception , whereas the regions away from molecular clouds are mostly populated by evolved stars ( e.g. , carbon stars or m giants ) .",
    "the 2mass database enables us to effectively trace recent star formation on a large scale , without any a priori bias toward prominent or reflection nebulae which are obvious targets to search for young stellar objects .",
    "for example , stars 3538 in our sample are confirmed to be young stars .",
    "they are located away from prominent nebulosity , so it might otherwise be difficult to recognize them as young stars in a targeted survey .",
    "star formation triggered by the rdi mechanism has several characteristics which can be diagnosed observationally : ( 1 )  the remnant cloud is extended toward , or pointing to , the massive stars .",
    "( 2 )  the young stellar groupings in the region are roughly lined up between the remnant clouds and the luminous star .",
    "( 3 )  stars closer to the cloud , which have formed later in the sequence , are younger in age , with the youngest stars being in the interacting region , i.e. , along the bright rim of the cloud .",
    "( 4 )  no young stars exist far behind the brc .",
    "in particular , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are in distinct contrast to the case of spontaneous star formation , which conceivably would not have left such distinguishing temporal and positional signposts . in table  6",
    "we summarize the different outcomes of the triggered versus spontaneous star formation processes .    in paper",
    "i , we presented evidence supporting the induced star formation in six orion brcs , namely b30 , b35 , orieast , ic2118 , ldn1616 , and ldn1634 . here , we present further spectroscopic observations of the orion sources , classified as young star `` candidates '' in paper  i and extend our sample to include the lacob1 region .",
    "combined with the earlier oriob1 results , this reinforces the links between massive stars , brcs , and the formation of low - mass stars .",
    "furthermore , our young star sample now contains not only cttss , but also young intermediate - mass stars , rendering a more comprehensive understanding of the origin of stellar masses in an ob association .",
    "ic2118 , ldn1616 , and ldn1634 are three isolated brcs around the trapezium to the west of the oriona .",
    "another brc , orieast , can be found to the north - east of the trapezium .",
    "all these brcs point roughly to the trapezium ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oriob1 ] ) , indicative of the trapezium and/or the orion - eridanus superbubble being the shaping source of these brcs @xcite .    in this region most cttss with forbidden line(s ) ,",
    "i.e. , those of younger ages , are spatially close to the brcs , e.g. , stars 1 , 2 , and 30 in relation to ldn1616 , ic2118 , and orieast , respectively . star  7 is also associated with a remnant molecular cloud @xcite ( their cloud  6 ) .",
    "b30 and b35 are two brcs associated with an region excited by the o8  iii star @xmath0 ori and surrounded by a ring - shaped molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "@xcite find some 80 h@xmath3 stars in the @xmath0 ori region , most of which are distributed as a barlike structure extending from either side of @xmath0ori to b30 and to b35 .",
    "@xcite present photometric and spectroscopic studies of the young stellar population in the @xmath0 ori region .",
    "they suggested the ring - shaped molecular cloud to be caused by a supernova explosion that terminated recent star formation in the vicinity .",
    "it is likely that @xmath0 ori is the triggering source responsible for the star formation in b30 and b35 .",
    "it is found that photoevaporative flows @xcite stream out of the surfaces of them ; this is a demonstration of the interaction between a massive star and a molecular cloud ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lamori ] ) . here",
    "again we see that stars with forbidden lines , i.e. , stars 20 , 22 , and 44 in relation to b30 , and stars 25 and 26 to b35 , are all physically close to a brc .",
    "it is suggested that star formation is triggered by the o stars and/or by the superbubbles in ldn1616 @xcite and in ic2118 @xcite .",
    "all brcs in oriob1 which show evidence of star formation being triggered by nearby massive stars are found associated with strong @xmath1 100  @xmath2 and h@xmath3 emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lot1 ] ) . in every case a sequential process  that pms stars closer to the triggering stars are older than those closer to the brcs  can be clearly witnessed ( paper  i ) .",
    "the same phenomena are also seen near @xmath0 ori .",
    "initially , the b30 and b35 clouds might have extended toward @xmath0 ori , perhaps forming a barlike structure .",
    "the i - fronts from @xmath0 ori then propagated through the clouds , prompting star formation on both sides , thereby resulting in the lining up of the pms stars , in an age sequence , between @xmath0 ori and the b30 and b35 clouds .    in paper",
    "i we show that the cttss that are spatially close to brcs are among the brightest , just revealing themselves on the birthline and beginning to descend down the hayashi tracks .",
    "we also find no young stars far behind the i - fronts , i.e. , embedded in the brcs .",
    "these photoevaporated clouds typically have low extinction so that any pms stars can not have escaped the 2mass detection . in both oriob1 and the @xmath0 ori region",
    "therefore , we see the predomination of triggered star formation , as evinced in the cloud morphology , star grouping orientation , and star formation sequence .",
    "the lacob1 association , at a distance of @xmath16  pc @xcite , is one of the nearest ob associations .",
    "@xcite divides lacob1 into 2 subgroups ,  a \" and  b \" , on the basis of stellar proper motions and radial velocities .",
    "the entire lacob1 covers the region of the sky from @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "lacob1b occupies an area with a radius of @xmath19 centered around @xmath20 and lacob1a occupies the remaining area .",
    "the lacob1b harbors the only o star ( o9 v ) , 10lac , in the lacob1 association .",
    "our study discusses two regions in lacob1 known to have current star - forming activities , lbn437 and gal110 - 13 , a brc and a comet - shaped cloud , respectively .",
    "lbn437 is at the edge of an elongated molecular cloud @xcite and on the border of the region s126 excited by the nearby o star , 10lac .",
    "hereafter we call this elongated molecular cloud the  lac molecular cloud \" ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lac ] ) .",
    "between 10lac and lbn437 there is a small stellar group ( fig .",
    "[ fig : group ] ) which includes 5 cttss ( stars 3538 in table  3 , plus the ctts candidate 2massj22354224@xmath213959566 , for which we do not have spectroscopic observations ) and one haebe star ( star  53 in table  4 ) .",
    "the haebe star is an @xmath1 source , iras22343@xmath213944 .",
    "we can identify iras22343@xmath213944 as the counterpart of star  53 , because this star shows a near - infrared excess and is located within the positional error for iras22343@xmath213944 .",
    "hereafter we refer to this 6-star system as the iras22343@xmath213944 group ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lac ] ) .",
    "the size of the iras22343@xmath213944 group is about 24@xmath22 , which corresponds to @xmath23  pc at 360  pc .",
    "gal110@xmath2413 is an isolated and elongated molecular cloud ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gal ] ) at a distance of @xmath25  pc @xcite .",
    "its head - tail , comet - like shape suggests compression by ram - pressure , perhaps as a result of a recent cloud collision @xcite .",
    "star formation takes place on the compressed side of gal110@xmath2413 , e.g. , the location of the ctts star 40 ( bmand ) and the nebula vdb158 reflecting light from the b9.5v star hd222142 @xcite .",
    "in addition to hd222142 there are two other late b - type stars in the vicinity , hd222046 and hd222086 .",
    "all three b stars and star 40 share common proper motions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* data extracted from the second u.s .",
    "naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ) , which are consistent with those of the lacob1 groups @xcite , as summarized in table  7 .",
    "gal110@xmath2413 is located near the border of the lacob1 association , at a distance not very different from that of lacob1 .",
    "gal110@xmath2413 was not included as part of lacob1 by @xcite , but our analysis suggests that the cloud , together with the young stars associated with it , is likely part of lacob1a .",
    "gal110@xmath2413 is elongated and roughly points toward 10lac ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lac ] ) .",
    "this implies that lacob1b or 10lac alone is responsible for shaping the cloud .",
    "either shock fronts from a supernova or ionization fronts from a massive star could have caused the shape of this cloud as well as the spatial distribution of young stars in gal110@xmath2413 . in the supernova scenario a star in lacob1b more massive than 10lac exploded , and , assuming that lacob1b and 10lac are at the same distance from us ( i.e. , 358  pc ) , it would take a few hundred thousand years for the supernova shock waves ( at a speed of hundreds of km  s@xmath8 ) to propagate across the 126  pc separation to arrive , compress , and finally prompt the formation of stars within gal110@xmath2413 .",
    "additional evidence in support of this supernova scenario comes from the b5v star , hd201910 , which is supposed to be a runaway star kicked out from a binary system in lacob1b , when one of the component stars became a supernova @xcite .",
    "if this is so , the kinematic time scale of the star , 2.7  myr , suggests that a supernova explosion occurred some 2.7  myr ago and the associated shocks subsequently caused gal110@xmath2413 to develop its present cometary shape .",
    "an alternative explanation is due to compression by ionization fronts from a massive star , which would be a less destructive method for star formation than a supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "we propose a scenario in which 10lac  still in existence now  was born at the edge of the lac molecular cloud , similar to that presented in figure  [ fig : lac ] , but with the cloud originally being more extended toward 10lac . soon after its birth , 10lac ionized the surrounding molecular clouds , exposing itself to the intercloud medium . assuming that most of the uv photons of 10lac shortward of the lyman limit were used to ionize the intercloud medium , then given a typical intercloud material density @xmath26  @xmath27 @xcite",
    ", the i - fronts would travel the 126  pc distance from 10lac to gal110@xmath2413 in about 2  myr , a time scale still shorter than the main sequence life time of @xmath28  myr of 10lac @xcite .",
    "regardless of which scenario actually happened , a supernova shock front or an ionization front , lacob1b is likely responsible for the creation of gal110@xmath2413 and the associated stellar group .      in lbn437 ,",
    "star 52 ( v375lac ) is the only young star located at the edge of the lac molecular cloud , and interestingly there is no ctts or haebe candidate behind the interaction region . to check",
    "whether any pms stars could have escaped the 2mass detection limit of @xmath29  mag as a result of excessive dust extinction , we created the @xmath7 map of the lac molecular cloud @xcite ( as done for the brcs in oriob1 ; see paper  i ) .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath30-band luminosities of the embedded pms stars are the same as those of the visible pms stars outside the cloud , namely the iras22343@xmath213944 group .",
    "like other brcs we have analyzed the overall extinction in the lac molecular cloud is low , and the probability of nondetection is 0.014 .",
    "this means that there are indeed no embedded pms stars and hence no ongoing star formation in the lac molecular cloud .    the elongated lac molecular cloud associated with lbn437 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lac ] ) may be just the remnant of a molecular cloud , which was originally perhaps larger , extending as far as to 10lac . upon the birth of 10lac ,",
    "its energetic photons evaporated and compressed the cloud , shaping the cloud into a pillar , similar to the case of gal110@xmath2413 .",
    "the iras22343@xmath213944 group and star 52 were then born on the compressed side of the cloud .",
    "at least 3 stars in the iras22343@xmath213944 group exhibit forbidden lines , which is suggestive of their youth .",
    "star  52 is likely even younger because it is the exciting source of an hh outflow .",
    "apparently star 52 is the latest product in the star formation sequence by 10lac in this cloud .",
    "@xcite derived a 30% star formation efficiency for gal110@xmath2413 .",
    "this is much higher than that of the few percent typical in star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "extinction is low in gal110@xmath2413 , with an a@xmath31 less than 0.48  mag , as estimated from its @xmath7 values , so the cloud is insufficiently dense to hide from our detection any embedded young stars similar to star 40 . as in the case for oriob1",
    "( paper  i ) , the brcs in lacob1 also tend to have a relatively low dust extinction .",
    "such a low density condition is unfavorable for spontaneous , global cloud collapse .",
    "star formation however could take place at the interaction layer ( the bright rim ) of a molecular cloud .",
    "a stellar group could form , such as witnessed in the iras22343 + 3944 and gal110@xmath2413 groups .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derived the ages of lacob1a and lacob1b , on the basis of stellar proper motions and radial velocities : 1625  myr and 1216  myr , respectively .",
    "both these ages are too old to be consistent with the existence of 10lac ( with a lifetime of less than @xmath28  myr ) and the cttss ( typically aged a few myr ) in the region . thus lacob1a and lacob1b",
    "could not have formed at the same place and at the same time , because with a typical velocity dispersion of a few kilometers per second for an ob association @xcite , the two subgroups could not traverse the distance of 3080  pc now between them .",
    "we propose that both lacob1a and lacob1b are no more than a few myr old , and lacob1a is younger than lacob1b .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows the color - magnitude diagrams reconstructed from @xcite for the two subgroups .",
    "it can be seen that the stars in lacob1b form a clear main sequence , whereas those in the subgroup lacob1a are widely scattered to the right of the sequence . some stars in lacob1a",
    "may well still be in the pms phase , hence we postulate a younger age for lacob1a than for lacob1b .",
    "it is possible that lacob1b was formed first after which the expanding i - fronts from lacob1b triggered new generations of stars along the lac molecular cloud , the iras22343 + 3944 group and star 52 .",
    "a subsequent supernova or i - front then initiated the formation of stars in lacob1a ; eventually the  birth wave \" reached gal110@xmath2413 .",
    "triggered star formation has been suggested to have occurred close to regions @xcite .",
    "our study finds clear chronological and positional causality of such processes on larger scales . in @xmath0 ori , oriob1 and lacob1",
    ", we see supporting evidence of triggered star formation .",
    "the uv photons from an o star create expanding i - fronts which evaporate and compress nearby molecular clouds , thereby shaping the clouds into brcs or comet - shaped clouds .",
    "the next generation of stars can then form efficiently , perhaps in groups , out of the compressed material .",
    "the resulting newly formed stars would line up between the massive star and the molecular coulds in a formation and hence age sequence .",
    "stars at least as massive as late herbig be types could be formed via this process ( see table  4 ) .",
    "these stars would reach the main sequence with even earlier spectral types .",
    "triggered star formation could therefore produce not only low - mass stars , but also intermediate - mass or even massive stars . in our sample ,",
    "the haebe stars and cttss seem to be distributed spatially differently relative to a brc , in the sense that the cttss tend to be located near the surface of a brc , whereas the haebe stars appear preferentially to reside deeper into a brc(e.g . , star 44 in b30 , star 52 in lbn437 , and star 41 in ldn1616 ) .",
    "what we see in @xmath0 ori , oriob1 , and lacob1 is in contrast to the scenario proposed by @xcite and @xcite for which massive stars are formed in shocked cloud layers by triggering , whereas low - mass stars are formed spontaneously via cloud collapse and fragmentation .",
    "a global cloud collapse would lead to starbirth spreading throughout the cloud , but this was not observed in our study . instead",
    ", no young stars are found embedded in clouds far behind the i - fronts .",
    "more than mere  fossil \" molecular clouds , the brcs present convenient snapshots of how star formation must have proceeded in an ob association .",
    "when prompted to form , massive stars appear to favor denser environments where photoevaporation is relatively weak . in comparison ,",
    "when a dense molecular core near the ionization layer ( i.e. , current cloud surface ) collapses , the accretion process has to compete with the mass loss arising from photoevaporation , leading to the formation of less massive stars or even substellar objects @xcite .",
    "as the i - fronts progress , the remnant cloud is eventually dispersed , with stars of different masses remaining in the same volume .",
    "low- and intermediate - mass young stars in bright - rimmed or comet - shaped clouds on the border of an ob association are more likely to be formed by triggering . assuming a shock speed of @xmath32  km  s@xmath8",
    ", this would result in an age spread of several myrs between member stars or star groups formed in the sequence .",
    "if the velocities of the shocks are higher , as in the case of a supernova explosion , the age spreads would be less .",
    "we first selected cttss and haebe stars in @xmath0 ori , oriob1 , and lacob1 based on the 2mass colors .",
    "these pms stars are then utilized to trace recent star - forming activities .",
    "the young stars are found to be lined up in an age sequence between massive stars and comet - shaped clouds or bright - rimmed clouds , with the youngest stars located near the cloud surfaces .",
    "there are no pms stars far behind the i - fronts .",
    "these results support the scenario by which the lyman continuum photons of a luminous o star create expanding i - fronts that would cause the evaporation and compression of nearby clouds to form brcs or comet - shaped clouds , thereby inducing the birth of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the brcs provide us with a convenient setting in which to see that the haebe stars tend to form in the inner , denser parts of a cloud , whereas the cttss are formed near the photoevaporating cloud layers .",
    "young stars in bright - rimmed or comet - shaped clouds near a massive star are likely to have been formed by triggering . assuming a shock speed of @xmath32  km  s@xmath8",
    ", this would result in an age spread of several myrs between member stars or star groups formed in the sequence .",
    "we want to particularly thank richard f. green , director of kpno , who kindly provided us the director s discretionary time to accomplish this work .",
    "we are also grateful to the staff of the beijing astronomical observatory for their assistance during our observation runs and to the referee , hans zinnecker , for his suggestions helpful in improving the quality of this paper .",

    "<S> we find that the classical t tauri stars and herbig ae / be stars tend to line up between luminous o stars and bright - rimmed or comet - shaped clouds ; the closer to a cloud the progressively younger they are . </S>",
    "<S> our positional and chronological study lends support to the validity of the radiation - driven implosion mechanism , where the lyman continuum photons from a luminous o star create expanding ionization fronts to evaporate and compress nearby clouds into bright - rimmed or comet - shaped clouds . </S>",
    "<S> implosive pressure then causes dense clumps to collapse , prompting the formation of low - mass stars on the cloud surface ( i.e. , the bright rim ) and intermediate - mass stars somewhat deeper into the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> these stars are a signpost of current star formation ; no young stars are seen leading the ionization fronts further into the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> young stars in bright - rimmed or comet - shaped clouds are likely to have been formed by triggering , which would result in an age spread of several myrs between the member stars or star groups formed in the sequence . </S>"
