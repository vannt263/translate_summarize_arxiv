    "in the last decade , the measurements of fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) have shown a dramatic improvement marking the start of a new , data - rich era in cosmology ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the cmb power spectrum encodes information about the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , degeneracies exist between certain combinations of parameters which impose a limit on the precision attainable using cmb data alone . in order to break these degeneracies",
    "it is necessary to combine the cmb data with other datasets , such as the power spectrum of galaxy clustering .",
    "the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are the largest redshift surveys available and give the most detailed description of the large scale structure of the universe ( lss ) as traced by galaxies . a consistency check between these two datasets",
    "would test the hypothesis about the relation between the galaxy power spectrum and the linear perturbation theory prediction for the power spectrum of matter fluctuations .",
    "the constraints quoted in this work were obtained by snchez et  al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter s06 ) . in section  2 , we describe the data used in the parameter estimation . in section  3 ,",
    "we summarize the main results of s06 for the parameter constraints and perform a comparison with those obtained by spergel et  al .",
    "we also compare the results obtained using the 2dfgrs and sdss galaxy power spectra .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  4 .",
    "in order to constrain cosmological parameters , s06 used a compilation of recent measurements of the cmb , including the wmap first year data ( wmap1 ; hinshaw et  al .",
    "2003 ; kogut et  al .",
    "2003 ) , extended to smaller angular scales with information from acbar ( kuo et  al .",
    "2004 ) , vsa ( dickinson et  al .",
    "2004)and cbi ( readhead et  al .  2004 ) .",
    "these datasets were combined with the power spectrum of galaxy clustering measured from the final 2dfgrs catalogue by cole et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in order to model the effects of non - linearities and galaxy bias ,",
    "s06 followed the scheme developed by cole et  al . who applied a correction to the shape of @xmath3 of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the preferred values for the 2dfgrs and b is a constant bias factor .",
    "the power spectrum data was used for @xmath7 .",
    "s06 analysed a range of parameter sets and priors , allowing for massive neutrinos , curvature , tensors and general dark energy models .",
    "here we focus on the ` basic - six ' parameter space , defined by @xmath8 from which other parameters can be derived .",

    "the 2dfgrs @xmath3 helps to break this degeneracy , particularly by tightening the constraints on @xmath37 : ( @xmath38 for cmb data alone and @xmath39 for cmb plus 2dfgrs ) .",
    "when the cmb data is combined with the 2dfgrs @xmath3 , the recovered value of the spectral index of scalar perturbations is @xmath40 with @xmath41 at the @xmath42 confidence level , a deviation from scale invariance ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "the new wmap data represent a significant improvement over wmap1 due to the longer integration time and a better understanding of systematic effects .",
    "the new polarization data is particularly helpful in constraining @xmath21 , breaking some of the degeneracies present in the temperature data .",
    "the two sets of constraints are in remarcable agreement . in particular ,",

    "there is a clear discrepancy , however , with the results obtained using cmb data plus the sdss @xmath3 estimated by tegmark et  al .",
    "this difference can be traced back to the density of dark matter , with the sdss data pointing to higher values of @xmath44 .",
    "on considering the basic - six parameter space extended by the incorporation of the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath43 , we find @xmath45 using the sdss @xmath3 , which is much higher than the value @xmath46 obtained in the case of the 2dfgrs @xmath3 and inconsistent with a cosmological constant . again , this discrepancy is due to the preferred values of @xmath44 .",
    "[ fig : b6_w ] shows the degeneracy in the @xmath47 plane for cmb data alone . adding information from the galaxy power spectrum breaks this degeneracy . if the galaxy @xmath3 data prefer a high value of @xmath32 , as is the case for the sdss data , then a high value of @xmath43 will result",
    "we have reviewed the constraints on the values of the basic cosmological parameters obtained using a combination of cmb data and the galaxy power spectrum of the final 2dfgrs .",
    "the data shows clear evidence for a departure from a scale invariant primordial spectrum of scalar fluctuations ; the value @xmath1 is formally excluded at the @xmath42 confidence level .    a comparison with the results from spergel et al .",
    "( 2006 ) obtained using the data from the third year of flight of the wmap satellite shows an excellent agreement , which is a reassuring validation of the cosmological paradigm .",
    "in particular , the new results confirm the detection by s06 of a deviation from scale invariance with a higher statistical significance .",
    "there is an impressive agreement between the results obtained for cmb data alone and for cmb data plus the 2dfgrs power spectrum data .",
    "however , there is some tension between the constraints from the cmb and sdss datasets .",
    "cole , snchez and wilkins ( 2006 ) have shown that these differences are due to the @xmath48-band selected sdss catalogue being dominated by more strongly clustered red galaxies , which have a stronger scale dependent bias .",
    "it is therefore important to accurately model the distortion in the shape of the power spectrum caused by nonlinearity and scale dependent bias in order to obtain unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters from present and future galaxy surveys ."
