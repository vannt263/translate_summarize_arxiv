    "let @xmath1 be the elliptic curve defined by the equation @xmath2 , which is isomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "the case of @xmath4 is the curve  @xmath0 , and the cubefree positive @xmath5-values correspond to cubic twists .",
    "these equations have a long history , dating back to fermat .",
    "an early study was done by sylvester @xcite in 1879 - 80 , and another voluminous study in 1951 by selmer @xcite . in between these two ,",
    "nagell @xcite proved sundry results concerning non - solvability in many cases . in the late 1960s , stephens @xcite did numerical experiments with these curves with respect to the then - new birch  swinnerton - dyer conjecture .",
    "zagier and kramarz @xcite did a large numerical experiment in the  1980s , which led them to suggest that a positive proportion of the curves have rank 2 or greater .",
    "the best results in this regard appear to be due to mai @xcite , who showed that , assuming the parity conjecture , for every @xmath6 at least @xmath7 of the cubefree even twists up to @xmath8 have rank 2 .",
    "elkies and rogers @xcite have recently found that the curve @xmath9 has rank at least 11 .",
    "we shall mainly be concerned with rank 2 cubic twists and in extending the numerical data of @xcite , showing that the purported positive proportion does not seem to persist .",
    "we also consider questions of the distribution of the size of the tate ",
    "shafarevitch groups attached to these curves , comment on effects stemming from the arithmetic of  @xmath5 , consider similar questions for quartic twists of @xmath10 , and discuss random matrix models for these .",
    "we briefly review how to compute the central @xmath11-value of @xmath1 .",
    "the first consideration is the sign of the functional equation , which was computed by birch and stephens @xcite .",
    "this is defined by @xmath12 where for @xmath13 we have that @xmath14 if  @xmath15 and @xmath16 if @xmath17 does not divide  @xmath5 . for @xmath18 , we have that @xmath19 if @xmath20 ( mod  9 ) or @xmath21 , and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "next , there is the conductor @xmath23 where for @xmath13 we have that @xmath24 if @xmath15 and @xmath25 otherwise , while for @xmath18 we have that @xmath26 if @xmath27 , that @xmath28 if @xmath29 ( mod  9 ) , and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "there are also tamagawa numbers and considerations for the real period  @xmath31 ; the effects of these are given in the last section ( see also table  1 of  @xcite ) .    when @xmath32 , the central @xmath11-value is given by @xmath33 where the conductor  @xmath34 is defined as above , and the @xmath35 can be computed as follows . for primes @xmath36 ( mod  3 ) and primes  @xmath37 ,",
    "we define  @xmath38 .",
    "given a prime  @xmath39 ( mod  3 ) , the set @xmath40 has 3 elements .",
    "for such a prime we define @xmath41 to be the unique element in @xmath42 for which @xmath43 .",
    "we then define @xmath44 uniquely by the conditions @xmath45 ( mod  @xmath17 ) and @xmath46 ( this second condition is equivalent to @xmath47 for @xmath48 and not @xmath49 as @xcite  claims ) . having defined @xmath44 for all primes  @xmath17",
    ", we extend it to prime powers via the hecke relations , and then to all positive integers via multiplicativity . in order to approximate @xmath50",
    "well , we need to use about @xmath51 coefficients for some constant  @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath53 , the series for @xmath54 has the exponential function replaced by an exponential integral  we did not deal with this case ( @xcite  considered it for  @xmath55 ) since the exponential homomorphism can be computed rapidly more readily than the exponential integral  for the latter , local power series would likely be useful .",
    "lieman @xcite has shown that the values of @xmath50 are the coefficients of a metaplectic form as was suggested in  @xcite , but this does not seem useful for computational purposes .",
    "we did not try to use the conditions given by rodriguez villegas and zagier  @xcite , and can not comment on their computational efficacy .      applying the above method for the cubefree @xmath56 with @xmath32 , we find that about 17.7% of the twists have vanishing central @xmath11-value . this is to be compared to 23.3% for the @xmath57 , and 20.5% for @xmath58 . if we take the best linear fit to a log - log regression , we find that the number of twists up to @xmath59 with vanishing central @xmath11-value appears to grow like @xmath60 .",
    "heuristic models involving the expected size of @xmath61 as in @xcite imply that the growth should be more like @xmath62 . stronger models such as those in @xcite",
    "imply this should be more like @xmath63 for some constants @xmath64  and  @xmath52 ; in the last section we make remarks about what random matrix theory implies about  @xmath52",
    ".    there is also the question of arithmetic effects of  @xmath5 .",
    "only 6.1% of the prime  @xmath5 in the above range have vanishing central @xmath11-value , while 11.3% of the @xmath5 with two prime factors do , and 17.1% of the  @xmath5 with three prime factors .",
    "the number grows to 24.5% for four prime factors , and 35.3% for five prime factors , and is 51.4% for six or more prime factors .",
    "however , each of these percentages is about 20% lower than the comparative value when considering only the @xmath58 .",
    "so even if we restrict to prime  @xmath5 we expect that the proportion of twists with non - vanishing central @xmath11-value tends to zero .",
    "note in this context that 3-descent can tell us much about the rank when we limit the number of prime factors of  @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , when @xmath5 is prime and @xmath1 has even functional equation , we know that @xmath65 ( mod  9 ) , and the rank is zero in the latter two cases . thus the 6.1% of above might be re - interpreted as 18.3% of the cases where descent considerations do not force the rank to be zero . using the results of @xcite , we could similarly derive such results when @xmath5 has two prime factors . also , one can recall that elkies ( see @xcite ) has proven that the rank is exactly 1 for primes @xmath66 ( mod  9 ) ; here in fact the conjecture is that the same is true for @xmath67 ( mod  9 ) .",
    "we return to such considerations below when we discuss random matrix models .",
    "we next make some comments about how often various @xmath68-values occur .",
    "zagier and kramarz found that 26.3% of the even twists for @xmath57 have rank 0 and trivial @xmath61 , while we find the percentage to be 18.8% for @xmath58 and 14.1% for @xmath56 . indeed , already in @xcite this percentage",
    "was noted to be diminishing .",
    "more interesting might be how often a given prime divides  @xmath68 , under the restriction to rank 0 twists .",
    "for instance , 32.4% of the even rank 0 twists with @xmath57 have 3 dividing  @xmath68",
    ". this number increases to 40.1% for @xmath58 , and is 45.3% for @xmath56 .",
    "the heuristics of @xcite imply a number more like 36.1% .",
    "there is a strong arithmetic impact from  @xmath5 , as for prime  @xmath5 the percentage for @xmath56 is only 5.8% .",
    "however , this last datum should probably be considered anomalous because of the special role that 3 plays in the cubic twists .",
    "similarly , 2  divides @xmath68 about 45.7% of the time for even rank 0 twists with @xmath56 , while only 42.1% of the time for @xmath58 and 35.5% of the time for @xmath57 .",
    "here delaunay predicts 58.1% .",
    "here prime  @xmath5 are _ more _ likely to cause 2-divisibility of  @xmath68 , with the percentage here for being 53.5% . as @xcite notes ,",
    "the expectation is that @xmath68 should be of size @xmath69 for these cubic twists , larger than the expected @xmath70 in the general case . for 5-divisibility of  @xmath68 ,",
    "the percentage increases from 3.6% to 5.9% to 8.0% .",
    "it seems unlikely that these percentages ( for @xmath71 ) will climb all the way to  100% , and without a better guess , one could posit that they are tending toward the number suggested by the delaunay heuristic . in table",
    "[ tbl : first ] , the `` @xmath72 '' column counts percentages of curves for which the central @xmath11-value vanishes , while the other four columns denote how often a given prime divides the @xmath68-value of a nonvanishing twist ."
