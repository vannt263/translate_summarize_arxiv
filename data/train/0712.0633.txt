    "in trying to elucidate the role of quarks in hadrons and nuclei one steps immediately into the domain of relativistic quantum field theory where within the key phenomena can only be understood via nonperturbative methods .",
    "two prime examples are : confinement , the empirical fact that quarks have not hitherto been detected in isolation ; and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , which is responsible , amongst many other things , for the large mass splitting between parity partners in the spectrum of light - quark hadrons , even though the relevant current - quark masses are small .",
    "neither of these phenomena is apparent in qcd s lagrangian and yet they play a dominant role in determining the observable characteristics of real - world qcd .",
    "the physics of hadrons is ruled by such",
    "_ emergent phenomena_.",
    "in connection with confinement it is worth emphasising at the outset that the potential between infinitely - heavy quarks measured in numerical simulations of quenched lattice - regularised qcd  the so - called static potential  is simply not relevant to the question of light - quark confinement .",
    "in fact , it is quite likely a basic feature of qcd that a quantum mechanical potential between light - quarks is impossible to speak of because particle creation and annihilation effects are essentially nonperturbative .",
    "a perspective on confinement was laid out in ref.@xcite .",
    "expressed simply , confinement can be related to the analytic properties of qcd s schwinger functions , which are often loosely called euclidean - space green functions . for example",
    ", it can be read from the reconstruction theorem that the only schwinger functions which can be associated with expectation values in the hilbert space of observables ; namely , the set of measurable expectation values , are those that satisfy the axiom of reflection positivity @xcite .",
    "this is an extremely tight constraint .",
    "it can be shown to require as a necessary condition that the fourier transform of the momentum - space schwinger function is a positive - definite function of its arguments .",
    "however , that is not sufficient .    in relation",
    "to @xmath3-point schwinger functions , which are those connected with the propagators of elementary excitations in qcd , the axiom of reflection positivity is satisfied if , and only if , the schwinger function possesses a klln - lehmann representation .",
    "this statement is most easily illustrated for a scalar field , in which case it means that one can write the scalar - field s @xmath3-point function in the form , @xmath4 ; and @xmath5 . a timelike vector , @xmath6 , has @xmath7 .",
    "naturally , no theory consistent with causality can produce a schwinger function with a pole at spacelike @xmath8 . ]",
    "@xmath9 the spectral density for a non - interacting scalar field of mass @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "it is plain that no function @xmath12 which falls - off faster than @xmath13 at large spacelike momenta can be expressed in this way .",
    "an appreciation of the importance of the axiom associated with reflection positivity has led to the formulation of a _ confinement test _ @xcite . with a momentum - space schwinger function , @xmath14 , in hand , the first step is to calculate @xmath15 which gives the configuration - space schwinger function in the rest frame .",
    "one then examines the properties of @xmath16 .",
    "if an asymptotic state of mass @xmath10 is associated with this schwinger function , then @xmath17 i.e. , the schwinger function is positive definite and the mass of the asymptotic , propagating state is given by @xmath18 if , on the other hand , @xmath16 calculated from a particular schwinger function is not positive definite , then the axiom of reflection positivity is violated and the associated elementary excitation does not appear in the hilbert space of observables .",
    "thus the appearance of a least one zero in @xmath19 is a sufficient condition for confinement .",
    "it is a very clear signal .",
    "an exemplar is provided by @xmath20 a function for which with any particular choice of @xmath21 there exists a @xmath22 such that @xmath23 one has @xmath24 .",
    "one calculates from eq.([stingl ] ) : @xmath25.\\ ] ] this model was proposed in ref.@xcite and argued therein to describe a confined gluon because it does nt possess a pole on the real-@xmath8 axis .",
    "the argument for confinement is supported by the fact that @xmath16 is not positive definite and , indeed , exhibits damped oscillations about zero . hence the excitation associated with this schwinger function can not be connected with an expectation value in the hilbert space of observables .",
    "the existence of a zero in @xmath16 and its disappearance have been advocated as a means by which deconfinement can be studied in qcd at nonzero temperature and density @xcite .",
    "deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are coincident in all self - consistent studies of concrete models of qcd that exhibit both phenomena in vacuum .",
    "this result appears to follow from the crucial role played by the in - medium evolution of the dressed - quark self - energy in both transitions .",
    "further studies are needed to fully elucidate the nature and the probable simultaneity of these transitions in qcd .",
    "it was observed and emphasised in ref.@xcite that a violation of reflection positivity is a sufficient but _ not _ necessary condition for confinement .",
    "this criterion is nevertheless a powerful discriminating tool , as can be illustrated through a concrete example , which also serves to introduce the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) .",
    "the dses provide a nonperturbative approach in the continuum for calculating and modelling the properties of schwinger functions .",
    "they have long been used to develop insight into gauge field theories at both weak and strong coupling @xcite .    in connection with confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb )",
    "the dse for the dressed - quark propagator is of fundamental importance . in qcd",
    "this equation takes the form @xmath26 where at this point it is sufficient to work with the unrenormalised equation . in eq.([gendseur ] ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the dressed - gluon 2-point function ( propagator ) and dressed - quark - gluon 3-point function ( vertex ) ; and @xmath10 is a current - quark bare mass .",
    "finally , the subject of the equation , @xmath29 , is the dressed - quark propagator in vacuum .",
    "it can be written in a number of equivalent forms : @xmath30 each of which involves just two scalar functions . in the last representation they are chosen to be the wave function renormalisation , @xmath31 , and the running mass function , @xmath32 .",
    "reference  @xcite introduced a simple _ ansatz _ for the kernel of eq.([gendseur ] ) ; namely , @xmath33,\\ ; \\gamma^a_\\nu(q , p ) = \\frac{\\lambda^a}{2}\\gamma_\\nu\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a mass@xmath35-scale .",
    "the ladder quark - antiquark interaction represented by eqs.([mnprop ] ) is a constant in configuration space .",
    "therefore the usual proof of the cluster decomposition property fails and hence this _ ansatz _ defines a confining model .",
    "furthermore , with @xmath36 , eqs.([gendseur ] ) and ( [ mnprop ] ) yield the following solution : @xmath37 when eq.([deltatau ] ) is evaluated with @xmath38 constructed from eqs.([abmnres ] ) , one obtains @xmath39 i.e. , a function with repeated zeros .",
    "thus the interaction s violation of the cluster decomposition property is expressed in a fermion propagator that fails to satisfy the axiom of reflection positivity .",
    "hence it describes a confined elementary excitation .",
    "the story continues in a fascinating manner when one dresses the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "studies attempting to elucidate the nature of @xmath40 are now underway using both continuum @xcite and lattice - qcd techniques @xcite . however , this is a relatively recent development .",
    "it was and remains common to employ an _",
    "ansatz _ for this 3-point schwinger function that is constructed according to lessons learnt by studying ward - takahashi identities in gauge field theories @xcite .",
    "one often used form is based on the vertex introduced in ref.@xcite ; viz .",
    ", do not change the results which follow .",
    "the influence of more significant changes ; for example , introducing a dependence on functions other than those which appear in the quark propagator , must be explored on a case - by - case basis .",
    "it is a simple truth that all we have at present are _ anstze _ for the vertex and no modification will alter a simple , long established fact , soon to become apparent : the vertex can have a material impact on the expression of confinement and dcsb in qcd . ]",
    "@xmath41 , with @xmath42 \\!,\\\\",

    "moreover , when eq.([deltatau ] ) is evaluated with @xmath38 constructed from eqs.([vsmnres ] ) , one obtains @xmath47 in contrast to eq.([dabmn ] ) , this is positive definite .",
    "however , it yields an effective mass via eq.([massdelta ] ) : @xmath48 and infinitely massive states _ can not _ propagate .",
    "these observations notwithstanding , confinement of the quark represented by the propagator in eq.([vsmnres ] ) is still signalled by a violation of the reflection positivity axiom .",
    "it is clear from the momentum space form of the propagator that the axiom is breached because both @xmath46 fall faster than @xmath13 at large spacelike @xmath8 .",
    "however , it can also be seen in another way , which is indispensable if the momentum - space form of the schwinger function is not known .",
    "one can evaluate eq.([deltatau ] ) with eq.([klrep ] ) to obtain @xmath49 reflection positivity is satisfied by a configuration - space schwinger function if , and only if , it can be expressed in this form , with @xmath50 as described in eq.([klrep ] ) .",
    "now the theorem of ref.@xcite can be employed to show that the function in eq.([dgt2 ] ) can not be represented in this way and therefore contravenes the axiom .",
    "it is a fact that no function which falls faster than @xmath51 at large @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is some constant , can be expressed through eq.([widder ] ) . amongst other things",
    ", it follows that an excitation described by an effective mass , @xmath54 , which grows with euclidean separation is necessarily absent from the spectrum of physical states because its schwinger function violates the axiom of reflection positivity .",
    "this is a novel perspective .    with the information provided above one",
    "can identify a confined excitation ; and hence , in the context of qcd , these tools have been employed to analyse propagators obtained both as solutions of truncated systems of dses and through numerical simulations of lattice - regularised qcd .",
    "extant analyses , e.g. , ref.@xcite , suggest strongly that the gluon @xmath3-point function in qcd is not reflection positive . the same has been argued for the dressed - quark propagator in qcd , e.g. , ref.@xcite . however , as noted above , the detailed structure of the dressed - quark - gluon vertex is unknown and it can influence the analytic properties of @xmath29 .",
    "hence a firm conclusion on the dressed - quark propagator has not yet been reached ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .    in relation to the studies just mentioned",
    ", it is noteworthy that any @xmath3-point schwinger function with an inflexion point at @xmath55 must breach the axiom of reflection positivity .",
    "this can be seen directly from eq.([klrep ] ) , which constrains the first derivative of reflection positive functions to be negative definite and the second derivative to be positive definite .",
    "hence , it is often unnecessary to actually calculate the fourier transform described in eq.([deltatau ] )",
    ". a violation of reflection positivity can be determined by inspection of the pointwise behaviour of the momentum space schwinger function .",
    "it should now be clear that we have a means of identifying whether or not a given schwinger function can be associated with an expectation value in the hilbert space of observables . in principle",
    ", one could calculate all qcd s schwinger functions and demonstrate confinement of colour therewith .",
    "plainly , however , that will be difficult in practice and nigh on impossible by brute force .",
    "a proof of confinement at some higher organisational level is necessary , and sought by many .",
    "there is a surviving hope that the study of gauge theories in less than four dimensions might be useful in this regard .",
    "analogous to quenched qcd , quenched qed in three dimensions ( two spacial , one temporal ",
    "qed@xmath56 ) is confining because it has a nonzero string tension @xcite .",
    "the effect of unquenching ; viz . , allowing light fermions to influence the theory s dynamics , remains an important but unresolved question .",
    "it is conceivable that through its answer we might inform ourselves about aspects of the confinement problem in qcd .",
    "the early history of qed@xmath56 studies is reviewed in ref.@xcite and their current status can be traced from ref.@xcite .    in closing this section",
    "it is important to reiterate that confinement is a conjecture .",
    "in order to establish confinement as more than a contemporary empirical fact , it will be necessary to map out the nonperturbative structure of qcd s @xmath57-function .- function . for a detailed discussion , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite . ] in order to accomplish that , one will need to determine the nonperturbative evolution of the renormalisation constants .",
    "that is tantamount to establishing rigorously that the theory exists .",
    "this fact emphasises the magnitude of the problem .",
    "absent this , progress in hadron physics can still be made with well - constrained models that express key consequences of confinement .",
    "the feedback that this enables between experiment and theory further illuminates the essence of the confinement conjecture in relation to light - quarks .",
    "this can begin with the development and employment of a poincar covariant framework that ensures the colour - singlet @xmath58-matrix elements associated with physical processes do not possess production thresholds for light - quarks , in particular , and coloured elementary excitations in general .",
    "the notions described above have been immensely valuable in this regard . for example , they underly the dse model introduced in ref.@xcite , which has served as an archetype for numerous efficacious applications , as can be seen , e.g. , from refs.@xcite .",
    "many statements of fact can be made in connection with this emergent phenomenon .",
    "for example , dcsb explains the origin of constituent - quark masses and underlies the success of chiral effective field theory .",
    "understanding dcsb within qcd proceeds from the renormalised gap equation @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents a poincar invariant regularisation of the integral , with @xmath61 the regularisation mass - scale , @xmath27 is the renormalised dressed - gluon propagator , @xmath62 is the renormalised dressed - quark - gluon vertex , and @xmath63 is the quark s @xmath61-dependent bare current - mass .",
    "the vertex and quark wave - function renormalisation constants , @xmath64 , depend on the gauge parameter .",
    "the form of the solution to eq.([gendse ] ) is the same as that written in eq.([spab ] ) _ except _ that in qcd one must account for the renormalisation point dependence : @xmath65 it is important that the mass function , @xmath66 , illustrated in fig.[gluoncloud ] , is independent of the renormalisation point , @xmath67 . the dressed propagator is obtained from eq.([gendse ] ) augmented by the renormalisation condition . ]",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 is the running mass : @xmath70 with @xmath71 the lagrangian - mass renormalisation constant . in qcd the chiral limit",
    "is strictly defined by @xcite : @xmath72 which states that the renormalisation - point - invariant current - quark mass @xmath73 .    in perturbation",
    "theory it is impossible in the chiral limit to obtain @xmath74 : the generation of mass _ from nothing _ is an essentially nonperturbative phenomenon . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a longstanding prediction of nonperturbative dse studies that dcsb will occur so long as the integrated infrared strength possessed by the gap equation s kernel exceeds some critical value @xcite .",
    "there are strong indications that this condition is satisfied in qcd @xcite ( see fig.[gluoncloud ] ) .",
    "it follows that the quark - parton of qcd acquires a momentum - dependent mass function , which at infrared momenta is @xmath75-times larger than the current - quark mass .",
    "this effect owes primarily to a dense cloud of gluons that clothes a low - momentum quark @xcite .",
    "it means that the higgs mechanism is largely irrelevant to the bulk of normal matter in the universe .",
    "instead the single most important mass generating mechanism for light - quark hadrons is the strong interaction effect of dcsb ; e.g. , one can identify it as being responsible for 98% of a proton s mass .",
    "the vacuum quark condensate is the order parameter most commonly cited in connection with dcsb .",
    "for example , it occurs as a parameter at leading order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "it is a basic fact that only in the chiral limit is it possible to unambiguously define the gauge invariant vacuum quark condensate in terms of @xmath29 @xcite . that such a definition is possible at all emphasises that gauge covariant quantities contain gauge invariant information",
    "notwithstanding these truths , @xmath32 is a more fundamental tracer for dcsb .",
    "the condensate is only a small part of the information that the mass function contains , amongst other pieces are pointwise consequences of goldstone s theorem @xcite , definitions and an explanation of the constituent - quark mass @xcite , and a related @xmath76-term @xcite .- term and the massive - quark condensate defined unambiguously in ref.@xcite demonstrate that the essentially dynamical component of chiral symmetry breaking decreases with increasing current - quark mass .",
    "this is an important observation that is basic , e.g. , to the validity of heavy - quark effective theory . ]",
    "harking back to sect.[sect : conf ] , it is interesting to note that considered as a function of current - quark mass the dressed - quark propagator possesses a spectral representation @xcite , confinement and dcsb notwithstanding .    that a nonzero quark mass function is generated in massless qcd",
    "entails that chiral symmetry is realised in the nambu - goldstone mode and the vacuum quark condensate is nonzero .",
    "the magnitude of the mass function in the infrared and order parameters contingent thereupon underly the validity of chiral effective theory as a tool for correlating low - energy observables in qcd . the question of whether @xmath32 has an expansion in current - quark mass around its chiral - limit value bears upon the radius of convergence for that perturbation theory .",
    "this question asks whether it is possible to write @xmath77 on a measurable domain of current - quark mass .",
    "it was found @xcite that such an expansion exists for @xmath78 and is absolutely convergent .",
    "the value of @xmath79 can be reported as follows : is never within the domain of absolute convergence . ] for a pion - like meson constituted from a quark , @xmath80 , with mass @xmath79 and an equal - mass but different flavor antiquark , @xmath81 , @xmath82gev . since physical observables , such as the leptonic decay constant ,",
    "are expressed via @xmath32 , it follows that a chiral expansion is meaningful only for @xmath83gev@xmath35 .",
    "hence , it is only valid to employ chiral perturbation theory to fit and extrapolate results from numerical simulations of lattice - regularized qcd when the simulation parameters provide for @xmath84gev@xmath35 .",
    "lattice results at larger pion masses are not within the domain of convergence of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is a fact in qcd and this amplifies the importance of the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity .",
    "the existence of a sensible truncation of the dses @xcite has enabled proof via that identity of a body of exact results for pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "they relate even to radial excitations and/or hybrids @xcite , and heavy - light @xcite and heavy - heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "the results have been illustrated using a renormalisation - group - improved rainbow - ladder truncation @xcite , which also provided a prediction of the electromagnetic pion form factor @xcite .",
    "in addition , algebraic parametrisations of the dressed - quark propagators and meson bound - state amplitudes obtained from such studies continue to be useful .",
    "one example is a recent application to @xmath85-meson @xmath86 light - meson transition form - factors @xcite , the results of which can be useful in the analysis and correlation of the large body of data being accumulated at extant heavy - quark facilities , and thereby in probing the standard model .",
    "implications for neutral pseudoscalar mesons have been elucidated @xcite . in the general case",
    "the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity is written @xmath87 wherein : @xmath88 are the generators of @xmath89 ; the dressed - quark propagator @xmath90diag@xmath91 $ ] is matrix - valued ; @xmath92 is the matrix of renormalised ( running ) current - quark masses and @xmath93,$ ] where the trace is over flavour indices .",
    "the inhomogeneous axial - vector vertex in eq.([avwti ] ) satisfies a bethe - salpeter equation ; viz . , @xmath94_{tu } =   z_2 \\left[\\gamma_5\\gamma_\\mu { \\cal f}^a \\right]_{tu}+ \\int^\\lambda_q [ { \\cal s}(q_+ ) \\gamma^a_{5\\mu}(q;p ) { \\cal s}(q_-)]_{sr } k_{tu}^{rs}(q , k;p)\\ , , \\label{avbse}\\ ] ]",

    "the pseudoscalar vertex @xmath102 satisfies an analogous equation driven by the inhomogeneity @xmath103 .    the final term in eq.([avwti ] )",
    "expresses the non - abelian axial anomaly .",
    "it involves @xmath104 wherein the matrix element represents an operator expectation value in full qcd and @xmath105 is the topological charge density operator , with @xmath106 the gluon field strength tensor .",

    "it is the chiral limit that is being discussed , in which case @xmath118 if , and only if , chiral symmetry is dynamically broken .",

    "reference@xcite derives a range of corollaries , amongst which are mass formulae for neutral pseudoscalar mesons .",

    "the use of dses to study meson phenomena is empowered by the existence noted above of a systematic , nonperturbative and symmetry - preserving truncation scheme @xcite .",

    "the last three columns describe systems with so - called exotic quantum numbers . of course , these states are exotic only in the context of the naive constituent quark model . in qcd",
    "they correspond simply to interpolating fields with some gluon content and are easily accessible via the bse @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , while the rainbow - ladder truncation binds in these channels , the shortcomings encountered in the @xmath151 channels are also evident here , for many of the same reasons . reliable predictions for the masses of such states will only be obtained once improved kernels are developed . at the very least",
    ", one must have dependable predictions for axial - vector masses before drawing any conclusions about the so - called exotics . since all these states lie within a domain",
    "on which dcsb is very relevant , a framework with a veracious description of that emergent phenomenon is essential .",
    "one might pose the question of whether , in the context of bound - state studies in which model assumptions are made regarding the nature of the long - range interaction between light quarks , anything is gained by working solely with schwinger functions .",
    "this means , in part , constraining oneself to work only with information obtained from the dses at spacelike momenta .",
    "according to a recent study @xcite the answer is no .",
    "it analysed the capacity of schwinger functions to yield information about bound states , and established that for the ground state in a given channel the mass and residue are accessible via rudimentary methods .",
    "however , simple methods can not provide dependable information about more massive states in a given channel .",
    "indeed , there is no easy way to extract such information .",
    "an approach based on a correlator matrix can be successful but only if the operators are carefully constructed so as to have large overlap with states of interest in a given channel , and statistical and systematic errors can be made small ; viz . , @xmath152% . while it is possible in principle to satisfy these constraints",
    ", doing so is labor intensive and time consuming .",
    "that is only justified in the absence of model - dependence .",
    "partly because attention to this sector has only recently increased , the current level of expertise in studying baryons is roughly the same as it was with mesons more than ten years ago ; viz . , model building and phenomenology .",
    "we are a little ahead of that game , however , because much has been learnt in meson applications ; e.g. , as indicated above , a veracious understanding of the structure of dressed - quarks and -gluons has been acquired .      in quantum field theory",
    "a nucleon appears as a pole in a six - point quark green function .",
    "the pole s residue is proportional to the nucleon s faddeev amplitude , which is obtained from a poincar covariant faddeev equation that adds - up all possible quantum field theoretical exchanges and interactions that can take place between three dressed - quarks .",
    "this is important because modern , high - luminosity experimental facilities employ large momentum transfer reactions ; viz .",
    ", @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the nucleon s mass , and hence a veracious understanding of contemporary data requires a poincar covariant description of the nucleon .",
    "a tractable truncation of the faddeev equation is based @xcite on the observation that an interaction which describes mesons also generates diquark correlations in the colour-@xmath155 channel @xcite .",
    "the dominant correlations for ground state octet and decuplet baryons are @xmath156 and @xmath157 diquarks because , e.g. : the associated mass - scales are smaller than the baryons masses @xcite , namely ( in gev )  @xmath158_{0^+ } } = 0.7 - 0.8   \\,,\\ ;   m_{(uu)_{1^+}}=m_{(ud)_{1^+}}=m_{(dd)_{1^+}}=0.9 - 1.0\\,;\\ ] ] and the electromagnetic size of these correlations , while larger than the pion , is less than that of the proton @xcite  @xmath159_{0^+ } } \\approx 0.7\\,{\\rm fm}\\,,\\ ; r_{(ud)_{1^+ } } \\sim 0.8\\,{\\rm fm}\\,.\\ ] ] the last result is an estimate based on the @xmath160-meson/@xmath161-meson radius - ratio @xcite .",
    "the faddeev equation s kernel is completed by specifying that the quarks are dressed , with two of the three dressed - quarks correlated always as a colour-@xmath155 diquark . binding is then effected by the iterated exchange of roles between the bystander and diquark - participant quarks .",
    "a ward - takahashi - identity - preserving electromagnetic current for the baryon thus constituted is subsequently derived  @xcite .",
    "it depends on the electromagnetic properties of the axial - vector diquark correlation .",
    "a study of the nucleon s mass and the effect on this of a pseudoscalar meson cloud are detailed in @xcite .",
    "lessons learnt were employed in a series of studies of nucleon properties , including form factors @xcite .",
    "the calculated ratio @xmath162 passes through zero at @xmath163gev@xmath35 @xcite . for the neutron , in the neighbourhood of @xmath164 , @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the neutron s electric radius @xcite .",
    "the evolution of @xmath162 and @xmath167 on @xmath168gev@xmath35 are both primarily determined by the quark - core of the nucleon .",
    "while the proton ratio decreases uniformly on this domain @xcite , the neutron ratio increases steadily until @xmath169gev@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a form factor ratio motivated by ideas from perturbative qcd @xcite is depicted in fig.[nf2f1 ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 is interpreted as a mass - scale that defines the upper - bound on the domain of so - called soft momenta in the perturbative analysis .",
    "a plausible value for such a quantity is @xmath170 @xcite.gev corresponds to a length - scale @xmath171fm .",
    "it is not credible that perturbative qcd is applicable at ranges greater than the proton s radius .",
    "a reasonable value is @xmath172gev , leading to @xmath173fm . ]",
    "it is interesting that the model of ref.@xcite yields neutron and proton ratios which cross at @xmath174gev@xmath35 .",
    "the model s prediction for truly asymptotic momenta is currently being explored .",
    "it is plausible that nature s fundamental `` constants '' might actually exhibit spatial and temporal variation @xcite .",
    "this motivates an exploration of the current - quark - mass - dependence of the nucleon magnetic moments , which complements work on hadron @xmath76-terms @xcite .",
    "preliminary results for the quark - core contribution to this variation can be expressed through the following ratios evaluated at the physical current - quark mass @xcite : @xmath175 it is likely that pseudoscalar meson contributions will increase these values by a factor of @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "the framework can naturally be applied to calculate weak and strong form factors of the nucleon .",
    "preliminary studies of this type are reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "such form factors are sensitive to different aspects of quark - nuclear physics and should prove useful , e.g. , in constraining coupled - channel models for medium - energy production reactions on the nucleon .",
    "this is important to the search for the so - called missing nucleon resonances ) , which are predicted by the @xmath177 constituent quark model ( @xmath178 ) , are not seen in the baryon spectrum that is obtained from amplitude analyses of @xmath179 elastic scattering . at this time more than half of",
    "the low - lying states predicted by @xmath178 are missing @xcite . ] and the related problem of identifying exotic baryons .",
    "of significant interest is the distribution of an hadron s _ spin _ over the quark constituents and their angular momentum . in a poincar covariant approach that can be calculated in any frame .",
    "the rest frame is physically most natural .",
    "the pion was considered in ref.@xcite and although @xmath180 the dressed - quarks carry significant orbital angular momentum .",

    "two are associated with the @xmath156 diquark correlation : @xmath184 , and six with the @xmath157 correlation : @xmath185 . in the rest frame in this basis one can derive the following `` good '' angular momentum and spin assignments , which add vectorially to give a @xmath186 nucleon : ) herein describes the correct assignments . ]",

    "\\end{array } \\label{ls}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these assignments are straightforward to demonstrate and understand ; e.g , in the rest frame of a relativistic constituent quark model the @xmath184 terms correspond , respectively , to the upper and lower components of the nucleon s spinor .    to exhibit the importance of the various @xmath188-@xmath58 correlations within the nucleon s faddeev wave - function , ref.@xcite reported the breakdown of contributions to the nucleon s canonical normalisation : indicates the integrated contribution associated with @xmath189 .",
    "the entries are reweighted such that the sum of the squares of the entries equals one .",
    "positions without an entry are zero to two decimal places . ]",
    "@xmath190 to illustrate how eq.([lsresult ] ) should be understood , note that the largest single entry is associated with @xmath191 , which represents the quark outside the scalar diquark correlation carrying all the nucleon s spin .",
    "that is the @xmath100-quark in the proton .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that a contribution of similar magnitude is associated with the axial - vector diquark correlations , which express mixing between @xmath192- and @xmath193-waves ; viz . , @xmath194 .",
    "with @xmath195 all quark spins are aligned with that of the nucleon and the unit of angular momentum is opposed : @xmath196 , while with @xmath197 all quark spins are opposed and the two units of angular momentum are aligned : @xmath198 . this contribution is more important than those associated with @xmath199 ; namely , scalar diquark terms with the bystander quark s spin antiparallel .",
    "finally , for the present , in this context one single number is perhaps most telling : the contribution to the normalisation from @xmath200 terms is only 37% of the total .",
    "the basic problem of hadron physics is to solve qcd . in order to achieve this goal a joint effort from experiment and theory",
    "is required .",
    "our community now has a range of major facilities that are accumulating data , of unprecedented accuracy and precision , which pose important challenges for theory .",
    "it is the feedback between experiment and theory that leads most rapidly to progress in understanding . the opportunities for hadron physics will grow because upgraded and new facilities will appear on a five - to - ten - year time - scale .",
    "this volume provides an excellent illustration of the splendid experimental accomplishments of recent times , the achievements of theory in explaining and interpreting the observations , and some of the urgent open problems .",
    "two of the things that stand out are the diversity of theoretical approaches and the interplay between them that is necessary to draw valid conclusions from contemporary data .",
    "one need not think too hard in order to list a number of the key open problems .",
    "it is essential to understand the origin and the nature of confinement .",
    "asymptotic coloured states have not hitherto been observed , but is it a cardinal fact that they can not ?",
    "as described herein , confinement is related to the analytic structure of elementary n - point functions in qcd and especially to their properties at infrared momenta .",
    "is it in the essence of non - abelian gauge theories that they possess an hilbert space of physical states that is reconstructed from only a small subset of all the theory s schwinger functions ? in progressing toward an answer to the question of confinement",
    "it will be necessary to map out the infrared behaviour of qcd s @xmath57-function .",
    "the upgraded and future facilities will provide data which will guide that process .",
    "however , to make full use of that data , it will be necessary to have reliable poincar covariant theoretical tools which enable the study of hadrons in the mass range @xmath201-@xmath202gev .",
    "on this domain confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking are both germane .",
    "it is known that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) ; namely , the generation of mass _ from nothing _ , does take place in qcd .",
    "however , the origin of the interaction strength at infrared momenta that guarantees dcsb through the gap equation is unknown .",
    "this ties confinement to dcsb .",
    "further to this connection , at nonzero temperature and chemical potential are the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration transitions simultaneous ?",
    "if so , why , under what conditions , and also , perhaps , in which class of theories ?",
    "it is important to understand the relationship between parton properties on the light - front and the rest frame structure of hadrons .",
    "this is a problem because , e.g. , dcsb , an established keystone of low - energy qcd , has not been realised in the light - front formulation .",
    "the obstacle is the constraint @xmath203 for massive quanta on the light front @xcite .",
    "it is therefore impossible to make zero momentum fock states that contain particles and hence the vacuum is trivial . only the zero modes of light - front quantisation can dress the ground state but little progress has been made with understanding just how that might occur .",
    "furthermore , parton distribution functions must be calculated in order to comprehend their content .",
    "parametrisation is insufficient .",
    "it would be very interesting to know , e.g. , how , if at all , the distribution functions of a goldstone mode differ from those of other hadrons . calculation @xcite and experiment @xcite together are needed to address that issue .    a last question in this brief survey , but certainly not the least ,",
    "how do the properties of hadrons change within nuclei , and within very dense systems ? absent an answer to this , one is not addressing the subject of nuclear physics .",
    "the experimental archetype for this problem is the emc effect .",
    "experiments have shown that in - nucleus parton distribution functions can not simply be obtained by adding together the distributions within the constituent nucleons .",
    "a satisfactory understanding of this effect is still lacking , almost twenty - five years after its discovery . within",
    "this theme one also asks for information on : the equation of state for dense matter ; the properties of the hadron to quark - gluon phase transition ; and the evolution between and nature of the states of matter within compact astrophysical objects .",
    "plainly , in addressing this question one is embarking on a far reaching quest .",
    "there is ample evidence of the constructive feedback between theoretical approaches .",
    "for example , dyson - schwinger equation studies and effective field theory inform calculations within lattice - regularised qcd , and this interplay will become increasingly powerful as the parameters of lattice - qcd simulations come closer to the physical domain .",
    "notwithstanding the investment in and progress that has been made with lattice - regularised qcd , for example , there is a pressing present and continuing need for model building and application in hadron physics .",
    "no single so - called _",
    "ab - initio _ approach is currently applicable to all the phenomena attributed to qcd at all the length - scales that can be explored .",
    "therefore , understanding and synthesising the wealth of extant and forthcoming data requires the continued development of models .",
    "such tools answer an immediate need and provide a ready means to develop intuition about a complex system .",
    "naturally , a reasonable model should obey all relevant constraints that _ ab - initio _ approaches and symmetries apply .",
    "that being so , it can then provide a rational and flexible guide in connection with our rapidly changing experimental environment .",
    "continued investment in each of the nonperturbative tools that might provide insight into qcd is also necessary .",
    "perturbative qcd is understood but its application begs a key question : at just which scale does its employment become valid ?",
    "the answer can only be attained nonperturbatively .",
    "a number of experiments are described as exhibiting precocious scaling ; i.e. , they are associated with cross - sections that appear to evolve with momentum according to perturbative qcd expectations .",
    "however , only a comprehensive nonperturbative analysis can explain whether that is the result of an accidental cancellation over the  often small  momentum domain accessible to the experiment or a clear signal of perturbative qcd .",
    "partial answers to this and related questions are possible through internally consistent model calculations that can unify many observables , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "but a complete answer will require truly nonperturbative calculations of the scale - dependence of observables within a framework that is able to exhibit the perturbative qcd limit , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "this contribution has outlined the utilisation of dses in studying some of the many facets of the basic problem of hadron physics .",
    "the dses provide a natural framework within which light - quark confinement can be defined , and the origin and consequences of dcsb explored . to build an understanding of confinement , it is essential to work toward an accurate map of the interaction between light - quarks . among the rewards",
    "are a precise connection between confinement and dcsb , an accounting of the distribution of mass within hadrons , and a realistic picture of hybrids and exotics",
    ". it can not be too strongly emphasised that dcsb is remarkably effective at generating mass . for light - quarks",
    "it is far more important than the higgs mechanism .",
    "it is understood via qcd s gap equation , which delivers a quark mass function with a momentum - dependence that connects the perturbative domain with the nonperturbative , constituent - quark domain .",
    "the existence of a sensible truncation scheme enables the proof of exact results using the dses .",
    "the scheme is also tractable , and hence the results can be illustrated and predictions made for observables .",
    "the consequent opportunities for rapid feedback between experiment and theory provide openings through which an intuitive understanding of numerous nonperturbative strong interaction phenomena can be reached via the dses .",

    "<S> an overview of the theory and phenomenology of hadrons and qcd is provided from a dyson - schwinger equation viewpoint . following a discussion of the definition and realisation of light - quark confinement , </S>",
    "<S> the nonperturbative nature of the running mass in qcd and inferences from the gap equation relating to the radius of convergence for expansions of observables in the current - quark mass are described . some exact results for pseudoscalar mesons </S>",
    "<S> are also highlighted , with details relating to the @xmath0 problem , and calculated masses of the lightest @xmath1 states are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> studies of nucleon properties are recapitulated upon and illustrated : through a comparison of the @xmath2-weighted ratios of pauli and dirac form factors for the neutron and proton ; and a perspective on the contribution of quark orbital angular momentum to the spin of a nucleon at rest . </S>",
    "<S> comments on prospects for the future of the study of quarks in hadrons and nuclei round out the contribution . </S>"
