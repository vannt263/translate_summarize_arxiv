    "recent detailed dalitz plot analyzes for different @xmath8 decays were performed by babar and belle collaborations @xcite .",
    "new and rich data on @xmath9 effective mass ( @xmath10 ) and helicity angle distributions , branching fractions and cp asymmetries have been delivered .",
    "the effective mass distributions show distinct accumulation of events below 2 gev around the scalar @xmath6 and the vector @xmath11 resonances . in experimental",
    "analyzes the event distributions have been studied using the isobar model with decay amplitudes parameterized by sums of breit - wigner terms and a background . in @xcite an effective range component has been introduced in the @xmath9 @xmath4-wave amplitude . in this short report",
    "we present main results of our work on @xmath12 decays into three mesons , @xmath13 , with final state interactions between kaons and pions in the @xmath4- and @xmath5-waves @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we restrict ourselves to the low effective @xmath9 mass region @xmath14 gev where most of the @xmath9 resonant structures are seen .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that in such a kinematical configuration three - body interactions are suppressed .",
    "this allows us to grant the validity of quasi two - body factorization approach .",
    "we also assume that the @xmath3 pairs originate from a quark - antiquark state .",
    "main assumption in our approach is , however , that the corrections to factorization can be absorbed into @xmath10 independent modifications of the qcd wilson coefficients .",
    "we take parts of these corrections from quasi - two - body calculations and append a phenomenological part .    in the factorization approach",
    "the decay amplitudes can be expressed as a product of the effective qcd part and the two matrix elements of the vector currents which involve two functions of @xmath15 : the strange scalar and the vector form factors .",
    "the introduction of form factors , constrained by theory and experiments other than @xmath12 decays , is an alternative to the isobar model often used in experimental analyzes .",
    "this latter approximation violates unitarity what can , for example , lead to a distortion of information on resonances present in the final states .",
    "the weak amplitudes for the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays , have one term derived in the qcd factorization , and the second one being a phenomenological contribution to the penguin amplitudes .",
    "for example , the @xmath3 @xmath4-wave contribution to the @xmath19 decay amplitude reads ( expressions for other @xmath12 decay amplitudes can be found in @xcite ) : @xmath20\\bigg\\ } ,   \\ ] ] where the @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are the leading order factorization coefficients with @xmath23 vertex and penguin corrections added in the quasi - two - body approximation of pseudoscalar - scalar or pseudoscalar - vector final states .",
    "the @xmath24 coefficients are additional phenomenological complex parameters fitted to the experimental data .",
    "they can be interpreted as contributions from charming penguins , hard spectator interaction in the perturbative regime and as annihilation terms .",
    "@xmath25 denotes the fermi coupling constant , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the masses of the charged @xmath12 mesons , kaons and pions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the @xmath30 to @xmath31 and the @xmath9 scalar form factors respectively and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath34 and @xmath35 quark masses .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are products of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix elements @xmath38 . as we have shown in @xcite , the @xmath15 dependence of the @xmath4-wave amplitude ( 3rd line of the eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) plays an important role in the description of the sizable enhancement in the @xmath9 mass distributions below 1 gev . in the isobar model",
    "the corresponding @xmath10 dependence is approximated by one fitted constant parameter .",
    "such approximation may not be very good for the wide @xmath6 resonance since the value of @xmath15 varies by a factor almost equal to 10 from the @xmath9 threshold to the limit of our calculations about 1.8 gev .",
    "the scalar and vector @xmath9 form factors are connected to the scattering amplitudes in the @xmath4- and @xmath5-waves via unitarity relations . in the @xmath4-wave",
    "we treat two coupled @xmath39 and @xmath40 channels and in the @xmath5-wave three ones : @xmath39 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding scattering amplitudes are constrained by experimental data , especially by the lass results obtained at slac , and by theoretical constraints at low effective mass .",
    "the muskhelishvili - omnes equations are used to calculate the @xmath3 form factors .",
    "the @xmath39 effective mass and helicity angle distributions , branching fractions , cp asymmetries and the phase difference between the @xmath17 and @xmath18 decay amplitudes to @xmath43 are calculated from our model and fitted , using the minimization program with four phenomenological free parameters @xmath44 , to 319 data obtained by babar and belle collaborations . branching fractions",
    "play a special role as they determine the absolute size of the decay amplitudes . as",
    "an input we use the branching fractions for the @xmath45 decays which are well determined since the @xmath9 @xmath5-wave amplitude below 1 gev is entirely dominated by the @xmath11 resonance .",
    "contrary to the @xmath5-wave amplitude , the @xmath4-wave amplitude contains not only the resonant part related to the wide @xmath6 but also a very broad @xmath46 below 1 gev .",
    "this complexity of the @xmath4-wave results in different parameterizations of the amplitudes in the babar and belle analyzes .",
    "therefore we do not use the experimental branching fractions for the @xmath47 , which are not well determined , being largely model dependent .",
    "some of our model predictions for branching fractions in both waves are given in table  1 .",
    "these numbers have been calculated by integration of the double differential branching fractions in limited ranges of @xmath10 around the @xmath6 and @xmath11 resonances .",
    "the model branching fractions for the @xmath48 decays agree quite well with the corresponding experimental values within their errors .",
    "if the phenomenological parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) are equal to zero , than the theoretical branching fractions for the @xmath5-wave are 4 - 5 times smaller than the experimental ones and those for the @xmath4-wave differ by a factor of 2 .",
    "one can notice that the theoretical results for the @xmath4-wave are lower than the experimental data , being substantially smaller than the belle results but closer to the babar numbers .",

    "the values of the model , calculated by the integration over the given @xmath10 range , are compared to the corresponding belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite results .",

    "can be achieved after introduction of four complex phenomenological coefficients into amplitudes .",
    "these additional parameters are added to the qcd factorization coefficients and can be interpreted as coming from long - distance charming penguin amplitudes , hard spectator and weak annihilation contributions .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath9 @xmath5-wave amplitude is entirely dominated by @xmath11 whereas the @xmath4-wave with the wide resonance @xmath6 and the very wide enhancement below 1 gev ( often interpreted as the @xmath46 meson ) is more complex . in order to correctly account for these resonances we use scalar and vector form factors in the @xmath4- and @xmath5-waves instead of the breit - wigner amplitudes , often employed in the isobar model .",
    "this leads to the background term in the effective mass distributions which is several times smaller than the one obtained in each experimental analysis .",
    "we therefore propose to use in the future experimental analyzes the following parameterization of the @xmath4-wave @xmath60 decay amplitude : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the scalar @xmath9 form factor , while @xmath63 and @xmath64 are complex numbers to be fitted from the data .",
    "numerical values of the complex scalar form factor can be provided on request .",
    "let us emphasize at the end that the amplitudes derived in our analysis @xcite go beyond the two - body approach applied to such decays as @xmath65 .",
    "we have proved that they correctly incorporate the two body final state interactions between @xmath66 and @xmath67 if the effective @xmath9 mass in the three - body @xmath68 decays is limited to about 2 gev ."
