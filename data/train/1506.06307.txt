    "the broken line represents a simple linear regression fit to the abundance values for the rgb and agb stars . ]    the range in both [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] among the rhb stars in our sample is not large , on the order of 0.2 dex in [ na / fe ] and 0.4 dex in [ al / fe ] .",
    "there is no clear correlation in these abundances among the sample of rhb stars .",
    "this may be due to some extent to small sample statistics , since marino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) find a larger range in [ na / fe ] abundance among the rhb stars in m4 of 0.30.4 dex .",
    "nonetheless , marino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) find that in m4 it is only when rhb stars are compared with blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and rr lyrae stars within the cluster that an anticorrelation between [ na / fe ] and [ o / fe ] becomes apparent on the horizontal branch .",
    "thus the lack of a [ na / fe]-[al / fe ] correlation among the rhb stars in our m4 sample is not necessarily inconsistent with the trends between sodium and oxygen found along the entirety of the hb by marino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "based on the cn classifications in smith & briley ( 2005 ) , the cn - strong rgb stars in our sample are l1617 , l4413 , and l4415 , with l2519 being classified as cn - intermediate , while the only cn - weak rgb star in our sample is l1701 .",
    "for these five giants the [ na / fe ] abundances from table 2 are 0.40 , 0.52 , and 0.29 , @xmath43 , and @xmath40 .",
    "thus the average [ na / fe ] for the three cn - strong giants is 0.40 dex .",
    "the cn - intermediate giant l2519 has a similar sodium abundance to the cn - weak giant l1701 , and the average for the two stars is @xmath87 .",
    "consequently our derived [ na / fe ] abundances are consistent with the cn-[na / fe ] correlation in m4 discussed by ivans et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and smith & briley ( 2005 ) .",
    "the pair of cn - weak agb stars , l3207 and l3215 , have [ na / fe ] derived from the mike spectrum of 0.06 and @xmath47 respectively , which for the case of l3215 is consistent with the sodium abundance of the cn - weak rgb star l1701 .",
    "star l1408 was listed by smith & briley ( 2005 ) as having an uncertain evolutionary state , while the [ na / fe ] = 0.16 measured for it is midway between the cn - strong and cn - weak groupings .",
    "here we compare the equivalent widths of the evolved m4 stars to the cn , na , and al abundances . considering the cn - strong giants l1617 , l4413 , and l4415 the values of ew(he ) are 54  m , 88  m , and @xmath88  m . thus two of these giants did exhibit at the time of observation , while one did not . for the cn - intermediate giant l2519 the spectrum provided only an upper limit on ew(he ) of 40 m .",
    "the cn - weak giant l1701 evinced a feature of 100 m  that is greater than for any of the rgb stars with stronger cn absorption bands . also interesting in this regard",
    "is that the two cn - weak agb stars l3207 and l3215 have values of ew(he ) of 102 and @xmath89 m  respectively , by contrast with @xmath90 m  for the cn - strong agb star l1408 .",
    "thus in the case of both the limited number of rgb and agb stars in our sample it is the cn - weak varieties that exhibit the strongest absorption . to this can be coupled the observation that among the three cn - strong rgb stars l1617 , l4413 , and l4415 there is a range of some 70 m  in ew(he ) .",
    "thus the data provide no evidence of any straightforward correlation between cn and he abundance among the evolved giants in m4 . as such , our results for m4 are rather reminiscent of the findings of smith et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for the globular cluster m13 .    considering na and al , in figures 7 and 8",
    "we show plots of ew(he ) versus [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] respectively . here",
    "all the stars , including the rhb stars , are plotted .",
    "there are no clear trends in either of these plots .",
    "abundance for evolved stars in m4 . ]     for evolved stars in m4 . ]",
    "we find no evidence for a correlation between the 10830    line strength and any abundance inhomogeneity in m4 .",
    "as such , there is no evidence from our spectra that he abundance variations are implicated with the cn , o , na , and al abundance inhomogeneities that exist on the rgb and agb of m4 .",
    "the interpretation of these results is not straightforward .",
    "it may be that when the 10830   feature is weaker than 120 m  it is much more sensitive to mass motions in the chromosphere or uv flux than it is to any potential range of he abundance that may exist in m4 .",
    "villanova et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggest that the helium enhancement in m4 over primordial values is small , @xmath60.04 .",
    "indeed , the range of 10830   he line strengths is much smaller in m4 than in the cluster @xmath2 cen , in which this feature provides direct evidence of he abundance variations .",
    "( dupree et al . 2011 ; dupree & avrett 2013 ) . in m4",
    "we have detected helium in two rgb stars with enhanced na and al abundances at an average equivalent width of 84 m . conservatively assuming that the expected change in the equivalent width is comparable to the 15% change in @xmath91 inferred",
    ", then we predict that  first generation \" rgb stars should have 10830   equivalent widths of about 72 m .",
    "given the typical measurement uncertainties , a sample of about 16 rgb stars of similar stellar parameters evenly divided between  first \" and  second \" generation stars would allow a @xmath92 detection of the predicted difference in helium between the two groups .",
    "this estimate is necessarily uncertain : at fixed @xmath3 a variety of effects can change the strength of the 10830   line ; on the other hand , in @xmath2 cen we observed much larger differences in the equivalent width than expected solely on the basis of a linear scaling of the line strength with the helium abundance .    arguably our most striking result is the marked increase in equivalent width of the 10830    line with increasing effective temperature on the horizontal branch of m4 .",
    "this could be attributed to a real variation in he abundance from the red to the blue side of the rhb , or instead to a change in the structure of the chromospheres with increasing @xmath3 . determining whether he abundance variations are truly present would require careful , challenging modeling of the chromospheres of these stars , likely requiring additional data such as h@xmath30 and h and k spectroscopy ( dupree & avrett 2013 ) .",
    "uv observations could also indicate if high temperature regions are present as a result of a magnetically heated atmosphere , providing a mechanism not only to strengthen the helium line but also driving the observed outflows .",
    "one piece of circumstantial evidence consistent with true he abundance variations across the rhb in m4 is the result of marino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who found a systematic difference in o and na abundances between blue and red hb stars .",
    "the blue hb stars tended to have high na and low o compared to the rhb stars : the na  o anticorrelation found among rgb stars of comparable luminosity seems to map into a na  o anticorrelation _ along _ the hb .",
    "if the he abundance varies continuously with the na abundance , then the warmer rhb stars might indeed be expected to have higher he , with this effect being masked in the rgb and agb stars by other atmospheric effects .",
    "but at present we can only suggest this as a possible avenue for further spectroscopy and 10830   line modeling .",
    "the temperature cutoff of the appearance of helium for stars with @xmath93 4450k in m4 , irrespective of evolutionary state , echoes a similar result found in the globular cluster m13 ( smith et al .",
    "2004 ) and in metal - poor field stars ( dupree et al . 2009 ) . in this context , the claimed detection ( pasquini et al . 2011 ) of helium in one extremely cool luminous red giant in ngc 2808 ( @xmath3= 3843k ) is surprising and might be a transient phenomenon , perhaps arising during a phase of modest pulsation of the star .",
    "we note that the @xmath3 limit below which helium is not observed in metal - poor stars is similar to that at which h@xmath30 emission becomes prominent in rgb stars in the globular cluster m15 , which was hypothesized to be related to the onset of pulsations in stars with @xmath94 4500k ( meszaros et al .",
    "this study also found that h@xmath30 emission is present in agb stars in m15 at warmer temperatures than for rgb stars , suggesting that both @xmath3 and evolutionary state are important determinants of the structure of the chromosphere .",
    "less relevant for abundances , we also note the pronounced incidence of strong he absorption profiles among rhb stars in m4 and the frequency with which high - velocity absorption extends towards the line .",
    "mass outflows with speeds of up to 80 - 100 km s@xmath1 are suggested by the blueward absorption profiles seen in some stars .",
    "the chromospheric escape velocity at 2 stellar radii equals @xmath95 km s@xmath1 for a star of mass 0.7 @xmath96 and @xmath97 , higher than the velocities established for the rhb stars , though these values may be below the terminal velocities of the outflows .",
    "strong absorption and outflows have also been documented among rhb of the galactic halo field population by dupree et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , where speeds approaching chromospheric escape velocities are found .",
