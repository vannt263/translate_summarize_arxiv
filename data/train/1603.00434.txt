    "as mentioned before the former model has been derived from the predictions of equation  ( 1 ) and therefore the points must fall near the theoretical curve .",
    "however the latter model do not make any kind of assumption constraining the relative values of the damping rate and the frequency and yet agrees with the same theoretical prediction .",
    "therefore we conclude that equation  ( 1 ) quantitatively describes the scissors oscillations found with our local correlation analysis scheme .",
    "using our model fit enables to reduce the error bars and thus to extract the low frequency branch from the noise .",

    "<S> the larger error bars result from a smaller number of pixels involved in the average . </S>",
    "<S> this local analysis is even more sensitive to frequency shifts and allows a more accurate determination of the position of the boundary between the two phases at @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the hydrodynamic part of the gas present at the center to the superfluid phase of the degenerate quasi-2d bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> one may wonder if a hydrodynamic classical gas at high density could explain our observation . from the independent measurement of the equilibrium values of @xmath13 and @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the scaled distance from the trap center at which the reduced local chemical potential @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , reaches the critical value for the bkt transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicated by the vertical blue solid line in figure  [ fig : frequency_annulus ] , in good agreement with our observed crossover . </S>",
    "<S> the small discrepancy could be explained in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , close to the critical radius , the finite extension @xmath66 of our local probe averages the signal over both the superfluid and normal regions . </S>",
    "<S> second , finite size effects for a trapped cloud , away from the thermodynamic limit , modify the position of the expected boundary anyway . indeed , a quantum monte carlo simulation of a quasi two - dimensional trapped bose gas with our parameters has shown that the normal to superfluid crossover is broadened by about in the sample , resulting in a non - zero superfluid fraction beyond the critical radius predicted by the lda . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus confident that we observe the superfluid to classical transition signature in the dynamical response of the gas .    </S>",
    "<S> we now come to the interpretation of the local relaxation time @xmath67 deduced from the local analysis . we find that its value is in good agreement with the inverse of the local collision rate @xmath68 evaluated in the confinement dominated three - dimensional regime  @xcite , where @xmath69 is the measured average 2d density on the annulus . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the use of equation   to describe the local dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that our analysis could give access to a local relaxation time of the excitation , a key ingredient in finite temperature two - fluid models  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> conversely we use the measured @xmath67 to estimate the local collision rate and hence the local phase space density , knowing the sample temperature . the vertical dashed magenta line in figure  [ fig : frequency_annulus ] </S>",
    "<S> indicates the radius at which this estimated local phase space density becomes higher than the bkt critical phase space density @xmath70 computed for this quasi-2d gas  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the dynamics thus confirms the location of the boundary between the superfluid and normal phases .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to a quantitative analysis of the damping rates @xmath35 of the local correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we will only consider the upper frequency branch , sketched on figure  [ fig : damping_landau](a ) , as the lower frequency is highly damped in our experiments . in order to get a reliable estimate of the frequency and damping rates of the scissors oscillation for both the central and outer regions , </S>",
    "<S> we exclude the crossover area and compute the @xmath3 averages over a disc for the central part and over a large annulus for the outer part , as illustrated on figure  [ fig : damping_landau](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : damping_landau](b ) compares the measured reduced damping rate of the scissors oscillations @xmath71 to the reduced landau damping @xmath72  @xcite : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the sound velocity for a pancake - shaped bose gas  @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> however for the datasets with a large thermal fraction , the damping in the superfluid phase deviates from the predicted landau damping and is of the same order of magnitude than the damping in the normal phase , suggesting that this additional damping originates from collisional coupling to the normal gas  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced damping rate in the normal phase is approximately constant for all our datasets . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in our 2d geometry the abnormal damping can not be explained by a resonant beliaev coupling to other modes as observed in three - dimensional experiments  @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the dynamics of a quasi-2d bose gas near the bkt transition . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown the coexistence of a superfluid fraction and a thermal part by a direct , in situ , local analysis of its dynamical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we use the frequency of the scissors mode as a local probe of superfluidity . whereas a global analysis of the data fails to reveal the coexistence of the superfluid and normal oscillations , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a new local correlation analysis , reminiscent of the local density approximation , which allows to locate the normal to superfluid transition , using a purely dynamical criterion . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the boundary is in good agreement with the crossover expected from the equilibrium properties of the gas . in principle it should be possible with this local probe to observe the superfluid density jump at the bkt transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates future numerical studies of finite temperature dynamics to establish quantitatively the relation between local scissors frequency and local superfluid fraction .    local correlation analysis </S>",
    "<S> could also be applied to numerical simulations . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the local measurement of relaxation times would be useful to compare experiments to numerical calculations at finite temperature . </S>",
