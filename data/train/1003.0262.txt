    "incommensurately - modulated antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations appear to be a universal feature in the hole - doped high - temperature superconducting cuprates la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 ( lsco ) and yba@xmath11cu@xmath12o@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite neutron - scattering measurements of the low - energy dynamical af correlations in underdoped samples reveal peaks at the wave vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 in reciprocal lattice units ( r.l.u . ) of the cuo@xmath11 square lattice ( 1 r.l.u .",

    "@xmath17 is referred to as an incommensurability .",
    "these magnetic signals disperse inwards , become commensurate at a intermediate energy range , and then disperse outwards , exhibiting the characteristic `` hour - glass '' shaped spectrum .",
    "@xcite in lsco , such low - energy incommensurate ( ic ) magnetic correlations disappear coincidently with the disappearance of the superconductivity in the heavily overdoped region , indicating a strong correlation between superconductivity and af correlations .",
    "@xcite however , in cuprates with higher @xmath18 s , such as bi- , tl- , and hg - systems , reports of magnetic fluctuations are very sparse  @xcite and clear ic af correlations have not been observed , whereas the commensurate resonant magnetic scattering in the superconducting state has been observed .",
    "@xcite thus , there are gaps in the experimental record relevant to understanding the role of magnetism in the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "very recently , it has been reported that the replacement of a small amount of cu sites by magnetic fe@xmath19 ions in the la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 ( lsco ) and overdoped bi@xmath0pb@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath5 ( bpsco ) systems dramatically stabilizes a short - range ( sr ) ic magnetic correlation .",
    "@xcite in the latter case , neutron - scattering measurements clarified the sr ic magnetic correlation below 40 k ,  @xcite unveiling potential ic spin correlations in the single - layered bi - based cuprate system .",
    "remarkably , the observed incommensurability is @xmath20  r.l.u .",
    "this value is approximately equal to the effective hole concentration of the sample , consistent with a trend found in underdoped lsco , but greatly exceeding the well - known saturation limit of @xmath21 r.l.u . in the lsco system .",
    "@xcite    there have been a number of reports that non - magnetic and magnetic impurities , such as zn and ni , substituted for cu atoms in superconducting lsco stabilize ic magnetic order .",
    "@xcite the induced order is attributed to a static stripe order resulting from trapping of hole carriers by the impurities . on the other hand , the disappearance of low - energy ic magnetic correlations in the overdoped lsco  @xcite implies no stripe correlation to be stabilized by impurities in the overdoped region .",
    "thus , the newly found ic magnetic correlation in fe - doped overdoped bpsco may have a different origin from stripe order . in order to clarify this issue , we performed resistivity and neutron diffraction studies under magnetic fields , since the effect of magnetic fields on the stripe magnetic order has been well studied in lsco and related compounds",
    ". this problem should give new insights into the origin of the ic magnetic correlations of the high - temperature superconducting cuprates in the overdoped metallic regime .",
    "we find that the sample shows a negative magnetoresistive effect : that is , the resistivity decreases when a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath22-axis .",
    "this effect grows below 40  k where the sr ic magnetic correlation sets in .",
    "neutron diffraction reveals that an applied magnetic field slightly reduces the ic magnetic correlation .",
    "these effects are in contrast with the effect of magnetic fields on stripes in the lsco system , in which the stripes with @xmath23  r.l.u .",
    "are generally stable in magnetic fields ; in fact , static order is typically enhanced by an applied field in the underdoped regime.@xcite as an alternative , dilute magnetic moments in a metallic alloy may be a relevant model for the present case .",
    "fe spins in the metallic background in the overdoped bpsco may behave as kondo scatterers .",
    "this induces the kondo effect in the resistivity and magnetic correlation appears by the rkky interaction .",
    "magnetic fields compete with the exchange coupling between conduction electrons and impurity moments in kondo systems , and such an effect might explain our observation that the fe - induced magnetic order is reduced by magnetic fields .",

    "the deviation from the curie law below @xmath54  k might be due to a precursor of the cluster glass state , since the temperature of 40  k is close to the point where sr magnetic correlation sets in , as we will show later .    at very low temperatures , @xmath56 ,",

    "the system gains electron conductivity by an external magnetic field , showing a negative magnetoresistive effect .",
    "in addition , the spin system freezes into a glass state at low temperature .",
    "a model to consider is that of dilute magnetic alloys , such as cu alloyed with a few percent of mn . beyond the direct analogy of dilute magnetic moments",
    "doped into a metallic system , these systems exhibit spin - glass ordering at low temperature , with static magnetic correlations at an ic wave vector,@xcite and an up turn in resistivity at low temperature termed the kondo effect.@xcite the magnetic correlations are attributed to the rkky interaction ( i.e. , the coupling of local moments by conduction electrons ) , and the ic wave vector appears to correspond to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the fermi wave vector.@xcite    the present sample is located in the overdoped region , having a hole concentration of @xmath24/cu estimated from arpes measurements .",
    "@xcite an arpes study of ( bi , pb)@xmath11(sr , la)@xmath11cuo@xmath5 by kondo _ et al._@xcite indicates that correlation effects , such as the pseudogap , are greatly reduced for overdoped samples . that observation is consistent with neutron - scattering studies of lsco indicating that antiferromagnetic correlations become quite weak with overdoping.@xcite thus , it is reasonable to consider the fe spins doped into the metallic background of the overdoped bpsco as kondo scatterers that reduce the mobility of the charge carriers.@xcite the resistivity at low temperature varies as @xmath7 , which is consistent with kondo behavior .",
    "scattering of the conduction electrons by the fe moments could induce magnetic correlations at @xmath95 , resulting in magnetic clusters .",
    "compensation of the fe moments by conduction electrons is , at best , only partial .",
    "magnetic fields would easily couple to the fe moments , and suppress the @xmath97 exchange interaction between the local moments and conduction electrons , which is the source of both the kondo effect and the rkky interaction .",
    "therefore the ic magnetic correlation is depressed by moderate magnetic fields , and the system shows the negative magnetoresistive effect .",
    "the negative magnetoresistive effect is also discussed on the basis of the kondo effect in refs .   and .",
    "there are several reports of impurity induced magnetic order in the under- and optimally - doped 214 compounds .",
    "@xcite in the latter cases , the induced order is a static stripe order around the impurity atoms owing to trapping of hole carriers by impurities , and the ordered regions appear to behave as non - superconducting islands .",
    "@xcite we next consider whether this picture might be applicable to the present case .",
    "let us start with the large spin incommensurability of @xmath98 found in fe - doped bpsco .",
    "if we try to interpret this in terms of coupled charge and spin stripes , then the corresponding spin period of 5 cu - o - cu period would imply a charge stripe period of 2.5 lattice spacings .",
    "that would require the charge and spin stripes to be not much wider than a single row of cu atoms",
    ". given that stripe order involves competition between strongly - correlated antiferromagnetism and the kinetic energy of the doped holes , it seems unlikely that such narrow domains could be energetically favorable , especially in the overdoped regime .",
    "for reference , the spin modulations in lsco and nd - doped lsco tend to saturate at about 8 lattice spacings for @xmath99.@xcite    the response to an applied magnetic field is another area of contrasting behavior .",
    "underdoped lsco , la@xmath8ba@xmath9cuo@xmath10 ( lbco ) , and nd - doped lsco , particularly in the vicinity of 1/8 hole concentration , have a strong tendency towards static stripe order .",
    "previous neutron scattering studies of these materials under magnetic fields revealed that the stripe order is enhanced for lsco  @xcite , or stays constant for lbco  @xcite and nd - doped lsco  @xcite ; in any case , the stripe order is never weakened by fields up to at least 7  t. these facts suggest that stripe order is robust against magnetic field , which is opposite to the present result .",
    "negative magnetoresistance has been observed in a limited number of cuprates , generally in cases where superconductivity is absent .",
    "examples include lightly - doped lsco ,  @xcite electron - doped thin films ,  @xcite and zn - doped bi@xmath11sr@xmath8la@xmath9cuo@xmath5  @xcite ; in the case of la@xmath100eu@xmath101sr@xmath102cuo@xmath103 , the decrease in @xmath22-axis resistivity due to an applied field was shown unambiguously to be due to spin scattering effects.@xcite more commonly , positive magnetoresistance is observed.@xcite the salient point here is that negative magnetoresistance has not been observed in stripe ordered systems . in the cases of lsco , lbco and nd - doped lsco with stripe order near the 1/8 hole concentration , the resistivity at low temperatures is generally increased due to the reduction in @xmath18 by applying a magnetic field , while the `` normal '' state resistivity above the zero - field @xmath18 is relatively insensitive to applied fields.@xcite thus , the negative magnetoresistance observed in fe - doped bpsco is another argument against a stripe interpretation .",
    "based on the above discussion , we conclude that the present sample bi@xmath0pb@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath3fe@xmath4o@xmath5 is analogous to the dilute magnetic alloys , in which the kondo behavior is relevant , and therefore the sr ic magnetic correlation induced by fe - doping in the present `` overdoped '' bpsco system originates from the correlation via polarization of conduction electron , the rkky interaction .",
    "the magnetic incommensurability should reflect the fermi surface topology .",
    "in contrast , magnetic or non - magnetic impurities doped in the `` underdoped '' cuprates induce stripe ordered state . in that case",
    ", the incommensurability corresponds to the inverse of the stripe modulation period .",
    "this difference between the underdoped and overdoped regimes might come from the difference in electronic nature : the former is in the strongly - correlated regime while the latter is in the metallic regime .",
    "it is remarkable that the magnetic correlation in stripes in the underdoped superconducting region and that by the rkky interaction in the present overdoped compound have the same modulation direction along the cu - o - cu bond .",
    "furthermore , the incommensurabilities for both cases follow the @xmath104 relation .",
    "this raises the possibility of an interesting test of the nature of the magnetic excitations . in the under- to optimally - doped regimes ,",
    "the magnetic spectrum is characterized by an `` hour - glass '' dispersion .",
    "there has been controversy over the the extent to which this spectrum derives from local moments or conduction electrons .",
    "can such a spectrum be observed in the present fe - doped bpsco sample ?",
    "if so , it would lend support to the argument that the conduction electrons are largely responsible for the magnetic response near optimal doping . if not , it would be consistent with the view that hour - glass spectrum is a consequence of strongly - correlated antiferromagnetism . either way",
    ", measurements of the spin dynamics of this sample would yield interesting results .",
    "fe impurities in the overdoped bpsco system induce sr ic magnetic correlation with unexpectedly large incommensurability @xmath6 below 40  k. we have studied the magnetic field dependence of the magnetic correlation by neutron diffraction and the field dependence of the in - plane resistivity .",
    "the magnetic peaks observed by neutron scattering show a small reduction in an applied magnetic field , and the resistivity shows a clear negative magnetoresistive effect below 40  k. such behavior is different from that typical of stripe ordered lsco , lbco and nd - doped lsco where the stripe order is robust against the magnetic fields .",
    "the present results show greater similarities to dilute magnetic alloys , in which the kondo effect is relevant .",
    "the fe spins in the overdoped metallic background produces a kondo effect which results in the up turn in the resistivity at low temperature in the form of @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "sr magnetic correlation is induced by the rkky interaction .",
    "magnetic fields couple to the fe moments , competing with the exchange interaction between the local moments and conduction electrons .",
