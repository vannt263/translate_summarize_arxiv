    "wind is one of the most important renewable energy sources .",
    "wind energy is produced by converting the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy by means of a generator .",
    "for this reason it is important to dispose of an efficient stochastic model for wind speed changes . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "the authors showed that an indexed semi - markov chain ( ismc ) reproduces almost exactly the statistical features of wind speed .",
    "in particular , it was shown that density and autocorrelation functions of a time series of real wind speed and those obtained by the ismc model through monte carlo simulation were almost indistinguishable .    in this work",
    "we use the ismc model to compute dependability measures as availability , reliability and maintainability functions for the index semi - markov process .",
    "these indicators give important information on the feasibility of the investment in a wind farm by giving the possibility to quantify the uncertainty in the wind energy production .",
    "another important aspect is related to the location of the wind farm .",
    "in fact , today many wind farm are built offshore for different reasons : the wind speed is more powerful and constant due to the absence of obstacles , the visual , environmental and acoustic impact is cut down .",
    "the maintenance cost , instead , is higher than the onshore wind farm .",
    "a good stochastic model can help the planning of preventive maintenance suggesting when it is suitable to do the maintenance operation .",
    "the results presented here are new and generalize some of the results obtained for semi - markov chain(see @xcite ) . the model generalizes also markov chains and renewal models .",
    "+ we apply our model to a real case of energy production . for this reason we choose a commercial wind turbine ,",
    "a 10 kw aricon hawt assumed to be installed at the station of l.s.i -lastem which is situated in italy .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents some definitions and notation on the indexed semi - markov chain .",
    "section 3 describes the database and the technical characteristics of the commercial wind turbine .",
    "section 4 shows the way in which it is possible to compute the dependability measures via kernel transformations and the value computed on the real data and on the synthetic data are compared . in the last section",
    "some concluding remarks and possible extensions are presented .",
    "in this section , we give a short review of a particular indexed semi - markov model advanced in @xcite as a novel synthetic time series generation method for wind speed data which is able to capture the persistence in the wind speed data and we give new probabilistic result about the transition probability function .",
    "+ let us consider the stochastic process @xmath0 with a finite state space @xmath1 . in our framework",
    "the random variable @xmath2 describes the wind speed at the @xmath3-th transition , that is at the @xmath3-th change of speed value and , the state space @xmath4 , describes the discretized wind speeds , see section 3 for a specific choice of @xmath4 .",
    "+ let us also consider the stochastic process @xmath5 with values in @xmath6 .",
    "the random variable @xmath7 describes the time in which the @xmath3-th change of value of the wind speed occurs .",
    "we denote the stochastic process @xmath8 of the sojourn times in wind speed state @xmath9 before the @xmath3th jump .",
    "thus we have for all @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "+ let us consider another stochastic process @xmath12 with values in @xmath13 .",
    "the random variable @xmath14 describes the value of the index process at the @xmath3th transition : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a generic function and @xmath17 are known and non - random . +",
    "the function @xmath18 depends on the state of the system @xmath19 and on the time @xmath20 .",
    "+ the process @xmath21 can be interpreted as a moving average of the accumulated reward process with the function @xmath18 as a measure of the permanence reward per unit time .",
    "+ it should be noted that the order of the moving average is on the number of transitions @xmath22 which is fixed .",
    "anyway , the moving average is executed on time windows of variable length @xmath23 because each transition has a random sojourn time @xmath24 of permanence in state @xmath25 before the next jump .",
    "+ the indexed model is fully specified once the dependence structure between the variables is assumed . toward this end",
    "we adopt the following assumption : @xmath26\\\\ & = \\mathbb{p}[j_{n+1}=j,\\ : t_{n+1}-t_{n}\\leq t |j_{n}=i , v_{n}^{m}=v]=:q_{ij}^{m}(v;t ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 represents the set of past values , of the processes @xmath28 .",
    "the matrix of functions @xmath29 is called @xmath30 @xmath31-@xmath32 @xmath33 . + the joint process @xmath34 , which is embedded in the indexed semi - markov kernel , depends on the moving average process @xmath21 , the latter acts as a stochastic index",
    ". moreover , the index process @xmath21 depends on @xmath34 through the functional relationship @xmath35 .",
    "+ observe that if @xmath36=\\mathbb{p}[j_{n+1}=j,\\ : t_{n+1}-t_{n}\\leq t |j_{n}=i],\\ ] ] for all values @xmath37 of the index process , then the indexed semi - markov kernel degenerates in an ordinary semi - markov kernel and the model becomes equivalent to classical semi - markov chain models as presented for example in @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the process @xmath34 on the new variable @xmath21 is introduced in order to capture the effect of the past transitions on the future ones for those processes which are strongly autocorrelated .",
    "+ one of the main problem is the proposal of a particular choice of the index process which is useful in describing the wind speed process . to this end",
    "we need to choose a specific form of the function @xmath18 .",
    "+ the choice is motivated by some physical reasons and by model simplicity .",
    "let us briefly remind that wind speed data are long range positively autocorrelated .",
    "this implies that there are periods of high and low speed",
    ". motivated by the empirical facts in @xcite we supposed that also the transition probabilities from current wind speed @xmath2 to the next one @xmath38 depends on whether the wind is , on average , in a high speed period or in a low one .",
    "we then fixed the function @xmath18 to be the wind speed itself , i.e. @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "consequently , substituting ( [ f ] ) in equation ( [ funcrela ] ) and considering that @xmath41 is constant in @xmath20 we obtain @xmath42 in this simple case the index process @xmath43 expresses a moving average of order @xmath22 executed on the series of the wind speed values @xmath44 with weights given by the fractions of sojourn times in that wind speed @xmath45 , with respect to the interval time on which the average is executed @xmath46 .",
    "+ the consequence of the choice ( [ f ] ) is that the assumption ( [ kernel ] ) now states that : @xmath47.\\ ] ] relation @xmath48 asserts that the knowledge of the last wind speed value @xmath49 and of the weighted moving average @xmath50 of order @xmath22 of past wind speeds suffices to give the conditional distribution of the couple @xmath38 , @xmath51 whatever the values of the past variables might be .",
    "essentially we consider that the average of the past @xmath52 speeds contains most of the information needed to establish the probability of the next wind speed transition .",
    "we will show later that , with this assumption , the model is able to capture the temporal dependence structure of real data .",
    "+ we introduce now auxiliary probabilities which are helpful in the sequel of the analysis .",
    "denote by @xmath53.\\ ] ] they represent the transition probabilities of the embedded indexed markov chain .",
    "more precisely @xmath54 denotes the probability that the next transition is into wind speed @xmath55 given that at current time the wind speed process entered state @xmath56 and the index process had value @xmath57 .",

    "we refer to @xmath73 as an indexed semi - markov chain .",
    "+ the process @xmath74 extends the process @xmath21 because the time @xmath62 can be a transition or a waiting time .",
    "it is simple to realize that , @xmath75 , if @xmath76 we have that @xmath77 .",
    "+ let us introduce the stochastic process @xmath78 which is called backward recurrence time process and denotes the time since the last transition . +",
    "this process is very important in a semi - markovian framework and it is well known that the transition probabilities of a semi - markov process depend on the value of the recurrence time process , see e.g. @xcite . +",
    "this is due to the fact that the conditional waiting time distribution functions @xmath79 can be of any type and then , also no memoryless distributions can be used . in this case , the time since the last transition of the system ( backward value ) influences the system s transition probabilities ; this is the so called duration effect .",
    "+ to properly assess the probabilistic behavior of the system , we need to introduce the transition probability function . to this end , it is useful to introduce the following notation : @xmath80 @xmath81 with the equality @xmath82 we denote the fact that @xmath83 and similarly with @xmath84 we indicate that @xmath85 finally by @xmath86 we denote the couple of ordered vectors @xmath87 .",
