    "the high - spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory is allowing supernova remnants ( snrs ) in m31 to be resolved at x - ray wavelengths for the first time @xcite .",

    "optical emission - line surveys of m31 date back to @xcite , and x - ray surveys back to @xcite . without digital imaging to allow the subtraction of continuum emission from the emission - line images and without high spatial resolution x - ray data , reliable determination of counterparts was difficult for these early surveys . while optical surveys continued to catalog hundreds of snrs in m31 ( e.g. @xcite ) , rosat studies had little luck in discovering x - ray snrs in m31 @xcite .    very recently , with deep _",

    "section  [ results ] discusses the x - ray , optical and radio properties of the snrs , and section  [ conclusions ] provides a summary of our conclusions .",
    "we obtained the [ o  iii ] , [ s  ii ] , h@xmath0 and @xmath3-band images of the lgs field 5 from the lgs website.massey/lgsurvey ] these images have already been properly flat - fielded and the geometric distortions removed so that the coordinates in the images are good to @xmath40.25@xmath5 on the fk5 system and the images at the different bandpasses are registered with one another .",
    "we therefore were easily able to subtract the @xmath3-band continuum from the [ o  iii ] image and the @xmath6-band continuum from the [ s  ii ] and h@xmath0 images in order to make the line - emitting sources stand out .",
    "we performed a rough calibration of the lgs [ o  iii ] image by matching the [ o  iii ] fluxes of 10 planetary nebulae ( pne ) with published [ o  iii ] fluxes @xcite .",
    "this calibration provided a conversion factor of 5.5 @xmath7 erg @xmath8 ct@xmath9 .",
    "we also roughly calibrated the h@xmath0 and [ s  ii ] images by matching the fluxes of the snr ddb 1 - 15 @xcite to the fluxes measured in the calibrated data set of @xcite ( h@xmath10 2s ; [ s  ii ] = 5.5 @xmath11 2s ) .",
    "this calibration yielded conversion factors of 1.0 @xmath7 erg @xmath8 ct@xmath9 and 1.8 @xmath7 erg @xmath8 ct@xmath9 in h@xmath0 and [ s ii ] respectively . using these [ o  iii ] , h@xmath0 , and [ s ii ] factors",
    ", we converted the lgs count rates to units of 2s .",
    "we also obtained a deep _ chandra _ acis - s image centered on the m31 nucleus ( obsid 1575 ) .",
    "this data set , obtained on 05-oct-2001 , had an exposure time of 37.7 ks , target r.a.=00:42:44.4 , target dec.=41:16:08.3 , and a roll angle of 180.42 degrees .",
    "we created exposure maps for this image using the ciao script _",

    "we aligned the coordinate system of the acis - s image with the lgs coordinate system by translating and adjusting the plate scale of the acis - s coordinate system so that 13 globular cluster sources had the same coordinates as the centroids of the respective globular clusters in the lgs @xmath3-band image .",
    "this transformation , performed using the iraf task _ ccmap _ , had root - mean - square ( rms ) residuals of 0.16@xmath5 in ra and 0.15@xmath5 in dec .",
    "these errors were added in quadrature to the position errors of the sources determined by _ wavdetect _ to determine the final position errors for x - ray sources on the lgs [ o iii ] image .",
    "we extracted energy spectra and the associated responses from the acis - s image with the ciao task _ psextract _ and caldb version 2.26 , which automatically corrects for the degradation in the effective low - energy quantum efficiency of the acis detectors .",
    "the background spectra were extracted with an annulus region .",
    "since we only have 43 counts ( 37 background - subtracted ) for r2 - 57 and 37 counts ( 31 background - subtracted ) for r3 - 84 , we used two methods to fit the spectra from 0.35 kev .",
    "we first binned the spectra with @xmath175 counts per bin and employed @xmath18-gehrels statistics to find the best fit using the ciao 3.0/sherpa fitting package @xcite .",
    "errors were estimated using the sherpa command _ projection _ , which varies each parameter s value independently along a grid of values to determine the 1@xmath19 confidence intervals .",
    "we fit the spectra with two single - component models with absorption : power - law and raymond - smith ( rs ) .",
    "the power - law model is commonly a good fit to the continuum of x - ray spectra and has 3 free parameters : index , absorption column , and normalization .",
    "the rs model is often used to describe the spectra of snrs .",
    "we applied this model with the abundance parameter fixed to solar and the redshift fixed to zero , leaving 3 free parameters : temperature , absorption column and normalization .",
    "results are discussed in   [ xspec ] and shown in figure  [ spec ] . to verify the results",
    ", we then fit the unbinned spectra ( background not subtracted ) with cash statistics @xcite .",
    "we further investigated the nature of the x - ray sources by calculating the hardness ratios of the detected counts .",
    "these were calculated from counts extracted in 3 different energy bins . the soft bin ( s )",
    "contains photons of energies 0.31 kev . the medium bin ( m ) contains photons of energies 12 kev .",
    "the hard bin ( h ) contains photons of energies 28 kev .",
    "the final background - subtracted hardness ratio equations were h1 = ( m - s)/(h+m+s ) and h2 = ( h - m)/(h+m+s ) @xcite .",
    "these hardness ratios are discussed in   [ xspec ] .",
    "finally , we checked the results of the _ chandra _ energy spectra with _ xmm - newton _ archival data , since the effective area of _ xmm - newton _ is much larger than that of _ chandra_. there are four _ xmm - newton _ observations of the center of m31 with exposure times from @xmath41060 ks .",
    "unfortunately , one of the snrs ( r2 - 57 ; see   [ search ] ) lies too close to the center of m31 to be resolved from the diffuse emission at the resolution of _ xmm - newton _ ; we therefore could not perform a reliable spectral fit for any _ xmm - newton _ observation of this snr .",
    "the other snr ( r3 - 84 ; see ",
    "[ search ] ) is in the gap between ccd chips in two of the four _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "we performed spectral analyses on the other two observations , taken on 29-jun-2001 ( obsid=0109270101 , target r.a.=00:42:43 , target dec.=41:15:46 , p.a.=76.05 degrees , medium filter , and exposure=30.6 ks ) and 06-jan-2002 ( obsid=0112570101 , target r.a.=00:42:43 , target dec.=41:15:46 , p.a.=249.84 degrees , thin1 filter , and exposure=56.5 ks ) .",
    "we extracted the 0.35 kev spectra with the _ xmm - newton _ sas package v5.4.1 ; only epic - pn spectra were considered because of the higher sensitivity .",
    "the spectra were binned to have at least 15 counts per spectral bin in order to allow the use of @xmath18 statistics .",
    "background spectra were extracted from source free regions .",

    "[ xspec ] , and shown in figure  [ xmm ] .",
    "as both of the newly - discovered snrs are several arcminutes off - axis in the _ chandra _ data , there is a possibility that the larger off - axis point spread function ( psf ) of _ chandra _ could be misinterpreted as an extended source in the x - ray image . to test this possibility",
    ", we used the snrs spectral fits to simulate their _ chandra _ psf at their location on the acis - s detector .",
    "the simulation was performed with the web - based psf simulator chart .",
    "psf simulations containing about the same number of counts as the detections are shown next to the x - ray snr detections in figures  [ r257 ] and [ r384 ] .",
    "we also produced psf simulations with @xmath410@xmath20 counts .",
    "azimuthally averaged profiles of these simulations and of the snr detections were measured in 1.5@xmath5 annuli .",
    "@xmath18 tests of the detected snrs profiles against the simulated psfs ( normalized to the surface brightness of the central 3@xmath5 of the snr detection ) were calculated to assess whether the snrs were resolved ( results in   [ xraysize ] ) .",
    "the number of counts in each annulus ranged from 121 in the snr detections .",
    "profile errors were determined by gehrels statistics @xcite in annuli with @xmath2110 counts and by standard poisson statistics in annuli containing @xmath1710 counts .",
    "results are discussed in   [ xraysize ] .",
    "the radio data was collected from a 20 cm vla survey source list presented by braun ( 1990 ) complemented by a recent 6 cm vla b - array observation @xcite .",
    "we also retrieved 20 cm low resolution vla c - array and 6 cm vla d - array data from the nrao archive .",
    "these data sets , albeit pointed to the center of m31 instead of directly at the snrs , were the most sensitive data sets to search for arcsecond extended radio counterparts .",
    "@xcite observed a field - of - view of about 8@xmath22 using the vla at 6 cm for 22 hours on three days in june 2002 , obtaining an angular resolution of 1.2@xmath5 and the ability to detect angular structures up to about 35@xmath5 .",
    "the 20 cm ( 6 cm ) archive vla data with a field - of - view of about 30@xmath22 ( 8@xmath22 ) in diameter was taken during 20 ( 19 ) hours on three ( four ) days in august 1993 ( july 1992 ) , has an angular resolution of 13@xmath5 ( 14@xmath5 ) and is sensitive to angular structures up to about 15@xmath22 ( 5@xmath22 ) .",
    "the data were all calibrated and imaged in nrao s aips package using the new vlarun pipeline procedure with additional self - calibration for the 20 cm archive data as outlined in the aips cookbook .",
    "the resulting rms noise in the images is 60 ( 15 ) @xmath23jy for the 20 cm ( 6 cm ) archive data , and 6 @xmath23jy for the 6 cm @xcite data .",
    "finally , we retrieved 20 cm high resolution ( 1@xmath5 ; a - array ) vla data from the nrao archive to detect any compact components of these snr candidates .",
    "these data consist of eleven pointings in the center and southern half of m31 .",
    "the data were also calibrated and imaged with the vlarun pipeline procedure .",
    "images with an rms noise of @xmath40.2  mjy were produced .",
    "we visually searched the aligned [ o iii ] image for shell structures with x - ray counterparts by placing 2@xmath5 radius circles onto the [ o  iii ] image centered on the locations of all x - ray sources detected in the acis - s images .",
    "this search yielded 5 counterpart candidates , 3 of which have been cataloged as x - ray snr and were previously discussed in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray images were then inspected at the locations of the two new snrs .",
    "figures  [ r257 ] and [ r384 ] show the _ chandra _ , h@xmath0 , [ o  iii ] , [ s  ii ] , and vla ( low resolution 20 cm ) images of each new snr .",
    "these 2 new matches showed previously - cataloged x - ray counterparts : cxom31  j004224.1 + 411733 ( r2 - 57 ) and cxom31  j004248.9 + 412406 ( r3 - 84 ) @xcite .",
    "once the two new matches in optical and x - ray were found , radio counterparts were sought for in the list of braun ( 1990 ) .",
    "indeed , r3 - 84 is listed as an extended source ( source number 97 ) .",
    "source r2 - 57 is located near an area of diffuse emission and , although not listed in braun ( 1990 ) , is marginally visible in his figure 3 .",
    "we therefore also checked our recent 6 cm vla data @xcite .",
    "the 6 cm data has only a limited field - of - view , with a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 500@xmath5 , meaning that r3 - 84 is too far away from the field center ( 8@xmath22 ) to be visible .",
    "however we found a @xmath410@xmath5 extended 2@xmath19 patch at the position of r2 - 57 .",
    "this triggered a search in the vla archive for more sensitive data for which we chose the sets discussed in ",
    "[ radiodata ] .",
    "the archive data does confirm a radio detection of r2 - 57 , at 20 cm and at 6 cm , and yields an additional independent radio detection of r3 - 84 at 20 cm .",
    "no other radio matches were found in the literature .",
    "we were able to constrain the physical properties of both snrs with their spectra from _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. plots of the best fits using the rs model are provided in figure  [ spec ] and [ xmm ] .    for r2 - 57 ,",
    "the binned spectrum is well - fit by a power - law model with @xmath24  ( 1@xmath19 ) , @xmath25 @xmath8 ( @xmath26 for 5 degrees of freedom ( dof ) ) and 0.37 kev luminosity of 3.4@xmath27 erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum is also fit well by an rs model with kt  =  0.17@xmath28 kev and @xmath29  =  ( 8.9@xmath303.2 )  @xmath31 @xmath8 ( @xmath32 for 5 dof ) and an absorption - corrected 0.37 kev luminosity of 4.3@xmath33  erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "fits of the unbinned spectrum give similar results .    in the case of r3 - 84 , a power - law model does not fit the binned spectrum with reasonable parameters ; the photon index is @xmath1710 suggesting a soft x - ray source . on the other hand , the spectrum is well fit by an rs model with kt @xmath34 kev , @xmath29  =  4@xmath35 @xmath8 ( @xmath36 for 4 dof ) and an absorption - corrected 0.37 kev luminosity of 2.3@xmath37 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "we checked our _ chandra _ spectral results using the two _ xmm - newton _ spectra of r3 - 84 .",
    "these spectra were fit with several single - component models ( with absorption ) including power - law , rs , non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) , and bremsstrahlung models .",
    "the nei and bremsstrahlung models give acceptable fits .",
    "the ( solar abundance ) nei model has @xmath38 for 19 dof with @xmath39 @xmath8 , kt@xmath40 kev , and ionization age @xmath41 s @xmath42 ; the modeled unabsorbed 0.37 kev luminosity is @xmath43 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "the best - fitting single - component model is bremsstrahlung ; it has @xmath44 for 20 dof with @xmath45 @xmath8 and kt@xmath46 kev ; the modeled unabsorbed 0.37 kev luminosity is ( 9.4@xmath302.5 )  @xmath47 erg s@xmath9 .    the overall best - fitting model for the _ xmm _ spectra is an rs plus power - law , kt@xmath48 kev , and modeled unabsorbed 0.37 kev luminosity ( 7@xmath303)@xmath49 erg s@xmath9 , but it had a poor @xmath50 ( 1.44 for 20 dof ) . ] ( see figure  [ xmm ] ) .",
    "it provides a good fit ( @xmath51 for 18 dof ) with @xmath52 @xmath8 , kt@xmath53 , and power - law slope @xmath54 ; the modeled unabsorbed 0.37 kev luminosity is @xmath55 erg s@xmath9 . these results are consistent with the _ chandra _ results as well as the temperature and luminosity ranges determined from fits to the _ xmm _ data by @xcite , but the temperature and luminosity are both significantly lower than those given by the nei model fit .",
    "we use the _ chandra _ temperature results , which are consistent with all of the _ xmm _ fits , to calculate age and density estimates in   [ multiprops ] .",
    "while these spectral fits do not allow detailed modeling of the sources , they show that the x - ray spectra and luminosities are typical of x - ray snrs .",
    "the softness of the spectra is confirmed by the hardness ratios . for r2 - 57 , h1  =  @xmath560.5@xmath300.2 , and h2  =  @xmath560.4@xmath300.1 . for r3 - 84 , , and h2  =  @xmath560.2@xmath300.1 ; these ratios are typical of snrs @xcite .",
    "neither of these sources contain counts with energies higher than 2 kev , also consistent with typical x - ray snrs .",
    "the variability of these x - ray sources has been investigated by @xcite , who found r2 - 57 to have constant flux . on the other hand , r3",
    "- 84 was classified as a variable source in their survey , inconsistent with our finding that this source is an snr .",
    "we checked the variability of this source , and it is variable according to their criteria due to a low count rate in one detection .",
    "further inspection of the detection with the low count rate shows that r3 - 84 is on the edge of the chip , so that some of the source flux could have missed the detector , calling into question the classification of this source as variable .",
    "in addition to the spectrophotometric properties of the snrs , the _ chandra _ data allow estimates of the snrs sizes .",
    "the x - ray detection of r3 - 84 appears as a very faint shell structure 6@xmath5 across .",
    "though the structure appears to be this size in the detection , the _ chandra _ psf 8@xmath22 off axis ( where this detection of r3 - 84 is located ) has a fwhm of 4.1@xmath5 according to our chart simulation ( see    [ psftests ] ) .",
    "a @xmath18 comparison of the azimuthally averaged profile of our detection of r3 - 84 against the azimuthally averaged simulated psf at the same location in the _ chandra _ focal plane yields a @xmath57 of 9.2/4 , leaving only a 5.6% chance that this object is a point source . the x - ray simulation , x - ray image , optical images , and radio image of the source are shown on the same scale , with circles of 8@xmath5 diameter in figure  [ r384 ] .",
    "the x - ray size is very similar to that of the optical ( and the low resolution radio ) counterpart .",
    "the x - ray detection of r2 - 57 also appears as a very faint shell structure , but at @xmath48.5@xmath5 across and 4@xmath22 off - axis ( where the acis - s point spread function is 1.4@xmath5 according to our chart simulation ) , this source is clearly resolved .",
    "the psf simulation ( see    [ psftests ] ) shows no similarity to the shell - like source detection ; a @xmath18 comparison of the azimuthally averaged profile of our detection of r2 - 57 against the azimuthally averaged simulated psf at the same location in the _ chandra _ focal plane yields a @xmath57 of 28.1/4 , leaving a probability of 10@xmath58 that this object is a point source .",
    "the x - ray simulation , x - ray image , optical images , and radio image of the source are shown on the same scale , with circles of 9@xmath5 diameter in figure  [ r257 ] .",
    "the narrow - band lgs images provided estimates of the h@xmath0 , [ s  ii ] , and [ o  iii ] luminosities of these snr , as well as the snr sizes .",
    "the relative strength of these emission lines is a well - known diagnostic for distinguishing shock - heated snrs from photo - ionized h  ii regions and planetary nebulae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the snr sizes and structures help to constrain their ages ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we measured the counts in the narrow - band images using an aperture of 4@xmath5 radius centered on r3 - 84 and an aperture of 5@xmath5 radius centered on r2 - 57 .",
    "the measured h@xmath0 , [ s  ii ] , and [ o  iii ] fluxes , in units of 10@xmath59 erg @xmath15 s@xmath9 were 1.0 , 0.9 , and 1.5 for r2 - 57 , respectively , and 1.1 , 0.9 , and 1.7 for r3 - 84 , respectively .",
    "these [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios of @xmath40.9 are strong indications that these objects are snrs .",
    "typically , snrs have [ s  ii]/h@xmath60 , while the ratios of h ii regions are lower @xcite .",
    "the [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 ratio must be corrected for absorption because of the large difference in wavelength .",
    "we used the @xmath29 values from the x - ray spectral fits ( see   [ xspec ] ) to estimate the reddening values of the snrs @xcite .",
    "these values were @xmath61 } \\sim 5.0 $ ] for r2 - 57 and @xmath62 } \\sim 2.2 $ ] for r3 - 84 . assuming a standard reddening law , @xmath63 for r2 - 57 and @xmath64 for r3 - 84 , so that the absorption - corrected [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 ratios are factors of 3.2 and 1.7 higher than the measured ratios , for r2 - 57 and r3 - 84 , respectively .",
    "the [ o  iii]/h@xmath0 ratios are therefore @xmath45 and @xmath43 for r2 - 57 and r3 - 84 , respectively .",
    "such ratios are slightly high , but not unprecedented for snrs containing a variety of shock velocities @xmath65100 km s@xmath9 ( e.g. @xcite ) .    finally , we measured the sizes of r2 - 57 and r3 - 84 using the ruler option in the image viewing program _",
    "ds9_. the sizes were measured in all three bandpasses .",
    "the h@xmath0 sizes were 8.8@xmath5 and 6.6@xmath5 respectively .",
    "the [ s ii ] sizes were 8.4@xmath5 and 6.4@xmath5 respectively , and the [ o iii ] sizes were 8.8@xmath5 and 6.2@xmath5 , respectively . combining these measurements yields optical sizes of 8.7@xmath660.2 ( 33@xmath301 pc ) and 6.4@xmath660.2 ( 24@xmath301 pc ) , respectively .",
    "these sizes were used to calculate our age and density estimates in   [ multiprops ] .",
    "unfortunately the most sensitive radio data available has insufficient resolution and/or sensitivity to obtain more detailed morphologies than the deconvolved sizes .",
    "the deconvolved size of r2 - 57 at 20 cm is 4.3@xmath662.8 , and @xmath410@xmath669 at 6 cm .",
    "because r2 - 57 has been detected at two different wavelengths ( 20 and 6 cm ) with similar ( @xmath67)-coverage , a radio spectral index could be obtained from the integrated flux densities , about 0.25@xmath300.09 and 0.24@xmath300.22 mjy at 20 and 6 cm , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , a spectral index taken from such measurements would be unreliable considering the large errors .",
    "these large errors are attributable to the weakness of the signals as well as the ( unreliable ) correction factor for r2 - 57 at 6 cm due to loss of sensitivity near the half - power point of the antennas .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that the radio spectral index for r2 - 57 is not inconsistent with average spectral indices of snrs .    in the 20 cm vla archive data we measured an integrated flux density of 1.2@xmath300.2 mjy and deconvolved size of 8.6@xmath661.5 for r3 - 84 . in the 20 cm",
    "high - resolution archival data , a point source of 0.8 mjy is seen coincident with the brightest region in the lower - resolution data . because r3 - 84 is too far away from the phase center in the 6 cm data sets to be detected , we are unable to comment on a spectral index for this source .      the similar size measurements for these snrs at x - ray , optical , and radio wavelengths suggests at first that these snrs have similar morphologies at all wavelengths .",
    "however , in the case of r2 - 57 , the brightest region in all three optical wavelengths is the eastern rim , while the brightest regions in the radio and x - ray images are the north - northeast and northwest parts of the snr , respectively . even with this low - count x - ray detection , we can begin to learn about the multi - wavelength structure of this snr .",
    "although the low spatial resolution of the deep radio data limits detailed morphological comparison with the shorter wavelengths , the deconvolved sizes of the snrs provide some interesting comparisons .",
    "the sizes are all consistent within the errors , but the size of r2 - 57 at 20 cm may be about half the size at 6 cm . if there is a real size difference , we attribute it as likely due to strong 20 cm radiation originating in different areas of the snr than the 6 cm radiation .",
    "the small scale 20 cm structure seen in r3 - 84 ( see figure  [ r384r ] ) hints that this hypothesis is reasonable by showing how these snrs can have some complex structures at radio wavelengths .",
    "the morphology of r3 - 84 appears to be more consistent across all wavelengths .",
    "while r3 - 84 is too far off axis and has too few counts to say anything detailed about its x - ray morphology , there is a hint that the northwest portion of the snr is the brightest region in x - rays .",
    "this hint is consistent with the optical snr , which is brightest in the northwest portion in all 3 narrow - band images .",
    "in addition , our high - resolution 20 cm data , shown in figure  [ r384r ] , reveal that the northwest rim of the snr houses the brightest radio region , consistent with the x - ray / optical shell .",
    "the deconvolved size of r3 - 84 is consistent with the @xmath410.0@xmath68 size given by braun ( 1990 ) and the 8@xmath5 circles shown in figure  [ r384 ] .",
    "this extended emission is not detected in the 1@xmath5 resolution data because the noise level in the high - resolution data ( @xmath40.1 mjy / beam ) is too high . if the 1.2 mjy source detected in the 20 cm low resolution vla archive data is homogeneously spread over the 8@xmath5 disk , then the average surface flux density would be @xmath40.04 mjy / beam in a 1.4@xmath5 beam",
    ". such emission would be below the noise of the high - resolution data .",
    "the radio counterpart of this snr is comprised of a @xmath410@xmath5 shell with a bright region in the northwestern portion .",
    "therefore , the morphology of this snr , unlike that of r2 - 57 , appears quite similar at all wavelengths .",
    "as the measured sizes of the snrs are consistent across all of the observed wavelengths , we can use the sizes and measured temperatures to approximate the ages using the sedov solution as done in @xcite .",
    "we assume the snrs are in the adiabatic expansion phase .",
    "we adopt radii of 17@xmath301 pc ( r2 - 57 ) and 12@xmath301 pc ( r3 - 84 ) and shock temperatures of @xmath69  kev ( r2 - 57 ) and @xmath70 kev ( r3 - 84 ) .",
    "we assume an initial explosion energy of @xmath71 ( in units of 10@xmath72 erg s@xmath9 ) for both snrs .",
    "this value of @xmath73 is the average value from a sample of m31 snrs surveyed by spectroscopic observations , bracketed by the range of measured @xmath73 values , ignoring the highest and lowest values @xcite . from equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of @xcite",
    ", we obtain an age estimate of @xmath74  kyr and a density estimate of @xmath75  @xmath42 for r2 - 57 . applying the same calculations to r3 - 84 yields an age estimate of 9@xmath1  kyr and a density estimate of @xmath76  @xmath42 .",
    "by comparing _ chandra _",
    "acis - s images with local group survey [ o  iii ] images , we have discovered 2 new x - ray / optical / radio snrs in m31 .",
    "both of these objects are previously - cataloged x - ray sources .",
    "one is a previously - cataloged radio source , and the other is a newly - discovered radio counterpart discovered in our study .",
    "one snr ( r2 - 57 ) is well resolved in the x - ray images ; the other is marginally resolved .",
    "these snrs have emission - line ratios , x - ray spectra , and sizes typical of other snrs in m31 .",
    "the temperatures and sizes of the snrs provide age estimates of @xmath74  kyr ( r2 - 57 ) and 9@xmath1  kyr ( r3 - 84 ) .",
    "while these relatively weak x - ray detections have been crucial for the discovery of resolved x - ray snrs in m31 , they have only begun to allow studies of the multi - wavelength structure of these objects . with a total of 5 snrs resolved by _",
    "chandra _ in x - rays so far , it seems clear that , as deeper x - ray data become available , more of these objects are likely to be discovered and more detailed multi - wavelength morphological and spectral studies can be performed .",
