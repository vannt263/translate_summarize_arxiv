    "it is well known that a number of irregular scalar experimental signals have features of low dimensional ( low - d ) chaos .",
    "these signals often correspond to a spatial average over internal degrees of freedom of a spatially extended system . in such cases , while the internal degrees of freedom are not accessible to experiments , they are suspected to be spatio - temporally chaotic , a view supported by models that capture the basic features of the phenomenon .",
    "a good example is the plastic deformation of metallic alloys subjected to a constant strain rate test . here",
    ", only stress can be measured by the load cell placed at one end of the sample and is the spatial average of dislocation activity in the sample . under specific conditions ,",
    "the measured stress - time series , @xmath0 , exhibits irregular serrations @xcite .",
    "such stress signals have been shown to be low - d chaotic @xcite .",
    "a second example is the crackling audible noise , called acoustic emission ( ae ) commonly experienced during peeling of an adhesive tape .",
    "the ae signals have also been shown to be low - d chaotic @xcite , which is controlled by the rugged nature of the peel front .",
    "these two examples suggest that spatial averaging some how projects low - dimensional chaos out of spatio - temporal dynamics .",
    "several candidates for low - d chaos could be cited , including the irregular voltage fluctuations measured across a sample of a charge density wave compound ( cdw ) , attributed to pinning and unpinning of cdw @xcite , and the fluctuations in the position and intensity of a light beam passing through a turbulent medium @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the possibility of projecting low - d chaos from a spatiotemporal chaotic system and if so , under what conditions ?",
    "this question will be addressed within the context of a model for a plastic instability , called the portevin - le chatelier ( plc ) effect @xcite . the plc effect or jerky flow refers to the irregular stress - strain curves associated with the observed heterogeneous deformation when specimens of dilute metallic alloys are deformed in a window of strain rates and temperatures .",
    "while dislocation activity in the sample is not accessible to experiments , dislocation bands seen on the surface of the sample @xcite , measurement of acoustic emission studies @xcite , and studies on micro - crystals @xcite , strongly suggest that dislocation dynamics is intermittent .",
    "however , relating the irregular nature of the scalar signal to the dislocation dynamics has remained a difficult task due to lack of dislocation based models even though there is a general consensus that dislocation dynamics is intermittent , a view supported by dislocation dynamics simulations as well @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism attributed to the stress serrations in the plc effect is the collective pinning and unpinning of dislocations @xcite .",
    "each stress drop is associated with the formation and often the propagation of dislocation bands .",
    "three distinct types of dislocation bands , namely , the static uncorrelated type c , hopping type b and continuously propagating type a are seen with increasing strain rate .",
    "the average stress drop size is large for the type c band , decreasing with increasing strain rate as we encounter the type b and a bands @xcite .",
    "several of these generic features of the plc effect are captured by the ananthakrishna ( ak ) model @xcite .",
    "one prediction specific to the model relevant for the current study is the ( low - d ) chaotic nature of the stress drops for low strain rates @xcite .",
    "the prediction has been subsequently verified using experimental signals from single and polycrystals @xcite .",
    "thus , the model provides a platform to verify the conjuncture that the stress signals are low - d chaotic while the model equations are spatiotemporally chaotic . using the ak model , we show that at low strain rates , the irregular stress - time series can be unambiguously identified as low - d chaotic while the model equations are spatiotemporally chaotic .",
    "we show that the low - d chaotic nature is entirely due to the one - to - one correspondence between the isolated bursts of mobile density and the stress drops in this domain of applied strain rates .",
    "the low - d chaotic feature breaks down for higher applied strain rates which can be directly correlated with the propensity for the dislocation bands to propagate .",
    "the basic idea of the ak model is that most generic features of the plc effect such as the existence of the instability in a window of strain rates , the negative strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress , and the three types of bands ( c , b , and a ) emerge from the nonlinear interaction of a few dislocation populations assumed to represent the collective degrees of freedom of the system @xcite .",
    "the model uses three types of dislocation densities : the fast mobile @xmath1 , the immobile @xmath2 , and the cottrell type @xmath3 corresponding to dislocations decorated by solute atoms @xcite .",
    "( the standard ak model equations take into account the hardening process that is relevant for describing the physical phenomenon @xcite . however , since we are concerned here with the spatiotemporal dynamics in a stationary situation , we ignore the hardening term that also helps to attain the stationary state faster . ) the scaled equations for the three densities and the scaled stress @xmath4 are given by @xmath5 = d[\\dot{\\epsilon}_a -\\dot{\\epsilon}_p].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ x - eqn ] ) , refers to the formation of dipoles and other dislocations locks , @xmath7 refers to the annihilation of a mobile dislocation with an immobile one , and @xmath8 represents the reactivation of the immobile dislocation due to stress or thermal activation .",
    "@xmath9 represents the immobilization of mobile dislocations due to aggregation of solute atoms to dislocations .",
    "once a mobile dislocation starts acquiring solute atoms we regard it as cottrell - type dislocation @xmath10 . as more and more solute atoms aggregate",
    ", they eventually stop , and are considered as immobile dislocations @xmath8 .",
    "this term then acts as a source term in eq .",
    "( [ z - eqn ] ) .",
    "@xmath11 represents the rate of multiplication of dislocations due to cross slip .",
    "this depends on the velocity of the mobile dislocations taken to be @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the velocity exponent . within the scope of the model ,",

    "the scaled constants , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 refer , respectively , to the concentration of solute atoms slowing down the mobile dislocation , the thermal and athermal reactivation of immobile dislocations , and the diffusion rate of solute atoms to the mobile dislocations .",
    "the drive parameter is the applied strain rate @xmath14 with respect to which the different types of bands and the associated serrations are observed .",

    ".    equations ( [ x - eqn]@xmath21[phi - eqn ] ) are discretized on a grid of @xmath22 points and solved using an adaptive step - size differential equation solver ( matlab  ode23  ) .",
    "the initial values for the densities are taken to be uniformly distributed along the sample .",
    "however , as the long - term evolution does not depend on the initial values , steady - state values have been used . as dislocation bands can not propagate into the grips , the boundary values @xmath23 and @xmath22 are taken to be two orders higher than @xmath24 .",

    "( [ x - eqn ] ) and ( [ phi - eqn ] ) more carefully .",
    "we first note that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the unscaled stress at time @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the yield stress . from eq .",
    "( [ x - eqn ] ) , it is clear that @xmath35 increases abruptly only when @xmath4 exceeds unity ( corresponding to the unscaled stress exceeding the yield stress ) or equivalently , there is a threshold for nucleation of an isolated burst of the mobile density @xmath35 .",
    "however , a stress drop can only occur when the space - averaged plastic strain rate @xmath36 exceeds the applied strain rate @xmath37 .",
    "as mentioned earlier the model reproduces all the three types of bands ( c , b , and a ) observed in experiments with increasing @xmath37 @xcite . for a range of low @xmath37 values from 20 to 50 ,",
    "randomly nucleated dislocation bands are seen in the form of isolated bursts of @xmath35 . from the above discussion , we know that an isolated burst of @xmath35 can only be nucleated if the scaled stress @xmath4 increases beyond unity . a typical space - time plot of the randomly nucleated bands is shown in fig .",
    "[ band40](a ) for @xmath38 .",
    "the corresponding stress - time curve is nearly regular as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ band40](b ) .",
    "furthermore , in this range of @xmath37 , usually a single burst of @xmath35 contributes to the total plastic strain rate @xmath36 as the magnitude of @xmath39 at other spatial locations is insignificant .",
    "this implies that whenever the space - averaged plastic strain rate overshoots the applied strain rate @xmath37 , a stress drop occurs [ see eq .",
    "( [ phi - eqn ] ) ] .",
    "thus , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the burst of mobile density @xmath35 and the stress drop .",
    "however , as we increase @xmath37 , a new burst of @xmath35 is formed even before the previous burst dies off giving the impression of hopping character ( type - b band ) .",
    "this is clear from the plot of the hopping - type partial propagating band shown in fig .",
    "[ band90](a ) for @xmath40 .",
    "this also means that the stress required to nucleate a fresh burst of @xmath35 ahead of the previous one even before it dies off , is less than that required to nucleate an isolated burst of @xmath35 .",
    "this in turn implies that the amplitude of the serrations would be smaller in regions where propagating bands are seen .",

    "here , we note that the burst time scale of @xmath39 is short and the spatial averaging process maps the burst time scale to the time scale of the stress drop . then , the one - to - one correspondence between the burst in @xmath35 and stress drop leads to the low - d chaotic character of the stress reflected in the constancy of @xmath81 for all but small length scales .",
    "however , in principle , the influence of higher fourier components on the zeroth fourier component must be reflected in some form .",
    "the effect of other degrees of freedom has been represented as noise to explain the generally increasing trend of the correlation dimension for small length scales in studies on coupled maps @xcite . indeed , the increasing trend of @xmath81 for small scales seen in fig .",
    "[ corrd25 ] is perhaps a reflection of the high - dimensional nature of the full system .",
    "now consider the lyapunov spectrum obtained from the two methods . the main contribution to the divergence of orbits of the full set of model equations comes from the @xmath39 and @xmath132 due to the large range of values while both @xmath8 and stress contribute minimally .",
    "in contrast , the contribution to the divergence of the orbits in the embedded space of @xmath29 comes mainly from the rapid changes occurring during stress drops .",
    "since the underlying mechanisms and magnitudes of the changes contributing to the lyapunov spectrum in the two cases are very different , the results are not necessarily mutually _",
    "inconsistent_.    we believe that projecting low - dimensional chaos from spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics should hold at least in situations where there is a one - to - one correspondence between the abrupt variation of a scalar time series ( which is some kind of average over spatial degrees of freedom ) and localized excitations of the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this could also arise due to synchronization of a certain region of spatial elements .",
    "attempts to verify this conjecture are underway .",
    "detailed investigations are in progress to understand the relationship between the stress signals and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the model equations , and quantifying stress signals for higher strain rates where partial propagating bands are seen .",
