    "cerium , the first of the lanthanide series ( rare earths ) with an inner 4f - electron exhibits a broad range of unusual electronic , magnetic and structural properties in the solid state @xcite .",
    "most intriguing is the transformation under pressure @xcite between two face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) phases called @xmath6-ce and @xmath7-ce . while @xmath6-ce is stable at room temperature ( @xmath8 ) and ambient pressure ( @xmath9 ) , it transforms to @xmath7-ce at @xmath10 gpa .",
    "this apparent isostructural phase transition @xmath11 is accompanied by a @xmath1215% volume reduction and a change in magnetism . while in the @xmath6-phase the magnetic susceptibility @xmath13 follows a curie weiss law which is attributed to the magnetic moment of the 4f - electron , it is a quasi @xmath8-independent in the @xmath7-phase and reminiscent of pauli paramagnetism @xcite .",
    "the isostructural nature of the @xmath11 transition is at variance with the landau theory of phase transitions @xcite which would require a change of space group symmetry . since the establishing of the fcc structure for both phases @xcite various microscopic theories have been proposed . nowadays",
    "two theoretical models are well represented in the literature .",
    "a mott - transition scenario for 4f - states is based on the concept of a localized non bonding state of the 4f - electron in @xmath6-ce and an extended metallic bonding state in the @xmath7-phase @xcite .",
    "the increased binding capability due to the metallic f state is considered then as the reason for the marked volume reduction in the @xmath7-phase @xcite . in",
    "the following this model has been supported by band structure calculations @xcite . on the other hand",
    "more recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments on @xmath7-ce found that the magnetic form factor is quite different @xcite from the one calculated @xcite under the assumption that the 4f states are itinerant .",
    "the absence of extended 4f states in the solid is also supported by many - electron calculations on the ce dimer @xcite where it is found that the 4f - electrons do not participate in the chemical bond .",
    "the second widely recognized theoretical model is based on spin fluctuations .",
    "these are the driving mechanism in the kondo - volume - collapse ( kvc ) model of the @xmath11 transition @xcite . in first approximation",
    "the 4f - electron stays localized in both phases .",
    "however in the @xmath7-phase the hybridization between the 4f - electrons and the conduction electrons ( anderson impurity hamiltonian , see e.g. ref . )",
    "is much more intense than in the @xmath6-phase .",
    "this interaction leads to a screening of the 4f local moments in the energy ground state .",
    "the volume dependence of the hybridization coupling or equivalently of the kondo - temperature @xmath14 is used to obtain the equation of state .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath11 transition in ce within the kvc scenario @xcite has found strong support by the analysis of electron spectroscopy data @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding much effort , both the mott transition and the kvc model remain under debate @xcite and there is no consensus on the driving mechanism of the phase transition @xcite . a common feature is the absence of any symmetry breaking at the transition as would be required by landau theory @xcite . on the basis of thermodynamical data it has been suggested @xcite that the @xmath11 transformation is in fact a first order phase transition which becomes of second order beyond a tricritical point .",
    "therefore , @xmath7-ce should have lower symmetry than @xmath6-ce .",
    "however a distorted lattice has been discarded by x - ray diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "a mechanism of symmetry lowering without lattice distortion ( positions of the ce nuclei fcc in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 phase ) has been suggested by the present authors @xcite .",
    "the main concepts are the support of quadrupolar electronic charge - density fluctuations by the 4f - electrons in the @xmath6-phase on a compressible fcc lattice and the collective orientational ordering of the quadrupolar densities in the @xmath7 phase @xcite on four simple cubic ( sc ) sublattices .",
    "the space group symmetry lowering at the transition @xmath11 is @xmath0 , the local density symmetry is @xmath15 .",
    "it is accompanied by a uniform lattice contraction so that the fcc structure is conserved .",
    "although this latter aspect is  isostructural \" , the symmetry lowering of the electronic structure is fully consistent with landau theory . in reciprocal space",
    "the active electronic density mode condenses at the @xmath16 point of the brillouin zone .",
    "a phase transition @xmath0 occurs in solid c@xmath5 ( fullerite ) @xcite . here",
    "the symmetry lowering is due to the orientational ordering of the c@xmath5 molecules . at the transition",
    "the cubic lattice constant contracts discontinuously @xcite , the center of mass points of the molecules still occupy an fcc lattice . from the latter point of view , the phase transition would be  isostructural \" .",
    "however , the molecular order on four sc sublattices entails an order of the constituent c atoms and hence the @xmath2 structure leads to characteristic reflections in x - ray @xcite and neutron scattering @xcite experiments .",
    "the problem of measuring the @xmath2 structure directly in ce is complicated by the fact that the ce nuclei remain on an fcc lattice .",
    "although the quadrupolar charge density ordering could be detectable by synchrotron radiation , the intensity of the additional @xmath2 reflections is likely to be too weak and has not yet been uncovered @xcite . on the other hand",
    "there have been two recent experimental results which are very specific and point to the relevance of the quadrupolar ordering at the @xmath11 transition .",
    "time - differential perturbed angular correlation ( tdpac ) experiments in solid ce in a pressure range up to 8 gpa detect an appreciable electric field gradient ( efg ) in @xmath7-ce which is almost four times larger than in the cubic @xmath6 phase and close to values in the noncubic phases @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this finding rules out the @xmath19 symmetry in @xmath7-ce and evidences in support of the antiferroquadrupolar order suggested by theory @xcite .",
    "the other experimental support of the antiferroquadrupolar ordering is more indirect but very specific too .",
    "phonon dispersion measurements by inelastic x - ray scattering on elemental ce across the @xmath11 transition reveal strong changes in the dispersion shape @xcite .",
    "in particular a pronounced softening of certain phonon branches is found in the @xmath7-phase toward the @xmath16 point of the brillouin zone .",
    "given the above mentioned fact that the discussion on the validity of the mott transition or kvc scenario remains open , there have been in the last decade increased experimental efforts in investigating the lattice dynamics at the phase transition @xmath11 @xcite . from these studies",
    "it results that the lattice vibrations play an important role at the @xmath11 phase transition and that the inclusion of lattice dynamics in the theoretical description is of paramount importance . in this respect",
    "we recall that anomalous elastic behavior at the @xmath11 transition was originally discovered in ultrasound experiments @xcite . from inelastic neutron scattering experiments",
    "@xcite performed on single crystal of @xmath6-ce it was concluded that premonitory effect of the @xmath20 transition are present in the phonon dispersion curves of @xmath6-ce at room temperature .",
    "however , until recently the relevance of these results has not been sufficiently appreciated , while all research efforts were concentrated on the electronic properties .",
    "the anomalies of the elastic properties at the @xmath11 transition in ce [ 34,21,33 ] have their counterpart at the fcc@xmath21sc transition in c@xmath5 fullerite @xcite .",
    "in particular there is a striking resemblance of the pressure dependence of the bulk modulus in ce with corresponding experimental results in c@xmath5 @xcite .",

    "<S> starting from a model of 4f - electron generated quadrupolar densities on a compressible fcc lattice , the elastic anomalies at the @xmath0 phase transition are studied by means of analytical theory . </S>",
    "<S> the model is taken as representative for the @xmath1 phase transition in ce . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the ( linear ) lattice displacements to the square of the quadrupolar orientational density fluctuations renormalizes the elastic constants . </S>",
    "<S> the condensation of the quadrupolar densities into the orientationally ordered @xmath2 structure is studied as function of temperature and pressure . </S>",
    "<S> precursor effects of the transition lead to an anomalous softening of the elastic constant @xmath3 while @xmath4 exhibits no such softening . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results are in excellent qualitative agreement with pressure experiments on the elastic constants ( equivalently on sound velocities ) at the @xmath1 transition in ce . </S>",
    "<S> lattice dynamical analogies in theory and striking similarities in experimental results with the @xmath0 transition in c@xmath5 fullerite are discussed . </S>"
