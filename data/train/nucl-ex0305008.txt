    "the absence of a net suppression of @xmath2 for @xmath5 from 1.83.5 gev / c in central au+au collisions could also indicate the presence of dynamics beyond the framework of parton energy loss followed by fragmentation . the stronger dependence on centrality ( and thus parton density ) for baryon production indicated by the larger @xmath6",
