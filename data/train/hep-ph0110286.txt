    "contact interaction lagrangians ( ci ) generally represent an effective description of the ` low energy ' manifestations of some non - standard dynamics acting at new , intrinsic , mass scales much higher than the energies reachable at current particle accelerators . as such , they can be studied through deviations of the experimental observables from the standard model ( sm ) expectation , that reflect the additional presence of the above - mentioned new interaction .",
    "typical examples are the composite models and the exchanges of extremely heavy neutral gauge bosons and leptoquarks @xcite .",
    "clearly , such deviations are expected to be extremely small , as they would be suppressed for dimensional reasons by essentially some power of the ratio between the available energy and the large mass scales .",
    "accordingly , very high energy reactions in experiments with high luminosity are one of the natural tools to investigate signatures of contact interaction couplings . in general , these constants are considered as _ a priori _ free parameters , and one can quantitatively derive an assessment of the attainable reach and of the corresponding upper limits , essentially by numerically comparing the deviations with the expected experimental statistical and systematical uncertainties on the cross sections .    here",
    ", we consider the muon pair production process @xmath3 at a linear collider ( lc ) with c.m .",
    "energy @xmath4 and polarized electron and positron beams .",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of this reaction to the general , @xmath5 symmetric @xmath6 contact - interaction effective lagrangian , with helicity - conserving and flavor - diagonal fermion currents @xcite : @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) : @xmath8 denote left- or right - handed helicities , generation and color indices have been suppressed , and the ci coupling constants are parameterized in terms of corresponding mass scales as @xmath9 with @xmath10 depending on the chiral structure of the individual interactions . also , conventionally",
    "the value of @xmath11 is fixed at @xmath12 , as a reminder that , in the case of compositeness , the new interaction would become strong at @xmath13 of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "obviously , in this parameterization , exclusion ranges or upper limits on the ci couplings can be equivalently expressed as exclusion ranges or lower bounds on the corresponding mass scales @xmath14 .    for a given final lepton flavour @xmath15 , @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) envisages the existence of eight individual , and independent , ci models corresponding to the combinations of the four chiralities @xmath17 with the @xmath18 signs of the @xmath19 s , with a priori free , and nonvanishing , coefficients .",
    "correspondingly , the most general ( and model - independent ) analysis of the process ( [ proc ] ) must account for the complicated situation where all four - fermion effective couplings defined in eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) are simultaneously allowed in the expression for the cross section , and in principle can interfere and weaken the bounds in case of accidental cancellations .    of course , the different helicity amplitudes , as such , do not interfere",
    ". however , _ the deviations from the sm _ could be positive for one helicity amplitude , and negative for another .",
    "thus , cancellations might occur .",
    "the simplest attitude is to assume non - zero values for only one of the couplings ( or one specific combination of them ) at a time , with all others zero , this leads to tests of the specific models mentioned above .",
    "but , in principle , constraints obtained by simultaneously including couplings of different chiralities might become considerably weaker .",
    "therefore , it should be higly desirable to apply a more general ( and model - independent ) approach to the analysis of experimental data , that simultaneously includes all terms of eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) as independent free parameters , and can also allow the derivation of separate constraints ( or exclusion regions ) on the values of the coupling constants .    to this aim , in the case of the process ( [ proc ] ) at the lc considered here ,",
    "a possibility is offered by initial beam polarization , that enables us to extract from the data the individual helicity cross sections through the definition of particular , and optimal , polarized integrated cross sections and , consequently , to disentangle the constraints on the corresponding ci constants @xcite@xcite . in this note , we wish to to present a model - independent analysis of the ci that complements that of refs .",

    "in this regard , indirect manifestations of the ci interaction ( [ lagra ] ) can be looked for , _ via _ deviations of the measured observables from the sm predictions , caused by the new interaction .",
    "the reach on the ci couplings , and the corresponding constraints on their allowed values in the case of no effect observed , can be estimated by comparing the expression of the mentioned deviations with the expected experimental ( statistical and systematic ) uncertainties .    to this purpose , assuming the data to be well described by the sm ( @xmath87 ) predictions , i.e. , that no deviation is observed within the foreseen experimental uncertainty , and in the linear approximation in @xmath31 of the observables ( [ unpol])([alrfbth ] ) , we apply the method based on the covariance matrix : @xmath88 here , the @xmath89 are given by eq .",

    "the quadratic form ( [ chi2 ] ) defines a four - dimensional ellipsoid in the @xmath111 parameter space .",
    "the matrix @xmath112 has the property that the square roots of the individual diagonal matrix elements , @xmath113 , determine the projection of the ellipsoid onto the corresponding @xmath114-parameter axis in the four - dimensional space , and has the meaning of the bound at 95% c.l . on that parameter",
    "regardless of the values assumed for the others .",
    "conversely , @xmath115 determines the value of the intersection of the ellipsoid with the corresponding @xmath114-parameter axis , and represents the 95% c.l . bound on that parameter assuming all the others to be exactly known .",

    "such model - independent limits are listed as lower bounds on the mass scales @xmath14 in table  1 .",
    "all the numerical results exhibited in table  1 can be represented graphically . in fig .  1 we show the planar ellipses that are obtained by projecting onto the six planes ( @xmath116 ) , ( @xmath117 ) , ( @xmath118 ) , ( @xmath119 ) , ( @xmath120 ) , ( @xmath121 ) the 95% c.l .",

    "( [ unpol ] ) and ( [ afbth ] ) . therefore , by themselves , the pair of experimental observables @xmath96 and @xmath92 are not able to limit separately the ci couplings within finite ranges , but could only provide a constraint among the _ linear combinations _ of parameters @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in some planes , specifically in the ( @xmath128 and @xmath129 planes , this constraint has the form of ( unlimited ) bands of allowed values , or correlations , such as those limited by the straight lines in fig .  1 . with initial beam polarization , two more physical observables become available , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and this enables us to close the bands into the ellipses in fig .",
    "the allowed bounds obtained from the observables @xmath96 and @xmath92 are not affected by electron polarization ( for unpolarized positrons ) .",
    "therefore , the bounds in the form of straight lines are tangential to the outer ellipses referring to @xmath130 , and in this case the role of @xmath131 is just to close the corresponding band to a finite area .    the crosses in fig .  1 represent the constraints obtainable by taking only one non - zero parameter at a time , instead of all four simultaneously non - zero , and independent , as in the analysis discussed here .",
    "similar to the inner and outer ellipses , the shorter and longer arms of the crosses refer to positron polarization @xmath122 and 0.0 , respectively .",
    "such ` one - parameter ' results are derived from a @xmath132 procedure applied to the combination of the four physical observables ( [ unpol])([alrfbth ] ) , also taking the above - mentioned correlations among observables into account .",
    "this procedure leads to results numerically consistent with those presented from essentially the same set of observables in ref .",
    "@xcite , if applied to the same experimental inputs used there .    for comparison",
    ", we also show in table  1 the corresponding limits obtained in the case of polarized bhabha scattering @xcite .",
    "the table shows that for @xmath133 and @xmath134 the restrictions from @xmath0 and @xmath135 are qualitatively comparable .",
    "instead , the sensitivity to @xmath136 , and the corresponding lower bound , is dramatically higher in the case of bhabha scattering . in this regard , this is the consequence of the initial beams longitudinal polarization that allows , by measuring suitable combinations of polarized cross sections , to directly disentangle the coupling @xmath137 . indeed , without polarization , in general only correlations among couplings , rather that finite allowed regions , could be derived .",
