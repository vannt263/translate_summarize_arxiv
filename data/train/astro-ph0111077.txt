    "recently , different ways to determine the baryonic density of the universe have been exploited . here",
    ", we use the usual notations where @xmath5  denotes the ratio of the baryon density over the critical density of the universe , and @xmath6 is the baryon over photon ratio .",
    "they are related by @xmath3=3.65@xmath7 with @xmath8 the hubble constant in units of 100  km@xmath9s@xmath10@xmath9mpc@xmath10 .",
    "it is now possible to confront the results of these different approaches to test the validity of the underlying model hypothesis and hopefully obtain a better evaluation of this crucial cosmological parameter .",
    "three independent methods have been used so far to derive the baryon density of the universe , _",
    "i ) _ the pioneering one , ( standard ) big - bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , based on nuclear physics in the early universe , _ ii ) _ very recently , the study of the cosmic microwave radiation ( cmb ) anisotropies and _ iii ) _ the census of h ( and also he@xmath11 ) atomic lines from the lyman@xmath4  forest at high redshift .    regarding",
    "the uncertainties attached to each of these methods , those related to sbbn are probably the best controlled .",
    "standard bbn depends essentially on one parameter , @xmath6 , the baryon to photon ratio since the number of light neutrinos is essentially known .",
    "this model , in its standard version , has survived for many decades showing its robustness .",
    "it success in reproducing the light element ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2  and , ) primordial abundances over a span of 10 orders of magnitude is remarkable@xcite .",
    "the leading uncertainties come from the observations of the isotopes in different astrophysical sites and the way they are interpreted ( @xmath1  in particular ) to estimate the primordial abundances and the insufficient knowledge of some reaction rates .",
    "lithium suffers from two drawbacks _ i ) _ it is affected more than any other light isotope by uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates _ ii ) _ the valley shape in its abundance versus @xmath6 curve leads to two possible @xmath6 values for a given abundance .",
    "this shape is due to its production modes , by @xmath12+@xmath0  and @xmath2+@xmath0 , respectively at low and high baryonic density .",
    "the first difficulty could be reduced by a better determination of a few key cross sections , but the second one is intrinsic to the calculation .",
    "thus to remove the degeneracy on the baryon density , lithium should be associated to , at least , one other light element , deuterium for instance .",
    "however , the relation between ,  observations and its primordial abundance seems more straightforward than for @xmath1 .    in the case of the cmb ,",
    "the @xmath3  values deduced from observations tend to converge but their interpretations are probably still model dependent .",
    "the cmb analyses involve many parameters , principally the various energy densities ( @xmath13 , @xmath5 , @xmath14 , respectively the total density , baryonic density and the cosmological constant contribution ) , @xmath8 , the initial fluctuation spectrum index ( @xmath15 ) , the reionisation optical depth ( @xmath16 ) and the overall normalization .",
    "the baryon density is extracted from the amplitudes of the acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "it is important to note that the ratio of amplitudes between the first and second peaks increases with @xmath5 , in contrast with all other cosmological parameters .",
    "hence , the determination of @xmath3  does not suffer from the cosmic degeneracy that affects @xmath14 and @xmath17 and a high precision can be expected@xcite .",
    "however , these values are obtained in the framework of inflationary models that could be altered in other cosmological contexts@xcite .",
    "the third method is based on the study of the atomic hi and heii lyman@xmath4   absorption lines observed in the line of sight of quasars .",
    "quasars being the brightest objects of the universe , they can be observed at very large redshift . on their line of sight , atoms both in diffuse or condensed structures absorb part of their radiation , making absorption lines apparent .",
    "it allows in particular to study the intergalactic medium via the so - called lyman@xmath4  forest .",
    "this method leads to an estimate of the baryon content of the universe on large scales@xcite .",
    "indeed , the evaluation of @xmath3  through the study of the evolution of the lyman@xmath4  forest in the redshift range 0@xmath185 , though indirect because of the relatively large ionisation uncertainties , leads to results consistent with the two previous methods .    in the following ,",
    "we update the big bang nucleosynthesis calculations on the basis of the recent nacre compilation@xcite of reaction rates supplemented by other recent works@xcite .",
    "we performed monte ",
    "carlo calculations to estimate the uncertainties on light element yields arising from nuclear reactions alone .",
    "similar calculations have been performed recently , based on a different compilation and analysis of nuclear data ( nollett and burles@xcite , and cyburt et al.@xcite ) .",
    "however , here , we put the emphasis on ,  as its primordial abundance is more reliable than that of other light isotopes ( @xmath1  in particular ) .",
    "using ,  as the main _ baryometer _ one deduces @xmath3  and we compare it with _",
    "i ) _ with the helium and deuterium primordial abundances , _ ii ) _ other sbbn investigations and _ iii ) _ independent evaluations ( cmb and lyman@xmath4  forest ) .",
    "here we present the selection of astrophysical observations that we use for the determination of the baryon density of the universe from the sbbn calculation . to estimate primordial abundances ,",
    "observations are made on the oldest objects that are characterized by their high redshift @xmath19 or low _",
    "metallicity_.\\equiv\\log\\left(fe / h\\right)_{\\mathrm star}-\\log\\left(fe / h\\right)_\\odot$ ] is often used .",
    "for instance , @xmath20 $ ] = -2 corresponds to 1% of the solar ( @xmath21 ) metallicity .",
    "otherwise , @xmath22 or @xmath23 for instance , represent the ratio of abundances by number of atoms . ]    the determination of the primordial @xmath0  abundances is derived from observations of metal  poor , extragalactic , ionized hydrogen ( hii ) regions .",
    "this extraction is difficult to the level of precision required , due to the incomplete knowledge of the different atomic parameters involved .",
    "olive and skillman@xcite have studied in great detail the systematic uncertainties , and concluded that the typical errors given in previous studies are underestimated by a factor of about two .",
    "the extreme values published@xcite cover the range fom 0.231 to 0.246 ( in mass fraction ) , putting little constraint on models .",
    "consequently , in this work , @xmath0  will not be considered as a discriminating indicator of the baryonic density .",
    "deuterium is peculiar because , after bbn , this fragile isotope , can , in principle , only be destroyed in subsequent stellar or galactic nuclear processing .",
    "hence the primordial abundance should be represented by the _",
    "highest _ observed value .",
    "it is measured essentially in three astrophysical sites , _",
    "i ) _ in the local interstellar medium ( present value ) , _ ii ) _ in the protosolar cloud ( 4.6 gyr ago ) and _ iii ) _ in remote cosmological clouds on the line of sight of high redshift quasars ( large lookback time ) . in principle , the later sample ( _ iii ) _ should be the closest representative of the primordial @xmath1  value , but up to now , the observations lead to two ranges of @xmath1  abundance values .",
    "however , very recently , it has been shown@xcite that the @xmath1abundance on the line of sight of the qso  pg1718 + 4607 quasar can not be determined due to blending between the lyman@xmath4  and the main hydrogen absorption lines , contrary to a previous study@xcite .",
    "since this observation was the main evidence for a high @xmath22 value ( @xmath24 corresponding to a low @xmath6 range ; see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the very high primordial @xmath1  abundance seems to have lost its support and hence only one range of ( low ) @xmath22 values remains .",
    "however , the @xmath1  abundance data from cosmological clouds remain scarce and scattered ( fig .",
    "[ f : lid ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the extreme values deduced from the different observations@xcite lead to the interval @xmath25 ( including error bars ) .",
    "this dispersion ( amounting to a factor of about 3 ) , if physical and not observational , casts a doubt on the direct identification of the observed values with the primordial @xmath1  abundance .",
    "alternatively , it could indicate that this fragile isotope has already been processed in these high redshift clouds despite their low metallicity@xcite .",
    "thus , in this perspective , averaging the @xmath22 abundances measured in cosmological clouds to infer the primordial value seems somewhat inappropriate . in addition the observations of the absorbing cloud on the line of sight of qso  0347 - 3818 have been analyzed using two methods@xcite and lead to different values ( stars in fig .",
    "[ f : lid ] ) .",
    "this suggest that systematic errors may still be important .",
    "on the other hand , it has been shown@xcite that there exists a large dispersion in the local measurements ( @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) .",
    "this could indicate that unknown processes are at work to modify the @xmath1abundance at small scale in our galaxy .",
    "thus , if it is confirmed that local @xmath1  abundances are scattered as the result of yet unknown physical processes , the same thing could occur in absorbing clouds at large redshift .",
    "in addition , the lowest value obtained at high redshift@xcite ( @xmath22 = @xmath28 ) is uncomfortably close to both the solar system and interstellar ones ( respectively around @xmath29 and @xmath30@xcite ) . it is inconsistent with even the most conservative galactic evolution models since it would require a negligible @xmath1  destruction .",
    "note that this lowest value@xcite ( in parenthesis in fig .",
    "[ f : lid ] ) is affected by a large uncertainty concerning the level of the continuum and the blending of the relevant lines@xcite .",
    "if this questionable observation is put aside , a trend appears in the @xmath22 data versus metallicity @xmath31 $ ] ( fig .",
    "[ f : lid ] ) showing a @xmath1  abundance decreasing when metallicity increases , as qualitatively expected from stellar evolution@xcite .",
    "( to view the trend we do not consider the alternative analysis@xcite of qso  0347 - 3818 to be consistent with the analyses of the other observations . )",
    "accordingly , the true primordial @xmath22 value should be obtained from extrapolation to zero metallicity .",
    "consequently , even though , in principle @xmath1  better constrains @xmath6 than ,  ( u  shape of the curve ) , the value of its primordial abundance is still a matter of debate .",
    "we adopted the highest observed value@xcite in a cosmological cloud assuming that lower values are the result of subsequent processing .",
    "compared to @xmath1 , the determination of the ,  primordial abundance from observations leaves less room for interpretations . since the discovery of a plateau in the lithium abundance as a function of metallicity ( fig .",
    "[ f : lid ] , lower panel ) , drawn for metal poor dwarf stars@xcite , many new observations have strengthened its existence . the fact that the abundance does not increase with time ( metallicity ) at the surface of the oldest stars was interpreted as being representative of the primordial ,  abundance@xcite . as such , these measurements could have been affected by two processes _ i ) _ a production related to non thermal ( spallation ) nuclear reactions ( mainly @xmath32 ) in the interstellar medium , increasing the amount of lithium in forming stars at a given metallicity and _ ii ) _ a depletion in the envelope of these stars .",
    "the contribution of the first process is small at very low metallicity amounting typically to less than 10% at a metallicity @xmath20$]=-2@xcite . at @xmath20$]=-1 ,",
    "this contribution is more significant but remains within the dispersion of the data .",
    "the second one concerns the potential depletion of lithium by nuclear destruction and possibly by diffusion and rotational mixing@xcite .",
    "the small scatter of the data , over three metallicity decades , on the one hand and the presence of the even more fragile @xmath33  isotope in a few halo stars ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) on the other hand , strongly limit the amount of possible depletion .",
    "hence , this effect should also be within the dispersion of the data .",
    "bonifacio and molaro@xcite have deduced from their large observational sample a primordial value : @xmath34 = -9.762@xmath350.012 ( statistic , 1@xmath36 ) @xmath350.05 ( systematic ) .",
    "more recently , ryan et al.@xcite , on the basis of their observations , have provided a new determination : @xmath23 = @xmath37 .",
    "their mean value and ( 95% confidence ) limits take into account all possible contributions from ,  depletion mechanisms and bias in analysis .",
    "but the main difference with the earlier work@xcite is that they have taken into account a slight rise of the lithium abundance due to spallation reaction leading to a smaller primordial abundance when extrapolated a zero metallicity .",
    "accordingly , we adopt their range for the primordial ,  abundance .",
    "cmb anisotropy measurements give independent estimates of the baryonic density of the universe .",
    "the first determinations of @xmath3  from boomerang and maxima @xcite yielded @xmath3@xmath380.03 .",
    "the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) , ground based , has given preliminary results in marked contrast@xcite ( @xmath3@xmath380.009 ) to boomerang / maxima values .",
    "the degree angular scale interferometer , dasi ( along with its sister instrument cbi)@xcite , is one of the new compact interferometers specifically built to observe the cmb . combined with the large angle measurements made by cobe , it has been able to reveal a significant signal in the second peak region and has determined @xmath3=0.022@xmath39 ( 1@xmath36 ) .",
    "recently , new analyses@xcite of boomerang data have also led to @xmath3  = 0.022@xmath39 ( 1@xmath36 ) .",
    "but the situation is not yet settled and a wealth of new data is expected from future ground instruments , long balloon flights and especially satellites ( map , planck  surveyor ) .    as mentioned above , the study of the baryon content of the intergalactic medium evolution of the lyman@xmath4  forest in the redshift range @xmath40 leads to an evaluation of @xmath3 .",
    "such analyses have lead to @xmath3@xmath410.0125@xcite and @xmath420.03 @xcite .",
    "hui et al.@xcite using recent observations@xcite have found @xmath3=0.03@xmath350.01 .",
    "these various results are summarized in table  [ t : ob ] , compared in fig .",
    "[ f : lik ] and discussed in sect.[s : res ] .",
    "most of the important reactions for ,  production ( table  [ t : reac ] ) are available in the nacre compilation of thermonuclear reaction rates@xcite .",
    "other reactions in our bbn network are adapted from an earlier compilation@xcite or more recent works@xcite . in our previous studies ,",
    "we have studied the influence of individual reactions@xcite or extreme yield limits@xcite obtained when considering all combinations of low and high rates . here , instead , we have performed monte - carlo calculations to obtain statistically better defined limits , as we did in a previous work@xcite that was limited to the nacre reactions . here",
    "we update these calculations by taking into account uncertainties on the remaining reactions . in the following , we discuss the origin of these calculated uncertainty limits .",
    "one of the main innovative features of nacre with respect to former compilations@xcite is that uncertainties are analyzed in detail and realistic lower and upper bounds for the rates are provided . using these low and high rate limits",
    ", it is thus possible to calculate the effect of nuclear uncertainties on the light element yields .",
    "recently , two other sbbn calculations have been performed : one based on the nollett and burles@xcite compilation ( hereafter nb ) and another on a partial reanalysis the nacre data by cyburt et al.@xcite ( hereafter cfo ) .",
    "the nb and nacre compilations differ in several aspects .",
    "the nb compilation addresses primordial nucleosynthesis while nacre is a general purpose compilation .",
    "consequently , nb contains a few more reactions of interest to bbn and a few more data in the energy range of interest . also , _ from the statistical point of view _ ,",
    "the rate uncertainties are better defined in nb , however the astrophysical @xmath43factors  factor is defined by @xmath44 where here @xmath6 @xmath45 is the sommerfeld parameter .",

    "are fitted by splines which have no physical justification and can produce local artifacts by following to closely experimental data points . on the contrary",
    ", the nacre compilation spans wider energy ranges , and over these ranges , the @xmath43factors are fitted to functions based on theoretical assumptions .",
    "[ f : dpg ] shows that outside of resonances a simple fit ( second order polynomial in this case ) is sufficient to account for @xmath382 orders of magnitude variation in @xmath43 . for the @xmath46 reaction , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the revised data of schmidt et al.@xcite ( sc96 in fig .  [",

    "the lower panel displays the ratio between the experimental and fitted @xmath43 values .",
    "the dispersion around unity is small and can hardly be considered physical .",
    "it should be noted that by using such a simple fit ( when permitted by theory ) , precise data points outside the range of bbn energy ( e.g. the high energy data point in this case ) helps constrain the fitted @xmath43factor in the region of interest ( @xmath470.1  mev in this case ) .",
    "this eliminates spurious local effects induced by a few erratic data points associated with experimental problems rather than a genuine physical effect .",

    "big bang nucleosynthesis has been the subject of permanent interest since it gives access to the baryon density which is a key cosmological parameter .",
