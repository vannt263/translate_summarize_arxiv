    "a key issue in modern astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and evolve , and the study of the stellar population and star formation history ( over a wide wavelength range ) may provide clues to the dominant mechanism .",
    "for example , two main scenarios are proposed to explain the formation of galaxies , one is the tidal torque theory , which suggests an initial collapse of gas at very high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and another is associated with galaxy mergers at intermediate to high redshifts ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "both produce distinct signatures in the resulting stellar populations .",
    "as we still can not access the light of individual stars in almost any galaxy beyond the local group , the way widely used is to study the stellar populations by the integrated light of the whole galaxy or a significant fraction of it , by means of long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "the usual approaches for studying unresolved stellar populations are either by means of empirical population synthesis @xcite or evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) models @xcite , as well as a combination of both techniques @xcite . by using them",
    ", we can infer the age and metallicity distributions of the stellar populations that make up a galaxy s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the study of unresolved stellar populations in galaxies , ranging from star - forming to ellipticals , as well as in composite objects and active galaxies , is a common approach in the near - uv ( nuv ) and optical bands @xcite . on the other hand , addressing unresolved stellar populations in the near infrared ( nir ) is less common , starting @xmath23 decades ago ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , but which seems to be in increasing expansion @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite have shown that using different eps models in the optical leads to different stellar population results .",
    "so , it is not reasonable to directly compare stellar populations estimated from different eps models .",
    "they suggest that to get reliable results , one should use the same eps models to compare different samples . as related issues , can one compare the light - fraction results derived , with the same base of elements , in one spectral region to another ?",
    "are the population fractions derived in the optical the same in the nuv / nir ? what is the effect of the normalisation point used in the synthesis ?",
    "does the choice of elements that compose the base ( i.e. age , metallicity and initial mass function - imf ) produce different results along the whole spectrum ?",
    "the answer to the above questions would be easy * if stellar population synthesis were based on * a more physical parameter , like mass - fractions .",
    "however , given the non - constant stellar mass - to - light ( @xmath3 ) ratio , mass - fractions have a much less direct relation with the observables than light - fractions .",
    "in this context , we feel motivated to carry out a detailed study of the panchromatic averaged stellar population ( ) components over the 3500  to 2.5  spectral region , commonly used for stellar population synthesis .",
    "* it should be clear that  is not a tool for performing stellar population synthesis .",

    "in this section we describe the eps models used in what follows .",
    "the four models : grasil , galev , maraston and galaxev , have been selected because they have a spectral coverage from the nuv to the nir region ( @xmath23500  - 2.5 ) and are widely used . a brief description of them is made below .",
    "details can be found in the original papers cited below , as well as in @xcite .",
    "the graphite and silicate - grasil - code , developed by @xcite , is a chemical evolution code that follows the star formation rate , metallicity and gas fraction , which are basic ingredients for stellar population synthesis .",
    "the latter is performed with a grid of integrated spectra of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) of different ages and metallicities , in which the effects of dusty envelopes around asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are included , but not the agb energetics @xcite . the models consider four initial mass functions ( imfs ) , @xcite .",
    "@xcite atmosphere models , for population synthesis , and padova tracks @xcite are also considered .",
    "moreover , ssps of grasil cover a spectral range from 91  up to 1200 .",
    "further details can be found in laura silva phd thesis .",
    "the galaxy evolution - galev - evolutionary synthesis models describe the evolution of stellar populations in general , from star clusters to galaxies , both in terms of resolved stellar populations and integrated light properties @xcite . according to the authors",
    ", the code considers both the chemical evolution of the gas and the spectral evolution of the stellar component , allowing for a chemically consistent approach .",
    "thus , some ssps provided by galev show a emission line spectra .",
    "the ssp models provided by galev cover 5 metallicities and 4000 ages ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "they are based on the spectra from basel spectral library @xcite , originally based on the @xcite library .",
    "they also have 3 different imfs @xcite and use the theoretical isochrones from the padova team ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the wavelength coverage spans the range from 90  to 160 , with a spectral resolution of 20  in the nuv - optical , and 50 - 100  in the nir .",
    "they also include the thermally- pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase provided by the padova tracks @xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning at this point that the tp - agb stars account for 25 to 40% of the bolometric light of an ssp , and for 40 to 60% of the light emitted in the k - band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we combine two components : 13gry ( the old population ) and one of the other ssps representing the  young \" population .",
    "the combination was made by summing up , along the whole spectral range ( @xmath23500  to 2.5 ) , increasing fractions of the  young \" component from 1 to 100% , according to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fractional flux , which we vary in steps of 0.01 , @xmath13 is the flux of spectrum of the  young \" component , for each @xmath14 between @xmath23500  to 2.5 , normalised to unity at 5870  for the optical , or at 1.223  for the nir , and @xmath15 is the flux of the 13gyr spectrum also normalised at the same points .",
    "note that the normalisation of the spectra is done by dividing their fluxes by that of the normalisation point ( 5870  or 1.223 ) , after the computations are done .",
    "in addition , by normalising the spectra we are dealing with light - fractions , which are directly related to the observations .",
    "@xmath16 is the resulting flux of the combined ssps ( young + old ) at a specific @xmath14 .",
    "the averaged stellar population components spread over all  were derived by : @xmath17    eq.[eqfrac ] represents the young and old light fractions for different , this is what we call fraction at @xmath14 .",
    "the result of such process is summarised in figs .",

    "we show the sum of a  young \" component with a 13gyr ssp ( the old component ) in steps of 10% . in practice",
    "we start with 5% of the flux of the  young \" ssp + 95% of the flux of the 13gyr ssp , and finish with 95% of the young + 5% of the old component .",
    "this procedure is done over all @xmath14s between the nuv and nir .",
    "it is worth mentioning that figs .",
    "[ fractionsopt ] and [ fractionsnir ] , show m05 eps models as reference ( sec .  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "these figures suggest that one can not directly compare the light fractions of the young component ( @xmath0 400 myrs ) derived in the optical with those obtained in the nir , and vice versa ( i.e. 77% of the 5myr population at 3800  represents only 5% at 1.223 ) .",
    "however , the intermediate to old components ( @xmath1 500 myrs ) can be directly compared between different wavelengths .",

    ", we combined three population vectors according to :    @xmath21    where , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fractional fluxes from 0% to 100% , which are varied in steps of 1% ; @xmath13 , @xmath25 and @xmath15 are the normalised fluxes ( at @xmath14=5870  or @xmath14 1.223 ) of the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 population vectors , respectively .",

    "[ eqfrac ] : @xmath30    we show the result of such combination in figs .  [ 3compsnira ] to [ 3compsnirc ] .",
    "it is clear that even with three population vectors , the results derived in one wavelength are not the same as in other @xmath14s . in addition ,",
    "[ 3compsnirc ] reinforces the fact that in the case of only intermediate to old components , the population fractions derived in one wavelength are nearly the same as in other @xmath14s ( i.e. the values derived in the optical can be used in the nir ) .",
    "the determination of mean ages and metallicities of galaxies is important for models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the techniques for dating unresolved stellar populations in local galaxies have focused on colours or spectroscopic indices measured in the nuv and optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , even small mass fractions of young stars added to an old population can affect the nuv and optical age determinations significantly , making the galaxy appear young , which leads to a further degeneracy between mass fraction and age @xcite .",
    "these problems may be solved for intermediate - age stellar populations looking in nir wavelengths .",
    "in addition , the detection of young stellar populations in the nir requires a hard work @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fractionsnir ] that even a small fraction of a 5myr population ( @xmath2 5% ) detected in the nir may be responsible for almost all the light observed in the nuv ( @xmath2 70% ) .",
    "clearly , synthesis results should not be directly propagated from the nir to the nuv / optical , or vice versa . instead ,",
    "eqs .  [ eqfrac ] to  [ eqfrac3 ] should be used for this purpose . to help with such a comparison",
    "we have created an on - line form , the * pa*nchromatic * a*veraged * s*tellar * p*opulation : riffel / software.html ] and make available for download the tables with the results of the above equations ( see appendix  [ appen ] ) .    another important ingredient in stellar population fitting is the metallicities used .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the results of the fitting have a weaker dependence on metallicity than age .",
    "the question which arises here is , does metallicity affect the propagation of the averaged stellar populations ?",
    "we investigate this effect with m05 ssps with 3 different metallicities ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; and 2@xmath32 ) and the same age grid as in fig .",

    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ metalopt ] and [ metalnir ] .",
    "clearly the propagation of the contributions has a negligible dependence on metallicity .",
    "thus , one can use the condensed population vectors proposed by @xcite to propagate the fitting results over all @xmath14s .",
    "all the tests described above were made using the m05 models , but , as stated in sec .",
    "[ epsmodels ] , there are more eps models available in the literature covering simultaneously the spectral region between @xmath23500  and 2.5 .",
    "thus , it is necessary to test if the selection of eps models will produce different results in the propagation of the synthesis results over different @xmath14s . in fig .",
    "[ comparamodels ] we compare the different models among each other .",
    "it is clear that in the case of the optical normalisation point ( 5870 ) , the four models produce very similar results in the interval between 3800  and 9000 , but a discrepancy between galev / m05 and grasil / bc03 models is observed in the nir .",
    "such a discrepancy is due to the well known fact that galev and m05 models do include stars in the tp - agb phase ( see m05 , for example ) , which is more sensitive to the nir than the optical , i.e tp - agb stars account for 25 to 40% of the bolometric light of an ssp , and for 40 to 60% of the light emitted in the k - band ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , there is a difference between galev and m05 models , enhanced in the 100 myr population .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this discrepancy : one is associated with the different onset age of the tp - agb on the models . a high tp - agb contribution at 100myr , as applied by @xcite , which is excessively high when compared to young large magellanic cloud globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the other is associated with the way in which the tp - agb treatment is made @xcite .",
    "galev includes tp - agb by means of isochrones ( padova94 + improved tp - agb models * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while m05 is based on a different approach , the fuel consumption theorem .",
    "according to @xcite , the stellar luminosity during the evolutionary phases that follow or suffer from mass loss can not be predicted by stellar tracks , because there is no theory linking mass - loss rates to the basic stellar parameters , such as luminosity .",
    "note that the trend observed in fig .",
    "[ comparamodels ] can also be associated with the fact that in m05 models , the tp - agb contributes with 40% to the bolometric flux , and 80% to the k - band .",
    "this is higher than the  simpler \" calculations ( made by the padova group at the time ) used by @xcite , in which only some thermal pulses have been included @xcite .",
    "in addition , the tests were performed with the @xcite imf . to see the effect of the imf on the averaged stellar populations over all @xmath14s",
    ", we repeat the same exercises for different imfs and summarise the results in fig .",
    "this figure suggests that the imf does not play an important role in the synthesis propagation to other spectral regions .                  in order to test",
    "if we are able to predict the averaged stellar populations over all lambdas , extensive simulations were performed to evaluate the s ability to recover input parameters . in short ,",
    "we build artificial galaxy spectra by mixing @xcite solar metallicity ssp models of 5myr , 700myr and 13gyr in different proportions , and perform stellar population synthesis with normalisation points at the optical ( 5870 ) and nir ( 12230 ) . to this purpose",
    "we use the starlight code optimised to the optical region @xcite , and which also produces reliable results when applied to the nir spectral @xcite .    in summary",
    ", starlight fits an observed spectum @xmath33 with a combination , in different proportions , of @xmath34 ssps .",

    "<S> * we study how the spectral fitting of galaxies , in terms of light fractions derived in one spectral region translates into another region , by using results from evolutionary synthesis models . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we examine propagation dependencies on evolutionary population synthesis ( eps , grasil , galev , maraston and galaxev ) models , age , metallicity , and stellar evolution tracks over the near - uv  near infrared ( nuv  nir , 3500  to 2.5 ) spectral region . * our main results are : as expected , young ( @xmath0 400 myr ) stellar population fractions derived in the optical can not be directly compared to those derived in the nir , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , intermediate to old age ( @xmath1 500 myr ) fractions are similar over the whole spectral region studied . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity has a negligible effect on the propagation of the stellar population fractions derived from nuv  nir . </S>",
    "<S> the same applies to the different eps models , but restricted to the range between 3800   and 9000  . </S>",
    "<S> however , a discrepancy between galev / maraston and grasil / galaxev models occurs in the nir . also , the initial mass function ( imf ) is not important for the synthesis propagation . compared to starlight synthesis results , </S>",
    "<S> our propagation predictions agree at @xmath295% confidence level in the optical , and @xmath285% in the nir . </S>",
    "<S> * in summary , spectral fitting * performed in a restricted spectral range should not be directly propagated from the nir to the uv / optical , or vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> we provide equations and an on - line form ( * pa*nchromatic * a*veraged * s*tellar * p*opulation - ) to be used for this purpose .    infrared : stars  infrared : stellar population  galaxies  agb  post - agb . </S>"
