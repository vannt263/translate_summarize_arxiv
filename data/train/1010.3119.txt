    "what are the most perfect fluids in nature with the smallest shear viscosity ( @xmath3 ) per entropy density ( @xmath4 ) ?",
    "kovtun , son , and starinets  ( kss ) kovt1 suspected that they are a class of strongly interacting conformal field theories ( cfts ) whose @xmath5 .",
    "they even conjectured that @xmath6 is the minimum bound for @xmath0  for all physical systems .",
    "ever since the kss bound was proposed , much progress has been made in testing this bound and trying to identify the most perfect fluid ( see kapusta:2008vb , schafer:2009dj for recent reviews ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath7 can be as small as possible ( but still positive ) in a carefully engineered meson system @xcite , although the system is metastable .",
    "also , in strongly interacting cfts , the universal value @xmath5 is obtained only in the limit of infinite @xmath8 , with @xmath8 the size of the gauge group , and infinite thooft coupling limit @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 corrections can be negative , however , kats:2007mq , brigante:2007nu  and can modify the @xmath0 bound slightly @xcite .    in the real world",
    ", the smallest @xmath0 known so far belongs to a system of hot and dense matter thought to be quark gluon plasma just above the phase transition temperature produced at rhic @xcite  with @xmath10 luzum:2008cw .",
    "a robust upper limit @xmath11 was extracted by another group @xcite and a lattice computation of gluon plasma yields @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "progress has been made in cold unitary fermi gases as well .",
    "an analysis of the damping of collective oscillations gives @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "even smaller values of @xmath0 are indicated by recent data on the expansion of rotating clouds @xcite but more careful analyses are needed @xcite .",
    "previous studies have given some clues about where to find the most perfect fluid in nature .",
    "the first one is to study strongly interacting systems because strong interaction generally implies small @xmath0",
    ". the second clue can be found in a large class of systems where @xmath0 goes to a local minimum near the phase transition temperature ( @xmath14 ) csernai:2006zz , chen:2006iga , chen:2007jq . in particular , @xmath0 develops a cusp(jump ) at @xmath14 for a second(first ) order phase transition and a smooth local minimum for a cross over .",
    "this behavior is seen in qcd with zero baryon chemical potential @xcite and near the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite .",
    "it is also seen in cold unitary fermi gases @xcite , in h@xmath15o , n , and he and in all the matters with data available in the nist database webbook , csernai:2006zz , chen:2007xe .",
    "theoretically , these behaviors can be reproduced in controlled calculations of weakly interacting real scalar field theories @xcite .",
    "thus , it was speculated that this feature is universal .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then @xmath0 can be used to probe some parts of the systems which are hard to explore otherwise .",
    "for example , one can try to locate the critical point of qcd by measuring @xmath7 @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "however , we present a counterexample of the @xmath0 behavior speculated above . in this model , @xmath0 does not go to a local minimum at the second order phase transition temperature .",
    "our model is a mixture of two weakly self - interacting real scalar fields with one condensing at low temperatures while the other remains in the symmetric phase .",
    "there is no interaction between the two fields .",
    "the advantage of this model is that its @xmath0 can be computed reliably as in @xcite because of the small couplings @xcite .",
    "other counterexamples have been asserted previously in literature .",
    "one of them is a @xmath16 model calculation with a local minimum below @xmath14 @xcite . in this model ,",
    "large couplings are used to mimic the case of qcd .",
    "thus , it is not clear this is due to the failure of the boltzmann equation at large couplings @xcite , or if the effect is generic .",
    "also , holographic models have constant @xmath0 ( @xmath17 ) in the limit of infinite @xmath8 and the infinite t hooft coupling limit .",
    "if @xmath9 corrections are added , @xmath0 becomes monotonically increasing below @xmath14 and a constant above @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "our model is a field theory model that one can compute directly and reliably .",
    "our final result shows that @xmath0 does not have to develop a local minimum at @xmath14 .",
    "we will study real scalar theories in cases i - iii:@xmath18where@xmath19the @xmath0 of cases i and ii are well studied in @xcite and we follow the treatment there . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are renormalized quantities and the counterterm lagrangian is not shown .",
    "the renormalization condition is that the counterterms do not change the particle mass and the four - point coupling at threshold .",
    "we will set @xmath22 such that the systems are bounded from below and we can compute to leading order , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , in the  @xmath23 expansions . in case i , @xmath24 and @xmath25 stays in the symmetric phase .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 is monotonically decreasing in temperature ( @xmath26 ) @xcite . in case ii , @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 symmetry is spontaneously broken below the phase transition temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 is monotonically decreasing when @xmath29 and becomes  monotonically increasing when @xmath30 . also , @xmath0 forms a cusp at @xmath14 under the mean field approximation @xcite .     because there is no interaction between @xmath25 and @xmath31 in case iii",
    ", the entropy density is just the sum of the @xmath25 and @xmath31 entropy @xmath32analogously , in a linear response theory , the kubo formula relates @xmath3 to an ensemble average of a correlator @xmath33 \\rangle \\ ,   \\label{kubo}\\]]where @xmath34 is the spacial part of the off - diagonal energy momentum tensor . @xmath35 and @xmath36 \\rangle = \\left [ \\left\\langle t_{i}^{ij}(0)\\right\\rangle , \\left\\langle t_{ii}^{ij}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\right\\rangle \\right ] = 0 $ ] , such that @xmath37    the high @xmath26 behavior of @xmath0 can be analyzed using the @xmath38 expansion as in ref .",
    "@xcite . by neglect the slow running of the coupling constant , the dimensionful quantities @xmath21 and @xmath26",
    "can only contribute to the dimensionless ratio @xmath0 through the @xmath39 combination ( note that it is @xmath21 , not @xmath40 that appears in the lagrangian ) .",
    "as @xmath41 , @xmath0 has the following @xmath38 expansion @xmath42where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "there is no @xmath38 term because as mentioned above , the result does not depend on the sign of @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath38 expansion of @xmath0 in case iii has the similar structure @xmath45furthermore , in the limit of @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 by eqs.([s ] ) and ( [ eta_iii ] ) .",
    "this implies @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath52 , @xmath53 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath26 as @xmath54 .",
    "the question is , whether this behavior persists from large @xmath26 down to @xmath14 . before answering this question numerically",
    ", we will try to understand the behaviors of @xmath3 and @xmath4 separately .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show the typical @xmath55 , the effective quasiparticle mass of case @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath26 . when @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    ". then @xmath60 increases for increasing @xmath26 due to the positive thermal mass effect , while @xmath61 decreases to zero at @xmath14 , and then increases again at higher @xmath26 . as @xmath41 , @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "we have chosen the parameters such that @xmath64 @xmath61 at all @xmath26 , which gives @xmath65 in fig .",
    "the cusp in @xmath66 is barely visible .    in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath67 is also shown .",
    "its behavior is very similar to that of @xmath68 . to further explore this relation",
    ", we use the kinetic theory approximation @xmath69where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the quasiparticle density , velocity and mean free path , respectively . then using @xmath73 ,",
    "where @xmath74 is the number density and @xmath16 is the cross section between quasiparticles , we have @xmath75where @xmath76 is the averaged quasiparticle energy . in a weakly coupled system , @xmath76 can be approximated as a gas of free particles with mass @xmath68@xmath77 , \\]]where @xmath78 and the bose - einstein distribution @xmath79 . in two body collisions",
    ", @xmath16 can be approximated as @xmath80thus , @xmath81    the effective coupling @xmath82 is @xmath26 dependent .",
    "the explicit expression for the scattering amplitude is @xcite @xmath83 .\\]]when @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "however , @xmath87 causes no momentum redistribution and hence the @xmath88- and @xmath89-channels have no contribution to @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we can approximate @xmath90 as @xmath91under this approximation , @xmath82 decreases smoothly from @xmath92 at @xmath57 , to @xmath20 at @xmath14  and stays constant above @xmath14 . since @xmath82 only varies by a factor @xmath93",
    ", we can further approximate it by a constant @xmath20 such that @xmath94 . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath95 is indeed qualitatively similar to that of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "2 .    finally , we present the @xmath0 results in fig .",
    "they are qualitatively similar to @xmath67 . as speculated above",
    ", @xmath53 is indeed monotonically decreasing both below and above @xmath14 .",
    "this is a counterexample to the previous speculation that @xmath0 goes to a local minimum at @xmath14 of a second order phase transition .",
    "there are some approximations that we have made in this calculation but none of them should change our conclusion qualitatively .",
    "the first one is the hartree approximation  that is used to neglect all the sunset diagrams below @xmath14 .",
    "this approximation  is good when @xmath96 . at lower @xmath26 ,",
    "the hartree approximation is not reliable .",
    "however , as @xmath97 , @xmath4 approaches zero exponentially ( the excitations are massive ) while @xmath3 approaches zero via power laws . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 is decreasing in cases i - iii at low @xmath98 .",
    "this feature is not affected despite the hartree approximation used .",
    "the second approximation used is the mean field approximation .",
    "unaccounted quantum fluctuations can make the result reliable in the region @xmath99 .",
    "however , this region can be made arbitrarily small by reducing @xmath20 .",
    "finally , the end point of a first order phase transition ( called a critical point ( cp ) ) is also a second order phase transition .",
    "this is a special kind of second order phase transition which can be modeled by an effective field theory whose @xmath100 and @xmath101 couplings vanishes at @xmath102 , so that the leading coupling is @xmath103 .",
    "hence the cp case is different from the cases we consider here . in some systems @xmath3",
    "diverges weakly near a cp .",
    "the ratio @xmath0 , the shear viscosity ( @xmath1 to entropy density ( @xmath2 , reaches its local minimum at the ( second order ) phase transition temperature in a wide class of systems .",
    "it was suspected that this behavior might be universal .",
    "however , we have presented a counterexample made of a system of two weakly self - interacting real scalar fields with one of them condensing at low temperatures while the other remains in the symmetric phase .",
    "there is no interaction between the two fields .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 is monotonically decreasing in temperature despite the phase transition .",
