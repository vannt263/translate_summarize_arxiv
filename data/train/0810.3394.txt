    "the schrdinger equation describing electron in a two - dimensional quantum dot normal to the @xmath0 axis is of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the effective electron mass .",
    "the vector potential @xmath3 of a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the plane of the quantum dot leads to the generalized momentum @xmath4 we have the usual expression for the zeeman interaction @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the effective gyromagnetic factor , @xmath7 is the bohr s magneton the rashba spin - orbit interaction @xcite is represented as @xmath8 the pauli spin - matrices are defined as standard , @xmath9    a confining potential is usually assumed to be symmetric,@xmath10 .",
    "there are two model potentials which are widely employed in this area .",
    "the first is a harmonic oscillator potential @xcite .",
    "such a model admits the approximate ( not exact ) solutions of eq .",
    "the second model is a circular quantum dot with hard walls @xcite @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "this model is exactly solvable . in the framework of above models",
    "the number of allowed energy levels is infinite for the fixed total angular momentum in the absence of a magnetic field .    in this paper , we propose new model which corresponds to a circular quantum dot with a potential well of finite depth : @xmath15 for @xmath12 , @xmath16 for @xmath14 .",
    "our model is exactly solvable and the number of admissible energy levels is finite for the fixed total angular momentum in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the present solutions contain , as limiting cases , our previous results @xcite ( no external magnetic field ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( 1 ) is considered in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath17 further it is convenient to employ dimensionless quantities @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the electron mass . as it was shown in @xcite equation ( 1 )",
    "permits the separation of variables @xmath20 due to conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "we have the following radial equations @xmath22 in @xcite , the requirements @xmath23 were imposed . in our model , we look for the radial wave functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 regular at the origin @xmath26 and decreasing at infinity @xmath27 .",
    "following @xcite we use the substitutions @xmath28 which lead to the confluent hypergeometric equations in the case @xmath29 .",
    "therefore we attempt to express the desired solutions of eq .",

    "we consider two regions @xmath31 ( region 1 ) and @xmath32 ( region 2 ) separately .    in the region 1 ( @xmath33 ) , using the known properties @xmath34 of the confluent hypergeometric functions @xmath35 of the first kind @xcite it is easily to show that the suitable particular solutions of the radial equations are @xmath36 where @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are arbitrary coefficients .",

    "@xcite it is simply to get the suitable real solutions of the radial equations : @xmath49 where @xmath50 for @xmath38 , @xmath51 for @xmath40 and @xmath52 here @xmath53 and @xmath54 are arbitrary coefficients . the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 have the appropriate behavior at infinity .",
    "we assume the realization of condition @xmath57 which means that electron belongs to a quantum dot .",
    "we can also obtain the exact solutions when @xmath58 .",
    "however , in this case we can not consider electron as belonging to a quantum dot .",
    "the continuity conditions @xmath59 for the radial wave functions and their derivatives at the boundary point @xmath60 lead to the algebraic equations @xmath61 for coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath54 where @xmath63    hence , the exact equation for energy @xmath64 is @xmath65 this equation is solved numerically .",
    "the desired coefficients are @xmath66 where @xmath67 the value of @xmath42 is determined by the following normalization condition @xmath68 .",
    "now we present some numerical and graphic illustrations in addition to the analytical results for the ground and first excited states in the particular cases @xmath69 at fixed @xmath70    tables show the energies @xmath71 for different values of the rashba parameter @xmath72 , the well depth @xmath73 and the magnetic field @xmath74 .",
