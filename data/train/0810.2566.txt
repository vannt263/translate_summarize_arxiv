    "in this paper , we use the fact that the selection of @xmath0 galaxies through the _ i - dropout _ technique is largely free of contamination from objects at lower ( and higher ) redshift @xcite provided that the observations are deep enough . because the transverse size of the mr simulation box ( 500 @xmath27  mpc ) corresponds to a comoving volume between @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( the typical redshift range of @xmath5-dropouts  surveys ) we can use the three simulation snapshots centered at @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 to create a mock survey spanning this volume , while safely neglecting objects at other redshifts .",
    "we extracted galaxies from the mr database by selecting the @xmath53axis of the simulation box to lie along the line - of - sight of our mock field . in order to compare with the deepest current surveys , we calculated the apparent magnitudes in the hst / acs @xmath54 , @xmath2  and @xmath37  filters and the 2mass @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 filters .",

    "however , when considering the sample as a whole the surface densities of @xmath5-dropouts near @xmath0 qsos are fairly average , given that four of the qso fields have lower or similar number counts compared to the field . with the exception perhaps of the field towards the highest redshift qso j1148 + 5251 , which lies at a redshift where the @xmath5-dropout selection is particularly inefficient ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nz2 ] ) , the lack of evidence for substantial ( surface ) overdensities in the qso fields is puzzling .",
    "panels show the number of neighbours ( @xmath2-dropouts ) in cubic regions of @xmath206 mpc@xmath61 versus the mass of the most massive halo found in each of those regions .",
    "top and bottom panels are for snapshots at @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively",
    ". left and right panels are for neighbour counts down to limiting magnitudes of @xmath37=27.5 ( left ) and @xmath37@xmath207 mag , respectively .",
    "there is a wide dispersion in the number of neighbours , even for the most massive halos at @xmath0 .",
    "the highest numbers of neighbours are exclusively associated with the massive end of the halo mass function , allowing one to derive a lower limit for the mass of the most massive halo for a given number of neighbour counts .",
    "the scatter in the number of neighbours versus the mass of the most massive halo reduces signficantly when going to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the small squares in the panels on the right correspond to the three richest regions ( in terms of @xmath37@xmath11826.5 mag dropouts ) that are shown in close - up in fig . [",
    "fig : z6panels ] . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : boxtest ] we have plotted the number of @xmath2-dropouts encountered in cubic regions of @xmath208 @xmath27 mpc against the mass of the most massive dark matter halo found in each region .",
    "panels on the left and on the right are for limiting magnitudes of @xmath37=27.5 and 26.5 mag , respectively . because the most massive halos are so rare , here we have used the full mr snapshots at @xmath50 ( top panels ) and @xmath51 ( bottom panels ) rather than the lightcone in order to improve the statistics . there is a systematic increase in the number of neighbours with increasing maximum halo mass .",
    "however , the scatter is very large : for example , focusing on the neighbour count prediction for @xmath50 and @xmath37@xmath11826.5 ( top right panel ) we see that the number of neighbours of a halo of @xmath209 @xmath27 @xmath12 can be anywhere between 0 and 20 , and some of the most massive halos of @xmath111 @xmath27 @xmath12 have a relatively low number of counts compared to some of the halos of significant lower mass that are far more numerous .",
    "however , for a given @xmath37@xmath11826.5 neighbour count ( in a @xmath208 @xmath27 mpc region ) of @xmath210 , the halo mass is _ always _ above @xmath211 @xmath27 @xmath12 , and",
    "if one would observe @xmath212 @xmath2-dropout counts one could conclude that that field must contain a supermassive halo of @xmath213 @xmath27 @xmath12 .",
    "thus , in principle , one can only estimate a lower limit on the maximum halo mass as a function of the neighbour counts .",
    "the left panel shows that the scatter is much reduced if we are able to count galaxies to a limiting @xmath37-band magnitude of 27.5 instead of 26.5 , simply because the poisson noise is greatly reduced .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the relatively average number of counts observed in the qso fields is not inconsistent with the qsos being hosted by very massive halos .",
    "however , one could make an equally strong case that they are , in fact , not . if we translate our results of fig .",
    "[ fig : boxtest ] to the qso fields that cover a smaller projected area of @xmath214 mpc@xmath82 , and we add back in the average counts from the fore- and background provided by our lightcone data , we estimate that for qsos at @xmath215 we require an overdensity of @xmath216 in order to be able to put a lower limit on the qso host mass of @xmath217 @xmath12 , while a @xmath218 is consistent with @xmath108 @xmath12 . at @xmath51",
    ", we would require @xmath219 for @xmath220 @xmath12 and @xmath221 for @xmath222 @xmath12 .",
    "comparison with the relatively low surface overdensities observed thus suggests that the halo mass is uncontrained by the current data .",
    "nonetheless , we can at least conclude quite firmly that the qsos are in far less rich environments ( in terms of galaxy neigbours ) compared to many rich regions found both in the simulations and in some of the deep field surveys described in the previous section . in order to get a feel for what the qso fields might have looked like if they were in highly overdense regions , we present some close - up views in fig .",
    "[ fig : z6panels ] of the three richest regions of @xmath37@xmath11826.5 mag @xmath2-dropouts as marked by the small squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : boxtest ] .",
    "the central position corresponding to that of the most massive halo in each region is indicated by the green square .",
    "large and small dots correspond to dropout galaxies having @xmath37@xmath11826.5 and @xmath11827.5 mag , respectively .",
    "for reference , we use blue circles to indicate galaxies that have been identified as part of a protocluster structure .",
    "the scale bar at the top left in each panel corresponds to the size of an acs / wfc pointing used to observe @xmath0 qso fields .",
    "we make a number of interesting observations .",
    "first , using the current observational limits on depth ( @xmath37=26.5 mag ) and field size ( 3.4 , see scale bar ) imposed by the acs observations of qsos , it would actually be quite easy to miss some of these structures as they typically span a larger region of 23 acs fields in diameter .",
    "going too much fainter magnitudes would help considerably , but this is at present unfeasible .",
    "note , also , that in three of the panels presented here , the galaxy associated with the massive central halo does not pass our magnitude limits .",
    "it is missed due to dust obscuration associated with very high star formation rates inside these halos , implying that they will be missed by large - area uv searches as well ( unless , of course , they also host a luminous , unobscured qso ) .        finally , we investigate the level of mutual correspondence between the most massive halos selected at @xmath9 and @xmath8 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : z6panels ] we already saw that the richest regions are associated with a very large number of galaxies that will become part of a cluster when evolved to @xmath8 . in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : hh ] we show the mass of the most massive progenitors at @xmath50 ( left ) , @xmath51 ( middle ) ad @xmath52 ( right ) of halos selected at @xmath8 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the dotted line indicates the threshold corresponding to massive galaxy clusters at @xmath8 .",
    "although the progenitor mass increases systematically with increasing local mass , the dispersion in the mass of the most massive @xmath0 progenitors is about or over one order of magnitude , and this is true even for the most massive clusters . as explained in detail by @xcite this observation leads to an interesting complication when using the refinement technique often used to simulate the most massive regions in the early universe by resimulating at high redshift the most massive region identified at @xmath8 in a coarse grid simulation . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : hh ] we show the inverse relation between the most massive halos selected at @xmath0 and their most massive descendant at @xmath8 . from this",
    "it becomes clear that eventhough the most massive @xmath0 halos ( e.g. those associated with qsos ) are most likely to end up in present - day clusters , some evolve into only modest local structures more compatible with , e.g. , galaxy groups .",
    "this implies that the present - day descendants of some of the first , massive galaxies and supermassive black holes must be sought in sub - cluster environments .",
    "although our findings of the previous section show that the apparent lack of excess neighbour counts near @xmath0 qsos is not inconsistent with them being hosted by supermassive dark matter halos as suggested by their low co - moving abundance and large inferred black hole mass , it is interesting to note that none of the qso fields have densities that would place them amongst the richest structures in the @xmath0 universe .",
    "this leads to an intriguing question : where is the large - scale structure associated with qsos ?",
    "one possibility that has been discussed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that while the dark matter density near the qsos is significantly higher compared to other fields , the strong ionizing radiation from the qso may prohibit the condensation of gas thereby suppressing galaxy formation .",
    "although it is not clear how important such feedback processes are exactly , we have found that proto - clusters in the mr form inside density enhancements that can extend up to many tens of mpc in size .",
    "although we do not currently know whether the @xmath0 qsos might be associated with overdensities on scales larger than a few arcminutes as probed by the acs , it is unlikely that the qso ionization field will suppress the formation of galaxies on such large scales @xcite .",
    "an alternative , perhaps more likely , explanation for the deficit of @xmath2-dropouts near qsos , is that the dark matter halo mass of the qsos is being greatly overestimated .",
    "@xcite suggest that the combination of the steepness of the halo mass function for rare high redshift halos on one hand , combined with the sizeable intrinsic scatter in the correlation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion or halo mass at low redshift on the other hand , makes it much more probable that a @xmath223 @xmath12 black hole is found in relatively low mass halos than in a very rare halo of extremely high mass .",
    "depending on the exact value of the scatter , the typical mass of a halo hosting a @xmath0 qso may be reduced by @xmath224 in log @xmath15@xmath225 without breaking the low redshift @xmath15@xmath226 relation .",
    "the net result is that qsos occur in some subset of halos found in substantially less dense environments , which may explain the observations .",
    "this notion seems to be confirmed by the low dynamical mass of @xmath227 @xmath12 estimated for the inner few kpc region of sdss j1148 + 5251 at @xmath199 based on the co line emission @xcite .",
    "this is in complete contradiction to the @xmath217 @xmath12 stellar mass bulges and @xmath228 @xmath12 mass halos derived based on other arguments .",
    "if true , models should then explain why the number density of such qsos is as observed .",
    "on the other hand , recent theoretical work by @xcite suggests that in order to facilitate the formation of a supermassive ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) by @xmath0 in the first place , it may be required to have a rare pair of dark matter halos ( @xmath228 @xmath12 ) in which the intense uv radiation from one halo prevents fragmentation of the other so that the gas collapses directly into a supermassive blackhole .",
    "this would constrain the qsos to lie in even richer environments .",
    "the predicted large - scale distributions of @xmath2-dropouts and ly@xmath3  emitters as shown in , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig : field ] , [ fig : ota ] and [ fig : ouchi ] show evidence for variations in the large - scale structure on scales of up to @xmath131 - 2 , far larger than currently probed by deep hst or large - area ground - based surveys",
    ". a full appreciation of such structures could be important for a range of topics , including studies of the luminosity function at @xmath0 and studies of the comparison between @xmath19cdm predictions and gravitational clustering on very large scales .",
    "the total area probed by our simulation is a good match to a survey of @xmath229 degree@xmath82 targeting @xmath2-dropouts and ly@xmath3  emitters at @xmath0 planned with the forthcoming subaru / hypersurpimecam ( first light expected 2013 ; m. ouchi , private communications , 2008 ) .",
    "we found that the @xmath2-dropouts associated with proto - clusters are almost exclusively found in regions with positive density enhancements .",
    "a proper understanding of such dense regions may also be very important for studies of the epoch of reionization .",
    "simulations suggest that even though the total number of ionizing photons is much larger in very large proto - cluster regions covering several tens of comoving mpc as compared to the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite ) , they may still be the last to fully re - inionize , because the recombination rates are also much higher .",
    "if regions associated with qsos or other structures were to contain significant patches of neutral hydrogen , this may affect both the observed number densities and clustering of lbgs or ly@xmath3  emitters relative to our assumed mean attenuation @xcite .",
    "since our work mostly focuses on @xmath59 when reionization is believed to be largely completed , this may not be such an issue compared to surveys that probe earlier times at @xmath230 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our evaluation of the possible structures associated with qsos leads to several suggestions for future observations .",
    "while it is unlikely that the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) to be installed onboard hst in early 2009 will provide better contraints than hst / acs due to its relatively small field - of - view , we have shown that either by surveying a larger area of @xmath1310@xmath8410  or by going deeper by @xmath131 mag in @xmath37 , one significantly reduces the shot noise in the neighbour counts allowing more reliable overdensities and ( lower ) limits on the halo masses to be estimated .",
    "a single pointing with acs would require @xmath231 orbits in @xmath37  to reach a point source sensitivity of 5@xmath88 for a @xmath37=27.5 mag object at @xmath0 .",
    "given the typical structure sizes of the overdense regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z6panels ] , a better approach would perhaps be to expand the area of the current qso fields by several more acs pointings at their present depth of @xmath37=26.5 mag for about an equal amount of time .",
    "however , this may be achieved from the ground as well using the much more efficient wide - field detector systems .",
    "although this has been attempted by @xcite targeting three of the qso fields , we note that their achieved depth of @xmath37=25.5 was probably much too shallow to find any overdensities even if they are there .",
    "we would like to stress that it is extremely important that foreground contamination is reduced as much as possible , for example by combining the observations with a deep exposure in the @xmath54  band .",
    "this is currently not available for the qso fields , making it very hard to calculate the exact magnitude of any excess counts present .",
    "while a depth of @xmath37=27.5 mag seems out of reach for a statistical sample with hst , narrow - band ly@xmath3  surveys targeting the typically uv - faint ly@xmath3emitters from the ground would be a very efficient alternative .",
    "although a significant fraction of sources lacking ly@xmath3may be lost compared to dropout surveys , they have the clear additional advantage of redshift information .",
    "most ly@xmath3  surveys are carried out in the atmospheric transmission windows that correspond to redshifted ly@xmath3  either at @xmath215 or @xmath232 for which efficient narrow - band filters exist .",
    "we therefore suggest that the experiment is most likely to succeed around qsos at @xmath215 rather than the qsos at @xmath233 looked at so far .",
    "it is , however , possible to use combinations of , e.g. , the @xmath215 narrow - band filter with medium or broad band filters at @xmath139000to place stronger constaints on the photometric redshifts of @xmath2-dropouts in qso fields ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath234 we give detailed examples of the structure of proto - cluster regions .",
    "although the typical separation between protocluster galaxies does not reach beyond @xmath1310  ( 25 mpc comoving ) , they sit in overdensities that extend up to 30  radius , indicating that the proto - clusters predominantly form deep inside the largest filamentary structures .",

    "<S> motivated by recent observational studies of the environment of @xmath0 qsos , we have used the millennium run ( mr ) simulations to construct a very large ( @xmath1 ) mock redshift survey of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we use this simulated survey to study the relation between density enhancements in the distribution of @xmath2-dropouts and ly@xmath3  emitters , and their relation to the most massive halos and protocluster regions at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation predicts significant variations in surface density across the sky with some voids and filaments extending over scales of 1@xmath4 , much larger than probed by current surveys . </S>",
    "<S> approximately one third of all @xmath0 halos hosting @xmath5-dropouts brighter than @xmath6=26.5 mag ( @xmath7 ) become part of @xmath8 galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5-dropouts associated with protocluster regions are found in regions where the surface density is enhanced on scales ranging from a few to several tens of arcminutes on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze two structures of @xmath5-dropouts and ly@xmath3  emitters observed with the subaru telescope and show that these structures must be the seeds of massive clusters - in - formation . in striking contrast </S>",
    "<S> , six @xmath0 qso fields observed with hst show no significant enhancements in their @xmath2-dropout number counts . with the present data </S>",
    "<S> , we can not rule out the qsos being hosted by the most massive halos . however </S>",
    "<S> , neither can we confirm this widely used assumption . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by giving detailed recommendations for the interpretation and planning of observations by current and future ground- and space based instruments that will shed new light on questions related to the large - scale structure at @xmath0 .    </S>",
