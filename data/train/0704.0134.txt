    "one of the most important discoveries in relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brokhaven national laboratory is the large elliptic flow in non - central au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow measures the momentum anisotropy of produced particles and is quantified by the 2nd harmonic of the azimuthal distribution ,    @xmath0    elliptic flow is naturally explained in hydrodynamics .",
    "hydrodynamic pressure is built up from rescattering of secondaries , and pressure gradients drive the subsequent collective motion . in non - central au+au collisions , initially , the reaction zone is asymmetric ( almond shaped ) .",
    "the pressure gradient is large in one direction and small in the other .",
    "the asymmetric pressure gradients generates the elliptic flow .",
    "naturally , in a central collision , reaction zone is symmetric and elliptic flow vanishes .",
    "observed elliptic flow then give the strongest indication that in non - central au+au collisions , a collective qcd matter is produced . whether the formed matter can be identified as the much sought after quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) as predicted in lattice qcd simulations @xcite is presently debatable .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics has been partly successful in explaining the observed elliptic flow , quantitatively @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow of identified particles , up to @xmath11.5 gev are well reproduced in ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics also explains the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles ( up to @xmath1 1.5 gev ) .",
    "success of _ ideal _ hydrodynamics in explaining bulk of the data @xcite , together with the string theory motivated lower limit of shear viscosity @xmath2 @xcite has led to a paradigm that in au+au collisions , a nearly perfect fluid is created .    however , the paradigm of `` perfect fluid '' produced in au+au collisions at rhic need to be clarified .",
    "as indicated above , the ideal hydrodynamics is only partially successful and in a limited @xmath3 range ( @xmath41.5 gev ) @xcite .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles also starts to deviate form ideal fluid dynamics prediction beyond @xmath5 1.5 gev .",
    "experimentally determined hbt radii are not reproduced in the ideal fluid dynamic models , the famous `` hbt puzzle '' @xcite .",
    "it also do not reproduce the experimental trend that elliptic flow saturates at large transverse momentum .",
    "these shortcomings of ideal fluid dynamics indicate greater importance of dissipative effects in the @xmath3 ranges greater than 1.5 gev or in more peripheral collisions .",
    "indeed , ideal fluid is a concept , never realized in nature .",
    "as suggested in string theory motivated models @xcite , qgp viscosity could be small , @xmath2 , nevertheless it is non - zero .",
    "it is important to study the effect of viscosity , even if small , on space - time evolution of qgp fluid and quantify its effect .",
    "this requires a numerical implementation of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "furthermore , if qgp fluid is formed in heavy ion collisions , it has to be characterized by measuring its transport coefficients , e.g. heat conductivity , bulk and shear viscosity .",
    "theoretically , it is possible to obtain those transport coefficients in a kinetic theory model .",
    "however , in the present status of theory , the goal can not be achieved immediately , even more so for a strongly interacting qgp ( sqgp ) .",
    "alternatively , one can use the experimental data to obtain a `` phenomenological '' limit of transport coefficients of sqgp .",
    "it will also require a numerical implementation of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics .",
    "there is another incentive to study dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics depends on the assumption of local equilibrium . before local equilibrium is attained , the system has to pass through a non - equilibrium stage , where ( if non - equilibrium effects are small ) dissipative hydrodynamics may be applicable .",
    "indeed , we can explore early times of fluid evolution better in a dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "theory of dissipative relativistic fluid has been formulated quite early .",
    "the original dissipative relativistic fluid equations were given by eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "they are called 1st order theories .",
    "formally , relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics are obtained from an expansion of entropy 4-current , in terms of dissipative fluxes . in 1st order theories ,",
    "entropy 4-current contains terms linear in dissipative quantities .",
    "1st order theory of dissipative hydrodynamics suffer from the problem of causality violation .",
    "signal can travel faster than light .",
    "causality violation is unwarranted in any theory , even more in a relativistic theory .",
    "the problem of causality violation is removed in the israel - stewart s 2nd order theory of dissipative fluid @xcite . in 2nd order theory ,",
    "expansion of entropy 4-current contains terms 2nd order in dissipative fluxes .",
    "however , these leads to complications that dissipative fluxes are no longer function of the state variables only .",
    "they become dynamic .",
    "the space of thermodynamic variables has to be extended to include the dissipative fluxes ( e.g. heat conductivity , bulk and shear viscosity ) .",
    "even though 2nd order theory was formulated some 30 years back , significant progress towards its numerical implementation has only been made very recently @xcite . at the cyclotron centre , kolkata ,",
    "we have developed a code `` azhydro - kolkata '' to simulate the hydrodynamic evolution of dissipative qgp fluid .",
    "presently only dissipative effect included is the shear viscosity .",
    "some results of azhydro - kolkata , for first order dissipative hydrodynamics have been published earlier @xcite . in the present paper , for the first time",
    ", we will present some results for 2nd order dissipative hydrodynamics in 2 + 1 dimensions . in the present paper , we will consider effect of dissipation in the qgp phase only .",
    "effect of phase transition will be studied in a later publication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we briefly review relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we derive the relevant equations in 2 + 1 dimension ( assuming boost - invariance ) . required inputs e.g. the equation of state , viscosity coefficient and initial conditions are discussed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "simulation results from azhydro - kolkata are shown in section  [ sec5 ] . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we compare the transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow of quarks in ideal and viscous dynamics .",
    "the concluding section  [ sec7 ] summarizes our results .",
    "in this section , i briefly discuss the phenomenological theory of dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "more detailed exposition can be found in @xcite .    a simple fluid , in an arbitrary state , is fully specified by primary variables : particle current ( @xmath6 ) , energy - momentum tensor ( @xmath7 ) and entropy current ( @xmath8 ) and a number of additional ( unknown ) variables .",

    "central rapidity region is nearly baryon free and landau s frame is more appropriate than the eckart s frame .",
    "dissipative flows are transverse to @xmath11 and additionally , shear stress tensor is traceless .",

    "<S> in 2nd order causal dissipative theory , space - time evolution of qgp fluid is studied in 2 + 1 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are solved simultaneously with the energy - momentum conservation equations . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous qgp fluid , initialized under the same conditions , e.g. same equilibration time , energy density and velocity profile , indicate that in a viscous dynamics , energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly , than in an ideal fluid . </S>",
    "<S> cooling gets slower as viscosity increases . </S>",
    "<S> transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics . for the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of quarks in causal viscous dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to non - equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function , and can not be mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics . </S>"
