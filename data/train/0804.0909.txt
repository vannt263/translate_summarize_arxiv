    "it is widely believed that type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems , triggered when a white dwarf grows up to the chandrasekhar mass by accretion from its companion ( see nomoto et al .",
    "1997 ; hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ; livio 2001 for reviews ) . however , the progenitor binary system leading to sne ia is still unknown , and there are two competing scenarios for the accretion process triggering sne ia . in the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario ,",
    "the accretion is from a non - degenerate companion star ( whelan & iben 1973 ; nomoto 1982 ) , while in the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario , a merger of two white dwarfs results in a sn ia ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) . to reveal",
    "the progenitor is important not only for better understanding of this one of the brightest explosions in the universe , but also for controlling systematic uncertainties when sne ia are used as a standard candle to measure the expansion rate of the universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "sne ia are expected to have a wide range of delay time from star formation to supernova explosions , and the delay time distribution ( dtd ) can be used to discriminate the proposed progenitor models , since different progenitor scenarios predict different dtds .",
    "the dtd @xmath7 is equivalent to the sn ia occurrence rate as a function of the ia delay time @xmath8 , for a single - burst stellar population of a unit stellar mass .",
    "hence , observational studies on sn ia rates should be able to constrain dtd ( mannucci et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "one such approach is to examine the evolution of the cosmic sn ia rate density ( pain et al .",

    "however , there is a degeneracy between sn ia dtd and the cosmic star formation history , and it is difficult to derive a strong constraint on dtd from the currently available data ( frster et al .",
    "2006 ; botticella et al .",
    "2008 ; oda et al . 2008 ; blanc & greggio 2008 ) .",
    "another approach is to study the dependence of sn rate on the host galaxy properties , such as colors or spectral energy distribution ( sed ) ( mannucci et al .",
    "2005 ; scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2006 ; aubourg et al .",
    "this approach has already given some useful constraints on dtd , indicating the existence of sn ia populations having both short ( @xmath9 0.1 gyr ) and long ( @xmath10 10 gyr ) delay times .",
    "however , the functional shape of @xmath11 has not yet quantitatively been constrained well . what has been done in previous studies",
    "is to assume simple mathematical functions for dtd or adopt theoretical dtd models to predict the distributions of some observational quantities such as host galaxy colors , and then compare them to the observed data .",
    "a clear next step is a measurement of dtd , i.e. , to constrain the functional form of dtd directly from the observed data , rather than testing particular dtd functions or models .    for a dtd measurement",
    ", one needs to reliably estimate the delay time of an observed sn ia and the stellar mass of its host galaxy .",
    "the mean stellar age of the host galaxy is an indicator of the delay time , but it is unreliable when the stellar age distribution has a large dispersion , as in galaxies having extended star formation history . the ideal population for this purpose is old galaxies with an approximately uniform stellar age , which experienced major star formation episode in the past and have little or no star formation activity at the time of a sn explosion .",
    "present - day elliptical galaxies are good examples , but they have a typical age of @xmath10 10 gyr ( barber et al . 2007 ; jimenez et al . 2007 ) , and hence we need to observe sne at higher redshifts to get a sample of sne having shorter delay times .",
    "however , both detection of sne and stellar age estimate of host galaxies become difficult at high redshifts .",
    "the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds , furusawa et al . 2008 ) , which is the deepest survey among those wider than @xmath31 deg@xmath12 with a broad coverage of various wavelengths , provides a unique data set for this purpose . in optical bands , this field has been observed repeatedly with some time intervals , and a systematic variable object search has been performed ( morokuma et al .",
    "2008a , b ) , leading to detection of more than 1,000 variable objects down to a limiting variability magnitude of @xmath13 ( ab ) .",
    "the majority of them are high - redshift supernovae and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "this data set includes many passively evolving old galaxies at redshift @xmath14 , which are believed to be the direct ancestors of the present - day elliptical galaxies ( yamada et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we can estimate the stellar age and stellar mass of host galaxies by photometric redshift calculations using the rich photometric data in the 9 band filters ( @xmath15 , 3.6 , and @xmath16 m ) .",
    "the required accuracy for the age estimate in this work is about a factor of two , and we will show that such an accuracy can be achieved for the galaxies used in this work , by a variety of tests for the age estimates .    in this paper",
    "we measure the sn ia dtd by selecting the sxds variable objects found in old or passively evolving galaxies at @xmath17 0.41.2 .",
    "spectroscopic sn type confirmation is not available for the faint sxds sn candidates .",
    "it is difficult to construct a complete high - redshift sn sample with spectroscopic type classification under homogeneous conditions of spectroscopic observation , and contamination of sne with no or poor spectroscopic data is one of the most challenging sources of uncertainty in sn rate studies ( strolger et al .",

    "2007 ) . here , instead of using spectroscopic information",
    ", we select variable objects in old galaxies with spatial offset from the galactic centers , and hence the majority of them are expected to be sne ia .",
    "in fact , we will quantitatively demonstrate that more than 80 % of them should be sne ia , based on the properties of the sn candidates and their host galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that selecting sne only in a particular type of galaxies does not induce bias in the dtd estimates , since we measure sn ia rate normalized by stellar mass of host galaxies having the same type .",
    "this is in contrast to measurements of total cosmic sn rate density , in which selection of any particular galaxy type obviously leads to an underestimate of the total rate .",
    "on the other hand , we can not measure dtd at short delay times obviously because of selecting old galaxies .",
    "we will present a measurement of dtd in a range of @xmath18 = 0.18.0 gyr , corresponding to the distribution of mean stellar ages of the old galaxies used in this work .",
    "our dtd measurement will be supplemented by the sn ia rate measured for elliptical galaxies in the local universe , to obtain dtd in @xmath19 0.110 gyr .",
    "the derived dtd will then be compared with a wide range of the existing theoretical dtd predictions , to get implications for the sn ia progenitor .    in section [ section : methods ] , we describe the sxds data set and selection procedures of old galaxies and sn candidates . in section [ section :",

    "it is impressive that the predictions by different authors are very close , and in excellent agreement with the observed dtd at @xmath80 0.2 gyr .",
    "it is not surprising that different authors made similar predictions , because it is a robust and generic prediction of the dd scenario as argued below .",

    "this is a general result applicable to any merging phenomena triggered by gravitational wave radiation , such as binary neutron star mergers ( totani 1997 ) , and this is why the dtd models by different authors are quite similar to each other , especially at large delay times .",

    "[ fig : dtd_dd ] , we selected the standard dtd model when a few models based on the dd scenario are presented by a single author group [ the standard dds model of belczynski et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and the close - dd model of greggio ( 2005 ) ] .",
    "the variation models predict slightly different value of @xmath94 , but smooth power - law like dtds are always common predictions , as expected from the above consideration .    on the other hand , the difference between the dtd predictions by different authors becomes bigger at short delay time ( @xmath95 gyr ) , where the delay time is dominated by stellar evolution time scale rather than @xmath81 .",
    "there are large uncertainties in the treatments of stellar evolution in binary population synthesis , and the discrepancy between some of the dtd models and the observed data at this short @xmath8 range is not serious for the dd scenario .",
    "it is generally assumed that dd binaries are formed through the common envelope evolution phase .",
    "if , in addition , dd binaries are formed also from intermediate mass binaries through the classical roche lobe outflow phase , dd binaries of this channel with large separations may affect the late time behavior of the dtd in the dd scenario ( de donder & vanbeveren 2003 ) .",
    "in other words , the observed dtd gives some constraints on the efficiency of dd binary formation via the roche lobe outflow phase .",
    "the measured dtd is compared with the theoretical models based on the sd scenario in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtd_sd ] .",
    "again , the normalization of the models is arbitrary , and we should compare only the shape of the dtd function . here , the theoretical curves are normalized by @xmath96 minimization to the data ( our own measurements at 0.18 gyr plus the 11 gyr data point ) .",
    "in contrast to the dd scenario , the predictions by this scenario are quite different depending on different authors .",
    "it is common to this scenario that the delay time is essentially determined by the main - sequence life time of the secondary star in a binary , because other time scales ( e.g. , accretion phase onto the white dwarf ) are much shorter .",
    "however , the dtd models shown in this figure are calculated by considerably different methods with a wide range of complexity .    the predictions by matteucci et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the @xmath97 model of kobayashi & nomoto ( 2008 , hereafter kn08 ) are close to a simple power - law , and they are relatively in good agreement with the observed dtd , compared with other models .",
    "however , it should be noted that the two models are based on the simplest calculations among the models shown here , though such a simple analytical approach is useful to see the general behaviors and in applications for e.g. , studies of chemical evolution in galaxies ( kobayashi et al . 1998 ; matteucci & recchi 2001 ; matteucci et al . 2006 ; kn08 ) . in these calculations ,",
    "the condition for a binary system to evolve to a sn ia event ( i.e. , stable accretion up to the chandrasekhar mass ) is determined by the initial masses of the primary and secondary stars , regardless of the binary separation .",
    "if the masses are in acceptable ranges , a binary evolves into a sn ia with a constant efficiency , and no sn ia is produced in other mass ranges . in such a calculation ,",
    "the dtd shape is determined by imf and the distribution of the primary / secondary mass ratio . if smooth functions are assumed for these , a smooth dtd without a characteristic scale of @xmath8 is obtained .",
    "however , a constant sn ia efficiency within an extended mass range is likely to be an oversimplification .",
    "the sn ia condition should be determined by the combination of the stellar masses and binary separation , and it is natural to expect that there are some characteristic secondary mass scales preferred for successful sn ia events , which should appear as particular time scales in dtd , rather than a power - law like dtd .    in the kn08 model based on the progenitor model of hachisu et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2008a ) , there are two distinct populations of the main - sequence donor channel ( wd+ms ) and the red - giant donor channel ( wd+rg ) for short and long delay times , respectively .",
    "the relative abundances of the two are determined empirically by fitting to the chemical evolution data , rather than by theoretical modeling .",
    "therefore , the good agreement of the kn08 model with our dtd estimate may partially be a result of this feedback from other observations , indicating that our dtd estimate is also consistent with the chemical evolution data . though the wd+ms channel is widely considered as the promising sd progenitor of sne ia ,",
    "some theoretical calculations indicate that the sn ia rate by the wd+rg channel is much lower than that of the wd+ms channel ( yungelson & livio 1998 ; han & podsiadlowski 2004 ; meng et al .",
    "2008 , but see also hachisu et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "the sn ia condition is determined only by stellar masses also in the standard sd - chandra model of greggio ( 2005 ) , but the mass budget of accretion up to the chandrasekhar mass is treated in more detail . an interesting feature is the sharp drop of dtd at a large delay time of @xmath98 gyr .",
    "sne ia with such a large delay time are produced from binary systems with a small secondary mass .",
    "such a low mass star has a small envelope mass that can be used for accretion onto its companion .",
    "therefore , the primary stellar mass must be large enough to ensure that the initial white dwarf mass is sufficiently massive and the white dwarf successfully grows to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "consequently , the number of binaries that can evolve to sne ia rapidly decreases with decreasing secondary mass .",
    "it seems difficult to reproduce a single power - law like dtd up to @xmath310 gyrs if this effect is incorporated",
    ".    finally , predictions of the sg - ch model of yungelson & livio ( 2000 ) , the standard sds model of belczynski et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the cls model of ruiz - lapuente & canal ( 1998 ) , and the model of meng et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) are shown , which are based on detailed calculations of the binary population synthesis , where the calculations start from the initial conditions including the primary and secondary stellar masses and the binary separation .",
    "there are a number of parameters and uncertain physical processes in such calculations , and different conditions for sne ia are assumed by different authors , leading to vastly different dtd predictions .",
    "however , a clear trend is that some characteristic scales of the delay time appear in the dtd , making the dtd shape more complex than the simple analytic models .",
    "this is reasonable in realistic conditions , as argued above , and it is theoretically unlikely that a simple power - law like dtd is obtained in the framework of the sd scenario .",
    "we measured the delay time distribution ( dtd ) of type ia supernovae by using the statistics of the faint variable objects detected in the systematic variable object survey performed as a part of the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey project .",
    "based on photometric redshift calculations using 9 band ( @xmath101 , 3.6 @xmath25 m , and 4.5 @xmath25 m ) photometries , we selected 16,492 old galaxies from the sxds data in the redshift range of @xmath102 , by requiring that their sed can be fit by a single starburst and their ages are significantly greater than the star formation time scales of the bursts .",
    "this selection is essential to our work , because stellar age is expected to be a good estimator of ia delay time in such galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we have two more merits of this selection : ( 1 ) delayed sne ia are dominant compared with cc sne and prompt sne ia , and ( 2 ) extinction effect should be small .",
    "we then selected variable objects associated with these galaxies but having significant offsets from the nuclei of galaxies , to remove the contamination of agns .",
    "we found 65 variable objects , whose locations with respect to their host galaxies closely trace the profiles of galactic light , and hence the majority of them must be supernovae .",
    "though we do not have spectroscopic confirmation of the sn types , we quantitatively demonstrated that the majority ( @xmath1080 % ) of the sn candidates should be sne ia , based on the variability luminosity , redshift distribution , and properties of the host galaxies .",
    "then the dtd in the delay time range of @xmath8 = 0.18 gyr is derived by calculating the delay time for each sn ia candidate from age and star formation history of host galaxies .",
    "combined with the observed sn ia rate in elliptical galaxies in the local universe , we derive the sn ia dtd in a range of @xmath0 0.111 gyr , and found that it can well be described by a simple power - law , @xmath103 with @xmath104 . here , the dtd function @xmath7 is per unit delay time and per unit mass of a single - burst stellar population , and @xmath45 ( @xmath46-band luminosity at an age of 11 gyr ) is used as an observational estimator of the stellar mass .",
    "we performed various tests about the systematic uncertainties in this dtd measurement , but the changes of dtd estimates are not large enough to change our main conclusions significantly .",
    "we tried a variety of dtd calculations with different prescriptions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtd_syst ] , but the decreasing trend of @xmath7 consistent with @xmath105 at @xmath106 0.33 gyr is found in all cases , and the data points at 0.52 gyr are especially robust against examined systematic uncertainties .",
    "the derived dtd at @xmath80 0.2 gyr is in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the dd scenario .",
    "the theoretical predictions by different authors are very similar to each other , and a featureless power - law shape is inevitable consequence of the general relativity in this scenario . therefore we consider that the agreement between the observed and predicted dtds gives a strong support to this scenario .",
    "it indicates that the major contributor to sne ia is the dd channel for delay times larger than @xmath107 gyr , although some contribution from other channels can not be excluded .",
    "on the other hand , the predictions by the competing sd scenario are vastly different for different authors .",
    "although the predicted dtds based on simple analytical approaches have smooth shapes which are broadly consistent with our measurement , predictions based on more detailed binary population synthesis calculations show strong peaks in the dtd shape , which do not fit the observed dtd .",
    "this trend can naturally be understood ; if there is any preferred scale of the secondary stellar mass for a binary to successfully evolve into a sn ia , it should be reflected as a characteristic delay time scale in this scenario",
    ". therefore we consider that our result does not favor the sd scenario in general as the major channel to the delayed sn ia population ( @xmath80 0.1 gyr ) .",
    "however , there are many degrees of freedom and uncertainties in the theoretical modeling based on the sd scenario , and it would be premature to reject the sd scenario simply from our result .",
    "our result should set strong constraints on the model parameter space if the sd channel is responsible for the majority of the delayed sne ia , and it would be useful for the future theoretical studies of the sd progenitor models .",
    "it is highly desirable to examine physical effects and evolutionary paths that are not taken into account in existing models of binary population synthesis .      in the literature",
    ", it has occasionally been argued that the sd scenario is more favored than the dd scenario , but arguments against the dd scenario are not particularly strong .",
    "a merger of two white dwarfs may result in an accretion induced collapse rather than a sn ia ( saio & nomoto 1985 ) , but theoretical uncertainties are still quite large ( piersanti et al . 2003 ; yoon et al . 2007 ) .",
    "many binary systems are proposed as candidates of the sn ia progenitor in the sd framework , compared with the observed number of dd binaries having total masses larger than the chandrasekhar mass ( parthasarathy et al .",
    "however , dd binaries are difficult to detect and the statistics of dd binary searches is not sufficient yet to confirm or reject the dd scenario ( tovmassian et al .",
    "2004 ; geier et al . 2007 ;",
    "napiwotzki 2007 ) .",
    "there are some implications for the progenitor from studies of sn ia remnants ( ruiz - lapuente et al . 2004 ; badenes et al . 2007 ;",
    "ihara et al . 2007 ) , or from spectroscopic studies ( leonard 2007 ; patat et al . 2007a , b ; simon et al .",
    "2007 ) and archival progenitor searches ( voss & nelemans 2008 ; nelemans et al . 2008 ; roelofs et al .",
    "2008 ) for nearby sne ia .",
    "however , conclusive results from these methods have not yet been obtained , mainly because of the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "another possibility is the sd sub - chandra scenario ( also known as helium ignitors or edge - lit detonations ) , in which white dwarfs explode as sne ia before they reach the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "since the required amount of accreting mass is smaller than in the sd chandra scenario , binaries with lower secondary masses can more easily evolve to sne ia .",
    "this might be useful to overcome the difficulty of the sd scenario to explain sn ia rate at @xmath108 gyr ( greggio 2005 ) . however , this scenario is currently not popular because predicted spectra are in serious disagreement with observations ( hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ; livio 2001 ) .",
    "recent studies ( scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; sullivan et al .",
    "2006 ; aubourg et al .",
    "2007 ) have tried to model the dtd by two components : the prompt component proportional to sfr and the delayed component proportional to stellar mass ( i.e. , constant @xmath109 ) .",
    "although our result does not put a strong constraint on the amount of the prompt component , a constant @xmath109 seems to be an oversimplification for the delayed component , since @xmath7 at an intermediate delay time of @xmath110 1 gyr is about 10 times larger than @xmath111 .",
    "it should be noted that the prompt ia population inferred from our data is a considerable fraction ( @xmath112% ) of all sne ia integrated over @xmath0 011 gyr , if we make a modest assumption that @xmath113 at @xmath114 0.1 gyr is constant at the value of @xmath115 .",
    "most of the observed sn ia rate dependence on galaxy properties can be reproduced by a dtd similar to those predicted by the dd scenario ( greggio 2005 ; mannucci et al .",
    "the observed enhancement of sn ia rate in radio galaxies may require an even higher prompt ia fraction than that expected from our data or the dd scenario ( della valle et al .",
    "2005 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2006 ) , if the enhancement is due to a recent starburst connected to agn activity .",
    "however , this interpretation seems to be inconsistent with the fact that no enhancement of cc sn rate is observed in radio galaxies ( greggio , renzini , & daddi 2008 ) .",
    "the statistics of this enhancement is still small ( 2@xmath116 level ) , and it must be confirmed by future observations .",
    "recently , pritchet et al . (",
    "2008 ) reported that dtd proportional to @xmath117 is implied based on the snls data ( sullivan et al .",
    "2006 ) , which seems to be inconsistent with our results .",
    "it should be noted that their constraint on dtd is not based on delay time estimate for each sn ia , but it is indirectly derived from the correlation between sn ia rate per unit galaxy mass ( specific sn ia rate ) and sfr per unit galaxy mass ( specific sfr ) .",
    "it is difficult to estimate how large is the systematic uncertainty in such an analysis .",
    "especially , low specific sfr galaxies should be treated with caution .",
    "there should be no tight relation between specific sn ia rate versus specific sfr in such galaxies ; specific sfr could change significantly by changing sfr with a fixed stellar mass , but specific sn ia rate is hardly affected if it is dominated by old stellar population .",
    "this should limit the power of this approach to constrain dtd .",
    "it should also be noted that the stellar mass estimates in sullivan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are based on five optical bands ( @xmath118 ) , although near - infrared bands are essential to reliably estimate stellar masses of galaxies .",
    "another important point is that we obtained a strong constraint on the slope index @xmath94 by supportively using the sn ia rate in nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "if we fit only our own dtd data , we obtain @xmath119 .",
    "it is important to combine the nearby rate data ( large @xmath8 ) and high-@xmath29 data ( small @xmath8 ) to get a strong constraint on the dtd shape in a wide range of the ia delay time .",
