    "anyons are exotic quasi - particles in two dimensional systems that obey fractional statistics @xcite . by the associative properties of their underlying algebra , they are divided into abelian and non - abelian anyons . under particle exchange , the wavefunction of abelian anyons acquires a phase that can be different than multiples of @xmath0 . for non - abelian anyons ,",
    "the wavefunction is subject to a none diagonal unitary gate when two particles are exchanged @xcite .",
    "anyons are important for understanding the physics of two - dimensional strongly correlated systems and they are speculated to exist in fractional quantum hall fluids @xcite .    aside from their fundamental implications in many - body physics , in recent years anyon systems have been suggested as a promising candidate for realizing intrinsically robust quantum computation because of their topological properties  @xcite . for instance , kitaev proposed two exactly solvable spin lattice models with anyonic excitations , the quantum double model and the honeycomb model @xcite .",
    "these schemes are called topological quantum computation ( tqc ) , and they take advantage of the topological invariance of anyon qubits to protect against local noise .    in spite of the conceptual significance of anyons and their appeal for quantum computation applications ,",
    "it is very difficult to study anyons experimentally because the conditions for their existence and observation are extremely challenging to realize . to date",
    ", there has only been some experimental evidence in support of the existence of abelian anyons in fractional quantum hall fluids @xcite . for the purpose of universal tqc ,",
    "abelian anyons are insufficient and non - abelian anyons must be available . there have been several theoretical proposals for direct observation of non - abelian anyons in quantum hall systems @xcite and the honeycomb model @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these proposals require very complex setup or very low temperatures that are beyond the reach of current experimental capabilities .",
    "considering the difficulty in realizing physical systems with genuine anyonic particles , quantum simulation of anyons is very valuable since it provides a viable alternative for studying the kinematics of topological states . in this practice",
    ", we will not try to construct the complex many - body hamiltonian giving rise to genuine anyons which often involves interactions between more than two physical particles .",
    "rather , the goal is to find practical methods to create topological states in a realizable system and study their properties .",
    "though these states are not truly topologically protected , they can be created , manipulated and observed in a properly designed simulation system , and therefore are very valuable for the study of anyon physics and topological quantum computing .    recognizing the importance of quantum simulation of anyon physics , in recent years researchers have proposed schemes for simulating both the abelian @xcite and non - abelian @xcite quantum double model based on photonic and trapped atomic systems . though these schemes are very valuable for the research of anyon physics , they also have serious limitations . in particular , the issue of using topologically protected manipulations only has not been sufficiently addressed .",
    "for instance , local fluxes and local charges are used in @xcite to encode quantum information and these local degrees of freedom will be disturbed by local noise such as local gauge transformations . in @xcite , though information in the quantum memory is encoded with anyon states , the computing operations are non - topological .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to study new schemes that can demonstrate genuine fractional statistics and simulate topologically protected quantum computing .    in order to simulate anyon states that can truly demonstrate non - abelian statistics and universal tqc",
    ", we must carefully examine the topologically protected space in the system which is the computational hilbert space for tqc . in general , this topologically protected space does not have a tensor product structure and unitary transformations of states in it under braiding can not be described clearly .",
    "consequently , it is unclear how non - abelian statistics is manifested in this space and how it can be used for computation @xcite . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", kitaev suggested that one can use an arbitrary but fixed _ base site _ as a reference @xcite to create anyons . by constructing appropriate ribbon operators that share the chosen base site as one of their ends ( see fig .",
    "[ fig ribbon ] ( a ) ) , one can create anyonic excitations on the other end of the ribbons .",
    "since all these anyonic excitations have the same reference base site , an overall topologically protected space can be constructed as a tensor product of the topologically protected space associated with each ribbon operator @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hilbert space does have a tensor product structure and the transformations of anyon states in it under braiding and fusion can be easily derived .",
    "kitaev s scheme offers a feasible and effective method for performing topologically protected quantum computation .",
    "unfortunately , a scheme to directly simulate this important approach of kitaev s has not been available , since it is nontrivial to construct appropriate ribbon operators required for its realization in a physical system .    in this work ,",
    "we show how to dynamically simulate the @xmath1 non - abelian quantum double model by proposing a scheme to realize ribbon operators connected to a common base site @xmath2 .",
    "we describe how to create anyonic excitations using these ribbon operators , and how to move the other end of the ribbon to achieve the braiding of anyonic excitations on it .",
    "we also demonstrate how to detect the braiding and fusion , and propose a method to realize anyonic interferometry using controlled ribbon operators to detect the topological states of the anyonic excitations . with these capabilities , we can then study the fractional statistics of non - abelian anyons in the quantum double model , and also simulate universal tqc . based on this",
    ", we investigate the minimum scale of a system that is required for proof - of - principle demonstration of our scheme , and propose an implementation using superconducting circuits .",

    "its ground states are invariant under gauge transformations generated by some finite group . in this work ,",

    "for the correction , one needs single qudit unitary operations on system qudits .",
