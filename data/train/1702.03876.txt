    "the flow pattern of a circular line vortex ring , moving by itself in an inviscid incompressible fluid , was first studied by helmholtz @xcite .",

    "multiple coaxial vortex rings exhibit fascinating interactions @xcite .",
    "the interaction of a single vortex ring with a fixed sphere centered on its axis was first studied by dyson @xcite . in the following",
    "we study a single circular vortex ring interacting with a sphere which can move freely along the axis of the ring . when the ring and sphere are widely separated they move independently .",
    "their interaction may be viewed as a collision .",
    "the flow pattern of the fluid at any instant of time can be decomposed into irrotational and rotational contributions . for a fixed sphere",
    "the flow pattern is purely rotational and consists of a helmholtz vortex ring and its image in the sphere , as first found by lewis @xcite .",
    "a moving sphere by itself carries an irrotational dipolar flow pattern . if both ring and sphere are present , then the image ring and the dipolar pattern of the sphere act on the vortex ring .",
    "thus the coaxial sphere and vortex ring constitute a complicated dynamical system . in order to describe its motion we formulate hamiltonian equations of motion .",
    "different types of motion can be analyzed by numerical solution of the four hamiltonian equations .",
    "there are two constants of the motion , the total energy and the total momentum .",
    "we find that there are several distinct types of motion .",
    "depending on the initial conditions the vortex ring can pass over the sphere , widening as it does so .",
    "alternatively , the sphere can pass through the ring and leave it behind . in the latter case the ring also widens during the passing .",
    "there are also situations , where the ring and sphere do not pass , but both slow down as a result of the encounter",
    ".    it would be of interest to study these motions experimentally .",
    "we consider an idealized system where the intrinsic instability and the interaction - induced instability of the vortex ring @xcite are ignored . in a superfluid",
    "vortex rings are particularly stable @xcite .",
    "the motions in such a fluid would be worthy of investigation .",
    "we consider a sphere of radius @xmath0 immersed in an inviscid incompressible fluid of mass density @xmath1 .",

    "the vorticity of the flow is defined as @xmath5 the flow velocity at any time @xmath6 can be expressed as the sum of an irrotational and a rotational flow @xmath7 with scalar potential @xmath8 and vector potential @xmath9 .",
    "the potentials satisfy the equations @xmath10 the last equation represents a convenient choice of gauge . in the following",
    "we do not need to evaluate the pressure .",
    "if the sphere is centered at the origin and moves with translational velocity @xmath11 in infinite fluid then it generates the scalar potential @xcite @xmath12 corresponding to the dipole moment @xmath13 the corresponding poisson flow pattern @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dipolar tensor with unit tensor @xmath17 . the dipole moment",
    "is related to the impulse @xmath18 which is required to accelerate the sphere from rest to velocity @xmath11 by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the effective mass @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the mass of displaced fluid and @xmath23 is the added mass .",
    "the kinetic energy of the flow is evaluated to be @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the outward normal to the spherical surface @xmath26 .",
    "next we consider a single vortex ring centered at the origin in the absence of the sphere and moving along the @xmath27 axis . on account of axial symmetry",
    "it is convenient to use cylindrical coordinates @xmath28 .",
    "then the vector potential can be expressed as @xcite @xmath29 with stream function @xmath30 and azimuthal unit vector @xmath31 . for a circular line vortex of radius @xmath32 and strength",

    "the kinetic energy of the corresponding flow diverges due the assumption that the vorticity is concentrated in a line .",
    "if the line element is expanded into a cylindrical filament of radius @xmath38 with uniform vorticity then for @xmath39 the kinetic energy of the ring vortex is calculated to be @xcite,@xcite,@xcite @xmath40.\\ ] ] this shows that the energy diverges logarithmically as @xmath41 .",

    "is taken to be positive , so that the ring moves in the positive @xmath27 direction .",
    "we must take into account that according to helmholtz s vortex equations @xcite,@xcite the core radius @xmath38 shrinks as @xmath44 with dimensionless constant @xmath45 , as the radius of the ring increases , implying that the volume of the ring is constant .",
    "here we adopted the radius @xmath0 of the sphere as the basic length scale .",
    "the equations of motion can be put in the hamiltonian form @xmath46 with ring hamiltonian given by @xmath47.\\ ] ] the ring hamiltonian takes the value @xmath48 given by eq .",
    "( 2.14 ) with @xmath44 for ring momentum @xmath49 . for an isolated ring",
    "the ring momentum is constant , since @xmath50 does not depend on the position @xmath43 .",
    "if both the sphere and the ring are present , then they interact .",
    "we assume that both are centered on the @xmath27 axis with the ring parallel to the @xmath51 plane .",
    "we denote the @xmath27 coordinate of the sphere center as @xmath52 .",
    "the scalar potential is given by eq .",

    "( 2.11 ) and ( 2.12 ) with @xmath53 replaced by @xmath55 , since we must take account of the kinematic boundary condition that the flow must be tangential to the sphere in its rest syatem .",
    "the total stream function is given by the above expressions plus the corresponding one of an image ring located inside the sphere @xcite .",
    "the total stream function is given by @xmath56 with image coordinates @xmath57 given by @xmath58 the kinetic energy of the corresponding flow pattern is given by @xmath59 where the first term is the self - energy made finite , given by eq .",
    "the second term represents the interaction energy of the vortex ring with its image in the sphere . for large distance of sphere and ring",
    "the second term decays as @xmath60 , so that @xmath61 tends to @xmath48 .",
    "the expression may be compared with dyson s energy equation @xcite .",
    "the left - hand side of his equation ( 117 ) includes the self - energy of the image ring , which equals that of the ring by itself , and also includes the interaction energy twice .",
    "the terms in his energy equation are therefore twice those given in eq .",

    "( 3.2 ) must be used and subsequently @xmath32 must be replaced by @xmath70 . since the hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time , energy is conserved and given by the value of @xmath71 at the phase point @xmath72 considered . since the hamiltonian depends on coordinates @xmath73 only via the difference @xmath74 it is translation - invariant and total momentum @xmath75 is also conserved .",
    "hence we can reduce the problem to motion in a two - dimensional phase space with phase points @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the relative position of ring and sphere .",
    "the equations of motion of the sphere - ring complex reduce to @xmath78 where the reduced hamiltonian @xmath79 is obtained from @xmath71 by substitution of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
