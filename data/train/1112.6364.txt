    "the latest searches for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson performed by the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc have come up with tantalizing hints of the particle  @xcite .",
    "they observed modest excesses of events compatible with a sm higgs @xmath0 having mass @xmath1 in the range from 124 to 126  gev , but the statistical significance of the excesses is not enough for making any conclusive statement on the higgs existence or nonexistence  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these numbers are consistent with @xmath7  gev from the sm complete fit to electroweak precision data plus constraints from direct higgs searches at lep and tevatron  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , if upcoming measurements confirm these preliminary findings at the lhc to be glimpses of the sm higgs , or a sm - like higgs , the implications will be far - reaching for efforts to extend the sm , as physics beyond the sm is still necessary to account for , among other things , the observed evidence for dark matter .",
    "particularly , all new - physics models would have to include such a  spinless boson as one of their ingredients .    simultaneously with the quest for the higgs , a number of underground experiments have for years been searching directly for weakly interacting massive particle  ( wimp ) dark matter  ( dm ) by looking for the recoil energy of nuclei caused by wimps colliding with nucleons .",
    "intriguingly , some of these searches have turned up excess events which may have been wimp signals .",
    "specifically , the dama , cogent , and cresst - ii collaborations  @xcite have acquired data that seem to be pointing to light wimps of mass in the region roughly from  5  to  30  gev and spin - independent wimp - nucleon scattering cross - sections of order @xmath8 to @xmath9  @xmath10 , although the respective ranges preferred by these experiments do not fully agree with each other .",
    "in contrast , other direct searches , especially by the cdms , xenon , and simple collaborations  @xcite , still have not produced any wimp evidence .",
    "although presently for wimp masses under 15gev the latter null results are still controversial  @xcite and future wimp searches with improved sensitivity may eventually settle this issue definitively , there may be alternative explanations worth exploring which can reconcile these disagreeing findings on  dm .",
    "since the various dm searches employed different target materials for wimp detection , one of the possible resolutions to the light - dm controversy that have been proposed is to allow large isospin violation in the wimp - nucleon interactions  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the tension between the conflicting direct - search results can be partially eased if the effective wimp couplings @xmath11 and @xmath12 to the proton and neutron , respectively , satisfy the ratio  @xmath13  @xcite .    in view of these developments in the hunts for the higgs and for  dm ,",
    "it is of interest to consider some of their implications within the context of a relatively simple framework . for if the two sectors are intimately connected , detecting the signs of one of them could shine light on still hidden elements of the other .",
    "the most economical model possessing both a higgs boson and a wimp candidate is the  sm+d , which is the sm expanded with the addition of a real gauge - singlet scalar field @xmath2 dubbed darkon acting as the  wimp  @xcite .",
    "this model predicts that the higgs decay for @xmath14 - 130gev is highly dominated by the invisible mode @xmath4 if the darkon mass  @xmath3 , except when @xmath5 is close to , but less than ,  @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "thus , if a  higgs with @xmath15gev  and characteristics within the sm preference manifests itself unambiguously in lhc data , the parameter space of the sm+d with a light darkon will be strongly diminished . on the other hand , for @xmath16",
    "the model is consistent with the existence of such a  higgs , as its decay pattern is unaffected at leading order by the presence of the darkon , although limited portions of this @xmath5 zone are already excluded by direct - search data .    in order to have a higgs compatible with the lhc indications as well as a light - wimp candidate",
    ", one must therefore expand the  sm+d .",
    "this motivates us to study in this paper a  slightly extended model we call thdm+d , which is a two - higgs - doublet model combined with a darkon .",
    "it can offer such a  higgs and an ample amount of viable parameter space for the darkon .",
    "the model can also supply isospin - violating wimp - nucleon interactions at about the desired level , although this will require fine - tuning to some extent .",
    "in addition , the potential presence of tree - level flavor - changing couplings of the neutral higgs bosons in the thdm+d implies that the higgs - mediated top - quark decays @xmath17 , if kinematically allowed , would contribute to the decays @xmath18 plus missing energy .",
    "if these decays have rates that are sufficiently amplified to be measurable at the  lhc , they can be another avenue to probe the darkon  @xcite .    in the next section , we consider in more detail some implications of the possible discovery of a  higgs having sm - like properties for the sm+d with either three or four sequential generations of fermions ( hereafter referred to as sm3+d or sm4+d , respectively ) . in  sec.[thdm+d ]",
    "we describe the thdm+d with a sm - like higgs and study its prediction for wimp - nucleon cross - sections in the limit that isospin violation is negligible in the wimp - nucleon effective couplings . in  sec.[ivdm ] we treat the thdm+d case with isospin - violating wimp - nucleon interactions .",
    "we give our conclusions in  sec.[concl ] .",
    "in the dm sector of the sm+d , to ensure the stability of the darkon @xmath2 as the  dm , one assumes it to be a singlet under the gauge groups of the model and introduces a  @xmath19 symmetry under which @xmath20 , all the other fields being unaffected . requiring that the darkon lagrangian be renormalizable",
    "then implies that it has the form  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are free parameters and @xmath25 is the higgs doublet containing the physical higgs field  @xmath0 , in the notation of ref.@xcite which has additional details on the model .",
    "clearly its darkon sector has very few free parameters , only two of which , besides @xmath1 , are relevant here : the higgs - darkon coupling  @xmath24 , which determines the darkon relic density , and the darkon mass  @xmath26 , where @xmath27gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) .    as explained recently in ref.@xcite , constraints on the darkon in the sm+d ( either sm3+d or  sm4+d ) from a number of rare meson decays with missing energy and from dm direct searches , pending a definitive resolution to the light - wimp puzzle ,",
    "allow the darkon mass values @xmath28gev consistent with the light - wimp hypothesis and those not far from , but smaller than ,  @xmath6 .",
    "for such masses , the invisible decay mode @xmath29 can dominate the higgs total width depending on  @xmath1 , making the higgs still hidden from detection , and as a  consequence significant portions of the @xmath1 ranges in the sm3  ( sm4 ) excluded by the current lhc data may be made viable again in the  sm3+d  ( sm4+d ) .     as a function of darkon mass @xmath5 for higgs mass @xmath30gev in  sm3+d .",

    "the theory curve is roughly independent of @xmath139 if it is in the hundreds of  gev .",
    "one can see that the prediction is not able to reach the ( gray ) region implied by dama at the  3@xmath32 level and only marginally covers its @xmath189 ( lighter gray ) region .",
    "the cogent preferred ( magenta ) area is also unreachable .",
    "nevertheless , with respect to many points in these regions , the prediction is too low by no more than a factor of  2  or  3 . on the other hand , with appropriately lowered @xmath190",
    ", it can agree well with the cross sections ( cyan patch ) favored by the cresst - ii results .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath5 values below 10gev or so the prediction curve does not conflict with the xenon limits , which is unlike the isospin - symmetric case illustrated in fig.[lambda_2hdm+d ] .",
    "the situation is very different when it comes to the limit from simple which now rules out @xmath191gev , while previously it allowed most of the darkon parameter space . on the experimental side , due to  @xmath162 , virtually none of the cresst - ii area in  fig.[lambda_2hdm+d ] is consistent with the dama and cogent ones any more , and the simple bound disallows most of the cogent area .",
    "it is obvious from a  comparison of figs .",
    "[ lambda_2hdm+d](c ) and  [ cs - ivdm ] that there are unresolved puzzles remaining . to address them in a comprehensive manner",
    "would likely have to await future direct - searches with improved precision and may need to involve extra ingredients  @xcite beyond the simple frameworks treated in this work .",
    "we now demonstrate that the result above for the enhanced @xmath154 prediction does not depend on the value of @xmath192 or the pion - nucleon sigma term  @xmath38 , assuming that @xmath190 are much bigger than the other  @xmath134 . as discussed in  appendix[eff ] , the requirements @xmath193 and  @xmath194 result in @xmath195 and also @xmath196 according to  eq.([kdh ] ) .",
    "hence for @xmath197 and  @xcite @xmath198mev @xmath199 approximately independent of @xmath38 . since now @xmath200 and @xmath201 are both roughly proportional to @xmath202 , the approximate expression @xmath203 derived from eqs .",
    "( [ csel ] ) and  ( [ csan ] ) and valid for @xmath204 , is roughly independent of @xmath205 .",
    "consequently , @xmath154 can only be increased further if @xmath206 is also increased .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that one can not obtain the substantial isospin violation of interest if the higgs sector of the thdm+d is of type ii , in which the up- and down - type quarks are coupled to different higgs doublets  @xcite . in that case , the second term in each of the formulas for @xmath134 in eq.([kh ] ) is absent , and therefore there is not much freedom to vary  @xmath134 , as @xmath123 can not be arbitrarily small or big due to restrictions from various data  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , since the darkon - nucleon couplings are dominated by the combined strange- and heavy - quark contributions , which conserve isospin , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ gnnh ] ) and  ( [ fq ] ) , the darkon - proton coupling can not be made large enough after applying the relic density and @xmath207 restraints .",
    "we have found that the resulting darkon - proton cross - section @xmath154 for @xmath208gev can not reach more than @xmath36@xmath209 , about 5 orders of magnitude too small .",
    "the preliminary indications of a higgs boson with sm - like properties in the latest lhc data , if confirmed by future measurements , will have important implications for wimp dark matter models .",
    "we have explored a number of such implications for some of the simplest darkon models . for the simplest one , sm3+d ,",
    "most of the light - darkon mass range will be ruled out if an sm3-like higgs with mass near 125gev is found .",
    "such a discovery would also be at odds with the sm4 higgs expectations , thus disfavoring the sm4+d .",
    "in contrast , the type - iii two - higgs - doublet model enlarged with the addition of a darkon has an abundance of allowed parameter space in its dm sector .",
    "it can accommodate an  sm3-like higgs and simultaneously offers a wimp candidate in harmony with the light - wimp hypothesis inspired by the clues from a number of dm searches , although it is in conflict with the null results of other searches .",
    "the model can also provide substantial isospin violation in the wimp - nucleon interactions which can alleviate some of this tension in the data on light dm .",
    "however , this could be achieved only with some amount of fine - tuning in several of the relevant parameters .",
    "nevertheless , upcoming searches for the higgs at the lhc and future dm direct searches can test further the thdm+d which we have considered . additional signals of the darkon in this scenario may be available from flavor - changing top - quark decays into lighter up - type quarks with missing energy which are potentially observable at the  lhc .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsc of roc , nnsf and sjtu 985 grants of prc , and ncu plan to develop first - class universities and top - level research centers .",
    "the effective coupling of a higgs @xmath210 to a proton @xmath211 or neutron @xmath212 is related to the quark yukawa parameters by  @xcite @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the dirac spinor for @xmath215 and the sum is over all quarks . using the chiral lagrangian approach described in ref.@xcite , but without neglecting isospin violation , and assuming three fermion families , we obtain @xmath216 where the parameters @xmath217 and @xmath218 can be fixed from the measured masses of the lightest baryons and the phenomenological or lattice value of the pion - nucleon sigma term  @xmath38 . since @xmath38 is still poorly determined  @xcite , we take @xmath219mev after  ref.@xcite . hence for @xmath220mev the values of @xmath221",
    "are , in units of @xmath222 , @xmath223    in the following we assume that @xmath224 , the other  @xmath134 are zero , and @xmath225 as in  eq.([n = rp ] ) , with @xmath226 being a  constant . combining these requirements with some of the preceding equations , we arrive at @xmath227",
    "numerically we get @xmath228mev , which in this case leads to @xmath229 in evaluating these quantities and @xmath230 in eq.([csan ] ) , we have employed the running masses of the light quarks at scales @xmath231gev and @xmath232 , respectively , and included qcd corrections in the @xmath233 rates  @xcite .",
    "the ratios of light - quark masses used are @xmath234 and @xmath235 , which fall within their measured ranges  @xcite .",
