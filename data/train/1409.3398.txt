    "our treatment here essentially reproduces the derivations presented already in ref.@xcite ( especially in appendix a ) with slight generalizations accommodating for the unbalanced central beamsplitter used in the present experiment .",
    "consider a signal - recycled michelson - sagnac interferometer ( msi ) as shown in fig.[pic_msr_interferometer ] with a central beamsplitter bs having amplitude reflectivity @xmath46 and transmissivity @xmath47 , two steering mirrors @xmath48 and @xmath49 both having 100% reflectivity , a semitransparent membrane m with amplitude reflectivity @xmath50 and transmissivity @xmath51 , and a signal - recycling mirror sr with amplitude reflectivity @xmath52 and transmissivity @xmath53 .",
    "the interferometer is driven by a laser l through the laser port .",
    "photons emanating through the other , detector port impinge on a detector d. we denote the distance between sr mirror and bs as @xmath54 , the arm length as @xmath55 and the distances between folding mirrors @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the membrane as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath58 , @xmath59 and the position of the membrane on the @xmath60-axis is @xmath61 .",
    "the total mean length of the sr - m path is @xmath62 .",
    "in any spatial location inside the interferometer we decompose the electric field of the coherent , plane and linearly polarized electromagnetic wave into the sum of a steady - state ( mean ) field with amplitude @xmath63 and carrier frequency @xmath64 ( wavenumber @xmath65 and wavelength @xmath66 ) , and slowly - varying ( on the scale of @xmath67 ) perturbation field with amplitude @xmath68 describing vacuum noises and the contribution from the motion of the membrane , @xmath69 + \\textrm{{h.c.}},\\\\      a(t)&=\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}a(\\omega_0+\\omega)e^{-i\\omega t}\\,\\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath70 is the area of laser beam s cross - section and @xmath71 is the speed of light .",
    "unless mentioned explicitly , we will deal with fields in the frequency domain only and omit frequency arguments for briefness .",
    "the laser l emits a drive - wave @xmath72 with mean amplitude @xmath73 and optical fluctuations @xmath74 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that there are no technical fluctuations so that the laser is shot - noise limited , @xmath75=2\\pi\\delta(\\omega-\\omega')$ ] .",
    "the vacuum field @xmath76 entering through the sr mirror ( srm ) from detector port has zero mean amplitude but non - zero vacuum noise @xmath77 , uncorrelated with vacuum noise from the laser port and obeying the similar commutation relation @xmath78=2\\pi\\delta(\\omega-\\omega')$ ] .",
    "we unite these into a vector - column of input fields @xmath79 , so that the vector of mean input fields is @xmath80 and the vector of perturbation fields is @xmath81 . due to the linearity of the system input fields can be propagated throughout the interferometer as independent fourier components .",
    "consider first the case without srm and with a fixed membrane .",
    "the latter condition allows us to treat mean and perturbation fields on equal footing .",
    "input fields ( in this case coinciding with the fields incident on the beamsplitter ) linearly transform into the output fields : @xmath82 here @xmath83 are the transformation matrices of beamsplitter and membrane , each chosen in the form most convenient for calculations ( as distinct from ref.@xcite where the membrane matrix was chosen to be real ) , and @xmath84 are the propagation matrices comprising the phase shifts along the horizontal / vertical arms ( of length @xmath55 ) and diagonal half - arms ( of lengths @xmath85 ) . for",
    "mean fields one should apply the substitution @xmath86 and for perturbation fields @xmath87 .",
    "the matrix @xmath88 thus represents the transformation matrix of a non - recycled msi , @xmath89 with    @xmath90    physically @xmath91 is the msi amplitude reflectivity and @xmath92 is the amplitude transmissivity , such that @xmath93 .",
    "thus , a non - recycled msi can be described as an effective mirror with reflectivity and transmissivity dependent on membrane position via @xmath94 ( cf .",
    "the dark port ( dark fringe ) condition for the interferometer corresponds to a choice for the membrane postion @xmath94 such that @xmath95 , @xmath96    if the srm is inserted then the out - going field in the sr port is reflected back , such that the in - going fields incident on the beamsplitter are defined by the equation @xmath97 here @xmath98 is the vector - column of in - going beamsplitter fields ( see fig.[pic_msr_interferometer ] ) , @xmath99 with zero standing for the absence of power - recycling mirror in laser port , @xmath100 is the propagation matrix in bs - sr path , and @xmath101 .",
    "thus the first summand on the rhs of eq.([eq_bs_fields_immov_membr ] ) stands for the input fields directly incident on the beamsplitter , while the second summand corresponds to a single round trip along the interferometer with reflection from the srm .",
    "solution of this equation yields @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the @xmath104 unity matrix .",
    "we denote the inverse matrix in this solution as @xmath105 , @xmath106 this tells us that the msi with srm makes an effective fabry - perot cavity with associated resonance factor @xmath107 , where @xmath108    note that the effective detuning of the laser carrier frequency from cavity resonance(s ) is not solely defined by the corresponding shift in frequency ( or cavity length ) in contrast to the ordinary fabry - perot cavity .",
    "denote @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the phase of reflectivity of the msi operated on dark port , and @xmath111 is the deviation from it due to offset from dark port via membrane positioning and asymmetry of the beamsplitter .",
    "assume that the following condition is satisfied on dark port : @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is fixed integer and @xmath114 .",
    "this equation defines the detuning @xmath115 as the difference between the laser carrier frequency @xmath64 and the @xmath113-th resonance @xmath116 of the msi - srm cavity when msi is set on dark port : @xmath117 this detuning can be generated either via tuning of the carrier frequency or via positioning of the srm . in the latter case",
    "the detuning depends on the displacement @xmath118 of the srm linearly , @xmath119 .",
    "however , when the msi is operated off dark port ( @xmath120 ) , we need to introduce an additional detuning @xmath121 associated with this offset via the equation @xmath122 , from where it follows that @xmath123 .",
    "this detuning depends intricately on the position of the membrane and beamsplitter asymmetry @xmath124 for the arbitrary offset from dark fringe , but for @xmath125 and @xmath126 it can be calculated explicitly @xmath127,\\ ] ] where the sign depends on the choice of a particular dark fringe from eq.([eq_dark_port_condition ] ) .",
    "note that in ref.@xcite this detuning was denoted as @xmath128 , since the beamsplitter was considered as perfectly balanced , so the offset form dark fringe could be generated solely via membrane positioning .",
    "having defined the two contributions , the total detuning can now be introduced as @xmath129 and the inverse resonance factor ( for mean fields ) now reads , @xmath130 it follows from this equation that the half - linewidth of the msi - srm cavity , @xmath131 , in the narrow - band approximation , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , also has two contributions : @xmath134 therefore , the total cavity linewidth accounts for finite srm transmittance and finite transmittance of the msi operated off dark port ; since @xmath135 , the latter contribution describes modulation of the linewidth by the motion of the membrane , thus implementing dissipative coupling in the effective cavity , as discussed in @xcite . optical losses in the recycled interferometer can be described by adding an effective loss factor to the srm transmittance , @xmath136 .",

    "<S> , optomechanics was mainly investigated in the limit of strongly dominant dispersive coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this regime , however , shows significant constraints . </S>",
    "<S> first , optical ground - state cooling @xcite , so far , is based on dispersive coupling , and thus requires a red - detuned light field and a cavity whose linewidth is smaller than the mechanical frequency ( sideband - resolved regime ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these requirements are unfeasible for low mechanical frequencies , i.e.  in the interesting regime of macroscopic and heavy oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> second , designs of next - generation gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors with sensitivities enhanced by the optical spring @xcite consider only dispersive coupling so far @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spring , however , was found to be inherently unstable @xcite , which results in uncontrolled motions of the pendulum - suspended mirrors , and requires a yet - to - be - developed control system in order to exploit optomechanical effects for achieving sensitivities beyond the sql . </S>",
    "<S> generalized optomechanical systems with significant contributions from both dispersive and dissipative couplings significantly broaden the scope of optomechanics . in such systems , strong optical cooling on cavity resonance is predicted , making the sideband - resolved regime @xcite unnecessary . in refs . </S>",
