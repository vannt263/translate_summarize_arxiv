    "a fair estimate of metal abundance in stellar systems still remains a central issue for any detailed assessment of the other cluster distinctive properties .",
    "metallicity modulates , in fact , both effective temperature and apparent colors of stars , while the internal composition affects the nuclear engine , and therefore stellar lifetime . even in case of resolved stellar systems , this entangled behavior may lead to a biased interpretation of cluster age , based on the cmd morphology , an effect often referred to as the `` age - metallicity dilemma '' @xcite .",
    "such induced age uncertainty also reflects in the distance determination of star clusters , as far as one tries to compare the apparent magnitude of the main sequence turn off ( to ) point with the appropriate theoretical luminosity to derive therefrom the distance modulus .",
    "one further difficulty also deals with the proper assessment of dust reddening , that may affect cmd morphology leading , in general , to an artificially enhanced value of [ fe / h].}$ ] @xcite . ]    to overcome these problems , one would like to preliminarily derive the cluster metallicity from accurate abundance analysis of individual stars ( typically red giants , due to their brighter intrinsic luminosity at optical wavelengths ) through high - resolution spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this delicate task , however , is extremely time consuming , and a far more straight shortcut is often pursued relying on integrated cluster spectroscopy , usually taken at much lower resolution .",
    "narrow - band spectrophotometric indices , as derived from integrated low - res ( @xmath2  6 - 8    fwhm ) observations , usually provide the basic diagnostic scheme to match theoretical models from stellar population synthesis and derive therefrom cluster properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lick system @xcite stands out as the widest and most popular reference , assuring a systematic coverage of the main spectral features across the 41006400    wavelength range , easily accessible from ground - based observations .    besides the advantage of this strategy , one can still question whether it effectively allows us to disentangle any age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "in fact , integrated indices are sensitive both to intrinsic elemental abundance and to the temperature distribution of the underlying stellar population , thus delivering a composite and likely non - univocal piece of information ( see a discussion in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative , and possibly more proficient way out , at least for resolved stellar clusters , can be envisaged and will be explored in this paper .",
    "it relies on a minimal `` tuned '' sampling of individual red giant stars of a cluster , observed at low spectral resolution such as to derive the maximum strength for the fe5270 index , which is by far the most popular one among the several fe  i features included in the lick system . as we will see in sect .  2 , for their special physical properties ,",
    "fe  i features prove to be ideal candidates for a reliable `` snapshot '' estimate of stellar system metallicity .",
    "our method complements previous studies in the same line .",
    "for example , by relying on low - resolution near - ir observations of the strong ca  ii triplet among rgb stars , @xcite and @xcite recently recovered the [ fe / h ] value for the smc and its cluster system within less than a 0.2  dex uncertainty compared , for instance , to the high - res analysis of @xcite .    in the following discussion , we will outline our method in sect .  3 , and propose a plain theoretical calibration based on population synthesis models .",
    "theoretical predictions will be compared with a grid of galactic globular and open clusters spanning the whole range of metallicity . in sect .",
    "4 we will summarize our conclusions and also briefly outline further applications of the method , also in view of the deeper forthcoming surveys of external stellar systems ( i.e. , extragalactic star clusters around and within nearby galaxies in the local group , etc . ) taken with the new - generation telescopes .",
    "extended grids of synthetic stellar spectra , from which to derive lick - index behavior vs.  @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and [ fe / h ] , have been computed , among others , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in addition ,",
    "semi - empirical calibrations based on more or less complete samples of disk stars are due , among others , to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter results are often summarized in analytical sets of so - called `` fitting functions '' .",
    "both approaches resulted in a complementary contribution as far as the physical behavior of the different spectral features vs.  stellar fundamental parameters is concerned . in this respect ,",
    "a recognized advantage of synthetic spectra is to directly explore index changes within a `` controlled '' grid of input parameters .",
    "however , models are still largely inadequate in their physical treatment of cool stars , ( i.e. , @xmath5  k , including late - k and m spectral types ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , when convection and the increasing effect of molecular opacity severely perturb the atmosphere structure and the emerging spectral energy distribution of stars at optical wavelength .    from its side",
    ", the empirical fitting - function technique has the advantage of giving a simple and accurate summary of index behavior across the full parameter domain of real stars .",
    "this partly overcomes any modeling uncertainty , and the analytical set of equations can easily be implemented in theoretical models of stellar populations to compute the integrated indices of a system without requiring any spectral input for individual stars @xcite . as a drawback of this approach",
    ", however , one has to remark the evident limitation of any empirical star sample ( forcedly dominated by a component of solar neighbors ) to properly probe the full metallicity scale outside the solar range .      among the set of lick indices in the optical wavelength range , the fe  i lines reveal potentially the most promising ones for the present analysis",
    "this is especially true for the fe5270 feature , that begins to appear in stars cooler than @xmath6  k and reaches a maximum equivalent width about 42004600  k @xcite .",
    "the latter is the typical temperature of faint low - main sequence dwarfs and , most importantly , also of bright mk  iii giants , which populate the agb / rgb region of the cmd diagram .",
    "although not so prominent , the fe5270 feature ( and its close neighbor fe5335 ) can easily be recognized also in the integrated spectra of elliptical galaxies @xcite , and its presence is known to trace the relative contribution of low - rgb stars in the galaxy stellar population @xcite .    from bluered synthetic stellar spectra of model atmospheres with @xmath7  dex and solar metallicity ( dots ) .",
    "square markers trace the raw fe5270 index trend by neglecting the tio molecular opacity . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : index_tio ] we explored in finer detail the fe5270 diagnostic properties from the theoretical point of view , by means of an _ ad hoc _ grid of bluered synthetic spectra @xcite .",
    "spectral synthesis relied on synthe code @xcite and the grid of atlas9 revised model atmospheres @xcite along the 35004500  k @xmath8  range . for @xmath9",
    "k , the main contributor to line blanketing , along the three wavelength bands that define the index , is found to be fe  i , with a fine structure of more than 200 lines ; particularly strong is , of course , the @xmath105269.5 line .",
    "however , in this temperature regime , also important is the contribution of neutral titanium and chromium and , secondly , calcium and cobalt .",
    "the tio opacity becomes increasingly stronger with decreasing temperature , and becomes dominant for @xmath11  k. as a result , the prevailing effect of the tio molecular bands on the fe5270 index is in the sense of depressing the red - side pseudo - continuum , thus reducing the apparent strength of the index .",
    "according to the models , one may even conclude that the tio molecule is actually the main responsible for constraining in temperature the fe5270 peak value ( see , again , fig .",
    "[ fig : index_tio ] ) .",
    "we can probe index sensitivity also by means of empirical data . from the @xcite fitting function",
    "we can write in fact : @xmath12 } + 0.25 \\log g + 3.80 , \\label{eq : fe52}\\ ] ] that fairly well compares with the bluered theoretical prediction , dependence of the bluered synthetic index has perhaps to be considered as an upper limit , as molecular absorption in the relevant wavelength range should likely be stronger than predicted by models at solar and super - solar metallicity . according to our experiments",

    "for example , any change of one dex in @xmath17 only contributes at most by @xmath18    to the fe5270@xmath0 variation . in terms of overall properties of a stellar aggregate ,",
    "this figure reflects in a change of to stellar mass of roughly 0.3 dex , which implies a variation of nearly one order of magnitude in stellar lifetime . therefore , as a major conclusion",
    ", we have that fe5270@xmath0 in a stellar population _",
    "is nearly independent from age_.    a comparison of the different calibrations is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , where we report the output index for two reference values of stellar gravity ( namely , @xmath19 and 3 dex ) appropriate for red giants . within a remarkably good agreement among the different datasets , compared to @xcite calibration ,",

    "in addition to its direct sensitivity to [ fe / h ] , a major supplementary advantage of using fe5270 feature as metallicity tracer in stellar populations resides in the special property of the index to always peak _ within _ the temperature range sampled by red giants in stellar systems richer than [ fe / h ]  @xmath22  dex .",
    "conversely , this is not the case , for instance , of other stronger features , used to derive popular indices like the lick mg@xmath23 or the near - ir cat triplet index @xcite .",
    "both these features peak , in fact , among giants and dwarfs at the coolest temperature tail of each cmds , and their dependence on ssp metallicity is , therefore , naturally prone to more entangled age effects and to other model - dependent features , such as convection and mass loss properties ( both constraining the agb / rgb tip location ) .    the fe5270@xmath0 location for the illustrative case of different simple stellar populations ( ssps ) , with varying either age or [ fe / h ] , is shown in fig .",
    "a glance to the figure makes clear that fe5270 homogeneously probes the ubiquitous component of k1-k3  iii stars within each stellar system .",
    "the collection of empirical estimates of fe5270@xmath0 for several open and globular clusters of the galaxy , according to the @xcite database , is summarized in fig .",
    "these results are collected in table  1 , where we report for each cluster the strongest value reached by the fe5270 index among the sampled stars , together with the sample size in each system , and the adopted cluster metallicity .",
    "note that , as fe5270 strength peaks among increasingly brighter red giants with decreasing metallicity ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) , just a handful set of bright stars in metal - poor globular clusters is sufficient to suitably pick up fe5270@xmath0 .",
    "a slightly deeper spectroscopy is required , instead , for metal - rich systems , but even in this case a dozen of stars taken at low spectral resolution are fully sufficient to suitably constrain the index tip . as an interesting example , in this regard , we also overplot in fig .",
