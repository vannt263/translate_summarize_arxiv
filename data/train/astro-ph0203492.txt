    "two key ingredients in the formation of galactic disks are dissipation and rotation .",
    "dissipation by radiative cooling causes the gas in a protogalaxy to collapse inward ; rotation then halts the collapse in the directions perpendicular but not parallel to the overall angular - momentum vector , resulting in a thin centrifugally supported disk .",
    "other processes likely to play some role in the formation and subsequent evolution of galactic disks include dynamical friction , internal torques , kinematic viscosity , mergers , and star formation and the associated heating and stirring of the gas ( feedback ) . in this article",
    ", we consider the general cosmogonic scenario in which the extended halos of galaxies form hierarchically by the gravitational clustering of non - dissipative dark matter , and the luminous components of galaxies form by a combination of the gravitational clustering and dissipative collapse of baryons , as proposed by white & rees ( 1978 ) .",
    "the formation of galactic disks and the origin of their rotation in this scenario were first studied by fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) .",
    "most of the currently popular models of galaxy formation , including all variants of the cold and warm dark matter ( cdm and wdm ) models , are specific versions of this general scenario .",
    "the formation of objects by gravitational clustering automatically endows them with some angular momentum ( peebles 1969 ) . this is because the ( proto)objects initially have irregular shapes and hence non - zero quadrupole moments . they therefore exert tidal torques on each other , with random strengths and directions .",
    "the objects acquire most of their angular momentum in the translinear regime , when their density contrasts are appreciable ( @xmath0 ) , but before they reach their maximum sizes and begin to contract . the rotation induced by tidal torques is usually quantified in terms of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the total angular momentum , energy , and mass of the object , and @xmath5 is the gravitational constant .",
    "rapidly rotating objects , such as disks , have @xmath6 , whereas slowly rotating objects , such as spheroids , have @xmath7 .",
    "cosmological @xmath8-body simulations have revealed that the distribution of spins induced by gravitational clustering alone ( i.e. , without dissipation ) is approximately lognormal : @xmath9 ^ 2     \\bigg\\ } d \\ln\\lambda , \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] with @xmath10 most objects rotate slowly although there is a wide range of spins .",
    "this distribution appears to be nearly universal in the sense that it has little or no dependence on the cosmological parameters , the initial spectrum of density perturbation , or the masses and densities of the objects ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; zurek , quinn , & salmon 1988 ; warren et al .",
    "1992 ; cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "these results are very useful , even if they are not yet fully understood theoretically .",
    "we can relate the factor by which the baryons collapse in the radial direction before they reach centrifugal balance in a disk to the initial rotation of a protogalaxy as follows ( fall 1983 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a galaxy with a luminous disk ( d ) and a dark halo ( h ) but not a luminous spheroid .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the baryons destined to become the disk receive the same tidal torques as the dark matter before much dissipation occurs and that during and after the collapse the total specific angular momentum of each component is conserved : @xmath11 in other words , we assume for now that angular momentum is not transferred between the disk and the halo , or if it is , that this is accompanied by the transfer of enough mass ( outflow or inflow ) that equation  ( 4 ) is still satisfied .",
    "we approximate the disk by an exponential model with a scale radius @xmath12 ( sometimes denoted by @xmath13 ) and the halo by a singular isothermal sphere with a circular velocity @xmath14 and a truncation radius @xmath15 .",
    "then , neglecting the self - gravity of the disk , we have @xmath16 @xmath17 equating these gives a very simple relation between the collapse factor @xmath18 of the baryons in the disk and the spin parameter @xmath19 of the halo : @xmath20 this implies @xmath21 for @xmath22 and hence @xmath23  kpc for a typical spiral galaxy like the milky way ( with @xmath24  kpc ) .",
    "the collapse factor is larger in halos with smaller spin parameters and smaller in halos with larger spin parameters .",
    "the collapse factor would also be larger if the baryons were to lose some of their specific angular momentum .",
    "equation  ( 7 ) is an excellent approximation even when the halo has a finite core radius and when the self - gravity of the disk is included ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ; see their fig .",
    "it is also a good approximation if the halo has an nfw profile ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 , 1997 ) that is later deformed by the ( adiabatic ) contraction of the disk within it ( mo , mao , & white 1998 ) .",
    "the radius @xmath15 of the halo in equation  ( 7 ) should be the one within which the baryons have collapsed onto the disk .",
    "this may be compared and contrasted with the radius @xmath25 within which the mean density of the protogalaxy is 200 times the critical ( closure ) density .",
    "the latter is near the transition between the virialized and infalling parts of the halo ( cole & lacey 1996 ) . in recent work in this field , it has been customary to identify @xmath15 with @xmath25 .",
    "this assumption , however , does not have much physical justification beyond the constraint @xmath26 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath15 depends on cooling , heating , and other non - gravitational processes at least as much as it depends on the gravitational clustering that determines @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we have no guarantee that @xmath15 and @xmath25 will be equal or even proportional to each other .",
    "( anyone who doubts this should compare the cooling and virial radii in clusters of galaxies . )",
    "the properties of the halos that form in a hierarchy by gravitational clustering obey some simple scaling relations .",
    "we can combine these with the relation between the collapse factor and the spin parameter to derive the corresponding scaling relations for the properties of galactic disks as follows ( fall 1983 ) .",
    "we approximate the relation between the typical masses @xmath27 of the halos ( within @xmath15 ) and their circular velocities @xmath14 by a power law , @xmath28 .",
    "the index @xmath29 depends in general on the initial spectrum of density perturbations , the cosmological parameters , the range of masses considered , and the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath25 .",
    "simple arguments based on the different formation times of objects with different mean densities give @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "this implies @xmath32 for the effective index @xmath33 of the cdm spectrum on galactic scales ( blumenthal et al .  1984 ) .",
    "@xmath8-body simulations indicate instead @xmath34 for the nfw halos in cdm cosmogonies ( navarro et al .",
    "this index is appropriate for @xmath35 and hence for perfectly synchronous formation . in view of the unknown initial spectrum ( index @xmath36 ) and unknown relation between @xmath15 and @xmath25 ,",
    "we regard @xmath29 as a parameter with some theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the scaling relation for the halos can be reexpressed in terms of the typical luminosities and circular velocities of the disks as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ratio of masses of the disks and halos , and @xmath39 is the mass - to - light ratio in the disks .",
    "this may be compared with the observed tully - fisher ( 1977 ) relation , @xmath40 , the index of which varies from @xmath41 in the @xmath42 band ( 0.44 @xmath43 m ) to @xmath44 in the @xmath45 band ( 2.2 @xmath43 m ) ( verheijen 2001 ) .",
    "most of this variation can be explained by a dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath14 , indicated by the observed correlation between the colors and the luminosities of galaxies .",
    "when this effect , including the mass of interstellar gas , is taken into account , the index of the baryonic tully - fisher relation is found to be @xmath47 for @xmath48 ( bell & de jong 2001 ) .",
    "the central surface brightness of an exponential disk is given by @xmath49 .",
    "using equations  ( 7 ) and ( 8) and the relation @xmath50 , we can rewrite this in the form @xmath51 where all of the dependence on @xmath52 and @xmath46 is contained in the factor @xmath53 .",
    "the second proportionality holds because the spin parameters of the halos are statistically independent of their other properties . for @xmath54",
    ", we expect @xmath55 in the @xmath42 band ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath56 in the @xmath45 band ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the first of these is the same as the original freeman ( 1970 ) relation in the @xmath42 band .",
    "it would be interesting to search for the predicted correlation in the @xmath45 band .",
    "the scaling relations above indicate how the typical luminosities and surface brightnesses of galactic disks depend on their circular velocities .",
    "the dispersions about these relations are determined in part by the dispersion in the spin parameter .",
    "we expect the @xmath57-@xmath14 correlation to have relatively little scatter because it is independent of @xmath19 [ equation  ( 8) ] , while we expect the @xmath58-@xmath14 correlation to have a great deal of scatter because it includes the factor @xmath59 [ equation  ( 9 ) ] .",
    "these trends are qualitatively consistent with the observed tully - fisher and freeman relations .",
    "the distribution of @xmath58 at fixed @xmath14 can be derived from equation  ( 2 ) for @xmath60 and equation  ( 7 ) for @xmath18 ( dalcanton , spergel , & summers 1997 ; mo et al .",
    "1998 ; weil , eke , & efstathiou 1998 ) .",
    "these results can then be combined with the luminosity function of galaxies to derive the joint distributions of @xmath58 and @xmath12 ( dalcanton et al .",
    "1997 ) and @xmath57 and @xmath12 ( de jong & lacey 2000 ) .",
    "in all these studies , the observed distributions are reproduced quite well provided the coefficient in equation  ( 7 ) is reasonably close to @xmath61 , i.e. , provided the disks have retained most of the specific angular momentum they acquired by tidal torques .",
    "the results above are based on the assumption that the _ total _ specific angular momenta in the disks are the same as those in their halos [ equation  ( 4 ) ] .",
    "we may refer to this as the _ weak _ form of the assumption of angular - momentum conservation .",
    "in addition , it is sometimes supposed that the _ distributions _ of specific angular momentum in the disks are the same as those in their halos .",
    "this is usually expressed in terms of the fractions of mass with specific angular momentum below @xmath62 in the two components : @xmath63 we may refer to this as the _ strong _ form of the assumption of angular - momentum conservation .",
    "it is analogous to mestel s ( 1963 ) hypothesis that @xmath64 would be conserved in the collapse of a one - component protogalaxy ( made before dark halos were discovered ) .",
    "note that equation  ( 10 ) implies equation  ( 4 ) , but the converse is not true in general .",
    "it is possible to change @xmath65 in either component without affecting the corresponding @xmath66 .",
    "several authors have pointed out that the distribution @xmath67 for an exponential disk with a flat rotation curve is similar to that for a uniform sphere with a constant angular velocity ( gunn 1982 ; van der kruit 1987 ; dalcanton et al .",
    "this in turn resembles the distribution @xmath68 caused by tidal torques ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; quinn & zurek 1988 ) , although there has been a recent tendency to emphasize the differences rather than the similarities ( firmani & avila - reese 2000 ; bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; van den bosch 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the strong form of the assumption of angular - momentum conservation provides a possible explanation for the fact that the radial profiles of most galactic disks are approximately exponential .",
    "the main concern here is that several processes could alter @xmath67 and hence the radial profiles of the disks over their lifetimes .",
    "these include the torques exerted by non - axisymmetric features in the disks ( bars and spiral arms ) , the non - conservation of angular momentum as gas flows though shocks in spiral arms , and the exchange of angular momentum in collisions between clouds , not to mention galactic outflows , fountains , and mergers .",
    "it seems likely that these processes play some role in determining the present distributions of specific angular momentum in galactic disks .",
    "lin & pringle ( 1987 ) showed that the radial distributions of the stars in galactic disks would evolve toward exponential - like profiles if two conditions were met .",
    "( 1 ) the net effect of the processes that redistribute angular momentum in the interstellar gas can be described by an effective viscosity @xmath69 .",
    "( 2 ) the associated timescale , @xmath70 , is about the same as the timescale for star formation , @xmath71 .",
    "this is plausible because both the redistribution of angular momentum and the formation of stars may be regulated by instabilities in the disks , including bars and spiral arms , although we lack a full understanding of just how or even whether this would actually happen .",
    "the lin - pringle model has been explored further , including its chemical evolution , by several authors ( clarke 1989 ; yoshii & sommer - larsen 1989 ; sommer - larsen & yoshii 1989 , 1990 ) .",
    "this model raises the possibility that the ubiquitous exponential profile is the result of viscous processes operating in the disks after they formed rather than tidal torques acting on the galaxies while they formed .",
    "more likely , both are involved : the exponential profile is first established by external torques and is then reinforced by internal viscosity .",
    "about a decade ago , it became possible to simulate the hierarchical formation of galaxies with both dark matter and baryons by a combination of @xmath8-body and hydrodynamical models .",
    "the early simulations included the radiative cooling of the gas but not the formation of stars and the associated feedback ( heating and stirring of the gas ) .",
    "the results were very different from the analytical models described above ( navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ) . the baryonic objects that formed in these simulations were ellipsoidal in shape and an order of magnitude smaller than galactic disks of the same scaled mass .",
    "thus , they resembled the spheroids more than the disks of real galaxies .",
    "the reason for this is that the gas cooled quickly and collapsed into dense subunits within the halos .",
    "a combination of dynamical friction and gravitational torques within the halos then transferred most of the orbital angular momentum of the baryons to the dark matter , causing the subunits to sink toward the centers of the protogalaxies , where they then merged .",
    "( for a prescient discussion of how these processes might determine the different properties of galactic spheroids and disks , see zurek et al .  1988 . )",
    "the discrepancy between the baryonic objects produced in such simulations and real galactic disks has become known as the angular - momentum problem of galaxy formation .",
    "it is so severe that it is sometimes referred to as a crisis or catastrophe .",
    "steinmetz & navarro ( 1999 ) have explored this and related issues with a series of high - resolution simulations .",
    "they have tried to alleviate the angular - momentum problem by including some feedback in their simulations but find this makes little difference to the outcome .",
    "this conclusion , however , depends on their particular prescription for feedback .",
    "steinmetz & navarro assume that the gas is heated only in the immediate vicinity of ongoing star formation .",
    "then , since the gas is very dense at these locations , the energy input is quickly radiated away , before it can influence the motions or the thermodynamic state of the gas at other locations .",
    "steinmetz & navarro ( 1999 ) have also found that the zero - point of the relation between luminosity and circular velocity in their simulations differs significantly from that of the observed tully - fisher relation , especially in the einstein - de sitter cosmological model ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) with cdm .",
    "more recently , eke , navarro , & steinmetz ( 2001 ) have shown that this problem is reduced substantially or solved completely in the concordance cosmological model ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) with cdm or wdm .",
    "it is now widely believed that the solution of the angular - momentum problem must be found in some extreme form of feedback that prevents the baryons from collapsing until after the violent relaxation in their halos is complete .",
    "the baryons would then collapse within relatively smooth halos , with little quadrupole coupling , and hence would retain most of their specific angular momentum , as was originally , although perhaps naively , envisaged ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) .",
    "that this idea goes a long way toward solving the angular - momentum problem has been demonstrated explicitly in a number of recent simulations ( weil et al .",
    "1998 ; sommer - larsen , gelato , & vedel 1999 ; eke , efstathiou , & wright 2000 ; thacker & couchman 2001 ) . in the weil et al .  and",
    "eke et al .",
    "simulations , the gas evolves adiabatically until the redshift @xmath76 and is then allowed to cool radiatively and collapse . in the sommer - larsen et al .  and thacker & couchman simulations , the feedback is driven by local star formation but is extensive in both time and position ( in contrast to the steinmetz & navarro prescription ) .",
    "the common result of these studies is that the disks retain much more of their specific angular momentum .",
    "several other effects also help .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum is less severe in simulations with warm dark matter than in simulations with cold dark matter ( sommer - larsen & dolgov 2001 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the halos in wdm simulations have much less substructure and hence less dynamical friction and internal torques than the halos in cdm simulations .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum is also reduced in simulations with a cosmological constant ( eke et al .",
    "this happens because protogalaxies acquire their angular momenta earlier , before the gas cools , and then suffer fewer late mergers in the @xmath77-dominated simulations .",
    "it is also likely that some of the baryons in the inner parts of the protogalaxies , where the specific angular momentum is lowest , either formed the luminous spheroids or were expelled entirely in galactic winds ( eke et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the specific angular momenta of real galactic disks can be explained by a combination of extreme feedback and one or more of the other effects mentioned above .",
    "does this mean the angular - momentum problem has been solved ?",
    "yes and no .",
    "yes , because we now know that some mechanisms are capable of reconciling the simulations with observations .",
    "no , because we do not yet know whether these mechanisms operate in real galaxies .",
    "the issue of feedback is especially vexing because it probably depends on features of the interstellar medium on the scales of individual star - forming clouds , of order parsecs .",
    "( for a promising model of feedback , see efstathiou 2000 . ) the energy released by young stars  in ionizing radiation , stellar winds , and supernova ejecta  is more than sufficient to alter radically the collapse of the baryons in protogalaxies .",
    "the key issues are where , when , and how this energy is deposited , in particular , whether it is absorbed within the clouds themselves or is distributed more widely within the protogalaxies .",
    "this , in turn , depends on the sizes and masses of the clouds , the locations of the stars within them , whether the clouds are porous , and so forth .",
    "the goal of the research reviewed here has been to find a physically consistent model that accounts for the observed properties of galactic disks .",
    "two decades ago , it seemed as if we might be close to achieving this goal . at that time",
    ", the observed properties of galactic disks were explained remarkably well by an idealized model in which the baryons and dark matter in protogalaxies acquired the same specific angular momenta by tidal torques and then conserved them during and after the collapse of the baryons .",
    "a decade later we recognized that , if the gas in protogalaxies were to cool rapidly , most of the angular momentum of the baryons would be transferred to the dark matter .",
    "we now know that this angular - momentum problem can be solved by stellar feedback and other effects in principle , but we do not yet know how effective these processes are in practice . in another decade , with some luck , ngst will be in operation , and we should be able to observe the formation of galactic disks directly",
    ". it will be interesting to see how much theoretical and numerical progress has been made by then .",
    "the simulations will undoubtly improve , but it will be a formidable challenge to include all the relevant physics on all the relevant scales .",
