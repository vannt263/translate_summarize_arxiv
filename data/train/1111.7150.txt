    "the similarity resides in the fact that a parabolic - like map is a local concept , it is characterized by a filled julia set and an external map , and the external map of a degree @xmath2 parabolic - like mapping is a degree @xmath2 real - analytic orientation preserving self - covering of the unit circle .",
    "the difference resides in the fact that a parabolic - like map has a parabolic fixed point with an attracting petal outside the filled julia set , and the external map of a parabolic - like mapping has a parabolic fixed point .",

    "the map @xmath8 has a parabolic fixed point at @xmath9 .",
    "since the parabolic basin of attraction of the parabolic fixed point resides in the interior of the filled julia set , while the repelling direction resides on the julia set and outside of it , the external map of @xmath10 is hyperbolic .",

    "appropriate restrictions of the map @xmath14 belong to the class of parabolic - like mappings .    as polynomial - like mappings are straightened to polynomials , we straighten degree @xmath0 parabolic - like mappings to members of a model family of maps with a parabolic external class .",
    "we take as model family the family of quadratic rational maps with a parabolic fixed point of multiplier @xmath17 , normalized by fixing the parabolic fixed point to be infinity and the critical points to be @xmath17 and @xmath18 , this is @xmath19 \\,| \\ , p_a(z)=z+ 1/z+ a,\\,\\,a \\in \\c\\}.\\ ] ]    [ ca ]    [ m1 ]    all the maps in @xmath20 have a completely invariant fatou component @xmath21 , namely the parabolic basin of attraction of infinity .",
