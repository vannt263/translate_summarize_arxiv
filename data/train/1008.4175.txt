    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent a stage in the evolution of low- to intermediate - mass stars with initial masses of 1 - 8 @xmath3 . at the end of their life",
    ", a star of such mass evolves first into a red giant branch ( rgb ) star , then an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star , next a pn , and finally a white dwarf . during their evolution ,",
    "such stars eject a large amount of their mass .",
    "the investigation of chemical abundances in pne enables the determination of how much of a progenitor s mass becomes a pn , when and how elements synthesized in the progenitor were brought to the surface , and how chemically rich the galaxy was when the progenitors were born .",
    "currently , over 1,000 objects are regarded as pne in the galaxy ( acker et al .",
    "1991 ) . of these ,",
    "about 14 objects have been identified as halo members from their location and kinematics since the pn k 648 was discovered in m 15 ( pease 1928 ) .",
    "halo pne are interesting objects as they provide direct insight into the final evolution of old , low - mass halo stars , and they are able to convey important information for the study of low - mass star evolution and the early chemical conditions of the galaxy . however , in extremely metal - poor and c- and n - rich ( [ c , n / o]@xmath80 , [ ar / h]@xmath02 ) halo pne , there are unresolved issues on chemical abundances and evolution time scales .",
    "bobn 1 ( pn g108.476.1 ) is one of the c- and n - rich and extremely metal - poor halo pne ( [ c , n / o]@xmath91 , [ ar / h]=2.22@xmath50.09 , [ fe / h]=2.39@xmath50.14 ; this work ) , which composes a class of pn together with k 648 ( otsuka 2007 , see table 20 ) and h 4 - 1 ( otsuka et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the progenitors of halo pne are generally thought to be @xmath40.8 @xmath3 stars , which is the typical mass of a halo star .",
    "above mentioned three metal - poor c- and n - rich halo pne , however , show signatures that they have evolved from massive progenitors .",
    "for example , they would become n - rich , but would not c - rich if they have evolved from @xmath40.8 @xmath3 single stars with [ fe / h]@xmath42.3 ( @xmath10=10@xmath11 ) , according to the current stellar evolution models ( e.g. , fujimoto et al . 2000 ) . to become c - rich pne , the third dredge - up ( tdu ) must take place in the late agb phase .",
    "the efficiency of the tdu depends on the initial mass and composition , with increasing efficiency in models of increasing mass , or decreasing metallicity . at halo metallicities",
    ", it is predicted that the tdu is efficient in stars with initial masses greater than @xmath41 @xmath3 ( karakas 2010 ; stancliffe 2010 ) .",
    "also , current stellar evolutionary models predict that the post - agb evolution of a star with an initial mass @xmath40.8 @xmath3 proceeds too slowly for a visible pn to be formed .",
    "the origin and evolution of halo pne are still one of the unresolved big problems in this research field .",
    "how did these progenitor stars become visible c- and n - rich halo pne ? to answer this key question would deepen understanding of low - mass star evolution , in particular , extremely metal - poor c - rich stars found in the galactic halo , and galactic chemical evolution at early phases .",
    "if we can accurately estimate elemental abundances and ejected masses , then we can directly estimate elemental yields synthesized by pne progenitors which might provide a constraint to the growth - rate of core mass , the number of thermal pulses and dredge - up mass .",
    "hence we can build realistic stellar evolution models and galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "we have observed these extremely metal - poor c- and n - rich halo pne using the subaru / high - dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) and we also utilized collecting archival data carefully in order to revise our picture of these objects . in this paper , we focus on bobn 1 .    the known nebular and stellar parameters of bobn 1 are listed in table [ bb1.natures ] .",
    "zijlstra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have associated bobn 1 with the leading tail of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal galaxy , which traces several halo globular clusters . the heliocentric distance to the sgr dwarf galaxy",
    "is @xmath424.8 kpc ( kunder & chaboyer 2009 ) , while the distance to this object is between 16.5 ( henry et al .",
    "2004 ) and 29 kpc ( kingsburgh & barlow 1992 ) .",
    "bobn 1 is a unique pn in that it might possess information about the chemical building - up history of the galactic halo .",
    "otsuka et al . ( 2008a ) found that the [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] abundances of bobn 1 are compatible with those of carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars .",
    "the c and n overabundances of cemp can be explained by theoretical binary interaction models ( e.g. , komiya et al .",
    "2007 ; lau et al . 2007 ) .",
    "otsuka et al . ( 2008a ) detected two fluorine ( f ) lines and found that bobn 1 is the most f - enhanced and metal - poor pn among f - detected pne .",
    "they found that the c , n , and f overabundances of bobn1 are comparable to those of the cemp star he1305 + 0132 ( schuler et al .",
    "2007 ) . through a comparison between the observed enhancements of c , n , and f with the theoretical binary nucleosynthesis model by lugaro et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , they concluded that bobn 1 might share its origin and evolution with cemp-_s _ stars such as he1305 + 0132 , and if that is the case the slow neutron capture process ( the _ s_-process ) should be considered .    according to current evolutionary models of low- to intermediate - mass stars ,",
    "the _ s_-process elements are synthesized by slowly capturing neutrons during the thermal pulse agb phase .",
    "the _ s_-process elements together with carbon are brought to the stellar surface by the tdu .",
    "if we could find signatures that bobn 1 has experienced binary evolutions such as mass transfer from a massive companion and coalescence , the issues on chemical abundances and evolutionary time scale would be simultaneously resolved .",
    "it would also be of great significance to reveal the origin of these elements in the early galaxy through the study of metal - poor objects such as bobn 1",
    ". we will search _",
    "s_-process elements and investigate their enhancement in bobn 1 .    in this paper",

    "we detect several candidate collisional excited lines ( cels ) of _ s_-process elements and optical recombination lines ( orls ) of n , o , and ne . we determine ionic and chemical abundances of 13 elements using orls and cels . we construct a detailed photo - ionization model to derive the properties of the central star , ionized nebula , and dust",
