    "rydberg atoms are enriched with enhanced two - body interactions . when atoms in a dense frozen ensemble are excited to the rydberg state using narrow band lasers , strong rydberg - rydberg interactions lead to excitation blockade .",
    "this blockade interaction generates a highly entangled many - body quantum state in an ensemble of atoms which has become the basis for fundamental quantum gates using atoms  @xcite or photons  @xcite and for realization of single photon source  @xcite .",
    "rydberg blockade in ultra - cold atoms and bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) has been proposed to study strongly correlated systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , strong photon - photon interactions enabled by rydberg blockade mediated optical non - linearity has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "rydberg blockade has been demonstrated for an ensemble of ultra - cold atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot )  @xcite or in a magnetic trap  @xcite and also for single atoms trapped in optical micro traps  @xcite .",
    "recently , strong optical non - linearity mediated by rydberg blockade in cold atom has been observed for weak classical light  @xcite as well as for single photons  @xcite and also in a cold atomic sample inside an optical cavity  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the blockade radius for an ultra - cold atomic sample is defined as @xmath4{\\frac{c_6}{\\hbar\\omega_{eff}}}$ ] , where @xmath5 is the effective rabi frequency of the rydberg excitation and @xmath6 is the strength of the van der waals type rydberg - rydberg interaction . for a thermal ensemble of atoms ,",
    "the blockade radius is affected by the doppler width ( @xmath7 ) due to the thermal motion of atoms .",
    "since the van der waals interaction scales as the sixth power of the inter - atomic separation , the blockade radius is scaled down as @xmath8{\\delta\\nu_d}$ ]  @xcite . for thermal rubidium atoms at room temperature ,",
    "the blockade radius is decreased only by a factor in the range of @xmath0 @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "if one works with a rydberg state , @xmath11 , the blockade radius in thermal vapor is of the order of a few microns .",

    "the schematic of the experimental set up is shown in figure 1(a ) . a technique based on optical heterodyne",
    "is used to measure the dispersion of a probe beam due to two - photon excitation to the rydberg state . a similar method used for dispersion measurement in atomic vapors",
    "is reported in references  @xcite .",
    "an external cavity diode laser operating at @xmath12 nm is used to derive two probe beams .",
    "a frequency offset is introduced between the probe beams by passing them through two acousto - optic modulators .",
    "both the beams are made to superpose using a polarizing cube beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the interference beat signals are detected using two fast photo - detectors by introducing polarizers at both the output ports of the pbs .",
    "the probe beams coming out of one of the output ports of the pbs propagate through a magnetically shielded rubidium vapor cell .",
    "the density of @xmath13rb vapor can be increased to @xmath14 @xmath15 by heating the cell up to @xmath16c .",
    "the coupling beam is derived from a frequency doubled diode laser operating at @xmath17 nm and it counter - propagates the probe beams through the cell . the coupling and",
    "the probe beams are focused inside the cell using lenses .",
    "the waist and the rayleigh range of the probe ( coupling ) beams are @xmath18 @xmath3 m ( @xmath19 @xmath3 m ) and @xmath20 mm ( @xmath21 mm ) , respectively . the peak rabi frequencies of the laser beams and their variations over the length of the vapor cell were calculated  @xcite using the same parameters of the beams and were included in the theoretical model to fit all the experimental data .    the probe beams propagating through the medium can undergo different phase shifts by choosing suitable polarizations of the probe and the coupling beams .",
    "the polarization of the coupling beam is chosen to be @xmath22 and the probe beams to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 as shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "the probe beam with @xmath22 polarization can not couple the two - photon transition , @xmath24s@xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27s@xmath25 and does nt go through any phase shift due to two - photon process .",
    "we use it as the reference probe beam .",
    "however , the other probe beam with @xmath23 polarization can couple the same two - photon transition and hence , goes through a phase shift due to two - photon excitation to the rydberg state .",
    "this additional phase shift of the signal probe beam appears as a phase shift in the respective beat signal and is measured by comparing to the phase of the reference beat signal detected at the other output port of the pbs .",
    "since , both the beat signals are the output of the same interferometer , the noise due to vibration and acoustic disturbances are strongly suppressed . the signal - to - noise ratio was further improved by using a lock - in amplifier .",

    "depend on the power of the probe beams falling on the detector .",
    "the beat signals are then multiplied using an electronic waveform mixer and are passed through a low pass filter .",

    "for any small variation of the phase around @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 gives information about absorption ( dispersion ) of the probe beam propagating through the medium .",
    "a phase offset between the beams falling on the reference detector was introduced by placing a @xmath40-plate before the polarizer . as a result",
    ", the phase of the reference beat can be controlled by rotating the polarizer axis .",
    "the refractive index of the @xmath41 probe beam due to two - photon excitation to the rydberg state can be measured with a phase offset , @xmath38 .",
    "the detailed principle of the technique can be found in reference  @xcite . for a larger frequency offset between",
    "the probe beams in comparison to their rabi frequency , the experimental result matches well with the standard model of a 3-level atom interacting with a single probe and coupling beams  @xcite .",
    "hence , a large frequency offset of @xmath42 mhz is used in the experiment .    in the experiment ,",
    "the probe beam was stabilized at @xmath43 ghz blue detuned to the d2 line of @xmath13rb .",
    "the coupling laser frequency was scanned to observe the dispersion of the probe beam by measuring its phase shift due to the two - photon excitations to the rydberg state .",

    "are used as probe and coupling rabi frequencies respectively .",

    ", @xmath49 is the hamiltonian for a three - level atom interacting with two mono - chromatic light field in a suitable rotating frame and @xmath50 is the lindblad operator which takes care of the decoherence in the system . in the numerical calculation , we have used the decay rate of the channels @xmath51 as @xmath52 mhz .",
    "a population decay rate of the rydberg state to the ground state denoted as @xmath53 is used to account for the finite transit time of the thermal atoms in the laser beams .",

    "to get an insight to such unusual dispersion profile , we approximated the 3-level atom as an effective 2-level atom by adiabatically eliminating the intermediate state  @xcite . using the same approximation ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) in the steady state equations of 3-level atom",
    ", the susceptibility of the medium can be written as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the susceptibility of the lower transition without coupling beam and @xmath62 is the susceptibility due to 2-photon resonance only .",

    "in the regime @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 . the rydberg population ( @xmath70 ) can be determined analytically using the effective 2-level model .",
    "doppler averaging of the equation ( 1 ) with same laser parameters fits well with the experimental data as shown in figure 2 .",
    "this approximate model shows a very little deviation from the exact 3-level calculation for the probe rabi frequency up to @xmath71 mhz .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that @xmath72 .",
    "comparing it with @xmath73 , the dispersion peak is an order of magnitude larger than the absorption peak for @xmath74 ghz and @xmath75 mhz .",
    "[ fig3 ]    in a further study of variation of the dispersion peak height as a function of probe rabi frequency , an rf attenuator at the output of the detectors was used to keep the amplitude of the beat constant irrespective of the probe laser power .",
    "the variation of the dispersion peak height as a function of probe rabi frequency for different vapor densities is shown in figure 3(a ) .",
    "the dispersion peak height calculated by the theoretical model for the same laser parameters and vapor densities agrees well as shown in figure 3(a ) .",
    "when the dispersion peak height data is normalized to that of a weak probe beam , then all the data corresponding to different densities fall on the same line as shown in figure 3(b ) .",
    "this observation suggests that the refractive index of the medium depends linearly on the vapor density and the rydberg - rydberg interaction has negligible effect .",
    "[ fig4 ]    to study the blockade interaction , the blue laser was tuned to interact with a rydberg state with principal quantum number @xmath1 and the same experiment was performed .",
    "the variation of the dispersion peak height at different densities in the strong rydberg - rydberg interaction regime is shown in figure 4(a ) .",
    "in contrast to the observation presented in figure 3 , the normalized dispersion peak height shows a non - linear dependence of density and there is a clear indication of suppression of the dispersion peak at higher densities . since @xmath76 ,",
    "then suppression in dispersion peak height is due to the suppression of rydberg population which is the signature of the rydberg blockade interaction .",
    "the ions inside the vapor cell has negligible effect which was confirmed using rydberg eit  @xcite for @xmath77s@xmath25 rydberg state .",
    "the blackbody radiation induced ionization and transition rates are less than @xmath21 khz  @xcite and has negligible effect . to exclude the possibility of suppression in the dispersion peak due to interaction induced dephasing",
    ", we introduced a rydberg population dependent dephasing of the dipole matrix element @xmath54 similar to the model discussed in reference  @xcite .",
    "rydberg population ( @xmath70 ) decays at a rate of @xmath53 and @xmath54 decays at a rate of @xmath78 . introducing this term in the effective 2-level model , a cubic equation of @xmath70 is obtained .",
    "looking at the coefficients of the cubic equation , one can deduce that out of the 3 solutions of @xmath70 , one is positive real and the other two solutions are either negative real or complex conjugate to each other .",
    "the positive solution of @xmath70 is evaluated by solving the cubic equation numerically and is replaced in equation ( 1 ) to calculate the dispersion of the probe beam . the dispersion peak height calculated using this model",
    "is shown in figure 4(b ) .",
    "we have observed that depending on @xmath79 , the dispersion peak height reduces in comparison with the non - interacting model , but monotonically increases as the probe rabi frequency and does nt display any feature of saturation . also , by increasing @xmath79 from @xmath71 mhz to @xmath80 ghz , a very small reduction of the dispersion peak is observed .    to explain the saturation of the experimental data , we introduced blockade classically . consider the number of atoms per blockade sphere to be @xmath81 nad blockade radius to be @xmath82 .",
    "the probability of simultaneous multiple excitations of @xmath27 out of @xmath81 atoms to the rydberg state is given by @xmath83 .",
    "for these events , only one rydberg excitation out of @xmath27 atoms is considered and the blockaded rydberg population is evaluated as @xmath84 . the dispersion of the probe is then determined by replacing @xmath85 in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the theoretical curves generated after introducing blockade into the model are shown in figure 4 .",
    "if we take @xmath86 @xmath3 m , then it fits well with the experimental data for all three densities . as shown in figure 4(b ) , if the blockade radius is changed by @xmath87 , it clearly does nt fit to the experimental data .",
    "the width of the dispersion spectra for different probe rabi frequencies are shown in figure 4(c , d and e ) . for @xmath88 mhz , the rydberg population is small and in this non - interacting regime , the model with blockade and population dependent dephasing shows very little deviation from the non - interacting model . for @xmath89 mhz ,",
    "the model with population dependent dephasing reduces significantly from the non - interacting model but further including blockade does nt show much deviation . for @xmath90 mhz",
    ", there is a significant suppression of the peak due to blockade .",
    "however , the width of the dispersion spectrum does nt change appreciably compared to the non - interacting model as shown in figure 4(e ) which indicates a clear evidence of rydberg blockade in our system .    in conclusion",
    ", rydberg blockade is demonstrated in thermal vapor and the blockade radius is measured to be @xmath2 @xmath3 m .",
    "the van der waals coefficient ( @xmath6 ) for the rydberg state ( @xmath77s@xmath25 ) is @xmath91 ghz/@xmath3m@xmath92  @xcite .",
    "the typical width of the 2-photon resonance is about @xmath71 mhz which can be determined from figure 1(c ) .",
    "hence , blockade radius in this system should be approximately @xmath93 @xmath3 m which differ from our experimental result by less than @xmath94 .",
    "it is to be noted that we have introduced blockade classically and a full quantum mechanical model may give a better estimate for the blockade radius .",
    "our result shows that the coherent collective rydberg excitation is possible in thermal vapor and opens up the possibility to build the quantum devices like single photon source and photonic phase gate based on rydberg blockade non - linearity in thermal vapor .",
