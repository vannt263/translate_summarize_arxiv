    "the unification of general relativity with the laws of quantum mechanics is one of the oldest wishes of theoretical physicists from the birth of quantum mechanics .",
    "we can mention the canonical quantization @xcite and the path integral quantization of gravity @xcite as two well - known but old proposals which tried to present a quantization scheme for gravity .",
    "however , from the field theoretical viewpoint , the theory of relativity is not renormalizable and leads to ultraviolet divergencies .",
    "moreover , around the planck energy scale , the effects of gravity are so important that they would result in discreteness of the spacetime manifold .",
    "this argument is based on the fact that , when we try to probe small distances with high energies , it will significantly disturb the spacetime structure by the gravitational effects . however , the theory can be renormalizable by introducing a minimal observable length as an effective cutoff in the ultraviolet domain .",
    "the existence of a minimum measurable length is one of the common aspects of various candidates of quantum gravity such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , and quantum geometry . within a string - theoretical argument",
    ", we can say that a string can not probe distances smaller than its length . moreover , some gedanken experiments in black - hole physics and noncommutativity of the spacetime manifold all agree on the existence of a minimal observable distance of the order of the planck length @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is newton s constant @xcite .",
    "in fact , the finite resolution of spacetime points is a consequence of finite time measurement . in principle",
    ", one can probe very short distances in @xmath8-branes but in an infinite time .",
    "note that , this is in obvious contradiction with the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) which puts no lower or upper bound on the nonsimultaneous measurement of the position or the momentum of a particle .",
    "in fact , in ordinary quantum mechanics @xmath9 can be made arbitrarily small by letting @xmath10 to grow correspondingly .",
    "however , for energies close to the planck energy , the particle s schwarzschild radius and its compton wavelength become approximately in the order of the planck length .",
    "so , in order to merge the idea of the minimal length into quantum mechanics , we need to modify the ordinary uncertainty principle to the so - called generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) . indeed , the notion of minimal length should quantum mechanically be described as a minimal uncertainty in position measurements .",
    "the introduction of this idea has drawn much attention in recent years and many papers have been appeared in the literature to address the effects of gup on various quantum mechanical systems and phenomena @xcite .    in this paper , we present a nonperturbative approach to one - dimensional gravitational quantum mechanics which implies a minimal length uncertainty so that the generalized position operator does not change to all orders , that is , @xmath0 and the generalized momentum operator is given by @xmath11 to first order of the gup parameter . in this formalism the generalized position and momentum operators satisfy @xmath12=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^{2})$ ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the ordinary position and momentum operators @xmath5=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "we show that this proposal is equivalent with kempf , mangano , and mann ( kmm ) representation , but it only modifies the kinetic part of the hamiltonian and has no effect on the potential part .",
    "moreover , this representation agrees with perturbative approaches and predicts the presence of a maximal canonical momentum @xmath15 . here",
    ", we consider the problems of the free particle and the harmonic oscillator in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle and obtain the exact eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "then , we discuss the consequences of the minimal uncertainty in position measurement on the partition function , mean energy , and heat capacity of these systems . the difficulties with potentials with infinitely sharp boundaries are also presented .",
    "according to the heisenberg uncertainty relation , in principle , we can separately measure the position and momentum of particles with arbitrary precision . thus ,",
    "if there is a genuine lower bound on the results of the measurements , the heisenberg uncertainty relation should be modified .",
    "here we consider a generalized uncertainty principle which results in a minimum observable length @xmath16 where @xmath2 is the gup parameter and @xmath17 is a positive constant that depends on the expectation value of the momentum operator .",
    "we also have @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the planck mass and @xmath20 is of the order of one .",
    "note that the deviation from the heisenberg picture takes place in the high energy limit where the quantum gravity effects are dominant .",
    "so , for the energies much smaller than the planck energy @xmath21 gev , we should recover the famous heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the above inequality relation ( [ gup ] ) implies the existence of an absolute minimal length uncertainty as @xmath22 . in the context of string theory",
    ", we can interpret this length as the string length .",
    "accordingly , the string s length is proportional to the square root of the gup parameter . in one - dimension",
    ", the above uncertainty relation can be obtained from a deformed commutation relation , namely @xmath23=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for @xmath24 we recover the well - known commutation relation in ordinary quantum mechanics . now using eqs .",
    "( [ gup ] ) and ( [ gupc ] ) we can find the relation between @xmath17 and the expectation value of the momentum operator i.e. @xmath25 . as kempf , mangano , and mann have suggested in their seminal paper , in momentum space representation , we can write @xmath3 and @xmath4 as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are symmetric operators on the dense domain @xmath27 with respect to the following scalar product @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this representation",
    "the position operator is merely symmetric , but @xmath4 is self - adjoint @xcite . with this definition , the commutation relation ( [ gupc ] ) is exactly satisfied . also ,",
    "in quasiposition representation this formulation results in @xcite @xmath31 note that , for the general potential , expressing the position operator as a combination of ordinary position and momentum operators results in a complicated high - order generalized schrdinger equation .",
    "so , finding the solutions even for the simple potentials would not be an easy task .    to overcome this problem , we propose the following generalized position and momentum operators @xmath32 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 obey the canonical commutation relation @xmath5=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are symmetric operators on the dense domain @xmath27 of functions decaying faster than any power @xmath33 but now with respect to the scalar product : @xmath34 the symmetry of @xmath4 ( [ x0p02 ] ) is obvious .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath3 ( [ x0p01 ] ) can be seen by performing partial integrations @xmath35 which is valid for the functions vanishing at @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , the symmetry property of the position and momentum operators ensures that all expectation values are real .",
    "this definition exactly satisfies the condition @xmath12=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^2)$ ] and agrees with the well - known relations @xcite , namely @xmath37 to the first order of the gup parameter . note that to @xmath38 , the definitions ( [ k3 ] ) and ( [ k4 ] ) result in @xmath39 and @xmath40 which differ with ( [ xp - old1 ] ) and ( [ xp - old2 ] ) .",
    "now , we show that our proposal and kmm representation are equivalent in essence .",
    "indeed , they are related by the following canonical transformation : @xmath41x,\\\\ p&\\rightarrow&\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\beta}p\\right)/\\sqrt{\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which transforms ( [ x0p01 ] ) and ( [ x0p02 ] ) into ( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) subjected to condition ( [ gupc ] ) .",
    "we can interpret @xmath4 and @xmath14 as follows : @xmath14 is the momentum operator at low energies ( @xmath42 ) while @xmath4 is the momentum operator at high energies .",
    "obviously , this procedure affects all hamiltonians in adopted quantum mechanics .",
    "note that for an operator @xmath43 which is `` formally '' self - adjoint ( @xmath44 ) such as ( [ x0p01 ] ) and ( [ x0p02 ] ) , this does not prove that @xmath43 is truly self - adjoint because in general the domains @xmath45 and @xmath46 may be different . the operator @xmath43 with dense domain @xmath45 is said to be self - adjoint if @xmath47 and @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , similar to kmm representation , @xmath3 is merely symmetric but not self - adjoint . to see this note that in this representation and in the momentum space the wave function @xmath48 have to vanish at the end of the @xmath14 interval @xmath49 , because the tangent function diverges there .",
    "so , @xmath3 is a derivative operator @xmath50 on an interval with dirichlet boundary conditions . but",
    "this means that @xmath3 can not be self - adjoint because all candidates for the eigenfunctions of @xmath3 , ( the plane waves , which are even normalizable ) are not in the domain of @xmath3 because they do not obey dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "calculating the domain of the adjoint of @xmath3 shows that it is larger than that of @xmath3 , so @xmath3 is indeed not self - adjoint i.e. @xmath51 now since @xmath48 vanishes at @xmath52 , @xmath53 can take any arbitrary value at the boundaries .",
    "the above equation implies that @xmath3 is symmetric , but it is not a self - adjoint operator . although its adjoint @xmath54 has the same formal expression , it acts on a different space of functions , namely @xmath55 as it is also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , any operator @xmath3 which obeys the uncertainty relation ( [ gup ] ) is merely symmetric . on the other hand , since there are no dirichlet boundary conditions on the wave functions in the position space ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath4 is still self - adjoint . in the next section and after finding the momentum eigenfunctions , we prove the self - adjointness property of @xmath4 using von neumann s theorem .    to proceed further , let us consider the following hamiltonian @xmath57 which using eqs .",
    "( [ x0p01 ] ) and ( [ x0p02 ] ) can be written exactly and also perturbatively as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the @xmath61th bernoulli number .",
    "so the corrected terms in the modified hamiltonian are only momentum dependent and proportional to @xmath62 for @xmath63 . as we shall explicitly show , the presence of these terms leads to a positive shift in the particle s energy spectrum .",
    "note that , in general , even for the self - adjoint position and momentum operators , it is by no means obvious that the resulting hamiltonian will be self - adjoint until and unless the potential term is specified and the appropriate domain is chosen .",
    "it is worth to mention that all our calculations are in one - dimensional space .",
    "indeed , in higher dimensions it is necessary to have noncommutativity of coordinates in order to satisfy the jacobi identity as done by kmm @xcite . in one - dimensional space ,",
    "the jacobi identity is automatically satisfied .",
    "also , one may relax the point size property of the particle as in the string theory .",
    "so we can interpret eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) as the schrdinger equation for the particle with size @xmath64 , where the effect of the nonzero size effectively appears in the kinetic part of the hamiltonian .    in the quantum domain ,",
    "this hamiltonian results in the following generalized schrdinger equation in the quasiposition representation : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and the second term is due to the gup corrected terms in ( [ h ] ) .",
    "among infinite possible canonical transformations ( cts ) , our proposal ( [ x0p01 ] ) and ( [ x0p02 ] ) has some useful and novel properties .",
    "first , it does not change the nature of the position operator and , consequently , the potential term and only modifies the momentum or the kinetic operator .",
    "so , among several cts , only this one preserves the ordinary nature of the position operator .",
    "second , this formalism lets us to write the hamiltonian as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the ordinary hamiltonian and @xmath69 contain only the momentum operator .",
    "so , using the perturbation theory , the unperturbed eigenfunctions satisfy @xmath70 and we can find @xmath71 in an straightforward manner as done for various cases such as ref .  @xcite . in other cts like the kmm proposal , we can not decompose the hamiltonian in such configurations .",
    "so , in this sense , this proposal is compatible with perturbative representations .",
    "third , this proposal predicts the existence of a maximal canonical momentum .",
    "in fact , the particular form of the kinetic part of the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) implies the existence of a maximal momentum : @xmath72 which mimics the recent gup proposal predicting the presence of both a minimal length uncertainty and a maximal momentum uncertainty through a doubly special relativity consideration @xcite .",
    "there , the generalized momentum has an upper bound proportional to @xmath73 where @xmath74 similar to @xmath20 is of the order of unity .",
    "however , for our case , the generalized momentum @xmath4 has no upper bound and it is not physically equivalent with aforementioned gup .",
    "therefore , the idea of a maximum `` canonical '' momentum naturally arises from our representation .",
    "in ordinary quantum mechanics , the free particle wave function @xmath75 is defined as the eigenfunction of the momentum operator @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath14 is the eigenvalue . the momentum operator has the following representation in the quasiposition space @xmath78 so , from eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) we have @xmath79 which has the following solution @xmath80 where the constant of integration is chosen to satisfy @xmath81 in gup scenario , to find the momentum eigenfunction in the position space , we write the momentum operator ( [ x0p02 ] ) as @xmath82 which results in the following eigenvalue equation @xmath83 now , let us consider a class of solutions which satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) at the same time , but with different eigenvalues [ @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) ] , i.e. , @xmath85 where @xmath86 . inserting this solution in eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) results in @xmath87 or @xmath88 so we have @xmath89.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain @xmath90 , we demand that the momentum eigenfunction satisfies eq .",
    "( 23 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite as the modified version of ( [ norm ] ) which results in @xmath91^{-1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we finally obtain the momentum eigenfunctions as @xmath92,\\hspace{.6cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , to the first order agrees with the solution presented in ref .",
    "@xcite i.e. @xmath93.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this solution for @xmath94 reduces to ( [ solp ] ) in order to satisfy the correspondence principle .",
    "moreover , this result is similar to the position eigenvectors obtained by kmm , where they used ( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) subjected to the deformed scalar product ( [ scalar ] ) . in fact , the factor @xmath95 in the definition of the scalar product ( [ scalar ] ) indeed appeared in the momentum - dependent normalization coefficient of the momentum eigenfunctions , namely , @xmath96 for an operator @xmath43 with deficiency indices @xmath97 there are three possibilities :    \\1 .",
    "if @xmath98 , then @xmath43 is self - adjoint ( this is a necessary and sufficient condition ) .",
    "\\2 . if @xmath99 , then @xmath43 has infinitely many self - adjoint extensions , parameterized by a unitary @xmath100 matrix .",
    "\\3 . if @xmath101 , then @xmath43 has no self - adjoint extension .    to use von neumann s theorem",
    ", we have to find the wave functions @xmath102 given by @xmath103 so using eq .",
    "( [ sai ] ) we have @xmath104.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the operator @xmath4 is defined on the whole real axis where @xmath102 diverge at @xmath105 and consequently are not normalizable , none of the functions @xmath102 belong to the hilbert space @xmath106 and therefore the deficiency indices are @xmath107 . hence , we conclude that the momentum operator is indeed self - adjoint with the following domain @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the maximal domain on which the operator @xmath4 has a well defined action , i.e. , @xmath110 . using the same procedure for the position operator @xmath3 on the finite interval , it is straightforward to check that both @xmath111 belong to @xmath112 and the deficiency indices are @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , one concludes that the position operator is no longer essentially self - adjoint but has a one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions which is in agreement with the previous result .",
    "in this section , we study the classical and quantum mechanical solutions of the harmonic oscillator in the gup framework and present its semiclassical results . moreover , we study the effects of the minimal length uncertainty on the thermodynamic aspects of the harmonic oscillator in both classical and quantum domains .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of a particle of mass @xmath114 confined in a quadratic potential @xmath115 which using the hamiltonian equations results in @xmath116 so , in the gup formalism , the velocity @xmath117 is not equal to @xmath118 , but it tends to @xmath118 as @xmath2 goes to zero . using eqs .",
    "( [ ho1 ] ) and ( [ ho2 ] ) we obtain @xmath119 if we set the initial conditions as @xmath120 and @xmath121 , it is straightforward to check that the above equation admits the following solutions @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "so the actual frequency of the harmonic oscillator in gup scenario increases with respect to the absence of gup as @xmath124 .",
    "in fact , this frequency depends on gup parameter , particle s mass , and the initial position .",
    "moreover , as @xmath2 increases , the particle is often located at the end points @xmath125 and the accessible phase space decreases with respect to the absence of gup ( see fig .  [ figx ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      before studying the corresponding generalized schrdinger equation , it is worthwhile to find the quantized energy spectrum using the semiclassical scheme .",
    "the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) quantization rule , represented succinctly by the formula @xmath126 allows us to find the approximate energy spectrum and in ordinary quantum mechanics gives the exact results . using eq .",
    "( [ hsho ] ) we find @xmath127 which results in the following semiclassical energy spectrum @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "as we have expected , @xmath130 tends to @xmath131 as @xmath2 goes to zero .",
    "however , contrary to the ordinary formulation where @xmath130 is equal to the exact energy spectrum , it does not give the exact spectrum in the gup formalism .",
    "this is due to the fact that from the hamiltonian ( [ hsho ] ) we expect that the energy spectrum depends on numerous powers of @xmath2 , but @xmath130 only represents a linear dependence of the gup parameter . in the next section ,",
    "we show this fact by a rigorous mathematical proof .",
    "however , it can be considered as a good approximation which is related to the correct quadratic dependence on the quantum number .      for the case of the harmonic oscillator , because of the quadratic form of the potential @xmath132 , we obtain a second - order differential equation in the momentum space , namely @xmath133 where @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 . in terms of the new variable @xmath137 , we obtain @xmath138\\phi(z;\\nu)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where by definition @xmath139 and the boundary condition is @xmath140 the above differential equation is exactly solvable and the eigenfunctions can be obtained in terms of gauss hypergeometric functions where we briefly present the solutions @xcite .    to find the even parity states ,",

    "now , to get rid of the regular singularity of the last term we search for the solution of the form @xmath144 where @xmath145 satisfy the algebraic equation @xmath146 so we obtain the gauss hypergeometric equation for the variable @xmath147 @xmath148 subjected to @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "this equation admits two independent solutions .",

    "[ figebar ] , in the presence of gup , the mean energy decreases with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "the reason for the reduction of mean energy with respect to @xmath24 is a consequence of the reduction of phase space volume ( surface ) due to possible definition of a rescaled @xmath203 .",
    "in fact the volume of the fundamental cell increases in the presence of the minimal length uncertainty relation and the number of degrees of freedom reduces consequently .",
    "moreover , it modifies the helmholtz free energy @xmath204 and the entropy @xmath205 as well .",

    ", we study the problem of a particle in a box as an example of a potential with infinitely sharp boundaries and compare both energy corrections .",
    "so , let us consider a particle with mass @xmath114 confined in an infinite one - dimensional box with length @xmath229 @xmath230 the corresponding eigenfunctions should satisfy the following generalized schrdinger equation @xmath231 for @xmath232 and they also meet the boundary conditions @xmath233 .",
    "because of the boundary conditions , the eigenfunctions do not change with respect to the absence of the gup ( @xmath24 ) @xcite .",
    "this fact leads us to consider the following additional condition for the eigenfunctions @xmath234 where @xmath235 . if this condition is also satisfied , we can write the second term in eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) in terms of @xmath236 i.e. @xmath237 so , we have @xmath238 now , comparing eqs .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ h4 ] ) shows that @xmath239.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this gup corrected energy spectrum can be also obtained using the wilson - sommerfeld quantization rule given by @xmath240 with two conjugate variables @xmath14 and @xmath241 and the integer @xmath61 . since the potential is constant ( zero ) inside the box ,",
    "we have @xmath242 so the semiclassical spectrum is @xmath243 which exactly coincides with the quantum mechanical spectrum given by eq .",
    "( [ ebox ] ) .",
    "these results show that the gup energy correction is of order of @xmath244 .",
    "now let us find the energy correction due to the uncertainty in the position of the well s walls @xmath245 which is first order in @xmath246 .",
    "therefore , the gup energy correction is much smaller than @xmath247 and can not be detected in the presence of the minimal length .",
    "this result confirms that the particle in a box potential can not be defined in the gup framework as in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "this conclusion can be also generalized to other potentials with infinitely sharp boundaries .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a nonperturbative gravitational quantum mechanics in agreement with the existence of a minimal length uncertainty relation . in this formalism",
    "the generalized hamiltonian takes the form @xmath248 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the ordinary position and momentum operators .",
    "we showed that this approach is equivalent with kmm representation and we found the corresponding canonical transformation .",
    "this representation has some advantages : first , it modifies only the kinetic part ( momentum operator ) and the potential term ( position operator ) remains unchanged .",
    "second , this formalism is compatible with perturbative schemes .",
    "third , this representation predicts the existence of a maximal canonical momentum proportional to @xmath249 .",
    "because of the universality of the gup effects , this formalism can potentially be tested in various quantum mechanical systems , of which we have studied just a few cases .",
    "we thoroughly studied the case of the harmonic oscillator in classical and quantum domains . in the classical domain",
    ", we found the trajectory of the oscillating particle and showed that the gup modified frequency of the oscillator depends on mass , initial position and the gup parameter .",
    "also , for large @xmath2 the particle is often located around the end points . in the quantum domain",
    ", we obtained the exact energy eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions and showed that they are in agreement with those obtained in ref .",
    "moreover , the quadratic dependence of the energy spectrum on the state number is confirmed using the semiclassical approximation . to address the effects of the generalized uncertainty principle on the thermodynamic properties of the harmonic oscillator",
    ", we found the partition functions and the mean energies in both classical and quantum limits .",
    "we showed that , in the presence of the gup and at the fixed temperature , the mean energy and the heat capacity of the oscillator reduce in comparison with those of the ordinary classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "also , we have indicated that @xmath3 and @xmath181 are merely symmetric , but @xmath4 is a truly self - adjoint operator .",
    "note that these results for @xmath3 and @xmath4 agree with those of kmm representation @xcite .",
    "however , the difference is that in this representation all these operators are formally self - adjoint , i.e. , @xmath44 ( @xmath250 ) , but @xmath251 for @xmath252 and @xmath253 . on the other hand , in kmm representation",
    "only @xmath4 is formally and truly self - adjoint .",
    "the problems with the potentials with sharp boundaries are finally discussed .",
    "we showed that for this type of potentials , the gup energy correction is much smaller than the uncertainty in the energy spectrum due to the boundaries position uncertainty .",
