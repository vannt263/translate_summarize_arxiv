    "the study of the problem of motion in general relativity ( gr ) has been a central theme in testing its validity .",
    "for instance , the post - newtonian program , computing gr corrections to the newtonian gravitational potential between massive bodies , is crucial to understanding gravity in our solar system . in",
    "the past decade or more , the post - newtonian analysis of weak field gravity has also been developed to very high order in perturbation theory because of the need to model gravitational waves ( gws ) from inspiraling compact binaries , which is expected to be a major source for detectors like advanced ligo . at the same time",
    ", the discovery of cosmic acceleration and its associated cosmological constant problem , has prompted many attempts to modify how gravity operates at large ( astrophysical ) length scales .",
    "one such example is the family of scalar field theories known as galileons  @xcite , building on interesting properties of a limit of the dvali - gabadadze - porrati model  @xcite .",
    "these scalar fields couple to the stress - energy of ordinary matter , and therefore alter large scale dynamics , but due to their self interactions they exhibit the vainshtein screening effect  @xcite , such that masses close to the central source of gravity ( lying within a so - called vainshtein radius @xmath0 ) do not feel their presence , and thus allowing galileons to evade solar system tests of gr to date .",
    "furthermore , models of this type have become even more interesting since it has been discovered that they may be extended in multiple ways to yield other new field theories  @xcite with related attractive properties , and that they arise as a limit of ghost - free massive gravity  @xcite    in this paper , we wish to lay the groundwork for understanding analytically , and in some detail , the impact of such vainshtein screened scalar fields on the problem of motion . to achieve concrete results we will consider the cubic galileon theory about flat spacetime and couple the galileon field to the trace of the stress - energy of matter .",
    "we will place a large mass @xmath8 at the origin of our coordinate system .",
    "the central goal of this paper is to solve the retarded green s function of the linearized equations of motion of the galileon fluctuating around the background field sourced by @xmath8 . in a paper in preparation  @xcite",
    ", we use the static limit of our green s function here to investigate the conservative portion of the dynamics ; to compute the effective potential between well separated test masses orbiting around @xmath8 .    in the current paper",
    "we address the dissipative aspect of the dynamics : does motion of matter lying well within the vainshtein radius of @xmath8 produce galileon radiation that can carry energy - momentum away to infinity ?",
    "this question arises as an issue of principle because the galileon is a massless scalar field , and one would expect the motion of sources of massless fields to create radiation .",
    "yet , it is not clear how much radiation would actually be produced , because it could perhaps be suppressed by the vainshtein mechanism .    beyond issues of principle , we are also motivated by the possibility that one can constrain modified gravity theories by demanding that the power loss from binary pulsar systems , such as the hulse - taylor binary psr b1913 + 16 , had better not deviate too far from the predictions of gr , since observations have confirmed the latter to high precision .",
    "furthermore , we look forward to the prospect that , as already alluded to , within the next decade or so gw detectors may be able to directly listen in on the spacetime ripples generated by such compact binary systems .",
    "once this is possible , we may hope to use these gw signals to search for or put further constraints on the existence of the vainshtein mechanism .",
    "this requires that we develop a quantitative prediction of the galileon waves themselves , beyond just an estimate of the power loss through scalar emission .",
    "even though the two comparable point mass galileon problem possibly requires different techniques to solve due to the importance of the nonlinearities of the field equations , the results of our current paper , which assume the existence of a very large central mass , may perhaps be seen as an approximation to the situation where the inspiraling binary consists of rather unequal masses , say @xmath9 .",
    "yet another possible source of gws is the oscillations of neutron stars themselves ; as such , we will also consider a toy problem of surface waves on a spherical body stimulating galileon waves .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    ", we set up our problem in a quantitative manner . in section",
    "we summarize the results for the galileon retarded green s function about the background field of the central mass @xmath8 ; and following that in section we step through its derivation . in section",
    "we describe how the linearized equations of motion of the galileon field propagating about the background sourced by @xmath8 is equivalent to a minimally coupled massless scalar in some curved spacetime .",
    "then in section we move on to use the retarded galileon green s function to study two examples of radiative processes : galileon radiation produced by surface waves on an otherwise spherical central body , and that generated by @xmath10 point masses gravitationally bound to @xmath8 . in appendix , we work out both the curved and minkowski spacetime minimally coupled massless scalar analog of the linard - wiechert potentials in electromagnetism ; this spacetime calculation complements the frequency space one in section .",

    "we shall treat it as a point particle at rest , located at the spatial origin @xmath26 of the coordinate system .",
