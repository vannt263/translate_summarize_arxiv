    "the hot ( @xmath0kev ; central density , @xmath1@xmath2 ) x - ray emitting gas found in rich clusters of galaxies is an excellent tool to probe the cluster dynamics , morphology , and history .",
    "we present here an x - ray study of abell 85 ( @xmath3 , richness class @xmath4 , b - m type iii ) using new xmm - newton data obtained in january 2002 and public data available from the chandra archive .    at the distance of abell 85",
    ", 1 arcmin corresponds to @xmath5kpc ( assuming @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "abell  85 was observed in august 2001 by the chandra satellite ( p.i . c. sarazin ) with the acis - i detector .",
    "the net exposure time was @xmath8  ks .",
    "figure [ fig : a85_acis_i_cor ] shows the chandra x - ray image and the chandra isocontours superimposed on a dss optical image . notice the irregular form of the south blob and the excess x - ray emission at the south - west of the main structure .",
    "the two xmm - newton observations were performed on january 7th , 2002 ( p.i .",
    "f. durret ) .",
    "the two exposures were centered on the centre of abell  85 ( coincident with the cd galaxy ) and on the south filament respectively .",
    "both exposure times were @xmath9  ks .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : a85_acis_centrezoom ] shows a close - up of the central region seen by chandra .",
    "about 15 arcsec southward of the central x - ray maximum there seems to be a `` hole '' or `` bubble '' in the x - ray emissivity .",
    "there is also a small x - ray point source ( which is associated with an optical counterpart ) just a few arcsecs to the east of this `` hole '' .",
    "such a `` hole '' may be produced by the relativistic jets ( cf .",
    "ensslin et al 1998 ) either from the central dominant galaxy or from the object associated with the x - ray point source .",
    "some hot bubbles have been observed in a number of clusters ( mazzotta et al .",
    "2002a , b ; soker et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the south blob ( the second brightest diffuse sub - structure ) is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : a85_acis_centrezoom ] .",
    "notice that it is a highly irregular sub - structure , with the x - ray emission dominated by a point source ( a bright galaxy at the redshift of the cluster , see also lima neto et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : a85_m1_tudo8000_pspc ] shows the mosaic xmm image obtained after combining both observations .",
    "the images are the merged data from epic - mos 1 and 2 in the [ 0.38.0 ]  kev band .",
    "it is clear that abell  85 has a diffuse emission extending southward ; we interpret this as part of a filament .",
    "figure  [ fig : a85_filam_m12pn_8000smo ] shows a zoom of the filament region .",
    "filaments are expected to connect cluster in the hierarchical scenario of large scale structure formation ( e.g. jenkins et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we have computed the temperature and metallicity maps from chandra data by dividing the central region of abell 85 into a mesh and , for each cell , fitting an absorbed mekal plasma model ( kaastra & mewe 1993 ; liedahl et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : a85_kt_acisi2 ] shows the temperature and metallicity maps .",
    "the x - ray isocontours are overlaid on each map .",
    "the cluster is found to be cooler in the central regions where the metallicity is higher .",
    "figure [ fig : t_z - r_chandra - beppo ] shows the radial profiles of temperature and metal abundance computed in circular rings around the cluster centre .",
    "notice that there is a significant difference when we fix or not the absorbing hydrogen column density .",
    "when fixed , we used the galactic value given by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) , available with the ftools package .",
    "we compare these profiles to those obtained by lima neto et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using bepposax data . with the low resolution of bepposax , the central region profile is not adequately determined . with chandra acis - i",
    ", there is a clear temperature drop towards the centre .",
    "we also observe a steep rise in the metallicity towards the centre .",
    "the high resolution and sensibility of xmm - newton and chandra satellite provides us with a new vision of an old cluster ( quoting a meeting in marseille five years ago ... ) :    * the x - ray emission in the central region is not totally homogeneous or symmetric : the maximum is displaced relatively to the outer isophotes , a `` hole '' seems to exist south of the center ; * the temperature is cooler and the metallicity is higher in the central regions of the cluster than was previous measured ; * the existence of an x - ray filament , or at least diffuse x - ray emission south east of the cluster is confirmed ; the south blob is definitely not a relaxed structure ."
