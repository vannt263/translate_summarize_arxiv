    "models of the electronic structure of the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors ( htcs ) , where charged quasiparticles of the copper - oxygen planes are coupled to spin fluctuations ( sf ) ( for review see refs .  )",
    "possess two appealing features .",
    "( a ) they provide a straightforward explanation of the symmetry of the order parameter and ( b ) the same value of the coupling constant leads both to a fairly good agreement between theory and experiment for the normal state and to values of @xmath10 of @xmath11 .    on the other hand ,",
    "these models suffer two important deficiencies .",
    "( a ) they can not be rigorously derived starting from a well established microscopic hamiltonian such as the hamiltonian of the 2d one - band hubbard model .",
    "they can only be motivated by some perturbation expansions of the latter . within the",
    "so called conserving fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite , e.g. , an important term in the expression for the quasiparticle selfenergy @xmath12 reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are the fermion ( boson ) matsubara frequencies , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the number of momentum points , and @xmath18 is the hubbard parameter .",
    "further , @xmath19 is the dressed quasiparticle propagator and @xmath20 the random - phase - approximation(rpa)-based expression for the spin susceptibility .",
    "the expression for the selfenergy used within the sf - based models has precisely the same structure : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the model coupling constant and spin susceptibility , respectively .",
    "this can be considered as a kind of formal justification of the sf - based approaches . a typical value of @xmath22 of @xmath24 , however , is an order of magnitude lower than that of @xmath18 resulting from first - principles calculations of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "( b ) the second problem of the sf - based models concerns the choice of the function @xmath23 . in the spirit of the models",
    ", @xmath23 should match the true spin susceptibility @xmath26 accessible to experimental investigations .",
    "unfortunately , the available experimental data are not yet sufficient to determine @xmath26 in the relevant spectral range .",
    "this applies especially to the normal state ( ns ) of optimum doped and overdoped materials , where the spin fluctuations are relatively weak .",
    "the form of @xmath23 has thus to be guessed , at least to some extent . in the classical series of papers , monthoux _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have adopted the millis - monien - pines formula@xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the antiferromagnetic wave vector , @xmath29 is the in - plane lattice parameter , @xmath30 the antiferromagnetic coherence length , and @xmath31 is the parameter that specifies the frequency of the relaxation mode ( at a fixed  @xmath32 , @xmath33 exhibits a broad maximum centered at @xmath34 $ ] , i.e. , a relaxation mode ) .",
    "the situation is simpler for the superconducting state ( scs ) , where a sharp resonance in @xmath26 (  magnetic mode \" ) centered at @xmath35 , @xmath28 , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , has been detected in neutron scattering experiments ( see refs .",
    ", , , and references therein ) .",
    "for some compounds the shape of the resonance is well known and it is thus possible to investigate the coupling between the mode and the charge carriers without any _ ad hoc _ assumptions regarding the form of @xmath23 .",
    "let us emphasize that there must be a coupling between the well defined mode and the well defined bogoliubov quasiparticles and it should be considered in any theory of superconductivity in the htcs , in particular , when describing single - particle excitations ( observed by photoemission ) and two - particle excitations ( observed , among others , by optics ) .",
    "such considerations may help to clarify the role played by the sf in the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "the single - particle case has been reviewed in detail in refs .   and .",
    "an important observation is that the peak - dip - hump structure observed in superconducting - state angle - resolved - photoemission spectra ( for review see ref .  ) at and around @xmath38",
    "can be understood and described in terms of the above mentioned coupling .",
    "this result , together with several other findings , suggests that the sf are an important player in the mechanism . in this work we focus on the influence of the coupling on the in - plane infrared response of the htcs in the superconducting state .",
    "the sf - based approach has been pioneered in this context by schachinger , carbotte , and marsiglio @xcite and by quinlan , hirschfeld , and scalapino @xcite .",
    "the former group used the boson spectral density proportional to @xmath39 , in the work of the latter @xmath40 has been used .",
    "the real part of the in - plane infrared conductivity , @xmath41 , resulting from these computations exhibits the following trends : ( i ) below @xmath10 and for frequencies lower than @xmath42 , where @xmath6 is the maximum value of the superconducting gap , it decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "( ii ) it does not possess a true energy gap , even at very low temperatures and in the absence of any impurity scattering .",
    "instead , at low temperatures , it increases gradually with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "( iii ) the increase becomes steeper above the characteristic spin - fluctuation frequency of @xmath44@xcite or @xmath6 - @xmath45@xcite .",
    "( iv ) a very broad maximum appears in the low - temperature spectra around @xmath42 .",
    "these findings are roughly consistent with experimental data @xcite , except for two features .",
    "first , the data contain additional sharp structures at low frequencies .",
    "these are probably related to charge inhomogeneities and will not be discussed here .",
    "second , the increase of @xmath41 in the data appears to be less gradual than in the theoretical spectra .",
    "the data rather seem to exhibit an onset starting around @xmath46 .",
    "this may be related to the presence of a sharp feature in the spin - fluctuation spectra below @xmath10 , i.e. , to the magnetic mode , which has not been considered in refs .   and .",
    "the mode has been taken into account by two of the authors and m.  cardona ( mbc)@xcite , who employed a form of @xmath23 reflecting the results of the neutron scattering experiments : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the broadening of the resonance mode and  @xmath49 expresses its  oscillator strength \" .",
    "this study provided a tentative interpretation of the onset feature : the final states consist , in the first approximation , of two bogoliubov quasiparticles and the magnetic mode ; the minimum excitation energy is thus @xmath50 and the broad maximum around @xmath51 corresponds to excitations involving quasiparticles around the saddle point and the mode .",
    "carbotte , schachinger , and basov ( csb)@xcite also interpreted the data in terms of the magnetic mode but an inverse strategy has been used .",
    "their approach is based on a relation between the conductivity and the electron - phonon spectral density @xmath52 that applies to the normal state of a weakly coupled isotropic electron - phonon system @xcite : @xmath53\\ , ,      \\label{eq : wom1}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the plasma frequency of the free charge carriers .",
    "csb assumed ( and to some extent verified by computing @xmath55 within eliashberg formalism ) that a slightly modified equation , @xmath56\\ , ,      \\label{eq : wom2}\\ ] ] can be used to obtain the  effective electron - spin - fluctuation spectral function \" @xmath57 of a @xmath58-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "the main point of csb is that @xmath59 , as determined from the optical data , contains a sharp structure that is fairly similar to the one of @xmath60 , i.e. , to the neutron resonance .",
    "based on this finding , csb concluded that the infrared data reflect a coupling of the charge carriers to the magnetic mode . the coupling strength inferred from experiment",
    "is found to be sufficient to account for the high value of @xmath10 .",
    "the relation between @xmath41 and the magnetic mode has been further explored by abanov , chubukov , and schmalian ( acs ) @xcite .",
    "for example , they predicted a sharp onset of @xmath41 located at @xmath61 ( see fig .  2 of ref .  ) .",
    "the three approaches ( mbc , csb , acs ) differ in their emphasis and computational formalism .",
    "mbc showed that the superconducting - state infrared data can be understood in terms of the sf - based model with the spin susceptibility in the form of the neutron peak and focused on the onset in the conductivity spectra starting , according to the model , around @xmath2 .",
    "csb found an approximate solution of the inverse problem , the spectral function @xmath3 , and attributed its main maximum to the magnetic mode shifted by @xmath6 towards higher frequencies .",
    "finally , acs concentrated on the contribution to the conductivity of the so called hot spots , i.e. , intercepts of the fermi surface and the antiferromagnetic - brillouin - zone ( bz ) boundary , and they argued that this contribution is the dominant one .",
    "regarding the formalism , all the three groups expressed the quasiparticle selfenergy using the scs version of eq .",
    "[ eq : selfen2 ] and the conductivity using the textbook formulas @xcite , where the vertex corrections are neglected .",
    "the differences consist in treating the propagator @xmath19 and the susceptibility @xmath23 . in the work of mcb",
    ", @xmath19 is replaced with the bare nambu matrix containing an estimated superconducting gap of @xmath62 symmetry , i.e. , with the bcs expression .",
    "the approach is thus not self - consistent . on the other hand",
    ", it has two important advantages , not shared by the other two approaches , besides its formal simplicity : ( a ) it is not restricted to models , where the sf are the only cause of superconductivity .",
    "( b ) the full @xmath63-dependence of @xmath26 is taken into account .",
    "the same approach has been used in the studies of the single - particle properties by eschrig and norman and coworkers ( see ref .   and references therein ) and , in the context of electron - phonon interaction , by sandvik , scalapino , and bickers @xcite .",
    "csb obtain the propagator @xmath19 by solving eliashberg equations with a separable interaction , i.e. , in a selfconsistent way .",
    "acs use an approximate form of these equations valid in a region around the hot spots .",
    "not only the propagator but also the spin susceptibility is treated in a self - consistent way .",
    "the structures in the conductivity spectra can be relatively easily related to and understood in terms of those of the quasiparticle spectral functions ( in the absence of vertex corrections ) .",
    "such an analysis , however , has not yet been performed , except for some observations regarding the contributions of the hot spots @xcite and the optical scattering rate @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of the present paper is to provide a detailed interpretation of the onset starting around @xmath2 discussed by mbc and of the main maximum of the function @xmath3 emphasized by csb in terms of the quasiparticle spectral function . among others ,",

    "for the conventional shape of the @xmath58-gap the onset is very gradual but it becomes steeper with increasing broadening of the nodes . the maximum of @xmath3 has been shown to be due to the appearance above @xmath420 of excitations of the nodal region , consisting of a nodal particle , an antinodal particle and the mode . due to the brillouin zone averaging , in particular , due a considerable contribution of the intermediate region , the maximum of @xmath3 appears at a frequency @xmath319 which is slightly higher but considerably lower than @xmath421 .",
