    "the fabrication of si - mosfet samples with a narrow gate barrier or with narrow slots in the gate  @xcite has given rise to new experimental possibilities .",
    "in particular , samples with a narrow gate barrier  @xcite were used for investigation of the backscattering of the edge current in the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) regime , while the slot - gate geometry has permitted reliable measurements of a two - dimensional electron transport in case of low electron density  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the slot - gate geometry to measure the longitudinal resistance @xmath0 in the qhe regime for unequal electron densities along the sample .",
    "our aim was to reveal the influence of the spin - flip process on the electron transport when electrons on the opposite sides of the slot occupy landau levels ( ll ) with different spin orientations .",
    "the sample with two narrow slots ( 100  nm ) in the upper metallic gate was similar to that described earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "application of different gate voltages @xmath1 to the gates @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 permitted one to maintain different electron densities @xmath5 in different parts of the sample .",
    "as a function of magnetic field at fixed gate voltages @xmath6v ; _ b _  longitudinal resistance @xmath0 measured between probes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( ) and between probes @xmath8 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( ) at @xmath12v .",
    "the insert shows the schematics of the slot - gate sample . ]      in the first series of experiments , all gates were connected .",
    "the magnetic field dependences of the hall ( transverse ) resistance @xmath17 measured between probes @xmath18@xmath19 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]_a_. the `` plateaus '' are clearly seen only for landau filling factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponding to the hall resistances @xmath22 and @xmath23 , correspondingly .",
    "clear `` plateaus '' in @xmath17 at @xmath24 are usually not observed in si - mosfet being `` contaminated '' by the `` overshoot '' effect @xcite .    the longitudinal resistance @xmath0 was measured across the gap between voltage probes @xmath25 and @xmath18 @xmath26 and without the gap , between probes @xmath18 and @xmath27 @xmath28 . in zero magnetic field , @xmath9 is 1.5 times larger than @xmath11 ( fig .  [ fig1]_b _ ) due to the distance between probes 1 and 2 being 1.5 times larger than that between probes 2 and 3 .",
    "therefore , the longitudinal resistance is not affected by the existence of the narrow slot in the gate . in other words , in our sample , the narrow slot in the upper gate does not lead to the existence of a potential barrier .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that at magnetic fields above 10 t , both resistance curves merge .",
    "this can be explained by the influence of the edge channels @xcite , so that the length between probes becomes irrelevant .    in case of different gate voltages",
    "@xmath29 ( @xmath30 was always equal to @xmath31 ) , the difference in the transverse hall voltages @xmath32 appears .",
    "@xmath33 is added to the longitudinal voltage @xmath34 only on one side of the sample , depending on the gradient of the gate voltage @xmath35 , which makes the longitudinal resistance non - symmetric : for @xmath36 at given direction of the magnetic field @xmath37 , @xmath33 was added to the voltage @xmath38 , while for @xmath39 , @xmath38 remains unchanged ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]_a , b _ ) . on the opposite side of the sample ,",
    "the situation is reverse : @xmath33 is added to the voltage drop @xmath40 for @xmath39 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the sample side where @xmath33 is added to @xmath41 is determined by the vector product @xmath42 .",
    "different values of @xmath41 on the opposite sides of the sample mean that in order to analyse the longitudinal resistance in the case of different gate voltages , one need to subtract properly the contribution of the hall voltage difference .     measured",
    "when @xmath43 .",
    "_ a _   @xmath9 measured when @xmath36 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) ( curve  ) ; @xmath9 for the case of equal gate voltages @xmath46 is shown for comparison ( curve  ) ; _ b _   @xmath9 measured when @xmath39 ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) ( curve  ) , @xmath9 for the case of equal gate voltages @xmath49 is shown for comparison ( curve  ) . ]    in another set of experiments , conducted at @xmath50mk , the magnetic field was fixed at 8  tesla , while the gate voltage was varied .",
    "first , all gates were connected and @xmath51 was measured between probes @xmath25 and @xmath52 ( figure  [ fig3 ] , blue line ) . using the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]_a _ , one can conclude that the `` plateau '' at around @xmath53v corresponds to the filling factor @xmath21 , while the `` plateaus '' at around @xmath54v and @xmath55v correspond to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , correspondingly .",
    "figure  [ fig4]_a _ shows @xmath41 measured simultaneously on both sides of the sample between probes @xmath25@xmath18 and probes @xmath52@xmath19 .",
    "@xmath58 was kept constant , while @xmath59 was varied from 5v to 15v . in this experiment ,",
    "the gradient of the gate voltage undergoes a sign change at @xmath60 .",
    "if the direction of the magnetic field is reversed , the curves trade places .",
    "the difference between the two curves @xmath61 plotted as a function of @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , red line ) practically coincides with @xmath62 .",
    "this fact allows us to subtract properly the contribution of the hall voltage difference : one need to take into account only the lower parts of the both curves .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]_b_.    let us discuss the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]_b_. keeping constant @xmath58 means that electrons underneath the gate @xmath3 always occupy the sixth ll with spin `` down '' ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and the inset ) .",
    "when @xmath59 is varied from 9v to 11v , electrons across the slot occupy the same ( 6th ) ll and , therefore , have the same spin orientation .",
    "however , when 7v@xmath639v and 12v@xmath6314v , the electrons underneath the gate @xmath2 occupy `` spin up '' lls 4 and 8 , correspondingly . at both filling factors @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( indicated in the figure by arrows ) , the longitudinal resistance increases compared to the @xmath66 case .",
    "possible reason for this resistance increase is some additional scattering  @xcite due to the necessity for electrons to flip their spins when crossing the slot .",

    "we are grateful to a. bogush and a. belostotsky for assistance ."
