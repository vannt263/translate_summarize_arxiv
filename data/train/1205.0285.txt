    "isotropic networks of wlcs have been studied extensively in experiment @xcite , driven by the interest in biological networks such as the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix .",
    "theoretical approaches have dealt with entangled solution @xcite as well as chemically cross - linked networks of wlcs @xcite . the former build on the tube model whereas the latter generalise concepts from rubber elasticity .",
    "aligning linkers can give rise to a variety of morphologies which have been studied by means of a generalised onsager approach @xcite as well as within a microscopic model @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are bundles of filaments which occur in a broad range of cytosceletal structures and show much richer elastic behaviour than the usual wlc @xcite .",
    "two parallel - aligned , stretched semiflexible filaments cross - linked by a motor cluster have been used as the minimal elastic element of an active gel @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider an anisotropic network of wlcs which have been aligned along a preferred axis chosen as the @xmath0direction .",
    "the alignment is not due to cross - links which we model as springs .",
    "instead possible mechanisms for alignment are a nematic environment , pulling forces , grafting surfaces or the onsager mechanism .",
    "a sketch of such a network is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : network ] .",
    "if the alignment is strong , the wlc model can be replaced by a weakly bending chain ( wbc ) as first suggested by marco and siggia @xcite for dna molecules .",
    "the advantage for an analytical approach is enormous because the single chain model is gaussian .",
    "our focus in this paper lies on the force - extension curve of a randomly cross - linked anisotropic network of strongly aligned filaments .",
    "we first consider a toy model , consisting of two cross - linked filaments .",
    "the model allows us to disentangle the contributions to the effective extension which are due to either bending stiffnes or cross - links .",
    "subsequently , we analyse the effects of cross - links for a macroscopic network .",
    "our starting point is the energy of a stretched wlc in terms of the tangent vector @xmath1 , @xmath2= \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\int_0^l ds \\big(\\frac{d { \\bf t }      ( s)}{ds}\\big)^2-f\\int_0^l ds\\frac{dz}{ds}\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath3 denotes the bending stiffnes which is related to the persistence length @xmath4 via @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dimensionality of the embedding space .",
    "the pulling force is denoted by @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the arclength .",
    "the local inextensibility constraint of the wlc is expressed by the condition @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the chain is strongly stretched so that tilting of the tangent vector away from the @xmath0axis is small and we can use the approximation @xmath10 leading to the weakly bending model introduced by marco and siggia @xcite @xmath11= \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\int_0^l ds   \\big(\\frac{d^2 { \\bf r}_{\\perp }      ( s)}{ds^2}\\big)^2+\\frac{f}{2}\\int_0^l ds\\big(\\frac{d { \\bf r}_{\\perp }      ( s)}{ds}\\big)^2\\ ] ] the central quantity of interest is the extension of the chain under an applied force @xmath7 , which in the weakly bending approximation is computed from the thermal fluctuations transverse to the aligning direction : @xmath12",
    "before addressing the full problem of a randomly cross - linked array of aligned chains , we discuss the much simpler case of two strongly stretched chains in two dimensions with one cross - link in the middle , see fig .",
    "[ fig : two_chains ] .        in two dimensions , @xmath13 and the hamiltonian reads @xmath14+{\\cal    h}_0[y_1(s)]+\\frac{g}{2}\\big(y_1({l}/{2})-y_2({l}/{2})\\big)^2\\ ] ] the cross - link is modeled as a harmonic spring of stiffness @xmath15 . for simplicity",
    "we impose hinged - hinged boundary conditions : @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the two chains which are a distance @xmath18 apart ( the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath19 ) . according to the boundary conditions that we use ,",
    "the eigenfunction representation should be @xmath20 and wavenumbers are restricted to values @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "these eigenfunctions diagonalise the hamiltonian of the weakly bending chain , whereas the cross - link gives rise to a term which is quadratic in the amplitudes but not diagonal . introducing vectors @xmath23 and matrices @xmath24 the hamiltonian",
    "is rewritten as @xmath25 with @xmath26 the matrix @xmath27 is easily inverted : @xmath28 so that we can compute the force - extension curve , say of chain 1 , exactly @xmath29    our model has three characteristic energies : the bending energy , @xmath30 , the work done by the external force , @xmath31 and the thermal energy , @xmath32 ( we set @xmath33 ) .",
    "use of the weakly bending approximation requires @xmath34 ( which is equivalent to @xmath35 ) or @xmath36 .",
    "this leaves us with one free parameter , @xmath37 , namely the ratio of work done by the external force to bending energy .",
    "this dimensionless quantity can also be interpreted as the squared ratio of two lengthscales : the total contour length @xmath38 to the length @xmath39 over which the boundary conditions penetrate into the bulk ( i.e. , the size of a link in an effective freely - jointed chain ) @xcite .",
    "actually , we have two additional lengthscales , the distance between chains , @xmath18 , which we assume to be negligible and the length of the cross - link ( @xmath40 or alternatively the energy of a cross - link relative to the work done by the pulling force , @xmath41 .    the result for general @xmath42 and cross - link strength @xmath15 @xmath43 can be decomposed into a contribution , @xmath44 , which is characteristic for a weakly bending chain and well - known from the work of marko and siggia @xcite and a contribution due to the cross - link , @xmath45 @xmath46 in the limit of large @xmath42 , the cross - link contribution is given by @xmath47 for soft cross - links @xmath45 falls off as @xmath48 , whereas in the limit of hard cross - links , @xmath49 , we find @xmath50 . in any case",
    ", the contribution of the cross - link is subdominant in the limit of strong pulling force .",
    "note that @xmath45 is independent of @xmath3 , which shows us that the contribution from the cross - link is purely entropic .",
    "this contribution could in fact be evaluated from a directed polymer model which does not involve any bending rigidity .",
    "collecting the leading terms for hard cross - links and strong pulling force , yields @xmath51 here we have restored the term due to a finite distance , @xmath18 , between the chains , which gives rise to a geometric reduction in length due to the cross - link .",
    "this term is presumably unimportant in a network , where @xmath52 is expected to be small .",
    "this term will be neglected in the following .",
    "the weakly bending approximation is satisfied as long as the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ full ] ) is small .",
    "we point out that , in the case of @xmath53 , this approximation is fulfilled even without having very large @xmath42 ( strong stretching ) .",
    "we show the relative extension as a function of pulling force in fig .",
    "[ fig : force_extension ] for hard cross - links . as discussed",
    ", cross - linking enhances the extension due to the reduction of thermal fluctuations , but the effect becomes less and less pronounced in the strong stretching limit .",
    "it is also of interest to consider a situation , where a strong pulling force has been applied and subsequently the change in extension in response to a small change in the pulling force is measured .",
    "this response is determined by the differential stiffness @xmath54 . in fig .",

    "however for weakly stretched chains the enhancement is considerable .",
    "in this section , we are going to compute the force - extension relation of a randomly cross - linked ensemble of oriented chains approximately .",
    "we are guided by the result for the cross - linked pair of chains , which consists of a single chain contribution , @xmath55 , and a contribution due to the cross - link , @xmath56 , which is independent of the bending rigidity @xmath3 .",
    "we decompose the calculation for the network accordingly : in the uncross - linked network , the force - extension relation is determined by the single chain contribution . to assess the effect of cross - linking , we compute the free energy difference of the cross - linked network relative to the uncross - linked system .",

    "the latter are modelled by harmonic springs @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a quenched configuration of @xmath65 cross - links connecting polymers @xmath66 at arclength @xmath67 .",
    "the partition function of the cross - linked system relative to the uncross - linked melt for a specific realization of cross - links , @xmath68 , reads @xmath69 here @xmath70 denotes the thermal average over all polymer configurations with the boltzmann weight @xmath71 of the uncross - linked melt @xmath72 + { \\cal h}_{\\text{ev}}$ ] .",
    "physical observables can be calculated from the quenched - disorder averaged free energy , @xmath73 $ ] , where @xmath74 $ ] denotes average over all realizations of random cross - links .",
    "we assume that the number of cross - links can vary and a realization with @xmath65 cross - links follows the deam - edwards distribution @xcite : @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 controls the average number of cross - links per polymer and the physical meaning of this distribution is that polymer segments close to each other in the melt have a high probabiblity to be linked .",

    "the above model is expected to have a gelation transition @xcite at a critical cross - link concentration @xmath80 .",
    "as far as the force - extension relation is concerned , we expect to find the single polymer contribution ( marko - siggia ) below the gelation transition and a correction due to cross - links above it .",
    "the latter will be computed from the directed polymer model ( @xmath81 ) , because it is dominated by the long wavelength transverse excursions of the polymers which are correctly captured by the second term in eq .",
    "( [ wbch ] ) .",
    "a similar mechanism underlies the well - known observation @xcite that the tranverse fluctuations of a strongly stretched wormlike chain are independent of @xmath3 .",
    "we compute the free energy difference , @xmath82 , for a network of cross - linked directed polymers , confined between two planes with their endpoints free to slide on them .",
    "this calculation is analogous to our previous work on directed polymers @xcite and some details are layed out in the appendix .",
    "we point out that our calculation is restricted to the vicinity of the gel point . adding the single chain contribution and denoting the distance from the gelation point by @xmath83 , we find for the total mean force - extension    @xmath84 - 1 = -\\delta_{ms}-\\delta_{xl}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\delta_{ms}=\\;-\\frac{t}{(4\\kappa f)^{1/2}}+\\frac{t}{(2fl)}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\delta_{xl}=\\frac{\\epsilon^3}{3}\\frac{t}{fl+3f^2/g}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above result is quite remarkable in several respects .",
    "whereas the contribution due to bending shows the @xmath85 behaviour typical for wlc , the cross - link contribution is proportional to @xmath86 ( hard cross - links ) , which is characteristic of freely jointed chains . for strong",
    "stretching , @xmath87 , the cross - link contribution has qualitatively the same dependence on the pulling force , @xmath7 , and the cross - link strength , @xmath15 , as the corresponding contribution in the two - chain toy model of the previous section .",
    "there is a singular contribution to the stretching stiffness at the gelation transition , which has the same scaling as the shear modulus , namely @xmath88 . in analogy to the behaviour of the shear modulus in the well cross - linked regime @xcite , we expect the contribution of the cross - links to the force extension relation to scale as the density of cross - links , i.e. to be of the form @xmath89 .",
    "the excluded - volume interaction , which is included in the gelation theory in order to prevent collapse of the system upon cross - linking , does not affect the force - extension relation in the strong stretching regime . replacing the excluded - volume interaction of each chain with its neighbours by an effective harmonic `` cage '' @xcite ,",
    "one notices that for strong pulling forces the effect of the `` cage '' becomes negligible @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the effect of random cross - links on the force - extension relation of an array of parallel - aligned wlcs .",
    "our calculation is restricted to the strong stretching regime , close to the gelation transition .",
    "the main result is a contribution to the nonlinear force - extension relation which scales as @xmath90 for hard cross - links and suppresses the thermal flucuations thus stiffening the ( thermal ) stretching modulus .",
    "hard cross - links are sufficient in the large @xmath38 limit as the cross - link size @xmath91 enters through @xmath92 . our result is based on a replica field theory of randomly cross - linked directed polymers originally developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . remarkably , apart from numerical prefactors , the effect of cross - links is the same as in the case of a simple two - dimensional model with two chains and a single cross - link in the middle .",
    "an interesting extension of this work would consider cross - links which are non - local in the @xmath0-direction .",
    "that would imply discontinuities in the tension of the involved chains as discussed in ref .",
