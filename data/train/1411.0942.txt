    "the cyg ob 7 molecular cloud is a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) located at a distance of 800 pc @xcite in the direction of the cygnus region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cloud has an apparent size of @xmath7 centered at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and has a total molecular mass of @xmath10 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : location](a ) shows the entire extents of the cloud .",
    "there are two well - known star forming sites in the cloud .",
    "one is the region known as ldn 988 @xcite where a number of pre - main sequence stars are forming ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the other is a massive dense core known as the northern coal sack ( ncs ) producing a massive class 0 object @xcite . except for these two regions , star formation is much less active in this cloud compared to other gmcs with a similar mass ( e.g. , orion a , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is no extended h regions associated with the cloud .",
    "the cyg ob 7 molecular cloud is also characterized by its low temperature ( @xmath11 k ) and a large turbulence ( @xmath12 km s@xmath13 in @xmath14co , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has been regarded as a gmc in an early stage of cloud evolution prior to an active massive star formation .    in the all - sky visual ( vis ) and near - infrared ( nir ) extinction maps derived from the digitized sky survey ( dss , * ? ? ? * ) and the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we found a massive dense core in the northern part of the cyg ob 7 molecular cloud . in the dss - based extinction map ,",
    "the core is cataloged as tguh 541p1 by @xcite which corresponds to the eastern end of the dark nebula ldn 1004 @xcite . in the optically thinner 2mass - based extinction map , it splits into several smaller condensations such as",
    "the one numbered no.2996 in the catalog compiled by @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we shall refer to this core as l1004e in this paper .    in figure",
    "[ fig : location](b ) , we show the location of l1004e in the @xmath15 map produced by @xcite .",
    "as seen in the figure , the core is very large and is the densest in the entire cyg ob 7 cloud with the maximum @xmath15 of @xmath16 mag .",
    "based on the @xmath15 map , we estimate its total mass to be at least @xmath17 @xmath1 . in spite of its huge mass ,",
    "l1004e is not accompanied by any h regions or bright infrared sources representing massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) , indicating that l1004e is a core in an initial stage of massive star formation or cluster formation .",
    "l1004e should provide us a precious opportunity to investigate the initial conditions of such massive cores , because the initial conditions can be easily destroyed by the strong stellar wind and uv radiation from ob stars soon after they are formed in the cores .",
    "the angular resolutions of the 2mass- and dss- based extinction maps ( @xmath18 ) that we used to find l1004e are not sufficient to resolve the structure of the core .",
    "we therefore carried out molecular line observations at a high angular resolution using the 45 m telescope ( hpbw@xmath19 at 115 ghz ) at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) , which should also provide us information on the velocity field of the core .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to report results of the observations with the 45 m telescope .",
    "we observed the core in various molecular lines such as c@xmath4o .",
    "the observational procedures are described in section [ sec : observations ] . based mainly on the c@xmath4o data",
    ", we analyzed the spatial and velocity structure of the core , and we also searched for candidates of ysos associated with the core using some infrared point source catalogs ( pscs ) open to the public .",
    "we found that the core has a huge total mass of @xmath0 @xmath1 and is consisting of a number of massive filaments and core - like structures with a mass of @xmath6 @xmath1 , which appears similar to the filamentary structures recently evidenced in other molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to our surprise , some of the filaments are apparently colliding against each other , and some candidates of ysos are located around the intersections of the filaments as if they were induced by the collisions of the filaments .",
    "we present these observational results in section [ sec : results ] . in order to understand how the colliding filaments were formed in the core , we performed numerical simulations of core evolution assuming a model core with an initial mass and size similar to those of l1004e . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we describe the method and results of the simulations , and discuss what initial conditions are needed for the formation of such colliding filaments which should play an important role for massive star formation and cluster formation in massive cores .",
    "conclusions of this paper are summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "observations were carried out with the 45 m telescope at nro .",
    "we observed thirteen molecular lines in total , i.e. , @xmath20co@xmath21 , @xmath14co@xmath21 , c@xmath4o@xmath21 , cs@xmath22 , c@xmath23s@xmath22 , hco@xmath24 , h@xmath14co@xmath24 , hc@xmath25n@xmath26 , ccs@xmath27 , nh@xmath28 , nh@xmath29 , nh@xmath30 , and nh@xmath31 . the @xmath14co@xmath21 emission line was observed for 4 days in 2010 january , and the other lines were observed for 22 days in the period between 2009 february and 2009 may .",
    "our observations can be divided into two modes .",
    "one is the mapping observations to reveal the entire molecular distributions of l1004e , and the other is one - point observations made only toward the protostellar candidate iras 21025 + 5221 found in the core .",
    "the mapping observations were carried out with 6 molecular lines as summarized in table [ tab : mapping_obs ] .",
    "we used the 25 beam array receiver system ( bears ) to observe the emission lines of co and its isotopes .",
    "we also used an sis receiver named s40 to observe the hc@xmath25n and ccs lines at 45 ghz as well as a cooled hemt receiver named h22 to observe the nh@xmath32 line at 24 ghz .",
    "spectrometers were auto - correlators ( ac ) covering a band - width of either 32 mhz or 16 mhz with 1024 channels with a frequency resolution of 38 khz or 19 khz , respectively .",
    "we mapped an area of @xmath33 around the core using the on - the - fly ( otf ) technique @xcite , and calibrated the spectral data with the standard chopper - wheel method @xcite .",
    "reference positions ( i.e. , the emission - free off positions ) were ( @xmath34 , @xmath35)@xmath36 ( 20@xmath3738@xmath3833.9@xmath39 , 51@xmath4047@xmath4102@xmath42 ) , ( 20@xmath3749@xmath3834.5@xmath39 , 51@xmath4048@xmath4100@xmath42 ) , ( 20@xmath3758@xmath3837.0@xmath39 , 51@xmath4036@xmath4159@xmath42 ) , ( 21@xmath3704@xmath3806.5@xmath39 , 52@xmath4033@xmath4147@xmath42 ) for the @xmath20co , c@xmath4o , nh@xmath25 , and the other emission lines , respectively .",
    "we used the reduction software package nostar available at nro to subtract a linear baseline from the raw data and to resample the spectral data onto @xmath43 or @xmath44 grid along the equatorial coordinates .",
    "we then applied a correction for the main beam efficiencies which vary in the range @xmath45 % depending on the frequencies to the baseline - subtracted data in order to scale them to units of @xmath46 .",
    "further corrections for the side - band ratio were applied for the data obtained by bears , because it is a double - side - band ( dsb ) receiver .",
    "velocity channels are resampled onto 0.1 km s@xmath13 or 0.2 km s@xmath13 velocity grid , which resulted in a velocity resolution of @xmath47 km s@xmath13 .",
    "noise levels of the resulting data are @xmath48 k at these velocity resolutions as summarized in table [ tab : mapping_obs ] .",
    "one - point observations toward iras 21025 + 5221 were made with molecular lines as summarized in table [ tab : point_obs ] .",
    "for these observations , we used waveguide - type dual - polarization sideband - separating sis receivers called t100h / v @xcite to observe cs , c@xmath23s , hco@xmath49 , and h@xmath14co@xmath49 lines , and also used the h22 receiver to observe four nh@xmath50 lines of @xmath51 transitions .",
    "spectrometers were acousto - optical spectrometers ( aoss ) with a bandwidth of 40 mhz and a frequency resolution of 37 khz corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath52 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the baseline removal was done by using the reduction package newstar .",
    "the data were scaled up to units of @xmath46 in the same way as for the mapping data .",
    "the system noise temperatures @xmath53 were in the range @xmath54 k depending on the receivers including the atmosphere . pointing accuracy was better than @xmath55 as was checked by observing the sio maser t - cep at 43 ghz every 2 hours during the observations .",
    "figure [ fig : ii_maps ] shows the integrated intensity distributions of the observed emission line listed in table [ tab : mapping_obs ] . as seen in the figure , the c@xmath4o map in panel ( a ) reveals the filamentary structure of the core . on the other hand , the @xmath14co map in panel ( b ) shows rather flat distribution , because the line is heavily saturated .",
    "the @xmath20co emission line ( not shown ) extends all over the mapped area , and it appears much flatter .",
    "the other molecular emission lines , ie . , hc@xmath25n , css , and nh@xmath25 in panels ( c)(e ) , show clumpy distributions , and they are concentrated especially around iras 21025 + 5221 .    in figure [",
    "fig : w3 ] , we show the 12 @xmath56 image taken by the wise satellite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the c@xmath4o map in figure [ fig : ii_maps](a ) is very similar to the dust distribution revealed by wise , indicating that the molecular line is a good tracer of the total molecular column density @xmath57 . in order to estimate the mass of l1004e",
    ", we therefore derived @xmath57 at each observed position by analyzing the c@xmath4o data using a standard method assuming the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte , e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this",
    ", we first estimated the excitation temperature of c@xmath4o from the @xmath20co spectra at each observed position assuming that the @xmath20co emission line is optically very thick .",
    "we then calculated @xmath58(c@xmath4o ) the optical depth of the c@xmath4o emission line and its column density @xmath59(c@xmath4o ) , and converted @xmath59(c@xmath4o ) to @xmath59(h@xmath60 ) using an empirical conversion relation found by @xcite .",
    "we summarize the method in the appendix .",
    "the analyses of the c@xmath4o and @xmath20co data infer that l1004e has a huge mass of @xmath61 @xmath1 within the region mapped in c@xmath4o ( figure [ fig : ii_maps](a ) ) .",
    "this mass is much higher than other single dense cores found in low - mass star forming regions such as taurus ( @xmath62 @xmath1 , * ? ? ? * ) or in massive star forming regions found in the vicinity of some h regions ( @xmath6 @xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting that l1004e may comprise a number of distinct smaller cores . actually , as shown in section [ subset : filaments ] , l1004e is very likely to consist of several massive filaments having a mass of @xmath6 @xmath1 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the c@xmath4o column density of l1004e is very high compared with cores in other star forming regions .",
    "in fact , we found that the c@xmath4o emission line which is often optically thin ( @xmath63 ) in molecular clouds has a high optical depth of @xmath64 at the peak intensity positions in figure [ fig : ii_maps](a ) .",
    "figure [ fig : column_density ] shows the frequency distributions of @xmath59(c@xmath4o ) in l1004e compared with those of hlc 2 and ldn 1551 observed by the same nro 45 m telescope ( the data of these regions are open to the public at the website of nro , http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/@xmath65nro45mrt/results/data.html ) . as seen in the figure , l1004e exhibits much higher @xmath59(c@xmath4o ) than the others .",
    "on the basis of statistical studies of dense cores in taurus , @xcite showed that all of the cores with column density greater than @xmath59(h@xmath66)@xmath67 @xmath68 are accompanied by ysos selected from iras sources , and they suggested that the cores start to form stars immediately as soon as the column density exceeds the value .",
    "this critical value of @xmath59(h@xmath66 ) corresponds to @xmath59(c@xmath4o)@xmath69 @xmath68 ( see equation ( [ eq : nh2 ] ) in the appendix ) .",
    "as shown in the next subsection , there are only two iras sources as promising candidates of protostars in this massive core , suggesting that the core may be in a stage prior to an active star formation or may have just initiated forming stars .",
    "l1004e is also characterized by its low temperature . within the observed region ,",
    "the excitation temperature derived from the @xmath20co emission line varies in the range @xmath70 k with a mean value of @xmath71 k , which is lower than those in other gmcs with a similar size ( e.g. , @xmath72 k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but close to those in smaller dark clouds such as the one in taurus ( e.g. , @xmath11 k , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there is a clear tendency that @xmath73 is lower in the central part of the core than in the outskirts by a few kelvin .",
    "similarly , the observed line width measured by applying a single gaussian fitting to the c@xmath4o emission line varies in the range @xmath74 km s@xmath13 with a mean value of @xmath752 km s@xmath13 in the region surrounded by the lowest contour in figure [ fig : ii_maps](a ) , and it tends to be smaller where the c@xmath4o intensity is higher , suggesting dissipation of turbulence in the central part of the core .",
    "we summarize the global properties of l1004e found through the above @xmath20co and c@xmath4o analyses in table [ tab : core ] .    finally , we show the velocity distributions of molecular gas in a series of channel maps in figures [ fig : channelmap_13co_0][fig : channelmap_c18o_1 ] . molecular emission lines , especially the @xmath20co line ( not shown ) , spread over a wide velocity range of @xmath76 km s@xmath13 , but the other emission lines concentrate in a rather limited range around @xmath77 km s@xmath13 ( see figure [ fig : channelmap_13co_0 ] displaying the @xmath14co distributions ) .",
    "figures [ fig : channelmap_13co_1 ] and [ fig : channelmap_c18o_1 ] show channel maps of @xmath14co and c@xmath4o , respectively , produced at a higher velocity resolution of 0.5 km s@xmath13 .",
    "these figures show that denser parts of the core exhibits an elongated structure , and the core apparently consist of a number of filaments having slightly different velocities .",
    "the filaments are clearer in the c@xmath4o channel maps in figure [ fig : channelmap_c18o_1 ]",
    ". we will attempt to identify the individual filaments and will further analyze their stability and interactions in section [ subset : filaments ] .      in order to search for ysos in the observed region , we selected candidates of ysos in the iras psc using the criteria suggested by @xcite for a search of ysos in the taurus cloud complex : we selected sources detected at least 3 bands including 25 @xmath56 and 60 @xmath56 satisfying the conditions log@xmath78 and log@xmath79 where @xmath80 means a flux density at 12 @xmath56 , and so on . as a result , we found only 2 iras sources in the observed region .",
    "they are iras 21005 + 5217 and 21025 + 5221 whose properties are listed in table [ tab : iras ] . both of the iras sources have a cold fir spectra typical of ysos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , having a total far - infrared ( fir ) luminosity @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "note that these are the bolometric luminosities detected only in the four iras bands ( including the correction for wavelengths longer than100 @xmath56 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the flux in the wavelengths shorter than 12 @xmath56 is not included .",
    "we further searched for ysos in the wise psc using the selection criteria suggested by @xcite , which is to select candidates of class i and class ii sources @xcite from the wise psc .",
    "the criteria require detection in the wise 3.4 @xmath56 , 4.6 @xmath56 , and 12 @xmath56 bands with rather complex limitations in magnitudes and colors in the 3 bands to exclude non - ysos objects such as galaxies , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , unresolved knots of shock emission due to outflows , and so on ( for details , see the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a result",
    ", we found a score of candidates for class i or class ii sources in the observed region , but they are mostly located outside of the denser parts of the core , suggesting that many of them are the sources either in the foreground or background , not having physical association with the core .",
    "we should note , however , that there may be more faint ysos in the wise psc , which were excluded by the tight selection criteria of @xcite . as they state in their paper , it is difficult in general to establish definite criteria to select ysos perfectly .",
    "their criteria have a strong restriction especially on the magnitudes of the sources in order to exclude agns , i.e. , the apparent magnitudes at 3.4 @xmath56 and 4.6 @xmath56 have to be brighter than 14.0 and 13.5 mag , respectively ( see their section a.1 ) .",
    "if we disregard these restrictions to exclude agns , we would find more candidates of faint ysos .",
    "actually , we found a score of such faint sources lying along the filaments of the core , which are likely to be ysos forming therein . in the original wise psc , however , it seems that there are a certain fraction of false detections probably caused by the algorithm to extract point sources from the wise images .",
    "in order to avoid such false detections , we checked by eyes the locations of the point sources on the wise images , and selected only those having an apparent counterpart at least in one of the four band images of wise ( i.e. , 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath56 ) . as a result",
    ", we found 83 candidates of ysos ( i.e. , 50 class i sources and 33 class ii sources ) within the area mapped in c@xmath4o including the above faint sources without the restrictions to exclude agns . the 2 iras sources are also included in these numbers because they have a counterpart in the selected wise sources .",
    "we show locations of the these sources in figure [ fig : ysos ] , and we shall regard them as ysos forming in l1004e .    here",
    "we attempt to estimate the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of l1004e .",
    "a certain fraction of the 83 sources should be agns or ysos unrelated to the core , but for simplicity , we shall assume that all of them are ysos forming in the core .",
    "we also assume that their average mass is @xmath84 @xmath1 which is the mean value of stars following the salpeter s mass function ( @xmath85 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) over the range @xmath86 @xmath1 .",
    "these assumptions yield an estimate of the sfe of only @xmath87 % , because the total molecular mass of the core is @xmath88 @xmath1 ( see table [ tab : core ] ) .",
    "this value of sfe is much lower compared with other massive cores forming clusters ( e.g. , sfe@xmath89 % on the average , * ? ? ?",
    "note that this is the maximum estimate for the sfe , because a certain fraction of the wise sources should be unrelated to l1004e . in an extreme case ,",
    "if we take that only the 2 iras sources and several bright wise sources which are located where the c@xmath4o emission is strong are promising ysos forming in l1004e , a very low sfe of only @xmath90 % would inferred , which should be the minimum estimate of the sfe in l1004e .",
    "we found that the 2 iras sources selected as candidates of ysos have a counterpart not only in the wise psc but also in the 2mass psc , as summarized in table [ tab : counterparts ] .",
    "iras 21025 + 5221 is probably a younger yso than iras 21005 + 5217 , because it is not detected in the @xmath91 and @xmath92 bands of 2mass , while iras 21005 + 5217 is not detected in the iras 100 @xmath56 band . in order to better access the stellar properties of these sources such as the ages , masses , and luminosities , we employed a recent stellar model developed by robitaille et al . @xcite .",
    "the model was first developed by @xcite , and it comprises several parameters for the central star , circumstellar disk , and envelope , to calculate the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for a wide range of wavelengths that can be compared with the observations .",
    "tools for the model fitting are available on their website ( http://caravan.astro.wisc.edu/ ) which provide us 10,000 sets of the model parameters to fit observational data sorted according to the resulting @xmath93 .",
    "we utilized their tools on the web to fit the seds of the 2 iras sources using the observed parameters listed in tables [ tab : iras ] and [ tab : counterparts ] . resulting seds of the model best fitting",
    "the data are shown in figure [ fig : sed ] , and some of the best model parameters with the minimum @xmath93 are summarized in table [ tab : modelpara ] .",
    "the @xmath94 values in the first column of the table are the fitted total extinction along the line - of - sight to the stellar envelope , which is consistent with what we would expected from the observed column density of c@xmath4o .",
    "the other parameters ( age , mass , and luminosity ) are the best fitting parameters for the central star .",
    "looking into the best 10 sets of the model parameters with the smallest @xmath93 , these parameters summarized in the table seem to be well determined with small variations in the case of iras 21005 + 5217 , while the parameters are rather ambiguous in the case of iras 21025 + 5221 varying in the range @xmath95 yr , @xmath96 @xmath1 , and @xmath97 @xmath83 , which is mostly due to the lack of the data points in the @xmath91 and @xmath92 bands ( there are only the upper limits for these data points ) . in any case , iras 21025 + 5221 is obviously younger than the other source .",
    "we found that iras 21025 + 5221 is accompanied by a small and well - defined molecular condensation which should be the direct parental core of the iras source , while the other iras source is not accompanied by such a very evident condensation .",
    "figure [ fig : iimaps_iras21025 ] displays the close up view of the condensation traced by some molecular emission lines , and figure [ fig : sample_spectra ] shows spectra of various molecular lines observed toward the iras source .    as seen in figure [ fig : iimaps_iras21025 ] , the condensation is evident especially in hc@xmath25n , ccs , and nh@xmath25 .",
    "ratio of the nh@xmath98 and @xmath99 emission lines infers the gas temperature of the condensation of @xmath100 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is close to the excitation temperature @xmath101 k derived from the @xmath20co emission line .",
    "as shown in section [ subset : filaments ] , we estimate the total mass , radius , and mean molecule density of the condensation to be @xmath102 @xmath1 , @xmath103 pc , and @xmath104 @xmath105 ( see no.1 in table [ tab : filaments ] ) , respectively , based on the c@xmath4o data in the same way as described in section [ sec : distributions ] .",
    "note that the condensation is accompanied by iras 21025 + 5221 and many other faint ysos selected from the wise psc , indicating that the condensation is probably a young dense core that has just initiated to form a star cluster .",
    "the idea that the condensation is very young can be supported also by the ccs and hc@xmath25n data .",
    "it is known that these molecules are abundant in an early stage of chemical evolution of dense cores ( @xmath106 yr ) , and they rapidly disappear along with the core evolution ( @xmath107 yr , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the ccs and hc@xmath25n spectra shown in figure [ fig : sample_spectra ] , we calculated the fractional abundances of these molecules , i.e. , @xmath108 where @xmath109ccs or hc@xmath25n , using the same method as ( * ? ? ? *",
    "see their section 3.2 ) , and we found @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we compare the results with those measured in dense cores in other star forming regions as well as with a model calculation performed by @xcite in figure [ fig : abundances ] which is quoted from figure 9 of @xcite who studied starless cores in the polaris cirrus ( see their table 9 for data points of the other cores ) .",
    "there is an apparent tendency in the figure that data points for dense cores not associated with ysos ( represented by the open circles ) are located in the upper - right side of the diagram having higher @xmath112 and @xmath113 , while those associated with ysos ( filled circles ) are more widely distributed in rather bottom - left side .",
    "it is interesting to note that the condensation associated with iras 21025 + 5221 ( the open square labeled l1004e ) is located between the two distributions , suggesting that the condensation is a young core which has just started star formation .",
    "finally , we should note that there are some noticeable features in a series of spectra shown in figure [ fig : sample_spectra ] .",
    "most of the spectra have a peak radial velocity of @xmath114 km s@xmath13 which should represent the systemic velocity of gas around iras 21025 + 5221 .",
    "however , the hco@xmath115 and cs emission lines exhibit a double - peaked profile with a greater blue - shifted velocity component .",
    "such a profile is often seen around protostars in optically thick emission lines like hco@xmath115 , and is considered as a sign of collapsing motion of dense cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also noteworthy that the @xmath20co emission exhibits a very broad line width extending over the velocity range @xmath116 km s@xmath13 .",
    "this could be due to a molecular outflow possibly associated with iras 21025 + 5221 , although it is difficult to confirm its red and blue shifted wings because the @xmath20co line around the iras source is heavily contaminated by the emission from the diffuse ambient gas over a wide velocity range ( especially at @xmath117 km s@xmath13 ) .",
    "the wing - like features are also seen in the spectra of hco@xmath49 and cs which should be more free from such contamination , but we have only limited data for these lines .",
    "observations of these molecular lines at a higher angular resolution using interferometers such as sma and bima would be needed to confirm and resolve the outflow as well as the collapsing motion of the condensation .",
    "as seen in the c@xmath4o total intensity map in figure [ fig : ii_maps](a ) , l1004e has an elongated morphology consisting of several filaments and core - like structures . in order to characterize the filaments",
    ", we attempted to identify the individual filaments based on the c@xmath4o data .",
    "we first tried to find a systematic way to define the filaments , but we found that it is very difficult to find a numerical definition to separate the filaments reliably .",

    "there are actually some snrs in the vicinity of the cyg ob 7 molecular cloud including hb21 that has been suggested to be interacting with the cloud .",
    "we suggest that l1004e was influenced by such an external effect ( possibly by hb21 ) to have the initial velocity gradient , which results in the formation of the colliding filaments .",

    "we derived the total mass of the observed core as summarized in the following .",
    "the method we used assumes the lte , and is a standard way to derive the total molecular mass from the c@xmath4o emission line .",
    "details of the method can be found in some literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in general , observed brightness temperature of a certain molecular line @xmath46(@xmath169 ) ( e.g. , @xmath109c@xmath4o , @xmath20co , etc . )",
    "can be expressed as @xmath208\\left [ { 1 - { { \\mathop{\\rm e}\\nolimits } ^ { - \\tau ( x ) } } } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath209 , and @xmath210 is a constant ( @xmath210=5.27 k for c@xmath4o and 5.53 k for @xmath20co ) . @xmath73 and @xmath211 are the excitation temperature and the cosmic background ( 2.7 k ) , respectively , and @xmath212 is the optical depth .",
    "we first estimated @xmath73 at each observed position by solving the above equation for @xmath46(@xmath20co ) measured at the peak velocity of the c@xmath4o spectra assuming @xmath58(@xmath20co)@xmath213 .",
    "we then derived @xmath58(c@xmath4o ) and @xmath59(c@xmath4o ) , and converted @xmath59(c@xmath4o ) to @xmath57 to estimate the total mass @xmath214 by summing up the derived @xmath57 over the observed area .",
    "the process of the derivation can be summarized in the following equations ;            where @xmath219 and @xmath57 are in units of @xmath68 , and the constant @xmath220 is @xmath221 @xmath68 k@xmath13 ( km s@xmath13)@xmath13 for the c@xmath4o@xmath21 emission line .",
    "@xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 in the last equation are the mean molecular weight taken to be 2.4 , the hydrogen mass , and the area of the pixels of the c@xmath4o map ( @xmath225 cm@xmath3 at the assumed distance 800 pc ) .",
    "summation in the right side of equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) is made for the total area observed in c@xmath4o shown in figure [ fig : ii_maps](a ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : nh2 ] ) is derived from an empirical relationship between @xmath94 and @xmath59(c@xmath4o ) @xcite as well as between @xmath94 and @xmath59(h@xmath66 ) for @xmath227 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath57 calculated using equation ( [ eq : nh2 ] ) and then @xmath214 calculated using equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) may be the minimum estimates for the true values , because c@xmath4o is known to be depleted onto dust grains in very dense cloud interior like l1004e ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while we assume the linear @xmath59(c@xmath4o)@xmath59(h@xmath60 ) conversion relation based on the results of @xcite whose measurements were done in much less dense regions .",
    "however , we shall use the simple conversion relation in equation ( [ eq : nh2 ] ) in this paper , because it is difficult at the moment to assess precisely how much the depletion of c@xmath4o is occurring in l1004e .",
