    "early - type galaxies contain a large fraction of the total stellar mass observed in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "studying the internal structure of early - type galaxies is crucial for understanding the baryonic physics that plays a key role in the formation and evolution of these objects .",
    "several studies have shown that the stars assembled in early - type galaxies are embedded in massive dark matter haloes ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the precise amount of dark matter contained in the galaxies inner regions is still under debate .",
    "+ dark matter only simulations have found indications of a universal density profile for dark matter haloes , present also in galaxies ( the so called nfw profile ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , more recent and realistic simulations that include also the physics of baryons ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , like radiative cooling and supernova and black hole feedback , have suggested that the inner profile of the dark matter component can be significantly affected by the interactions between baryonic and dark matter .",
    "+ the internal structure of nearby early - type galaxies has been for decades the object of intense dynamical analyses ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one focus of these studies is to compare stellar with dynamical mass to light ratios .",
    "the dynamical studies , e.g. @xcite , @xcite find ratios for nearby elliptical galaxies of @xmath9 4 to 10 .",
    "similar values are also found by @xcite . only in the last few years",
    "has gravitational lensing also contributed significantly to our understanding of the luminous and dark matter composition of early - type galaxies beyond the local universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "strong gravitational lensing in early - type galaxies has also proved to be a powerful cosmological tool to probe the geometry of the universe independently from other diagnostics ( e.g. , @xcite ; ) . + by combining strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics in a sample of first 15 , then 58 early - type galaxies ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found that the average total ( luminous and dark ) mass density distribution within the effective radius  the radius of the isophote containing half of the total light of the galaxy  is well represented by an isothermal distribution ( @xmath10 ) , although significant deviations from this result can be observed in individual galaxies .",
    "only rare systems where an extended or several distinct sources are gravitationally lensed over an extended radial area on the lens plane can be used to determine the total mass density profile of the lens galaxy over a wide radial range through lensing only ( e.g. ; @xcite ) . moreover , combining lensing total mass measurements with photometric stellar mass estimates in these systems offers a unique way to disentangle their luminous and dark matter components .",
    "+ in this paper , we study the gravitational lensing system sdss j1430 + 4105 that is composed of a massive early - type galaxy acting as a lens for an irregular background source .",
    "this galaxy was part of the slacs survey and has been studied as part of their lens sample , especially in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite : @xcite fit a singular isothermal lens model to the observed multiple images , while @xcite and @xcite combine the measured einstein radii and masses with photometric and dynamical data .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of the lensed source shows several peaks that extend from 4 to 10 kpc from the lens galaxy centre .",
    "this fact provides the opportunity to investigate the lens galaxy mass distribution on radial ranges larger than those explored in similar analyses of other gravitational lensing systems ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "+ the paper is organised as follows : section 2 gives an overview of the observations and data used in this work and introduces the environment of sdssj 1430 + 4105 ; section 3 describes the details of the strong lensing models .",
    "section 4 states the implications for the total mass and the mass profile . in section 5 the mass to light ratio for the de vaucouleurs component",

    "the slacs survey aimed at finding strong gravitational lenses among the galaxies observed in the sdss .",
    "the lens detection strategy is presented in @xcite and is based on the examination of the sdss galaxy spectra , taken with a 3 diameter fibre , to identify emission lines not associated with the primary target galaxy but with an additional source , aligned with the first galaxy and located at a higher redshift .",
    "the lens candidates are then ranked in terms of their probability of being lensing systems and are consequently observed with the hst / acs and wfpc2 .    up to now , 85 confirmed ( grade - a ) lenses ( @xcite , @xcite ) were discovered in this way , and sdssj 1430 + 4105 is one of these . in fig .",

    "for the lensing analysis we use the acs f814w filter observations , since the psf of the acs camera is smaller than the one of the wfpc2 and wfc3 .",
    "first , we subtract the lensing galaxy s light contribution with galfit ( @xcite ) by using a de vaucouleurs profile , with the parameters of table [ observations : table : slacs_values ] .",

    "we describe the galaxies as singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) without truncation of their mass profiles and obtain at the position of the lens :      in this model , the shear and surface density at the location of the lens depends on the 2-dimensional galaxy distribution and not at all on the centre of mass of the group .",
    "the galaxies themselves are parametrized only by their positions and velocity dispersions @xmath29 .",
    "the value of the velocity dispersion @xmath30 for sdss j1430 + 4105 is taken from the central velocity dispersion measured by the sdss .",
    "the estimates @xmath29 for the neighbouring galaxies are obtained from the faber - jackson relation ( @xcite ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the sdss @xmath32 band flux of the neighbours and @xmath33 the flux of the lens galaxy a. the shear @xmath34 and convergence @xmath35 for a sis at a projected angular distance @xmath36 from its centre are @xmath37 with @xmath38 denoting the speed of light and @xmath39 and @xmath40 mark the angular diameter distances from the lens to the source and from the observer to the source , respectively .",
    "the proper ( vector ) addition of these convergence and shear values yields a prediction of @xmath41 the angle of the shear is @xmath42 in the local coordinate system . the fact that we model the galaxies as siss , ignoring the finite halo sizes which would keep the mass associated to galaxies limited , is not relevant , since finite halo sizes can only lead to lower estimates for the convergence and shear at the position of galaxy a. therefore , we get an upper limit of the clumpy group estimates using this assumption . as we see in sec .",
    "[ sec : lens modelling of the environment ] , the parameters of the lensing galaxy only mildly depend on the assumptions about the group as long as it is centred on galaxy i. to calculate the mass of this clumpy group , we first need the @xmath43 .",
    "we adopt the definition of @xcite of @xmath43 as a function of number of group members .",
    "we sum up all mass contributions of member galaxies in table [ table : observations : environment : galaxies ] within this @xmath44 centred on a or i , respectively and calculate the total projected mass of the group within its @xmath43 : @xmath45 .",
    "this value gives an upper limit of the mass associated with the group , since sis profiles for its members overestimate the densities of each member at large radii .      in principle",
    ", the assumption of the group being located at a could already be in conflict with the lensing observables .",
    "the most secure strong lensing estimate is the observed critical mass @xmath46 within the einstein radius , obtained from all models in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] consistently .",
    "we now can model the group  located at a as an nfw or sis ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : parametric models : point like ] for details ) profile and estimate its projected mass within the observed einstein radius .",
    "if this halo mass estimate exceeds the observed critical mass , the assumption of this group being a typical group with 12 members and with galaxy a as its centre is already in conflict with the lensing observables .",
    "[ sdssj1430_group_mass_limits ] we show the c-@xmath47 diagram for a nfw profile .",
    "the levels of grey indicate the virial @xmath48 mass of a group with parameter values c and @xmath47 .",
    "the thick solid line marks the transition where the nfw group halo mass within the observed einstein radius alone ( without baryons and dark matter of the galaxy a ) exceeds the critical mass , predicting a bigger than the observed einstein radius .",
    "therefore all groups that lie above this line would  from its group halo mass alone  overpredict the observed total projected mass within the einstein radius and can not be centred at galaxy a. + in reality , some of the observed mass within the einstein radius has to be contributed by the stars , giving an even smaller upper limit for the dark matter mass within the einstein radius .",

    "@xcite fit composite stellar population models to the sdss photometry of this galaxy to derive its stellar mass within the observed einstein radius .",
    "we use the salpeter imf stellar masses of @xcite , since these give the highest mass in stars .",

    "all group haloes above this dash - dotted line in this c-@xmath47 plane overpredict the observed total mass within the einstein radius , therefore this lines mark regions with excluded group haloes . since the typical @xcite group halo lies below this lines , the observed critical mass within the einstein radius does not exclude a as the group centre .",
    "the thick , solid 1.00 line marks the transition where the dark matter group halo alone would provide the observed critical mass within the einstein radius .",
