    "comparison of cc chemo - cosmological models with observed dla abundances further shows that the weak redshift evolution of dla abundances is a natural result of the long sf timescales for disks galaxies , and the range of sf timescales @xmath30 for spirals from sa through sd fully explains the abundance scatter among dlas at any redshift .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , abundances of elements which locally are known to strongly deplete onto dust grains ( like fe or cr ) are as well described by our models as are non - refractory elements like zn .",

    "* at low redshift , the gas poor early type spirals seem to drop out of dla samples*. while a deficiency of high n(hi ) systems at low z has been noted before ( lanzetta _ et al .",

    "if this were confirmed by further low - z dla data , it would have serious implications as to the posibility to optically identify dla galaxies .",
    "locally , on average , sd galaxies are fainter by @xmath72 mag in b than sa s and our cc spectro - cosmological models predict that the low - z dla galaxies should be about as faint in b , @xmath73 , and k as the brightest members of the high - z population : @xmath74 , @xmath73@xmath75 , k @xmath76 mag . luminosities of the few optically identified dla galaxies ( and candidates ) to date are in good agreement with our predictions ( cf .",

    "optically identified dla absorbers with information about ism abundances from the metal absorption lines * and * spectrophotometric properties of the stellar population allow to much better constrain the model parameters than either aspect ( ism or stars ) alone ( cf .",
    "et al .  _",
    "since dla galaxies are within the reach of 10m - class telescopes up to redshifts z @xmath77 and trace the normal galaxy population to these high redshifts without any bias as to high luminosity , radio power , or the like , they can give powerful constraints on the evolutionary histories and ages , and , ultimately , even on the cosmological parameters .",
    "accurate abundance data in very low metallicity dlas may provide valuable clues for the nucleosynthesis at low metallicity .",
    "i pointed out the importance of a chemically consistent modelling of the spectrophotometric and chemical evolution of galaxies that takes into account the evolving metallicity distribution of the stellar population .",
