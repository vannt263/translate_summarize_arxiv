    "although there is a long tradition of scholarship on networks , the last two decades have witnessed substantial advances in network science due to developments in physics , mathematics , computer science , sociology , and numerous other disciplines @xcite .",
    "given that the questions asked by researchers in different fields can be surprisingly similar , it would be useful to be able to highlight similarities in network structures across disciplines in a systematic way .",
    "one way to approach this is to formulate a suitable means of comparing networks and to use this means to develop taxonomies of networks .",
    "such taxonomies have the potential to facilitate the identification of problems from different disciplines that might be approached similarly in terms of both empirical analyses and theoretical modeling .",
    "for example , if a biological network depicting covariation of neural activity in different regions of the brain is demonstrated to be structurally similar to a financial network representing correlations of stock returns , then certain types of edge thresholding methods or structural null models might be applicable to both situations .    from a historical perspective , classification of objects",
    "has often been central to the progress of science , as demonstrated by the periodic table of elements in chemistry and phylogenetic trees of organisms in biology @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that an organization of networks has the potential to shed light on mechanisms for generating networks , reveal how an unknown network should be treated once one has discerned its position in a taxonomy , or help identify a network family s anomalous members .",
    "further potential applications of network taxonomies include unsupervised study of multiple realizations of a given model process ( e.g. , characterizing the similarities and differences of many different networks drawn from the erds - rnyi random graph model using the same parameter values ) , examination of multiple empirical networks with known similar origins or generative processes , and the detection of anomalous changes in temporally ordered series of networks . in this paper , we develop a framework for the creation of network taxonomies . in so doing , we develop the requisite diagnostic tools and discuss several case studies that suggest how our methodology can help illuminate relationships both between and within families of networks .    in aiming to construct taxonomies of networks ,",
    "one has to consider the scales at which one wants to compare differences in network structures .",
    "much research has focused on extremes  either microscopic ( e.g. , node degree ) or macroscopic ( e.g. , mean geodesic distance ) properties  and numerous researchers have , for example , reported that many empirical networks possess heavy - tailed degree distributions or the small - world property @xcite . given the ubiquity of such findings , it is clear that more nuanced approaches are needed to make useful comparisons between networks .",
    "indeed , interpretations of microscopic and macroscopic approaches often implicitly assume that networks are homogeneous and ignore `` mesoscopic '' structures in networks . to overcome some of these limitations , earlier work has focused on the statistics of small , _ a priori _ specified modules called `` motifs '' @xcite , role - to - role connectivity profiles of nodes @xcite , the isolation of statistically significant structures called `` backbones '' @xcite , interrelations of network modules @xcite , examination of the number of nodes located within `` shells '' @xcite , and the self - similarity of networks as characterized by fractal exponents @xcite .",
    "the taxonomic framework that we develop in the present paper builds on the idea of examining network modules by computing community structures @xcite , as was also done in the work of @xcite , and we subsequently compare signatures derived from community structure across networks . importantly , although we use a specific method to uncover network communities , much of the introduced framework is independent of that choice . consequently , our comparative framework can accommodate a large variety of community detection schemes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we discuss the detection of communities in networks in order to find coherent groups of nodes that are densely connected to each other .",
    "we then introduce _ mesoscopic response functions _ ( mrfs ) , which allow us to probe how the community structure of a network changes as a function of a resolution parameter that determines network scales of interest .",
    "we then illustrate mrfs using several examples of networks and compare the mrfs for several well - known generative models of networks .",
    "we use mrfs to develop a means to measure distance between a pair of networks , and use this comparative measure to cluster networks and thereby develop taxonomies . using 746 networks from numerous different fields ,",
    "we construct a taxonomy of these networks .",
    "we then construct taxonomies of networks within fields using several case studies : voting in the united states senate , voting in the united nations general assembly , facebook networks at us universities , fungal networks , and networks of stock returns in the new york stock exchange . in each example",
    ", we expose structure that is either illuminating or can be checked against information from an external source ( e.g. , previously published investigations ) .",
    "this suggests that our method for comparing networks is capturing important similarities and differences .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in addition , we provide further details in the appendices and supplemental material . among other topics ,",
    "we examine the robustness of the obtained taxonomies , address some computational issues , tabulate some of the basic properties of the networks that we investigated , and provide references for the network data sources used in this study .",
    "our approach is based on network _ community structure _ @xcite .",
    "a community consists of a set of nodes for which there are more edges ( or , in the case of weighted networks , a greater total edge weight ) connecting the nodes in the set than what would be expected by chance .",
    "the algorithmic detection of communities is a particularly active area of network science , in part because communities are thought to be related to functional units in many networks and in part because they can strongly influence dynamical processes that operate on networks @xcite .    in this paper , we detect communities using the multi - resolution potts method @xcite , a generalization of modularity optimization @xcite .",
    "( modularity optimization is perhaps the most popular approach for detecting communities . ) given a network adjacency matrix @xmath0 , we find communities by minimizing the hamiltonian of the infinite - range @xmath1-state potts spin glass @xmath2 where @xmath3 indicates the community ( state ) of node ( spin ) @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a resolution parameter , and @xmath6 is the coupling matrix with entries @xmath7 representing the interaction strength between node @xmath4 and node @xmath8 in the potts hamiltonian .",
    "we use the ( undirected - network ) null model @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the strength ( total edge weight ) of node @xmath4 and @xmath11 is the total edge weight in the network @xcite . by tuning the resolution parameter @xmath5",
    ", we can detect communities at multiple scales of a network .",
    "our particular choice of @xmath12 implies that we are optimizing modularity ( with the addition of the resolution parameter ) @xcite .    to compare networks , we create profiles of summary statistics that characterize the community structure of each network at different mesoscopic scales .",
    "we also study a wide variety of networks that contain different numbers of nodes and edges .",
    "( we enumerate the networks that we consider in table  ii of the supplemental material . ) to ensure that we can compare the profiles for different networks , we sweep the resolution parameter @xmath5 from a minimum value @xmath13 to a maximum value @xmath14 ( discussed in detail below ) .",
    "we define these quantities separately for each network such that the number of communities @xmath15 into which the network is partitioned is @xmath16 at @xmath13 and is equal to the total number of nodes @xmath1 at @xmath14 . in other words",
    ", one can think of @xmath5 as a parameter that controls the fragmentation of a network into communities .    to find the minimum and maximum resolution - parameter values ,",
    "consider the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : som : h ] ) .",
    "an interaction is called _ ferromagnetic _ when @xmath17 and _ antiferromagnetic _ when @xmath18 . for each pair of nodes @xmath4 and @xmath8 , we find the resolution @xmath19 at which the interaction @xmath12 is neutral ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) , leading to @xmath21 .",
    "we thereby identify two special resolutions : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is any small number ( we use @xmath24 in the present paper ) .",
    "the resolution @xmath13 is the largest @xmath25 value for which community detection yields a single community ; note that this need not be the minimum non - zero value of @xmath25 . including the small number @xmath26 in the definition of @xmath14 ensures that all edges are antiferromagnetic at resolution @xmath27 and thereby forces each node into its own community .",
    "to describe how a network disintegrates into communities as the value of @xmath5 is increased from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ karate_mrfs](a ) for a schematic ) , one needs to select summary statistics .",
    "there are many possible ways to summarize such a disintegration process , and we focus on three diagnostics that characterize fundamental properties of network communities .",
    "first , we use the value of the hamiltonian @xmath28 ( [ eq : som : h ] ) , which is a scalar quantity closely related to network modularity and quantifies the energy of the system @xcite .",
    "second , we calculate a partition entropy @xmath29 to characterize the community size distribution . to do this , let @xmath30 denote the number of nodes in community @xmath31 and define @xmath32 to be the probability to choose uniformly at random a member node of community @xmath31 .",
    "this yields a ( shannon ) partition entropy of @xmath33 , which quantifies the disorder in the associated community size distribution .",
    "third , we use the number of communities @xmath34 .    needing to normalize @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath15 to compare them effectively across networks ,",
    "we define an _ effective energy _ @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; an _ effective entropy _ @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; and an _ effective number of communities _",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "some networks contain a small number of entries @xmath25 that are orders - of - magnitude larger than most other entries . for example , in the network of facebook friendships at caltech @xcite , 98% of the @xmath25 entries are less than 100 , but 0.02% of them are larger than 8000 .",
    "these large @xmath25 values arise when two low - strength nodes become connected . using the null model @xmath9 , the interaction between two nodes @xmath4 and @xmath8 becomes antiferromagnetic",
    "when @xmath46 .",
    "if the network has a large total edge weight but both @xmath4 and @xmath8 have small strengths compared to other nodes in the network , then @xmath5 needs to be large to make the interaction antiferromagnetic . in prior studies ,",
    "network community structure has been investigated at different mesoscopic scale by considering plots of various diagnostics as a function of the resolution parameter @xcite . in the present example , such plots would be dominated by interactions that require large resolution - parameter values to become antiferromagnetic . to overcome this issue",
    ", we define the _ effective fraction of antiferromagnetic edges _ @xmath47 \\ , , \\label{eq : som : xi}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the total number of antiferromagnetic interactions for the given value of @xmath5 in the network .",
    "in other words , it is the number of @xmath25 elements that are smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath49 is the largest number of antiferromagnetic interactions for which the network still forms a single community , and the effective number of antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath50 is the number of antiferromagnetic interactions ( normalized to the unit interval ) in excess of @xmath49 .",
    "the function @xmath50 increases monotonically in @xmath5",
    ".    sweeping @xmath5 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 corresponds to sweeping the value of @xmath51 from @xmath52 to @xmath16 .",
    "( one can think of @xmath5 as a continuous variable and @xmath51 as a discrete variable that changes with events . ) as we perform such sweeping for a given network , the number of communities increases from @xmath53 to @xmath54 and yields a vector ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) whose components we call the _ mesoscopic response functions _ ( mrf ) of that network .",
    "because @xmath58 $ ] , @xmath59 $ ] , @xmath60 $ ] , and @xmath61 $ ] for every network , we can compare the mrfs across networks and use them to identify groups of networks with similar mesoscopic structures . in fig .",
    "[ karate_mrfs](b ) , we show the zachary karate club network @xcite for different values of @xmath51 .",
    "as more edges become antiferromagnetic , the network fragments into smaller communities , and panel ( c ) shows the corresponding mrfs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cube ] , we show a schematic of the mrf in which we emphasize its interpretation as a 3-dimensional vector . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrf_eg ] , we show example mrfs for several other networks .    although minimizing eq .  ( [ eq : som : h ] ) is an np - hard problem @xcite and @xmath62 possesses a complicated landscape of local optima for many networks @xcite , there exist numerous good computational heuristics that make finding a nearly - optimal partition of the network into communities at a given resolution computationally tractable @xcite . thus far ,",
    "we have reported results that were obtained by optimizing modularity using the locally greedy louvain algorithm @xcite because its speed was important for studying large networks .",
    "we have compared the results that we report in the present work to those obtained from optimizing modularity using spectral and simulated - annealing algorithms , and obtained similar mrfs and taxonomies for them ( see appendix  [ sec : heuristics]2 for more details ) .",
    "the shapes of the mrfs summarize many factors  including the fraction of possible edges in a network that are actually present , the relative weights of inter- versus intra - community edges , the edge weights compared with the expected edge weights in the null model , the number of edges that need to become antiferromagnetic for a community to fragment , and the way in which the communities fragment ( e.g. , whether a community splits in half or a single node leaves a community when a particular edge becomes antiferromagnetic ) . to understand the effects of some of these factors on the shapes of the mrfs",
    ", we consider some examples .    of particular interest are plateaus in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 curves that are accompanied by large increases in @xmath65 .",
    "as illustrated in panel [ fig : mrf_eg](a ) , the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) network from 1980 to 1999 @xcite provides a good example of this behavior .",
    "this network is an instance from the category of _ similarity networks_. we use this label to describe networks that have been constructed by starting from some node - level quantity or attribute and then defining the edges based on some form of similarity or correlation measure between each pair of nodes .",
    "similarity networks tend to be complete ( or almost complete ) and weighted networks , except when they have been deliberately thresholded . in this particular example",
    ", each node represents a stock , and the strength of the edge connecting stocks @xmath4 and @xmath8 is linear in the pearson correlation between the daily logarithmic returns of the stocks .",
    "( see section  [ subsec : nyse ] for more details . )",
    "plateaus imply that as the resolution @xmath5 is increased ( leading to an increase in @xmath65 ) , the communities remain unchanged even though the number and strength of antiferromagnetic interactions increase . as @xmath5 is increased and more interactions become antiferromagnetic , there is an increased energy incentive for communities to break up .",
    "community partitions in such plateaus tend to be robust and have the potential to represent interesting structures @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrf_eg](b ) , we show mrfs for a  fractal \" network @xcite , which demonstrates that plateaus in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 curves need not be accompanied by significant changes in @xmath65 .",
    "such plateaus can be explained by considering the distribution of @xmath25 values .",
    "if several interactions have identical values of @xmath25 , then the interactions all become antiferromagnetic at exactly the same resolution value .",
    "this leads to a significant increase in the effective fraction of antiferromagnetic edges @xmath51 but only a small change in @xmath65 .",
    "if these interactions do not result in additional communities , then we obtain plateaus in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 curves .",
    "to demonstrate qualitatively different behavior , we show the mrfs for the biogrid _ drosophila melanogaster _ network and the garfield scientometrics citation network in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrf_eg](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : mrf_eg](d ) , respectively .",
    "a common feature in these mrfs is the sharp initial increase in the curves that results from the networks initially breaking into two communities .",
    "another family of networks , which we will discuss in more detail in our case studies , are political voting networks .",
    "these voting networks are also similarity networks : we have constructed these networks so that an edge between two nodes indicates the level of agreement on votes between two entities , and each edge takes a value between @xmath52 and @xmath16 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrf_eg](e ) , we show the mrfs for the voting network of the united kingdom house of commons during the period 20012005 @xcite ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrf_eg](f ) , we show the mrfs for the roll - call voting network for the @xmath66 ( 20032004 ) united states house of representatives @xcite . in both cases , we observe that sharp increases in @xmath65 can be accompanied by only small changes in @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "to see how this can arise , we again consider the distribution of @xmath25 values .",
    "if the @xmath25 distribution is multi - modal , there can be a large difference between consecutive @xmath25 values .",
    "a large increase in @xmath5 is then needed to increase @xmath51 , which in turn results in a large change in @xmath65 . however , the change in @xmath63 is small because this only results in a single additional antiferromagnetic interaction .",

    "to provide further insights into mrfs , we consider erds - rnyi ( er ) @xcite , barabsi - albert ( ba ) @xcite , and watts - strogatz ( ws ) @xcite networks .",
    "these network models are stochastic , and there is a large ensemble of possible network realizations for each choice of parameter values in these models .",
    "however , even with the ensuing structural variation , networks generated by a given one of these three models exhibit similar properties at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales , so we expect mrfs for different realizations of a given model to be similar . in fig .  [",
    "fig : model_mrfs ] , we compare the mrfs for 1000 realizations of each model for networks with @xmath67 nodes and mean degree @xmath68 . for the ws networks , we set the edge rewiring probability at @xmath69 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_mrfs ] , we obtain a narrow range of possible mrfs for fixed parameter values .",
    "this comparison illustrates that the mrf profiles of the three different models are distinctive .",
    "in addition , for each model there is little variation in the behavior of the mrfs across different network realizations with the same parameter values .",
    "nodes and mean degree @xmath68 . for each value of @xmath51 ,",
    "the upper curves show the maximum values of @xmath65 ( top row ) , @xmath64 ( middle row ) , and @xmath63 ( bottom row ) for all networks in the ensemble ; the lower curves show the corresponding minimum value , and the dashed curves show the corresponding mean . ]",
    "it is also instructive to consider variation in mrf shapes for a particular network model for different parameter values .",
    "we focus on ws networks because they illuminate the effect of the distribution of @xmath25 values on the shapes of the mrfs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ws_comp ] , we show mrfs for ws networks for different values of the edge rewiring probability @xmath70 .",
    "( we continue using @xmath67 and @xmath68 . )",
    "we also show the distribution of @xmath25 values for each network .    for small rewiring probabilities ,",
    "the mrfs have lots of steps . as with prior examples ,",
    "we can see how this feature arises by considering the distribution of @xmath25 values .",
    "when the rewiring probability is small , many nodes possess the same degree , which results in the presence of many interactions with identical @xmath25 values ( see the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ws_comp ] ) . because several interactions have identical @xmath25 values , these interactions all become antiferromagnetic at exactly the same resolution - parameter value , so the behavior of mrfs only changes for a small number of @xmath51 values . as the rewiring probability @xmath70 is increased , the degree and @xmath25 distributions become more heterogeneous , which leads to smoother mrfs . for a rewiring probability of @xmath71 ,",
    "the ws network is just an er network .    .",
    "each network has @xmath67 nodes and mean degree @xmath68 .",
    "lower panels : distributions of @xmath25 values for each network . as expected ,",
    "the mrfs for @xmath71 are identical to those of an erds - rnyi network with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . ]",
    "in the framework that we have introduced in this paper , comparing two networks at the mesoscopic level amounts to characterizing the differences in behavior of the corresponding mrfs . to quantify such differences ,",
    "we define a distance between two networks with respect to one of the summary statistics as the area between the corresponding mrfs . for example",
    ", the distance between two networks @xmath4 and @xmath8 with respect to the effective energy @xmath65 is given by @xmath72 for the effective entropy and effective number of communities , the distances are given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "we represent the resulting three sets of distances ( computed for each pair of networks from the 746 networks that we consider , see table i ) in matrix form as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "these distance measures have several desirable properties .",
    "first , they compare mrfs across all network scales ( i.e. , for all values of @xmath51 ) ; second , each distance is bounded between @xmath52 and @xmath16 ; third , the distances are easy to interpret , as each of them corresponds to the geometric area between ( a certain dimension of ) a pair of mrfs ; and finally , we find _ a posteriori _ that these distances can be used to cluster networks accurately ( see the discussions below ) .",
    "we have computed mrfs for the energy @xmath62 , entropy @xmath36 , and number of communities @xmath15 , but we can proceed similarly with any desired summary statistic . if two diagnostics provide similar information , then one of them can be excluded without significant loss of information .",
    "we checked whether the summary statistics were sufficiently different , for the set of networks considered here , for it to be worthwhile to include all of them by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient between their corresponding distance measures .",
    "the correlations between the pairs of distances are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "these correlations are not sufficiently high to justify excluding any of the summary statistics .    in the interest of parsimony  and given the non - vanishing correlations between the distance measures  we reduce the number of distance measures using principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite .",
    "starting with @xmath81 networks , we create a @xmath82 matrix in which each column corresponds to the vector representation of the upper triangle of one of the distance matrices @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77 , and we perform a pca on this matrix . we then define a distance matrix @xmath83 with elements @xmath84 , where the weights are the coefficients for the first principal component , and we normalize the sum of squared coefficients to unity .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the first component accounts for about 69% of the variance , so the distances @xmath83 provide a reasonable single - variable projection of the distances @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "it is important that the distance measures for comparing networks are robust to small perturbations in network structure .",
    "because many of the networks that we study are constructed empirically , they might contain false positives and false negatives .",
    "in other words , the networks might falsely identify a relationship where none exists , and they also might fail to identify an existing relationship . consequently , the topology and edge weights of an observed network might be slightly different than those of the actual underlying network . to test the robustness of our distance measures to such observational errors ,",
    "we recalculate the mrfs for a subset of relatively small unweighted networks in which , for each network , we rewire a number of edges corresponding to a given percentage of the total number of edges ( 5% , 10% , 20% , 50% , or 100% )",
    ". see appendix  [ sec : robust ] for more details .",
    "( we study networks with up to 1000 nodes and only consider a subset of 25 networks because of the computational costs of rewiring a large number of networks multiple times ; however , we have performed the same investigation for 5 different subsets of 25 networks and obtained similar results .",
    "we list the networks in each subset in table  i of the supplemental material . )",
    "we investigate two rewiring mechanisms : one in which the degree distribution is maintained , where we also ensure after each rewiring that the network forms a single connected component ; and another in which the only constraint is that the network continues to consist of a single connected component after each edge rewiring @xcite .",
    "we find in both cases that the structures of the block - diagonalized distance matrices for the 25 networks ( see figs.[fig : rewiring_percentage ] and [ fig : full_rewiring_comp ] in appendix [ sec : robust ] ) are robust to random perturbations of the networks , thereby suggesting that our mrf distance measures are not sensitive to small structural perturbations .",
    "we assign each of the 746 networks to a category based on its type ( see table  [ tbl : category ] ) . due to the varying availability of different types of network data , the included networks are not evenly distributed across these categories .",
    "many of the networks are either different temporal snapshots of the same system or different realizations of the same type of network . to have a more balanced distribution across the different categories , we focus on 189 of the 746 networks .",
    "we only include categories for which we have 8 or more networks , and we selected a subset of networks ( uniformly at random ) from the larger categories .",
    "we also exclude all synthetic networks .",
    "see section iv of the supplemental material for the list of networks that we consider and fig .  1 in section ii of the supplemental material for a dendrogram showing a taxonomy we constructed using all 746 networks .",
    "our primary reason for assigning each network to a category is to use such an external categorization to help assess the quality of taxonomies produced by the unsupervised mrf clustering . for each way of computing distance",
    ", we construct a dendrogram for the set of networks using average linkage clustering , which is an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique @xcite to compare how well each algorithm preserves the pairwise distances between the networks @xcite .",
    "we obtain the following cophenetic correlations for the different linkage clustering algorithms : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "hence , dendrograms constructed using average linkage clustering preserve the distances in @xmath83 better than those constructed using the other two clustering techniques .",
    "we thus use average linkage clustering to construct all of the dendrograms in this paper . ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dendrogram_dp ] , we show a dendrogram obtained from the distance matrix @xmath83 .",
    "the colored rectangle underneath each leaf indicates the network category .",
    "contiguous blocks of color demonstrate that networks from the same category have been grouped together using the mrf clustering method , and the presence of such contiguous color blocks is an indication of the success of the mrf clustering scheme .",
    "the assignment of the networks to one of these categories is of course to some extent subjective , as several of the networks could belong to more than one category .",
    "for example , we could categorize the network of jazz musicians @xcite as either a collaboration network or a social network .",
    "the initial selection of network categories is also somewhat subjective .",
    "one could argue that if one has a social network category , then it is not necessary to have a collaboration network category as well because a collaboration network is a type of social network .",
    "we have attempted to maintain a balance between having too many categories and having too few of them .",
