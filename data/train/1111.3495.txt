    "light elements are important tracers of stellar internal mixing and rotation .",
    "since they are burned at relatively low temperatures they constrain how the material inside stars is mixed with the hotter interior .",
    "rotation and angular momentum loss are among the leading processes to explain the mixing that leads to depletion of light elements in solar - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although gravitational waves may also affect the abundances of those elements @xcite . however , available models for evolution of be ( considering rotation ) do not predict a significant depletion of be during the main sequence for stars with 6000 k @xmath2 t@xmath0 @xmath2 4000 k @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "models which take into account gravitational waves predict significant be depletion only for stars cooler than 4500 k @xcite .",
    "+ in a recent work , @xcite confirmed that li was severely depleted in solar - type stars ( with t@xmath0 between 5600 k and 5850 k ) with planets when compared with similar stars without detected planets although this result is controversial @xcite ; for a complete discussion see @xcite .",
    "this difference in li abundance seems to be related to the different rotational history of both groups of stars due to the presence of protoplanetary disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , beryllium needs a greater temperature to be burned so we would expect to see the onset of this effect in cooler stars where convective envelopes are deep enough to reach those higher temperatures . + in a previous paper , @xcite found two cool planet host stars with an extra depletion of be when compared with analog stars without detected planets .",
    "this encourages us to try to investigate this process in cool stars . in this work",
    "we continue that analysis by extending the sample with 15 new cool stars .",
    "we refer the reader to that paper for further information and a more extensive introduction .",
    "in this study we obtained high resolution spectra for 15 new stars with magnitudes v between 6 and 10 using the uves spectrograph at the 8.2-m kueyen vlt ( ut2 ) telescope ( run i d 86.d-0082a ) between october 2010 and march 2011 .",
    "the dichroic mirror was used to obtain also red spectra and the slit width was 0.5 arcsec .",
    "these new spectra have a spectral resolution _ r _",
    "@xmath3 70000 and _ s / n _ ratios between 100 and 200 . all the data were reduced with the pipeline of _ uves / vlt_. standard background correction , flat - field and extraction procedures were used .",
    "the wavelength calibration was made using a thar lamp spectrum taken during the same night .",
    "finally we manually normalized the continuum by dividing the spectra by a spline function with three pieces ( and the parameter @xmath4 set to 1 ) in the whole blue region ( 3040-3800 ) .",
    "this normalization does not present any bias for stars with and without planets . when plotting together observed spectra of stars with and without planets we only had to multiply the flux of comparison stars by 0.9 - 1.1 in order to make them match up .",
    "we note that in our previous works we have analyzed high metallicity ( up to 0.4 ) solar type stars with teff down to 5300 k for which we could make a good normalization .",
    "the main problem is the normalization of spectra of stars with teff less than @xmath3 5300 k. these stars could have spots and inhomogeneous atmospheres that make the spectral synthesis more difficult .",
    "+ the uniform stellar atmospheric parameters were taken from @xcite with typical errors of 25 k for @xmath5 , 0.04 dex for @xmath6 , 0.03 km s@xmath7 for @xmath8 and 0.02 dex for metallicity .",
    "we refer to that work for further details in these parameters and their uncertainties .",
    "+ be abundances were derived by fitting the spectral region around the line at 3131.06  and then using the line 3130.42  to check the consistency of the fit .",
    "we used an empirical line list from @xcite tuned to reproduce the solar spectrum ( see table [ lista ] ) .",
    "these synthetic spectra were convolved with a rotational profile .",
    "we made a standard lte analysis with the revised version of the spectral synthesis code moog2002 @xcite and a grid of kurucz atlas9 atmospheres with overshooting @xcite .",
    "examples of synthetic spectra and the parameters used in the synthesis are shown in figure [ ajustes_be ] .",
    "+ the final sample is composed of 70 and 30 stars with and without planets , respectively , from @xcite , 14 stars with planets from @xcite and 5 and 10 stars with and without detected planets , respectively , from this work .",
    "this gives a total sample of 89 stars with planets and 40 comparison sample stars .",
    "all be abundances for these 89 + 40 stars were analyzed by our team using the same methodology , making this a very uniform sample .",

    "@xcite used an artificial fe line at 3131.043 which in our case does not help to fit the spectrum ( purple dashed - three pointed line ) since this line gets stronger in metallic stars .",

    "however , it is imposible to fit the spectra using high be abundances so we can put an upper limit in be content though we can not calculate accurate abundances .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of be line does not seem to be related to t@xmath0 since some cool young objets present strong be lines with abundances similar to solar @xcite .",
