    "the features exhibited in the present analysis is a common feature in susy models with low energy flavor and cp violating squark mixings . a model with mixing only between second and third generation down type squarks",
    "can easily evade known low energy constraints but give dramatic signals in @xmath241 transitions .",
    "our purpose has been to illustrate such efficacy and hopefully motivate our experimental colleagues for detailed studies .",
    "we find that direct cp violating rate asymmetries can be as large as 10% , comparable to general multi - higgs doublet models@xcite .",
    "purely ll mixing is favored in this case .",
    "even more interesting would be the observation of mixing induced cp violation . here , purely ll or rr mixing is insufficient , but ll and rr mixing or lr mixing models could lead to rather sizable effects .",
    "the observation of mixing induced cp violation immediately demonstrates that @xmath10 decay has two chiralities .",
    "independent of cp violation , however , the chirality structure can be tested by studying @xmath5 polarization in @xmath242 decay .",
    "the parameter @xmath233 can deviate from the sm value of 1 .",
    "the nonobservance of cp violation in @xmath18 meson decays does not preclude surprises in the @xmath152 measurement .",
