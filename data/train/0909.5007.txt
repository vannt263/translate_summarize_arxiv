    "in their study of multiple - access collision channel without feedback , massey and mathys show that the capacity region can be achieved by deterministic channel access method  @xcite .",
    "it contrasts with the more traditional multiple - access scheme like pure aloha or slotted aloha@xcite , where transmission times of packets form a random process . in this paper , we extend the transmission scheme by massey and mathys to tandem network , in which nodes are located on a straight line .",
    "nodes that are more than two hops away do not interfere with each other .",
    "if a node receives two packets that overlap in time , either partially or completely , both packets are assumed erased and unrecoverable .",
    "this model is applicable to wireless sensor network along a highway or river for instance .",
    "since antenna system that transmits and receives at the same time is often too costly to implement , we assume that each node operates in half - duplex mode ; when a node is not transmitting , it listens to its two neighboring nodes .    in our proposed transmission scheme ,",
    "the transmission times of packets of each node follow a pre - assigned deterministic and periodic pattern .",
    "implementation of this kind of deterministic channel accessing scheme is particularly easy . we can simply store the whole pattern of transmission times in memory , read it out repeatedly , and send out packets accordingly . no coordination between nodes and no centralized packet scheduling",
    "is needed .",
    "network operations are thus fully distributed .",
    "this feature is especially suitable for low - complexity wireless sensor network .",
    "related work on tandem network can be found in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider one source node and one destination node , that are connected by a series of intermediate relay nodes in tandem , and model each hop as an erasure channel . a coding scheme which can approach the min - cut bound  @xcite is proposed .",

    "half - duplex wireless network is investigated , and the effect of random multiple - access on network coding  @xcite is addressed . in this paper , we devise a transmission scheme that combines multiple - access protocol , erasure - correction coding and network coding efficiently .",
    "we will show that this cross - layer design can achieve the ( zero - error ) capacity region of bi - directional tandem collision network , and is thus optimal .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "a transmission scheme that incorporates multiple - access , erasure correction and network coding for slot - synchronous system is presented in sections  [ sec : achievable ] .",

    "the achievable rate region by the network - coded slotted aloha scheme is _ identical _ to the capacity region defined by   and  .",

    "we can also observe that all rate regions are not convex .",

    "the main functionality difference between the network - coded slotted aloha scheme and the capacity - achieving scheme is that there is no channel coding in the network - coded slotted aloha scheme .",
    "thus , we see that nested coding is essential in improving throughput .",
    "in this paper we present a transmission scheme for tandem collision network .",
    "the construction involves three different ideas : shift - invariant protocol sequences for multiple - access , nested coding for erasure correction , and network coding for bi - directional information flow .",
    "the resulting transmission system does not require any coordination or synchronization among the nodes , and yet is able to achieve optimal throughput in bi - directional tandem collision network . for wireless sensor networks , achieving time synchronization",

    "the proposed scheme can alleviate this problem and operate slot - asynchronously .",
    "numerical examples show that the protocol - signal approach can achieve higher data rate than random - access transmission schemes .",
