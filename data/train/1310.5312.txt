    "various artificial materials such as metamaterials @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite , and waveguide arrays @xcite are considered as promising structures to manipulate light effectively .",
    "it is their spatial periodicity that connects these artificial materials and conventional crystals ( metal , semiconductors , dielectrics ) .",
    "for this reason , the bloch functions inherent in the schrdinger equation with a periodic potential should be typical for the solutions of the maxwell equations with the periodical dependence of the refractive index .",
    "hence , many physical effects inherent in solid state physics should have their optical counterparts @xcite .    for the schrdinger equation ,",
    "the electron bloch functions describe the propagating state .",
    "it is known that a superimposition of a disorder or an external electrical field may result in the spatial localization of an electron in solids . in the first case , the electron experiences either anderson localization or dynamic localization . in the second case ,",
    "an electron experiences the bloch oscillations and zener tunneling . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the optical analog of the electron bloch oscillations .    in the standard",
    "the first principle solid state physics the description of the phenomena is based on the analysis of the corresponding schrdinger equation . within the quasi - classical description ,",
    "the bloch oscillations are known as a finite- oscillation motion of an electron in the periodical potential when the external dc electric field is applied . however",
    ", such finite motion can be understood setting on the exact solution of the schrdinger equation as follows .",
    "a particle moving in a periodical potential possesses the infinite bloch state which belongs to the continuous energy spectrum .",
    "the application of the external dc field changes the energy spectrum drastically .",
    "the electron states become spatially finite , belonging to the discrete energy spectrum called a wannier - stark ladder .",
    "the wave function for each state of the ladder manifests a localized state , while a wave packet of these functions describes the bloch oscillations . in general",
    ", the period of these oscillations is much larger than either the scattering time of electron with impurities or the zener tunneling time .",
    "for this reason , the bloch oscillations are never observed in the conventional crystal .",
    "in fact , the first observation of the wannier - stark ladder @xcite and the bloch oscillations @xcite has become possible using the semiconductor superlattices in which the shorter bloch oscillations period was attained .",
    "also the bloch oscillations have experimentally been observed for cold atoms and the bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the optical waveguide array ( owa )  considered in this paper enables us a visualization of the bloch oscillations in the spatial domain as an oscillatory light beam path .",
    "each waveguide is a homogeneous one and serves as an attractive atomic potential in the crystals .",
    "the dc field is mimicked by the monotonic change of the refractive index of the waveguides as one passes from one waveguide to another .",
    "the effect is reached , in particular , by applying the temperature gradient across the thermooptical material @xcite , by a suitable change of the waveguide geometrics @xcite , or by a circularly - curving the waveguides @xcite .    to describe the optical bloch oscillations in the array of parallel waveguides ( see .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , a very viable phenomenological model was proposed in @xcite .",
    "along with the optical bloch oscillations , this model was used to investigate some other various physical effects in the optical structures such as nonlinear bloch oscillations , the bloch oscillations in the waveguide arrays with the second - order coupling , the bloch - zener oscillations in optical waveguide ladders and binary superlattices , the gradon localization @xcite . within this model , a set of modal amplitudes @xmath0 are introduced which describe a behavior of the effective light amplitude along the @xmath1-th waveguide . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , these amplitudes obey the system of coupled equations @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the direction along the waveguide axis , the index @xmath4 determines the position of the waveguide in the array . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ intro ] ) describes the propagation of light beam along the isolated waveguide , the parameter @xmath5 being responsible for the refractive index ramp .",
    "the second term describes the influence of the nearest neighbor waveguides on the light propagation , the parameter @xmath6 being responsible for this influence .",
    "the phenomenological constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 entering eq . ( [ intro ] ) remain unknown and are obtained only as a result of comparison with an experiment .    to our knowledge , equations like ( [ intro ] ) have never been derived within the macroscopic electrodynamics approach .",
    "this approach assumes that the array of the infinite homogeneous waveguides is considered and the refractive index of each waveguide is known .",
    "a solution to the corresponding maxwell equations describes a distribution of the electromagnetic field in the whole space . for the array to possess the guided properties , the field should mainly be concentrated inside the array .",
    "thus , we are interested only in those solutions of the maxwell equations for the waveguide array which vanish as @xmath7 ( see . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "these are evanescent modes .",
    "it stands to reason , that the solution should possess a finite amplitude inside the array .",
    "the goal of the paper is to determine correctly the amplitudes @xmath0 , connecting them with a superposition of these guided mode solutions of the maxwell equations . a direct derivation of eq .",
    "( [ intro ] ) from the maxwell equations allows us to obtain the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 in terms of the workpiece geometrics and refractive indices of the waveguides and to establish the validity range of the model described by eq .",
    "( [ intro ] ) .    like in quantum mechanics , for the waveguide array under consideration two formulations of the problem are possible .",
    "the first one is the problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by the array .",
    "such problem is investigated in refs .",
    "the approach used in these papers is based on the exact solution for the scattering of the electromagnetic wave by a single infinite cylinder @xcite .",
    "the solution for the scattering mode does not vanish as it escapes from the array .",
    "the second task is similar to that of the bound states in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is related with the guided modes inherent in the array . for a single waveguide",
    ", the solution is found in @xcite .",
    "finding the solution for the waveguide array is just the goal of the paper .",
    "the approach we propose is similar to the multisphere mie scattering formalism developed in our previous papers @xcite to describe the high - quality guided modes in the arrays of spherical particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we derive the system of equations , which describes the guided modes in the array of parallel dielectric waveguides . for this purpose ,",
    "we expand the electromagnetic field in the vector cylinder harmonics .",
    "the system of equations obtained is a formally exact one for the guided mode propagating in the array and consists of the infinite number of equations . to make the problem solvable , we truncate it using the nearest neighbor approximation and zero - harmonic approach . under these simplifications ,",
    "one obtains that the amplitudes @xmath8 obey eq .",
    "( [ intro ] ) .",
    "finally , we apply the results obtained to treat the real experiments @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , not only qualitative but also reasonable quantitative agreement is found .",
    "let us consider the array of @xmath9 parallel cylindrical dielectric waveguides ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the axes of the waveguides are in the @xmath10-plane and are parallel to the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the array is equidistant , @xmath11 being the distance between the axes of the nearest waveguides . in this paper ,",
    "the array of infinite parallel cylinder waveguides is considered .",
    "all the waveguides are assumed to possess the same radius @xmath12 but different refractive indices @xmath13 .",
    "it is assumed that the contrast between the nearest waveguides is @xmath14 .",
    "suppose that a guided mode with a frequency @xmath15 is excited within the array . because of the translation invariance in the @xmath3 direction , all the components of the electromagnetic field describing the guided mode depend on the coordinate @xmath3 as @xmath16 , @xmath17 being a propagation constant ( the wave vector component in the @xmath3-direction ) of the guided mode .",
    "thus , all the components of the guided mode are proportional to the factor @xmath18 .",
