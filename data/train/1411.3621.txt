    "the nasa _ kepler _ mission employed a 0.95  m aperture schmidt telescope in solar orbit for a total of 4 years ( may 2009  may 2013 ) .",
    "_ kepler s _ focal plane was filled with 42 ccds to collect time series photometry on selected targets in a 115 square degree field .",
    "_ kepler _ detected transiting exoplanets from a sample of over 150,000 target stars , most of which fell in the _ kepler _ magnitude range @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , the _ kepler _ bandpass , spans roughly @xmath2  nm ) .",
    "the mission was designed to detect and quantify the population of small planets orbiting within or near the habitable zones ( hzs ) of sun - like stars @xcite .",
    "_ kepler _ has produced thousands of candidate planets , dozens of which are good hz or near - hz candidates @xcite . to help confirm the candidates as true exoplanets",
    ", the mission has relied on ground - based follow - up observations of the candidate host stars .",
    "the process of producing a list of transiting planets from _ kepler _",
    "data is a long one . first , raw pixel fluxes are calibrated @xcite , and light curves are extracted from apertures and reduced , correcting the flux time series by way of `` cotrending '' to remove variations correlated with ancillary spacecraft data @xcite . at the same time , nearby stars identified in the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used to estimate blended ( excess ) flux in the light curves , and this excess flux is removed . following reduction ,",
    "the light curves are searched for any significant periodic events similar to those of transiting planets @xcite .",
    "these `` threshold crossing events '' ( tces ) consist of true planet transits and false positives ( events appearing much like planet transits , but attributable to other phenomena ) .",
    "false positives include astrophysical sources like eclipsing binary stars , planets transiting nearby , fainter stars blended with the koi star , and instrumental artifacts occurring ( quasi-)periodically in the time series and which coincide when a light curve is searched on a certain period . here and after , `` koi star '' refers to the brightest star near the center of the _ kepler _ aperture as measured in the _ kepler _ bandpass ( an unambiguous definition for the sample in this study ) .",
    "cases where the tces are due to planets transiting stars other than the koi are treated as false positives because their planetary properties will have been miscalculated based on adoption of the koi star properties .",
    "such false positives should be removed from the koi list , if possible , to maintain it as a well - defined statistical sample .",
    "the tces are subjected to data validation through a series of automated tests @xcite and human inspection to weed out obvious false positives .",
    "those tces passing data validation are deemed _ kepler _ objects of interest ( kois ) and given a disposition that identifies some as planet candidates .",
    "the term koi can refer to planet candidates as well as their host stars .",
    "the koi list forms a large and relatively clean sample with respect to instrumental false positives , but still contains a significant number of astrophysical false positives .",
    "the false positive rate is uncertain , but is likely to be about @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations may be used to identify the false positives and more accurately characterize the host star properties from which planet properties are derived .",
    "for example , the high resolution follow - up imaging described here is used to determine the location and brightness of each star that contributes flux to planet candidate light curves because _ kepler _ imaging is optimized only for photometry ( having @xmath4 wide pixels , typical stellar profiles of @xmath5  fwhm and variably - sized photometric apertures that are typically several pixels across ) .",
    "the number of confirmed or validated _ kepler _ planets currently stands at 965 , which is 23% of the total number of both confirmed and candidate _ kepler _ planets ( 4233 ) .",
    "this relatively small fraction partially reflects the challenges to follow - up observing and analysis needed to confirm planets with a low level of false positive probability .",
    "this study presents the analysis of high spatial resolution observations of 18 koi stars and the 28 validated and candidate planets they harbor .",
    "the stellar sample is listed in table  [ table : spklobservations ] .",
    "each koi star has been observed using high resolution optical speckle imaging techniques to search for or put limits on the brightness of previously - unresolved neighboring stars .",
    "many have also been observed in the near - infrared ( near - ir ) with adaptive optics imaging with the same goals in mind .",
    "most of the host stars have been observed spectroscopically to define their stellar properties , while the others have stellar properties available in the literature .",
    "the high - resolution imaging is used to calculate a validation level for 18 planets around 12 of these stars by constraining the non - detection of nearby sources .",
    "two new validated planetary systems containing 5 planets are designated kepler-430 and kepler-431 .",
    "the effects of blending by neighboring stars are examined and quantified for planets orbiting the 7 affected stars and tests are performed that help to distinguish whether these neighboring stars are gravitationally - bound companions or field stars .",
    "these high resolution imaging and single epoch spectral observations prove to be an efficient follow - up method for planet validations and refinement of the planet and host star sample .",
    "such observations lead to a better understanding of the sample of small _ kepler _ planets .",
    "the sample analyzed here is a set of koi host stars observed with optical speckle imaging at gemini north during july 2013 .",
    "these targets were selected from the koi list at the time on the basis of two main considerations : ( 1 ) they were not previously observed with high resolution optical imaging at an 8  m or larger telescope and ( 2 ) they hosted a candidate planet having an estimated radius less than @xmath6 and/or a predicted planet equilibrium temperature @xmath7  k. at the time of target selection there was a total of 750 stars hosting at least one planet meeting this size constraint and 20 stars hosting at least one planet meeting the temperature constraint ( temperatures low enough to be considered hz candidates ) . since that time , planets have been validated for 140 of these 750 host stars , primarily as part of a validation study of planets in multiple planet systems @xcite , although most of these are lacking the high resolution imaging needed to thoroughly investigate their possible stellar multiplicity .",
    "a total of 25 of the brightest of these 750 stars was observed ( selected to include some with low equilibrium temperature ) , but 5 of the stars were subsequently found by the mission to be false positive events ( mostly cases where the variable was not the koi , but another star in the aperture ) .",
    "the results for two stars of the sample are discussed separately in the literature : koi  571 ( kepler-186 ) by @xcite and koi  2626 by @xcite .",
    "the remaining 18 stars discussed here ( table  [ table : spklobservations ] ) hosted a total of 28 candidates ( although some have been subsequently validated ) .    along with new observations ,",
    "analysis of these candidates began by inspecting ground - based data and _ kepler _ data products available from the web site of the _ kepler _ community follow - up observing program ( cfop ) .",
    "this included the @xmath8-band survey taken at ukirt ( by phil lucas ) that covers the entire _ kepler _ field under relatively good seeing conditions ( @xmath9  fwhm ) .",
    "the @xmath8 images were examined to locate stars nearby each koi .",
    "sources as close as @xmath10 ( corresponding to 408  au at the mean distance of the stellar sample ) could be readily seen in these images , but more importantly they covered areas outside of the relatively small fields of the follow - up high resolution images .",
    "another data product used were the _ kepler _ mission s data validation reports that show light curves and statistical tests on such things as the motion of stellar centroids in and out of transit , comparison of the depths of odd versus even numbered transits , offsets of the transit relative to predicted positions for the star , and in - transit versus out - of - transit pixel flux differences .",
    "the statistics in the validation reports help determine if any of the candidates are particularly suspect as false positives @xcite .",
    "the candidates discussed hereafter are `` good '' candidates in that the inspection uncovered nothing especially indicative of false positives .",
    "speckle imaging observations were obtained at gemini north during the interval ut 25@xmath1131 july 2013 . the differential speckle survey instrument ( dssi ) ,",
    "a dual - channel speckle imaging system described by @xcite , was configured with the 692  nm filter ( 40  nm fwhm ) on the first port and the 880  nm filter ( 50  nm fwhm ) on the second port . while the mounting of the camera went smoothly",
    ", there was a light - leak problem in the 880  nm channel on the night of 25 july ut , so the data from that channel was of significantly lower quality and will not be reported here .",
    "the problem was identified and eliminated by the start of 26 july ut .",
    "the pixel scale and orientation were measured by observing two well - known binary systems , hu  1176 ( ie .",
    "hip  83838 or hr  6377 ) and stt  535 ( ie .",
    "hip  104858 or hr  8123 ) .",
    "the known orbital elements from the sixth orbit catalog were used to calculate the position angle and separation at the time of the observation , and then compared with the raw pixel coordinates , thereby deriving the scale .",
    "each camera has a slightly different value .",
    "the final values were determined to be @xmath12 for the 692  nm camera and @xmath13 for the 880  nm camera .",
    "the position angle difference between pixel axes and celestial coordinates was determined to be @xmath14 .",
    "previous experiences and similar observations were taken during 2012 at gemini north and are described by @xcite .",
    "images were acquired simultaneously in both cameras .",
    "the raw data file for each camera consists of 1000 frames ( which is called an `` exposure '' ) ; at least three exposures were taken for each of the objects and were examined individually and then co - added to achieve the best possible final result . while the objects were acquired and centered on the two detectors with real - time full - frame readout ( @xmath15 pixels ) , the science exposures consisted of frames that were @xmath16-pixel subarrays , centered on the target .",
    "each frame was 60  ms in duration , meaning each exposure represented 1 minute of integration time .",
    "the choice for the number of exposures taken generally followed the magnitude of the target , as one would expect , with the fainter objects receiving more time , but also modified at the telescope depending on seeing , airmass and other factors .",
    "table  [ table : spklobservations ] gives the number of exposures and the _ kepler _ magnitudes for the systems under study .",
    "the seeing for the run varied between approximately fwhm@xmath17 , with substantial changes from exposure to exposure for some objects due to weather systems that were in the area at the time ( including tropical storm flossie , which grazed the hawaiian islands on ut 29 and 30 july ) .",
    "overall , the data from 27 july represents the bulk of what we present here .",
    "this was a relatively calm night with slightly better seeing than the run as a whole .",
    "the basic methodology for speckle data reduction has been described in previous papers , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter deals specifically with gemini data taken in 2012 .",
    "it is based on fourier analysis of correlation functions made from the raw speckle data frames .",
    "the autocorrelation is used to estimate the modulus of the object s fourier transform .",
    "a point source observation is required to deconvolve the point spread function ( which amounts to a division in the fourier domain ) .",
    "the triple correlation function can be used to generate the phase of the object in the fourier plane . combining these two functions , an estimate of the fourier transform of the object",
    "is obtained .",
    "this is then low - pass filtered with a gaussian function and inverse transformed to arrive at the final reconstructed image with a diffraction - limited resolution of fwhm@xmath18 .",
    "example reconstructed speckle images centered on the double source koi  1964 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : koi1964_4filters ] .    for _ kepler _ follow - up observations , we use the reconstructed images to measure the limiting magnitude difference of each observation as a function of distance from the primary star , that is , it is an estimate of the brightest star that could be missed as a function of separation from the primary . as shown in the previous papers , these curves are generally monotonically increasing as a function of separation , meaning that the limiting magnitude near the central star is lower than farther away from the star .",
    "up to the present , we have published @xmath19 confidence limits as a function of separation , using all peaks in the reconstructed image to generate a mean and standard deviation of the mean of the peak values .",
    "a detectable companion star then must have a peak value larger than the mean plus 5@xmath20 .",
    "for gemini data , the results on fainter targets from our run in july 2012 generally showed two image artifacts that were undesirable in the final reconstructed .",
    "these effects can combine to give a detectability curve with non - gaussian distribution of peak heights and/or a non - monotonic nature as a function of separation .",
    "we have studied these two effects in the fourier plane and developed two strategies to reduce their appearance in reconstructed images .",
    "first , the cross pattern on the image plane maps to a cross on the fourier plane , which can be cleanly seen in a region beyond the diffraction limit and removed by replacing the pixel values in the cross with an average of pixel values on either side .",
    "second , the correlated noise appears to be reduced when the point source used to do the deconvolution step is a better match to the point spread function of the target star .",
    "therefore , we have developed an algorithm to `` fine - tune '' the shape of our point source observation in the fourier plane based on estimating the difference in dispersion expected for the point source observation and the science target ( which is a function of observation time and sky position ) , and calibrating out the point source dispersion accordingly .",
    "these techniques appear to yield reconstructed images which are free of the cross and whose noise peaks have a more gaussian distribution .",
    "ten of the kois were observed with near - ir adaptive optics ( ao ) in the @xmath8 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 filters either at the lick observatory shane 3.5  m , the palomar observatory hale 5  m or the 10 m keck - ii telescope ( see table  [ table : aoobservations ] ) , as part of a general infrared ao survey of kois ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "targets observed with the lick , palomar , or keck ao systems utilized the ircal @xcite , pharo @xcite , or nirc2 @xcite instruments respectively .",
    "the observations were made in the @xmath8 filter for the lick observations , the @xmath8 and @xmath22 filters for the lick and palomar observations , and the @xmath21 filter for the keck observations .",
    "the targets themselves served as natural guide stars and the observations were obtained in a 5-point quincunx dither pattern at lick and palomar , and a 3-point dither pattern at keck to avoid the lower left quadrant of the nirc2 array .",
    "five images were collected per dither pattern position , each shifted @xmath23 from the previous dither pattern position to enable the use of the source frames for creating the sky image .",
    "the ircal array is @xmath16 with 75  mas pixels and a field of view of @xmath24 , the pharo array is @xmath25 with 25  mas pixels and a field of view of @xmath26 , and the nirc2 array is @xmath27 with 10  mas pixels and a field of view of @xmath28 .",
    "each frame was dark subtracted and flat fielded and the sky frames were constructed for each target from the target frames themselves by median filtering and coadding the 15 or 25 dithered frames .",
    "individual exposure times varied depending on the brightness of the target but typically were @xmath29  seconds per frame .",
    "data reduction was performed with a custom set of idl routines .",
    "aperture photometry was used to obtain the relative magnitudes of stars for those fields with multiple sources .",
    "point source detection limits were estimated in a series of concentric annuli drawn around the star . the separation and widths of the annuli",
    "were set to the fwhm of the primary target point spread function .",
    "the standard deviation of the background counts is calculated for each annulus , and the @xmath19 limits are determined within annular rings ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the psf widths for the lick , palomar , and keck images were typically found to be 4  pixels for the three instruments corresponding to @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32  fwhm respectively .",
    "typical contrast levels are @xmath33  magnitudes at a separation of 1  fwhm and @xmath34  magnitudes at @xmath35  fwhm with potentially deeper limits past 10  fhwm .",
    "an example of ao imaging done at palomar toward koi  1964 is shown in figure  [ fig : koi1964_4filters ] .",
    "this study includes observations in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 filters .",
    "the @xmath21 filter differs only slightly from @xmath22 ( with central wavelengths of @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively ) .",
    "because of this , the differential magnitudes of stars measured in either filter are treated as equivalent since any differences are expected to be slight . for calculations and modeling , the @xmath22 bandpass is used .",
    "most of the koi host stars ( 16 of 18 ) were observed spectroscopically at the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak during the 2010 and 2013 observing seasons . table  [ table : spectraobs ] lists the 11 spectra actually used to determine stellar properties ( other stars were too cool , too hot , or have published asteroseismology measurements of stellar properties as discussed in  [ subsec : literatureproperties ] ) .",
    "the stars were observed with integration times of @xmath38 minutes using the long - slit spectrograph rcspec setup to disperse the spectra with 0.072  nm  pixel@xmath39 at a nominal resolution of @xmath40  nm .",
    "the wavelength coverage with the best calibrated fluxes was approximately @xmath41  nm . more details of this observing program are discussed in @xcite .",
    "spectral frames are reduced in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , the overscan bias is subtracted and trimmed off each frame .",
    "bias frames and flat field frames are then combined , with outlier rejection , to form a master residual bias image and flat .",
    "these master frames are applied to each observation in the usual manner .",
    "stellar spectra are extracted using an aperture that traces the stellar image across the ccd and sky - subtracted using night sky spectra extracted from areas of the slit containing sky .",
    "wavelength calibration is provided by an arc lamp exposure at each pointing and flux calibration is done using an observation of a spectrophotometric standard star along with a kitt peak extinction curve scaled to the airmass of each observation . since focus changes significantly across the ccd , only the best focused portion of the spectrum is used for analysis ( @xmath42  nm where the focus is tight and important spectral features like h@xmath43 are found ) .",
    "the properties of the candidate host stars are estimated in a number of ways . for most stars ,",
    "a newly acquired spectrum , taken at the mayall 4 m telescope , is available as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : spectroscopy ] .",
    "in other cases , values are obtained from the literature and are variously based on asteroseismology , photometry , or spectral analysis used in conjunction with light curve fits . of all stellar properties ,",
    "the radius is the most fundamental for characterizing transiting exoplanets because it is used to derive the planet radius .",
    "it is worth noting that a number of the candidate host stars have neighboring stars closeby .",
    "when the apparent separations are small enough , the neighbors can affect both the follow - up photometry and spectroscopy as flux from the neighbor is introduced into the data .",
    "however , in most cases the neighbors are at least several magnitudes fainter and so the contamination is slight . to determine the properties of both the koi star and its neighbors , we take a two - step approach : first , the properties of the koi star are established from asteroseismology , if available , otherwise spectroscopy or , lastly , photometry when that is the only available source .",
    "second , once the properties of the koi star are established , the properties of the neighbors are estimated photometrically as will be discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : neighborproperties ] . in most cases ,",
    "the photometry of the neighbors is measured relative to the koi star , so determining the properties of the neighbors depends on first characterizing the koi star .      in the case of",

    "very briefly , each spectrum is iteratively fit to a grid of synthetic model spectra taken from @xcite , who parameterized their models using these three properties .",
    "the spectral models of @xcite are based on the stellar atmosphere models of @xcite , and were chosen by @xcite from among the publicly available model spectra for their well - sampled grid in parameter values .",
    "the model fitting method is calibrated using a set of similar spectra taken of test stars whose properties were well known _",
    "a priori_. parameter uncertainties for this method are based on the degree to which the fitted properties of the test star set matched their _ a priori _ values .",
    "the @xmath44 , @xmath45  and @xmath46 $ ]  values from these spectra are listed in table  [ table : stellarproperties ] and marked as coming from reference 1 or 3 .",
    "a mass , radius and luminosity is determined later for these stars based on isochrone fits ( see  [ subsec : isochronefits ] ) .      for some kois , we have no 4 m spectrum or the star was such that it could not be fit ( these spectral fits were reliable only within the effective temperature range @xmath47 ) . for these stars , values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 $ ]",

    "for those stars with only photometry , like the hot star koi  3204 , @xcite derive new stellar properties , first by identifying any giants using asteroseismology , then finding @xmath44  from the available photometry .",
