    "at the beginning of the 19th century , thomas young performed for the first time an experiment that still attracts strong interest in physics : the interference of light beams passing through a double slit @xcite .",
    "this experiment and its outcome have played a profound role in the development of optics and quantum mechanics and have been used since as a paradigm to unveil the wave nature of a number of physical entities , in particular single electrons @xcite , neutrons @xcite , atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite .",
    "recently , casati and prosen carried out a numerical simulation of a double - slit experiment with a well directed gaussian wave packet initially confined inside quantum billiards @xcite , whose classical dynamics are regular or chaotic .",
    "the time evolution of the wave packet is governed by the first - order time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the wave packets may leak out of the billiard via two slits in its sidewall .",
    "the interference patterns resulting from diffraction of the wave packet at the slit openings have been investigated . for the billiard with regular dynamics ,",
    "the interference pattern is similar to the well - known result obtained from a double - slit experiment with plane waves in the fraunhofer regime ( far field region ) ; i.e. , the intensity encountered on a screen is equal to the sum of the intensities from the two corresponding single - slit experiments plus an interference term @xcite . on the other hand , for the billiard with chaotic dynamics ,",
    "the intensity on the screen is equal to the superposition of the diffraction maxima radiated from each of the single slits . as a consequence",
    ", the intensity pattern becomes unimodal .",
    "the experiments described in the present work were initially motivated by these numerical studies .",
    "they were performed with flat cylindrical microwave cavities ( also called microwave billiards ) that have one or two openings in their side walls . below a certain excitation frequency ,",
    "only the lowest transverse magnetic modes with electric field perpendicular to the top and bottom plate of the cavity exist .",
    "accordingly , there the related helmholtz equation is identical with the time - independent schrdinger equation of the quantum billiard of corresponding shape @xcite .",
    "an appropriate choice of the shape of the cavity allows the investigation of wave phenomena in quantum billiards with regular , chaotic , or mixed dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the quantum case , the electromagnetic wave equation governing the time evolution of the waves in microwave billiards is of second order .",
    "still , as will be outlined below , the experiments provide insight into the dependence of the interference patterns resulting from such double - slit experiments on the classical dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : exp ] is devoted to the description of the experimental setup .",
    "stationary wave patterns originating from the diffraction of electromagnetic waves emitted from a single antenna , which is situated inside the microwave billiard , at the openings are presented in . in",
    "we investigate the temporal evolution of the diffracted waves in the exterior close to the slits . in",
    "we present a new method developed for the construction of a directed initial wave packet with an array of emitting antennas .",
    "it is used to realize the situation considered in the numerical simulation of ref .",
    "the principle of the construction of the microwave billiards is illustrated in , which exemplifies a billiard of rectangular shape .",
    "they are composed of three plates , @xmath0 mm thick , made of copper as depicted in .",
    "the middle plate has a hole in the form of the shape of the billiard .",
    "this yields a microwave cavity with a height of @xmath0 mm .",
    "one of its sides [ bottom side in ] is composed of three modular bars of copper enabling the variation of the slits size @xmath1 and distance @xmath2 ( see also ) between the slits , respectively .",
    "microwaves are excited inside the resonator via an antenna located at different positions ( crosses ) .",
    "the interference pattern resulting from microwaves leaving the billiard via the slits is recorded on a `` screen , '' which consists of a second antenna moving in the exterior ( see below ) . in order to investigate the relation between the dynamics of the corresponding classical billiard and the interference patterns , a regular billiard with rectangular form and a chaotic one with the shape of a desymmetrized tilted stadium , in the following simply called stadium ,",
    "were used in the experiments .",
    "the three plates are screwed together and wires of solder are inserted into grooves along the contour of the billiard [ not shown in ] in order to improve the electrical contact between the plates .",
    "the rectangular microwave billiard has dimensions .",
    "the ratio of the side lengths is taken close to the golden ratio @xmath3 in order to avoid degeneracies of the eigenmodes .",
    "the stadium billiard is composed of a quarter circle and a trapezoid @xcite .",
    "the radius of the quarter circle is @xmath4 mm , the length of the left side of the stadium is @xmath5 mm , and the length of the bottom side @xmath6 mm .",
    "the microwave power is coupled into and out of the setup with wire antennas .",
    "they consist of a straight thin wire of about diameter that is soldered in a holder .",
    "the electromagnetic signal is generated by a vectorial network analyzer ( vna ) of type pna - l n5230a by agilent technologies .",
    "it is led to one antenna ( port @xmath7 ) via a coaxial cable and fed into the cavity .",
    "this antenna penetrates partially into the cavity via a hole in the top plate .",
    "the output signal is received by another antenna ( port @xmath8 ) in front of the slits outside the billiards .",
    "the ratio of the output power ( @xmath9 ) and the input power ( @xmath10 ) as well as the relative phase of both signals are measured .",
    "they yield the complex - valued scattering ( @xmath11)-matrix elements .",
    "the squared modulus of the scattering matrix is given as @xmath12 a graphical representation of @xmath13 versus the excitation frequency is referred to as a frequency spectrum .",
    "resonance frequencies of the cavity are obtained from the locations of its peaks i.e.  resonances .",
    "close to the resonance frequency @xmath14 of the @xmath15th isolated resonance , the @xmath11-matrix element @xmath16 can be expressed in good approximation @xcite as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the full width at half maximum of the resonance .",
    "the numerator @xmath19 is proportional to the product of the electric field strengths at the positions @xmath20 of the antennas , i.e.@xmath21 accordingly , the electric field distribution @xmath22 may be determined @xcite by fixing the position of antenna @xmath7 , varying the position @xmath23 of antenna @xmath8 and measuring @xmath16 for each position of antenna @xmath8 , see below in .",
    "the electric field intensity @xmath24 at antenna @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath25 and thus to @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ fig : setupgrid ] illustrates schematically the experimental setup .",
    "microwave power is coupled into the billiard through , which penetrates @xmath27 mm into the cavity . in order to measure the leakage of microwave power through the slits to the exterior",
    ", the receiving antenna @xmath8 of @xmath28 mm length is moved outside of the billiard close to its edge with the slits ( see grid of positions in ) in steps of which is one third of the minimal considered wavelength .",
    "it is connected to the vna via a flexible cable .",
    "the distance @xmath29 between the billiard edge and the lines of measuring points parallel to the edge ( in the following referred to as the screen ) varies between @xmath30 and @xmath31 mm .",
    "the measurements were carried out in a so - called anechoic chamber ( see ) .",
    "pyramidal polyurethane foam structures ( from emerson & cuming ) cover the whole surface of the chamber and ensure attenuation of the reflected microwave power by @xmath32 db over the whole frequency range of the measurements @xcite .",
    "antenna @xmath8 is guided by a carriage attached to a positioning unit .",
    "this unit is driven by bipolar step motors and connected to a computerized numerical control ( cnc ) module .",
    "a pc program communicates with the vna and with the cnc , enabling the control of the positioning unit and the simultaneous gathering of data .",
    "antenna @xmath8 is aligned perpendicularly to the billiard plane to ensure that only the @xmath33 component of the electric field is detected . to prevent a change of the polarization of the electromagnetic field when it escapes into the three - dimensional free space , and to avoid parasitic reflections between the metallic parts of the measurement device and the billiard , all components",
    "are covered with microwave absorption material that consists of urethane foam sheets impregnated with carbon ( epp-51 material from arc technologies @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the copper cable connected to the receiving antenna is coated with an absorptive double layer consisting of urethane foam and urethane flat plate epf-11 .",
    "the vna is calibrated in order to remove the effects of the cables and the connectors on the measured spectra .",
    "these effects include reflections at connectors , attenuation in the cables and the time delay of the signal accumulated during its passage through the cables . for each position of antenna @xmath8 , the complex @xmath11-matrix element @xmath16 is measured between antennas @xmath7 and @xmath8 from @xmath34 to @xmath30 ghz with a frequency step of @xmath0 or . as a consequence the measurement of the frequency spectrum takes a few seconds for each of the @xmath35 positions of the receiving antenna .",
    "shows a frequency spectrum for the rectangular ( top ) and the stadium ( bottom ) billiard .",
    "the emitting antenna @xmath7 was positioned inside the resonator symmetrically with respect to the slits at a distance from the lower billiard edge and the receiving antenna @xmath8 outside at the point @xmath36 , ( see coordinate system introduced in ) . in both billiards",
    "the slit size @xmath1 is set to @xmath37 mm and the distance @xmath2 between the slits is @xmath38 mm .",
    "the spectrum shows many sharp peaks at resonance frequencies corresponding to quasibound modes . below the cut - off frequency ghz defined by the width @xmath1 of the slits , which have the effect of a short waveguide ( see ) on microwaves leaving the billiard ,",
    "the transmission amplitude is notably suppressed . here",
    ", @xmath39 denotes the velocity of light .",
    "note that , due to the short length of the waveguides , the cut - off frequency provides only an approximate value for the onset of the leakage of microwave power through the slits to the exterior .",
    "in we present the squared modulus of the measured transmission scattering matrix element @xmath26 at a resonance frequency indicated at the top of the respective panels as function of the position @xmath40 of antenna @xmath8 on the screen ( solid lines ) for the rectangular ( top panel ) and the stadium billiard ( bottom panel ) . the screen is located at a distance from the bottom edge of the billiard .",
    "the slit size and the distance between the slits are @xmath41 mm and @xmath42 mm , respectively .",
    "the position of the emitting antenna is symmetrical with respect to the slits , i.e.  @xmath36 . for the rectangular billiard ,",
    "we observe an interference pattern with a central maximum located at @xmath43 and two symmetrical lateral maxima .",
    "if the emitting antenna is placed nonsymmetrically with respect to the slits , we obtain a very similar interference pattern , i.e. , the measured patterns are nearly independent of the position of the emitting antenna as expected for a stationary field distribution inside the resonator . it should be noted that such interference patterns are observed only at frequencies of sharp resonances . the interference pattern for the rectangular billiard is well described by the fraunhofer formula , @xmath44 which is valid in the far field region if @xmath45 is fulfilled @xcite . for the parameters of the setup presented in , @xmath46 . here ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are the intensities radiated by each individual slit and the oscillatory term describes the interferences between the waves emitted through the slits @xcite .",
    "experimentally , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are obtained from measurements with , respectively , one of the slits closed .",
    "they are well described by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the curve obtained by inserting these intensities into is plotted as dashed line in the upper panel of , showing very good agreement with the measured interference pattern .",
    "similar results of a double - slit experiment with water surface waves instead of microwaves have been published in ref .",
    "@xcite where the motion of water waves in a tank with a shallow bottom was investigated . as in the case of microwaves the spatial propagation of the water waves",
    "is governed by the two - dimensional helmholtz equation and is equivalent to the schrdinger equation describing the dynamics in a quantum billiard of corresponding shape .",
    "an interference pattern measured with the stadium billiard is shown as solid line in the bottom panel of .",
    "at @xmath36 we observe a maximum in the interference pattern obtained for the rectangular billiard , whereas that for the stadium billiard exhibits a minimum .",
    "according to berry @xcite , the wave functions of a generic chaotic billiard can be modeled by a superposition of plane waves with the same wave number @xmath53 but random directions and random amplitudes @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 yielding a bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath56 for the spatial correlator @xcite , @xmath57 this implies that in the vicinity of the slits the waves are correlated as @xmath58 such that the interference term in is modified @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath59 for wave numbers @xmath60 with @xmath61 the interference term vanishes and the intensity should be equal to the sum of the intensities of the single - slit experiments . the intensity corresponding to is plotted as dashed line in the lower panel of . no agreement between and",
    "the experimental result is found .",
    "for the example shown in , the visibility @xmath62 of the measured pattern is comparable to that for the rectangular billiard . in general the patterns",
    "exhibit only for the rectangular billiard such a clear spatial symmetry .",
    "however , for all considered cases the interference structure does not disappear , even not for wave numbers for which the interference term should vanish according to .",
    "it should be noted also that the results for chaotic billiards with water surface waves @xcite do not provide convincing evidence that the total intensity equals the sum of the intensities for the single - slit experiments as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "examples of intensity distributions in the plane close to the slits are shown in for the rectangular ( left panels ) and stadium ( right panels ) billiard .",
    "the slit size is @xmath63 mm and the distance between the slits is set to @xmath64 mm .",
    "antenna @xmath7 is positioned at @xmath36 .",
    "the grid of the positions of antenna @xmath8 covers an area of . in the upper two left panels",
    "the intensity patterns at frequencies and corresponding to isolated resonances are shown .",
    "they are symmetric with respect to the line @xmath43 , as expected due to the symmetry of the setup . in the lower left panels",
    "the intensities for frequencies chosen in the regime of overlapping resonances are shown .",
    "we observe a slightly asymmetric interference pattern .",
    "this is explicable because several modes , which are symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the symmetry line , are excited simultaneously with different strengths such that the resulting field distribution has no spatial symmetry .",
    "furthermore , experimental imperfections might also contribute to the observed asymmetry .",
    "for the stadium billiard ( right panels of ) the observation of non - symmetric interference patterns both for frequencies in the regimes of isolated and of overlapping resonances is attributed to the random field distribution of the corresponding modes .",
    "there are even cases where microwave power leaks out through just one slit , as , for instance , for in .",
    "these results provide the first insight into the effect of the shape of the billiards on the interference patterns .    in order to analyze in more detail the interference patterns of the waves leaving the billiards we define the quantities @xmath65 @xmath66- \\arg [ e_z(x_0-\\delta x ) ] \\ , , \\ ] ] which correlate the intensities and the phases , respectively , of the electric field @xmath67 at points @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the central position on the screen .",
    "these correlators have been introduced and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and provide information about the symmetry and visibility of the interference structure . in a double - slit experiment with plane waves the phase difference of the exiting waves at the slits determines the symmetry of the obtained pattern whereas the amplitude difference should account for the visibility .",
    "if the amplitudes and the phases of the fields @xmath67 at the positions @xmath68 and @xmath69 coincide , i.e. if , the pattern is symmetric with visibility of @xmath71 .",
    "these correlators were evaluated for the measurements shown in .",
    "therefore , @xmath72 and the screen is located at the bottom side of the billiards at a distance from @xmath0 mm up to @xmath31 mm with a spatial resolution of @xmath0 mm in @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for each value of @xmath73",
    "the pair @xmath75 was determined for @xmath76 values of @xmath74 ( see ) , yielding a total number of @xmath77 measuring points .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath30 and , respectively .",
    "thirty resonance frequencies of the corresponding closed billiards are chosen as excitation frequencies .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath78 pairs of ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) .",
    "the resulting joint probability distribution of ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) is shown in .",
    "for the rectangular billiard ( left panel ) , the probability distribution is strongly concentrated around @xmath81 .",
    "this yields an evidence for the high ( though not perfect ) spatial symmetry of the measured interference patterns ( cf .",
    "the left panels of ) .",
    "for an ideal double slit experiment with plane waves , one would expect a nonvanishing distribution only at @xmath82 .",
    "the distribution for the stadium billiard is shown in the right panel .",
    "it is also centered around @xmath82 , but in comparison to the left panel much less concentrated in the direction of the @xmath80 coordinate .",
    "this is expected due to the slight asymmetry in the interference patterns of the stadium billiard observed in the right panels of . in the top and bottom panels of the distributions of ,",
    "respectively , the intensity and phase correlator are presented . the distributions of @xmath79 are almost identical for the rectangular ( solid line ) and the stadium ( dashed line ) billiard and decay exponentially with @xmath83 , i.e. , the visibility of the measured interference patterns is similar for both billiards ( cf .  ) .",
    "in contrast , the distributions of @xmath80 ( bottom panel ) differ markedly .",
    "while the distribution is peaked at @xmath84 for the rectangular billiard , i.e. , there most patterns are symmetric , it is bell shaped and much broader around @xmath84 for the stadium billiard . as above , this is attributed to the strongly nonsymmetrical patterns caused by the random field distributions as shown in the right panels of . in conclusion ,",
    "the distributions of the correlators show a clear difference for the interference patterns of the regular rectangular and the chaotic stadium billiard .",
    "in this section we analyze and discuss the time evolution of the field in the vicinity of the double slit .",
    "the emitting antenna @xmath7 is placed inside the billiard symmetrically with respect to the slits at a distance of @xmath85 mm to the edge with the slits whereas the distance @xmath29 of the screen to this edge equals @xmath86 mm .",
    "close to an isolated resonance , @xmath16 is essentially given by a modified green function up to a factor that varies slowly with the frequency @xcite .",
    "consequently , the propagator @xmath87 is related to the fourier transform of the experimentally obtained scattering matrix @xcite , i.e. , @xmath88 the experimental spectra are measured at @xmath89 discrete frequencies in the range from @xmath90 to @xmath91 and , correspondingly , the discrete fourier transform is evaluated in . the maximal time accessible",
    "is determined by @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the frequency step used in the experiment . in the present measurements @xmath94 mhz , which corresponds to a maximal time of @xmath76 ns .",
    "the upper panels of show the time evolution of the intensity on the screen for the rectangular ( left ) and the stadium ( right ) billiard , i.e. , @xmath95 versus the position @xmath40 of antenna @xmath8 .",
    "the time a wave emitted from antenna @xmath7 needs to reach antenna @xmath8 on the screen is called escape time . at each escape time , an interference pattern is observed as an intensity variation along @xmath40 .",
    "it results from the interference between the waves emitted from the two slits . as a result of the spatial symmetry of the rectangular billiard and the choice of the position of the emitting antenna @xmath7 at @xmath43 , every part of the cylindrical wave pulse emitted by this antenna with initial momentum direction @xmath96 travels the same path as its counterpart with @xmath97 .",
    "this is a consequence of the omnidirectionality of the initial wave pulse .",
    "accordingly , these waves hit the slits with no phase difference .",
    "the positions of the maxima and minima observed in the intensity pattern in the upper left panel of do not change with time .",
    "for the stadium billiard , however , there is no spatial symmetry and , consequently , the positions of the maxima and minima in the upper right part of change with time .    in order to quantify how the interference patterns are influenced by the time evolution of the waves emitted from the two slits , for each position @xmath40 of antenna @xmath8 the intensities @xmath95 determined at discrete times @xmath98",
    "are averaged over time up to @xmath99  ns , yielding @xmath100 .",
    "it should be noted that this quantity corresponds to the averaged current evaluated in the numerical simulation by casati and prosen  @xcite .",
    "the time average is performed up to @xmath101 ns since @xmath95 is negligibly small for longer times .",
    "the resulting time - averaged intensities are shown in the lower panels of as solid lines .",
    "for the rectangular billiard the interference structure is still clearly visible , whereas it disappears for the stadium billiard .",
    "in addition , the sum of the time - averaged intensities @xmath102 obtained from two single - slit experiments in which the left , respectively , right slit was closed ( dashed lines ) is shown for comparison .",
    "it has no interference structure and shows a qualitative agreement with the time - averaged intensity resulting from the double - slit experiment only for the fully chaotic stadium billiard .",
    "if the emitting antenna is not placed on the symmetry line , the interference pattern of the time - averaged intensity distribution disappears also for the rectangular billiard and resembles that for the stadium cavity .",
    "indeed , waves emitted with initial wave vector @xmath96 and @xmath97 do not cover the same path length until they reach the slits and thus they have a phase relation varying in time .",
    "this finding confirms that the mechanism leading to the emergence of the interference patterns observed in the left panels of is not linked to the classical dynamics of the billiard but to spatial symmetry properties of the system consisting of the billiard with the slits and the emitting antenna .",
    "we may expect from these results that no interference patterns are observed when the slits are not positioned symmetrically .",
    "this was not tested experimentally , though . only recently our attention was drawn to a work by fonte and zerbo , where similar results as observed in our measurements were obtained with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we also performed ray - tracing simulations , where classical pointlike particles were injected from the position of antenna @xmath7 with the angles of initial direction sweeping the whole interval from @xmath56 to @xmath103 .",
    "the time of flight @xmath104 the particles need to reach the position of antenna @xmath8 was computed .",
    "we observe a good agreement between the measured time spectra @xmath95 and the classical ones up to a time @xmath105  ns which correponds to a length of @xmath106 m. the latter are obtained by counting the number of particles that need a certain time of flight and plotting it versus @xmath104 .",
    "the results of the experiments with a single emitting antenna presented in this section thus lead to the following conclusions :    * clear interference patterns that are symmetric with respect to the two slits are observed only for the rectangular billiard with the emitting antenna placed on the symmetry line @xmath36 .",
    "these are well described by the fraunhofer formula , .",
    "furthermore , the time averaged intensities show clear interference patterns for the rectangular billiard if the emitting antenna is positioned symmetrically .",
    "* interference patterns are not observed in the time - averaged intensities resulting from the stadium billiard and also not for the rectangular billiard with the emitting antenna placed asymmetrically with respect to the slits .",
    "* for the stadium billiard , the sum of the time - averaged intensities of the two single - slit experiments is roughly equal to that of the double - slit experiment .",
    "the experiments presented in this section were performed with an omnidirectional wave pulse emitted from a single antenna . however , as mentioned in , the initial states considered in the numerical simulations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite are localized wave packets with a well - defined direction . for the realization of a similar experimental situation we developed a method for the construction of directional wave packets using an array of antennas , which is presented in the following section .",
    "it was used recently in ref .",
    "@xcite to generate plane waves from a superposition of cylindrical waves .",
    "in this section we present a new method for the construction of directional wave packets . their time evolution is used for the analysis of the experimental spectra in order to study the dependence of the interference patterns on the billiard geometry as well as on the initial angle .",
    "an arbitrary initial state @xmath107 evolves according to @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the electromagnetic propagator between two antennas at positions @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the second term in can be set to zero by a proper choice of initial conditions , i.e. , @xmath112 . for the analysis of the experimental data we replace @xmath109 by the fourier transform @xmath113 of the measured transmission scattering matrix element",

    "it is proportional to a sum over the fourier transforms of the spectra weighted by complex coefficients .",
    "the initial direction and the width of the wave packet can be varied arbitrarily since @xmath122 and @xmath118 are free parameters .",
    "however , the width @xmath118 should be chosen larger than the minimal wavelength used in the experiments , i.e.  . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is chosen to be much larger than the size of the domain of emitting antennas , the coefficients would all be approximately equal to @xmath123 such that all antennas would provide the same contribution to the sum in .",
    "thus @xmath118 is chosen of the order of the size of this domain .",
    "we tested the propagation of the wave packet constructed according to experimentally in free space . a single emitting antenna @xmath7 hung down from the ceiling of an empty room at a position @xmath124 and the position @xmath125 of the receiving antenna was varied in the vicinity of @xmath114 in a plane perpendicular to the emitting wire antenna .",

    "the period of the escape times in the upper left panel agrees well with the length of the bouncing ball orbit , @xmath135 m. in the top right panel of the time - averaged spatial intensity displays an interference pattern with visibility @xmath62 close to @xmath71 .",
    "the initial angle @xmath130 = @xmath131 corresponds to the periodic orbit shown in the inset of the left middle panel of .",
    "the peak structure observed in the middle left panel does not show a clear periodicity .",
    "this is attributed to the spreading of the wave packet in additional directions ( cf . ) .",
    "the visibility of the corresponding interference pattern ( see middle right panel of ) is .",
    "the initial angle corresponds to the orbit depicted in the inset of the bottom left panel of . for this case",
    "the peaks appear stochastically .",
    "still , the time - averaged spatial intensity depicted in the bottom right panel shows interference patterns with visibility close to .",
    "the presence of a few prominent peaks , especially that at about @xmath136 m , in the time spectrum suggests that these dominate the interference pattern . however , the shape of the interference pattern is barely modified if the largest peak is removed .",
    "the same initial angles are chosen in the stadium billiard .",
    "the results are shown in .",
    "the peaks in the top left panel ( @xmath137 ) again appear periodically , where the period is equal to the length of the vertical diffractive orbit shown in the inset , which is .",
    "the visibility of the interferences is less than that for the rectangular billiard and is approximately .",
    "in addition , the peaks are slightly nonsymmetrical with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "thus , in spite of remains of interferences , there are visible differences to the rectangular billiard in the interference patterns ( see the top right panel of ) . the dominant peaks in the middle left panel ( @xmath138 ) display a periodic structure that again corresponds to the period of the vertical diffractive orbit , indicating that a part of the wave packet sticks in the vicinity of this periodic orbit . in addition , further narrow peaks in between are observed .",
    "the visibility of the interference pattern shown in the middle right panel of is moderately lower than the one for the rectangular billiard ( see the middle right panel of ) . in the bottom left panel ( @xmath139 ) the escape times exhibit no periodicity .",
    "the interferences disappear almost completely and the visibility is approximately @xmath140 .",
    "generally , the differences between the intensity patterns originating from the rectangular and the stadium billiard with regular and chaotic dynamics , respectively , are especially large for initial angles close to @xmath141 .",
    "a question that immediately arises is why in the regular case interferences are well pronounced only for certain initial angles .",
    "we performed double - slit experiments with waves leaving a microwave billiard whose dynamics is either regular or chaotic .",
    "microwaves were coupled into the resonators with differently arranged antennas , and the dependence of the interference patterns on a screen outside the billiard on its dynamics , the mode of excitation and the initial direction of the signal were analyzed .",
    "the emission of a wave pulse from a single antenna generates an omnidirectional pulse .",
    "unless the system consisting of the billiard with the two slits and the emitting antenna is fully symmetric , the waves travel along different paths in the billiard before exiting through the slits . for an asymmetric setup the interference pattern measured on a screen at a certain distance from the lower edge of the billiard changes with time .",
    "consequently , when averaging over time the interference patterns vanish .",
    "thus , their emergence does not only depend on whether the dynamics inside the billiard is regular or chaotic , whereas the choice of a definite direction of the initial momentum of the wave packet seems to be crucial @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experiments with a square array configuration of emitting antenna positions were carried out .",
    "the superposition of the fourier transforms of the spectra measured successively for each of these positions provides a method to create a directed wave packet .",
    "a test of it in free space indeed yielded propagation of the wave packet in a specific direction , although it spreads out quickly and has additional propagation directions . for the rectangular billiard with regular dynamics a clear interference pattern with @xmath142 visibility is only observed if the initial wave packet is sent along its symmetry line . in the stadium billiard with chaotic dynamics remnants of interferences",
    "are observed practically for all initial angles of the directed wave packet although the visibility is in general smaller than for the rectangular cavity . for angles close to @xmath141 the interferences",
    "are almost completely suppressed , whereas they appear with high visibility ( about @xmath143 ) for the rectangular one .",
    "the underlying mechanism for the formation of interferences is not fully understood since the high sensitivity of the patterns to the choice of the initial parameters of the wave packet does not allow to draw final conclusions .    in conclusion ,",
    "the numerical results presented by casati and prosen @xcite are only approximately reproduced for certain initial directions for both the rectangular and the stadium billiard .",
    "these discrepancies can not be attributed to the different orders in time of the electromagnetic wave equation and the schrdinger equation since the interference patterns always result from a time average .",
    "it should be noted that in the simulations performed by casati and prosen the sharp distinction between patterns from billiards with regular and chaotic dynamics was only obtained for certain initial conditions , too @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that further investigations are necessary for an understanding of the interference patterns .",
    "repeating the present measurements with visible light is desirable because a higher ratio between the cavity size and the wavelength can be realized , i.e. , the system will be closer to the semiclassical limit .",
    "preparations of appropriately shaped optical cavities with regular and chaotic dynamics , respectively , are underway .",
    "we acknowledge t.  prosen and h .- j .",
