    "the random matrix theory ( rmt ) is a very useful mathematical formalism which allows to describe universal properties of complex quantum systems .",

    "determine various universality classes sharing the same global symmetries .    a special case of the constant variance of the off - diagonal elements @xmath13 corresponds to the archetypal wigner  dyson rmt [ ] .",
    "it has a great number of applications starting from nuclear physics to quantum chaos to mesoscopic physics @xcite .",
    "ergodic wavefunctions and a level repulsion are essential features of the wigner  dyson rmt .",
    "recently , _ unconventional _ rmts characterized by decreasing function @xmath11 have attracted a substantial interest ( see , for instance , detailed introductions in references [ ] ) .",
    "this interest is stimulated , in particular , by a possibility to explore the properties of localized and critical disordered systems .",
    "for example , if the off - diagonal matrix elements are essentially non - zero only inside a band centered at the main diagonal and decay exponentially fast to zero outside the band , all eigenfunctions are exponentially localized .",
    "this _ banded _",
    "rmt describes the physics of a quasi - one - dimensional disordered wire @xcite .",
    "if @xmath11 decays only as a power - law outside the band @xcite , @xmath14 , the eigenfunctions are power - law localized for @xmath15 . the wigner ",
    "dyson universality class is approached for @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the _ power - law banded _",
    "rmt ( plbrm ) can interpolate between the wigner ",
    "dyson statistics and the poisson statistics of localized system .",
    "the special case @xmath17 corresponds to a critical behavior similar to that found at the point of the anderson metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath18 for the one - parametric family of the critical plbrm can be defined as follows : @xmath19 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of this critical model remain multifractal at any @xmath12 ranging from the weak multifractality at the large band - width @xmath20 , to the strong multifractality for the _ almost diagonal _ rmt @xmath21 .      the considerable progress in the banded and the power - law banded rmt has become possible due to the mapping @xcite onto the nonlinear supersymmetric @xmath23-model @xcite , which is a powerful filed - theoretical description of various averaged correlation functions .",
    "however , such a mapping is only justified in the large bandwidth limit .",
    "this limitation comes from the saddle - point approximation which is a crucial step in the derivation of the @xmath22-model .",
    "physically it corresponds to the diffusive approximation which implies in particular that the smooth envelope of a typical eigenfunction changes slowly on the scale of the mean free path .",
    "this approximation fails in the opposite limit of the small bandwidth , including the case of the _ almost diagonal rmts _ where the bandwidth shrinks to zero and the off - diagonal matrix elements are assumed to be parametrically smaller than the diagonal ones , @xmath24 .",
    "let us represent the almost diagonal matrix as a sum of the diagonal part and a matrix of the small off - diagonal elements @xmath25 .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath26 represents `` non - interacting '' energy levels or localized eigenstates .",
    "the presence of the small off - diagonal matrix @xmath27 leads to a weak `` interaction '' between different localized states . in order to calculate correlation functions",
    ", one can perform an expansion in the number of interacting localized states @xcite .",
    "the small parameter @xmath28 is the control parameter of this procedure .",
    "this method was called @xcite  `` _ a virial expansion _ '' ( ve ) by analogy with the expansion of thermodynamic functions of a dilute system in powers of density with the @xmath3-th virial coefficient being governed by collisions of @xmath29 particles .",
    "these ideas were initially implemented in a semi - empirical real - space renormalization group approach which has been applied for critical systems with long - range interactions @xcite and for a quantum kepler problem @xcite .",
    "the real - space renormalization group was also used to study the critical almost diagonal plbrm @xcite : the spectral correlations and the scaling properties of the eigenfunctions were investigated by considering a resonant interaction of two energy levels .",
    "the renormalization group approach has however two serious disadvantages : ( i )  it does not allow for a rigorous control of omitted contributions ; ( ii )  due to technical difficulties , it is almost impossible to go beyond the leading term , thus the resonant interaction of three and more levels remains inaccessible in this framework .",
    "a rigorous counterpart of the renormalization group approach has been suggested in recent works [ ] .",
    "it deals with a _ regular _",
    "ve generated with the help of the trotter formula ( tve ) @xcite . based on the classification of perturbation series by a number of the interacting levels involved , tve allows one to study the density of states and spectral correlations of the almost diagonal rmts .",
    "the accuracy of the tve is always controllable resulting in the rigorous perturbation theory .",
    "the second disadvantage of the renormalization group has been also partly overcome : the tve allows to go beyond the leading term by considering the interaction of two and three levels . in this way",
    "the first and the second virial coefficients have been calculated for a generic model of the almost diagonal rmts .",
    "the general formulas have been applied @xcite to the different models of almost diagonal rmts , including critical plbrms @xcite , the unitary moshe - neuberger - shapiro model @xcite , and the rosenzweig - porter model @xcite in the regime of crossover .",
    "the tve involves a complicated combinatorial part of intermediate calculations .",
    "the combinatorial problem appeared there resembles a coloring problem of closed graph edges .",
    "if one considers the density of states @xcite , the coloring is similar to the well studied problem of the graph theory @xcite whose solution is known @xcite .",
    "however a study of spectral correlations requires to resolve much more complicated problem of simultaneous coloring of several graphs @xcite .",
    "a complexity of the combinatorial calculations grows tremendously with increasing the number of the interacting energy levels .",
    "therefore the tve can be used practically only for calculation of the first and the second virial coefficients .      in the present work",
    "we formulate a _ supersymmetric field - theoretical representation for the ve _ of different correlation functions of the generic model ( [ rmtdef ] ) .",
    "the method of the supersymmetry allows us to perform an averaging over rm ensemble for an arbitrary function @xmath30 .",
    "the supersymmetric ve is controlled by a small parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the virial coefficients are straightforwardly derived in a general form in terms of the integrals over supermatrices .",
    "it is important that no combinatorics appear in the intermediate field - theoretical calculations . in this framework ,",
    "the interaction of @xmath4 energy levels is described by an integral containing only @xmath4 independent supermatrices associated with @xmath4 different sites in the real space . in order to calculate the integrals over supermatrices",
    "explicitly we employ a parametrization introduced recently in ref . [ ] .",
    "the suggested supersymmetric field theory ( susyft ) can be equally applied both to the spectral correlations and to the correlations of the eigenfunctions taken at different energies and in different space points .",
    "we emphasize that this approach is the unique analytic tool to describe the wavefunctions correlations for the almost diagonal rmts .",
    "neither the real space renormalization group nor the tve are capable to do this .",
    "we would like to mention also that susyft might be useful for non - perturbative calculations as well , however this issue is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present the susyft and give main definitions in the section [ sectmaindef ] .",
    "the basic ideas and parameters of the ve are explained in the section [ sectve ] with a reference to susyft .",
    "a general integral expression for @xmath3-th virial coefficient governed by the interaction of @xmath4 supermatrices is presented in the section [ sectvircoef ] . in this section",
    "we also discuss in detail the validity of a saddle - point integration over massive degrees of freedom and the applicability of the ve .",
    "we exemplify the integral calculations for the cases of 2- and 3-matrix interaction in the section [ sect2and3q ] and discuss advantages of the method and possible further applications in conclusions .",

    "a generalization to other symmetry classes is straightforward .",
    "the green s functions are an efficient tool to study different correlation functions .",
