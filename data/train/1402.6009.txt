    "<S> the identification of the transitions is based on the polarization analysis shown in figures [ fig : fig1]c and d. under linearly polarized laser excitation , only the highest energy peak shows linear polarization in emission and is therefore ascribed to the x@xmath4 , as a coherent superposition of valley states is created @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation of exciton alignment is independent of the direction of the incident laser polarization , which confirms that the observed linear polarization is not due to macroscopic birefringence in the sample ( see figure [ fig : figs6 ] ) . the strong remaining coherence in figure [ fig : fig1]d following non - resonant excitation hints at a direct optical generation of the neutral exciton x@xmath4 for the laser energy used , energetically below the free carrier absorption and well below the b - exciton . under circularly polarized excitation in figure [ fig : fig1]c , the two highest energy transitions are strongly polarized , as expected for the x@xmath4 and the trion . the clear separation by 30 mev of the trion ( pl fwhm 15  mev ) and neutral exciton ( pl fwhm 10  mev ) is a major advantage compared to current mos@xmath0 ml samples for the independent investigation of the valley dynamics . energetically below the trion emission </S>",

    "<S> the main x@xmath4 emission time can not be resolved by our experiment , it decays within 4ps as shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] , in a very similar way to ml mos@xmath0 @xcite . as a result of the short pl emission time </S>",
    "<S> , the coherence time could be as short as a few ps and still result in a strong linear polarization degree of the time - integrated pl @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the short x@xmath4 emission time is limited by radiative recombination in this system with predicted exciton binding energies of several hundred mev @xcite or by non - radiative processes , is still an open question . </S>",
    "<S> the weak pl emission at later times can be well fitted by a simple exponential decay with a characteristic time of 30 ps . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this longer time may be attributed to exciton - phonon scattering , which scatters the exciton out of the light cone . </S>",
    "<S> the excitons have subsequently to reduce their momenta via scattering to return to the light cone to recombine radiatively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possible origin of the emission comes from neutral excitons localised at fluctuations of the coulomb potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that this type of weak localisation is qualitatively different from forming bound states such as the @xmath20 in gaas , that might have parallels to the complexes l1 and l2 . </S>",
    "<S> + the trion pl emission can be fitted by a bi - exponential decay . </S>",
    "<S> we observe no measurable risetime of the trion pl signal within our resolution . </S>",

    "<S> allow for a more detailed polarization analysis in the case of the trion compared to the ultra - short x@xmath4 emission . the trion emission time being longer than the x@xmath4 emission time is a trend also observed in iii - v @xcite and ii - vi @xcite semiconductor quantum wells , where the longer trion emission time was ascribed to a lowering of the oscillator strength due to a stronger localisation . + for the peak labelled l1 </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) same as ( a ) , but for localized exciton emission l1.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    we now discuss the time evolution of the pl polarization that gives access to the valley dynamics . due to the fast decay time of the main x@xmath4 emission ( limited by our temporal resolution ) , we can not extract a meaningful polarization decay time . according to recent estimations @xcite neutral excitons from non - equivalent </S>",
    "<S> k valleys in tmdcs are coupled by the coulomb exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this could lead to a rapid decay of the optically initialized circular polarization , in close analogy to neutral exciton depolarization in gaas quantum wells @xcite and will contribute to the fast inter - valley relaxation decay observed in 1ml mos@xmath0 in pump - probe experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of a neutral exciton created with @xmath23 light in the k@xmath24 valley to an exciton in the k@xmath25 valley is efficient as it does rely on single carrier ( electron or hole ) spin flips , which are energetically forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> + the initial trion emission time is much longer than the one of the x@xmath4 in figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3]b , it decays within a few tens of ps , well above the temporal resolution of our experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the longer trion emission time allows us to access the time evolution of the valley polarization : we first observe an initial decay from 50% down to about 20% with a characteristic time of 12ps . concerning the origin of this initial decay : </S>",
    "<S> the trion could be either generated directly following photon absorption ( phonon assisted process ) , or by a localised electron capturing a free exciton . </S>",
    "<S> this second scenario is unlikely , as within the initial decay of 12ps the neutral exciton polarization would have already decayed to zero before capture , which is in contradiction with the strong , remaining valley polarization . for times </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 we can infer a typical decay time of about 1ns for this substantial polarization , as indicated in figure [ fig : fig3]b . </S>",
    "<S> please note that a typical decay time of 150  ps gives an estimation that is clearly below the observed experimental polarization , whereas a decay time of 3  ns still gives a good fit ( see dotted lines in figure [ fig : fig3]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the trion pl polarization dynamics show clear , experimental proof of the robustness of the optically initialised valley polarization . </S>",
    "<S> measurements carried out at different laser excitation energies show similarly encouraging results ( see figure [ fig : figs5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to ml mos@xmath0 , which shows a strong decrease of the pl polarization when the laser excitation energy increases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this difference could be due to the fact that the @xmath27 valence states are very close in energy to the k states ( a few mev @xcite ) in mos@xmath0 whereas for wse@xmath0 the splitting energy is considerably larger . </S>",
    "<S> + the emission we labelled l1 shows a fast initial polarization decay with a characteristic time of about 13  ps before reaching a polarization plateau as in the trion case , albeit at a smaller value around 8% . in reference </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in a gated wse@xmath0 ml structure a peak approximately at the energy of l1 was ascribed to a fine structure split trion state . </S>",
    "<S> although the linewidth of the pl emission of the x@xmath4 , trion and l1 is considerably smaller than in mos@xmath0 , we can not extract any information at this stage concerning an eventual fine structure due to strong coulomb exchange in this system @xcite , which might influence the observed polarization dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion , time resolved pl experiments in monolayer wse@xmath0 allow to access directly the valley dynamics by monitoring the charged exciton ( trion ) emission . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a valley polarization decay time longer than 1 ns . to verify valley stability beyond this time </S>",
    "<S> range pump - probe measurements are needed . </S>",
    "<S> similar results can be expected for ml mos@xmath0 , but are currently far more difficult to extract due to the broader ( roughly @xmath28 ) linewidth at 4k and also 300k in exfoliated samples . </S>"
