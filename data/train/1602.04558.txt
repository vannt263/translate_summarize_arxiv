    "neutron stars are one of the very few suitable environments that realize the extreme conditions where the density inside the star easily becomes greater than the nuclear saturation density , the magnetic fields inside and around the star can be quite strong , and the gravitational field becomes much stronger than that in the solar system .",
    "so , via observables associated with neutron stars , one can expect to get crucial information that is quite difficult to obtain on earth .",
    "in such attempts , the stellar mass and/or radius must be important information .",
    "in fact , the discovery of neutron stars with mass @xmath0 has excluded some soft equations of state ( eoss ) with which the expected maximum mass can not reach @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the stellar mass and radius may be weak information if one focuses on the crust properties , because the crust thickness is at most @xmath2 of the stellar radius , and the stellar mass and radius are not very sensitive to the crustal properties . in this case",
    ", the oscillation spectra of neutron stars could provide additional / alternative observable information to extract the interior properties of neutron stars .",
    "this technique is known as asteroseismology , which is similar to seismology for the earth and helioseismology for the sun .",
    "so far , there have been many attempts to measure stellar properties via oscillation spectra , such as the stellar mass , radius , and eos ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the imprint of quark matter inside the star @xcite , and magnetic properties ( e.g. , refs .",
    "in addition to theoretical studies , there have been recent attempts to actually extract the stellar properties by fitting observational data ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the structure of neutron stars strongly depends on the eos for neutron star matter .",
    "although the eos ( even for a high - density region ) should be somehow constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments , it is quite difficult to make a constraint on the eos for regions with densities much higher than the saturation density , due to the nature of the saturation property of nuclear matter .",
    "thus , there are still many uncertainties in the eos for neutron star matter , especially for high - density region , which leads to the difficulty of determining the exact structure of neutron stars .",
    "even in such a situation , we have a consensus about the conceptual structure of neutron stars @xcite",
    ". a thin ocean may exist under the atmosphere at the outermost part of neutrons stars .",
    "then , matter inside the ocean forms a coulomb lattice and behaves as a solid , which corresponds to the crust region of neutron stars .",
    "also , the neutrons confined in the nuclei begin to drip out when the density becomes greater than @xmath3 g/@xmath4 . a crust region with a density lower ( higher ) than this critical density corresponds to the outer ( inner ) crust .",
    "it is thought that the majority of the crust region is composed of spherical nuclei forming a body - centered cubic lattice , but it may be possible to deform the shape of nuclei at the bottom of the crust region ( such as the so - called pasta structure ) @xcite .",
    "anyway , the matter eventually becomes uniform when the density becomes more than the critical density ( which depends on the eos ) , which is around @xmath5 times the nuclear saturation density .",
    "the region inside the crust region becomes a fluid core , whose properties play an important role in determining the radius and mass of the neutron star .    in the case when one attempts to extract the information around the saturation density via the observations of a neutron star , the phenomena associated with the crust region become crucial . on the other hand , as mentioned later in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , the eos around the saturation point can be expanded as a function of the baryon number density and neutron excess with the saturation parameters , such as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "in particular , since the incompressibility ( @xmath6 ) and the so - called slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy ( @xmath7 ) among the saturation parameters are relatively difficult to determine via terrestrial nuclear experiments , astronomical observations should be helpful to constrain @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in practice",
    ", the crustal oscillations in neutron stars could tell us the imprint of the crustal properties , which depend on @xmath6 and/or @xmath7 .",
    "this is a motivation for considering the crustal torsional oscillations .    from the asteroseismological point of view",
    ", gravitational waves must be the most promising astronomical information , although their direct detection has not yet occurred .",
    "on the other hand , the discovery of the quasiperiodic oscillations in giant flares or in smaller bursts observed from soft - gamma repeaters @xcite gives the opportunity to adopt the asteroseismology to extract stellar information . in practice , in order to explain these quasiperiodic oscillations theoretically , there have been many attempts in terms of the crustal torsional oscillations @xcite and/or magnetic oscillations of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of ruling out a specific strange star model by using the observed quasiperiodic oscillations was also suggested @xcite . through such recent analyses about the oscillations of magnetized neutron stars , it has been found that the magnetic oscillations can be coupled with the crustal oscillations when the strength of magnetic fields is larger than a critical field strength , such as @xmath8 g @xcite .",
    "that is , one has to consider the magnetoelastic torsional oscillations for strongly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "in addition to the effect of magnetic fields , the superfluidity inside the star could also play an important role in neutron star oscillations @xcite .",
    "even so , since there are still many uncertainties in the magnetic distribution and strength and in the physics of superfluidity inside neutron stars , an analysis of pure crustal torsional oscillations could be valuable .",
    "in fact , identifying the observed quasiperiodic oscillations with the crustal torsional oscillations allows one to make a constraint on the saturation parameters in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "however , in general , the determination of the frequencies of crustal torsional oscillations is not so easy , because one should solve the eigenvalue problems in the relativistic framework .",
    "additionally , the frequencies could depend on not only the stellar mass and radius but also the crust eos .",
    "that is , if an empirical formula for the frequency of crustal torsional oscillations does exist , it is useful to identify the observations with the crustal torsional oscillations without any complicated tasks .",
    "with respect to this demand , in this paper we successfully derive such an empirical formula as a function of the stellar mass , radius , @xmath7 , and the angular index of oscillations @xmath9 that can estimate the fundamental frequencies with high accuracy .",
    "we adopt geometric units , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath13 in this paper .",
    "torsional oscillations are axial - type oscillations , which do not involve density variations . therefore , it is possible to estimate the frequencies with surgical precision even with the relativistic cowling approximation , where the metric perturbations are neglected during the oscillations .",
    "the restoring force of torsional oscillations is the shear stress due to the elasticity of neutron star matter .",
    "that is , the torsional oscillations are assumed to be excited only in the crust region of a neutron star , because the matter in the core region could behave as a fluid @xcite .",
    "this is an advantage in attempts to extract information of the crust region via the oscillation spectrum .",
    "in fact , there are many uncertainties in the eos for the core region , which have yet to be constrained from terrestrial nuclear experiments . however , due to the independence of the torsional oscillations from the core eos , one can directly discuss the relationship between the spectra of torsional oscillations and crust properties irrespective of any uncertainties in the core region .",
    "the neutron star models are constructed by integrating the well - known tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation together with the appropriate eos . in general , one obtains an equilibrium one - parameter family of neutron star models ( such as the central density or stellar mass ) by integrating the tov equation from the stellar center up to the stellar surface , if one adopts an eos expressing not only the crust ( low - density ) region but also the core ( high - density ) region . in this case , by definition , one can not avoid the uncertainties in the core region . additionally , the incorporation of the uncertainties in the core region would be inevitable , when one considers the stellar oscillations associated with the core region and/or the stellar magnetic fields penetrating the core region . on the other hand , if one only has an interest in properties of the crust region such uncertainties can be avoided by integrating the tov equation inward from the stellar surface to the crust basis @xcite .",
    "we remark that in this scheme one has to prepare two parameters i.e .",
    ", the stellar mass ( @xmath14 ) and radius ( @xmath15) to construct the neutron star crust models , which might be a weak point in the scheme with inward integration .    to construct the crust models , one needs to prepare the eos for the crust region .",
    "in particular , we adopt the phenomenological eos proposed by oyamatsu and iida @xcite as in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this phenomenological eos as oi - eos . with any eoss",
    ", the bulk energy per nucleon can be expanded around the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature as a function of baryon number density @xmath16 and neutron excess @xmath17 @xcite : @xmath18\\alpha^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] in this expansion , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath6 correspond to the saturation energy , saturation density , and incompressibility of the symmetric nuclear matter , while @xmath21 and @xmath7 are parameters associated with the nuclear symmetry energy , i.e. , @xmath21 is the symmetry energy at @xmath22 and @xmath7 is the so - called slope parameter of the symmetry energy . among these five parameters , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21",
    "are well constrained via terrestrial nuclear experiments due to the nature of the saturation property of nuclear matter .",
    "on the other hand , it is relatively more difficult to determine the remaining two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , because one has to obtain nuclear data in the wide range of densities around the saturation point .",
    "so , the oi - eos is designed to reproduce eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) in the limit of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where the values of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are optimized to recover the empirical nuclear data for stable nuclei for given values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we remark that one could fairly commonly examine the crust properties even with the phenomenological eos adopted here , because the density at the crust basis is only half of the saturation density up to at most the saturation density , whose properties can be described well by the saturation parameters .    at last , in order to construct the crust equilibrium models , we have to prepare four parameters , i.e. , two parameters for eoss ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and two parameters for neutron star models ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) . in particular , we consider the stellar models in the ranges of @xmath25 and @xmath26 km .",
    "we remark that these mass and radius ranges are a little narrow , compared to the observed and theoretical values @xcite . meanwhile , as in the previous studies @xcite , we adopt the parameter ranges @xmath27 mev and @xmath28 mev , which not only well reproduce the experimental data for stable nuclei but also effectively cover even extreme cases @xcite . in practice , in this paper we adopt the same eos parameters as those shown in table 1 in ref . @xcite .    the elasticity ( which is strongly associated with a restoring force of torsional oscillations ) is characterized by the shear modulus @xmath29 , which is principally determined by the lattice energy due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "since the nuclei in most parts of the crust region are generally considered to form a body - centered cubit lattice , in this paper we adopt the corresponding shear modulus , which was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the ion number density ( @xmath30 ) , charge number of the ion ( @xmath31 ) , and the radius of a wigner - seitz cell ( @xmath32 ) : @xmath33 it should be noted that this formula was derived in the limit of zero temperature of the shear modulus obtained from monte carlo calculations , where each nucleus is assumed to be a charged point particle @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the additional effects in the shear modulus are also taken into account , i.e. , the contribution of the lattice phonons @xcite , the modification due to the electron screening @xcite , and the possibility of changes of the effective shear modulus by considering randomly oriented polycrystalline matter @xcite .",
    "it seems that the modification due to the lattice phonons is negligible @xcite , while the effects of the electron screening and the randomly oriented polycrystalline matter can lead to @xmath2 and @xmath34 reductions of the shear modulus , respectively , which correspond to @xmath35 and @xmath36 reductions in torsional frequencies @xcite . in addition , here we consider the effective shear modulus for zero temperature , but the shear modulus given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu0 ] ) is a good approximation for neutron star temperatures below @xmath37 k @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper , we adopt the canonical formula [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu0 ] ) ] for the effective shear modulus .",
    "the frequencies of the crustal torsional oscillations can be determined by solving the eigenvalue problem .",
    "that is , one should integrate the perturbation equation derived by linearizing the equation of motion together with the appropriate boundary conditions imposed at the crust basis and stellar surface @xcite . the concrete perturbation equation and",
    "the boundary conditions can be seen in our previous studies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also incorporate the effect of neutron superfluidity on the torsional oscillations in the same way as in refs . @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is considered that the neutrons confined in the nuclei star drip out when the rest - mass density becomes more than @xmath38 g/@xmath4 , and that a portion of the dripped neutrons may act as a superfluid . in the calculations , we adopt the ratio of superfluid neutrons to the dripped neutrons based on the band calculations @xcite . according to the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a ratio is in the range of @xmath39 , depending on the density .",
    "in the newtonian case , it is known that the fundamental frequencies of crustal torsional oscillations with angular index @xmath9 , which are denoted by @xmath40 , are expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the typical shear velocity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath40 must depend on the crust eos .",
    "in fact , via the relativistic perturbation approach mentioned in sec . [ sec : ii ] , we have already shown that the fundamental frequencies for a given stellar mass and radius can be expressed as a function of @xmath7 almost independently of @xmath6 ( see fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are positive fitting constants that depend on the index @xmath9 and the stellar mass and radius @xcite .",
    "we remark that this fitting can estimate the frequencies of the fundamental torsional oscillations within a few percent except for the unrealistic case with a very small value of @xmath7 @xcite . in the previous studies",
    ", we also found the trend that the frequencies become small for larger stellar radii and more massive neutron star models .",
    "however , a practicable empirical formula for the frequencies of crustal torsional oscillations does not exist , in spite of several discussions about the relationship between the crust properties and frequencies of torsional oscillations .",
    "thus , we try to derive the empirical formula of @xmath40 as a function of not only @xmath7 but also @xmath9 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , which must be valuable in both the astrophysics and nuclear physics communities .",
    "first , we fit the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath9 . in fig . [",
    "fig : ci - m14r12 ] , we show the exact values of @xmath47 with various angular indices @xmath9 for the stellar model with @xmath48 and @xmath49 km , as a typical neutron star model .",
    "the fitting constants @xmath47 appear to be linear functions of @xmath9 .",
    "but , through a trial and error process , we find that the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath9 could be expressed better with functional forms , such as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are some constants for @xmath53 , 1 , and 2 that depend on the stellar mass and radius .",
    "we remark that , if we assume that @xmath47 is just a linear function of @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath54 , we can not express the dependence of @xmath55 on the stellar mass and radius very well , as discussed later . using the above functional forms , the relative deviation can be estimated by @xmath56 where @xmath47 and @xmath57 are the exact values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lt0 ] ) and the expected values from the fitting ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) or ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) , respectively , for each stellar model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] , we show the relative deviation calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) for the stellar model with @xmath48 and @xmath49 km , where the filled and open circles denote the values estimated with the fittings ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) . from this figure",
    ", one can observe that both fitting formulas work well .",
    "in particular , we can estimate the values of @xmath47 except for the case of @xmath58 with the fitting ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) or ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) within an accuracy of less than @xmath59 .",
    "even so , careful observation shows that the fitting ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) is better than eq .",

    "thus , in this paper we adopt the fitting ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) to express the dependence of @xmath9 .    ) with various angular indices @xmath9 for the neutron star model with @xmath48 and @xmath49 km .",

    "the crustal torsional oscillations directly reflect the crust properties of neutron stars . in practice , by identifying the observed frequencies of neutron stars with the crustal torsional oscillations , one might be able to extract information about the crustal properties . however , in practice , it is difficult to directly extract information from the observed frequencies , because the frequencies of crustal torsional oscillations generally depend on not only the crust eos but also the stellar mass and radius . in particular ,",
    "the core eos is also strongly associated with the determination of the stellar mass and radius , while there are still many uncertainties in the core eos depending on the nuclear models and/or the compositions .",
    "thus , in order to purely discuss the crustal torsional oscillations and avoid such uncertainties in the core eos , we constructed the curst equilibrium models by integrating from the stellar surface up to the crust basis , where we had to prepare two parameters , i.e. , the stellar mass and radius . as a result",
    ", we successfully derived the empirical formula expressing the fundamental frequencies of crustal torsional oscillations as a function of stellar mass ( @xmath14 ) , radius ( @xmath15 ) , the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy ( @xmath7 ) , and the angular index of the oscillations ( @xmath9 ) for @xmath25 , @xmath60 km , @xmath61 mev , and @xmath62 , which are almost independent of the incompressibility in the crust eos @xmath63 in the range of @xmath64 mev .",
    "additionally , we confirmed that by adopting the derived empirical formula one can estimate the frequencies with less than @xmath65 accuracy for @xmath58 and less than a few percent accuracy for @xmath66 . in this paper , we focused only on the fundamental oscillations , but one might be able to extract information about @xmath6 and the crust thickness via the overtones of crustal torsional oscillations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the overtones of crustal torsional oscillations are known to depend on the crust thickness as well as the stellar radius , while the crust thickness might be associated with not only @xmath7 but also @xmath6 , because the both parameters ( @xmath7 and @xmath6 ) correspond to a kind of stiffness of the eos . in any case , when discussing the overtones of crustal torsional oscillations one should take into account the effects of the so - called pasta phase between the crust region composed of spherical nuclei and the core region , which will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , due to the existence of magnetic fields ( which were neglected in this paper ) the stellar oscillation might be more complicated , where the crustal oscillations can be coupled with the magnetic oscillations .",
    "even so , the crustal oscillations could be almost independent of such effects , unless the strength of the magnetic field becomes grater than the critical strength , such as @xmath8 g @xcite .",
