    "the rapidly expanding field of cavity optomechanics studies the interaction between mechanical and optical degrees of freedom in an optical resonator .",
    "this coupling occurs as radiation pressure from the confined cavity light acts to move the cavity mirrors , causing a shift in the cavity resonance .",
    "the first experiments to observe this interaction were done as far back as 1970 by braginsky and coworkers @xcite . in this early work , the mirrors were relatively large suspended macroscopic objects . as early as 1996 it was suggested that similar systems could be fabricated on chip @xcite .",

    "when the mechanical oscillator s resonant frequency is much larger than the intrinsic loss rate of the cavity , sidebands in the optical cavity appear at the mechanical resonant frequency . in this",
    "so  called resolved sideband limit , one can perform sideband cooling of the mechanical oscillator by driving the cavity with a cooling laser tuned to the blue sideband @xcite . as an additional constraint ,",
    "when the optical cavity is strongly coupled to the mechanical resonator , such that the coupling rate is much greater than the intrinsic loss rates of the cavity and oscillator , quantum states can be exchanged between the cavity and mechanical modes @xcite . because the radiation pressure is so broadband , this ability to have strongly coupled systems can occur over a very large wavelength range .",
    "this fact has given rise to demonstrations of strong coupling and resolved sideband cooling in both the optical @xcite and microwave @xcite frequency ranges .",
    "this ability to strongly couple to both microwave and optical frequency cavities led to a proposal to use an optomechanical resonator as a wavelength convertor between quantum states of microwave and optical photons @xcite . here",
    "the authors suggested state  swapping by using a sequence of @xmath0 optomechanical pulses , analogous to how one would perform state  swapping in an atomic system .",
    "later proposals suggested that one could convert between microwave and optical frequencies by using an adiabatic dark state transfer scheme @xcite .",
    "while not converting between microwave and optical light , a recent experiment has demonstrated the use of a mechanical dark state to transfer quantum states between two optical cavities @xcite .",
    "alternative proposals for state swapping make use of the ability to entangle microwave and optical modes through a common optomechanical interface @xcite , enabling continuous variable teleportation protocols to be utilized for state transfer @xcite .",

    "a superconducting qubit s transition frequency is in the microwave regime @xcite , and recent advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics has created strongly coupled superconducting qubit and microwave resonators @xcite .",
    "the ability to coherently convert between microwave and optical frequencies should enable one to develop a distributed quantum system using superconducting qubits and optical fiber connections .",
    "in doing so , one would improve the scalability of superconducting qubits in that the size constraints of a cryogenic system would no longer place a hard constraint on the number of qubits that one could couple . this idea",

    "@xcite , generalizes to fiber coupled systems .",
    "we show that this could enable high  fidelity state transfer between microwave cavities through optical fibers enabling a route towards optical networking of superconducting qubits .",
    "the frequency conversion on each side of the transfer is done using an optomechanical resonator , simultaneously coupled to both optical and microwave cavities .",

    "[ fig : schematic ] . unlike recent proposals in refs .",
    "@xcite , the scheme outlined here considers a single mode fiber and the coupling of microwave photons to the optomechanical transducer ( omt ) rather than the direct coupling of a qubit to the omt .",
    "the use of a single mode fiber eliminates experimental complications that can prevent transfer of quantum states through the continuum @xcite except in very simple cases @xcite .",
    "our scheme is similar to stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , used in quantum optics to perform state transfer between ground states of atoms without populating the excited state . as in the atomic case ,",
    "our use of a dark state to perform the adiabatic passage reduces the effects of loss on the state transfer fidelity .",
    "we show , using analytical and numerical solutions , how one could perform such a transfer , and we calculate the transfer fidelities for a variety of input states .",
    "we predict that high - fidelity transfer is possible when 1 ) both the optical and microwave cavities are strongly coupled to the mechanical resonator , and 2 ) there is strong coupling between the optical cavities and the fiber .",
