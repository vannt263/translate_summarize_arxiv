    "neutrinos play an important role in the evolution of the universe . due to their large abundance -",
    "the neutrino density of the universe is about 330  @xmath5s/@xmath6 for all three flavours - neutrinos can affect the evolution of large scale structures depending on their mass .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments , have shown that neutrinos are massive , and set a lower limit of 40  mev / c@xmath1 @xcite on the largest neutrino mass .",
    "experiments investigating the kinematics of @xmath0-decay set an upper limit on the effective electron neutrino mass of 2.3  ev / c@xmath1 @xcite @xcite .",
    "the * * ka**rlsruhe * * tri**tium * * n**eutrino ( katrin ) experiment @xcite uses a model independent method to determine the mass of the electron anti - neutrino ( @xmath7 ) by investigating the kinematics of tritium @xmath0-decay . with a sensitivity of 200  mev / c@xmath1 on @xmath7",
    ", katrin has the potential to probe the mass range of @xmath7 where neutrinos have a significant influence on structure formation in the universe . in order to achieve this sensitivity , a background rate of less than 10@xmath2 counts per second ( cps ) close to the @xmath0-decay endpoint at 18.6  kev",
    "is required .",
    "the katrin setup ( see figure [ fig : katrin ] ) consists of a high luminosity windowless gaseous molecular tritium source ( wgts ) , a differential and cryogenic pumping system for tritium retention with super - conducting magnets for electron transport , and a tandem spectrometer section ( pre - spectrometer and main spectrometer ) for energy analysis , followed by a detector system for counting transmitted @xmath0-electrons .",
    "katrin is designed so that electrons in a magnetic flux tube of 191  tcm@xmath1 are guided adiabatically from the wgts to the detector system . in order to achieve the desired sensitivity",
    ", the wgts - in which tritium decays with an activity of about 10@xmath9  bq - needs to be stable on the 0.1  % level with respect to injection pressure and temperature , with an absolute temperature of about 30  k. the main spectrometer ( length 24  m , diameter 10  m ) , which works as a retarding electrostatic spectrometer of mac - e filter type @xcite , will have an energy resolution of 0.93  ev at the tritium endpoint ( 18.6  kev ) .",
    "for the high precision energy analysis , a 1  ppm stability is needed for the  kv retarding potential .",
    "defines the analyzing plane .",
    "the trajectories of a transmitted electron and a magnetically trapped electron are shown.,width=566 ]    in order to perform a high precision energy analysis of the @xmath0-decay electrons in the katrin experiment , the so - called mac - e filter technique is used , which is able to combine high luminosity with high energy resolution . in general , a mac - e filter consists of two solenoids that create a strong magnetic guiding field for electrons ( see figure [ fig : psmace ] ) .",
    "this magnetic field @xmath10 has a minimum @xmath11 between the coils and a maximum @xmath12 inside the centre of one coil . for adiabatic motion",
    "the orbital magnetic moment @xmath13 of electrons remains constant , so that their transversal energy component @xmath14 is transformed into longitudinal energy as they move towards @xmath11 .",
    "the actual energy analysis is done with an electrostatic retarding potential at @xmath11 , which is created by an electrode system operated on a variable scanning potential @xmath15 .",
    "thus , a mac - e filter acts as an integrating high pass filter with a finite energy resolution @xmath16 .",
    "the magnetic field of a mac - e filter provides an intrinsic protection against background created by electrically charged particles originating from the electrodes .",
    "however , if low energy electrons are produced inside the volume of a mac - e filter via ionization of residual gas molecules or radioactive decays , these electrons are accelerated by the retarding potential to the energy of the actual signal electrons .",
    "therefore , processes that create such electrons need to be prevented in order to achieve a low background level .",
    "the pre - spectrometer test setup @xcite @xcite acts as a prototype for the larger main spectrometer in order to test the vacuum concept and the new electromagnetic design of the katrin spectrometers .",
    "in addition , new technologies are tested and developed at the test setup , which will later be applied to katrin ( e.g. an active hv stabilization , data acquisition system and background suppression techniques ) .",
    "the test setup consists of the pre - spectrometer vessel , an ultra high vacuum recipient including an inner electrode system , two super - conducting solenoids ( max .",

    "the pre - spectrometer vessel is made of 10  mm thick stainless steel of type 316ln .",
    "it has a length of 3.38  m and an inner diameter of 1.68  m. two pump ports with a length of 1  m and a diameter of 0.5  m are welded to the vessel at 45@xmath17 and 90@xmath17 with respect to the vertical @xmath18-axis .",
    "the total volume of the pre - spectrometer vacuum chamber is 8.5  m@xmath19 .",
    "the pre - spectrometer vessel is electrically isolated from its surroundings and can be set to a maximum potential of -35  kv . inside the pre - spectrometer vessel there are three sets of conical axially symmetric inner electrodes ( upstream cone , wire , downstream cone , see figure [ fig : pselectrodes ] ) .",
    "the cone electrodes are made of full metal sheets and the central wire electrode is made of 240 wires of 0.5  mm diameter , mounted in the axial direction . at both ends , conical electrodes held at ground potential provide the counterpart for the retarding field .",
    "the mechanical vacuum system of the pre - spectrometer is attached to the 90@xmath17 pump port .",
    "it consists of a cascaded set of turbo - molecular pumps ( tmps ) with an effective pumping speed of 1000  l / s and a dry fore - pump .",
    "the main pumping speed for hydrogen is produced by a non - evaporable getter ( neg ) pump , installed inside the 45@xmath17 pump port , consisting of 90  m of saes st707 getter strips with an effective pumping speed of 25000  l / s .",
    "a pressure in the 10@xmath20  mbar range can be reached at room temperature @xcite after bake - out of the system at 200@xmath17c and activation of the getter at 350@xmath17c .      in order to detect electrons originating from the pre - spectrometer or the electron source , a large quadratic monolithic silicon pin diode @xcite ( sensitive area 16  cm@xmath1 ) , which is segmented into 8  @xmath21  8 individual quadratic pixels of equal area ,",
    "is attached on one side of the pre - spectrometer . to be able to cover any position within the flux tube , the detector is mounted on a manipulator that is movable in all three directions . at the default measurement position ,",
    "the detector is centered in the flux tube at a magnetic field of 3.4  t and covers 28.5  % of the flux tube .",
    "a customized system is used for data acquisition @xcite .",
    "in order to characterize the background behavior of the pre - spectrometer , several measurements at the design values of the magnetic field ( 4.5  t ) and electric potential of the outer vessel were performed @xcite .",
    "the inner electrodes were kept on -18.5  kv in order to take advantage of the electrostatic shielding of the wire electrode against low energetic background electrons originating from the walls of the pre - spectrometer vessel @xcite .",

    "the width of a time bin is 1000  s. the pixel distributions for the intervals with increased rates a to c are shown in figure [ fig : rings].,width=529 ]    ) , together with the ring radius resulting from a fit .",
    "the ring radius varies along the spectrometer as @xmath25 and is calculated to be 24  cm in the analyzing plane for ring c.,width=529 ]        figure [ fig : rate ] shows the count rate versus time at the detector in an energy interval between 15 and 21  kev for a 50  h background measurement at a pressure of 10@xmath26  mbar .",
    "most of the time the rate is close to the level of the intrinsic detector background of ( 6.3  @xmath22  0.2 )  @xmath23  10@xmath24  cps .",
    "however , elevated rates ( up to 250  @xmath23  10@xmath24  cps ) are observed , which last between @xmath415 and 120  min .",
    "the pixel distributions of three selected intervals of increased rate are shown in figure [ fig : rings ] ( a to c ) .",
    "these background counts are not distributed randomly on the detector , but form distinct ring patterns .",
    "the concentric rings have different radii , and the number of single detector counts belonging to one ring varies between 10 and about 2200 counts .",
    "the energy spectra of the ring events show peaks around 18.5  kev that correspond to the potential of the inner electrode system . from this",
    ", it can be concluded that low energetic electrons are produced in the volume of the pre - spectrometer , which are accelerated to 18.5  kev by the electrode potential as they follow the magnetic field lines towards the detector .",
    "the ring events are classified into four different event classes ( see table [ tab : eventclass ] ) , depending on the number of single counts at the detector during the time of elevated rate .",
    "only class _ i _ to _ iii _ events can be identified reliably as ring structures , while class _ 0 _ events contribute as a diffuse background component .",
    "the distribution of ring radii is shown in figure [ fig : distribution]a ) . the linear increase towards larger",
    "radii is consistent with the assumption that the starting points of ring events are distributed homogeneously inside the pre - spectrometer , because the volume element @xmath27 increases with @xmath28 .",
    "@lll event class & detector counts & primary energy + _ 0 _ & 1 .. 9 & 0.1  kev + _ i _ & 10 .. 50 & 1  kev + _ ii _ & 51 .. 500 & 10  kev + _ iii _ & 501 .. 5000 & 100  kev +    figure [ fig : distribution]b ) shows the time series of single detector counts in the detector belonging to one ring during a class _ iii _ event . after a sudden start , the rate stabilizes on an elevated level and further increases towards the end of the run . background measurements with artificially increased pressure ( @xmath29  mbar ) inside the pre - spectrometer - via the injection of high purity argon gas - showed that the rate of class _ i _ to _ iii _ events is independent of the pressure ( see figure [ fig : rate5to55h ] ) .",
    "however , the duration of a ring event is significantly reduced with increasing pressure , while the total number of counts remains virtually the same and thus , the count rate increases . for another measurement , the magnetic field",
    "was lowered to 2.5  % of the maximum field . in this configuration , no intervals of elevated count rate or ring structures",
    "were observed and an average background count rate of ( 11.8  @xmath22  0.2 ) @xmath23 10@xmath24  cps was measured .    , but with an increased pressure of @xmath29  mbar.,width=529 ]        from the measurements described above , it can be concluded that the observed events are due to ionization of residual gas molecules by magnetically trapped high energetic primary electrons .",
    "this effect has been observed first in the troitsk neutrino mass experiment @xcite .",
    "there it was due to tritium @xmath0-decay within the mac - e filter .",
    "this source of background has also been considered in the katrin design report @xcite , yielding an upper limit for the tolerable tritium density in the spectrometer .",
    "the effect was further investigated in the mac - e filter at the mainz neutrino mass experiment for the case of 17.8  kev conversion electrons from @xmath30kr , decaying inside the spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the motion of a magnetically trapped electron can be split into a cyclotron motion , an oscillation in @xmath31-direction caused by magnetic mirroring , and a magnetron drift ( see figure [ fig : simulation]a ) ) , which is a circular motion - with the spectrometer axis as centre - caused by the inhomogeneous axially symmetric magnetic field ( @xmath32 ) and by crossed electric and magnetic fields ( @xmath33 ) . via subsequent ionizations of residual gas molecules ,",
    "the primary electron creates low energetic secondary electrons that are accelerated by the spectrometer potential and guided via magnetic fields to the detector , where they contribute to the background .",
    "figure [ fig : simulation]b ) shows the result of a microscopic tracking simulation of a primary electron with an initial energy of 178  kev in the electric and magnetic field configuration of the pre - spectrometer , including scattering processes on hydrogen molecules .",
    "the simulated ring structure at the detector is very similar to the ones observed in measurements ( see figure [ fig : rings ] ) and can be explained by the magnetron motion of the primary electron .",
    "the fuzziness of the ring structure is due to the cyclotron motion of the primary electron and to the change of storage volume of the primary electron due to scattering processes .",
    "the simulation also reproduces the time structure of the ring events ( see figure [ fig : distribution]b ) ) .",
    "the increase of rate towards the end of the event can be explained by an increase in the cross section for the ionization of hydrogen molecules by the primary electron as its energy decreases over time .",
    "the measurements at higher pressure are also in good agreement with the simulations showing that the background events observed at the pre - spectrometer are most likely due to the storage of high energetic electrons with energies of the order of 1 to 100  kev .",
    "details about the simulations can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the question was where the high energetic , magnetically trapped electrons are coming from .",
    "it seemed unlikely that the electrons originate from the electrode surfaces because magnetic shielding should reflect them back to the electrodes .",
    "if this background originated from the electrodes it would also be expected that there are much more events at larger radii . however , the ring events seem to be distributed homogeneously",
    ". high energetic cosmic particles and photons can penetrate into the flux tube and could create high energetic electrons via interaction with residual gas molecules . however , those processes should depend on the pressure inside the pre - spectrometer , but increasing the pressure by a factor of 20 did not change the rate of class _ i _ to _ iii _ events ( see figure [ fig : rate5to55h ] ) .",
    "only one possibility remained , namely that high energetic electrons are created as a result of the decay of a radioactive gas inside the flux tube of the spectrometer .",
    "taking into account the natural abundance of radioactive isotopes , the most likely candidate was radon from the natural decay chains ( @xmath34rn , @xmath35rn and @xmath36rn , see table [ tab : radon ] ) .",
    ".radon isotopes from natural decay chains @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     the natural abundance of @xmath37th , @xmath38u and @xmath39u yields three different radioactive decay chains .",
    "each decay chain undergoes a sequence of nuclear decays until a stable lead ( pb ) nucleus is created and each decay chain produces its own , characteristic radon isotope ( see table [ tab : radon ] ) . the decay of radon releases different particles with differing energies , such as electrons , @xmath3-particle and photons .",
    "if a radon atom decays in the vacuum of the pre - spectrometer , the following issues need to be considered :    1 .",
    "@xmath40**-particle : * * the maximum energy of the emitted @xmath3-particle is between 5.5 and 6.8  mev ( see table [ tab : radon ] ) .",
    "+ due to its large mass ( compared to an electron ) and momentum the @xmath3-particle is practically not influenced by electric and magnetic fields within the pre - spectrometer and , thus , flies on a straight track until it hits the vessel s wall or an inner electrode .",
    "secondary electrons are produced as a result of the impact .",
    "however , these electrons are of less concern as they are shielded magnetically",
    "* po recoil : * radon decays almost exclusively into polonium .",
    "the recoil energy of po is in the range between 107 and 122  kev .",
    "+ the recoil po atom can remain a maximum of 12  @xmath41s inside the volume of the pre - spectrometer before it hits the vessel wall or an inner electrode . the probability that it decays during this time is less than 0.5  % .",
    "* shake - off electrons : * any nuclear transition that changes the charge @xmath42 or charge distribution within the inner shells of the atom is accompanied by a restructuring process of the atomic shells . in this process",
    ", electrons can be emitted . in case of rn decay up to ten or more",
    "( low energetic ) secondary electrons can be emitted @xcite .",
    "+ the low - energetic shake - off electrons contribute to the pre - spectrometer background as class _ 0 _ events .",
    "* auger and coster kronig electrons : * the @xmath3-particle emitted from the nucleus can interact with electrons of the atomic shell and eject them , thus creating a vacancy .",
    "the probability of this process increases with the atomic shell and is 3.1  % for the m shell in case of @xmath43po @xmath3-decay @xcite .",
    "the vacancy can be filled with electrons from a higher atomic shell number , and the released energy is emitted as x - ray fluorescence , auger electrons or coster - kronig electrons , with typical energies on the order of kev .",
    "+ these electrons have a chance of 80 to 90  % @xcite of being magnetically trapped inside the pre - spectrometer , and are responsible for the observed class _ i _ events . 5 .",
    "* conversion electrons : * if an @xmath3-decay goes to an excited state of the daughter nucleus , there are two competing processes of de - excitation : emission of @xmath44-rays and internal conversion . in case of internal conversion , the energy is transferred to an electron of the inner shells that then leaves the atom with typical energies of the order of 100  kev .",
    "the probability for internal conversion is about 3  % of each @xmath34rn decay , and electrons with 178  kev ( 1.27  % ) and 254  kev ( 0.74  % ) @xcite are most likely .",
    "+ because of the much larger magnetic field in the pre - spectrometer ( 16  mt at the analyzing plane ) - compared to previous experiments in mainz and troitsk - the probability of a conversion electron to be trapped inside the pre - spectrometer is close to 1 @xcite . due to their high energy ,",
    "conversion electrons have the potential to create thousands of secondary electrons .",
    "conversion electrons are therefore responsible for the observed class _ ii _ and _ iii _ events .",
    "@xmath45 * and x - rays : * excitations of the nuclei or vacancies in the atomic shell after the decay of radon yield @xmath44 and x - rays .",
    "+ @xmath44 and x - rays are not influenced by electric or magnetic fields and produce secondary electrons inside the vessel walls or inner electrodes , which are of less concern regarding background due to the magnetic shielding .",
    ".,width=566 ]    in order to test the hypothesis of a radon induced background in the pre - spectrometer and to determine the radon activity of different radon isotopes , measurements with different configurations of the vacuum system were performed .",
    "if a radon atom is released into the volume of the pre - spectrometer , it can either decay there or be pumped out by the tmps .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath46 of a radon decay inside the pre - spectrometer depends on the lifetime of the radon isotope @xmath47 , the pumping speed @xmath48 and the volume @xmath49  =  8.5  m@xmath50 of the vacuum system :    @xmath51    @lllll configuration & @xmath48 [ l / s ] & @xmath34rn [ % ] & @xmath35rn [ % ] & @xmath36rn [ % ] + a ( e ) & 194 & 88.5 & 35.3 & 9.2 @xmath23 10@xmath24 + b ( e+l ) & 402 & 78.7 & 20.8 & 4.4 @xmath23 10@xmath24 + c ( l ) & 208 & 87.7 & 33.8 & 8.6 @xmath23 10@xmath24 + d ( 0 ) & 9.2 & 99.5 & 96.9 & 2.2 +    the decay probabilities of different radon isotopes for different pumping speeds are shown in table [ tab : rndecayprob ] .",

    "@xmath35rn emanation of the neg material is not taken into account because @xmath44-ray spectroscopy measurements of the neg material showed that the activity of the @xmath35rn decay chain is two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath34rn decay chain activity ( 4.4  bq / kg ) .",
    "the observed class _ i _ count rates can be parameterized as a set of linear equations of the form : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the rate of class _ i _ events for measurement @xmath58 ( * a * to * d * ) , @xmath59 is the radon activity of one of the three contributions ( see above ) , @xmath60 is the decay probability inside the pre - spectrometer ( see table [ tab : rndecayprob ] ) and @xmath61 is the probability that an auger or koster cronig electron is released in the radon decay .",
