    "when antiproton enters a matter it is slowed down and captured eventually by atom forming an antiprotonic atom . from the general point of view this new physical object is of the great interest . for the long time",
    "the experimental methods to investigate antiprotonic atoms have been limited by studying their x - ray radiation and the products of antiproton annihilation at the end of cascade transitions . however , about 15 years ago the investigations of these atoms have got on the new qualitative level especially due to the new experimental methods ( see @xcite and references therein ) that used antiprotonic beam from storing ring of lear operated in cern up to 1996 .",
    "new setup ad ( `` antiproton decelerator '' ) that has been operating since the end of 2001 opens , in definite aspects , even more possibilities for experimental study of antiprotonic atoms .",
    "in particular , in the frame of asacusa project @xcite it is supposed , among other experiments , direct observation and investigation of antiprotonic atoms formation in very rarefied gases .",
    "the new experimental possibilities pose various problems of the theory of antiprotonic atoms that were not considered early because they seemed to be of little importance in the former experimental conditions .",
    "one of such problem could be an influence of external static electric field on the properties of antiprotonic atoms , especially antiprotonic hydrogen .",
    "static electric and magnetic fields can be generated by some parts of an experimental setup , therefore they have to be taken into account in precision measurements of the properties of excited @xmath5 atom .",
    "on other hand , a special choice of the fields could be used in order to obtain an additional information on the properties of antiprotonic atoms .    according to current concepts of the theory of exotic atom formation ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , the antiprotonic atoms are formed initially in highly exited states with principal quantum number @xmath6 and , predominantly , with large values of orbital angular momenta ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is a reduced mass of the @xmath9 - nucleus system in the units of electron mass ( so , for the formation in atomic hydrogen @xmath10 ) .",
    "when @xmath11 atom is formed in molecular hydrogen , the distribution over quantum number is more complicated , however the probability of population of the states with large @xmath12 and @xmath13 remains rather appreciable . among the highly excited states , specific interest can present circular orbits with @xmath14 and nearly - circular orbits . in isolated antiprotonic hydrogen atom these states can decay only by radiative e1-transition .",
    "radiative life time of hydrogen - like atom at large @xmath15 can be estimated by the equation @xcite @xmath16 that gives @xmath17s for the circular orbit with @xmath0 of antiprotonic hydrogen .",
    "this life time is of the same order of value as for antiprotonic helium metastable states @xcite , therefore the same high - precision method of laser - induced transition could be , in principle , applied for the study of energy structure and dynamics of the excited states of antiprotonic hydrogen .",
    "however , the @xmath5 atom , as compare with @xmath18 , may be less stable against atomic collisions and influence of external fields , because a most part of the @xmath11 states with a definite @xmath12 is degenerated in @xmath13 , contrary to antiprotonic helium . therefore theoretical study of the quenching effects on the long - lived states of antiprotonic hydrogen is important for the possible future experiments .",
    "one of the most important factors to quench long - lived states is the electric field arising in the processes of atomic collisions or as a results of the external conditions .",
    "the dynamical ( collisional ) stark effect in hadronic hydrogen atoms was discussed in the literature for a long time @xcite .",
    "however the influence of the external static electrical field , as far as we know , was not discussed in the literature , in spite of the seeming simplicity of this effect . in this paper",
    "we discuss the influence of electric field on the splitting and decay rates of highly - excited ( @xmath0 ) states of antiprotonic hydrogen atoms .",
    "the states with large quantum numbers @xmath19 of isolated antiprotonic hydrogen @xmath11 are long - lived , because annihilation in the states with @xmath20 is practically absent and , on other hand , these states have large radiative life times .",
    "however , if some external action forces transitions of the @xmath5 system to the states with low orbital angular momenta , then antiproton will annihilate quickly . in the problem under consideration an external action is produced by the static external electric field .",
    "formally this problem is formulated as follows .",
    "if the nuclear @xmath5-interaction is disregarded , all the states @xmath4 of antiprotonic hydrogen atom will be degenerated in @xmath13 . in the real system nuclear interaction",
    "is important in the states with low angular momenta and it produces the both shifts and annihilation widths of the levels , or , in other words , complex shifts @xmath21 the estimations show that these values at @xmath22 are important for @xmath23 and can be neglected for @xmath24 .",
    "so , the complex shifts remove the degeneration of the @xmath2 and @xmath25levels , whereas other levels remain to be degenerated .",
    "a dependence of the complex shifts on the principal quantum number can be obtained taking into account that the radius of annihilation region and of nuclear interaction is small as compare with a radius of the antiprotonic hydrogen atom .",
    "radial wave function of antiprotonic atom this region should have the simple form @xmath26 .",
    "it allows to express the dependence the complex shifts @xmath27 on @xmath12 in terms of the coefficients @xmath28 : @xmath29    the coefficients @xmath28 are estimated , as a rule , with the hydrogen - like wave functions that gives @xmath30 and similarly for @xmath31 . as the input data we have taken the following values for the energy shifts and widths @xcite : @xmath32 with these values we obtain from the eqs .",
    ", for the states with @xmath0 : @xmath33    total hamiltonian @xmath34 of the antiprotonic hydrogen atom in the external electric field can be written as a sum of two terms , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a diagonal matrix with elements @xmath37 the matrix of interaction of the atom with the electric field @xmath38 directed along @xmath39 axis has the form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , the quantities like @xmath42 are clebsh - gordan coefficients , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is a reduced mass of the @xmath45 system in the units of electron mass , and @xmath46 is the bohr radius of ordinary hydrogen atom .",
    "eigenvalues of the non - hermitian matrix give the complex energies of the @xmath47 states in the static electric field .",
    "the real parts of these energies are shifts of the levels from the unperturbed values and the imaginary parts are the annihilation widths with account for a mixing of the states with different @xmath13 due to electric field .",
    "the formulation of the problem , as given in the previous section , supposes that a mixing of the states with different @xmath13 at fixed @xmath12 is important , whereas a mixing of the states with different @xmath12 can be neglected .",
    "it means that our consideration has to be restricted by the field less than a critical value , at which non - diagonal matrix element @xmath48 is comparable with the distance between the levels with different @xmath12 .",
    "it is easy to estimate that for the levels with @xmath49 this critical value of the field is @xmath50 v / cm , that is far from real laboratory fields .",
    "it should be noted that in the problem under consideration there are also two other critical values of the field .",
    "the first one is the field that mixes effectively @xmath2 and @xmath3 states , and other one is that mixed @xmath3 and @xmath51 states , the latter being degenerated with all other @xmath4 states for @xmath52 . with the above - mentioned values of strong interaction shifts and annihilation widths of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states ,",
    "we estimate the corresponding critical fields as @xmath53 v / cm for a mixing of @xmath2 and @xmath3 at @xmath0 , and @xmath54 v / cm for a mixing of @xmath3 and @xmath51 states .",
    "we restrict our consideration by the fields up to 5000 v / cm , therefore only third critical value @xmath55 of the field is covered by these calculations .    for the further discussion of the obtained results let us remember also , that the problem of stark mixing in the degenerated ( without initial shifts and widths ) hydrogen - like system at the fixed @xmath12 has the exact solution in the parabolic coordinates @xcite .",
    "eigenstates of a such system are labeled by parabolic quantum numbers @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , the splitting of the levels is linear in electric field , whereas the coefficients @xmath58 of mixing of the states with different @xmath13 do not depend on the value of the field and can be expressed in terms of clebsh - gordan coefficients , @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "therefore the admixture of @xmath2-state to all parabolic states with @xmath63 should be @xmath64 , and the weights of the np - state in the parabolic states are @xmath65 at @xmath0 .",
    "these relationships could describe the effect of external field on antiprotonic hydrogen at very high values of the electric field ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "however for the realistic values of @xmath67 the influence of the field can not be predicted without calculations .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown on figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] - [ fig4 ] . on these figures",
    "the shifts @xmath68 and widths @xmath69 of the states are presented in the relative units of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are the maximum values of these quantities in the considered interval of electric fields ( @xmath72 v / cm ) .",
    "different types of dependencies of the shifts on the value @xmath38 of electric field are shown on figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] - [ fig2 ] for several levels with @xmath73 .",
    "the levels are labeled by the indexes @xmath13 that correspond to the quantum numbers of the states in the limit @xmath74 . with respect to the dependence of the shifts on @xmath38 ,",
    "the levels can be divided into two main types .",
    "the shifts are negative for @xmath75 and positive for @xmath76 , and in the both cases they rise in absolute value with increasing of the electric field . within the intermediate interval @xmath77",
    "the shifts are very small and change the signs .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that in this region the shifts are nonlinear in @xmath38 and , moreover , they behave themselves for the first sight unusually , showing a resonance - like behaviour at @xmath78 .",
    "however , the nature of a such behaviour is quite clear - this is a result of some crossing of the levels that takes place with a change of the values of electric field . for the levels with @xmath79 we observe a similar behaviour with @xmath38 .",

[ fig3 ] - [ fig4 ] depending on the value of electric field . for the states with @xmath88 and @xmath89 the widths grow with increasing of the electric field ,",
    "however in the aforementioned interval @xmath90 the widths depend on the field in a resonance - like manner .",
    "the reason of this phenomenon is the same as for the shifts , i.e. it is connected with the crossing of levels in the static electric field .    ;",

    "it is related with the large values of the self shift and width , or , in other words , with the fact that the value of @xmath38 is small as compare with critical field @xmath96 as estimated above .",
    "thus the obtained values of induced widths of all the states with @xmath97 are due to the influence of np - states in the considered interval of electric fields . at larger electric fields",
    "the contribution of @xmath2 states would be a more essential .",
    "in this paper we have made the analysis of the splitting and annihilation widths of the levels of antiprotonic hydrogen atom in the static external electric field .",
    "as compare with the theoretical case when all the levels are degenerated and the exact analytical solution of this problem exists , we meet here a more complicated situation .",
    "this complication is related with the strong interaction shifts and annihilation widths of @xmath2 and @xmath3 states participated in the mixing of @xmath4 levels of the antiprotonic atom .",
    "the results of the paper can be formulated as follows :    \\a ) due to mixing of different @xmath4 states ( @xmath98 ) with @xmath3 states at the value of electric field @xmath99 v / cm , all the states acquire the widths of order @xmath100 1/s .",
    "the relevant shifts for the most part of the states are linear in @xmath38 and have the order of value @xmath101 ev .",
    "\\b ) contribution of the @xmath2 state into the widths of other levels is negligible at the considered values of electric field ( @xmath102 v / cm ) , because the @xmath2 state is very distant in complex energy from all other levels and can be admixed to these states at @xmath103 v / cm . as a result",
    ", the main contribution to the widths of the mixed levels gives @xmath3 state .",
    "\\c ) for the states that are close to the point , where the sign of the shift is changed , the shifts and widths of exact states have a resonance - like dependence on the value of electric field .",
    "the resonance value of electric field is of the same order as critical value @xmath55 , which provides strong mixing of the @xmath3 state with other states ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is due to a crossing of the levels at some value of the electric field .",
