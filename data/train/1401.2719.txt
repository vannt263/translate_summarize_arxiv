    "wide - field surveys of the halo of the andromeda galaxy performed with 3-meter class telescopes designed with the ccd - mosaics led to the discoveries of many ultra - faint dwarf companions and low surface brightness ( lsb ) stellar streams @xcite . a similar survey of wide surroundings of another nearby giant spiral galaxy m 81 @xcite also demonstrated the presence around it of many dwarf satellites of very low surface brightness , sb@xmath0 .",
    "diffuse objects having a surface brightness of @xmath1% above the moonless night sky are usually indistinguishable on the photographic plates of sky surveys poss - i , poss - ii , eso - serc and reveal themselves only being resolved into stars .",
    "the brightness limit of sb@xmath2 is easily reachable for the telescopes designed with modern ccd mosaics under a long enough exposure time and accurate flat - fielding . because the surface brightness of a galaxy does not depend on its distance",
    ", a search for new very lsb objects can be successfully performed with a telescope of small diameter ( @xmath3 meter ) having a wide field of view .",
    "for instance , a deep image of a galaxy situated at a distance of 10 mpc , carried out with a @xmath1 mega - pixel camera under a resolution of @xmath4/pixel , covers with its field of view @xmath5 the sky region of @xmath6 kpc , comparable with the size of the halo of a giant galaxy .",
    "hereby , the image of a dwarf companion having a typical diameter of @xmath1 kpc ( or @xmath7 ) contains a number of resolution elements ( @xmath8 ) , which is sufficient to reliably detect the object .    according to the standard cosmological paradigm",
    ", luminous galaxies are building up from dwarf galaxies via their consecutive merging .",
    "due to this , the far periphery of nearby giant galaxies looks like a screen where one can see stellar streams as a result of dwarf galaxy merging , and a population of lsb dwarfs missed by the photographic sky surveys .",
    "these apparent considerations were set as a ground for different projects which directed astronomy amateurs , having small - gauge telescopes , to perform a systematic survey of the vicinities of nearby luminous galaxies .",
    "the efficiency of such a strategy was demonstrated by @xcite whose project `` dwarf galaxy survey with amateur telescopes = dgsat '' led to the discovery and study of tidal stellar streams around several nearby spiral galaxies .    a similar project , called tbg ( tief belichtete galaxien )",
    "was started by the german amateur association `` vereinigung der sternfreunde e.v . '' , which has several workgroups , the `` fachgruppe astrofotografie '' being one of them . in 2011",
    "this group started a project in collaboration with professional astronomers from the bochum university .",
    "the project is called tbg , which stands for the german expression `` tief belichtete galaxien '' ( meaning `` very long exposed galaxies '' ) .",
    "all the selected targets are the galaxies from the local volume .",
    "initially , the project s aim was to detect new stellar streams . as shown by the first results , the wide - field photography made by the team also allows to reveal other interesting details : the tidal interaction phenomena between galaxies , as well as the dwarf galaxies of very low surface brightness .",
    "meanwhile , the tbg team reached sb of @xmath2 , which is deeper than that of the sloan digital sky survey = sdss @xcite . in autumn 2013",
    "the tbg aims were redefined and the cooperation with professional astronomers was also exchanged . in terms of the public outreach , there will soon be a tbg website for the presentation of the team results",
    ". today the group of amateur astrophotographers counts about 30 members . the telescopes in use range from the small refractors ( 4 inch ) to the reflectors with apertures up to 44 inches .",
    "to get very deep and high quality image data , high - end off - the - shelf ccd cameras of well - known manufacturers are used .",
    "all the images are carefully calibrated by dark frame subtraction and flat field correction before the further processing is applied .",
    "the framework of the tbg group activities is conceived by peter riepe ( conceptional work ) and thorsten zilch ( organization ) .",
    "according to @xcite , a group of galaxies around ngc  4631 accounts 28 members with a wide range of absolute magnitudes @xmath9 from @xmath10 till @xmath11 .",
    "the group is characterized by the mean radial velocity of + 635 km / s in the rest frame of the local group , the velocity dispersion of 90 km / s , and the mean harmonic radius of 243 kpc .",
    "the total stellar mass of the group members amounts to @xmath12 ) = 11.12 , and the virial ( projected ) mass of the group is equal to @xmath13 , what is 72 times the stellar mass .",
    "the brightest group member is a spiral late - type galaxy ngc  4631 seen nearly edge - on . on its northern side ,",
    "an elliptical galaxy ngc  4627 is projected , and on the southern side at the separation of 32@xmath14 there is another bright late - type spiral galaxy ngc  4656 showing strong distortions of the disk shape .",
    "radburg - smith et al .",
    "( 2011 ) determined the distance to ngc  4631 as 7.38 mpc , via the tip of red giant branch using the acs camera aboard the hubble space telescope . with this distance ,",
    "ngc  4631 has a linear holmberg diameter of 33.7 kpc and an absolute magnitude of @xmath15 .",
    "the moderately wide interacting pair ngc  4631/4656 with the linear projected separation of 69 kpc was a subject of investigations by various authors .",
    "rand ( 1994 ) performed a 21-cm survey of the pair using the wsrt radio telescope with a resolution of @xmath16 and found four wide hi - tails .",
    "two of them extend from ngc  4631 towards ngc  4656 and two others are directed to the north and north - east from ngc  4631 . apart from them",
    ", a ring - like structure consisting of low - density hi - clouds was detected .",
    "these features look like a tidal bridge with tails created during a tight encounter of two spiral galaxies .",
    "judging from their projected separation and radial velocity difference of 55 km / s , this event happened @xmath1 gyr ago .",
    "@xcite imaged the ngc  4631/4656 pair with a narrow ( @xmath17 ) filter centered on the balmer @xmath18 line .",
    "they found a broad field of faint @xmath18 emission , occupying a space between the pair components and also extending north from ngc  4631 .",
    "the discovery of a faint emission envelope around the pair has again confirmed the presence of rudimental tidal features remaining from the encounter .",
    "to test the own capabilities , the tbg members concentrated their initial photographic efforts on the already known objects , i.e. the objects imaged by the group of david martinez - delgado and his amateur astronomers @xcite . as the second step they decided to establish a new list of targets from the ngc / ic catalog by a systematic examination of potential candidates using the deep sky survey ( dss ) . to identify the possible candidates , a heavy contrast enhancement for all the images",
    "was applied . applying this method , some dozens of galaxies , showing suspicious features like possible stellar streams were selected . due to the limited magnitude of the dss ,",
    "the target candidates were compared with the sdss images , whenever available .",
    "the galaxy ngc  4631 turns out to be among the first targets in the project .            at first , a wide - field image of the galaxy was derived by dirk bautzmann . a diffuse feature 20 northwest from ngc  4631 unknown before was revealed .",
    "it is marked by the bars in figure 1 .",
    "then , bruno mattern from hamburg identified this feature on his deep wide - field frame obtained earlier .",
    "later , robert plzl and fabian neyer took follow - up images of this region . the stacked image of them is presented in figure 2 .",
    "the diffuse object was confirmed again .",
    "we called it n4631dw1 . about 5 north of the ngc  4631 core and 3 north - north - east of ngc  4627 ,",
    "another diffuse object was found , smaller in size and likely an extremely faint dwarf galaxy , called n4631dw2 .",
    "about 10 south - east of the ngc  4631 centre , yet a third faint object is visible , n4631dw3 , looking like a dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "at least , on the opposite side of ngc  4631 , compared to n4631dw1 , a larger structure of extremely low surface brightness can be recognized just south of the n4631dw3 object . this elongated feature seems to point in the direction of ngc  4656 , situated in the zone of the hi and @xmath18 bridge , found by @xcite and @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 presents some basic properties of the objects , assuming their apparent membership in the ngc  4631 group : ( 1 )  the object name , ( 2 )  equatorial coordinates for the epoch ( j2000.0 ) , ( 3 )  angular diameter in arcmin , ( 4 )  axial ratio , ( 5 )  total blue magnitude as estimated by eye - ball , ( 6 )  absolute magnitude , ( 7 )  magnitude in the far ultraviolet band acquired by the galex ( http://galex / stsci.edu / galexview/ ) , which is useful under the morphological classification of the objects , ( 8)  morphological type of the dwarf : ir  irregular , sph  spheroidal .",
    "as follows from these data , all three new dwarf galaxies have luminosities typical for the dwarfs of the local group and other nearby groups . under the scale of @xmath19 kpc , linear diameters of the new objects are also similar to the dwarf population of the nearby groups .",
    "we do not list the extremely lsb structure , called the  bridge  among the dwarfs as its large linear dimensions , @xmath20 kpc , are unusual for the known dwarf systems .",
    "as was noted by @xcite , a significant part of dwarf satellites around the andromeda galaxy and the milky way are situated in flat disk - like structures .",
    "the origin of these planar structures is usually explained as a result of tidal interactions between the luminous galaxies , whose tails and bridges are transformed after the fragmentation into ordinary dwarfs . in the case of an interacting pair ngc  4631/4656",
    ", three lsb dwarf galaxies discovered , along with the diffuse ",
    "bridge `` structure form a filament ( or a planar system seen edge - on ) that extends over 100 kpc .",
    "this is just one more example illustrating the idea that ' ' tidal dwarfs  may be making up a noticeable fraction in the dwarf galaxy population .",
    "herein , @xcite stress the following piquancy : tidal dwarfs principally differ from the ordinary ( relic ) dwarfs , because the luminous matter , rather than the dark matter is their dominating component .",
    "considering suites of dwarf galaxies around the nearby luminous galaxies , @xcite noticed that the number of dwarf companions tightly correlates with the luminosity ( mass ) of the principal galaxy . among the objects of the `` updated nearby galaxy catalog '' by @xcite , most of the galaxies with absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath21 possess dwarf companions .",
    "there are about 100 bright enough galaxies in this catalog , whose surroundings are still poorly investigated .",
    "a systematic search of low - contrast signs of interaction and lsb companions around them using the deep exposures at the amateur telescopes is an important and actual task of the extragalactic astronomy ."
