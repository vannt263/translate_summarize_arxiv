    "the slope of the relation tells us about star formation efficiency as a function of stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic scatter of the log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) relation is predicted to be due to variations in the gas accretion histories of different galaxies @xcite and indicates the level of burstiness in star formation history .",
    "the common physical interpretation of the tightness of the sfr-@xmath0 relation is that the bulk of the stellar mass in star - forming galaxies is built in a relatively steady process , as opposed to a rapid starburst mode , as occurs in major mergers .",
    "the merger - driven starburst galaxies with high specific sfrs tend to lie above the main sequence relation @xcite and the quiescent galaxies that have little ongoing star formation , identified by their red near - infrared colors @xcite , populate a region below the sequence @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the majority of galaxies spend most of their lifetime on the main sequence @xcite .",
    "therefore , studying the parameters of the main sequence and comparing them with the galaxy formation models can shed light on our understanding of processes that govern galaxy evolution , such as stellar and agn feedback @xcite , gas accretion rates @xcite , and gas inflows and outflows @xcite .",
    "the sfr-@xmath0 relation can be used as a test for galaxy evolution simulations to see how well the simulations can reproduce the observed universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "determining the slope and intrinsic scatter of the log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) relation can be hindered by sample selection effects , the diagnostic used to infer the sfr , and the method used to correct observed sfr for dust attenuation ( for a summary see , * ? ? ?",
    "the uv - selected samples and the uv - inferred sfrs are biased against massive and dusty galaxies where the bulk of star formation is obscured and the uv slope is decoupled from extinction . moreover , as sed- and uv - based sfrs are dependent on the same stellar population models used to infer the stellar masses , the scatter in the log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) relation may be underestimated when using sed or uv based sfr tracers @xcite . in order to overcome this issue , and more robustly measure sfrs for dustier galaxies , some studies have used sfr(ir)+sfr(uv ) as a proxy for bolometric sfr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , estimating the sfr(ir ) based solely on _ spitzer_/mips 24@xmath9 m imaging has its shortcomings and could artificially tighten the main sequence if the scatter in l(ir ) at a given l(@xmath10 m ) luminosity is not taken into account ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we improve upon previous high - redshift studies by utilizing a representative sample of galaxies with measurements of the h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 emission lines .",

    "the steep slope in the simulations may also be caused by a lack of quenching feedback that causes a dearth of red star - forming galaxies at the high - mass end of the sfr-@xmath0 relation .",
    "the slope of the log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) is influenced by various observational and measurement effects that could explain discrepancies in the slopes reported in different observational studies .",
    "we demonstrated three of the main effects here : dust correction , sample biases , and stellar absorption correction ( the last one is specific to the emission line studies ) . correcting the h@xmath3 emission line with the sed inferred @xmath141 , with the assumption of the calzetti curve , leads to a log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) slope of close to unity . a bias against dusty galaxies with low specific sfrs , as might be the case for uv - selected samples , may also result in steeper slopes of the log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) relation .",
    "finally , we showed that the balmer absorption correction has a significant effect on the dust - corrected sfrs and not applying the correction to the balmer emission lines could lead to an overestimation of the log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) slope .",
    "the evolution of the slope , normalization , and the scatter of the log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) relation is essential to our understanding of the processes that govern galaxy growth during cosmic time .",
    "once the whole mosdef sample becomes available , we have access to a large sample of rest - frame optical spectra for galaxies at @xmath142 , which makes it possible to study the sfr-@xmath0 evolution in redshift , using instantaneous and accurately - measured sfrs in a representative sample . furthermore , incorporating ir data into our analysis will allow us for a more detailed comparison with the existing studies .",

    "<S> we present results on the star - formation rate ( sfr ) versus stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) relation ( i.e. , the `` main sequence '' ) among star - forming galaxies at 1.37@xmath1@xmath2@xmath12.61 using the mosfire deep evolution field ( mosdef ) survey . based on a sample of 261 galaxies with h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 spectroscopy , we have estimated robust dust - corrected instantaneous sfrs over a large range in @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we find that different assumptions for the dust correction , such as using the color - excess of the stellar continuum to correct the nebular lines , sample selection biases against red star - forming galaxies , and not accounting for balmer absorption can yield steeper slopes of the log(sfr)-log(@xmath0 ) relation . </S>",
    "<S> our sample is immune from these biases as it is rest - frame optically selected , h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 are corrected for balmer absorption , and the h@xmath3 luminosity is dust - corrected using the nebular color - excess computed from the balmer decrement . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter of the log(sfr(h@xmath3))-log(@xmath0 ) relation , after accounting for the measurement uncertainties , is 0.31dex at 2.1@xmath7@xmath2@xmath72.6 , which is 0.05dex larger than the scatter in log(sfr(uv))-log(@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on comparisons to a simulated sfr-@xmath0 relation with some intrinsic scatter , we argue that in the absence of direct measurements of galaxy - to - galaxy variations in the attenuation / extinction curves and the imf , one can not use the difference in the scatter of the sfr(h@xmath3)- and sfr(uv)-@xmath0 relations to constrain the stochasticity of star formation in high - redshift galaxies . </S>"
