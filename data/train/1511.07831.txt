    "the traditional definition of planetary habitability is the ability of a planet to maintain liquid water at its surface . for a planet to be of astrobiological interest",
    ", it must maintain habitability for timescales relevant for biological macroevolution ( at least tens of millions of years ) .",
    "earth has been able to maintain habitable conditions for most of the last four billion years despite the solar flux increasing by about 50% over that period @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for this is the silicate - weathering feedback , which would regulate the atmospheric co@xmath0 in such a way as to maintain habitable conditions as other forcings , such as solar flux , varied @xcite .",
    "the silicate - weathering feedback is also essential for the standard habitable zone .",
    "the standard habitable zone is defined as the circumstellar region where an earth - like planet ( having both land and ocean , volcanism , and a predominantly n@xmath0-co@xmath0-h@xmath0o atmosphere ) could maintain habitable conditions , assuming the functioning of the silicate - weathering feedback @xcite .",
    "recent work has pointed out that planets outside of the standard habitable zone with thick h@xmath0 atmospheres could maintain surface liquid water due to the greenhouse effect of h@xmath0-h@xmath0 collision - induced absorption @xcite .",
    "this is noteworthy because many terrestrial planets larger than earth ( super - earths ) have been detected , and calculations suggest that they could retain an h@xmath0 atmosphere ( against escape to space ) for billions of years .",
    "potential biosignatures on this type of planet have already been investigated @xcite .",
    "the habitability of such a planet , however , would be transient or accidental in the absence of some stabilizing feedback @xcite , rendering such planets significantly less interesting places to search for life .",
    "@xcite notes that the reducing atmosphere of an h@xmath0-greenhouse planet would produce pre - biotic compounds that would favor the origin of life and speculates that this life could evolve mechanisms to regulate the h@xmath0 pressure and maintain habitable surface conditions .",
    "this is in contrast with @xcite , who write that the evolution of life on an h@xmath0-greenhouse planet would likely lead to the consumption of h@xmath0 and the destruction of the atmosphere ( and habitability ) .",
    "a factor that could affect this conclusion of @xcite is that it seems likely that the destruction of h@xmath0 , which supports the conditions that allow life , by life itself would inherently be self - limiting .",
    "the arguments in this letter will be built around this idea .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to propose specific biological feedbacks that could maintain habitable conditions on a planet with an h@xmath0-dominated atmosphere and greenhouse warming provided primarily by h@xmath0-h@xmath0 collision - induced absorption .",
    "such feedbacks would allow the habitable zone for this type of planet to extend to very large distances from its host star , greatly expanding the list of attractive candidates for biosignature searches .",
    "this work is speculative , yet i think worthwhile because i approach it by making a minimum of reasonable assumptions and following them to their logical conclusion .",
    "i will begin by outlining the critical assumptions made in this letter ( section  [ sec : assumptions ] ) .",
    "next i will show how a stabilizing feedback would work on planets with a net source of h@xmath0 from the interior to the atmosphere ( section  [ sec : source ] ) and on planets with a net loss of h@xmath0 to space ( section  [ sec : sink ] ) .",
    "finally , i will discuss these results ( section  [ sec : discussion ] ) and conclude ( section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "the most important assumption i will make is that biological processes are temperature - dependent such that there is a maximum rate of functioning at some temperature ( and consequently functioning decreases at temperatures above or below this temperature , figure  [ fig : function ] ) .",
    "this assumption describes the behavior of many terrestrial biological systems , and it is difficult to think of a realistic biological system that would not obey it .",
    "an illustrative functional form that describes this type of temperature dependence is @xmath1}{(t_2-t_1)^2 } ,    \\label{eq : temp - dep}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the rate of functioning ( which will correspond to production or destruction of h@xmath0 in this letter ) , @xmath3 is a base functioning rate dependent on factors such as nutrient availability , @xmath4 is the minimum temperature for the biological function , and @xmath5 is the maximum temperature for the biological function .",
    "i will assume that the biological function does not operate outside of the temperature range @xmath6 .",
    "i will also assume that we are considering planets distant enough from their host star that they have a very low emission temperature ( 60k or lower ) .",
    "in such cases h@xmath0 is optically thick near the radiating temperature , and other greenhouse gases such as co@xmath0 , ch@xmath7 , and h@xmath0o are effectively not present at that atmospheric pressure because their vapor pressure is too low @xcite .",
    "these gases therefore can not affect the outgoing longwave radiation .",
    "it is a reasonable approximation to take the adiabatic lapse rate as independent of these minor constituents , so that h@xmath0 is the only greenhouse gas relevant for determining the surface temperature .",
    "i will first consider planets with a net source of hydrogen from their interior , either from direct outgassing or as a result of serpentinization .",
    "one example would be an earth - like planet with a large hydrogen envelope in interstellar space @xcite .",
    "if such a planet has the right amount of h@xmath0 for liquid water on its surface , then life can evolve on it .",
    "one likely option is that methanogenic life ( henceforth methanogens ) will take advantage of available h@xmath0 through a reaction such as @xmath8 consuming h@xmath0 in the process .",
    "the co@xmath0 in equation  ( [ eq : methanogen ] ) could be outgassed from the interior if it is relatively oxidized , or it could be left over from formation .",
    "it is also possible that life could reduce some element other than carbon to obtain energy .",
    "what is important is that h@xmath0 is consumed during the process .",
    "if we assume that these methanogens function with a temperature dependence given by equation  ( [ eq : temp - dep ] ) , then we can write the following equation for the time derivative of the hydrogen pressure @xmath9}{(t_2-t_1)^2 } ,    \\label{eq : pressure1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the background source rate of h@xmath0 from the interior , and @xmath11 is the scale of h@xmath0 consumption by methanogens , which is dependent on factors such as nutrient availability .",
    "i have inserted the factor of four in equation  ( [ eq : pressure1 ] ) for later mathematical convenience .",
    "the assumption that h@xmath0 is the only greenhouse gas that affects outgoing longwave radiation @xcite leads to an equation yielding the mean surface temperature as a function of the h@xmath0 pressure . following the fit to radiative calculations given in @xcite",
    ", i will use the following equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the planetary surface temperature , @xmath14 is the planetary albedo , @xmath15 is the stellar constant , @xmath16 is the geothermal heat flux , and @xmath17 is a constant that is defined slightly differently here than in @xcite . for an earth - gravity planet ,",
    "@xmath18  w  m@xmath19  k@xmath20  pa . the exponent of @xmath21 in equation  ( [ eq : climate ] ) is actually slightly different from negative one .",
    "i approximate it as negative one because doing so simplifies the mathematics and does not change the qualitative behavior of the system .",
    "i assume that the planetary albedo is constant , which also does not change the qualitative behavior of the system since increasing @xmath21 leads to significantly more greenhouse warming than it increases rayleigh scattering @xcite , particularly for planets in distant orbits .",
    "let us define @xmath22 and assume that @xmath23 is constant on the timescale of biological adjustment of h@xmath0 ( we will revisit this assumption in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "we can then linearize equation  [ eq : climate ] around @xmath4 and take the time derivative to find that @xmath24 when @xmath25 . by combining equations  ( [ eq : pressure1 ] )  and  ( [ eq : dptodt ] ) , defining a nondimensional temperature @xmath26 , defining a nondimensional time @xmath27 , and defining a nondimensional hydrogen outgassing rate @xmath28",
    ", we find the following nondimensional equation for surface temperature of the planet @xmath29 when @xmath30 , equation  ( [ eq : nondim1 ] ) has two steady - state solutions ( fixed points , figure  [ fig : hab_ode_plot1 ] ) .",
    "the solution with @xmath31 is stable and the solution with @xmath32 is unstable .",
    "the stable solution is associated with the increase in methanogenic h@xmath0 consumption with temperature at low temperatures ( figure  [ fig : function ] ) .",
    "if some perturbation increases the planetary temperature from its equilibrium value , methanogens consume h@xmath0 more efficiently ( reducing the greenhouse effect and cooling the planet ) and decrease the temperature back to its stable steady - state value . by this mechanism",
    "an h@xmath0-greenhouse planet with a net source of hydrogen from its interior can maintain climate stability against changes in the stellar flux or geothermal heat flux on geological timescales if methanogens have evolved on it .",
    "if @xmath33 is increased above one , a bifurcation occurs and the system no longer has any fixed points .",
    "instead , the temperature increases indefinitely .",
    "this corresponds to a hydrogen outgassing rate so high that methanogens can not consume h@xmath0 fast enough to allow a stable steady - state climate .",
    "such a situation could perhaps be due to nutrient limitation of the methanogen population .",
    "let us now consider a planet with a net loss of hydrogen to space .",
    "one example might be a distant h@xmath0-greenhouse planet orbiting an active young star .",
    "let us assume that as the surface conditions evolve on our hypothetical planet as a result of h@xmath0 loss to space , habitable conditions are reached , and life evolves @xcite .",
    "some h@xmath0-greenhouse planets could have enough photosynthetically active radiation reach their surface to sustain photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "let us assume that a biosphere evolves on the planet that is capable of producing biomass through photosynthesis that releases h@xmath0 as a byproduct .",
    "the following reaction is one example of this type of photosynthesis @xmath34 where `` ch@xmath0o '' likely represents more complex organic molecules on which carbon has a net oxidation state of zero . on this reduced planet photosynthesis",
    "would use solar energy to oxidize carbon and produce biomass .",
    "it is also possible that methanogens would evolve that would consume h@xmath0 through equation  ( [ eq : methanogen ] ) or by running equation  ( [ eq : biomass ] ) backwards ( a reducing kind of respiration ) to obtain energy by reducing organic carbon , leading to cycling between h@xmath0 production and destruction .",
    "we can think of equation  ( [ eq : biomass ] ) as either the only relevant reaction , or we can imagine that it is the net effect of photosynthesis , methanogenic h@xmath0 consumption , and either the burial or other disposal of organic matter .",
    "since we are considering a habitable planet , it is reasonable to assume that there is abundant h@xmath0o on the surface .",
    "i will assume that ch@xmath7 is obtained from the planetary interior through outgassing , or potentially through serpentinization reactions if co@xmath0 is preferentially outgassed @xcite .",
    "the latter process uses h@xmath0 to create ch@xmath7 , so for the feedback i will describe to function it would have to create an overabundance of ch@xmath7 which equation  ( [ eq : biomass ] ) could then convert back to h@xmath0 as needed .",
    "following similar logic to that in section  [ sec : source ] , including assuming that biological production of h@xmath0 by equation  ( [ eq : biomass ] ) has a temperature dependence given by equation  ( [ eq : temp - dep ] ) , we can derive the following equation for the time derivative of the hydrogen pressure on such a planet @xmath35}{(t_2-t_1)^2 } - l_0 ,    \\label{eq : pressure}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the net loss of h@xmath0 to space unrelated to biological h@xmath0 production and @xmath10 is the scale of biological h@xmath0 production . @xmath11 is increased by thermal and hydrodynamic escape to space , large meteorite impacts that knock some atmosphere off the planet , and solar wind .",
    "@xmath11 is decreased by fluxes of h@xmath0 from the interior to the atmosphere as a result of direct outgassing and serpentinization .",
    "i will assume that @xmath11 does not depend on surface temperature .",
    "we can combine equation  ( [ eq : pressure ] ) with equation  ( [ eq : dptodt ] ) and nondimensionalize to find @xmath36 where @xmath26 is again the nondimensional temperature , @xmath37 is the nondimensional time , and @xmath38 in the nondimensional loss rate of hydrogen to space .    for @xmath39",
    "the system has two fixed points ( figure  [ fig : hab_ode_plot2 ] ) .",
    "the fixed point with @xmath32 is stable , which means that if the planet occupies this fixed point and is perturbed away from it , it will tend to return to its original temperature .",
    "this stable fixed point is associated with the loss of efficiency of biological h@xmath0 production at higher temperatures ( equation  [ eq : temp - dep ] ) .",
    "if the planet occupies this fixed point and some perturbation leads to an increase in surface temperature , the biological production of h@xmath0 will decrease , which will decrease the h@xmath0 pressure ( equation  ( [ eq : pressure ] ) ) and therefore decrease the surface temperature back toward its starting point ( equation  [ eq : climate ] ) . as long as the net loss of hydrogen to space is low enough ( @xmath39 ) ,",
    "the planet will be stable against secular perturbations ( e.g. , increases in stellar flux ) and random perturbations ( e.g. , random changes in outgassing that lead to changes in @xmath11 ) as long as they are small enough that the system is not perturbed beyond its unstable fixed point . if , however , the net loss of hydrogen to space becomes too large ( @xmath40 )",
    ", the system has no fixed points ( figure  [ fig : hab_ode_plot2 ] ) and the atmosphere simply collapses as a result of h@xmath0 escape to space , leading to permanent loss of habitability .",
    "this could result from either nutrient limitation of biological capacity , or an excessively high base rate of h@xmath0 loss to space .",
    "the model i have derived here assumes that biological functions can adjust h@xmath0 faster than the 10@xmath41 - 10@xmath42 year timescale that stellar and geothermal heat fluxes change .",
    "we will now examine this assumption . for a planet with a net hydrogen source from the interior ( section  [ sec : source ] )",
    ", the adjustment timescale is @xmath43 .",
    "let us assume that biological consumption of h@xmath0 is on the same scale as the interior flux ( @xmath44 ) and set the hydrogen outgassing rate to a reasonable value of @xmath45 h@xmath0 molecules cm@xmath19",
    "s@xmath47 @xcite , or @xmath48  pa  s@xmath47 for earth s gravity .",
    "let us also assume that the solar plus geothermal heat flux input ( @xmath23 ) is on the order of 1  w  m@xmath19 , @xmath4=300  k , and @xmath49=100  k. with these assumptions , we arrive at a timescale of @xmath50  years , or a couple orders of magnitude smaller than the timescale of changes in the forcings .",
    "the feedbacks discussed in this letter clearly will not work for every h@xmath0-greenhouse planet . among other issues , for some planets the chemistry will not be correct , and for others there will be limited amounts of necessary nutrients for biological functions .",
    "this is analogous to the habitability of terrestrial planets in the solar system , only one of which appears to posses stabilizing feedbacks capable of maintaining a habitable climate over long time periods .",
    "nevertheless , it is significant that stabilizing climate feedbacks on an h@xmath0-greenhouse planet result naturally merely from assuming the existence of life processes that either consume or produce h@xmath0 at a rate that has a maximum as a function of temperature .",
    "the key to detecting a stabilizing climate feedback on a planet with an h@xmath0-greenhouse planet would be to measure the h@xmath0 surface pressure ( a difficult task ) and compare it to what would be necessary to maintain a habitable surface temperature .",
    "if a single planet were found with the correct amount of h@xmath0 and some sort of biosignature @xcite , this would be weak evidence that a stabilizing climate feedback could exist on that planet .",
    "alternatively , if it is eventually found that an unexpectedly large number of h@xmath0-greenhouse planets orbiting far from their stars have the right amount of h@xmath0 to support habitable surface conditions , a statistical argument could be made that some sort of climate - stabilizing feedback ( potentially related to the ones described here ) exists on those planets .",
    "an interesting possibility is that an h@xmath0-greenhouse planet might actually exhibit both forms of climate stability discussed in this letter over its lifetime .",
    "for example , a planet might receive a high xuv flux from its star early in its life , causing significant h@xmath0 escape to space , and maintain climate stability through h@xmath0 production by life ( section  [ sec : sink ] ) .",
    "later as the star becomes less active , there might be a net source of h@xmath0 to the atmosphere from the interior , and the planet might maintain climate stability through h@xmath0 production by life ( section  [ sec : source ] ) .",
    "i have neglected many processes in this letter .",
    "this is appropriate in a letter that proposes a simple idea about a system for which there are currently few constraints .",
    "nevertheless , it might be interesting to extend this work including consideration of the effects of clouds and the effects of minor constituent gases on the atmospheric temperature profile .",
    "another issue that could be considered is how atmospheric chemistry would affect the feedbacks described here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although at distant orbits photochemical effects would be minimal . finally , more work could be done biological issues such as the specific nutrients that might be important to life on an h@xmath0-greenhouse planet and how entropic waste would be dealt with .",
    "i have shown that stabilizing climate feedbacks on h@xmath0-greenhouse planets in distant orbits result from the simple assumption of the existence of biological processes that either consume or produce h@xmath0 at a rate that has a maximum as a function of temperature . since",
    "this assumption is not restrictive , it is possible that such planets could remain habitable on geological timescales , making them more attractive candidates for biosignature searches .",
    "i hope this work encourages more thought on stabilizing feedbacks for the climate of distant planets with habitable conditions supported by h@xmath0 atmospheres .",
