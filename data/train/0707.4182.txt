    "the precise wavelength coverage depended somewhat on the location of the slitlet on the slitmask , but never exceeded 4390   at the low extremum or 1.1 @xmath56 m at the high extremum .",
    "no order - blocking filter was used ; since the targets were primarily selected to have red colors , second order light should not be of concern .",
    "most nights suffered from some cirrus ; relative flux calibration was achieved from observations of standard stars from @xcite observed during the same observing run .",
    "it should also be noted that the position angle of an observation was set by the desire to maximize the number of targets on a given slitmask , so observations were generally not made at the parallactic angle .",
    "we processed the two - dimensional data using the deep2 deimos pipelinecooper / deep / spec2d/ ] .",
    "we performed small ( 05 ) dithers between exposures on our initial observing run ; to reduce these data , we supplemented the deep2 deimos pipeline with additional home - grown routines .",
    "we extracted spectra with the iraf package @xcite using the optimal extraction algorithm @xcite , following standard slit spectroscopy procedures .",
    "prior experience with faint - object spectroscopy dictates that a small but significant error in the measured flux of faint continua may be introduced by sky subtraction during the processing of the two - dimensional spectra .",
    "we investigated this possibility with @xmath57 additional non - overlapping extractions in source - free regions in each two - dimensional spectrum , parallel to and along the same trace as the extraction of the neighboring -emitting galaxy .",
    "we then fitted these blank - sky spectra over the same region that we fitted for the continuum redward and blueward of the emission line in the object extraction . for 15 sources",
    ", these fits yielded a tiny residual signal , which we interpreted as a systematic error in the two - dimensional sky subtraction and applied as a correction to quantities derived from the object spectra .",
    "the typical correction was @xmath58 @xmath56jy , but the correction reached as high as @xmath59 @xmath56jy in three cases .",
    "sky - subtraction residuals of this kind generally resulted when a small spectroscopic slit contained a bright serendipitous detection in addition to the target , the combination of which made it difficult to fit the sky background .",
    "out of 97 spectroscopic candidates , we achieved 73 detections , 59 of which constitute  confirmations according to the criteria outlined below .",
    "a histogram of these confirmations appears in figure  [ z_hist ] , and a set of sample spectra are shown in figure  [ profiles ] .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of the  confirmations are summarized in table  [ table_spec_prop ] .",
    "one detected galaxy lacks an emission line but shows a large spectral discontinuity identified as the onset of foreground -forest absorption at @xmath60 .",
    "three of the detections are identifiably low - redshift interlopers ( two resolved  doublets at @xmath61 ; one complex of  and  at @xmath62 ) which survived the candidate selection thanks to their unusually high equivalent widths ( e.g. , @xmath63  ) . in ten cases ,",
    "we see a possible low signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath64 ) emission line located at the correct location in both wavelength space and physical position to be associated with the narrow - band selected target . however , even if these  detections \" are real , they can not be reliably identified as either  or as low - redshift interlopers .",
    "if these 10 cases were in fact low signal - to - noise ratio detections of  emission , then the  success rate \" of the keck / deimos campaign would be 72% , identical to that of the keck / lris sample described in paper i ( but also subject to all the caveats listed therein )",
    ". we do not include unconfirmed sources in any of the ensuing discussion .",
    "the remaining 24 targets were classified as nondetections .",
    "five of these slitlets suffered from some kind of instrument or reduction issue , e.g. , the target was dithered off the slitlet and so did not reproduce across the individual integrations , or irregularities in the machining of the slitmask resulted in defects in the data processing . of the final 19 nondetections ,",
    "13 targets were observed under adverse conditions ( e.g. , variable cloud coverage , and/or poor seeing ) for which the general spectroscopic yield was low . our failure to confirm these targets as @xmath0 -emitters should not be taken to bear on the efficacy of candidate selection .",
    "six nondetections were observed under photometric conditions with subarcsecond seeing for which the spectroscopic yield was otherwise high .",
    "however , subsequent inspection of the imaging revealed that five of these targets were suboptimal candidates for one of a variety of reasons : two candidates sit on weak satellite trail residuals ; one candidate appears in an initial epoch of imaging but not in subsequent epochs , suggesting that it is a variable source or a spurious detection ; two candidates are marginal or irregular detections in the imaging .",
    "this leaves just one otherwise viable candidate -emitter that was not confirmed in spectroscopy , even though the conditions for spectroscopy were favorable . since this source ( j1424398@xmath24353801 ) was a single - band detection in the narrow - band imaging , it is possible that it represents a spurious false - positive and not a genuine candidate",
    ". given the large number ( @xmath65 ) of independent resolution elements in the images , we expect about one false - positive at the @xmath66-level per lala field per narrow - band filter , and this number could be larger if the noise properties of the image are not precisely gaussian ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to estimate the reliability of our candidate selection , we consider only the foregoing six non - detections , the three low - redshift interlopers , and the 10 low signal - to - noise ratio detections as legitimate non - confirmations .",
    "this admittedly rough scheme suggests a rate of 59 detections out of 78 viable candidates observed spectroscopically under workable conditions , for a final selection reliability of @xmath1 .",
    "the rate of spectroscopic confirmation is plotted as a function of narrow - band flux in figure  [ abs_success_frac ] .",
    "we now assess our spectroscopic sensitivity to line emission .",
    "each one - dimensional spectrum was created with a variance - weighted optimal extraction @xcite from the two - dimensional data . for each object , we therefore have both the flux and the flux variance as a function of wavelength .",
    "we used the variance spectrum to estimate the uncertainties in quantities derived from the object spectra , e.g. , we sum the variance spectrum in quadrature over the wavelength range covered by the observed line profile to estimate the uncertainty in the measured line flux .",
    "however , the variance may also be used to measure the noise over wavelength ranges corresponding to any  line we _ might _ have detected given the redshift range permitted by our narrow - band imaging , roughly @xmath34 .",
    "accordingly , for each object we ranged over redshift and calculated the smallest emission line flux detectable : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the minimum signal - to - noise ratio necessary for a detection ( here taken to be 3 ) , @xmath69 is the grating dispersion ( 0.63   pix@xmath16 for the keck / deimos 600zd grating ) , and @xmath70 is the flux error in each pixel determined during the variance - weighted one - dimensional extraction , in units of @xmath71 .",
    "the limits @xmath72 and @xmath73 are defined by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the fiducial rest - frame full width of the emission line ( here taken to be 3  ) .",
    "we assembled the @xmath76 for each object into a grid and then ranked the @xmath77 at each redshift , resulting in the cumulative distribution of sensitivity to  emission line flux shown in figure [ spec_sens ] .",
    "the distribution may be interpreted as giving the probability that a putative  emission line of a given flux and a given redshift would have been detected in our spectroscopic campaign .",
    "since we cover a comparatively small redshift range centered essentially at the peak of the detector throughput , the sensitivity distribution is dominated entirely by night - sky emission lines rather than by instrumental effects . and",
    "since the original narrow - band survey was designed to probe relatively noise - free windows in night - sky emission , the spectroscopic sensitivity is fairly flat over the redshift range of interest . in sum ,",
    "the implied depth of our spectroscopic survey is 50% complete to @xmath78 , approximately 7 times deeper than the narrow - band imaging .",
    "note that because we derived this sensitivity function from the sample of spectra themselves , it depends entirely on the details governing the manner in which these spectra were obtained and processed , and is therefore valid for this survey only .      of course",
    ", given the detection of an emission line , the identification of that line as high - redshift  can remain problematic .",
    "thorough treatments of the pitfalls of one - line redshift identifications are given elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in surveys of the present kind ,",
    "the primary threat to the proper interpretation of a solo emission line is the potential for low - redshift , high - equivalent width  to survive candidate selection , and then to be misidentified as high - redshift  in later spectroscopy .",
    "however , at @xmath79 ( the redshift of an  line mistaken for  at @xmath23 ) , the redshifted separation between the individual lines of the  doublet ( rest wavelengths 3726   and 3729  , respectively ) is 5.4  .",
    "the doublet is therefore just resolved in our spectroscopy and serves to uniquely flag  interlopers ( figure [ oiifig ] ) ; this is an improvement afforded by keck / deimos over the spectroscopy presented in paper i. less frequently , high - equivalent width  survives as an interloper in our candidate selection .",
    "however ,  can typically be identified by neighboring  at one - third its strength , or by neighboring .    beyond merely eliminating plausible low - redshift interlopers",
    ", we may identify  emission by its characteristically asymmetric morphology , or by the presence of a continuum break if the continuum is sufficiently well - detected .",
    "each of our confirmed  detections demonstrates the asymmetric emission line profile characteristic of the line , where neutral hydrogen outflowing from an actively star - forming galaxy imposes a sharp blue cutoff and broad red wing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "each of the confirmed  emitters in this sample satisfies @xmath92 or @xmath93 , and 52 out of 59 sources satisfy both .",
    "as we found for the lower resolution keck / lris sample in paper i , the present  sample , observed with higher spectral resolution using keck / deimos , is systematically segregated from low - redshift  in @xmath85-@xmath88 space .    as a final diagnostic",
    ", we note that in each of our confirmed -emitters for which the continuum is sufficiently well - detected , the spectrum shows a continuum decrement consistent with the onset of absorption by the  forest at @xmath94  .",

    "we now update the characteristics of this population as they were estimated in paper i by investigating the distribution of the total sample in equivalent width .",

    "we first associated each measured line flux @xmath102 with a gaussian probability density function ( pdf ) centered on @xmath103 with width @xmath104 ; we proceeded similarly for the measured continuum fluxes .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for each galaxy ,",
    "is the volume over which of a given luminosity could be located and still be detected by our survey ; the luminosity function is then the sum of the inverse volumes of all galaxies in the given luminosity bins .",
    "our modifications to the @xmath133 method account for incompleteness in two senses .",
    "first , not every galaxy candidate identified in imaging was targeted in follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "following @xcite , figure  [ completeness ] shows the fraction of narrow - band selected candidate -emitters which were targeted for spectroscopy as a function of flux in the band in which the candidate was detected .",
    "we label this _ a priori _ completeness function ; the candidate  flux  can be roughly estimated from the flux in the narrow - band  with @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the width of the narrow - band filter and is the flux of the candidate in the @xmath41-band .",
    "second , even if a candidate -emitter was selected for spectroscopy , its inclusion in the luminosity function depends on the detection and identification of the  line .",
    "our spectroscopic sensitivity to emission as a function of flux and redshift is shown in figure  [ spec_sens ] ; we label this function . as discussed in section   [ sensitivity_sec ] ,  can be interpreted as the probability that a putative  emission line of a given flux and a given redshift would have been detected in our spectroscopic campaign .    in the presence of these selection effects",
    ", the available volume for a galaxy with  emission of flux  is @xmath136 where the comoving volume element in a solid angle @xmath137 and redshift interval @xmath138 is the familiar @xmath139 with @xmath140 in equation [ eq_vmax ] , @xmath141 is the solid angle covered by the lala survey , and  is the  line flux for the source in question if it were located at redshift @xmath48 .",
    "the lower limit of integration @xmath142 is set by the lowest wavelength at which  could be detected by our narrow - band filters , corresponding to @xmath143 . the upper limit of integration @xmath144 is set in one of two ways . if the  luminosity for a source is bright enough that the line remains above the survey flux limit out to the highest redshift accessible by our filter set , then @xmath144 is simply equal to the upper redshift limit for the survey , @xmath145 . for fainter sources ,",
    "@xmath144 is taken to be the redshift at which the flux falls below the survey flux limit ; in this case , @xmath146 .",
    "having computed  for each galaxy , we may compute the differential  luminosity function @xmath147 , the number density of galaxies per logarithmic interval in  luminosity . in a given luminosity bin of width @xmath148 centered on @xmath149 ,",
    "this is given by @xmath150 here , the index @xmath151 denotes the luminosity bin and @xmath152 denotes the galaxies within the bin , where the galaxies summed in a given bin are selected by their  luminosities according to @xmath153 finally , the uncertainty in the luminosity function may be estimated with @xmath154 = \\frac{1}{\\delta \\log l } \\left [ \\sum_j \\left ( \\frac{1}{{\\mbox{$v_{\\mbox{\\tiny max}}$}}_{,j } } \\right ) ^2 \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\ ; . \\label{variance}\\ ] ]    in figure  [ difflumfuncfig ] , we present the resulting differential  luminosity function at @xmath0",
    ". we also fit the data with a schechter function .",
    "if @xmath155 is the comoving number density of galaxies with luminosities in the range @xmath156 , then the corresponding schechter function is @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the normalization , @xmath159 is the characteristic break luminosity , and @xmath160 sets the slope at the faint end .",
    "this is related to the number density of galaxies in _ logarithmic _ intervals by @xmath161 and it is this function which we fit to our data . as in @xcite , because the binned data points are few , we choose to fix @xmath162 so as to fit with only two free parameters , @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "this choice fits well with the luminosity distribution of both lbgs and -emitters at @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "we find best - fit luminosity function paramters @xmath164erg s@xmath16 and @xmath165 mpc@xmath166 ( or equivalently , @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) .",
    "the error bars on @xmath159 and @xmath158 are the @xmath110 formal errors computed from the covariance matrix in the nonlinear least - squares fit , scaled by the measured value of @xmath169 .",
    "that is , @xmath170 , and similarly for @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "our @xmath132 sample provides one of the best measured  luminosity functions to date .",
    "we can study redshift evolution of the  luminosity function by comparing to results from the literature .",
    "recognizing that the uncertainties in @xmath159 and @xmath158 are strongly correlated , we examine not only the individual parameters but also the product @xmath172 , which is proportional to  luminosity density , and which generally has smaller uncertainties than the individual parameters . for our sample , @xmath173 .    at lower redshift ,",
    "there is a @xmath174 lf by @xcite , who fit all three parameters .",
    "they find @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 , whence @xmath178 . at the high redshift end",
    ", we compare to lfs at @xmath179 by @xcite and @xcite , and at @xmath180 by @xcite and @xcite , all derived by fixing the faint end slope @xmath181 and fitting @xmath159 and @xmath158 . at @xmath179 ,",
    "the lfs are similar to our @xmath23 result : @xcite find @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 , while @xcite find ( for their combined spectroscopic + photometric sample ) @xmath182 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 . at @xmath180 , @xcite find @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 , while @xcite find @xmath190 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 .",
    "the obvious differences between the lfs at each redshift may be caused by any combination of ( a ) simple uncertainty in deriving the lf from modest sized samples ; ( b ) field - to - field variations in  galaxy density ; or ( c ) differences in the methods used to derive schechter function parameters , and in part to local variations in  galaxy density .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite lfs are derived from larger total samples , but from a single survey field , while the @xcite lfs are based on a combination of several older , smaller samples from a few widely separated fields .",
    "regardless , if we take the difference between these various @xmath193 lfs as an empirical indication of total present uncertainties , the @xmath132 lf derived in the present paper supports a roughly constant  luminosity density over the range @xmath194 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result to the evolution of the rest - uv luminosity density and cosmic star formation rate density ( sfrd ) derived from lbgs over the same redshift range .",
    "estimates of the @xmath9 sfrd based on the great observatories origins deep survey / advanced camera for surveys ( goods / acs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the hubble ultra deep field @xcite show a factor of 1.56 drop between @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "what does this mean for the -selected galaxies ?",
    "@xcite report that -selection with an equivalent width criterion typical of narrow - band surveys would return 20%  25% of their @xmath163 lbgs .",
    "if -emitters are merely a subset of the lbg population which happen to have been detected during a stage of strong  production , than we would expect the  luminosity density to decline beyond @xmath195 , in step with the global star formation rate density . integrating the luminosity functions discussed in section  [ difflumfunc ] shows no compelling evidence for such a decline .",
    "though a modest decline can not be firmly ruled out , we may nontheless speculate that the -emitters as a population are evolving differently from the lbgs .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of  galaxies are typically lower than lyman break galaxies , and provide a hint that they are less massive .",
    "detailed spectral energy distribution fitting @xcite bears out this preliminary inference , showing typical masses of @xmath196 and ages @xmath197 to @xmath118 years .",
    "the correlation strengths of  galaxies and lbgs are similar @xcite , indicating similar masses of haloes . from the expected halo mass",
    "one can predict volume number density of  emitters . comparing the expected and observed number densities",
    "implies a duty cycle of -emission in the range 6%  50% @xcite . a similar duty cycle ,",
    "7.5% - 15% , is inferred from stellar population modelling of the photomeric sample @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of the @xmath198 quasars yielded the first detections of the long - awaited gunn - peterson trough , implying at least the end of reionization at @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) identified a large amplitude signal in the temperature - polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background @xcite indicating a large optical depth to thomson scattering and favoring reionization instead at @xmath200 .",
    "the wmap results are not necessarily inconsistent with those of the quasar gunn - peterson troughs . only a small neutral fraction ( @xmath201 ) is required to produce the gunn - peterson effect , so one plausible scenario is that reionization may have been an extended event , beginning early but not completing until @xmath199 .",
    "alternatively , a variety of theoretical models now suggest that reionization occurred twice , first at @xmath202 with the onset of zero - metallicity population iii stars , and then again by massive population ii stars formed after a partial recombination ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "high - redshift -emitting galaxies offer another perspective on this issue , as the visibility of  emission should be a sensitive function of the igm neutral fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite present first attempts to exploit this fact by comparing luminosity functions of -emitters at @xmath114 and @xmath203 .",
    "they find no measurable evolution between these epochs , from which they infer that the igm remains largely reionized from the local universe out to @xmath10 ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , applying the same test , find possible evidence for observed  lf differences between @xmath180 and @xmath204 at the factor of 2 level .",
    "they suggest neutral gas at @xmath205 as the explanation , though @xcite argue that the observations could equally well be explained by the ongoing growth of cosmic structure from @xmath179 to @xmath180 .    by using the  galaxy sample from @xcite",
    ", @xcite showed that at least 30% of the igm by volume is ionized at @xmath205 .",
    "this is corroborated by dark gap statistics in gp troughs @xcite .",
    "all the  tests of reionization assume that there is no intrinsic evolution in the  luminosity functions between @xmath180 and 6.5 . in this paper",
    "we show that there is little evolution in  luminosity function from @xmath206 to @xmath207 , thus strengthening the conclusion that the igm is not substantially neutral at @xmath179 .",
    "significantly , the related question of _ what _ is responsible for reionization remains at large .",
    "it has long been recognized that agn at early epochs are insufficient , owing to their rapid decline in space density at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on their analysis of the udf , @xcite conclude that the cosmic sfr in directly observed @xmath199 lbgs was roughly five times too low to reionize the universe . @xcite and",
    "@xcite argue that the ionizing photon budget is sufficient provided one accounts for sample incompleteness using a sufficiently steep slope at the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "@xcite argue that the ionizing flux density may be very inhomogeneous due to large scale structure , as seen in galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field , and that the directly observed galaxies at @xmath9 do produce sufficient photons for reionization in overdense regions .",
    "we estimate that the contribution to the cosmic sfr from -emitters at this epoch is lower than that of the lbgs ( @xmath208 @xmath115 yr@xmath16 mpc@xmath209 , as compared to @xmath210 @xmath115 yr@xmath16 mpc@xmath209 ) when integrated over the same limits .",
    "consequently , though high - redshift -emitters are proving to be a useful probe of the history of reionization , they are evidently not its cause . while extinction corrections could occasionally be large @xcite and could modify this conclusion , most well studied  galaxies have very modest extinction @xcite .",
    "when we compare the luminosity function of -emitters at @xmath211 to luminosity functions for similarly assembled samples spanning @xmath7 , we find no evidence for evolution over these epochs .",
    "this result bolsters the conclusion by @xcite and @xcite that the igm remains largely reionized from the local universe out to @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is somewhat at odds with the factor of 1.56 drop in the cosmic star formation rate density measured by @xcite between @xmath11 and @xmath12 in lyman - break galaxies selected in the exceptional imaging of the udf .",
    "it seems that these two populations  emitters and lyman break galaxies follow different evolutionary histories .",
    "the disentanglement of this issue will likely rely on extensive followup observations of large samples , so that we can study the continuum and absorption lines of many  galaxies , and conversely the  properties of the break - selected galaxies .",
