    "it is well - known that the dynamics of a suspension of dipolar particles is strongly influenced by the presence of an external field . concerning the viscosity of the suspension , its behaviour as a function of the magnetic field is monotonous in the case of a constant field , reaching a saturation limit where the magnetic moments are oriented along the field . in contrast , when the field oscillates that behaviour is considerably modified to the extent that the contribution of the oscillating field to the effective viscosity of the suspension may become negative for frequencies of the field larger than the local vorticity .",
    "this phenomenon observed experimentally in @xcite and reported in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite has been referred to as the `` negative '' viscosity effect in ferrofluids .",
    "it reveals the presence of two regimes , one essentially dissipative in which the variation of the viscosity is positive and other in which the energy of the oscillating field is practically transformed into kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "it is in this last regime where the variations of the viscosity become negative .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to present an explanation of that effect based on a fokker - planck dynamics describing the time evolution of the probability density for the orientation of the dipolar particle .",
    "the starting point is the formulation of that equation and its perturbative solution . in this way",

    "these figures clearly illustrate how for low intensities of the oscillating field the results obtained through numerical simulations can accurately be reproduced by linear response theory , as well as for higher values , linear response theory is still qualitatively correct . the crossover point from positive to negative values of the rotational viscosity seems not to depend significantly on the amplitude of the oscillating field .",
    "it is interesting to realize that , at high frequencies all the simulation curves match the linear response theory curve .",
    "thus , in this frequency regime linear response theory provides an accurate description of the phenomenon .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) also makes the non - newtonian character of the fluid manifest .",
    "notice that these effects are more pronounced for angular velocities of the fluid near the angular frequency of the applied field , i.e. , for high and low values of the vorticity the rotational viscosity goes to zero and a constant negative value , respectively , whereas for intermediate values it depends on the particular value of the vorticity . from both figures ,",
    "one concludes that the vorticity plays just the opposite role to the frequency of the field .",
    "in this paper we have presented a mesoscopic approach to explain the viscosity effect ocurring in suspensions of magnetic particles .",
    "the dynamics of the magnetic moment in the oscillating field is described by means of a fokker - planck equation which can be solved perturbatively .",
    "this equation gives rise to a hierarchy of equations@xcite for the different moments , describing the relaxation of the magnetic moment .",
    "the first equation of the hierarchy , when linearized in the field , agrees with the phenomenological equation obtained from non - equilibrium thermodynamics and the corresponding one postulated by shliomis .    following this procedure ,",
    "we have been able to compute the dissipated power and the viscosity which is a non - monotonous function of the frequency of the field . up to first order in the field",
    "our results agree with the corresponding ones of ref .",
    "@xcite based on the phenomenological equation proposed by shliomis .    the phenomenological approach , dealing with the phenomenological law derived from the entropy production , is strictely valid at small fields and is no longer correct when larger deviations from the equilibrium distribution occur . if we are interested in the response of the system to larger values of the field the correct approach is the one based upon the fokker - planck equation we have proposed in section ii .",
    "this approach involves the evolution equation for higher order moments of the probability distribution in the hierarchy . after introducing a decoupling approximation ,",
    "the solution for the first moment can be used to compute the energy dissipation that allows one to define an effective viscosity .    in order to go beyond the linear regime",
    "we have performed numerical simulations .",
    "this numerical analysis enables us to discern about the validity of the linear response theory treatment .",
    "our conclusion is that qualitatively linear response theory may provide a reasonably explanation of the phenomenon .",
