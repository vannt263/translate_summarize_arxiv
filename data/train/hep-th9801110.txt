    "since polchinski provided us with a powerfull @xmath1-model technique for studing non perturbative phenomena in string theory @xcite , a number of interesting relations between string theory , supergravity and super yang - mills theory have been understood .",
    "in particular , the already known family of solitonic p - brane solutions of type iia and iib supergravities in @xmath2 dimensions @xcite are recognized to be described , in the string theory framework , by d - branes .",
    "a number of fascinating issues like black holes entropy and non - perturbative properties of super yang - mills theory in diverse dimensions have been adressed in this context and partially answered , promoting d - branes and their dynamics @xcite to one of the most promising and interesting parts of string theory to be studied .",
    "in particular , using the boundary state formalism @xcite , many properties of d - branes have been efficiently studied both in the covariant @xcite and in the light - cone @xcite formalisms .    in this paper",
    "we are going to study some interesting aspects of the electromagnetic interactions between pairs of dual d - branes , which corresponds to the rr configuration of the exchanged closed superstring . in the boundary state formalism",
    ", one has to further consider the two possible gso signs , referred to as even and odd spin structure respectively .",
    "it is well known that the even spin structure encodes the standard interaction between two both electrically or both magnetically charged objects .",
    "we call this the diagonal interaction",
    ". an electrically charged object can also interact with a magnetically charged one .",
    "this interaction is more difficult to describe because the gauge potential fields can not be globally defined .",
    "we call it the off - diagonal interaction , which also occurs in the general case of two dyonic objects @xcite , carrying each both electric and magnetic charge ( beside it , they will also have the diagonal interaction , of course ) . a general theoretical framework for describing the off - diagonal interaction",
    "has been developed long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sect .",
    "ii , we review shortly this general framework , which is in fact very well suited for discussing the brane s interactions , and we will show that some recently derived results for dyons in various dimensions @xcite are naturally obtained within this scheme .    in sect .",
    "iii we show that the general results of sect .",
    "ii for the off - diagonal interaction are exactly reproduced in string theory within the boundary state formalism , by an expression of the amplitude in the rr configuration corresponding to the odd spin structure . according to the general framework",
    ", one has to consider the off - diagonal interaction of , say , one brane with a pair of a brane and an antibrane ( it is like having a dirac string between the two members of the pair ) . in sect",
    "iv we consider in particular the interesting case of the d3-brane of the type iib theory , which is self - dual in @xmath3 dimensions , that is both electrically and magnetically charged with respect to the self - dual rr 4-form present in the massless spectrum of the theory .",
    "we evaluate explicitly their diagonal and off - diagonal interactions . in sect .",
    "v , we consider a wrapped 3-brane @xcite in the interesting compactification over the @xmath0 orbifold @xcite , leading in @xmath4 dimensions to an @xmath5 effective supergravity theory @xcite . we show how the single electric and magnetic charge in ten dimensions is reinterpreted from the 4-dimensional non - compact spacetime point of view as a variety of possible dyonic charges , all satisfying dirac s quantization condition , depending on the orientation of the brane in the compact space .",
    "it is rather amusing to see how the odd spin structure string computation automatically encodes this feature .",
    "let us end this introduction by remembering that , from the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , the 3-brane on the @xmath0 orbifold does not couple to ( 4-dimensional ) scalars ; rather , it only couples to gravity and to the @xmath6 gauge field with equal strength , the total static diagonal interaction being zero , as appropriate for bps states .",
    "thus , being a source of equal strengh for gravity and maxwell fields , and nothing else , it looks like a reissner - nordstrm black hole in 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "as well kown , the electromagnetic potential generated by a magnetic monopole can not be defined everywhere ; in the case of a @xmath7-extended object in @xmath8 spacetime dimensions , there exists a dirac hyperstring on which the potential is singular . as a consequence , the phase shift of another",
    "electrically charged @xmath9-dimensional extended object along a closed trajectory in this monopole background , which would be a gauge - invariant quantity if the potential were well defined , suffers from an ambiguity . in fact , the requirement that the phase - shift should remain unchanged mod @xmath10 leads to the famous dirac quantization condition @xmath11 .",
    "it is possible to define a mod @xmath10 gauge - invariant phase shift also for open trajectories by considering a pair of charge and anti - charge instead of a single charge .",
    "since an anti - charge travelling forward in time is equivalent to a charge travelling backward , this system can in fact be considered as a single charge describing a closed trajectory .",
    "the phase - shift for such a setting in the monopole background is then a gauge - invariant quantity ( provided dirac s quantization condition holds ) . actually , this is the setting that can be most easily analyzed in the string theory framework , since it corresponds to d - branes moving with constant relative velocities .",
    "indeed the available techniques for computing explicitely branes interactions allow us to deal only with rectilinear trajectories , more in general with hyperplanes as world surfaces .",
    "the phase - shift for a system of a charge and an anti - charge moving along two parallel straight trajectories in a monopole background is a special case of the general analysis carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite that we shall briefly review",
    ".    we will consider dual pairs of branes , namely @xmath7-branes and @xmath12-branes ( with @xmath8 being the dimension of the corresponding spacetime ) .",
    "it is convenient to describe the interactions formally in the euclidean signature ( which can be then continued to the lorentz one ) .",
    "with such a metric one can consider closed world surfaces of the branes , as they would correspond , in lorentz spacetime , to brane - antibrane pairs , as explained above .",
    "the world surface @xmath13 of the p - brane is @xmath14-dimensional and it couples to the @xmath14-form gauge potential @xmath15 .",
    "we introduce the notation : _ _ ( p+1 ) a_(p+1 ) _ ( p+1)a_(p+1 ) .",
    "this can be rewritten as _ ( p+1 )",
    "a_(p+1)=_(p+2)f_(p+2 ) , where @xmath16 is the field strength @xmath17 and @xmath18 is an arbitrary @xmath19-dimensional surface whose boundary @xmath20 is @xmath13 . in formulae : _ ( p+2)a_(p+1)=_(p+2 ) a_(p+1)= _ ( p+1 ) a_(p+1 ) .",
    "the diagonal ( electric - electric and/or magnetic - magnetic ) interaction of two @xmath7-branes , whose world surfaces are @xmath21 and @xmath13 respectively , can be written as [ d ] i_d=(ee+gg)^_(p+2 ) p _",
    "( p+2)= ( ee+gg)^_(p+1 ) d _ ( p+1 ) , where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) are the electric ( magnetic ) charges carried by the two branes , @xmath24 is the propagator , that is the inverse of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in the euclidean path - integral , this interaction appears at the exponent , namely the integrand is @xmath28 .",
    "consider now what we call the off - diagonal interaction of two mutually dual branes , a @xmath7-brane and a @xmath12-brane , in @xmath29 dimensions ( the case @xmath30 is self dual ) : [ offd2 ] i_off - d= eg ^_(d-2-p ) _",
    "( p+2 ) + eg _ ( p+2 ) ^_(d-2-p ) . here",
    "@xmath31 means the hodge dual of a form @xmath16 , obtained by contracting its components with the antisymmetric tensor .",
    "it is crucial to observe that the hodge duality operation depends on the dimension @xmath32 of spacetime ( that we shall suppose to be even in any case ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath33 tensor satisfies @xmath34 and @xmath35 . using these properties",
    ", one can see that @xmath36 in the space of antisymmetric tensors , as it is equivalent to the hodge decomposition .",
    "therefore @xmath37 .",
    "now , the insertion of the @xmath38 between @xmath39 and @xmath18 yields a contact term given by their intersection number ; assuming by a `` dirac veto '' that this number is zero , we get @xmath40 . finally , transposing the second term in eq .",
    "( [ offd2 ] ) and using the above properties , we get finally [ offd ] i_off - d & = & ( eg + ( -1)^q eg ) ^_(d-2-p ) _ ( p+2 ) + & = & 12(eg + ( -1)^q eg ) ( ^_(d-2-p ) _",
    "( p+2)+(-1)^q _ ( p+2 ) ^_(d-2-p ) ) .",
    "in order for the path integral over @xmath41 to be well defined , it is necessary to impose the dirac quantization condition @xcite ( eg + ( -1)^q eg ) = 2 n .",
    "the point is that @xmath42 depends on the ( supposed irrelevant ) choice of the unphysical @xmath39 , which is only constrained to have the physical brane world surface @xmath43 as its boundary : @xmath44 .",
    "however , the path - integral integrand is in this case @xmath41 and this has no ambiguity . indeed , i_off - d=(2n ) ^_(d-2-p ) d _ ( p+1 ) .",
    "now , if we change @xmath39 keeping its boundary fixed , the ensuing change of @xmath42 can be written as @xmath45 , where the boundary of @xmath46 is the union of the old @xmath39 and the new one . by integrating by parts , using @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "since we consider closed world surfaces , we get i_off - d=(2n)v_(d-1-p)_(p+1 ) = 2 ( ) , since @xmath49 is the intersection number of the closed hypersurface @xmath13 and the hypervolume @xmath46 and is therefore an integer .",
    "notice that relaxing the dirac veto , eq .",
    "( [ offd ] ) is a consistent expression provided @xmath50 .",
    "the above properties remain valid also when we compactify some of the dimensions , in particular compactifying @xmath51 ( the directions @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) of the @xmath3 dimensions in string theory . objects whose extended dimensions are wrapped in the compactified directions will appear point - like in the 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "in particular , as anticipated , we will be interested in the sequel in the case of the @xmath54-brane , occuring in type iib string theory , compactified on the orbifold @xmath0 .",
    "the 3-brane of type iib is a special case since it is both electrically and magnetically charged with respect to the self - dual rr 4-form ; this peculiarity will be relevant in our study giving rise , both before and after the compactification , to a dyonically charged state . from the 4-dimensional spacetime point of view",
    ", this will look like the interaction of two dyons , whose values of electric and magnetic charges turn out to be dictated by the brane s different orientations in the compact directions .",
    "for instance , if the two ( off - diagonally ) interacting branes are parallel in the compact directions , then it is easy to see ( we will be explicit in the following ) that @xmath55 and this will be interpreted in @xmath4 dimensions by saying that there is no off - diagonal interaction between to `` parallel '' dyons , that is having the same ratio ( magnetic charge)/(electric charge ) .",
    "in fact , two such dyons behave with respect to each other as purely electrically charged particles .",
    "it is amusing to notice that although the dirac quantization condition is automatically implemented , as we said , once the off - diagonal interaction is correctly normalized in @xmath2 dimensions , it might look somewhat non - obvious at first sight in @xmath4 dimensions , due to the non - intuitive features of compact spaces .",
    "we will explore the ensuing pattern of charge quantization in the following sections .    in the following",
    ", we are going to consider the off - diagonal interaction of two pairs of 3-branes - antibranes , wrapped on the compact space and moving linearly in spacetime ( the brane s parameters will be labeled by @xmath56 , the antibrane s ones by @xmath57 and the index @xmath58 labels the two pairs ) .",
    "we will take the trajectories in spacetime to describe a line in the @xmath59 plane . in each of the two pairs ,",
    "the brane and the antibrane are parallel to each other .",
    "this means that each pair is described by two parallel @xmath4-dimensional hyperplanes , three directions being compact and specified by the angles @xmath60 ( @xmath53 ) , which are common to the brane and the antibrane , in each of the three tori which compose @xmath61 and one direction @xmath62 in the plane @xmath59 . in the lorentz spacetime ,",
    "the @xmath59 direction @xmath62 is specified by an hyperbolic angle , the rapidity @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the @xmath59 trajectory of the brane of the pair @xmath65 is taken in the positive @xmath66-direction and is located at position @xmath67 in the transverse @xmath68 plane , while the trajectory of the antibrane is taken in the negative @xmath66-direction and is located at position @xmath69 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a complex variable @xmath70 .",
    "the positions of the brane and the antibrane of the two pairs in the transverse @xmath68 plane is depicted in fig . 1",
    ".    epsf    * fig . 1 *    according to the general construction ,",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal interactions @xmath71 and @xmath42 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ d ] ) and ( [ offd ] ) respectively . in order to integrate along the hypersurfaces ,",
    "let us suppose first that the angles @xmath72 are different from the angles @xmath73 .",
    "consider then the fourier transform of @xmath74 and write @xmath75 .",
    "the integration along the planes in the compact space and along the @xmath59 plane will result in putting to zero all the compact and the @xmath59 components of the momentum @xmath76 .",
    "hence , after those integrations , the propagator @xmath24 will be reduced to the fourier transform of @xmath77 where only @xmath78 are different from zero , that is the two dimensional propagator @xmath79 in the plane @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the only possible derivatives occurring in the previous equation will be in the @xmath68 plane . actually , by doing the integration over @xmath80 as the last one",
    ", the other integrations factorize into the product of integrations along the planes @xmath59 ,",
    "@xmath68 and the three compact planes @xmath81 respectively .    in the diagonal case ,",
    "the integration in the @xmath59 plane gives @xmath82 where @xmath62 represents the direction of the @xmath65 branes trajectories in the @xmath59 plane .",
    "the integrations in the @xmath81 planes give instead , as we will see in sect .",
    "v , @xmath83 this factor ( times the 10-dimensional charges @xmath84 ) is interpreted in 4-dimensions as the dyon charge combination @xmath85 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the two - dimensional _ complex _ propagator , whose real part is @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is an infrared cut - off ) _ 2 ( , ^ ) = 12 .",
    "the remaining integrations in the @xmath68 plane are over the straight lines joining the brane in @xmath88 and the antibrane in @xmath89 for each of the two pairs @xmath58 , and give & & ( e^(1)e^(2)+g^(1)g^(2 ) ) _ ^(1)_b^^(1)_a d ^(1 ) _",
    "^(1 ) _ ^(2)_b^^(2)_a d ^(2 ) _",
    "^(2 ) _ 2 ( ^(1 ) , ^(2 ) ) = + & & = ( ) .    in the off - diagonal case",
    ", the integration in the @xmath59 plane gives @xmath90 the result is therefore @xmath91 ( the degenerate case where the trajectories @xmath92 and @xmath93 are parallel should be taken to be zero ) .",
    "the integrations in the @xmath81 planes give instead @xmath94 this factor ( times the 10-dimensional charges @xmath95 ) is interpreted in 4-dimensions as the dyon charge combination @xmath96 .",
    "the remaining integrations in the @xmath68 plane give in this case ( for @xmath97 ) & & ( e^(1)g^(2)-g^(1)e^(2 ) ) _ ^(1)_b^^(1)_a d ^(1 ) _",
    "^(1 ) _ ^(2)_b^^(2)_a d ^(2 ) _",
    "^(2 ) _ 2 ( ^(1 ) , ^(2 ) ) = + & & = ( ) + & & = - = - ( keeping the same sign convention for the angles , see fig .",
    "there are here two important observation that we can make .",
    "first , considering pairs of branes - antibranes automatically eliminates any infrared divergence .",
    "second , the off - diagonal interaction is given by the difference of the angles by which any curve joining @xmath98 and @xmath99 is seen from @xmath98 and @xmath99 , or viceversa .",
    "we thus see explicitely that @xmath42 is defined modulo @xmath100 .",
    "concluding , the total diagonal and off - diagonal interactions are given by i_d & = & _ 2 , + i_off - d & = & ( e^(1)g^(2)-g^(1)e^(2 ) ) _ 2 , with @xmath101    notice the interesting fact that in @xmath102 , where the gauge field is a @xmath103 even form , the 3-brane is a dyon in the sense that it has @xmath104 and that it has both a diagonal and an off - diagonal interaction with itself .",
    "in fact , the off - diagonal interaction is in this case proportional to @xmath105 ( whereas for q odd it is proportional to @xmath106 ) and different from zero also for @xmath107 , @xmath108 . on the contrary , for @xmath109 , where the gauge field is a @xmath110 odd form , two `` parallel '' dyons having @xmath107 and @xmath108 do not have any off - diagonal interaction , the latter beeing proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "it turns out from our analysis that the d=10 off - diagonal interaction , proportional to @xmath111 , becomes automatically proportional to @xmath112 upon compactification down to d=4 .",
    "this happens because the off - diagonal interaction is proportional to the factor @xmath113 , which is zero when the branes @xmath92 and @xmath93 are seen by a non - compact observer to be parallel in the sense that @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "all of this will be explicitly shown in sect . v. more in general ,",
    "notice that the off - diagonal interaction between two dyons @xmath92 and @xmath93 is symmetric both for @xmath9 even and for @xmath9 odd , under the exchange of every quantum number , @xmath114 .",
    "in fact , the transverse @xmath68 contribution to the amplitude , that is @xmath115 , is symmetric , @xmath116 , whereas each pair of the remaining non - transverse directions @xmath59 and @xmath81 gives an antisymmetric contribution ; therefore , since @xmath117 is symmetric for @xmath9 even and antisymmetric for @xmath9 odd , the total amplitude turns out to be symmetric in both cases ( see eq .",
    "( [ offd ] ) ) .",
    "as already noticed , the diagonal electric - electric and/or magnetic - magnetic interaction between two p - branes is a well defined quantity also for open trajectories . in this case ,",
    "in fact , there is no strict necessity of considering interactions among pairs of brane - antibrane ( although this is advisable to avoid infrared problems ) . in string theory ,",
    "the diagonal even interaction of just one brane at @xmath118 and one brane at @xmath119 is computed within the boundary state formalism to be @xcite _ d = _  even < v^(1),^(1)_a,^(1)|_0^ dl e^-lh |v^(2),^(2)_a,^(2 ) > _ , where @xmath120 is the boundary state representing the @xmath7-brane , @xmath121 is the closed superstring hamiltonian , @xmath122 is the rr charge of the p - brane and the factor @xmath123 comes from our conventional normalization .",
    "the even spin structure corresponding to the case @xmath124 ( meaning the rr closed superstring sector and the gso projection sign @xmath125 ) represents the diagonal electromagnetic interaction , whereas the two nsns spin structures @xmath126 represent the gravitational one .",
    "the main features of this diagonal amplitude are reviewed in sect .",
    "iv .    let us stress here that only the even spin structure contributes .",
    "in fact , in the odd spin structure case , even if the rapidity tilt @xmath127 and the angle tilt @xmath128 prevent the occurrence of fermionic zero modes in the directions @xmath59 and @xmath81 with @xmath53 , there still remain fermionic zero modes in the @xmath68 transverse directions .",
    "the amplitude therefore vanishes since there is no insertion of operators to soak up those zero modes .",
    "now we show that also the off - diagonal interaction can be expressed in string theory within the boundary state formalism . in this case , as we have seen , it is necessary to consider at least the interaction of a brane - antibrane pair , say located at @xmath129 , with one brane ( or antibrane ) located at @xmath119 .",
    "according to the previous general description , this interaction is expressed by an integral over a dirac string joining @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which we represent parametrically by @xmath132 , @xmath133 .",
    "the expression of the off - diagonal odd amplitude is the following : [ oddstr ] a_off - d=_0 ^ 1 ds < v^(1),^(1)_a,^(1)(s)|j(s)|j(s)_0^ dl e^-lh    that the braket is evaluated in the rr odd spin structure . here",
    "@xmath134 represent the left and right moving `` supercurrents '' : @xmath135 and @xmath136 . along the dirac string , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the normal derivative , that is along the direction @xmath139 orthogonal to the dirac string ; @xmath139 is therefore the ( euclidean ) world sheet evolution time of the closed superstring .",
    "the odd spin structure case is now different from zero due to the supercurrent insertion .",
    "in fact since the odd amplitude vanishes unless there is the proper fermionic zero modes insertion , only the part of the insertion containing @xmath140 ( or @xmath141 interchanged ) will contribute ( for this reason the result would be the same also inserting the complete supercurrent including also the ghost part ) .",
    "since the boundary conditions essentially identify @xmath142 and @xmath143 , we see that , due to the anticommuting properties of the fermionic coordinates , @xmath144 now , in the odd spin structure case the contribution of the fermionic and bosonic oscillator modes is equal to 1 , since the bosonic modes contribution is exactly the inverse of the fermionic modes one .",
    "moreover , only the non - oscillator part of the inserted supercurrents contributes : the fermions are necessarily zero modes as already explained and give an antisymmetric result ; consequently , we are left with an antisymmetric bosonic correlation which is zero except for the non - oscillator part .",
    "thus it remains only the non - oscillator modes , both bosonic and fermionic , contribution .",
    "the rest of the discussion now follows closely the general pattern described in sect .",
    "ii . the part of that contribution from the coordinates directions @xmath59 and @xmath81 with @xmath53 gives a position independent factor , which after compactification can be reinterpreted as the dyon charge combination @xmath145 . this",
    "will be explicitely discussed in sect .",
    "v. it is interesting to notice that the contribution of the fermionic non - oscillator modes is essential in providing the correct `` numerators '' in the resulting expressions .",
    "the position dependence of the amplitude comes from the @xmath68 non - oscillator modes contribution .",
    "the fermionic zero modes @xmath68 contribution , with our normalization , is equal to 1/2 , due to the insertion of @xmath146 .",
    "we further notice that for the bosonic modes @xmath147 along the integration line , and that as an operator @xmath148 ; therefore @xmath149 .",
    "moreover , for the transverse bosonic modes @xmath150 , whereas the remaining non - transverse part of the amplitude gives @xmath151 .",
    "finally we obtain _ 0 ^ 1 ds < ( 1)|j(s)|j(s)_0^ dl e^-lh|(2)>_rr-^(y , z ) = _ ^(1)_b^^(1)_a d ^(1 ) _",
    "^(1 ) d_2(^(1),^(2 ) ) , which reproduces precisely the expected result for the off - diagonal interaction , see sect .",
    "ii .    as a final comment",
    ", one could also suspect that the odd spin structure contribution , eq .",
    "( [ oddstr ] ) , might somehow automatically come from general world sheet supersymmetry considerations .",
    "in fact , it is known @xcite that the occurrence of the supercurrent insertion is dictated by the occurrence of the socalled supermoduli , which indeed are expected in the odd spin structure case .",
    "actually , in the cylinder case there is only one modulus , the previously introduced @xmath80 , and thus one would expect only one supermodulus and one supercurrent insertion . however in our case we are obliged to consider simoultaneously the interaction of a brane and antibrane pair with a given brane ( or antibrane ) . thus it is not surprising to see the occurrence of the pair of supercurrents @xmath152 and @xmath153 as if the brane - antibrane pair would entail the torus , rather than cylinder , topology .",
    "let us stress that in any case it is a fact that the boundary state amplitude eq .",
    "( [ oddstr ] ) reproduces exactly the correct result for the off - diagonal electric - magnetic interaction .",
    "in this section , we make more explicit the content of the formulae of sect .",
    "iii by briefly reviewing a series of results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite about the dynamics of d3-branes in @xmath2 dimensions , using the boundary state formalism . in particular we will consider the precise structure of the amplitude for the scattering of two moving of such d3-branes with an arbitrary orientation putting in evidence the various contributions coming from the four different spin structures arising in a closed string channel computation .    let us start from a 3-brane configuration with neumann boundary conditions in the directions @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and dirichlet in @xmath156 and @xmath157 , with @xmath53 .",

    "in this section we shall apply the general construction that we have introduced to the case of the type iib 3-brane wrapped on the orbifold @xmath0 . compactifying the directions @xmath194 on @xmath61",

    "@xmath0 is the orbifold limit of a @xmath197 manifold with hogde numbers @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "the standard counting of hyper and vector multplets for type iib compactifications tells us that @xmath200 and @xmath201 @xcite and the 4-dimensional low energy effective theory we are left with is therefore @xmath5 supergravity coupled to 10 hypermultiplets and 0 vector multiplets ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the only vector field arising in the compactification , namely the graviphoton , comes from the self - dual rr 4-form @xmath202 under which the d3-brane is already charged in 10 dimensions .    as explicitly shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the 3-brane wrapped on @xmath0 does not couple to the hypers ( as it must be ) and has both an electric and a magnetic charge with respect to the graviphoton , consistently with the fact that the 3-brane is selfdual in 10 dimensions .",
    "this can be seen by analyzing the velocity dependence of the large distance behavior of the scattering amplitude for two of these 3-branes moving with constant velocities in the 4-dimensional non - compact spacetime , in which they look point - like .",
    "the boundary state decribing this 3-brane wrapped on @xmath0 can be obtained from the one constructed for the non - compact 3-brane essentially through the usual quantization of the momentum along a compact direction .",
    "more precisely , recall that the @xmath0 orbifold is constructed identifying points in the covering @xmath203 which are connected by @xmath196 rotations in the 3 @xmath52 planes corresponding to each of the @xmath204 s @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath199 means that the number of complex deformations is @xmath205 in this case , consistently with the fact that the z - orbifold procedure `` freezes out '' any possible freedom in the choice of the 3 @xmath204 s @xcite .",
    "this reflects into the fact that the 3-brane configuration we consider _ must _ have one neumann and one dirichlet direction in each of the 3 @xmath204 s and is therefore wrapped on a 3-cycle which is `` democratically '' embedded in @xmath206 .",
    "let us start concentrating on a single @xmath204 factor , then .",
    "the only lattice compatible with the eventual @xmath196 moding is the triangular one , with modulus @xmath207 , as in fig .",
    "the lattice of windings @xmath208 is given by @xmath209 , with @xmath210 integers , that is @xmath211 where @xmath212 are integers of the same parity .",
    "the lattice of momenta is as usual determined by the requirement that the plane wave @xmath213 is well defined when @xmath214 is shifted by a vector belonging to the winding lattice , and one finds @xmath215 where @xmath216 are again integers of the same parity .",
    "we choose in each of the @xmath204 an arbitrary dirichlet direction @xmath217 at angle @xmath218 with the @xmath219 direction and an orthogonal neumann direction @xmath220 at angle @xmath221 with the @xmath219 direction , and fix its lenght .",
    "this amounts to choose an arbitrary vector @xmath222 in the winding lattice , which is identified by the pair @xmath223 or , more conveniently for the following , by the orthogonal pair @xmath224 , which corresponds to the orthogonal direction of allowed momenta ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in this way & & l_x = - l , l_y = l , + & & = - |n_x , = - r2 l|n_y . where @xmath225        we are now interested in the bosonic non oscillator modes contribution to the whole picture and let us start , for semplicity ,",
    "remembering the result for the non - compact case .",
    "the boundary state for the bosonic non oscillator modes in a given @xmath52 pair is [ bcont ] |y>_b = & & ( x_o - y ) |0 > + = & & e^-i ( p_x y_x + p_y y_y ) ( p_y - p_x ) |p_x , p_y > .",
    "the @xmath226-function selects momenta parallel to the dirichelet direction we have chosen .",
    "indeed if @xmath227 is the direction of the generic @xmath228 momentum , the argument of the @xmath226-function becomes proportional to @xmath229 .",
    "using of the normalization @xmath230 one recovers the following vacuum amplitude [ ampc ] < ^(1),y^(1)|e^-lh|^(2),y^(2)>_b = & & e^-i ( p_x y_x + p_y y_y ) + & & ( ^(1 ) p_y - ^(1 ) p_x ) ( ^(2 ) p_y - ^(2 ) p_x ) + = & & 1|^(1 ) - ^(2)| .    in discretizing this result we adopt the following strategy .",

    "since in this case the solution of the condition enforced by the @xmath226-functions is @xmath232 , all the momenta are zero and the exponential drops as in the continuum case .    the dirac @xmath226-function containing only integers can now be turned to a kroneker one ; however , since the latter is insensitive to an integer rescaling whereas the former transforms with an integer jacobian , we shall keep an arbitrary integer constant in this step : @xmath233 therefore , . ] with @xmath234 @xmath235 the integer @xmath236 is fixed to @xmath161 by the requirement that for @xmath237 the amplitude reduces to the `` winding '' @xmath238 . actually",
    ", in order to achieve the above limit , an infinite @xmath239 is in general required because of the discreteness of the allowed angles , even if for strictly parallel branes finite @xmath239 s are possible .",
    "indeed , @xmath240 ( which vanishes for @xmath237 ) .",
    "the final result is then [ ampd ] < ^(1),y_1|e^-lh|^(2),y_2>_b = = .",
    "the above result could have been obtained starting directly from the compact boundary state , that is , by _ first _ discretizing the continuum boundary state ( [ bcont ] ) and _ then _ computing the amplitude .",
    "the correct discrete boundary state turns out to be |y>_b = l ( ) 1(3/2 ) r^2 e^-r i ( n_x y_x + n_y / 3 y_y)(|n_x n_y - |n_y n_x ) |n_x , n_y > , and reproduces correctly eq .",
    "( [ ampd ] ) with the definition @xmath241    postponing for the moment the @xmath196 identification , let us now consider as an instructive intermediate result the case of @xmath61 .",
    "the result eq .",

    "notice that the dirac quantization condition for the off - diagonal coupling @xmath248 , which is satisfied in 10 dimensions with the minimal allowed charges @xcite , remains satisfied in 4 with an integer which depends on the branes orientation .",

    "this second consideration allows to keep track of the coupling to the various vector fields .",
    "in fact it happens that the ten vectors fields arising from dimensional reduction of the rr 4-form , couple to the brane only through four independent combinations of fields , with electric and magnetic charges parametrized by the four angles @xmath250 .",
    "since the electric and magnetic charges correponding to a given @xmath250 can not vanish simultaneously , the @xmath251-brane can not decouple from any of the four effective gauge fields , in agreement with a pure supergravity argument achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the dirac quantization condition , emerging clearly in ( [ torch ] ) , is to be understood on the sum of the couplings corresponding to the four independent @xmath250 , and not on the charges with respect to the single fields .",
    "the whole picture determines therefore a 4-parameter family of dyons which are inequivalent from the 4-dimensional point of view since they carry a different set of charges .",
    "notice finally that when two of these branes have equal @xmath250 s ( yielding vanishing @xmath252 s ) their diagonal coupling no longer depends on the angles and the off - diagonal one vanish , as appropriate for identical dyons in @xmath253 dimensions .",
    "let us discuss finally the orbifold case .",
    "as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the only effect of the @xmath196 moding is to project the boundary state for @xmath61 onto its @xmath196-invariant part .",
    "this projection can be easily performed by first computing the amplitude on @xmath61 with a relative twist @xmath254 in the orientations , @xmath255 , and then averaging finally on all the possible @xmath254 s .",
    "in the 3 @xmath52 planes satisfy @xmath256 in order to preserve at least one supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the allowed sets @xmath257 of relative twits can be taken to be @xmath258 . ]    since the bosonic zero modes contribution ( [ boszer ] ) does not depend explictly on the angles , the only modification introduced by the @xmath196 moding is in the volume : @xmath259 . for the fermions , instead , one simply sets @xmath255 ; under this relative rotation one has correspondingly : & & _ 1 _ 1 + 2 ( z_4 + z_6 + z_8 ) = _ 1 , + & & _ 2 _ 2 + 2 ( -z_4 - z_6 + z_8 ) = _ 2 + 4 z_8 , + & & _ 3 _ 3 + 2 ( z_4 - z_6 - z_8 ) = _ 3 - 4 z_4 , + & & _ 4 _ 4 + 2 ( -z_4 + z_6 - z_8 ) = _ 4 + 4 z_6 .the averaging procedure has the important consequence of projecting out the contribution depending on the non invariant @xmath260 , with respect to the @xmath61 case . indeed , [ orbch ] _ even = ^2_3",
    "_ \\{z_a } _ a ( _ a + 2 z_a ) = _ 1 , + _",
    "odd = ^2_3 _ \\{z_a } _ a ( _ a + 2 z_a ) = - _ 1 . where the @xmath261 of the averiging has canceled with the @xmath251 coming from the volume of @xmath0 . therefore , after the @xmath196 moding , only one pair of electric and magnetic charges survives , consistently with the fact that , as already pointed out at the beginning of this section , only one vector field survives to the projection in the low energy effective theory , namely the graviphoton .",
    "the fact that the dirac quantization condition still holds , like in the @xmath61 case , is due to the fact that ( [ orbch ] ) can be seen as the superposition of @xmath251 pairs of @xmath251-branes on @xmath61 , with relative angles @xmath262 instead of @xmath263 . for each pair ( [ torch ] ) holds and so for their sum , that is ( [ orbch ] ) .    summarizing ,",
    "the net effect of the wrapping of the 3-brane on @xmath0 is therefore to obtain a 1-parameter family of dyons ( rather than 4 as for @xmath61 ) whose effective couplings depend only on one combination of the relative angles between the whole 3-branes .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the @xmath196 projection , which reduces the 4 independent gauge fields to 1 , is also responsible for the decoupling of the scalars fields from the 3-brane , as seen in ref .",
    "thus , the 3-brane wrapped on @xmath0 looks like an extremal r - n configuration , being a source of gravity and maxwell field only , the mass and the dyonic charge being equal in suitable units , i.e. @xmath264 .",
