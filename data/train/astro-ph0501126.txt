    "first of all we have to derive an equivalent redshift range @xmath80 , within which we would expect to detect a single ovii whim filament with n@xmath60 @xmath25 along the line of sight to 1es  1028 + 511 .",

    "the whim imprints high - ionization metal absorption lines , both in the fuv ( mainly ovi ) and in the x - rays ( transitions from he - like and h - like c , n , o and ne , and inner shell transitions from lower ionization ions ) .",
    "while high signal - to - noise fuse fuv spectra of tens of low - redshift agns are readily available , the observed number density of relatively cool ( @xmath89 k ) shock - heated ovi filaments with n@xmath90 @xmath25 ( the average threshold sensitivity of high signal to noise fuse spectra of agns ) is low : @xmath91 ( savage et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the predicted number density of the hotter ( @xmath92 ) ovii - dominated filaments , down to the same columns ( n@xmath93 @xmath25 ) , is a factor of 5 larger , and decreases to that observed for ovi at column densities @xmath94 orders of magnitude larger ( n@xmath95 @xmath25 : fig .",
    "3 ) . the total equivalent h column density ( and so the baryon mass ) implied by pure ovii filaments ( i.e. systems in which the ovi columns are below the current sensitivity threshold ) is then more than one order of magnitude larger than that of pure ovi filaments : the bulk of the whim can only be detected in the x - ray band .",
    "= 2.5 in    detecting he - like absorption lines with n@xmath96 at @xmath97   ( about the restframe wavelength of ovii@xmath17 ) at the spectral resolution of the current x - ray spectrometers ( @xmath98 m  for both the _ chandra _ low energy transmission grating - letg - and the xmm-_newton _ reflection grating spectrometer - rgs ) , requires x - ray spectra with @xmath99 cpres in the continuum ( fig .",
    "4 , solid line ) .",
    "this requirement relaxes significantly at longer wavelength , since n@xmath100 ( for given grating resolution and cpres ) decreases with @xmath101 .",

    "4 , dashed line ) . unfortunately , however , the highest quality letg or rgs spectra of the brightest ( and very nearby ) agns contains at most 50 cpres .",
    "two important exceptions are the cases presented here : the letg spectra of the two blazars mrk  421 ( @xmath1 ) and 1es  1028 + 511 ( @xmath2 ) , observed by _",

    "this work only begins the study of the warm - hot igm outside the local group ( nicastro et al .",
    ", 2002 , 2003 ; williams et al . , 2004 ) , now that the whim has been detected and theoretical predictions have been verified .",
    "the large number of ion species showing up in the x - ray spectra imply a rich field of investigation .",
    "higher significance detections , along several other lines of sight , and at higher redshift , of he - like and h - like transitions from c , n , o and ne , will allow us to measure the relative metallicity ratios at different redshifts .",
    "this will fundamentally contribute to the assessment of the still poor measurements of metal production with cosmic age , and will help refining mechanisms for galaxy / agn - igm feedback ( e.g. galaxy superwinds , quasar winds ) .",
    "moreover , the potential for the simultaneous detection , in the same band , of inner - shell transition from lower ionization species of the same ions , will allow us to distinguish between different ionization scenarios , and to assess the importance and frequency of multiphase igm .",
    "spectral resolutions of @xmath106 in the soft x - ray band will allow us to separate different kinematics components .",
    "this has already been proven very useful in the fuv band , for example to distinguish between a local group whim origin and a halo origin for the ovi high - velocity absorbers at @xmath107 ( nicastro et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "reconstructing the distribution functions of several ions in the whim ( i.e. @xmath108 ) , will also probe very useful in distinguishing different cosmologies , and possibly tracing the distribution of dark - matter potential wells in the local universe .    observing sources with _",
    "chandra _ while in bright outburst phases has proven fruitful , allowing the detection of the whim for the first time . however ,",

    ", 2000 ) reach the level of mrk  421 during the observations presented here . while relatively short _ chandra _ and or xmm-_newton _ observations of blazars in outburst will continue to provide a cheap way to probe new sightlines for whim studies , substantial progresses in our understanding of the whim phenomenon can only be made by exploiting different observational strategies .    as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the expected number of ovii whim filaments down to a given n@xmath57 threshold , increases linearly with redshift .",
    "about 2 ovii filaments with n@xmath109 are expected up to @xmath110 along a random line of sight .",
    "such ovii columns can easily be detected with 100 ks _",
    "chandra _ and/or _",
    "newton_-xmm observations of background sources flaring at a level even 10 times lower than that reached by mrk  421 during the observations presented here .",
    "an important metric for future instrumentation to explore the whim , as shown in figure 4 , is that the sensitivity of a grating spectrum ( i.e. @xmath111 ) with constant signal to noise per resolution element , to a given column density , increases rapidly with redshift ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "smaller columns are detectable at higher redshift , as beautifully proven by the faint cv@xmath17 detection in the moderate signal - to - noise _ chandra _ spectrum of 1es  1028 + 511 ( about 60 times fainter flux than the _ chandra _",
    "mrk  421 observations presented here : fig .",
    ". these are key elements for planning future observational strategies and mission designs for whim studies .",
    "long integrations , @xmath113 ms , with _ chandra _ and/or xmm-_newton _ of high-@xmath45 sources in their quiescent states are low - risk and possibly the only way to dramatically increase the number of detections and so narrow down the large statistical errors on the @xmath3 estimate .",
    "tripling the currently detected number of whim systems , by exploiting the above observational strategy , is within the reach of current x - ray instruments , and will allow us to reduce the uncertainties on @xmath3 down to @xmath114 % , the level to which the other baryonic components in the local universe are now known ( e.g. n04a and reference therein ) .",
    "further advances in this direction will have to wait for the large collecting area of the spectrometers on the two planned x - ray missions , _",
    "constellation_-x and _ xeus _ or dedicated small missions , e.g. _ pharos _ ( elvis et al . , 2002 ) . with @xmath115100 times",
    "larger effective area and @xmath1161000 , _ constellation_-x will allow us to detect whim systems as weak as those presented in this work , for dozens of different lines of sight , and thicker filaments will be detected towards hundreds of different sightlines .",
    "this will be much more effectively done with gratings than calorimeters , particularly if the currently undergoing tests on the off - plane reflection gratings configuration for _ constellation - x _ will confirm the recently reached first - order peak absolute efficiency of 43 % ( heilmann et al . , 2004 ) . in calorimeters",
    "the resolution is constant in energy , and so the resolution element in @xmath117 degrades as @xmath118 .",
    "this dependence exactly cancels out the increase in n@xmath119 sensitivity given by the formula n@xmath120 , at @xmath111 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . moreover",
    ", the degradation of calorimeter resolution with wavelength would greatly hamper the possibility of resolving whim lines ( expected at @xmath121  ) or detecting multiphase structures in the igm ( and so prevent tests of the current paradigms for the dominant heating mechanism : internal shocks ) .",
    "this would in turn hamper our capabilities of tightly constrain the physical properties of the baryons in this diffuse web of whim .",
    "a resolving power r@xmath122 is needed to resolve thermally broadened o lines in gas at @xmath123 k and so to allow for separation of different components , and for a clear physical diagnostics ( elvis et al .",
    ", 2002 ) , which may be achievable with _ constellation_-x or _",
    "pharos_.    finally we note that it is crucial that the intrinsic noise of the detector containing the dispersed spectrum be extremely low .",
    "figure 4 shows that the lowest cpre point , from the rgs observation of 1h  0414 + 009 , is actually closer to the ideal analytical sensitivity curve , cpres vs n@xmath124 , than the one from the hrc - letg observation of 1es  1028 + 511 .",
    "the hrc - letg spectrum of 1es  1028 + 511 has almost twice as many cpre as the rgs spectrum of 1h  0414 + 009 , but a 5 times larger intrinsic instrumental noise ( @xmath125 cts s@xmath20 per resolution element ) , which greatly penalizes the detection of faint columns .",
