    "the study of single - molecule magnets ( smms ) has been the subject of experimental and theoretical interest in recent years .",
    "these systems have been pointed out@xcite to be a good candidate for investigating first- and second - order phase transition of the quantum - classical escape rate .",
    "the quantum - classical escape rate transition takes place in the presence of a potential barrier , it is mainly in two categories@xmath7 classical thermal activation over the barrier and quantum tunnelling through the barrier . at high temperatures ,",
    "transition occurs by classical thermal activation over the barrier while at low - temperatures , transition occurs by quantum tunnelling between two degenerate classical minima . in principle",
    "these transitions are greatly influenced by the anisotropy constants and the external magnetic fields .",
    "there exits a crossover temperature ( first - order transition ) @xmath8 from quantum to thermal regime , it is estimated as @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the energy barrier and @xmath11 is the instanton action responsible for quantum tunnelling .",
    "the second - order phase transition occurs for particles in a cubic or quartic parabolic potential , it takes place at the temperature @xmath12 , below @xmath12 one has the phenomenon of thermally assisted tunnelling and above @xmath12 transition occur due to thermal activation to the top of the potential barrier@xcite .",
    "garanin and chudnovsky@xcite have studied the model of a uniaxial single ferromagnetic spin with a transverse magnetic field , which is believed to describe the molecular magnet mn@xmath13ac with a total spin of @xmath14 .",
    "they showed by using the method of spin - particle mapping @xcite , that the phase transition can be understood in analogy of landau s theory of phase transition , with the free energy expressed as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 determines the quantum - classical transition and @xmath17 determines the boundary between the first- and second - order phase transition .",
    "many authors @xcite have searched for the possibility of these transitions in the biaxial single ferromagnet spin systems . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the possibility of these transitions for exchange - coupled dimer spin systems has not been reported in any literature . in many cases of physical interest , the spins in a physical system , in principle",
    "interact with each other either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically .",
    "one physical example in which these interactions occur is the molecular wheels such as mn@xmath13@xcite , and the molecular dimer [ mn@xmath4@xmath2@xcite , which comprises two mn@xmath18 smms of equal spins @xmath19 , which are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "these systems are usually modelled with two interacting giant sublattice spins .",
    "additional terms such as easy axis anisotropy , transverse anisotropy and an external magnetic field are usually added to the model hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic and low - energy properties of these systems can be studied effectively by two interacting large spin hamiltonian . due to recent experiment on molecular mn@xmath13 wheel@xcite and [ mn@xmath4@xmath2 dimer@xcite ,",
    "such effective hamiltonian has attracted so much attention . in this paper",
    "we will study one form of this effective hamiltonian .",
    "consider the effective hamiltonian of an exchange - coupled dimer of smms such as [ mn@xmath4@xmath2 in a staggered magnetic field with an easy @xmath0-axis anisotropy @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the isotropic heisenberg exchange interaction , and @xmath22 are antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) exchange coupling respectively and @xmath23 is the easy @xmath0-axis anisotropy , @xmath24 is the external magnetic field , @xmath25 is the bohr magneton and @xmath26 is the electron @xmath27-factor .",
    "the last term indicates that there are staggered magnetic fields @xmath28 and @xmath24 applied to the two sublattices a and b respectively . for the antiferromagnetic coupling ,",
    "the spins are aligned ( classically speaking ) antiparallel along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "the anisotropy and the magnetic field terms in the hamiltonian create two classical minima located at @xmath29-axis , these minima ( one being metastable ) are separated by an energy barrier , and any spin configuration can escape from one minimum to the other either by thermal activation over the barrier or by quantum tunnelling through the barrier .",
    "we have omitted a fourth order anisotropy term which is very small compare to the easy - axis term .",
    "the spin operators obey the usual commutator relation : @xmath30=i\\epsilon_{\\alpha \\beta\\gamma}\\delta_{jk}\\hat{s}_{k\\gamma}$ ] @xmath31 .",
    "the hilbert space of this system is the tensor product of the two spaces @xmath32 with dim@xmath33= @xmath34 .",
    "the basis of @xmath35 in this product space is given by @xmath36 .",
    "the eigenvalue of the diagonal term of the hamiltonian is simply given by _",
    "d = jm_am_b - d(m_a^2+m_b^2 ) + g_b h(m_a - m_b ) [ 1.1 ] note that for antiferromagnetic coupling , either @xmath37 or @xmath38 should be replaced with @xmath39 or @xmath40 , while for ferromagnetic coupling , eq . is the exact ground state energy of the quantum hamiltonian , eq . , with the eigenstates @xmath41 and @xmath42 , these two states are degenerate for @xmath43 or @xmath44 . in principle",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian eq . for antiferromagnetic spin configuration can be found by exact numerical diagonalization for some compounds @xcite .",
    "similar models of this form have been extensively studied by different methods@xcite .",
    "since the individual @xmath0-components of the spins do not commute with the hamiltonian ( only the total @xmath0-component of the spins @xmath45 commutes ) , the two antiferromagnetic classical ground states @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 etc , are not exact eigenstates of eq . , in principle there should be an energy splitting between these two states due to tunnelling .",
    "we showed@xcite via spin coherent state path integral , for @xmath43 that the degeneracy of the two states @xmath49 and @xmath50 are lifted by the transverse exchange interaction @xmath51 and the energy splitting is proportional to @xmath52 corresponding to @xmath53 order in perturbation theory in the @xmath21 term .",
    "this result had been obtained by perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "thus , the ground and the first excited states become the anti - symmetric and symmetric linear coherent superpositions of these two antiferromagnetic classical ground states@xcite .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian eq . has been used to investigate [ mn@xmath1@xmath2 dimer@xcite for which @xmath54 , thus there are @xmath55 matrices which are sparsely populated giving rise to an exact numerical digonalization of 100 non - zero energy states .",
    "the parameters use to fit experimental data for this dimer are @xmath56 , @xmath57 . at zero magnetic field",
    ", it has been demonstrated by density - functional theory that this simple model can reproduce experimental results in [ mn@xmath1@xmath2 dimer with @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this model also plays a role in quantum computation for investigating controlled - not quantum logic gates@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to map this model to a quantum mechanical particle in an effective potential and investigate the influence of the staggered magnetic field on the first- and second - order phase transition between quantum and classical regimes for the escape rate .",
    "we will show that the result of spin coherent state path integral can be recovered from this effective potential mapping .",
    "we will focus on the case of antiferromagnetic coupling since the form of hamiltonian we choose does not possess any ground state tunnelling for the ferromagnetic case .",
    "in the spin - particle formalism , one introduces the spin wave function using the @xmath60 eigenstates @xcite , and the resulting eigenvalue equation is then transformed to a differential equation , which is further reduced to a schrdinger equation with an effective potential and a constant or coordinate dependent mass . in the present problem",
    "the spin wave function can be written in a more general form as    = _ a_b = _ ^s_a , s_b _ m_a , m_b _ m_a , m_b [ 2.2 ] where _",
    "m_a , m_b = ^-1/2 ^ -1/2 it is noted that either @xmath61 or @xmath62 since we are interested in the case of antiferromagnetic spin configuration , however , as we will see later , one can check that this replacement does not alter the resulting differential equation . the action of the spin hamiltonian eq . on the spin wave function eq .",

    "the magnetic field is along the easy - axis , so we do not expect such effect in this model . in our representation the characteristic function eq . is not periodic , but by complexifying the variables @xmath68 and @xmath69 one can see that the function satisfies @xmath70 .",

    "emerge as functions of the relative coordinate .",
    "proceeding in a similar way to that of classical theory , we introduce the relative and center of mass coordinates as r = x_1-x_2,q = then eq .",

    "but in most cases of physical interest such as molecular magnets and molecular wheels @xcite , the two spins are equal .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to consider a special case of equal spins @xmath44 . in this case",
    "the expression for @xmath78 vanishes and the rest of eq . can then be simplified by separation of variable , @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80 dependence of this function is in fact unity , this can be clearly shown from eq .. the function @xmath81 can be written explicitly as ( r , q ) = _ ^s , s _ m_a ,- m_be^_1 [ dimer55 ] where @xmath82 as required for antiferromagnetic configuration .",
    "hence @xmath83 thus eq . reduces to a function of @xmath84 alone : @xmath85 it is convenient to write this equation out explicitly ( @xmath86 for convenience ) : @xmath87 one step to obtaining a schrdinger equation is to eliminate the first derivative term in eq .. this can be done by the transformation ( r ) = e^-y(r)(r ) [ 3.15 ] with @xmath88 given by    @xmath89\\ ] ]    where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .    notice that @xmath93 as @xmath94",

    "<S> we study the phase transition of the escape rate of exchange - coupled dimer of single - molecule magnets which are coupled either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically in a staggered magnetic field and an easy @xmath0-axis anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for this system has been used to study dimeric molecular nanomagnet [ mn@xmath1@xmath2 which is comprised of two single molecule magnets coupled antiferromagnetically . we generalize the method of mapping a single - molecule magnetic spin problem onto a quantum - mechanical particle to dimeric molecular nanomagnets . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is mapped to a single particle quantum - mechanical hamiltonian in terms of the relative coordinate and a coordinate dependent reduced mass . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the presence of the external staggered magnetic field creates a phase boundary separating the first- from the second - order transition . with the set of parameters used by r. tiron , @xmath3 , , 227203 ( 2003 ) , and s. hill , @xmath3 science * 302 * , 1015 ( 2003 ) to fit experimental data for [ mn@xmath4@xmath2 dimer we find that the critical temperature at the phase boundary is @xmath5 . </S>",
