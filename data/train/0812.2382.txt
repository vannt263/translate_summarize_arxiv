    "v@xmath0o@xmath1 is a classical example of a material which is located in the vicinity of a mott transition .",
    "the latter can be triggered , for example , by cr - substitution @xcite or by the application of external pressure @xcite . in this respect depositing thin films of v@xmath0o@xmath1 on a substrate with a slightly smaller in - plane lattice parameter @xmath3 is likely to provide another way of inducing a mott insulator - to - metal transition . indeed , v@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films are nowadays attracting great attention , since they promise further insight into the mechanism of the mott transition @xcite . in this context",
    ", the observation of a thickness - dependent metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in ultrathin films has been attributed to an increasing @xmath4/@xmath5 lattice parameter ratio ( decreasing @xmath5 , increasing @xmath4 ) because of interaction with the al@xmath0o@xmath1 substrate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , detailed x - ray diffraction experiments for high quality films indicate a more complex thickness - dependence of the lattice parameters @xcite . in particular , they do not point to systematic changes of the @xmath6 lattice constant for film thicknesses ranging from 100  to 1000 .    in this letter , we aim at clarifying the influence of the substrate on the electronic states of v@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films grown on al@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "indeed , for ultrathin films a significant reorganization of the electronic excitations of the film material may be induced by those of the substrate , going beyond geometric effects . in general , the properties of heterointerfaces in many cases deviate considerably from those of the component materials .",
    "a prominent example in this context is the quasi two - dimensional electron gas formed at the interface of the insulators laalo@xmath1 and srtio@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , as we will show below , the impact of an al@xmath0o@xmath1 interface on the near-@xmath7 density of states in v@xmath0o@xmath1 is rather weak as soon as the heterostructure involves several v@xmath0o@xmath1 layers .    to describe the electronic effects",
    ", we model the interface as a heterostructure consisting of alternating slabs of the component materials . comparing the v @xmath8 partial densities of states as resulting from the heterostructure calculation to the corresponding bulk data we find only a weak response of the vanadate to the bonding with the aluminate .",
    "however , the reduced dispersion of the v @xmath2 states perpendicular to the layers leads to a narrowing especially of the @xmath9 bands , which might suppress the intrinsic metalicity of @xmath10 .",
    "the unit cell used for modeling the heterostructure is the canonical threefold hexagonal supercell of the trigonal corundum lattice .",
    "it comprises six formula units as well as a stacking of six metal layers along the hexagonal @xmath4 axis .",
    "these layers are separated by layers of o atoms , which form octahedra around the metal atoms . in order to set up the heterostructure",
    ", we divide the hexagonal supercell into a v@xmath0o@xmath1 domain and an al@xmath0o@xmath1 domain , both consisting of three metal layers as well as the corresponding o layers .",
    "the @xmath4 lattice constants and the fractional coordinates of the atoms in the two slabs are those of bulk metallic v@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and al@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , respectively .",
    "in contrast , since v@xmath0o@xmath1 is grown on an al@xmath0o@xmath1 substrate , we adopt the @xmath5 lattice constant of the aluminate for the whole supercell . because the @xmath5 lattice constant of bulk v@xmath0o@xmath1 is about 3.5% larger as compared to that of bulk al@xmath0o@xmath1 , a relevant interface stress is induced , which could modify the v valence states .",
    "however , no structural relaxation has been found in the experiments @xcite . since a minor relaxation beyond the experimental resolution does not affect our further conclusions , a structure optimization consequently is dispensable .",
    "finally , using periodic boundary conditions we obtain a multilayer structure of alternating v@xmath0o@xmath1 and al@xmath0o@xmath1 slabs , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "o@xmath1/al@xmath0o@xmath1 heterostructure , as used in the calculations .",
    "the light gray and red ( b / w : dark gray ) spheres denote v and al sites , respectively .",
    "the figure shows six buckled ( horizontal ) planes of v / al atoms . for clarity",
    ", the o atoms have been omitted .",
    "they form the well - known o sublattice of corundum v@xmath0o@xmath1 and al@xmath0o@xmath1 , see the detailed description in ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the o atoms , which form a sublattice of space - filling octahedra , are omitted in this representation , since they maintain the positions of the parent compounds . for further details of the structural aspects of v@xmath0o@xmath1 and related oxides",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite as well as the references given therein .",
    "we have checked that our results do not depend on the supercell setup , i.e.  the thickness of the supercell in @xmath4 direction and the thickness of the v@xmath0o@xmath1 slab .",
    "our investigation is based on density functional theory within the local density approximation .",
    "we use a new full - potential version of the augmented spherical wave method @xcite .",
    "the basis set contains al @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath8 , o @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and v @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath8 orbitals and is complemented by states of additional augmentation spheres .",
    "brillouin zone integrations were performed using the linear tetrahedron method on a mesh of up to 264 * k*-points within the irreducible wedge of the hexagonal zone .",
    "we point out , that the well - known shortcomings of the local density approximation necessitate a careful analysis of the electronic structure in order to derive reliable conclusions as strong correlation effects are largely ignored in this approach .",
    "as has been pointed out by brinkman and rice and elaborated by others @xcite , such correlation effects may affect the metallic behavior especially if narrow bands are present near the fermi energy .",
    "thus , the following line of reasoning is closely related to previous work on the phase transitions in vanadium and titanium oxides @xcite and influenced by the results of recent lda+dmft calculations for bulk @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "turning to the results of our calculations , we compare in fig .",

    "@xcite we refer the reader to the literature . according to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , even for a v@xmath0o@xmath1 triple - layer the essential features of the v @xmath8 electronic states largely resemble those of bulk v@xmath0o@xmath1 . besides minor differences of the dos shape , the energetic positions of the main peaks are very similar .",
    "this holds for both the ( partially occupied ) @xmath17 and the ( unoccupied ) @xmath18 group of states .",
    "importantly , these findings are rather independent of small variations of the v positions , which reflects the strong localization of the v @xmath8 states @xcite . in addition",
    ", the similarity of the bulk and layer partial densities of states builds on the fact that the @xmath19-@xmath20 hybridization resulting from the covalent bonding between v @xmath8 and o @xmath14 orbitals is similar for both geometries .    in passing , we mention that the al electronic states resemble those of the bulk aluminate .",
    "this is due to the fact that al@xmath0o@xmath1 is an insulator with a large band gap of about 8.7ev .",
    "for the heterostructure the al states thus are found far below and above the fermi energy , and are hardly influenced by the v states .",
    "the most important difference between the bulk and triple - layer partial densities of states arises from the slightly reduced bandwidths of the latter , again for both the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands .",
    "a similar band narrowing has been observed for the @xmath21 bands of cr - doped bulk v@xmath0o@xmath1 , where it traces back to a reduction of the @xmath20-@xmath20 overlap coming along with the antidimerization of the v  v pairs parallel to the hexagonal @xmath4-axis . in that case",
    ", lda+dmft calculations have clearly demonstrated that the band narrowing , as induced by the structural changes , drives the metal - insulator transition as soon as the strong electronic correlations , which are only rudimentary covered by the lda , are properly included @xcite . transferring that result to the present situation",
    ", we may likewise expect insulating behavior from the reduced bandwidth of triple - layer @xmath10 .",
    "this finding should be related to the fact that the @xmath3 lattice constant used here is by 3.5% smaller than that of bulk metallic @xmath10 and , hence , would be rather in favor of metallic behavior .",
    "in addition , the @xmath6 lattice constant and the fractional coordinates of the atoms in the slab are identical to those of bulk metallic @xmath10 , which again would preferably lead to metallic behavior . as a consequence , from purely geometric considerations",
    "we would expect a broadening of the @xmath21 bands as compared to bulk metallic @xmath10 , which would be in favor of metallicity even in the presence of strong electronic correlations .",
    "yet , the opposite situation occurs . from this",
    "we conclude that the band narrowing in the triple - layer is mainly caused by the reduced @xmath20-@xmath20 overlap due to the restricted layer - geometry and only to a lesser degree by lattice parameters and atomic parameters .",
    "in fact , variation of the @xmath5 lattice constant ( within a reasonable range ) has virtually no effect on the magnitude of the band narrowing . as a consequence , taking into account the effect of strong electronic correlations we would expect insulating behavior for rather thin films and a tendency towards metallicity for thicker films .",
    "indeed , this trend has been observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , electronic structure calculations for a v@xmath0o@xmath1/al@xmath0o@xmath1 heterostructure point to rather localized v @xmath8 @xmath17 states as compared to the situation in bulk metallic @xmath10 .",
    "although the interface hardly affects the v@xmath0o@xmath1 electronic states , reduction of the @xmath17 band width due to reduced @xmath20@xmath20 overlap perpendicular to the layers may cause an insulating ground state of the system if the strong electronic correlations are taken into account .",
    "while this mechanism applies mainly to thin films with a thickness of a few v@xmath0o@xmath1 unit cells , increase of the film thickness will more likely drive an insulator - to - metal transition .",
