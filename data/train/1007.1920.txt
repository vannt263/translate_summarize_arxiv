    "a good understanding of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and baryon density is crucial for us to understand a wide range of physical phenomena .",
    "for instance , to understand the evolution of the universe in the first few seconds , one needs the knowledge of qcd phase transition at temperature @xmath3mev and very small baryon density . on the other hand ,",
    "understanding the physics of neutron stars requires the knowledge of qcd at high baryon density and very low temperature @xcite .",
    "lattice simulation of qcd at finite temperature has been successfully performed in the past few decades ; however , no successful lattice simulation at high baryon density has been done due to the sign problem @xcite : the fermion determinant is not positively definite in presence of a nonzero baryon chemical potential @xmath0 .",
    "we thus look for some special cases which have a positively definite fermion determinant .",
    "one case is qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath4 @xcite , where the ground state changes from a pion condensate to a bcs superfluid with quark - antiquark condensation with increasing isospin density .",
    "another case is the qcd - like theories @xcite where quarks are in a real or pseudoreal representation of the gauge group , including two - color qcd with quarks in the fundamental representation and qcd with quarks in the adjoint representation . while these cases do not correspond to the real world , they can be simulated on the lattice and may give us some information of real qcd at finite baryon density .",
    "for all these special cases , chiral perturbation theories predict a continuous quantum phase transition from the vacuum to the matter phase at baryon or isospin chemical potential equal to the pion mass , in contrast to real qcd where the phase transition takes place at @xmath0 approximately equal to the nucleon mass .",
    "the resulting matter near the quantum phase transition is a dilute bose condensate of diquarks or pions with weakly repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "the equations of state and elementary excitations in such matter have been investigated many years ago by bogoliubov @xcite and lee , huang , and yang @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) phenomenon is believed to widely exist in dense matter , such as pions and kaons can condense in neutron star matter if the electron chemical potential exceeds the effective mass for pions and kaons @xcite .",
    "however , the condensation of pions and kaons in neutron star matter is rather complicated due to the meson - nucleon interactions in dense nuclear medium . on the other hand , at asymptotically high density",
    ", perturbative qcd calculations show that the ground state is a weakly coupled bcs superfluid with the condensation of overlapping cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the dense bcs superfluid and the dilute bose condensate have the same symmetry breaking pattern and thus are continued with one another . in condensed matter physics , this phenomenon was first discussed by eagles @xcite and leggett @xcite and is now called bec - bcs crossover .",
    "it has been successfully realized using ultracold fermionic atoms in the past few years @xcite .",
    "while the lattice simulations of two - color qcd at finite baryon chemical potential @xcite and qcd at finite isospin chemical potential @xcite have been successfully performed , we still ask for some effective models to link the physics of bose condensate and the bcs superfluidity . the chiral perturbation theories @xcite as well as the linear sigma models @xcite , which describe only the physics of bose condensate , do not meet our purpose .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite with quarks as elementary blocks , which describes well the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking and low energy phenomenology of the qcd vacuum , is generally believed to work at low and moderate temperatures and densities @xcite .",
    "recently , this model has been used to describe the superfluid transition at finite chemical potentials @xcite for the special cases we are interested in this paper .",
    "one finds that the critical chemical potential for the superfluid transition predicted by the njl model is indeed equal to the pion mass @xcite , and the chiral and diquark condensates obtained from the mean - field calculation agree with the results from lattice simulations and chiral perturbation theories near the quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "the njl model also predicts a bec - bcs crossover when the chemical potential increases @xcite .",
    "a natural problem arises : how can the fermionic njl model describe the weakly interacting bose condensate near the quantum phase transition ?",
    "in fact , we do not know how the repulsive interactions among diquarks or mesons enter in the pure mean - field calculations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on this problem and show that the repulsive interaction is indeed properly included even in the mean - field calculations .",
    "this phenomenon is in fact analogous to the bcs description of the molecular condensation in strongly interacting fermi gases studied by leggett many years ago @xcite .",
    "fermionic models have been used to describe the bec - bcs crossover in cold fermi gases by the cold atom community .",
    "recently , it has been shown that we can recover the equation of state of the dilute bose condensate with correct boson - boson scattering length in the strong coupling limit , including the lee - huang - yang correction by considering the beyond - mean - field corrections @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ app1 ] , we give a summary of the many - body theoretical approach in cold atoms , which is useful for us to understand the theoretical approach and the results of this paper .    in this paper , using two - color two - flavor qcd as an example and following the theoretical approach of the bec - bcs crossover in cold fermi gases @xcite , we examine how the njl model describes the weakly interacting bose condensate and the bec - bcs crossover . near the quantum phase transition point @xmath1",
    ", we perform a ginzburg - landau expansion of the effective potential at the mean - field level , and show that the ginzburg - landau free energy is essentially the gross - pitaevskii free energy describing weakly interacting bose condensates via a proper redefinition of the condensate wave function . as a by - product , we obtain a diquark - diquark scattering length @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the pion decay constant ) characterizing the repulsive interaction between the diquarks , which recovers the tree - level result predicted by chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "we also show analytically that the goldstone mode takes the same dispersion as the bogoliubov excitation in weakly interacting bose condensates , which gives a diquark - diquark scattering length identical to that in the gross - pitaevskii free energy .",
    "the mixing between the sigma meson and diquarks plays an important role in recovering the bogoliubov excitation .",
    "the results of in - medium chiral and diquark condensates predicted by chiral perturbation theory are analytically recovered . at high density",
    ", we find the superfluid matter undergoes a bec - bcs crossover at @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the mass of the sigma meson . at @xmath9 , we find that the chiral symmetry is approximated restored and the spectra of pions and sigma meson become nearly degenerated .",
    "well above the chemical potential of chiral symmetry restoration , the degenerate pions and sigma",
    "meson undergo a mott transition , where they become unstable resonances . because of the spontaneous breaking of baryon number symmetry",
    ", mesons can decay into quark pairs in the superfluid medium at nonzero momentum .",
    "the beyond - mean - field corrections are studied .",
    "the thermodynamic potential including the gaussian fluctuations is derived .",
    "it is shown that the vacuum state @xmath10 is thermodynamically consistent in the gaussian approximation , i.e. , all thermodynamic quantities keep vanishing in the regime @xmath10 even though the beyond - mean - field corrections are included .",
    "near the quantum phase transition point , we expand the fluctuation contribution to the thermodynamic potential in powers of the superfluid order parameter . to leading order",
    ", the beyond - mean - field correction is quartic and its effect is to renormalize the diquark - diquark scattering length .",
    "the correction to the mean - field result is shown to be proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "thus , our theoretical approach provides a new way to calculate the diquark - diquark or meson - meson scattering lengths in the njl model beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "we also find that we can obtain a correct transition temperature of bose condensation in the dilute limit , including the beyond - mean - field corrections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec . [ s2 ] , we derive the general effective action of the two - color njl model at finite temperature and density , and determine the model parameters via the vacuum phenomenology . in sec .",
