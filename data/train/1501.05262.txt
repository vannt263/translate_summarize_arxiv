    "the task of finding an intermediate - mass black hole in a globular cluster is very challenging , because the predicted signatures of an imbh are degenerate with alternative scenarios .",
    "intermediate - mass black hole detections in globular clusters are mostly claimed on the basis of the discovery of a shallow cusp in the surface brightness profile and a rise in the velocity dispersion profile towards the centre ( e.g. , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* noyola et al . 2008 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van der marel & anderson 2010 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* noyola et al . 2010 ) ) .",
    "however , similar features can also be produced by different processes , and conclusive evidence for the existence of imbhs in globular clusters is still lacking .",
    "for example , mass segregation , core collapse , or the presence of binary stars in the centre can also generate a shallow cusp in the surface brightness profile , as shown by means of dedicated n - body simulations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vesperini & trenti 2010 ) ) .",
    "some kinematical properties can be explained by the presence of pressure anisotropy , without a central intermediate - mass black hole ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van der marel & anderson 2010 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zocchi et al . 2012 ) ) . in order to find conclusive evidence of the presence of imbh in globular clusters , it is important to fully understand the internal dynamics of these systems : in this contribution we focus on the role played by radially - biased pressure anisotropy .",
    "best - fit @xmath0 ( long - dashed line ) , michie - king ( solid line ) , and king ( short - dashed line ) models profiles are shown along with line - of - sight velocity dispersion data .",
    "empty circles represent the velocity dispersion profile calculated from velocities of single stars as in @xcite .",

    "galactic globular clusters are characterized by different relaxation conditions . for many of them , the relevant relaxation times are shorter than their age , so that they are commonly considered to be close to thermodynamical equilibrium , with an isotropic velocity distribution that is close to maxwellian . however , some large globular clusters have very long relaxation times , and their structure might be more similar to that of elliptical galaxies , for which pressure anisotropy is thought to play an important role .",
    "several studies have suggested the presence of pressure anisotropy in globular clusters ( ( * ? ? ? * ibata et al .",
    "2011 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zocchi et al . 2012 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bellazzini et al . 2015 ) ) , by analysing sets of line - of - sight kinematical data .",
    "the only data that would enable us to directly measure the presence of anisotropy in these stellar systems are proper motions ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bianchini et al . 2013 ) ) , but unfortunately these are available only for a few gcs .",
    "confirmations of the importance of this physical ingredient arrive also from numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite showed that primordial pressure anisotropy can last for long in the outer parts of globular clusters , while in the central region it is not stable , and is washed away very quickly .",
    "we recently found that anisotropy can originate in the early phases of the life of gcs , even for systems that are originally isotropic , as the result of two - body relaxation that scatters stars out of the core on radial orbits ; for clusters located in an external tidal field , it is erased in the final stages , just before their complete dissolution ( zocchi et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "even if pressure anisotropy might not concern the very central part of gcs , where we look for the presence of an imbh , we need to determine its role in shaping the _ projected _ kinematical quantities that we measure , especially when using only line - of - sight kinematical data .",
    "indeed , the presence of radially - biased anisotropy has the effect of increasing the velocity dispersion that is measured when looking towards the centre of the system , where the line - of - sight is aligned with the radial direction ; similarly , in the outermost parts , where the line - of - sight is parallel to the tangential direction , the measured velocity dispersion would be smaller ( the opposite is true for tangentially - biased anisotropic systems ) .",
    "it is therefore crucial to take anisotropy into account when looking for the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole in the centre of globular clusters .",
    "to illustrate the effect that anisotropy has on projected velocity dispersion profiles , we analyse the data available for the massive globular cluster @xmath1 cen ( ngc 5139 ) , for which several studies have been carried out , looking for the presence of an imbh at its centre ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* noyola et al . 2008 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van der marel & anderson 2010 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* noyola et al . 2010 ) ) .    in this contribution",
    "we consider three different families of dynamical models ; for simplicity , and to show more clearly the contribution of anisotropy , we chose to consider only single - mass , spherical , non - rotating models .",
    "the nontruncated radially - biased anisotropic * @xmath2 models * ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bertin & trenti 2003 ) , and references therein ) were constructed to describe the products of ( incompletely ) violently relaxed elliptical galaxies , and describe systems that are isotropic in the centre , and anisotropic in the outer parts ; the anisotropy profile has roughly the same shape for all the models in the family .",
    "truncated radially - biased anisotropic * michie - king models * ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* michie 1963 ) ) describe systems that are isotropic in the centre and near the tidal radius , and anisotropic in the intermediate radial range . depending on the value of a model parameter , namely the anisotropy radius @xmath3",
    ", it is possible to obtain different shapes for the anisotropy profile , with different values for the maximum of the anisotropy @xmath4 : when @xmath3 is very small , the maximum of @xmath4 tends to 1 , while for very large values of @xmath3 the profile becomes the same as for an isotropic model . for comparison",
    ", we also consider isotropic * king models * ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* king 1966 ) ) .",
    "we performed fits of these models to the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of @xmath1 cen .",
    "figure  [ vd ] shows the best - fit velocity dispersion profiles along with line - of - sight data ( see caption for a description ) .",
    "the effect of anisotropy is clearly visible : the central velocity dispersion is larger for the anisotropic @xmath0 models , and smaller for king isotropic models . by considering anisotropic models",
    "it is therefore possible to partially explain the innermost shape of the velocity dispersion profile , even though models that do not account for an imbh exhibit a flat profile and no cusp in the centre .",
    "anyway , it is clear that , by taking anisotropy into account , a smaller imbh mass would be needed to match a central cusp .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ sb - beta ] shows the best - fit surface brightness profiles : the models represent reasonably well the data ; only the @xmath0 model shows some significant deviations from the observed profile .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ sb - beta ] shows the anisotropy profiles of the best - fit models ; we checked that the anisotropic models are stable against radial orbit instability , by computing the value of the parameter @xmath5 ( 1.75 and 1.36 for @xmath0 and michie - king models , respectively ) introduced by @xcite .",
    "this amount of energy in radial orbits is consistent with the build - up of radial orbits that we find in our n - body models ( zocchi et al . in prep ) .",
    "pressure anisotropy plays an important role in the dynamics of globular clusters , and it should be taken into account to properly describe these systems . here",
    "we showed that models with isotropic velocity distributions in the core and radial anisotropy in the outer parts can describe reasonably well the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of @xmath1 cen , without the need of the presence of an imbh .",
    "the models we used do not take into account some of the known complexities of globular clusters : by considering rotation and by including a range of stellar masses , it will be possible to give a more accurate representation of the dynamics of this system .",
    "the uncertainty in the position of the centre of the cluster prevents an accurate determination of kinematic and photometric profiles . in the future",
    ", we plan to adopt a discrete fitting approach , and we will determine the position of the centre as a fitting parameter ."
