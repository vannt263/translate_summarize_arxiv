    "one of the central issues in condensed matter physics is to understand the interplay between diverse competing phases : for example , antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the high-@xmath7 cuprates  @xcite and charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order and superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the cdw compound tise@xmath3 has been successfully doped by a cu intercalation between adjacent layers  @xcite .",
    "this allows for tuning the electronic properties of cu@xmath8tise@xmath9 by controlling the cu concentration @xmath10 .",
    "the cu doping drives the system to a superconducting state around @xmath11 . in this regard",
    ", the cu@xmath8tise@xmath9 system provides a unique opportunity to study the competition between the cdw and superconducting phases in a controlled way .",
    "the cu@xmath8tise@xmath9 compound has a layered structure with trigonal symmetry where the @xmath12 atoms are in octahedral coordination with se .",
    "the cu atoms occupy the positions between the tise@xmath9 layers which leads to an expansion of the lattice parameters  @xcite .",
    "the parent compound tise@xmath3 is one of the first cdw compounds , where a commensurate cdw at @xmath13 k with a wave vector @xmath14 was reported  @xcite .",
    "the cdw transition is not driven by the nesting of a fermi surface .",
    "instead it is either due to a transition from a small indirect gap into a larger gap state with a slightly different location in the brillouin zone or due to a particle - hole symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the cdw transition in tise@xmath3 can be suppressed continuously by a cu doping while superconductivity emerges with a maximum @xmath15 k at @xmath16 .",
    "the electronic structure has been investigated by band structure calculations and arpes measurements  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable feature is that the cdw order parameter competes microscopically with superconductivity in the same band and that the parent compound tise@xmath9 is a correlated semiconductor and the cu doping enhances the density of states and raises the chemical potential .",
    "various measurements were also performed to further investigate the role of the cu doping  @xcite .",
    "thermal conductivity suggests that this system exhibits conventional _ s_-wave superconductivity due to the absence of a residual linear term @xmath17 at very low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "the weak magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity indicates a single gap that is uniform across the fermi surface .",
    "furthermore , it is suggested that the @xmath18 se band is below the fermi level and superconductivity is induced because of the cu doping into the @xmath19 ti bands  @xcite .",
    "an optical spectroscopy investigation on cu@xmath20tise@xmath9 reveals that the compound has a low carrier density and has an anomalous metallic state because of the substantial shift of the screened plasma frequency  @xcite .",
    "this is corroborated by the temperature - independent hall coefficient @xmath21 observed in heavily cu - doped samples  @xcite .",
    "raman scattering measurements as a function of doping suggest that the @xmath10-dependent mode softening is associated with the reduction of electron - phonon couplings and the presence of a quantum critical point within the superconducting region  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of electronic correlations in this system as a function of cu doping using @xmath0se and @xmath1cu nmr .",
    "we studied two doping levels of cu@xmath8tise@xmath9 which exhibit cdw and/or superconductivity at zero field : @xmath4 ( @xmath22 k , @xmath23 k ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 k ) . at high magnetic fields",

    "the @xmath1cu nmr spectrum consists of two peaks , which are assigned to the signals from the sample and copper coil as indicated in the figure .",
    "the symmetric , sharp spectral shape of the nmr signal indicates that the cu site is not affected by cdw modulation .",
    "the insensitivity of @xmath1cu nuclei to an electronic state should be ascribed to the fact that the cu atoms are located in between the tise@xmath9 layers which are bounded by van der waals interaction .",
    "quadrupolar effects are expected for cu nuclei which occupies a site of non - cubic symmetry but the satellites are not observable .",
    "the quadrupole frequency @xmath34 for @xmath1cu is usually on the order of 20 - 30 mhz @xcite , thus the quadrupolar satellites are probably too broad and washed out due to disorder since cu is dilute in this system . as such",

    "the @xmath1cu knight shift data exhibit very weak temperature dependence with @xmath36 % for @xmath4 and @xmath37 % for @xmath24 , whereas in comparison @xmath1cu metal has @xmath38 %  @xcite .",
    "there is no hint that its temperature dependence scales to the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "in addition , no anomalies are accompanied by the cdw transition .",
    "this might be due to the fact that the external field of 11.1 t fully suppresses the residual cdw state by shifting the chemical potential and/or changing the electronic density of states of ti 3__d _ _ bands .",
    "the @xmath1cu spin - lattice relaxation rate for @xmath24 varies linearly with temperature , obeying korringa behavior with a slope approximately 1/18 times that of a pure @xmath1cu metal .    since the se atoms are located on the layers , they probe the fermi surface and provide more information on electronic correlations in this material .",

    "the nmr shift is constant from 280 k to 150 k but increases monotonically upon further cooling .",
    "we note that the room temperature nmr shift @xmath40 for the cu@xmath2tise@xmath3 samples ( @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) are close to the reported nmr shift values of the selenide compounds tise@xmath3 ( @xmath45 )  @xcite and tase@xmath3 ( @xmath46 )  @xcite .    in figure  [ fig:3 ]",
    "we compare temperature dependence of @xmath5 of cu@xmath2tise@xmath3 ( @xmath47 ) single crystals with that of a @xmath0se metal  @xcite and powdered tise@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "a single - exponential fitting equation @xmath48 $ ] was used to extract the @xmath49 values from the magnetization recovery curves .",
    "it is apparent that an increase of the cu doping concentration leads to an enhancement of the relaxation rate as well as an increase of the slope of the korringa - like behavior .",

    "[ fig:3 ] shows the non - linear @xmath5 vs t behavior of the parent compound tise@xmath9 and the subsequent linear behavior upon cu doping which suppresses the cdw state . in order to understand the underlying mechanism of the observed @xmath5 behaviors we invoke a model involving a korringa factor @xmath50 due to the effect of electron - electron interaction in metals and alloy compounds developed by moriya  @xcite and later refined by narath and weaver  @xcite .    in simple metals ,",
    "the dominant relaxation mechanism of nuclear spins is due to their interaction with conduction electron spins .",

    "the value of @xmath50 ranges from 0 to 1 . for @xmath71 , @xmath72 which gives us eqn.([eq : korr1 ] ) .",
    "a corrected version was later formulated by narath appropriate for alkali and noble metals where the function potential has a non - zero interaction range less than the atomic radius  @xcite .    before delving into the korringa factor calculation , we note that the orbital shift contribution can not , in the present case , be accurately separated from the spin part . typically , the orbital contribution can be unambiguously determined in the superconducting state where the spin part of the shift vanishes at low temperature due to pairing .",
    "however , access of nmr in the superconducting state , believed to be of bcs type  @xcite , is hampered by the low upper critical field ( @xmath73 t )  @xcite of these compounds .",
    "we can however make some estimates based on the nmr data from the parent compound tise@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the total nmr shift @xmath40 can be expressed as :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the _",

    "p_-electron core polarization term , @xmath77 is the van vleck orbital contribution , and @xmath78 is the chemical shift .",
    "experimental estimates from a previous @xmath0se nmr study on tise@xmath3 @xcite at room temperature yield @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 thus the temperature - independent part @xmath82 is 0.071% .",
    "since cu doping into the tise@xmath3 layers increases the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , this will increase @xmath75 and @xmath76 , but the terms @xmath77 and @xmath78 should be unaffected since they do not depend on dos .",
    "we can then estimate the spin - part of the total shift for cu@xmath2tise@xmath3 system to be approximately ( @xmath83 ) .",
