    "in this work , we investigate the role of friends and enemies on the evolution of social networks . we represent individuals as nodes in a graph and a relationship between individuals as a link that joins the corresponding nodes . to quantify a relationship",
    ", we assign the binary variable @xmath1 to link @xmath2 , with @xmath3 if nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 are friends , and @xmath6 if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are enemies ( fig .  [ process ] ) .",
    "a basic characterization of relationships between mutual acquaintances is the notion of _ social balance _ @xcite .",
    "the triad @xmath7 is defined as balanced if the sign of the product of the links in the triad @xmath8 equals 1 , while the triad is imbalanced otherwise .",
    "we define a triad to be of type @xmath9 if it contains @xmath10 negative links .",
    "thus @xmath11 and @xmath12 are balanced , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are imbalanced .",
    "a balanced triad therefore fulfills the adage    * a friend of my friend is my friend ; * an enemy of my friend is my enemy ; * a friend of my enemy is my enemy ; * an enemy of my enemy is my friend ,    while an imbalanced triad is analogous to a frustrated plaquette in a random magnet @xcite .",
    "a network is balanced if each constituent triad is balanced @xcite .",
    "an ostensibly more general definition of a balanced network is that _ every _ cycle in the network is balanced .",
    "cartwright and harary showed @xcite that the cycle - based and triad - based definitions of balance are equivalent on complete graphs .",
    "their result implies that if an imbalanced cycle of any length exists in a complete graph , an imbalanced triad also exists .",
    "balance theory has been initiated by heider @xcite and other social psychologists @xcite , and the subject remains an active research area @xcite .",
    "much of this work was devoted to classifying balanced stable states of networks when relationships are static .",
    "a fundamental result from these studies is that balanced societies are remarkably simple : either all individuals are mutual friends ( we call such a state `` paradise '' ) , or the network segregates into two antagonistic cliques where individuals within the same clique are mutual friends and individuals from distinct cliques are enemies ( we call such a state `` bipolar '' ) @xcite .",
    "balance theory also has natural applications to international relations @xcite . as a particularly compelling example , the triple alliance ( 1882 ) pitted germany , austria - hungary , and italy against the triple entente ( 1907 ) countries of britain , france , and russia @xcite .",
    "this bipolar state of competing alliances clearly contributed to the onset of world war i.    a large network is almost surely imbalanced if the relationships are randomly chosen to be friendly or unfriendly .",
    "clearly such a network is socially unstable and the web of relations must evolve to a more stable state if the individual nodes behave rationally . in this work ,",
    "we go beyond a static description social relations and investigate how an initially imbalanced society achieves balance by endowing a network with a prototypical social dynamics that reflects the natural human tendency to reduce imbalanced triads",
    ". a related line of investigation , based on evolving social networks with continuous interaction strengths , has also recently appeared @xcite .",
    "we first consider what we term _ local triad dynamics _ ( ltd ) . in an update step of ltd , we first choose a triad at random . if this triad is balanced ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) , no evolution occurs . if the triad is imbalanced ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) , we change @xmath15 on one of the links as follows : @xmath16 occurs with probability @xmath0 , and @xmath17 occurs with probability @xmath18 , while @xmath19 occurs with probability 1 ( fig .",
    "[ process ] ) .",
    "one unit of time is defined as @xmath20 update events , where @xmath20 is the total number of links .",
    "notice that for the special case of @xmath21 , each link of an imbalanced triad is flipped equiprobably . when @xmath22 , the density of friendly links consequently tends to increase and the society is predisposed to tranquility , while for @xmath23 the societal predisposition is hostility .    after an update step in ltd ,",
    "the imbalanced target triad becomes balanced , but other balanced triads that share a link with this target may become imbalanced",
    ". these triads can subsequently evolve and return to balance , leading to new imbalanced triads .",
    "such an interaction cascade is familiar in social settings .",
    "for example , if a married couple breaks up , the acquaintances of the couple may then be obliged to redefine their relations with each partner in the couple so as to maintain balanced triads .",
    "these redefinitions , may lead to additional relationship shifts , _",
    "etc_.     ( left ) and @xmath14 ( right ) and the possible outcomes after an update step by local triad dynamics .",
    "full and dashed lines represent friendly ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath3 ) and unfriendly ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath24 ) relations respectively . ]    for @xmath25 , we shall show that ltd quickly drives an infinite network to a quasi - stationary dynamic state where global characteristics , such as the densities of friendly relations or imbalanced triads , fluctuate around stationary values . as @xmath0 passes through a critical value of @xmath26 , the network undergoes a phase transition to a paradise state where no unfriendly relations remain .",
    "on the other hand , a finite network always reaches a balanced state . for @xmath25 ,",
    "this balanced state is bipolar and the time to reach this state scales faster than exponentially with network size . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the final state is paradise .",
    "the time to reach this state scales algebraically with @xmath28 when @xmath29 , and logarithmically in @xmath28 for @xmath30 .",
    "we also investigate _ constrained triad dynamics _ ( ctd ) . here , we select a random link , and change @xmath15 for this link if the total number of imbalanced triads decreases .",
    "if the total number of imbalanced triads is conserved in an update , then the update occurs with probability 1/2 .",
    "updates that would increase the total number of imbalanced triads are not allowed .",
    "we again define the unit of time as @xmath20 update events , so that on average each link is changed once in unit of time .",
    "the global constraint accounts for the socially - plausible feature that an agent considers all of its mutual acquaintances before deciding to change the character of a relationship .",
    "ctd also corresponds to an ising model with a three - spin interaction between the links of a triad , @xmath31 , where the sum is over all triads @xmath7 , with zero - temperature glauber dynamics @xcite . as we shall see ,",
    "a crucial outcome of ctd is that a network is quickly driven to a balanced state in a time that scales as @xmath32 .    in the following two sections we analyze the dynamics of networks that evolve by ltd or ctd . for simplicity",
    ", we consider networks with a complete graph topology  everyone knows everyone else .",
    "this limit is appropriate for small networks , such as the diplomatic relations of countries .",
    "we then summarize and discuss some practical implications of our results in sec .  iv .",
    "we begin with essential preliminaries for writing the governing equations for the various triad densities .",
    "let @xmath28 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 be the numbers of nodes , links , and triads in the network .",
    "define @xmath35 as the number of triads that contain @xmath10 negative links , with @xmath36 the respective triad densities , and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) the number of positive ( negative ) links .",
    "the number of triads and links are related by @xmath39 the numerator counts the number of positive links in all triads while the denominator appears because each link is counted @xmath40 times .",
    "the density of positive links is therefore @xmath41 , while the density of negative links is @xmath42 .",
    "a fundamental network characteristic is @xmath43 , which is defined as follows : for each positive link , count the number of triads of type @xmath9 that are attached to this link .",
    "then @xmath43 is the average number of such triads over all positive links .",
    "this number is @xmath44 the factor @xmath45 accounts for the fact that each of the @xmath35 triads of type @xmath9 is attached to @xmath46 positive links ; dividing by @xmath37 then gives the average number of such triads .",
    "analogously , we introduce @xmath47 .",
    "since the total number of triads attached to any given link equals @xmath40 , the corresponding triad densities are    @xmath48    we now write the rate equations that account for changes in the various triad densities in a single update event .",
    "we choose a triad at random ; if it is imbalanced ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) we change one of its links as shown in fig .",
    "[ process ] .",

[ process ] ) @xmath55    since each update changes @xmath40 triads , and we also defined one time step as @xmath20 update events , the rate equations for the triad densities have the size - independent form @xmath56      we first study stationary states . setting the left - hand sides of eqs .",

    "and the density of friendly relations @xmath65 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "simulation results for @xmath65 for @xmath71 ( crosses ) and 256 ( boxes ) are also shown . ]      a remarkable feature of equations ( [ ni - rate ] ) is that if the initial triad densities are given by eq .",
    "( [ stat - nj])uncorrelated densities  the densities will remain uncorrelated forever . for such initial conditions",
    "it therefore suffices to study the time evolution of the density of friendly links @xmath72 .",
    "this time evolution can be extracted from eqs .",
    "( [ ni - rate ] ) , or it can be established directly by noting that @xmath72 increases if @xmath19 or @xmath73 , and decreases if @xmath17 . taking into account that the respective probabilities for these processes are @xmath74 , and @xmath18 , we find @xmath75 thus the time dependence of the density of friendly links is given by the implicit relation @xmath76    when @xmath25 , the stationary density of eq .",

    "such absorbing states are necessarily balanced , because any network that contains an imbalanced triad continues to change . to see why such an absorbing state must eventually be reached , consider the evolution in which _ at each step",
    "_ an unfriendly link changes to friendly in an imbalanced triad .",
    "since the number of unfriendly links always decreases , a balanced state is reached in a finite number steps . finally ,",
    "because this particular route to a balanced state has a nonzero probability to occur , any initial network ultimately reaches an absorbing balanced state .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    our simulations show that a finite network evolves to a bipolar state for @xmath25 , independent of the initial state .",
    "the size difference of the two final cliques is virtually independent of the initial configuration because the network spends an enormous time in a quasi - stationary state before reaching the absorbing state . for @xmath25",
    ", we estimate the time to reach a bipolar state by the following crude argument @xcite .",
    "consider a nearly balanced network .",
    "when a link is flipped on an imbalanced triad , then of the order of @xmath28 new imbalanced triads will be created in the adjacent triads that contain the flipped link . thus starting near a balanced state , local triad dynamics",
    "is equivalent to a biased random walk in the state space of all network configurations , in which the bias is directed away from the balanced state , with the bias velocity @xmath86 proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "conversely , when the network is far from balance , local triad dynamics is diffusive in character because the number of imbalanced triads will change by of the order of @xmath87 equiprobably in a single update .",
    "the corresponding diffusion coefficient @xmath88 is then proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "since the total number of triads in a network of @xmath28 nodes is @xmath90 , we therefore expect that the time @xmath91 to reach balance will scale as @xmath92    when @xmath27 , paradise is reached with a probability that quickly approaches one as @xmath93 . at the threshold @xmath29 , a naive estimate for the time @xmath91 to reach paradise",

    "[ fluctsig ] , we estimate this width by analyzing the fluctuations below the threshold @xmath25 and obtain essentially this same result .    summarizing , the asymptotics for the absorption time are : @xmath117 in agreement with the simulation results in fig .",
    "[ avtime ] .",
    "in constrained triad dynamics ( ctd ) , the number of imbalanced triads can not increase in an update event , and the final state can either be balanced or jammed .",
    "a jammed state is one in which imbalanced triads exist and for which the flip of any link increases the number of imbalanced triads .",
    "since this type of update is forbidden in ctd , there is no escape from a jammed state .",
    "moreover , jammed states turn out to be much more numerous than balanced states ( see sec .  [ enumer ] ) . in spite of this fact , we find that the probability for the network to reach a jammed state , @xmath118 , quickly goes to zero as @xmath28 increases , except for the case of an initially antagonistic society ( @xmath84 ) , where @xmath118 decays slowly with @xmath28 ( fig .",

    "it is worth mentioning that we never observed `` blinkers '' @xcite in simulations , although we can not prove that such states do not exist .",
    "these are trajectories in the state space that evolve forever and correspond to a network in which all possible updates involve no change in the number of imbalanced triads .     as a function of @xmath28 for several values of @xmath119 . ]",
    "another fundamental feature of ctd is that the time @xmath91 for a network of @xmath28 nodes to reach its final state generically scales as @xmath32 .",
    "while @xmath91 now depends on the initial condition , in contrast to ltd , this dependence occurs either in the amplitude or in lower - order corrections of the absorption time .",
    "thus the logarithmic growth of @xmath91 with @xmath28 is a robust feature of ctd .",
    "an unexpected feature of ctd is the phase transition for the difference in sizes @xmath120 and @xmath121 of the two final cliques as a function of @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "[ bavdi ] ) .",
    "we quantify this asymmetry by the scaled size difference @xmath122 .",
    "for @xmath123 the cliques sizes in the final bipolar state are nearly the same size and @xmath124 .",
    "as @xmath119 increases toward @xmath125 , the size difference of the two cliques continuously increases .",
    "a sudden change occurs at @xmath126 , beyond which the final network state is paradise .",
    "the probability distribution for @xmath127 is sharply peaked about its average value as @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ bpd ] ) .",
    "since @xmath128 and the density of friendly links @xmath65 are related by @xmath129 in a large balanced society , uncorrelated initial relations generically lead to @xmath130 .",
    "thus ctd tends to drive a network into a friendlier final state .     for several network sizes . ]     and",
    "@xmath26 . ]",
    "while we do not have a detailed understanding of this phase transition , we give a qualitative argument that suggests that a large network undergoes a sudden change from @xmath131 ( two equal size cliques ) when @xmath132 to @xmath133 ( paradise ) when @xmath134 .",
    "the fact that the transition appears to be located near @xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ bavdi ] ) rather than at @xmath136 indicates that our approach is not a complete description for the transition .",
    "we first assume , as observed in simulations of large networks , that jammed states do not arise .",
    "we also assume that a network remains uncorrelated during its early stages of evolution .",
    "consequently the densities @xmath137 of triads that are attached to a positive link are @xmath138 for a link to change from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , it is necessary that @xmath139 . from eq .",

    "( [ rho - ctd - sol ] ) a network should evolve to paradise for any initial condition .",

    ", the density of friendly links @xmath151 initially still increases according to ( [ rho - ctd - sol ] ) until @xmath152 . at this point ,",
    "correlations in the relationship structure begin to arise and these ultimately lead to a bipolar society with @xmath153 .",
    "we now give a qualitative argument to support these observations .",
    "when @xmath154 , there are many partitions of the network into two subnetworks @xmath155 and @xmath156 of nearly equal sizes @xmath157 and @xmath158 , for which the density of friendly links within each subnetwork , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , slightly exceed @xmath26 , while the density @xmath161 of friendly links between subnetworks is slightly less than @xmath26 .",
    "our basic point is that this small fluctuation is amplified by ctd so that the final state is two nearly equal - size cliques .    to appreciate how such an evolution can occur",

    "these link densities thus evolve according to the rate equations @xmath171 and give the instability needed to drive the network to a final bipolar state .",
    "the last step in our argument is to note that when @xmath172 , the number of ways , @xmath173 , to partition the original network into the two nascent subnetworks @xmath155 and @xmath156 , is maximal .",

    "stability ensures that there are at most @xmath225 imbalanced triads attached to the link @xmath226 .",
    "recalling that @xmath200 is imbalanced and that there are @xmath220 imbalanced triads @xmath221 , we obtain @xmath227 . a similar argument applied to link @xmath228 leads to @xmath229 .",
    "summing these inequalities and using @xmath224 gives @xmath230 , or @xmath231 for even @xmath28 .",
    "the case of odd @xmath28 is similar .",
    "we set @xmath232 , with @xmath233 .",
    "now each link is attached to at least @xmath10 balanced triads and at most @xmath234 imbalanced triads .",
    "repeating the same argument as for the even case we obtain the conditions @xmath235 and @xmath236 with @xmath224 , which leads to @xmath237 for odd @xmath28 .",
    "last , we show that the number of jammed configurations greatly exceeds the number of balanced configurations .",
    "the total number of distinct network configurations is @xmath238 .",
    "each balanced state has the form @xmath239 , and we enumerate all classes of balanced states by counting the integer solutions of @xmath240 , with @xmath241 .",
    "therefore the number of classes of balanced states is @xmath242 for @xmath212 and @xmath243 .",
    "the total number @xmath244 of balanced states is determined from @xmath245 and is thus much larger than the number of classes of balanced states .",
    "for the number of classes of jammed states @xmath246 and the number of jammed states @xmath247 , we can only establish lower bounds .",
    "for large @xmath28 , instead of exact counting we employ a continuum description . from eq .",
    "( [ m123 ] ) , the number of jammed partitions is equal to @xmath89 times the area @xmath248 of the region inside the triangle @xmath249 defined by inequalities @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 ; this area is @xmath253 .",
    "we also divide by @xmath254 to account for over - counting different permutations of @xmath255 .",
    "thus @xmath256 .",
    "we could improve this bound by counting additional jammed states built from the construction in fig .",
    "[ strange9z](c ) , but this contribution would not affect the @xmath28 dependence of the bound . however , we do not know whether @xmath257 or @xmath246 grows faster than @xmath89 due to the existence of jammed states , such as those in fig .",
    "[ strange9z](a ) , that are not in the classes described in sec .",
    "[ construct ] .",
    "we obtain a lower bound for @xmath247 in a similar manner to that in eq .",
    "( [ balanced ] ) for counting the number of balanced states , @xmath258 where the sum is over jammed partitions , and the trinomial coefficient is @xmath259 the summand in eq .",
    "( [ jammed ] ) is sharply peaked around @xmath260 and therefore the sum is very close to @xmath261 which is the sum over _ all _ partitions .",
    "again , the lower bound may be weak because of the neglect of non - tripartite jammed configurations .    in summary , we find that @xmath262 .",
    "thus the total number of jammed states greatly exceeds the total number of balanced states .",
    "nevertheless , for a random initial condition , the probability to end in a balanced state is very close to one while the probability to end in a jammed state is negligible ; that is , the basin of attraction of balanced states greatly exceeds the basin of attraction of jammed states .",
    "in social relations , we may encounter the uncomfortable situation of an imbalanced triad .",
    "if you have two friends that develop a mutual animosity , then an imbalanced triad of relations exists .",
    "you will then likely have to choose between these two friends , thereby resolving the social conflict and restoring the relationship triads to balance . in this work",
    ", we implemented simple and prototypical dynamical rules for healing imbalanced triads and we investigated the resulting evolution of these social networks .    in the case of local triad dynamics",
    ", a finite network falls into a socially - balanced state , where no frustrated triads remain .",
    "the time to reach this final state depends very sensitively on the propensity @xmath0 for forming friendly links in the update events that heal social imbalance . for an infinite network ,",
    "the balanced state is never reached when @xmath25 and the system remains in a stationary state .",
    "the density of unfriendly links gradually decreases and the network undergoes a dynamical phase transition to an absorbing , paradise state for @xmath27 .",
    "we also examined the dynamics in which an additional global constraint is imposed that the number of imbalanced triads in the entire network can not increase in an update event .",
    "the virtue of this dynamics is that the final outcome is always reached quickly .",
    "a downside , however , is that the final configuration of the network may be jammed  these are states that are not balanced , but where flipping any link increases the number of imbalanced triads .",
    "fortunately , the probability of reaching a jammed state is vanishingly small and the final state is either a two - clique bipolar state or paradise .",
    "as alluded to in the introduction , a natural application for social balance ideas is to international relations , with the prelude to world war i being a particularly appropriate example .",
    "for example , the three emperors league ( 1872 , and revived in 1881 ) aligned germany , austria - hungary , russia , leaving france isolated . however , the turkish - russian war ( 1877 ) and tension between austria - hungary and the balkan states unraveled russia s participation in the league , and a bipartite agreement between germany and russia lapsed in 1890 . in the meantime ,",
    "the triple alliance was formed in 1882 that joined germany , austria - hungary , and italy into a bloc that continued until world war i.    on the other hand , a french - russian alliance was formed over the period 1891 - 94 that ended france s diplomatic isolation with respect to the triple alliance .",
    "subsequently an entente cordiale between france and great britain was consummated in 1904 , and then a british - russian agreement in 1907 , after long - standing tensions between these two countries , that then bound france , great britain , and russia into the triple entente . while our historical account of these byzantine maneuvers is very incomplete ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more information ) , the basic point is that among the six countries that comprised the two major alliances , bipartite relationships changed as triads became unbalanced and there was a reorganization into a balanced state of the triple alliance and the triple entente that became the two main protagonists at the start of world war i.    on the theoretical side , there are several avenues for additional research .",
    "one possibility is to relax the definition of imbalanced somewhat .",
    "this is the direction followed by davis @xcite who proposed the `` clusters model '' in which triads with three unfriendly relations are deemed acceptable .",
    "the clusters model thus allows for the possibility that `` an enemy of my enemy may still be my enemy . ''",
    "this more relaxed definition for imbalanced triads may lead to interesting dynamical behavior that will be worthwhile to explore .",
    "another natural generalization of the balance model would be to ternary relationships of positive @xmath50 , negative @xmath51 , or indifferent @xmath263 .",
    "these relations may lead to the emergence of cliques ( groups of mutual friends who dislike other people ) and communities ( groups of mutual friends with no relations with other people )",
    ". it would be interesting to study the number of cliques and number of communities as a function of network size and the density of indifferent relationships .",
    "communities on the web can be effectively identified @xcite , and these results may allow for useful comparisons between data and model predictions . finally , relations need not be symmetric , that is , @xmath264 may be different from @xmath265 , and it may be interesting to generalize the basic notions of balance to networks with such asymmetric interactions .",
    "in this appendix , we compute the normalized variance @xmath266 . we focus on the most interesting case of the critical regime @xmath29 , where fluctuations exhibit the asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "then we briefly discuss the two regimes @xmath25 and @xmath30 .",
    "we first note that @xmath109 changes according to @xmath267 which describe the processes @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and @xmath270 , respectively . from ( [ a - rule ] ) we obtain @xmath271 which simplifies to @xmath272 at the threshold @xmath29 . since @xmath273 and @xmath274 to lowest order , eq .",
    "( [ a - eq ] ) can be written as @xmath275 whose solution is given by eq .",
    "( [ rho - sol - crit ] ) . similarly from ( [ a - rule ] ) we obtain @xmath276 which , for @xmath29 , simplifies to @xmath277 subtracting eq .",
    "( [ a - eq ] ) multiplied by @xmath278 from eq .",
    "( [ a2-eq ] ) , we obtain the evolution equation for the variance @xmath279 now using standard methods @xcite to compute moments of the stochastic variable @xmath280 ( [ expansion ] ) , we obtain the leading behavior @xmath281 , while @xmath282 , and @xmath283 . similarly , the leading terms in @xmath284 and @xmath285 cancel , while the next correction is @xmath286 using these results for the various moments , the variance satisfies @xmath287 dividing ( [ s - eq ] ) by ( [ a - eq ] ) we obtain @xmath288 since @xmath289 solves the homogeneous equation @xmath290 , we seek a solution of the inhomogeneous equation ( [ sa - eq ] ) in the form @xmath291 .",
    "equation ( [ sa - eq ] ) becomes @xmath292 whose solution is @xmath293 thus @xmath291 , with @xmath294 given by ( [ s - sol ] ) .",
    "the integration constant @xmath295 is fixed to satisfy the initial condition @xmath296 .",
    "in particular , for a totally antagonistic initial network ( @xmath84 or @xmath297 ) , @xmath298 . in this case @xmath299 , and the variance becomes @xmath300    the leading asymptotic behavior @xmath301 holds independent of the initial condition .",
    "hence we establish the crucial result ( [ sigma ] ) , which leads to the asymptotic behavior ( [ correct ] ) for the absorption time for @xmath29 .    for @xmath302 , or @xmath303",
    ", we recast eq .",
    "( [ ap - eq ] ) to @xmath304 which is of course identical to eq .",
