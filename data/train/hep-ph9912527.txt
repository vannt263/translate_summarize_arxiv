    "the discovery of the standard higgs boson is one of the major goals of the present and future searches in particle physics .",
    "direct or indirect results give stringent lower and upper bounds on its mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , the problematic scalar sector of the standard model ( sm ) can be enlarged and some simple extensions such as the minimal two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) versions @xcite are intensively studied .",
    "the two most popular versions of the thdm ( type i and ii ) , differ in some higgs couplings to fermions , but in both types and after electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , the higgs spectrum is the same . from the 8 degrees of freedom",
    "initially present in the 2 higgs doublets , 3 correspond to masses of the longitudinal gauge bosons and we are left with 5 degrees of freedom which manifest themselves as 5 physical higgs particles ( 2 charged higgs @xmath5 , 2 cp - even @xmath6 , @xmath7 and one cp  odd @xmath8 ) .",
    "the charged higgs @xmath5 , because of its electrical charge , is noticeably different from the other sm or thdm higgs particles . in other words",
    "the discovery of a charged scalar higgs boson would attest definitively that the standard model is overcome . on the contrary",
    "a neutral higgs experimental evidence has to be refined to go beyond the sm@xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can construct models with an even larger scalar sector than in the thdm , one of the most popular being the higgs triplet model ( htm ) @xcite . a noteworthy difference between thdm and htm",
    "is that the htm contains a tree level @xmath9 coupling while in the thdm this coupling is only generated at one loop level @xcite . in models of the htm type ,",
    "the physical predictions are sometimes very different from typical ones in the sm and or the thdm . in our study , we will only consider models with two higgs doublets .    the study of thdm is also very interesting insofar as it provides a general framework to test the minimal suspersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite",
    ". of course the particle spectrum of the mssm doubles that of the thdm , but the scalar higgs sectors , responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , are analogous , up to some mass constraints and couplings in the mssm . in any case , the study of the various production mechanisms of charged higgs bosons would give information about new physics beyond the sm .",
    "in future colliders or linear accelerators devoted to the electron - positron annihilations , the simplest way to get a charged higgs is through @xmath5 pair production .",
    "such studies have been already undertaken at tree - level @xcite and one - loop orders @xcite and shown that @xmath10 machines will offer a clean environment and in that sense a higher mass reach , especially if the 12 tev options are available .",
    "we mention also that charged higgs bosons pair production through laser back ",
    "scattered @xmath11 collisions has been studied in the literature @xcite and found to be prominent to discover the charged higgs boson .",
    "note also that charged higgs bosons can be produced in hadronic machines :    ( @xmath12 ) single charged higgs production via @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite    ( @xmath16 ) single charged higgs production in association with @xmath0 gauge boson via @xmath17 or @xmath18 @xcite    ( @xmath19 ) @xmath5 pair production through @xmath20 annihilation would be feasible only if the charged higgs decay in top - bottom is kinematically forbidden @xcite , otherwise one would have to look at bosonic decay modes ( ex .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc ... ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is the study of the production of the charged higgs boson in association with a @xmath0 gauge boson through electron positron annihilation .",
    "this process is kinematically better suited than the @xmath5 pair production when the higgs mass is larger than the w mass .",
    "although it is a rare process in the thdm , loop or / and threshold effects can give a substantial enhancement .",
    "moreover , once worked out , any experimental deviation from the results within such a model should bring some fruitful information on the new physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
