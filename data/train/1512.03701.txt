    "<S> nonlocality is a key feature discriminating quantum and classical physics . </S>",
    "<S> quantum - interference phenomena , such as young s double slit experiment , are one of the clearest manifestations of nonlocality , recently addressed as _ dynamical _ to specify its origin in the quantum equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that loss of dynamical nonlocality can occur due to ( partial ) collapse of the wavefunction due to a measurement , such as which - path detection . </S>",
    "<S> however , alternative mechanisms affecting dynamical nonlocality have hardly been considered , although of crucial importance in many schemes for quantum information processing . here , we present a fundamentally different pathway of losing dynamical nonlocality , demonstrating that the detailed geometry of the detection scheme is crucial to preserve nonlocality . by means of a solid - state quantum - interference experiment </S>",
    "<S> we quantify this effect in a diffusive system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that interference is not only affected by decoherence , but also by a loss of dynamical nonlocality based on a local reduction of the number of quantum conduction channels of the interferometer . with our measurements and theoretical model </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this mechanism is an intrinsic property of quantum dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the geometrical constraints protecting nonlocality is crucial when designing quantum networks for quantum information processing .        besides the famous bell nonlocality  @xcite , allowing for correlations between distant particles stronger than classically possible , the importance of another fundamental quantum nonlocality </S>",
    "<S> , although discovered over five decades ago , has been pointed out recently , and has been referred to as `` dynamical nonlocality ''  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamical nonlocality follows from the nonlocality of the quantum equations of motion , clearly manifests itself in branching geometries , and is at the base of all quantum - interference phenomena , such as young s double slit experiments , mach@xmath0zehnder interferometers  @xcite , and the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> loss of dynamical nonlocality implies quenching of interference . if a quantum mechanical wavefunction , e.g. describing a propagating electron , is spatially split to enclose a region of magnetic flux , a phase difference develops , leading to quantum - interference oscillations periodic in the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is planck s constant and @xmath3 is the electronic charge ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical nonlocality of the wavefunction induced by a branching geometry is , together with quantum coherence , the basic ingredient of any quantum - interference phenomenon .    in this report </S>",
    "<S> , we present a set of electron - interference experiments in which , besides the effect of decoherence , i.e. the randomization of the single - electron phase due to inelastic scattering , we also observe and quantify the effect of loss of dynamical nonlocality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> loss of dynamical nonlocality has been first demonstrated and tuned in which - path experiments  @xcite , one of the most remarkable manifestations of the complementarity principle . in these experiments , </S>",
    "<S> detection of the photon , respectively electron , traversing the two branches of the interferometer induces a collapse of the delocalized quantum state ( wave - like ) in a localized one ( particle - like ) , resulting in quenching of the interference . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate a new phenomenon affecting the dynamical nonlocality of the electron that , different from the which - path scheme , is inherent to the device geometry and originates from a reduction of the number of conduction channels instead of from the interaction with the external environment described above . </S>",
    "<S> this loss of dynamical nonlocality is not observed in a regular , local ( l ) ab measurement geometry ( see fig .  [ goldenring]a(red ) ) , but does play a significant role in the nonlocal ( nl ) geometry of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> goldenring]a(blue ) . in the nonlocal geometry , also </S>",
    "<S> the quantum nature of the _ side arms _ of the ring is crucial , as opposed to the local geometry , where only the ring itself matters . in the side arms , conduction channels linked to the two different branches of the ring </S>",
    "<S> can directly interact and merge , which is prevented in the ring itself . </S>",
    "<S> the implication of this fundamental difference will be discussed in detail below .        </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ goldenring]a shows an image of a representative au ab interferometer . more than ten devices of different size exhibited similar behaviour ( more results in the supplementary information ) . the ab ring is connected to two @xmath4100  nm long side arms , which each split into two leads . </S>",
    "<S> this device layout allows for measuring the differential resistance ( @xmath5 ) in the conventional , local configuration ( fig@xmath6  [ goldenring]a(red ) ) . the local signal shown in the upper panel of fig@xmath6  </S>",
    "<S> [ goldenring]b shows clear ab oscillations , see fig@xmath6 1c , superimposed on a reproducible background of universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf )  @xcite . the corresponding fourier spectrum ( fig@xmath6  [ goldenring]d ) clearly reveals the ab period @xmath1 , as well as higher harmonics up to @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to @xmath8 , we have also measured the _ nonlocal _ </S>",
    "<S> differential resistance @xmath9 according to the scheme in fig@xmath6  [ goldenring]a(blue ) . </S>",
    "<S> classically , one expects to measure a zero signal in this configuration ( or exponentially small according to the van der pauw theorem  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the quantum coherent transport regime , the signal may be nonzero  @xcite as the electron wave function , dynamically delocalized in the system , can connect the current and voltage probes within a distance of a few coherence lengths . </S>",
    "<S> indeed a nonlocal ab effect has been measured in _ ballistic _ </S>",
    "<S> rings  @xcite , while for diffusive metals the presence of an au ring side - connected to a nanowire was detected in the oscillations of the local resistance  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , nonlocal ab oscillations have never been observed in diffusive metallic rings and are often neglected in the theoretical estimations  @xcite . in our diffusive ring , with the design shown in fig@xmath6  [ goldenring]a , we do however observe very clear nonlocal ab oscillations ( fig@xmath6  [ goldenring]c ) around a zero average ( lower panel of fig@xmath6  [ goldenring]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier spectrum shows the same four harmonics as for the local signal , but with roughly half the amplitude ( fig@xmath6  [ goldenring]d , lower panel ) .        for both the local and nonlocal configurations the amplitude of these fourier peaks follows a clear exponential decay in the harmonic index @xmath10 ( as shown in the insets of fig@xmath6  [ goldenring]d ) , as the path length scales with @xmath10 , corresponding to the number of times that the electron encircles the ring . </S>",
    "<S> this decay thus provides a direct measure of the electron coherence length @xmath11  @xcite . using the power law @xmath12 , expected for a diffusive interferometer  @xcite , where @xmath13 is the ring circumference </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath141.5  @xmath15 m for both the local and nonlocal configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath11 is consistent with values found from weak localization and ucf measurements in mesoscopic au structures at millikelvin temperatures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other similar rings ( supplementary information ) show the same trend with @xmath11 = 1 - 2  @xmath15 m , independent of sample size and temperature ( below 1  k ) , in agreement with other studies for gold  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that both the local and nonlocal interference are equally suppressed by decoherence inside the ring . </S>",
    "<S> decoherence inside the side arms is only relevant for the nonlocal signal , leading to an additional damping @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total length of the two side arms together  @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the nonlocal ab oscillations is smaller than the local ab oscillations , as seen in fig@xmath6  [ goldenring ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with other studies on nonlocal interference  @xcite . to study the damping effect of the side arms on the nonlocal ab oscillations in more detail , we measured @xmath18 and @xmath8 in the multi - terminal interferometer shown in fig@xmath6  [ fishbone]a , in which @xmath17 can be varied .    </S>",
    "<S> clear ab oscillations are visible for @xmath17 = 200  nm ( @xmath19 ) in both @xmath8 ( @xmath20 , red plot in fig@xmath6  [ fishbone]b ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath21 , blue plot in fig@xmath6  [ fishbone]c ) . for @xmath8 the amplitude of the ab oscillations does not significantly change when the side - arms length @xmath17 increases , see fig@xmath6  [ fishbone]d . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the amplitude of the nonlocal ab oscillations is strongly suppressed with increasing @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the damping of the nonlocal oscillations can be described by the power low @xmath22 , see fig@xmath6  [ fishbone]d , where @xmath23  nm is the characteristic length scale of the damping . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this damping is about three times faster than the theoretical expectation for a nonlocal measurement ( @xmath24 )  @xcite , which would give a value of @xmath25 m , but still consistent with the damping measured in the ucf of au nanowires  @xcite .     * </S>",
    "<S> consequence of the reduction of the amount of quantum conduction channels in the side arm . </S>",
    "<S> a * scheme of the simple 4-terminal ab interferometer with a detailed representation of the second node of the interferometer in which the two electronic paths of the ring ( green and blue arrows ) interfere generating the two phase - correlated output channels represented by the red arrows ( solid and dashed ) . </S>",

    "<S> d * , comparison between the 4-terminal local ( red ) and nonlocal ( blue ) resistances simulated as a function of the magnetic ab phase @xmath26 for the ab ring with one single - channel side arm . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we ascribe this large discrepancy to a loss of dynamical delocalization in the nonlocal geometry . to catch the essential physics describing this loss we use the landauer - bttiker ( lb ) formalism  @xcite to model the magnetoresistance of the device first in the few - channel regime , and </S>",
    "<S> then we extend the argument to our multi - channel diffusive experimental system . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoresistance of the ring , represented in fig@xmath6  [ model]a and modelled in the single - channel approximation ( see methods ) , well describes the fundamental characteristics of the experimentally observed @xmath8 and @xmath18 : a positive @xmath8 exhibiting ab oscillations , and @xmath18 oscillating between positive and negative values with a similar amplitude ( @xmath28 ) , as shown in fig@xmath6  [ model]b . </S>",
    "<S> this picture changes drastically when modelling the same ring with an additional side arm , as represented in fig@xmath6  [ model]c . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of the one - dimensional , i.e. single - channel side arm , results in the complete quenching of all @xmath18 , while the behaviour of @xmath8 is only weakly affected , see fig@xmath6  [ model]d . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this geometrical localization , imposed by the side arm , is essentially the origin of the suppression observed in the nonlocal interference and reduces when the side arm is composed of more than one channel , as is expected in the diffusive case .    </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis is also in good agreement with experimental observations of the nonlocal ab effect in ballistic systems  @xcite , in which the nonlocal ab oscillations have been reported only for several transport channels . in our metallic devices , the side arms </S>",
    "<S> are composed of a multitude of interacting channels due to the diffusive electron motion , and the probability that scattering merges two otherwise distinct conduction channels into a single one ( event represented in the scheme of fig@xmath6[model]c ) is high . </S>",
    "<S> the measured signal results from the average of all the possible diffusive electron paths . in this average the paths that experience such a reduction do not contribute to interference , as demonstrated in our model . due to the random distribution of electron paths in a diffusive metal , the probability for this event to occur </S>",
    "<S> is expected to scale exponentially with the length of the side arm ( @xmath29 , where @xmath27 is the characteristic length scale of this event ) . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal signal is damped within the same length scale ( @xmath30 ) , additionally to the conventional damping induced by decoherence ( @xmath31)@xcite . this behaviour is in agreement with the strong exponential damping of the @xmath18 shown in fig@xmath6  [ fishbone]d from which we can estimate the characteristic length @xmath32  nm .    </S>",
    "<S> we have thus shown a new aspect of the _ dynamical _ nonlocality of electrons in a quantum nanoscale circuit that is solely governed by geometric aspects and not by external measurement . understanding this geometrical constraint is essential for the optimal design of any quantum circuit based on the dynamical nonlocality of the electron . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as deduced from our model , the specific link found between geometry and nonlocality is not limited by the diffusive transport regime of our experiment , nor by the specific quantum wave - particle used ( in our case electrons ) but , as other important geometrical constrains  @xcite , is a universal property of quantum dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that these results will trigger further investigation of the fundamental properties of quantum dynamics and of its application in nanoscale quantum circuits . </S>"
