    "we consider the problem in figure  [ fig : mac ] , in which @xmath0 users design matrices @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an @xmath3 matrix , designed by the @xmath4 user , with full column rank @xmath5 .",
    "a destination obtains the matrix @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 is an @xmath8 diagonal matrix with random diagonal entries , and the set of all random coefficients is drawn from a continuous joint distribution .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath9 is the maximum rank that the matrix @xmath10 can have .",
    "however , by a careful design , one can reduce the rank of this matrix .",
    "in particular , the question that we address in this work is : under what conditions on the design of the matrices @xmath1 will the matrix @xmath10 lose rank by @xmath11 almost surely , i.e. , @xmath12 , while each of the matrices @xmath1 has full column rank ?    the aforementioned problem arises naturally when understanding the fundamentals of interference management in wireless networks , in particular for the case where no information about the channel state is assumed to be available at the transmitters except for the knowledge about the network topology . in this setting ,",
    "the @xmath0 users in figure [ fig : mac ] represent transmitters that are interfering at a single receiver .",
    "the matrix @xmath2 represents the beamforming matrix at the @xmath4 transmitter and the @xmath13 diagonal element of the matrix @xmath7 represents the channel coefficient in the @xmath13 time slot .",
    "the column span of the matrix @xmath10 represents the space of the received interference .",
    "the aforementioned problem is that of determining the conditions on the beamforming matrices that result in an alignment of the interference caused by users @xmath14 to @xmath0 in a subspace whose dimension is at most @xmath15 .",
    "another motivating example arises in recommendation systems , where for a fixed set of items , each matrix @xmath2 represents the ratings given by the @xmath4 group of users .",
    "each row represents one user s ratings for the set of items , and each diagonal element of @xmath7 represents a random scaling factor that reflects the user s own bias . for example , one user can give a rating of @xmath16 to his most favorite movie and @xmath17 for his least favorite while another user can have a highest rating of @xmath18 and a lowest rating of @xmath19 . the problem in this setting would be to understand conditions on the ratings of each user group that result in a rank loss of the ensemble .",
    "understanding conditions of rank loss in this application is useful for completion algorithms that recover missing ratings . in other words ,",
    "the answer of our question in this setting specifies the structure of matrix entries which suffice to complete the entire rating matrix .    as a special case of this problem",
    ", one can consider each @xmath2 being only a column vector .",
    "this is equivalent to the case where instead of each row , each individual element is scaled by a random coefficient . in this case , the problem can be shown to have a combinatorial structure , depending on the position of zero / non - zero elements of @xmath2 s .",
    "in particular , it can be verified that in this case , the ensemble matrix @xmath10 will lose rank by @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) if and only if there does not exist a matching of size greater than @xmath15 between rows and columns of @xmath10 , where a row is connected to a column if and only if the element with the corresponding row and column indices is non - zero ( see e.g.,@xcite and also the zippel - schwartz lemma @xcite ) .",
    "however , once @xmath2 s are not column vectors , the problem becomes much more complicated since there is a structure in the random scaling ; elements of the same row in each matrix are scaled by the same coefficient .    in this paper",
    ", we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition for rank - loss of the matrix @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , we determine under what condition on @xmath2 s , the matrix @xmath10 loses rank by @xmath11 almost surely .",
    "the proof consists of a succession of equivalence steps . in the first step ,",
    "we connect the rank of @xmath10 to the rank of the union of certain matroids .",
    "this is first done by expanding the determinants of specific submatrices of @xmath10 and then using the zippel - schwartz lemma to express the almost - sure rank loss condition of @xmath10 in terms of the products of the determinants of certain submatrices of @xmath2 s being equal to zero .",
    "then we use the notion of _ sparse subspaces _ in order to connect the rank loss of @xmath10 to the column span of @xmath2 s and then to the rank loss of the union of carefully - defined matroids . after representing the rank condition of @xmath10 in terms of the rank loss of the union of certain matroids , in the second step , we make use of the matroid union theorem .",
    "this theorem enables us to derive an equivalent condition on the structure of @xmath21 for the rank loss of the union of matroids .    in the final step of the proof ,",
    "we simplify the above condition by constructing appropriate bipartite graphs in which one partite set represents the column vectors of a carefully chosen set of bases for the column span of each of the matrices @xmath21 and the other partite set represents the row indices .",
    "a column vector vertex is connected to a row vertex if and only if the vector has a non - zero entry in the corresponding row .",
    "we use a variation of the hall s marriage theorem to reach a final condition expressed through matching sizes on the constructed graphs .    as an application of the derived rank - loss condition",
    ", we utilize the result in the context of the topological interference management problem .",
    "this problem focuses on the scenario in which interference management primarily relies on a coarse knowledge about channel states in the network , namely the `` topology '' of the network .",
    "network topology simply refers to the 1-bit feedback information for each link between each transmitter and each receiver , indicating whether or not the signal of the transmitter is received above the noise floor at the corresponding receiver .",
    "there have been several prior works in the literature that have considered similar scenarios . in  @xcite , it is assumed that transmitters are aware of the network topology as well as the actual channel gains within a local neighborhood ; the concept of normalized capacity was introduced by characterizing the maximum achievable rate using this channel knowledge as a fraction of the achievable rate using global channel state information . in @xcite , the authors considered a more restrictive scenario , called topological interference management ( tim ) , in which the transmitters are only aware of the topology with no information about the channel coefficients .",
    "it has been shown that if the channel gains in the network remain constant for a sufficiently large time , then topological interference management is closely connected to the classical index coding problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and via this connection , a class of linear interference management schemes has been introduced which rely on the network topology knowledge to align the interference over time at unintended receivers . in  @xcite , the authors considered a class of retransmission - based schemes that only allows transmitters to resend their symbols in order to assist with the neutralization of interference at the receivers .",
    "besides their simplicity , these schemes are robust to channel variations over time and were shown to be optimal in terms of the symmetric degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) in many classes of topologies via the outer bounds developed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use our derived rank loss condition in order to solve two problems in the topological interference management framework . in this",
    "setting , figure  [ fig : mac ] can be seen as a set of @xmath0 transmitters causing interference at a destination , and the considered rank - loss problem can be seen as reducing the dimension of the subspace occupied by interference at the receiver through careful design of the beamforming matrices at the transmitters .",
    "we first characterize the `` best '' topologies for topological interference management ; i.e. , the topologies for which half symmetric dof is achievable for the case of time - varying channels .",
    "it is easy to see that in topologies with at least one interference link , the symmetric dof is upper bounded by @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the topologies in which half symmetric dof is achievable represent the best topologies that one can hope for ( from the degrees - of - freedom perspective ) .",
    "for the case where the channel gains in the network are assumed to remain constant for a long - enough period of time , the necessary and sufficient condition on the network topology for achieving half symmetric dof was characterized in @xcite .",
    "for the case of case of time - varying channels , a sufficient condition for the achievability of half symmetric dof was derived in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we close the gap in the results on half symmetric dof by introducing a necessary and sufficient condition under which the symmetric dof of @xmath22 is achievable for the case of time - varying channels ( i.e. , without requiring the channels to remain fixed for a long enough time ) .",
    "second , we use our condition to characterize the linear symmetric degrees of freedom ( dof ) for a class of network topologies with exclusive interference sets .",
    "this helps to resolve the characterization of the symmetric dof for a set of previously open problems considered in  @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath0 matrices @xmath1 , where each matrix @xmath23 $ ] has size @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( we use @xmath26 $ ] to denote the set @xmath27 for any positive integer @xmath0 ) . without loss of generality , we assume that each matrix is full - column rank , since the linearly - dependent columns can be removed from each matrix",
    ". furthermore , consider @xmath0 diagonal matrices @xmath28 , each of size @xmath29 , where their diagonal elements are drawn from a joint continuous distribution .    in this paper ,",

    "setting , the main goal is to characterize the linear symmetric degrees of freedom for general network topologies .",
    "there have been multiple attempts in the literature to resolve this problem . in particular , in @xcite it was shown that if the channel gains in the network remain constant for a sufficiently large time , then topological interference management is closely connected to the classical index coding problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and via this connection , a class of linear interference management schemes has been introduced which rely on the network topology knowledge to align the interference over time at unintended receivers . furthermore , in  @xcite , the authors considered a class of retransmission - based schemes that only allows transmitters to resend their symbols in order to assist with the neutralization of interference at the receivers .",
    "besides their simplicity , these schemes are robust to channel variations over time and were shown to be optimal in terms of the symmetric degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) in many classes of topologies via the outer bounds developed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the authors in @xcite have characterized a necessary and sufficient condition for a topology under which interference avoidance can achieve the whole dof region .    in the following two sections ,",
    "we use our derived rank loss condition in order to address two problems in the topological interference management framework .",
    "first , in section [ sec : best ] , we characterize the `` best '' topologies for topological interference management ; i.e. , the topologies for which half linear symmetric dof is achievable for the case of time - varying channels . for the case",
    "where the channel gains in the network are assumed to remain constant for a long - enough period of time , the necessary and sufficient condition on the network topology for achieving half linear symmetric dof was characterized in @xcite . for the case of case of time - varying channels ,",
    "a sufficient condition for the achievability of half linear symmetric dof was derived in @xcite . in the next section , we close the gap by introducing a necessary and sufficient condition under which the half linear symmetric dof is achievable for the case of time - varying channels ( i.e. , without requiring the channels to remain fixed for a long enough time ) . as for the second problem , in section [ sec : nonoverlapping ]",
    "we characterize the linear symmetric degrees of freedom for a class of network topologies with exclusive interference alignment sets .",
    "this helps to resolve the characterization of the linear symmetric dof for a set of previously open problems considered in  @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we use theorem  [ thm : main ] to identify network topologies where a linear symmetric dof of @xmath22 is achievable .",
    "it is easy to see that in topologies where at least one transmitter is interfering at an undesired receiver , the symmetric dof is upper bounded by @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the topologies in which half symmetric dof is achievable represent the `` best '' topologies that one can hope for ( from the degrees - of - freedom perspective ) .",
    "we start by making the following definition of _ reduced conflict graphs_.    [ redgraph ] the reduced conflict graph of a @xmath0-user interference network is a directed graph @xmath231 with @xmath232 . as for the edges , vertex @xmath213 is connected to vertex @xmath214 ( i.e. , @xmath233 ) if and only if @xmath234 and the following two conditions hold :    1 .",

    ", we characterize the best topologies in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : halfdof ] for a @xmath0-user interference network with arbitrary topology , half linear symmetric dof can be achieved if and only if the reduced conflict graph of the network is bipartite .",
    "[ remk : avoidance ] it is easy to see that the interference avoidance scheme , which schedules the users in an independent set of the regular conflict graph of the network , can achieve half symmetric dof if and only if the regular conflict graph of the network is bipartite .",
    "since the reduced conflict graph is the same as the regular conflict graph with the removal of edges that do not satisfy condition @xmath237 in definition  [ redgraph ] , there exist topologies where the reduced conflict graph is bipartite but the regular conflict graph is not bipartite .",
    "one such example topology is illustrated in figure [ ex_gain ] together with its regular and reduced conflict graphs in figure [ conf_graph ] .",
    "0.3       0.3    the black edges are the edges in the reduced conflict graph and the dashed red edges are the ones that exist in the regular conflict graph but are removed in the reduced conflict graph .",
    "it is clear that the reduced conflict graph is bipartite ( with the two partite sets being @xmath238 and @xmath239 ) , hence @xmath240 is achievable in this topology .",
    "however the addition of the dashed red edges in the regular conflict graph removes the bipartiteness property of the graph and therefore interference avoidance can not achieve half symmetric dof in this topology .",
    "in fact , since the chromatic number of the regular conflict graph in figure [ conf_graph ] is 3 , interference avoidance can only achieve a symmetric dof of @xmath241 .",
    "the suboptimality of interference avoidance can also be seen as a result of the network topology in figure [ ex_gain ] not being chordal @xcite .    in @xcite , a linear scheme based on aligning the interference at unintended receivers",
    "was considered .",
    "the alignment scheme relies on the channel remaining constant for a long time ( large coherence time ) .",
    "it was shown that half symmetric dof is achievable if and only if there is no conflict between any two nodes that cause interference at a third receiver , i.e. , there is no internal conflict within an alignment set .",
    "it is easy to show that the condition in theorem [ thm : halfdof ] implies the absence of internal conflicts but the opposite is not true ; this is consistent with intuition as we make no assumption on the coherence time of the channel .",
    "interestingly , it is shown in  @xcite that the topologies for which interference alignment can achieve half symmetric dof while retransmission can not achieve it comprise a negligible fraction of possible topologies in a heterogeneous network scenario of practical interest .",

    "this implies that @xmath430 has no intersection with @xmath427 and therefore with @xmath398 ( except for the zero vector ) and @xmath431 , suggesting that @xmath0 is the actual desired subset of @xmath47 .",
