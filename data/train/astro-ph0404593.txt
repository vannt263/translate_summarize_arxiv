    "the observed ratio of restframe  uv emission from 2200@xmath13000   ( thereafter , ( uv ) ) to that of the 2800   resonance doublet has been widely used to estimate fe / mg abundance ratios in blrs of quasars ( wills et al .",

    "1996 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "meanwhile , there is some observational evidence that narrow line agn have higher metalicities compared to other low redshift agn ( shemmer & netzer 2002 )",
    ".    measurements of ( uv)/ emission ratios in quasars show large scatter from 1 to 20 , and no redshift dependency up to @xmath3 ( iwamuro et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in a recent paper ,",
    "we have used a sophisticated 830-level model for to investigate abundance and microturbulence effects on these ratios ( verner et al .",
    "our modeling indicates strong emission from 1000 to 6800   , and reveals that ( uv)/ ratios ( at @xmath4 = 10@xmath5  @xmath6 and total hydrogen column density @xmath7 = 10@xmath8@xmath9 ) increase from 5 to 30 for microturbulence @xmath10 varied from 1 to 100 km  s@xmath11 , while an increase in abundance by factor 10 only increases the same ratios by factor 2 .",
    "we have further found that a reasonable range of microturbulence is between 5@xmath110 km  s@xmath11 , and optical emission flux from 4000@xmath16000   is more sensitive to abundance than is the ( uv ) band .",
    "conversely , the ( uv ) band is more sensitive to microturbulence than the optical band .    in this paper",
    "we continue our study of emission line formation in blrs of quasars in an attempt to explain the nature of the large observed scatter .",
    "since abundances , density , and excitation conditions are ill - determined in blrs , we have performed a set of numerical calculations to study the effects of varying hydrogen and ionizing photon densities .",
    "we have split emission into three wavelength bands that are most commonly measured in observations : ( uv ) ( 2000@xmath13000   ) , ( opt1 ) ( 3000@xmath13500   ) , and ( opt2 ) ( 4000@xmath16000   ) .",
    "the major goal is to ascertain if ( uv)/ , ( uv)/(opt1 ) , and ( uv)/(opt2 ) emission ratios present different trends due to non - abundance factors .",
    "although many factors contribute to increase emission fluxes , the effects can be separated by using several ratios simultaneously .",
    "spectra of quasars at redshifts up to @xmath12 are especially valuable , since they should exhibit no elemental overabundances , and the effects of physical parameters such as hydrogen density , ionizing luminosity , and even microturburbulence can be easily explored .",
    "we just showed general trends , while a detailed comparison between model and observations for each quasar spectrum should be done individually .",
    "the figures in our paper represent calculations for a range of reasonable blr conditions , but do not cover the full range of possible variables and should be used with extreme care by observers .",
    "such comparison will provide the first fundamental test of the emission model .",
    "this consistency check is a necessary step before one can confidently apply this methodology to quasars over a wide range of redshift as a means to probe galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "the required data for quasars up to @xmath12 can be obtained with stis and nicmos aboard the hst .",
    "why quasars at moderate to high redshift exhibit strong uv emission is one the unsolved problems of agn studies .",
    "the extremely complex energy level structure ( johansson 1978 ) of makes it very difficult to obtain all the experimental transition probabilities and , therefore , calculate line intensities .",
    "several hundreds of transitions of must be considered , many with large optical depths .",
    "our earlier model for fe@xmath13 included 371 energy levels below 11.6 ev ( verner et al .",
    "1999),which was incorporated into photoionization code cloudy ( ferland et al . 1998 ) . even though the upper energy levels in the current model ( verner et al .",
    "2003a ) have been extended only about 2.5 ev higher compared to the old model , the total number of transitions has increased dramatically from 68,638 to 344,035 .",
    "the model includes 830 levels up to 14.1 ev .",
    "this increase in transitions is mainly due to increased density of energy levels at higher energy .",
    "the energy level data are from johansson ( 2004 ) .",
    "the large number of lines form several distinct emission bands recognized in early observational work ( e.g. greenstein & schmidt 1964 ; wampler & oke 1967 ; sargent 1968 ; netzer & wills 1983 ) and theoretical modeling ( wnw85 ; verner et al .",
    "the 830-level ion model is far more accurate than the previous best efforts .",
    "the increased number of fe@xmath14 energy levels influences not only the spectrum but also the whole energy budget , temperature , and consequently line emission of other elements in the emitting region .",
    "however , an in - depth study of the new theoretical emission spectrum will not be given in this paper .    for several reasons ,",
    "we have followed a more general approach and considered three wide bands in our calculations , namely ( uv ) ,  ( opt1 ) , and  ( opt2 ) . the biggest unknown factor in predicting ( uv ) and emission is the magnitude of the velocity of turbulence in blrs .",
    "whether it is on the order of 10  km  s@xmath11 , 100  km  s@xmath11 or even higher is not at all clear ( alexander & netzer 1997 ; murray & chiang 1997 ) .",
    "also , the emission in blrs is present over a wide wavelength range from 1000   to the ir . because of the velocity broadening , presumably due to orbital motion",
    ", the emission can be characterized by a pseudo - continuum superposed upon the intrinsic power - law spectrum of the quasar .    for the adopted parameter range ,",
    "we have investigated how hydrogen density and photon density of hydrogen ionizing photons at the illuminated face alter the intrinsic emission ratios of ( uv)/ , ( uv)/(opt1 ) and ( uv)/(opt2 ) . for our calculations ,",
    "we have used the same energy level structure and model as in verner et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "we have looked for the variations of ( uv)/ emission ratios in blrs assuming solar abundance for a wide range of hydrogen density , @xmath4 = 10 @xmath15 @xmath6 , and total column density , @xmath7 = 10@xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "we further assume that the flux of hydrogen ionizing photons at the illuminated face is 10@xmath16@xmath9 s@xmath11 .",
    "these parameters for blr conditions are within the range of values taken from verner et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and verner ( 2000 ) .",
    "we employ the characteristic agn continuum described in korista et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which consists of a uv bump peaking near 44 ev , a @xmath17 x - ray power law , and a uv to optical spectral index , @xmath18 .",
    "our knowledge about turbulence is very limited .",
    "consequently , in our initial calculations of emission , we have produced models with microturbulence with velocities of @xmath19 and 100  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "we find that the strength of the ( uv ) emission is very sensitive to microturbulence .",
    "non - zero turbulence velocities help to explain the observed smooth shape of ( uv ) , and a @xmath20  km  s@xmath11 makes the model fit reasonable ( verner et al .",
    "2003b ) emission strengths forming a pseudo - continuum ( figure 1 ) at @xmath20  km  s@xmath11 . even in emission lines , this must be a curve - of - growth effect .",
    "stronger lines ( higher a - values ) should have larger equivalent width and be more sensitive to microturbulence than weaker lines .",
    "figure 2 shows plots of ( uv)/ ratios versus hydrogen density and flux of ionizing photons at @xmath21 and 10  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "we see from figure 2 that at low flux , @xmath22  @xmath9  s@xmath11 , the ( uv)/ @xmath23 and it does not depend on turbulent velocity .",
    "the increase of microturbulence works similar to a hydrogen density increase , and large ( uv)/ ratios are predicted at smaller densities .",
    "although solar abundance is assumed throughout , the possible range of values of ( uv)/ are quite large , from 1 to 40 ( fig .",
    "2 , @xmath20  km  s@xmath11 ) . fig .",
    "2 also demonstrates that the same ( uv)/ ratios may indicate a wide range of physical conditions . at densities below @xmath4",
    "= 10@xmath24 @xmath6 , the dependence on luminosity displays a different trend compared to that at larger densities . the ( uv)/ ratio reaches a maximum near @xmath4 = 10 @xmath25 @xmath6 . in quasars ,",
    "if hydrogen density is less than @xmath4 = 10@xmath24 @xmath6 , all ( uv)/ values are less than 8 .",
    "small ( uv)/ ratios ( up to 2 ) are possible indicators of two different regimes : a ) high luminosity conditions at small densities ( @xmath4 @xmath26 10 @xmath24 @xmath6 ) or b ) low - luminosity conditions over a wide density range . in the latter case ,",
    "these ratios are insensitive to density variations .",
    "the left upper corner in figure 2 corresponds to low hydrogen density and large ionizing flux , and shows that iron and magnesium are effectively more highly ionized , beyond and .",
    "the large ionizing flux at high hydrogen density is insufficient to ionize .",
    "instead , this combination increases the strength of the ( uv ) emission band relative to the doublet emission . as a result ,",
    "large ( uv)/ ratios ( from 8 to 40 ) are predicted for large hydrogen density    @xmath27 @xmath6 and ionizing fluxes @xmath28@xmath9 s@xmath11 . if the scatter observed at any given redshift is due to variations in density and luminosity , it may well mask any abundance effect .    as we have already shown ( verner et al .",
    "2003a ) , the ( uv)/(optical ) ratio is less sensitive to microturbulence velocity than is the ( uv)/ ratio .",
    "figures 3 and 4 illustrate this conclusion for both ratios , namely ( uv)/(opt1 ) and ( uv)/(opt2 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows how the ( uv ) and ( opt1 ) emission varies versus physical conditions at @xmath21 and 10  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath29  km  s@xmath11 , the ( uv)/(opt1 ) ratios vary from @xmath23 to 30 . however , there is a wide plateau with almost constant ( uv)/(opt1 ) ratio @xmath30 . at low ionizing flux with increasing density ,",
    "( uv ) dominates over ( opt1 ) .",
    "ratios @xmath31 show a dependence on physical conditions and are more suitable to use as a diagnostic of ionizing photon flux and hydrogen number density .",
    "the ( uv)/(opt2 ) ratios exhibit a much stronger dependence on density than either ( uv)/ or ( uv)/(opt1 ) .",
    "the plateau where ratios are insensitive to physical conditions is much smaller than that in the previous case .",
    "similarly , the ( uv ) dominates over ( opt2 ) emission strength in the domain of high density and low ionizing flux ( fig . 4 at @xmath29  km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the bands include different transitions .",
    "the ( uv ) band includes the strongest uv multiplets from uv1 to uv5 .",
    "the ( opt1 ) band includes optical multiplets 1 , 4 - 7 and ( opt2 ) optical multiplets 21 , 22 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 35 - 38 .",
    "uv multiplets are due to transitions from higher energy upper levels compared to those of the optical multiplets .",
    "therefore , uv multiplets become stronger with increasing density due to increase of upper level populations , and ( uv)/(opt1 ) , ( uv)/(opt2 ) ratios become larger .",
    "while no single ratio can constrain physical conditions , their combination can provide valuable diagnostics of density and ionizing flux .",
    "if our assumption about microturbulence is correct , we might well observe large ( uv)/ values ( @xmath32 ) at solar abundance .",
    "for the same physical conditions , ( uv)/(opt1 ) ratios will be in a range of @xmath33 and ( uv)/(opt2 ) in a range of @xmath34 .",
    "likewise , large scatter in ( uv)/ , from 1 to 30 , can be explained by non - abundance factors , where both ionizing luminosity and hydrogen density are responsible .",
    "values of ( uv)/ @xmath35 10 are most probably achieved at hydrogen densities , larger than @xmath4 = 10 @xmath24 @xmath6 at high ionizing flux .",
    "it is highly desirable to develop an observational template to derive mg / fe abundances .",
    "yet , it is not clear that any single template can be constructed that would be appropriate for all quasar spectra .",
    "a combined observational and detailed modeling program is needed to determine the answer to this question .",
    "currently , two types of templates have been used .",
    "one template is based upon the i  zw  1 spectrum ( e.g. vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ; dietrich et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) and the other is based on an average quasar template ( wnw85 , iwamuro et al .",
    "our comparisons between model and observations reveal that the i  zw  1 template by vestergaard & wilkes ( 2001 ) is not generally applicable to blrs due to variable emission contributions contaminating measurements of the doublet .",
    "the contributions of fe ii lines are easily seen in our modeling of blrs .",
    "failure to account for this contamination to the emission can lead to erroneous emission estimates . assuming @xmath36 , the values of ( 2720 @xmath1 2860  )/ are 1.3 , 0.8 and 0.2 , for @xmath37 @xmath6 , @xmath38 @xmath6 , and @xmath39 @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "thus , errors in the flux can be of factor 2 and even higher , if the contribution of lines is not accounted for .",
    "naturally , the larger measured ( uv)/ ratio the more affected by the emission ( fig .",
    "the emission spectrum of in blrs spans a wide wavelength range from the uv to ir .",
    "it affects not only line intensity measurements of other ions , but the continuum determinations as well .",
    "based on the model predictions , it is possible to define a narrow ( @xmath40   ) window in quasar spectra near 3,050   , where little or no emission is present . in case of the strong ( uv ) band , the emission produces a pseudo - continuum that extends to wavelengths as short as 1,000   .",
    "how much the ( uv ) pseudo - continuum affects the 1,000   @xmath1 2,000   range , depends on microturbulence and hydrogen density , and is the subject of future investigation . if any of these windows are used to determine the underlying quasar continuum , it must be done with caution .    in most studies of quasars , even at low redshift , fe is thought to have super - solar abundances .",
    "wnw85 were the first who recognized that ultraviolet emission contributed to resonance doublet",
    ". however , in their analysis they still needed an iron overabundance of approximately 3 times solar to explain the high ( uv)/ ratios . from comparisons of figures @xmath41 we can deduce the physical conditions in blrs .",
    "the ionizing flux at the face of the cloud is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is total ionizing luminosity . since we can easily estimate the ionizing luminosity from observations",
    ", we can calculate the number of ionizing photons at any distance from the central source , and hence obtain a distance for the blr from the central engine .",
    "we selected five objects from wnw85 with measured and ( uv ) , ( opt1 ) , and ( opt2 ) emission bands .",
    "we then compared these measurements with figures 2@xmath14 to deduce hydrogen densities and ionizing photon fluxes for the blrs of the quasars .",
    "finally , we have ascertained if enhanced fe abundances are required to explain the observations . where possible",
    ", we have used the values corrected for intrinsic and foreground reddening .",
    "the results are given in table 1 .",
    "column 1 shows the name of the object , where the three following columns present the observed emission ratios similar to that calculated in our model .",
    "the next two columns list hydrogen densities and ionizing photon fluxes .",
    "the last two columns give photon luminosities and derived sizes of emitting regions .",
    "when we compare these results with the wnw85 models , we find no iron overabundance at redshifts @xmath44 .",
    "the best fits are obtained within reasonable hydrogen densities , @xmath45 @xmath6 .",
    "the much larger number of levels used in the photoionization calculations provides more sensitivity to the radiation field , and enables us to explain the much larger observed ( uv)/ ratios .",
    "quasar luminosities were derived from energy fluxes measured by the asca x - ray observations ( the tartarus database ; turner & nandra , http://tartarus.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) for q0405@xmath1123 and q1226 + 023 , and from the rosat radio loud catalog ( brinkmann et al . 1997 ) for the remainder of the objects .",
    "these were converted into 0.0136@xmath110 kev number fluxes using the power law indices , and then into number photon luminosity assuming h@xmath46  =  71 km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 ( bennett et al . 2003 ) and q@xmath46  =  1 .    note that derived hydrogen densities vary by factor 1000 from one quasar to another .",
    "yet there is a wide range of ionizing luminosities .",
    "meanwhile all derived distances of the emitting region vary by only factor of 6 .",
    "is it something common for all quasars , or are these distances fortuitously similar to each other only in this small sample ?",
    "future reverberation mapping results for quasars over a range of luminosity would provide important comparison with the model predictions ( c.f .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter k2000 ) .",
    "we have one quasar in common with the k2000 sample , namely pg 1226 .",
    "its blr distance based on reverberation method is @xmath47 7 times larger than that in our model .",
    "note that the large distance for pg 1226 is not typical for quasars in the k2000 sample , contrary to the distance derived in our model . on the other hand , the source for",
    "the discrepancy between the r found in our work for pg1226 + 023 and that obtained from reverberation mapping in k2000 may be quasar variability .",
    "we have used our sample just for demonstration purposes and assumed a constant @xmath10 = 5  km  s@xmath11 for all quasars . by varying @xmath10",
    "we can achieve even better agreement between the observed and predicted ( uv)/ ratios without any iron overabundance ( verner et al .",
    "by applying our new 830-level model for fe@xmath14 ion , which is incorporated into detailed photoionization calculations , we have probed the feasibility of using the strong emission spectrum seen in quasars as a diagnostic tool for the physical conditions in blrs .",
    "the emission ratios show different trends as functions of the same parameters , hydrogen number density , and ionizing photon flux .",
    "we have found that the combination of the ratios is especially important in determining the hydrogen density , the ionizing flux and the radial distances to blrs in quasars .",
    "we conclude that abundance is not the only factor that makes emission strong .",
    "moreover , fe abundance does not seem to be the dominant factor determining the strength of emission .",
    "our modeling indicates that microturbulence , density , and radiation field have important roles and also lead to preferential strengthening of the uv emission .",
    "our large model atom used in photoionization calculations predicts that large ( uv)/ ratios are not necessarily due to high iron abundance .",
    "the ( uv)/ diagram ( figure 2 ) demonstrates that the ( uv)/ ratios can have the same value over a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "this implies that the averaging of large numbers of quasars spectra may lead to properties of quasars that do not exist .",
    "since evolutionary models predict no iron overabundances for z @xmath26 1 , observations to detect the optical iron band at these redshifts will be beneficial to calibrate the model assuming a solar abundance for iron .",
    "such research must be accomplished with stis and nicmos aboard the hst to properly span the wavelength range where emission is seen and to obtain constraints on the most uncertain parameter , microturbulence .",
    "our emission band analysis demonstrates that has a great potential for becoming an important diagnostic tool of the physical conditions in blr s of quasars .",
    "we suggest three emission ratios , which can be used to obtain hydrogen density , flux of hydrogen - ionizing photons , microturbulent velocities , and distances to blr s .",
    "in this paper we have shown that even in the limited space of parameters ( ionizing flux and hydrogen density ) exact fits to observed spectra exist .",
    "the full investigation of our model in the whole parameter space including dust properties , balmer continuum , and many others will be a subject of coming papers .",
    "such investigation will provide all blr physical parameters with the determined uncertainties .",
