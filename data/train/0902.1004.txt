    "considerable evidence @xcite has accumulated suggesting that at least 70% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of an exotic , negative - pressure component , called dark energy .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "a parameter of considerable importance is the equation of state ( eos ) of the dark energy component , defined as the ratio of its pressure to its density : w = p_de/_de .",
    "observations constrain @xmath4 to be very close to @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath4 is assumed to be constant , then @xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a variety of models have been proposed in which @xmath4 is time varying .",
    "a common approach is to use a scalar field as the dark energy component .",
    "the class of models in which the scalar field is canonical is dubbed quintessence @xcite and has been extensively studied .    a related , yet somewhat different approach is phantom dark energy , i.e. , a component for which @xmath9 . the simplest way to realize such a component is to use a scalar field with a negative kinetic term in its lagrangian , as first proposed by caldwell @xcite .",
    "such models have well - known problems @xcite , but nevertheless have been widely studied as potential dark energy candidates @xcite .    given the considerable freedom that exists in choosing the potential function of the scalar field , it is useful to develop general expressions for the evolution of @xmath4 which cover a wide range of models .",
    "one such approach is to begin with the observational result that @xmath4 for dark energy is very close to @xmath7 today , and to assume that @xmath4 was always close to @xmath7 in the redshift regime of interest . with this assumption",
    ", one can assume an expanding background that is very close to @xmath10cdm and solve for the evolution of the scalar field for this case .",
    "this assumption alone is not sufficient to derive a general solution for the evolution of the scalar field or its equation of state .",
    "however , certain fairly general classes of such models can be solved exactly .",
    "the simplest such models , explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , assume a scalar field initially at rest in a potential satisfying the  slow - roll \" conditions : [ sr1]@xmath11 ^ 21 , + [ sr2]||1 .",
    "the first condition insures that @xmath4 is close to @xmath7 , while the two conditions taken together indicate that @xmath12 is nearly constant . in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite , these are  thawing \" models .",
    "for all potentials satisfying these conditions , it was shown in @xcite that the behavior of @xmath4 can be accurately described by a unique expression depending only on the present - day values of @xmath13 and the initial value of @xmath4 . in @xcite",
    "this result was extended to phantom models satisfying eqs .",
    "( [ sr1]-[sr2 ] ) , and the @xmath4 dependence of these phantom models was shown to be described by the same expression as in the quintessence case .",
    "the slow roll conditions , eqs .",
    "( [ sr1]-[sr2 ] ) , while sufficient to ensure @xmath14 today , are not necessary . in @xcite ,",
    "a second possibility was considered , in which equation ( [ sr1 ] ) holds , but equation ( [ sr2 ] ) is relaxed .",
    "this corresponds to a quintessence field rolling near a local maximum of its potential . as in the case of slow - roll quintessence",
    ", this case can be solved analytically . in this case , there is an extra degree of freedom , the value of @xmath3 , so that instead of a single solution for the evolution of @xmath4 , one obtains a family of solutions that depend on the present - day values of @xmath13 and @xmath4 and the value of @xmath3 at the maximum of the potential .",
    "this family of solutions includes the slow - roll solution as a special case in the limit where @xmath15 .    here",
    "we complete this series of studies by extending the above result to phantom dark energy models .",
    "since phantom fields roll up their potentials , the analogous situation is a phantom rolling close to a local minimum in its potential .",
    "we find that a unique family of solutions , very similar to the one derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be used to approximate the behavior of @xmath4 in these models .",
    "in this section we derive a general expression for the evolution of @xmath4 for a phantom field near its minimum .",
    "our treatment is similar to @xcite . first consider a minimally coupled phantom field @xmath0 in a potential @xmath1 .",
    "the phantom field has a negative kinetic term in its lagrangian , leading to an equation of motion [ kg ] + 3h-=0 , where @xmath16 is the scale factor and @xmath17 is the expansion rate .",
    "dots denote derivatives with respect to time and primes denote derivatives with respect to the field @xmath0 . in a flat universe , the expansion rate is linked to the total density @xmath18 via the friedman equation ( in units where @xmath19 ) as h^2=_t/3 .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor is given by : = -@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the total pressure    using the transformation ( t)=u(t)/a(t)^3/2 , eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) becomes [ kgnew ] + p_tu - a^3/2v@xmath22=0 .",
    "now consider a universe consisting of pressureless matter and a phantom field , where the phantom plays the role of the dark energy . in order to realistically mimic the observed dark energy ,",
    "the phantom must have @xmath4 close to @xmath7 and its energy density must be roughly constant .",
    "the total pressure @xmath21 is then simply given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the present day density of the dark energy .",
    "( in what follows , a subscript @xmath25 always indicates a present day value ) . under this approximation , eq .",
    "( [ kgnew ] ) becomes : [ kgu ] -_0u - a^3/2v@xmath22=0 .",
    "we now apply eq .",
    "( [ kgu ] ) to a phantom rolling near a local minimum @xmath26 in its potential . for any @xmath0 close to the minimum",
    ", the potential can be expanded in a taylor series : v@xmath0=v@xmath26+@xmath27v@xmath26@xmath28 ^ 2+o@xmath29 ^ 3 ) . substituting the above expansion into eq .",
    "( [ kgu ] ) , and taking @xmath30 we obtain [ unew ] -@xmath31u=0 . with the definition [ k ]",
    "k , we obtain the general solution to eq .",
    "( [ unew ] ) to be u = a@xmath32+b@xmath32 .",
    "the requirement of @xmath33 implies that the potential term dominates the kinetic term in the phantom s energy density .",
    "in such a scenario the evolution of the scale factor can be well - approximated by @xmath10cdm ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    [ lcdm a ]",

    "the eos parameter @xmath4 for a phantom is given by [ wshort ] 1+w=- .",
    "our requirement that @xmath47 implies that @xmath48 .",
    "this , together with eq .",
    "( [ phishort ] ) and eq .",

    "( [ lcdm a ] ) : @xmath52 and @xmath53    for convenience , we now switch to the constant @xmath54 . in terms of the phantom potential ,",
    "@xmath55 can be written as    @xmath56    indicating that @xmath55 ( which is always @xmath57 since @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) depends only on the value of the potential and its second derivative at its minimum . in terms of @xmath55",

    "i.e. , which satisfy both slow - roll conditions , a similar analysis was shown to yield only a single form of @xmath6 ( eqn .  ( 18 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "( [ finalfinal ] ) captures the more complex behavior introduced by the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath55 .",

    "( [ finalfinal ] ) has an identical functional form to the corresponding expression for @xmath6 for quintessence models derived in ref .",
    "the only difference for the phantom models is that @xmath67 , producing a corresponding @xmath68 .",

    "further , there is a sign difference between the definition of @xmath55 for phantom models",
    ". [ kdef ] ) and for quintessence models @xcite , corresponding to the fact that here we are dealing with a minimum in the potenial , rather than a maximum .",
    "interestingly , eq .  ( [ finalfinal ] ) reduces to simple polynomial forms if @xmath55 is a small integer .",
    "some of these forms are given in @xcite .",
    "while it would require fine tuning of the potential for @xmath55 to be equal to a small integer , these forms are still useful in obtaining qualitative insight into the behavior of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "we now turn to comparing our analytic expression for the evolution of @xmath4 to the numerically computed exact evolution for a few different models . in each case",
    "we have a perfect fluid dark matter and a phantom field @xmath0 dynamical dark energy .",

    "we note that the accuracy is larger for the quadratic potential than it is for the other two potentials .",
    "this is expected , since the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ finalfinal ] ) was based on the quadratic potential .",
    "this is however not the case for hilltop quintessence @xcite , where in spite of a similar derivation , the highest accuracy was for the pngb potential .",

    "clearly , these models are not ruled out by current supernova data . as in the case of hilltop quintessence @xcite , we find that a larger @xmath55 increases the size of the allowed region .",
    "( [ finalfinal ] ) therefore allows one to map the @xmath6 behavior of a wide range of phantom dark energy models on to a common model - independent evolution .",
    "clearly , this result is not well described by popular linear ( cpl ) parameterization of @xmath4 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath94 , except in the special case of @xmath95 . however , since our treatment demonstrates that the evolution of @xmath4 is completely generic to any model satisfying eq .",

    "( [ finalfinal ] ) allows for an excellent parameterization of these models in terms of @xmath37 , @xmath49 and @xmath55 .",
    "such a parameterization is particularly interesting in the light of recent work implying that the cpl parameterization does not satisfactorily fit the sn+bao+cmb data simultaneously at both low and high redshifts @xcite .",
    "subsequent investigations have shown that eq .",
    "( [ finalfinal ] ) has a much wider applicability than the models described in this work and @xcite .",

    "it was shown that eq .",
    "( [ finalfinal ] ) is not limited to models evolving near extrema of their potentials and can be applied to a broader class of slow - roll quintessence models .",
    "@xcite showed that eq .",
    "( [ finalfinal ] ) also applies to some slow - roll k - essence models .",
    "using techniques previously applied to quintessence , we have derived a general expression for the evolution of @xmath4 , which is valid for a wide class of phantom dark energy models in which is the field is rolling close to a local minimum .",
    "such models provide a mechanism to produce a value of @xmath4 that is slightly less than @xmath7 .",
    "we have tested our expression against the ( numerically determined ) exact evolution for three different models and in each case it replicated the exact evolution studied with an accuracy greater than @xmath96 .",
