    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are thought to harbor supermassive ( up to @xmath1 ) black holes .",
    "accretion onto these black holes is responsible for the extreme luminosity of agns over the whole electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "part of the infalling matter may be transformed into jets ejected with relativistic speeds .",
    "the radio emission in radio - loud agns originates from these jets via synchrotron process .",
    "if a jet points close to the line of sight toward the observer , its brightness is significantly enhanced . for a review of the unified model of agns see urry & padovani ( 1995 ) . a particular class of agns",
    "are blazars .",
    "they show large variations in brightness from the radio to the gamma - ray regime .",
    "they have no emission lines characteristic to other agns in the optical spectrum . according to the physical models of agn ( urry & padovani 1995 ) , we see at these objects almost exactly in the direction of the jet .",
    "j1430 + 4204 ( b1428 + 4217 ) is a blazar with a flat radio spectrum at an extremely high redshift , @xmath0 ( hook & mcmahon 1998 ) .",
    "radio flux density monitoring at 15  ghz revealed a significant brightening of j1430 + 4204 , starting in 2004 and reaching its peak in 2006 ( worsley et al .",
    "the object increased its flux density by a factor of 3 in about 4 months ( in the source rest frame ) .",
    "the radio structure of j1430 + 4204 at the milli - arcsecond ( mas ) scale is predominantly compact as revealed by very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) imaging observations ( e.g. paragi et al .",
    "1994 , helmboldt et al .",
    "a weak extension to the bright compact core is also seen in the w - sw direction .",
    "total flux density outbursts are usually followed by an emergence of a new jet component in the vlbi images of radio agns . by observing j1430",
    "+ 4204 after the brightening , we aimed at detecting a new component in a hope to have a zero - epoch point for a later measurement of its apparent proper motion .",
    "a study of jet kinematics at such a high redshift would have been interesting since the best - observed sample in the 15-ghz mojave survey ( lister et al .",
    "2007 ) is restricted to @xmath2 .",
    "we observed j1430 + 4204 for 8 hours at 15  ghz with the ten 25-m diameter radio telescopes of the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) on 15 sep 2006 .",
    "we also found a similar full - polarization experiment ( code by019 ) in the nrao data archive .",
    "these observations were done on 23 feb 2005 , prior to the brightness peak .",
    "we performed standard vlbi calibration , imaging and model - fitting procedures for both data sets using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and the caltech difmap program .",
    "our total intensity images are displayed in fig .",
    "[ images ] .",
    "the fractional linear polarization of the vlbi core was @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the first and second epoch , respectively .    the source total flux density at 15  ghz was monitored at the ryle telescope ( fabian et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] .",
    "we used three methods for computing the following parameters of j1430 + 4204 : the apparent speed of a possible blob in the jet , @xmath5 ; the doppler factor , @xmath6 ; and the lorentz factor , @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the bulk speed of the material in the jet , expressed in the units of the speed of light @xmath9 . for the jet angle to the line of sight , @xmath10",
    ", we assumed @xmath11 as found from bulk comptonization modeling of the observed x - ray spectrum of j1430 + 4204 ( cellotti et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the most important physical parameter characterizing the jet flow is the bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we are also interested in the apparent tangential velocity of the putative blob in the jet which we translate into proper motion .",
    "the distance scale at this redshift is @xmath13 pc / mas ( assuming a cosmological model with @xmath14  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "we fitted an exponential function to the brightest flare in the flux density curve ( fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] ) and determined the variability brightness temperature ( hovatta et al .",
    "furthermore , we took the intrinsic brightness temperature as @xmath18  k , which assumes equipartition between the particles and the magnetic field in the radio - emitting region ( readhead 1994 ) .",
    "we then calculated the so - called variability lorentz factor and the apparent speed .",
    "we obtained @xmath19  mjy for the flare amplitude and @xmath20 for the rise time .",
    "these led to the variability brightness temperature @xmath21  k , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the apparent proper motion of the jet component is @xmath25  mas / year .",
    "this means that during the time between the two vlba observations ( @xmath26 ) the supposed blob had moved by @xmath27 mas .",
    "this angular displacement is below the limit which we can possibly detect with the vlba at this wavelength ( @xmath28 mas ) .",
    "we fitted circular gaussian brightness distribution models to the vlbi visibility data at @xmath29  ghz at both epochs .",
    "this gave us @xmath30  k brightness temperatures .",
    "it corresponds to a lorentz factor of @xmath31 , if we again assume the equipartition value for the intrinsic brightness temperature @xmath32 .",
    "this method also predicts a proper motion of @xmath25 mas / year .      by assuming that the observed x - ray flux of an agn is of the inverse compton origin , we can estimate the doppler factor ( guijosa & daly 1994 ) . for j1430 + 4204",
    ", we took the x - ray data from celotti et al .",
    "the formula for the doppler factor is @xmath33^{1/(4 + 2\\alpha)}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the radio flux density , @xmath36 is the synchrotron high - frequency cutoff assumed to be @xmath37  ghz .",
    "the observed frequency of the radio peak is @xmath38  ghz , the x - ray flux density is @xmath39  jy taken at @xmath40  kev , @xmath41 is the optically thin spectral index where the @xmath42 convention is used , and @xmath43 is the angular diameter of the source in mas .",
    "this third method also provided @xmath44 mas / year for the jet component proper motion .",
    "the high - redshift blazar j1430 + 4204 produced an exceptional radio flux density outburst in 2006 ( fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] ) .",
    "we imaged the source with the vlba at 15  ghz after the time of the flux density peak , and also analyzed the archive vlba data taken during the rise of the total flux density curve . at both epochs ,",
    "the mas - scale radio structure of the source was similar : a compact core and a weak extension to s - sw ( fig .",
    "[ images ] ) . the core could be fitted with circular gaussian components with sizes of 0.076  mas and 0.060  mas ( full width at half maximum ) on 23 feb 2005 and 15 sep 2006 , respectively .",
    "the comparison of the total and vlbi flux densities at the first epoch ( fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] ) suggests that @xmath45  mjy could be attributed to the radio emission extending to more than a few mas .",
    "based on our vlba imaging , we do not detect any new separate jet component to be associated with the outburst . assuming a small jet angle to the line of sight , we used three different methods to calculate the expected proper motion of such a component .",
    "these gave consistently small values of the proper motion .",
    "we conclude that our time base and angular resolution were insufficient to distinguish any new blob in the jet .",
    "our estimates for the bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath46 ) are comparable with the typical values found for other blazars ( e.g. hovatta et al .",
