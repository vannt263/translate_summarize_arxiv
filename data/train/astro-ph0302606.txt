    "stars form alone and in groups , associations , and clusters ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) . yet",
    "the origin of this diversity in the process of star formation remains poorly understood .",
    "recent work suggests that stars form by gravitational collapse of shock - compressed density fluctuations generated by the supersonic turbulence generally observed in molecular clouds ( e.g. @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "if so , then star formation is controlled by turbulent fragmentation and dynamical collapse of individual , jeans - unstable , protostellar clumps .",
    "fragmentation of gas clouds has been studied for more than a century , yet the process remains poorly understood .",
    "there have been analytical models @xcite , and numerical investigations of the effects of various physical processes on the collapse , such as geometry and rotation of the clouds ( see @xcite for a review ) , and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "recently , the effects of turbulence have been studied extensively in a series of three - dimensional simulations using both grid - based , eulerian and particle - based , lagrangian hydrodynamics ( @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iii ) ; and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iv ) ) .",
    "these papers show that turbulence strongly influences the fragmentation of molecular clouds .",
    "fast , clustered collapse and star formation occurs in regions with turbulence insufficient to support against gravitational collapse , while slow , scattered star formation results from strong turbulent support . however , these results are based on isothermal models with polytropic exponent @xmath7 only .",
    "the role of the equation of state ( eos ) , which is essential in understanding the physical structure and stability of the turbulent clouds , remained unexplored .    the balance of heating and cooling in a molecular cloud can be approximately described by a polytropic eos @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant , and @xmath10 and @xmath0 are thermal pressure , gas density and polytropic exponent , respectively .",
    "the density structure generated by supersonic motions in highly compressible turbulence depends on the eos .",
    "the stiffness of the eos can largely control the density probability distribution function ( pdf ) in strongly compressible turbulence @xcite .",
    "in particular , one - dimensional simulations by @xcite show the shape of the density pdf varying with @xmath0 .",
    "they found that the pdf is log - normal when @xmath11 ( isothermal ) , and develops a power - law tail for @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite showed that radiatively cooling gas can be described by a piecewise polytropic eos , in which the polytropic exponent @xmath0 changes with gas density @xmath13 .",
    "they conducted a detailed analysis including chemistry , thermal balance and radiative transfer , and found that in the interstellar medium the effective polytropic exponent @xmath0 has a range of @xmath1 .",
    "they further predicted that the initial mass function ( imf ) of protostellar cores would vary with @xmath0 , yielding a peaked imf for @xmath14 and a power - law function for @xmath15 .    in this paper , we perform three - dimensional simulations of self - gravitating , supersonic turbulence over the range of @xmath0 identified by @xcite to investigate the effect of varying the eos on the dynamical evolution and fragmentation behavior of turbulent clouds and the subsequent formation of protostellar clusters .",
    "to quantify the dependency on @xmath0 , we consider a true polytropic eos , with @xmath0 being strictly constant in each simulation regardless of the density , rather than the piecewise polytrope used by @xcite and earlier workers .    in  [ sec_com ] we describe our computational methods ; in  [ sec_result ] we give results on fragmentation , the resulting mass distribution of protostellar cores , and the gas density pdf ; and in  [ sec_discussion ] we conclude and speculate about the implications or our work for the formation of star clusters and primordial star formation .",
    "in analytical work on the stability of a self - gravitating , isothermal medium , @xcite derived a relation between the oscillation frequency @xmath16 and the wavenumber @xmath17 of small perturbations , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath20 the gravitational constant , and @xmath13 is the gas density .",
    "the medium is unstable to fragmentation at all wavelengths greater than a critical length @xmath21 , or equivalently all masses exceeding the jeans mass , @xmath22 will collapse under their own weight .",
    "note that we use a cubic definition of @xmath23 .    in a polytropic cloud with eos given by equation  [ eq_eos ] ,",
    "the sound speed is @xmath24 so the jeans mass will be given as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath13 , @xmath25 the specific internal energy is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the adiabatic index , with @xmath28 for ideal gas . for isothermal gas , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we carry out simulations to determine when and how fragmentation occurs .",
    "we use a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code @xcite in order to resolve several orders of magnitude in density during the collapse of shock - compressed regions .",
    "our version of the code includes periodic boundary conditions @xcite and can replace high - density cores with sink particles @xcite .",
    "sink particles accrete surrounding gas particles while conserving mass and momentum , but they only interact gravitationally .",
    "they prevent time step from becoming prohibitively short in very dense regions .",
    "this allows us to follow the dynamical evolution of the system over many free - fall times .",
    "we set up a periodic cube with side length @xmath31 and total mass of unity such that initial density @xmath32 , and sound speed @xmath33 .",
    "the treatment of the polytropic eos follows @xcite , where we set @xmath34 .",
    "we choose values consistent with the sound speed of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for the gas constant , mean molecular weight , and initial temperature of the cloud .",
    "uniform turbulence is driven with the method described by @xcite and @xcite , adding energy over a small range of wavenumbers @xmath17 . driving in two wavenumber ranges",
    "is considered here , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , corresponding to models @xmath40 and @xmath41 in paper ii . in each case , the driving strength is chosen to ensure the same rms velocity despite the different driving wavenumbers , so that the average turbulent jeans mass @xmath42 and jeans number @xmath43 , are the same . in a self - gravitating medium , the maximum resolvable density is determined by the requirement that the local thermal jeans mass be resolved by the sph kernel @xcite ; our models all have the same resolution limit .",
    "the models presented here are computed in normalized units . if scaled to mean densities of @xmath44@xmath45 , and a temperature of @xmath46k ( i.e.  an isothermal sound speed @xmath47km@xmath48s@xmath49 ) , values appropriate for a dark cloud like taurus @xcite , then our simulation cube holds a mass of @xmath50m@xmath51 and has a size of @xmath52pc . for details on the scaling relations ,",
    "see paper ii .",
    "we computed models with @xmath53 , covering the range suggested for interstellar gas by @xcite .",
    "we vary @xmath0 in steps of 0.1 in otherwise identical simulations for both driving wavenumbers .",
    "each simulation starts with a uniform density @xmath32 .",
    "driving begins immediately , while self - gravity is turned on at t=2.0 , after the turbulence is fully established ( see paper ii ) .",
    "our models use @xmath54 particles .",
    "twenty - six simulations were performed simultaneously using a serial version of the code on single 1 ghz pentium iii processors of the parallel computing facility of the american museum of natural history ( amnh ) .",
    "each computation took about 6 months .",
    "figure  [ fig_sinkdis1 ] and figure  [ fig_sinkdis2 ] show the density distribution of the gas . to make the figures ,",
    "a 256@xmath55 grid was filled with densities properly computed from the sph kernel , and the result is displayed in three - dimensional projection ( _ top row _ ) and in a slice through maximum density one free - fall time after self - gravity is turned on for selected @xmath0 and both driving wavenumbers .",
    "as found in previous studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the driving wavenumber strongly influences the density distribution .",
    "driving with @xmath562 produces strong filamentary structure , while the density distribution for @xmath578 remains more uniform at large scale .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath0 is as important as the driving in determining collapse behavior .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , the number of collapsed cores replaced by sink particles decreases , and the cores cluster less .",
    "for the same @xmath0 , driving with @xmath562 produces both far more , and more clustered dense cores than driving with @xmath578 .",
    "the dense cores tend to collapse predominantly in filaments or at intersections of filaments . at @xmath58 ,",
    "no fragmentation occurs by the time shown for driving with @xmath578 .",
    "the isothermal case , @xmath59 , agrees well with previous results in papers  ii and  iii .",
    "our current investigation agrees with the results in paper i  iii , that collapse tends to form clusters with high efficiency in regions with weak turbulence , while in regions with strong turbulence , sparse , slow collapse occurs .",
    "we now add the additional criterion that collapse and fragmentation depends strongly on @xmath0 .    in regions with @xmath15 ,",
    "fragmentation occurs earlier and more frequently , while in regions where @xmath14 , fragmentation is retarded and less frequent .    figure [ fig_sinknum ] compares the number of collapsed cores at different @xmath0 for models with different driving wavenumbers .",
    "the rate at which new protostellar cores form differs for different @xmath0 .",
    "models with low @xmath0 form cores quickly , while models with large @xmath0 form new cores more rarely .",
    "again we see more cores for driving with @xmath562 than for @xmath578 .",
    "@xcite found an empirical scaling relation @xmath60 of the critical jeans number @xmath61 for collapse for elongated clouds .",
    "the jeans number should be related to the number of fragments . however , with higher resolution and more statistics for a wide range of @xmath0 in our simulations , we find something more like the inverse , but strongly dependent on the details of the driving .",
    "fig [ fig_sinkgamma ] shows the relation between the value of @xmath0 and the number of fragments at one free - fall time .",
    "the number of fragments drops quickly as @xmath0 increases for driving with @xmath562 , and more slowly for driving with @xmath578 , which produces fewer fragments to begin with .",
    "figure [ fig_sinkacc ] shows the accretion histories ( the time evolution of the combined mass fraction of all protostellar cores ) for all the individual @xmath0 cases and for both driving wavelengths .",
    "note that much less mass is accreted when driving with @xmath578 .",
    "we focus on the @xmath562 model .",
    "the lower @xmath0 is , the earlier fragmentation occurs and the larger the number of fragments that form .",
    "it also takes longer for the clouds with high @xmath0 to fragment .",
    "the slope of the accretion curves are roughly the same , but the number of sinks is very different for different @xmath0 at the same time , which suggests that the average core mass is different for different @xmath0 .",
    "a low-@xmath0 environment produces a large number of collapsed cores of relatively low mass , while @xmath14 results in the formation of considerably fewer , but more massive , cores . since the overall mass growth rate of collapsing cores",
    "is closely related to the expected star formation rate , our result suggests that the overall star formation rate is higher in low-@xmath0 clouds than in high-@xmath0 clouds .",
    "it remains unclear what the final amount of mass in stars will be , as higher mass stars may drive surrounding gas away more quickly ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we do not find any signs of collapse in the model with @xmath62 even after several free - fall times .",
    "this can be explained with a jeans mass analysis giving the critical condition for gravitational collapse . from equation  [ [ eq_jeans3 ] ] , we have @xmath63 this implies that for @xmath64 the jeans mass @xmath23 decreases as density increases during collapse ; for @xmath65 , @xmath23 remains constant ; while if @xmath66 , then @xmath23 _ increases _ with density .",
    "thus , any collapse will choke itself off when @xmath67 , as found in our numerical results .",
    "fragmentation is a complex process depending on the local conditions in the cloud , so the above analysis for an isolated spherical perturbation is an approximation .",
    "indeed , fragmentation already ceases for @xmath68 in the model driven with @xmath69 , suggesting the importance of the details of the turbulence in determining collapse behavior .",
    "observations suggest that the mass distribution of gas clumps in molecular clouds follows a power law , @xmath70 , with typical values of the exponent being @xmath71 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite derived a power law for the high mass stellar imf in the same notation with @xmath72 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we measure clump - mass spectra in our models using a clump - finding algorithm similar to the one described by @xcite but working on all three spatial coordinates and adapted to make use of the sph kernel smoothing procedure ( for details see appendix a in paper i ) .",
    "figure [ fig_mas ] shows the spectra of gas clumps and collapsed cores for models with different values of @xmath0 , driven with @xmath562 .",
    "three different evolutionary phases are shown : after turbulence has been fully established , but before self - gravity has been turned on , at @xmath73 ; and when the fraction of mass accumulated in collapsed cores ( sink particles ) has reached @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the mass distribution of both clumps and collapsed cores changes with @xmath0 , with the effect being most pronounced for the cores . in low-@xmath0 models , the core mass spectrum at the high - mass end is roughly log - normal .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , fewer but more massive cores emerge . when @xmath76 , the distribution is dominated by a few high mass cores , and the spectrum tends to flatten out .",
    "it is no longer fit by either a log - normal or a power - law .",
    "the clump mass spectra , on the other hand , do show power - law behavior on the high mass side , even for @xmath76 .",
    "our results suggest that massive stars can form in small groups or even in isolation in gas with @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite suggested that a stiff eos with @xmath76 should lead to a peaked imf , biased toward massive stars , while an eos with @xmath77 results in a power - law imf , in general agreement with our simulations .",
    "figure [ fig_pdf_int ] shows mass and volume weighted pdfs of gas density @xmath78 and @xmath79 before self - gravity has been turned on for selected values of @xmath0 and both driving wavenumbers .",
    "we also show gaussian fits to the pdfs together with their error @xmath80 , summed over all points above @xmath81 of the peak values .",
    "the mass - weighted density pdf @xmath82 is calculated directly from the local density associated with each sph particle , as described by @xcite .",
    "the volume - weighted density pdf @xmath83 is calculated on a cubic grid derived from the sph density field by taking a cube of @xmath84 cells and using the sph kernel smoothing procedure to find the density at the center of each cell .",
    "both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are normalized so that @xmath85 .",
    "the density behind shocks in supersonic turbulence depends on the compressibility of the gas , @xmath86 so turbulent density fluctuations should increase as @xmath0 decreases .",
    "indeed , we see that in figure [ fig_pdf_int ] , the width of @xmath78 and @xmath79 increases as @xmath0 decreases .    in models driven with wavenumber @xmath87 , there are super - gaussian tails in the low - density end in the volume - weighted pdfs for all @xmath0 and in the mass - weighted pdf for @xmath88 .",
    "one - dimensional simulations by @xcite showed that the volume - weighted density pdf of supersonic turbulent gas displays a power - law tail at high densities for @xmath89 , becomes log - normal for @xmath11 ( isothermal ) , and develops a power - law tail at low density for @xmath14 , which is only in partial agreement with our results .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to the low resolution in low - density regions in our simulations , the difference between one- and three - dimensional simulations , or different driving .",
    "a full investigation of the density pdfs under various conditions , with different codes , different dimensions ( three - dimensional vs.one-dimensional ) , different resolution , different turbulence driving , different initial mach number , and with and without magnetic field is beyond the scope of this paper ; these issues will be addressed elsewhere .      in order to compare the mass and volume weighted pdfs",
    ", we will find it useful to define @xmath90 ; the mass and volume weighted pdfs of @xmath91 are then @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively",
    ". we can relate @xmath94 to @xmath95 if we remember that for any montonic function @xmath96 , it can be shown that the pdf @xmath97 and @xmath98    since @xmath99 , and @xmath100 @xcite , it follows that @xmath101 then we can relate @xmath92 to @xmath93 @xmath102 where c is a normalization constant .",
    "if @xmath93 follows a normal distribution , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the average ( in volume ) value of @xmath91 , and @xmath105 is the dispersion , then @xmath106 ^ 2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] since @xmath107 , the normalization @xmath108 equation  [ eq_pm_0 ] can thus be rewritten as : @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "this is also a normal distribution , with the same dispersion @xmath105 as that of @xmath79 but shifted average value @xmath111 .",
    "using the volume pdf normalization @xmath112 , it can be seen @xmath113 as noted , for example , by @xcite .",
    "this holds only if the density pdf is log - normal .",
    "( note that in this case @xmath114 . )",
    "this derivation gives several properties of the density pdfs @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if one of them is log - normal , so is the other ; and if they are log - normal , the width @xmath105 of both profiles should be equal ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq_pv ] ] and  [ [ eq_pm ] ] ) , and the peaks of the pdfs @xmath92 and @xmath93 should lie symmetrically around zero ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq_sm_sv ] ] ) .    in figure [ fig_pdf_int ]",
    "the volume - weighted pdfs lie to the left of the mass - weighted pdfs , with @xmath115 , as predicted .",
    "the decent gaussian fits to the peaks of the pdfs show that the assumption of log - normal behavior is not bad .",
    "three - dimensional grid - based simulations of decaying turbulence by @xcite show similar gaussian pdfs .",
    "a detailed examination of the moments of the density pdfs , shown in fig [ fig_mom_k1278 ] , shows that these pdfs are , in fact , not perfect log - normals .",
    "the first moment ( mean ) shows that @xmath78 and @xmath79 of models with both driving wavenumbers @xmath116 and @xmath87 are not exactly symmetrically distributed .",
    "this could be due to turbulent intermittency in our small boxes producing deviations from a purely gaussian distribution .",
    "the gaussian behavior expected from a well sampled distribution is more visible in models driven with @xmath87 compared to @xmath116 . in fact , @xmath78 and @xmath79 of @xmath87 are more equal in width , as seen from the second moment ( variance ) .",
    "this is a sign of better sampling  more modes contribute to the overall velocity field , thus the central limit theorem is more appropriately applied to the @xmath87 than to the @xmath116 case @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_pdf_3phases ] shows the evolution of the mass - weighted gas density pdf @xmath78 of the model driven with @xmath116 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the same three evolutionary phases as defined in  [ subsec_mas ] are shown : the initial distribution , and times at which dense cores have accreted @xmath74 and @xmath117 of the mass .",
    "these pdfs do not include gas accreted into the cores .",
    "we again show the best - fit gaussian for the part of each pdf above 10% of peak .    during the dynamical evolution ,",
    "the pdfs in the non - isothermal cases develop pronounced positive deviations from the the gaussian fit , while the pdf in the isothermal case remains well fit by a gaussian ( of increasing width ) , consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "the high - density tails gradually diminish as @xmath0 increases from 0.2 to 1.0 , vanishing almost entirely at @xmath118 . at @xmath76 ,",
    "though , the tails develop again and get stronger as @xmath0 continues to increase .",
    "we do not fully understand why the tails only appear in non - isothermal cases .",
    "the first four moments of the density pdfs for each of the three evolutionary phases discussed previously are shown in figure  [ fig_mom ] .",
    "we can see that the moments vary as collapse proceeds , demonstrating that self - gravity plays an important role in shaping the density pdf .",
    "the plot of the skewness shows that the pdfs of turbulence without self - gravity are always skewed to low densities , regardless of @xmath0 .",
    "shock compression comes at a cost : the gas swept up in shock fronts has to come from somewhere , and those regions now contain only low - density gas .",
    "as the filling factor of shocks is low @xcite most of the volume is occupied by these low - density regions resulting in pdfs with negative skewness .",
    "the situation changes , however , when self - gravity comes into play .",
    "gravitational contraction produces high densities in addition to the turbulent shock compression , the pdf s in the later stages of evolution are thus strongly biased towards high - density gas and the skewness becomes positive .",
    "we have investigated the effect of varying the equation of state ( eos ) on the formation of stellar clusters in turbulent molecular clouds using a set of three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "our results show that the eos plays an important role in the fragmentation of the clouds , the determination of the initial mass function ( imf ) of the protostellar cores , and the shape of the gas density pdfs .",
    "the ability of interstellar gas clouds to fragment under the action of self - gravity _ decreases _ with _ increasing _ polytropic exponent @xmath0 in the range @xmath1 relevant for galactic molecular clouds .",
    "the total amount of mass in collapsed cores , however , appears to remain roughly constant through that range .",
    "at least half of this material is expected to accrete onto the protostellar system at the center of each collapsing core ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "small values of @xmath0 thus lead to the formation of dense clusters of predominantly low - mass stars , while @xmath2 results in the formation of isolated and massive stars .",
    "fragmentation and collapse ceases entirely for @xmath3 as expected from analytic arguments .",
    "the mass spectra of both clumps and collapsed cores change with @xmath0 , with that effect being most pronounced for the cores . for @xmath119 , their mass spectrum appears roughly log - normal . as @xmath0 increases , fewer but more massive objects emerge .",
    "when @xmath76 , the distribution is dominated by high mass objects only , and the spectrum tends to flatten out .",
    "it is fit by neither a log - normal nor a power - law .",
    "the clump mass spectra , on the other hand , do show power - law behavior at the high mass end for all @xmath0 .    the density pdf changes with @xmath0 as well .",
    "the width of the profile decreases as @xmath0 increases , as expected from analytic arguments about shock compression .",
    "both mass- and volume - weighted pdfs show imperfect log - normal distributions .",
    "self - gravity helps shape the pdf . during dynamical collapse , the pdf develops a high - density tail , which is the imprint of local collapse of high density regions .    in a polytropic gas cloud , any temperature fluctuation corresponds to a density fluctuation , @xmath120 .",
    "we note that from the gas density pdfs in figure [ fig_pdf_int ] , the maximum width of the profiles is about 12 , which corresponds to @xmath121 .",
    "so for the extreme case @xmath122 , @xmath123 . for a cloud with an average temperature of about 10 k the maximum temperature of the low - density gas therefore could reach values up to @xmath124 k , if @xmath0 is extremely low .",
    "this still falls in the temperature range observed in star forming regions .",
    "the principal motivation of this paper is to investigate how the fragmentation behavior of a turbulent cloud and the subsequent formation of stars are affected by physical state of the cloud , as described by the eos . since @xmath0 reflects the balance between heating and cooling ,",
    "@xmath0 is expected bo be low in regions of strong cooling , while @xmath0 may be large where the cooling mechanism is insufficient @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the true chemical state and composition of interstellar gas is difficult to assess , so exact values of @xmath0 are difficult to estimate observationally .    the possibility that isolated , massive stars form when @xmath14 is of interest , not only because ionizing radiation , stellar winds , and supernovae from massive stars play an important role in the interstellar medium , but also because massive stars are rarely observed in isolation .",
    "rather , they are usually found as members of rich stellar clusters .",
    "recently , however , @xcite has reported observations of massive stars found in isolation or associated only with very small groups of lower - mass stars in the bulge of m51 .",
    "@xcite also reported finding apparently isolated , massive , field stars in both the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "our simulations suggest that molecular cloud regions forming isolated , high - mass stars have @xmath14 . in this case",
    "turbulent cloud fragmentation tends to produce isolated , massive collapsing cores that will feed onto isolated high - mass stars .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that high - mass stars can form in collapsing gas clumps via disk accretion very much the same way as low mass stars are believed to do .",
    "there is thus no need for a dense cluster environment where high - mass stars could build up by collisions of lower - mass stars ( as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "a theory of galactic - scale star formation partially based on the universality of log - normal density pdfs has been proposed by elmegreen ( 2002 ) .",
    "our results do show a log - normal form at least for the peak of the pdfs , containing most of the gas .",
    "however , the dispersion of the pdf varies substantially as the eos changes ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mom_k1278 ] ) , so that the fraction of gas available for star formation would depend significantly on the eos in such a theory .",
    "this raises the question of how it could still be able to explain a global schmidt law across many different galaxies with different metallicities , radiation fields , interstellar pressures , and so forth .",
    "high resolution simulations by @xcite of the formation of the first star suggest that fragmentation during the collapse of metal - free pregalactic halos is rather inefficient , resulting in the formation of single , massive stars rather than clusters of lower - mass objects . in the absence of metals ,",
    "inefficient cooling may result in high @xmath0 , perhaps helping to explain these results .",
    "we do note , however , that simulations by @xcite show greater multiplicity .",
    "they use similar chemistry , but examine more massive , more isolated halos , with substantially larger limiting mass resolution .",
    "the eos will have less effect on these larger scales , which are more dominated by gravity .",
    "if the metal - free gas indeed shows a high effective @xmath0 , our models would suggest that their collapsing regions will show little further fragmentation if followed down to stellar mass scales .",
