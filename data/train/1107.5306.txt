    "it is worth noting that this value is well within the distribution of molecular gas fractions found by @xcite in a volume - limited sample of _ normal _ etgs in the atlas@xmath74 survey of very nearby etgs .",
    "since star formation is ongoing in these galaxies , we expect the current molecular gas masses calculated above to be lower than the initial molecular gas contents .",
    "given a characteristic exponential time - scale ( @xmath75 ) for the gas depletion ( which is also the star formation time - scale ) , the current molecular gas fraction ( @xmath76 ) is related to the initial value ( @xmath77 ) by @xmath78    where @xmath57 is the look - back time to the onset of star formation ( i.e. the starburst age ) . using equation  ( [ equation : age ] ) to estimate @xmath57 , and adopting a value of 0.1 gyr for the characteristic time - scale of the recent star formation episodes in etgs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimate @xmath77 in each of our d - etgs .",
    "these initial molecular gas fractions are presented in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gf ] .",
    "the estimated initial gas fractions are small , with a median value of around 4 per cent .",
    "recent work ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has suggested that the merger activity ( and associated star formation ) in nearby etgs largely involves minor mergers between dry etgs and gas - rich satellites with mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:10 . if the _",
    "iras_-detected d - etgs indeed formed via this channel , then a typical initial gas fraction of 4 per cent implies that the gas fractions of the accreted satellites are likely to be between @xmath520 and @xmath544 per cent ( assuming that the etgs themselves are gas free ) .",
    "it is worth noting that these empirical results are consistent with recent numerical work which suggests that the satellites fuelling the star formation in nearby etgs should have molecular gas fractions greater than 20 per cent @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the molecular gas analysis is only representative of the 15 per cent of d - etgs that are detected by _",
    "a more robust statistical analysis requires infrared data on the entirety of the d - etg sample studied here .",
    "we have explored the properties of dust and associated molecular gas in etgs , by studying 352 nearby ( @xmath0 ) etgs with prominent dust features in the sdss dr7 .",
    "the galaxies were identified through direct visual inspection of sdss images using the gz2 project .",
    "our analysis has focused on comparing the local environment , star formation and nuclear activity of these d - etgs to those of a control sample drawn from the general etg population .",
    "we have then explored the properties and origin of the dust and associated molecular gas in these systems , and studied the processes that lead to their formation .",
    "two - thirds of the d - etgs show morphological disturbances at the depth of the standard sdss images , suggesting a merger origin for these galaxies .",
    "d - etgs reside preferentially in low - density environments , with 80 per cent inhabiting the field ( compared to 60 per cent of their control - sample counterparts ) and less than 2 per cent inhabiting clusters ( compared to 10 per cent of their control - sample counterparts ) .",
    "d - etgs show bluer uv - optical colours compared to the control etg population , indicating the presence of enhanced levels of star formation activity .",
    "an analysis using optical emission - line ratios indicates that the fraction of objects classified as star forming and composite are , respectively , factors of 3 and 8 higher in the d - etgs compared to their control - sample counterparts .",
    "the fraction of seyferts is more than an order of magnitude higher , while the fraction of galaxies classified as quiescent is correspondingly an order of magnitude smaller in the d - etg population compared to that in the control sample .",
    "the presence of prominent dust features in an etg therefore significantly increases its chances of hosting both star formation and nuclear activity , with nuclear activity being the dominant gas ionization mechanism .",
    "we have explored the dust content of our d - etgs , both in terms of the clumpy dust mass contained in the large - scale dust features ( visible in the optical sdss images ) and in terms of the diffuse dust that may exist in the ism .",
    "the clumpy dust masses span the range @xmath2@xmath3m@xmath4 and are typically several factors higher than the maximum dust contribution expected from stellar mass loss from the old , underlying stellar populations that dominate etgs",
    ". the clumpy dust mass does not correlate with the blue luminosity of the galaxies , indicating that galactic - scale cooling flows are unlikely to be responsible for the dust content .",
    "similarly , no correlation is found between the clumpy dust content and the age of the recent starburst , suggesting that the dust is not produced in situ from the star formation triggered by the merger event , but is rather accreted directly during the merger .",
    "the clumpy dust masses are strictly lower limits to the total dust masses because they do not include diffuse dust which may be intermixed with the stars and is essentially invisible in the optical images . in the 15 per cent of our d - etgs that are detected by _ iras _ , we have estimated the ` total ' ( clumpy + diffuse ) dust mass using the _ iras _ 60- and 100-@xmath62 m fluxes .",
    "the average discrepancy between the clumpy and _ iras_-derived dust mass in these d - etgs is a factor of 4.5 . in other words , only @xmath520 per cent of the dust mass in these objects is contained in the large - scale dust features that are observed in the optical images .",
    "nevertheless , the _ iras _ dust masses show the same lack of correlation with galaxy properties and starburst ages as their clumpy counterparts .",
    "the correspondence between dust and cold gas allows us to explore the properties of the cold gas reservoirs in our d - etgs .",
    "restricting ourselves to the _ iras_-detected galaxies ( in which we have a reasonable estimates of the total dust mass ) , we employ the average molecular g / d of etgs in the literature ( @xmath79 ) to estimate the current molecular gas fractions of these objects .",
    "the median value of the current gas fraction is @xmath5 1.3 per cent .",
    "given the current molecular gas fraction , an estimate of the age of the starburst and a characteristic gas depletion ( star formation ) time - scale , we have estimated the _ initial _ molecular gas fraction in each _",
    "iras_-detected d - etg , with a median value of @xmath54 per cent . given recent work that suggests that the merger activity in nearby etgs largely involves minor mergers with mass ratios between 1:10 and 1:4 ( e.g. *",
    "* ) , a typical initial molecular gas fraction of 4 per cent suggests that the gas - rich satellites accreted by the _",
    "iras_-detected etgs are likely to have had molecular gas fractions between @xmath520 and 44 per cent ( assuming that the etgs themselves are gas and dust free ) .",
    "while recent uv - optical studies have measured the continuous ( minor - merger - driven ) star formation in etgs over the last 8 billion years , less is known about the dust and associated gas that drives this star formation .",
    "this paper has offered insights into the ism of nearby etgs that are merger remnants and , in particular , the initial gas masses plausibly brought in by the satellites that drive the star formation .",
    "the galaxy sample studied here provides an ideal basis for future studies of d - etgs using new instruments such as _ herschel _ and the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) to probe the properties of the ism of nearby etgs and achieve a fuller understanding of the gas that drives the star formation in these galaxies at late epochs .",
