    "<S> we point out that the field dependence of @xmath25 in the ( ii ) and ( iii ) regimes are dominated by the phonon contribution @xmath28 determined by spin - phonon scattering , which contains elastic and inelastic processes . </S>",

    "<S> in this situation , where all spins are fully polarized and the magnetic ( spin - wave ) excitations are gapped with a gap @xmath30 , thermal conductivity is almost entirely dominated by the pure phonon contribution without spin scattering because of the following reasons . </S>",

    "<S> second , inelastic scattering is also absent due to the formation of the large zeeman gap . </S>",

    "<S> the fact that data for both field directions stabilizing different spin configurations ( 3-in-1-out for @xmath34 $ ] and 2-in-2-out for @xmath35 $ ] ) follow the same curve implies that the elastic spin - phonon scattering dominates over the inelastic scattering in this regime . </S>",

    "<S> this low - field behavior of @xmath25 is most likely due to the monopole contribution @xmath42 because of the following reasons . </S>",

    "<S> 3(a ) ( see supplemental material  @xcite for more detail ) , the initial reduction of @xmath25 disappears below @xmath5 , which is consistent with the monopole scenario because ferromagnetic ordering prevents the monopole formation .     determined by fitting @xmath46 , for @xmath26@xmath38 [ 0,0,1 ] and [ 1,1,1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> inset shows @xmath3 plotted as a function of @xmath47 at very low field . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of @xmath25 with @xmath26 implies that the number of monopoles is reduced with @xmath26 at low fields . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction is expected even in the dispersionless classical monopoles with gap @xmath48 ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the classical case , the number of monopoles will decay exponentially with decreasing temperature below @xmath49 . therefore the observed quite substantial reduction of @xmath25 even at low temperatures well below @xmath44 is totally inconsistent with the classical monopoles . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide strong evidence that the monopole excitation gap is dramatically suppressed from the classical monopole , suggesting the emergence of dispersive quantum magnetic monopoles illustrated in figs.1(c ) and ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the substantial reduction of monopole density by the low field will result in a reduction of the inelastic spin - phonon scattering process related to the monopole hopping discussed above , which further emphasizes the significant role of the quantum monopoles themselves as a heat conducting carrier at low fields .    </S>",

    "<S> is determined by the number of low - energy itinerant quasiparticles , this @xmath51 is a measure of the suppression rate of magnetic monopoles at low fields . </S>",

    "<S> as the temperature is lowered , @xmath51 first increases , decreases after showing maximum at @xmath53 - 0.5k and suddenly vanishes at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the magnitude of @xmath51 in the two field directions may be related to the expected difference in the density of 3-in-1-out configuration at high fields , but the trends of @xmath54 are similar in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of @xmath51 with decreasing @xmath18 below @xmath44 can be accounted for by the reduction of thermal smearing of the monopole excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of @xmath51 at lower temperatures is expected when the thermal energy scale @xmath55 becomes comparable to a fraction of the monopole excitation gap ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , possible ferromagnetic fluctuations , because of the weakly first - order nature of the transition at @xmath5 , would also suppress @xmath51 near @xmath5 . in any case , the observed low energy scale of @xmath55 indicates that the excitation gap is strongly reduced than the classical monopole case ( @xmath56k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the present results lead us to conclude that the thermally excited quantum monopoles carry substantial portion of the heat particularly in the regime ( i ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is reinforced by the fact that @xmath17 at zero field shows a distinct decrease below @xmath5 ( fig.2 ) , where the phonon contribution @xmath28 is expected to be enhanced owing to the ferromagnetic spin alignment .    </S>",
    "<S> next we demonstrate that quantum monopoles are highly mobile in the crystal lattice . assuming the kinetic approximation , the monopole contribution to the thermal conductivity @xmath42 is written as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the monopole contribution in the specific heat , @xmath59 is the velocity and @xmath60 is the mean free path of the monopoles . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath60 at 0.6k simply by assuming that the amount of initial reduction of @xmath25 shown red double - headed arrow in the inset of fig.3(b ) is attributed to the monopole contribution . </S>",

    "<S> we stress that this long @xmath60 is still underestimated , since the total specific heat and the initial reduction of thermal conductivity give only an overestimate and underestimate , respectively , for the monopole contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the excitations are mobile to a very long distance , @xmath66 , without being scattered . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that @xmath60 is much longer than the inter - monopole distance , which is estimated to be at most @xmath67 , assuming monopole density of 1% of total number of tetrahedra . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a very large coherent volume including more than @xmath68 tetrahedra , demonstrating highly mobile transport of this long - lived particle , whose effective mass is as heavy as @xmath69 times the bare electron mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this extremely small scattering rate may be due to the quantum feature , which prohibits the simple monopole - antimonopole pair annihilation that violates energy conservation . </S>",
