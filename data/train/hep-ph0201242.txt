    "qcd is a very strange theory . on the one hand , it is formulated in terms of quarks and gluons ; on the other hand , these particles are never observed experimentally . due to confinement , a fundamental but poorly understood property of the theory , only color neutral ( color singlet ) particles are possible as asymptotic states .",
    "thus only hadrons will hit our detectors but not quarks or gluons .",
    "+ another interesting property of qcd is that its lagrangian has an almost perfect @xmath5 chiral symmetry , which is broken only by the very small up and down quark masses .",
    "however this symmetry is not directly observed in the world - it is hidden , _",
    "i.e. _ spontaneously broken .",
    "+ one of the most intriguing fields of study in physics , both experimentally and theoretically , is the exploration of regimes where the color degree of freedom is not trapped into a small volume of hadrons , and where chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "these regimes are expected to be achieved as phases of bulk matter at high temperature or / and at high density .",
    "experimentally it is believed these conditions can be reached in heavy ion collisions . + as has been argued very recently @xcite , however , it is possible that a regime exists where the chiral symmetry is ( almost ) restored but hadrons as entities still exist . to see this regime one needs to only study very highly excited hadrons .",
    "such a task is experimentally feasible with present facilities and with a careful analysis of older data .",
    "evidence of effective chiral restoration might then be seen in the spectroscopic patterns of the highly excited hadrons .",
    "it is amusing to note , that data which hint the onset of this regime have existed for many years , but have not attracted much attention .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to review the recent developments in this field . as will be seen very little can be calculated directly .",
    "however we can reach some definitive conclusions on the asymptotic symmetry properties of spectral functions using only very general theoretical grounds such as the well - established idea of quark - hadron duality , the property of asymptotic freedom and the apparatus of operator product expansion ( ope ) in qcd .",
    "in particular one can show that the effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking must smoothly switch off once we go up in the spectrum .",
    "this then implies that the spectrum of highly excited states should reveal the chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "this will be reflected in multiplet structures for the highly excited states .",
    "there is a caveat which must be made at this point . on theoretical grounds we have no _ a priori _ way to establish whether or not hadron states remain as identifiable resonances when one studies the spectrum high enough for chiral symmetry to be effectively restored .",
    "we conjecture , however , that it is possible , and then ask whether the experimental data support this conjecture .",
    "moreover we have strong theoretical evidence that the conjecture is not impossible : in large @xmath0 qcd the meson spectrum can be shown to behave in precisely this way .",
    "+ the idea that the fundamental strong interaction theory should posses an approximate @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) chiral symmetry dates back to the 1960s @xcite .",
    "one of the most important insights from this was that this symmetry must be spontaneously broken in the vacuum ( i.e. realized in the nambu - goldstone mode ) .",
    "the most important early arguments were : ( i ) the absence of parity doublets in the hadron spectrum ( if the chiral symmetry were realized in the wigner - weil mode_i.e .",
    "_ if the vacuum were trivial ",
    "then the hadron spectrum would have to reveal the multiplets of the chiral group which are manifest as parity doublets ) ; ( ii ) the exceptionally low mass of pions , which are taken to be pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneously broken axial symmetry .",
    "substantial phenomenological work in this field occurred during the 1960s .",
    "however , the microscopic foundations of the symmetry were not well understood .",
    "when qcd appeared in the 1970s , one of the reasons for its rapid acceptance was that it very naturally explained all of the successes of chiral current algebra .",
    "+ in parallel with the development of the current algebra , the physics of excited hadron states also attracted significant attention . one important result for the present context",
    "is that the famous linear - like behavior of regge trajectories required the parity doubling of baryonic states , due to the so called generalized mcdowell symmetry @xcite .",
    "and indeed , the `` regge physicists '' have observed that high in the baryon spectrum there appear more and more parity doublets .",
    "on the other hand , such doublets were clearly absent low in the spectrum , a fact which could not be understood from the regge physics perspective .",
    "+ given these facts , it is difficult to understand why the simple idea that chiral symmetry is effectively restored for states high in the spectrum was not been explored long ago . from the present perspective",
    "there is no contradiction between the linear - like behavior of the highly - lying baryon regge trajectories and the absence of parity doublets low in the spectrum . we know",
    ", that the well established spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry prevents the low - lying states from doubling .",
    "this , together with the mcdowell symmetry suggests then that there should be no systematic linear parallel regge trajectories for positive and negative parity states low in the baryon spectrum .",
    "of course , this is precisely what is seen @xcite .",
    "+ to the best of our knowledge the first speculations that the parity doublets seen in the highly lying baryon states probably reflect the chiral symmetry restoration have appeared only recently @xcite .",
    "this possibility was taken seriously in ref .",
    "it was argued in the latter work that it is quite natural to expect chiral symmetry restoration high in the spectrum because in this case the typical momenta of quarks should be high , and once it is high enough and approach the chiral symmetry restoration scale the dynamical ( constituent ) mass of quarks should drop off and as a consequence the chiral symmetry should be restored .",
    "in other words , at high momenta the valence quarks in hadrons should decouple from the quark condensates .",
    "this smooth chiral symmetry restoration is seen by the presence of approximate parity doublets high in the spectrum .",
    "this perspective , while interesting in its own right , suggests strong limitations on constituent quark models .",
    "thus it becomes evident that the constituent quark model is not applicable high in the spectrum . +",
    "that chiral symmetry must indeed be restored high in the spectrum was shown in ref .",
    "this can be seen directly from quark - hadron duality , asymptotic freedom property of qcd and the ope .",
    "it was shown that even if the chiral symmetry is strongly broken in the vacuum , and hence the low - lying states do not manifest chiral symmetry , one should expect effective chiral symmetry restoration in the spectral density for highly lying states in the spectrum .",
    "this then suggests that the highly excited hadrons should fall into multiplets of nearly degenerate states which are associated with representations of the chiral group .",
    "all such possible multiplets have been classified and it was demonstrated that the existing data on highly lying baryon resonances are appear to be compatible with this .",
    "new experimental studies are needed , however , in order to make any definite statements whether we see approximate chiral symmetry restoration at baryon masses of 2 gev and higher .",
    "if it does take a place , then the spectrum of highly excited baryons should consist exclusively of approximate parity doublets .",
    "+ these ideas have immediately been extended by beane @xcite for highly excited vector and axial vector mesons , which also should be degenerate once the chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "beane has proved that it is impossible in the large @xmath0 limit to satisfy the chiral symmetry of qcd lagrangian and the quark - hadron duality if the highly excited vector and axial vector mesons do not form parity doublets . yet",
    ", there appear to be no experimentally observable parity doublets in this meson case , in contrast to baryons .",
    "+ we should stress that this smooth chiral symmetry restoration should not be confused with a phase transition .",
    "if one defines a phase transition in the usual way as an abrupt transition of the vacuum from one phase to the other , then the phase transition implies symmetry restoration through the whole spectrum of the system , not only for the highly lying states . on the contrary ,",
    "the property which we discuss , is a particular case of a different , but quite general , physical property .",
    "namely , if one studies a system ( in our case the qcd vacuum ) with a high frequency ( or short distance ) probe that is sensitive to distances that are much smaller than the length associated with the symmetry breaking in the system , then the response of the system to this probe is essentially the same as if there were no symmetry breaking in the system .",
    "for example , if one probes a metal in the superconducting phase with photons @xmath7 , then the superconducting coherence in the ground state ( which is analogous with the qcd vacuum for our case ) become unimportant and response of the superconductor is the same as of normal metal .",
    "there is a smooth transition from the regime @xmath8where the effects of the superconducting ( phase coherent ) structure of the metal are crucially important , to the regime @xmath7where they are not .",
    "+ this short review consists of a number of sections . in the second one we give a short overview of chiral symmetry in qcd , which may be omitted by any reader who is familiar with the subject . in the third section we give a simple pedagogical quantum mechanical example . we show that it is a very natural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is important for the low - lying spectrum of the system , can become unimportant for the highly - lying states ; the high lying states reveal a multiplet structure of nearly degenerate states . in the next section",
    "we discuss a tool , the spectral density , which can be used to study systems with continuous spectra . in that section , we show why one should expect the smooth chiral symmetry restoration high in the spectrum .",
    "the fifth section is devoted to somewhat delicate question about to what extent one can use the language of highly excited resonance states once we are in the continuum . in the sixth section",
    "we classify all possible parity - chiral multiplets that should be recovered once we approach the regime of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the experimental data for both low - lying baryon states and the highly lying states are analyzed in the seventh section , where we show that the existing experimental pattern of @xmath1 and @xmath2 excitations is such that it can be interpreted that one achieves the regime of approximate chiral symmetry restoration at baryon masses of 2 gev .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that the new experimental studies are called for to make this conjecture a more definite statement .",
    "finally we present a general outlook in a concluding section .",
    "in the chiral limit the quarks are massless . in reality",
    "the masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks are quite small compared to the typical hadronic scale of 1 gev ; to a good approximation they can be neglected . in this limit",
    "the right and left components of quark fields    @xmath11    are decoupled .",
    "this is because the quark - gluon interaction is vectorial , @xmath12 , which does not mix the right- and left - handed components of quark fields . on the other hand in the chiral limit",
    "the quark - gluon interaction is insensitive to the specific flavor of quarks .",
    "for example one can substitute , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks by properly normalized orthogonal linear combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks ( _ i.e. _ one can perform a rotation in the flavor space ) and nothing will change . since the left- and right - handed components are completely decoupled , one can perform two independent flavor rotations of the left- and right - handed components :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 are the isospin pauli matrices and the angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 parameterize rotations of the right- and left - handed components .",
    "these rotations leave the qcd lagrangian invariant .",
    "the symmetry group of these transformations ,    @xmath17    is called chiral symmetry .",
    "+ now generally if the hamiltonian of a system is invariant under some transformation group @xmath18 , then one can expect that one can find states which are simultaneously eigenstates of the hamiltonian and of the casimir operators of the group , @xmath19 .",
    "now , if the ground state of the theory , the vacuum , is invariant under the same group , _",
    "i.e. _ if for all @xmath20 @xmath21 then eigenstates of this hamiltonian corresponding to excitations above the vacuum can be grouped into degenerate multiplets corresponding to the particular representations of @xmath18 .",
    "this mode of symmetry is usually referred to as the wigner - weyl mode .",
    "conversely , if ( [ symvaccond ] ) does not hold , the excitations do not generally form degenegerate multiplets in this case .",
    "this situation is called spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "+ if chiral symmetry were realized in the wigner - weyl mode , then the excitations would be grouped into representations of the chiral group .",
    "the representations of the chiral group are discussed in detail in one of the following sections .",
    "the important feature is that the every representation except the trivial one ( which by quantum numbers can not include baryons ) necessarily implies parity doubling . in other words , for every baryon with the given quantum numbers and parity , there must exist another baryon with the same quantum numbers but opposite parity and which must have the same mass . in the case of mesons",
    "the chiral representations combine , e.g. the vector mesons with the axial vector mesons , which should be degenerate .",
    "this feature is definitely not observed for the low - lying states in hadron spectra .",
    "this means that eq .",
    "( [ symvaccond ] ) does not apply ; the chiral symmetry of qcd lagrangian is spontaneously ( dynamically ) broken in the vacuum , _ i.e. _ it is hidden .",
    "such a mode of symmetry realization is referred to as the nambu - goldstone one .",
    "+ the independent left and right rotations ( [ rot ] ) can be represented equivalently with independent isospin and axial rotations    @xmath22    in the wigner - weyl mode , the invariance under these transformations implies three conserved vector and three conserved axial vector currents .",
    "the existence of approximately degenerate isospin multiplets in hadron spectra suggests that the vacuum is invariant under the isospin transformation . indeed , from the theoretical side the vafa - witten theorem @xcite guarantees that in the local gauge theories the vector part of chiral symmetry can not be spontaneously broken .",
    "the axial transformation mixes states with opposite parity .",
    "the fact that all states do not have parity doublets implies that the vacuum is not invariant under the axial transformations . in other words the almost perfect chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian",
    "is dynamically broken down by the vacuum to the vectorial ( isospin ) subgroup    @xmath23    the noninvariance of the vacuum with respect to the three axial transformations requires existence of three massless goldstone bosons , which should be pseudoscalars and form an isospin triplet .",
    "these are identified with pions .",
    "the nonzero mass of pions is entirely due to the _ explicit _ chiral symmetry breaking by the small masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks .",
    "these small masses can be accounted for as a perturbation . as a result",
    "the squares of the pion masses are proportional to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quark masses @xcite    @xmath24    @xmath25    that the vacuum is not invariant under the axial transformation is directly seen from the nonzero values of the quark condensates , which are an order parameter for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "these condensates are the vacuum expectation values of the @xmath26 operator and at the renormalization scale of 1 gev they approximately are    @xmath27    the values above are deduced from phenomenological considerations @xcite .",
    "lattice gauge calculations also confirm the nonzero and rather large values for quark condensates .",
    "however , the quark condensates above are not the only order parameters for chiral symmetry breaking",
    ". there exist chiral condensates of higher dimension ( vacuum expectation values of more complicated combinations of @xmath28 and @xmath29 that are not invariant under the axial transformations ) .",
    "their numerical values are difficult to extract from phenomenological data , however , and they are still unknown .",
    "+ to summarize this section .",
    "there exists overwhelming evidence that the nearly perfect chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian is spontaneously broken in the qcd vacuum .",
    "physically this is because the vacuum state in qcd is highly nontrivial which can be seen by the condensation in the vacuum state of the chiral pairs .",
    "these condensates break the symmetry of the vacuum with respect to the axial transformations and as a consequence , there is no parity doubling in the low - lying spectrum .",
    "however , as we shall show , the role of the chiral symmetry breaking quark condensates becomes progressively less important once we go up in the spectrum , _ i.e. _ the chiral symmetry is effectively restored , which should be evidenced by the systematical appearance of the approximate parity doublets in the highly lying spectrum .",
    "this is the subject of the following sections .",
    "one key theoretical idea underlying this review is that effect of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking on the spectrum becomes progressive less important as one studies states higher in the spectrum .",
    "as will be discussed later , this can be seen directly from qcd .",
    "it is none - the - less instructive to consider a simple quantum mechanical system with some underlying symmetry that is broken and accordingly is not readily apparent in the low lying spectrum but which is effectively restored to good approximation for high lying states . in this section",
    "we will discuss such a system in the context of single particle quantum mechanics .",
    "this example will illustrate how this general phenomenon can come about .",
    "the example we consider is a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( with an underlying @xmath30 symmetry ) with an added strong symmetry breaking term .",
    "we choose the harmonic oscillator only for simplicity ; the property that will be discussed below is quite general one and can be seen in systems with other type of symmetry .",
    "+ before discussing the example in any detail we wish to stress that the example is not in perfect analogy to the problem of interest in a number of ways . in the first place ,",
    "the symmetry breaking in our pedagogical example is explicit while in the case of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd the principal effect of symmetry breaking on the spectrum is due to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "secondly , in our pedagogical example the spectrum is discrete while in the qcd case the spectrum is continuous .",
    "thus , one of the essential question in the qcd case``are the states still resonant when they are high enough in the spectrum for symmetry breaking to effective turn off?''simply does not arise in this section . however , the example will make clear one essential thing : it is quite possible to have a system in which a symmetry breaking effect destroys the effect of a symmetry for the low lying spectrum ( as seen by the lack of a multiplet structure ) while to very good approximation the symmetry is manifest high in the spectrum .",
    "+ the unperturbed system we consider is a two dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "we can always choose our units of time such that the vibration frequency is unity and our units on distance so that the spring constant is unity .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system is    @xmath31    this hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of creation and annihilation operators    @xmath32    @xmath33    with @xmath34    the hamiltonian above is a quadratic form in both @xmath35 and @xmath36 and as such is invariant under @xmath30 ( or equivalently @xmath37 ) transformations :    @xmath38    this symmetry has profound consequences on the spectrum of the system .",
    "the energy levels of this unperturbed system are trivially found and are given by @xmath39 where @xmath1 is the principle quantum number ( which is the sum of the harmonic excitation quanta , @xmath40 ) , and m is the ( two dimensional ) angular momentum .",
    "the interesting point is that as a consequence of the symmetry , the levels are @xmath41-fold degenerate .",
    "in contrast , without the additional @xmath42 symmetry inherent to the harmonic oscillator , the two - dimensional rotations imply the @xmath43 symmetry which requires that levels be two - fold degenerate for all @xmath44 . +",
    "now suppose we add to the hamiltonian a @xmath42 symmetry breaking interaction ( but which is still @xmath43 invariant ) of the form    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are parameters and @xmath48 is the step function . clearly , @xmath49 is not invariant under the transformation of eq .",
    "( [ su2trans ] ) .",
    "thus the @xmath42 symmetry is explicitly broken by this additional interaction , that acts only within a circle of radius @xmath47 . as a result one would expect that the eigenenergies will not reflect the degeneracy structure of seen in eq .",
    "( [ hoeigen ] ) . of course",
    ", if either @xmath46 or @xmath47 is sufficiently small one expects to find _ nearly _ degenerate multiplets ( [ hoeigen ] ) everywhere in the spectrum .",
    "however , if the coefficients are sufficiently large one would expect to find no obvious remnants of the multiplets low in the spectrum .",
    "indeed , we have solved numerically for the eigenstates for the case of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( in these dimensionless units ) and one does not see an approximate multiplet structure in the low lying spectrum as can be seen in fig .  1 .",
    "this is not so surprising , the parameters were chosen to be big enough to wipe out the `` would be '' degeneracy structure .",
    "+    @xmath52    what is interesting for the present context is the high - lying spectrum . in fig .  1 we have also plotted the energies between 70 and 74 for a few of the lower @xmath53 s ( again for the case of @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "a multiplet structure is quite evident  to very good approximation the states of different @xmath53 s form degenerate multiplets and , although we have not shown this in the figure these multiplets extend in @xmath53 up to @xmath54 . thus the symmetry breaking interaction of eq  ( [ vsb ] ) plays a dominant role in the spectroscopy for small energies and becomes insignificant at higher energies . at higher energies ,",
    "the spectroscopy reveals the @xmath42 symmetry of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "+ how does this happen ?",
    "after all , the symmetry breaking term in this case is explicitly there in the hamiltonian so how is it that it is not seen high in the spectrum ?",
    "in fact , it _ is _ seen high in the spectrum .",
    "the highly - lying levels shown in fig .  1 are _ not _ degenerate , they are merely almost degenerate .",
    "the key point is that the effect of the symmetry breaking term is very small high in the spectrum and vanishes asymptotically high .",
    "our central thesis is that something very similar happens for the case of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "+ in the pedagogic case considered above , it is quite clear why the symmetry breaking term becomes unimportant high in the spectrum .",
    "for very high lying states the energy of the state is much larger than the symmetry breaking interaction over the entire range where the symmetry breaking interaction acts and the wavefunction amplitude is very small within the circle where the perturbation acts .",
    "thus , the wave function starting at the origin and over entire space is , to very good approximation is simply solution to the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ ho ] ) .",
    "the effect of the symmetry breaking term then acts as a perturbation    @xmath55    clearly as @xmath56 the effect of the symmetry breaking term on the wave function and energies vanishes .",
    "+ one thing about this simple problem is worth noting .",
    "while the effect of symmetry breaking becomes increasingly unimportant as one goes higher up in the spectrum , there is nothing discontinuous about the changes in the spectrum ; the spectrum smoothly changes from one regime to another . while there is a transition from the symmetry breaking regime low in the spectrum to the explicit symmetry regime asymptotically high in the spectrum ,",
    "it should not be confused with a phase transition in the thermodynamic sense for a number of reasons . in the first place we are describing single states and",
    "not an intensive quantity .",
    "secondly , the transition is smooth and to the extent that it has a thermodynamic analog it would correspond to a cross - over and not to a phase transition .",
    "we expect that in qcd as in our toy model there will be a gradual transition in the spectrum from the low energy regime where spontaneous chiral - symmetry - breaking effects are central to the physics to the high energy regime where they are very small .",
    "+ to summarize this section , we have shown an explicit example in two dimensional quantum mechanics where a system with an underlying symmetry is subjected to a symmetry breaking effect ( in this case an explicitly symmetry breaking interaction ) which destroys the multiplet structure in the spectrum associated with the symmetry for low lying states but for which the high lying spectrum retains the multiplet structure with nearly degenerate members of the multiplet .",
    "our central argument is that something analogous happens in qcd : a symmetry breaking effect ( in this case due to spontaneous symmetry breaking ) affects the low - lying part of the spectrum and ruins the `` would be '' multiplet structure .",
    "high in the spectrum however this symmetry breaking effect plays a very small role and to good approximation the spectrum reflects the underlying chiral symmetry . as mentioned above , the analogy between the two cases is not perfect  the qcd case depends on spontaneous symmetry breaking while the simple example is based on explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , in the qcd the states of interest are in the continuum while in the toy problem they are discrete . + the distinction between a continuous versus a discrete spectrum however raises critical issues . accordingly ,",
    "in the following section we will discuss a tool , the spectral density , which enables us to ask sensible questions about a continuous spectrum .",
    "as noted above , the fact that all high lying states in the qcd spectrum are in the continuum complicates any discussion about possible multiplets of hadrons high in the spectrum .",
    "the difficulty is that there are states at any energy and thus some means must be found for differentiating between the states at different masses . to proceed",
    ", one must find some probe that samples these states and one can ask how strongly the probe couples to states at various masses .",
    "this strength can be parameterized in a spectral density . before discussing in any mathematical detail how this",
    "is done a few general comments are in order .",
    "the spectral density does not simply tell us about the states , it also tells about the probe , thus it may seem to be ill - suited to providing fundamental information about the spectrum .",
    "however , there are cases where information about the spectrum more generally can be learned . for example , if the system has discrete bound states then the spectral density represents a set of @xmath57 functions at masses corresponding to the bound states . while the strength multiplying the @xmath57 functions are properties of the probe as well as the states ,",
    "the masses in the arguments of the @xmath57 function are independent of the probe and only tell you about the states in the spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , the case of interest to us here is in the continuum so in principle one always contaminates the information about the underlying spectrum with the information about the probe .",
    "however , if the spectrum is strongly resonant and the resonances are well separated then there will be a narrow region with large spectral strength_i.e . _ a large bump .",
    "clearly the height of the bump will depend on the details of the probe however the position of the bump will be large insensitive .",
    "there is some sensitivity of the position of the spectral bump to the probe as there is always some ambiguity in separating the resonance contribution from the background but for narrow resonances this ambiguity is small . thus , provided the spectrum of interest is in a region of well - defined resonances we can use any convenient probe and use the spectral density to determine the resonance position .",
    "+ the easiest context to deal with a spectral density is the two - point correlation function . consider a `` local current '' , @xmath58 which we can construct entirely out of quark and gluon fields .",
    "we will choose @xmath58 to be gauge invariant and to carry the quantum numbers we wish to study .",
    "a useful listing of a number of such currents for various spin - flavor quantum numbers along with their transformation properties under chiral transformations is given in ref .",
    "we can use @xmath59 to probe the vacuum_i.e .",
    "_ we act with @xmath59 on the vacuum and create the state with the quantum numbers of @xmath59 , let this state propagate and act again with @xmath59 to bring the system back to the vacuum . in the processes we learn about the propagation of all possible states with the quantum numbers of @xmath59 .",
    "+ sometimes such a current is directly accessible experimentally .",
    "for example , if one chooses the usual electromagnetic current , one is able to study the response of the vacuum to this vector probe , which is represented by the excitations of vector mesons at low @xmath60 and by jet production at the very high @xmath60 .",
    "these vector mesons which smoothly transform into jets once the momentum transfer increases , are directly observable in the process @xmath61 . the total cross - section of this process is directly connected to the imaginary part of the 2-point correlator of the current in the time - like ( minkowsi ) domain .",
    "the experimental study of this process , in particular in the regime @xmath62 , was historically one of the most important arguments for acceptance of qcd .",
    "indeed , because of asymptotic freedom , qcd predicts that in the regime @xmath62 the correlator is adequately described by the free quark loop diagram ( i.e. the photon creates from the vacuum the quark - antiquark pair , which freely propagates to the point where they are annihilated by the photon ) .",
    "the spectral density is given by the imaginary part of this diagram in the time - like region and is measurable as a total cross - section .",
    "this process is described in standard texts on qcd @xcite .",
    "+ if one uses the weak axial vector current , which is experimentally accessible in decays of @xmath63-lepton , then one studies the response of the vacuum to the axial - vector probe ; this is reflected in the excitations of axial vector mesons , etc . for our purposes",
    "it is not necessary that the spectral function associated with the current to be experimentally accessible .",
    "for example , there is no experimental probe of a local current that creates three quarks from the vacuum .",
    "the two - point correlators with these currents give information about the baryon spectrum .",
    "such currents can be constructed theoretically @xcite , however , and they represent a tool to study baryons in qcd sum rules and lattice gauge calculations @xcite .",
    "+ consider for simplicity the two - point correlation function for a lorentz scalar ( or pseudoscalar ) @xmath59 defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the vacuum state and @xmath66 represents a time - ordered product .",
    "this correlation function can be written in standard kllen - lehmann form @xcite    @xmath67    the spectral density @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69    and has the physical interpretation of being proportional to the probability density that the current @xmath59 when acting on the vacuum creates a state of a mass of @xmath70 .",

    "this is because the masses of these states were extracted from rather old phase shift analysis and the results of different groups often do not coincide with each other .",
    "+ though one can not rule out the possibility that the approximate mass degeneracy between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 doublets is accidental ( which would presumably mean that that the baryons are organized according to @xmath138 for @xmath1 and @xmath140 for @xmath2 parity - chiral doublets ) , we believe that this fact supports the idea ( ii ) that the highly excited states fall into approximately degenerate multiplets @xmath139 . + it can also be possible that in the narrow energy interval more than one parity doublet in the nucleon and delta spectra is found for a given spin .",
    "this would then mean that different doublets would belong to different parity - chiral multiplets .",
    "+ while a discovery of states that are marked by ( ? ) would support the idea of effective chiral symmetry restoration , a definitive discovery of states that are beyond the systematics of parity doubling , would certainly be strong evidence against it .",
    "the nucleon states listed above exhaust all states ( `` * * * * '' , `` * * * '' , `` * * '' , `` * '' ) in this part of the spectrum included by the pdg . however , there are some additional candidates ( not established states ) in the @xmath2 spectrum . in the @xmath153 channel",
    "there are two other candidate states @xmath154 and @xmath155 ; there is another candidate for @xmath156 positive parity state - @xmath157 as well as for @xmath158 negative parity state @xmath159 .",
    "certainly a better exploration of the highly lying baryons is needed .",
    "this task is just for the facilities like in jlab , bnl , saphir , spring-8 and similar .",
    "+ recent experimental data from saphir ( bonn ) @xcite indicate two additional states in the nucleon spectrum :    @xmath160    what is interesting , the states again appear as approximate parity doublets .",
    "it is not clear at the moment whether or not these new states should be actually identified with those states above mentioned in pdg .",
    "in this short review we have shown that the chiral symmetry of qcd must be restored smoothly as one goes up in the hadron spectra .",
    "the arguments are based very general properties such as quark - hadron duality , asymptotic freedom in qcd and the validity of the operator product expansion in qcd . using these",
    "we have demonstrated that asymptotically high in the spectrum , the spectral densities obtained with local currents that transform into each other under chiral transformations , must coincide .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the low - lying part of the spectra where these spectral densities are very different due to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "physically this is quite easy to understand .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking of the vacuum is simply not important high in the spectrum , while it is crucial for the low - lying states .",
    "+ to the extent that the identifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high excitations the effective chiral symmetry restoration in the spectral densities implies that the highly excited hadrons should fall into multiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group . in other words ,",
    "the spectrum of highly excited @xmath1 and @xmath2 states should consist of the approximate parity doublets or higher multiplets .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( i ) the parity doublet in the nucleon spectrum is not degenerate with the doublet of the same spin in the delta spectrum .",
    "this would imply that these doublets belong to different chiral multiplets  to @xmath138 for @xmath1 and to @xmath140 for @xmath2 ; ( ii ) the parity doublets of the same spin in nucleon and delta spectra are degenerate .",
    "then it would support the possibility that both parity doublets belong to the same multiplet ",
    "the small splitting in these doublets is due to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking by small masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks as well as due to the remaining small effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the latter effects vanish completely only asymptotically high , where the identifiable hadrons probably do not exist in the real world .",
    "+ we have shown that the existing old data on highly excited @xmath1 and @xmath2 baryons in the region of 2 gev and higher do support this picture .",
    "however new experimental studies are necessary to reach definitive conclusion on whether nature realizes approximate chiral symmetry restoration in this region .",
    "such studies could be performed with the existing facilities .",
    "+ one question which arises is why do we see the chiral symmetry restoration in baryon spectrum but no such evidences in meson spectrum ? indeed , the approximate chiral symmetry restoration would require that e.g. the highly excited vector and axial vector mesons also form approximate parity doublets .",
    "if one looks at the pdg tables , then one finds the vector mesons at the following masses @xmath161",
    ", @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "there are , however , only two axial vector meson states : @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "as expected from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , there is no parity doubling low in the spectrum .",
    "( compare the mass of @xmath161 and @xmath165 ) . however , there is no hint of parity doubling high in the spectrum at masses of 2 gev , as one sees in the baryon spectrum .",
    "one possible reason is trivial however  with the present experimental possibilities available to date one might expect to have trouble seeing such a doubling in meson spectrum . in the case of baryons ,",
    "the nucleon targets exist and one can perform direct experiments on high excitation of nucleons by different projectiles such as pions , protons , electrons or photons .",
    "the multipole analysis needed to extract resonances in various channels is relatively straightforward . on the other hand",
    ", the meson targets do not exist ; except in a few cases the only way to extract the meson spectrum is from indirect experiments .",
    "for example , the vector mesons are obtained directly from the @xmath167 annihilation process , which is well explored and the @xmath168 mesons are indeed known up to 2 gev region . the extraction of higher vector mesons is more difficult due to the opening of the hidden charm production channel .",
    "the axial vector mesons are obtained directly from the weak decay of the @xmath63-lepton .",
    "the mass of @xmath63 is 1777 mev , which guarantees that we could not observe the possible axial vector mesons in the 2 gev region .",
    "other types of experiments are necessary .",
