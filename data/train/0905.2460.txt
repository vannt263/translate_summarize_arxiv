    "a single electron spin in semiconductor quantum dot is an attractive candidate for a solid - state quantum bit  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated the capability of reading , writing , and controlling of single spin in different iii - v quantum dot systems , by optical means  @xcite , or electric means  @xcite .",
    "an outstanding bottleneck towards spin - based quantum computation has been the fast dephasing of the electron spin by the nuclear spin environment in the iii - v materials . even at temperature as low as @xmath0 mk ,",
    "the thermal statistical fluctuation of the nuclear spin configurations still corresponds to a large inhomogeneous broadening in nuclear hyperfine field , which dephases the electron spin in a timescale of @xmath1 ns  @xcite .",
    "spin echo approach can transiently remove inhomogeneous dephasing at certain spin - echo times for an ultrashort duration equal to @xmath2 time  @xcite , but this may be insufficient to allow the general quantum logic controls .    in principle , the nuclear field inhomogeneous broadening can be narrowed below its thermal value after proper procedures of nuclear state preparation  @xcite , and the resultant enhancement on the @xmath3 time can last for seconds or even longer as nuclear spin relaxation is extremely slow .",
    "this could be a solution for preparing a spin qubit with desirable coherence properties .",
    "for optically controllable electron spin in self - assembled dot , enhancement of @xmath3 up to microsecond timescales by nuclear state preparation has been achieved for a spin ensemble  @xcite , and for a single spin  @xcite . for",
    "electrically controlled double quantum dot , an experimental paper has reported that a cyclic control of the two - electron state through the resonance between the singlet and one triplet state can enhance the inhomogeneous dephasing time of the two - spin states to microsecond timescale  @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological model was later proposed which shows that such control could result in negative feedback to suppress the fluctuation of longitudinal nuclear field gradient and as a result the two - spin dephasing time can be enhanced  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    in this work , we present a theory for the interplay between electron and nuclear spins near the singlet - triplet resonances of coupled double dot in moderate external magnetic field .",
    "the transition from the singlet to a triplet in resonance can either be realized through a first order process by the electron - nuclear flip - flop term in the hyperfine coupling , or through a second order hyperfine process mediated by another detuned triplet state .",
    "we show that the quantum interference between the first order and the second order hyperfine processes leads to a feedback mechanism for manipulating the nuclear field components .",
    "the theory provides a unified framework for realizing negative and positive feedback controls by bringing the system through the singlet - triplet resonances .",
    "a non - intuitive prediction is that negative and positive feedbacks can be realized not only for longitudinal nuclear field gradients , but also for the nuclear field components transverse to the external field while nuclear spins are being dynamically polarized in the longitudinal direction .",
    "this has not been possible in other feedback mechanisms being explored  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the possibility of enhancing the dephasing time of each individual spin in a cluster of dots using this negative feedback control on the transverse nuclear field .",
    "we first briefly explain the energy level scheme which is controlled by voltages applied to electrostatic gates in the double dot system , as demonstrated in a number of recent experiments  @xcite . a schematic energy - level diagram with @xmath4 indicating the charge occupancies of the left and right dots is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "a total of five two - electron states are involved : the singlet and triplet states of the @xmath5 charge configuration , and the singlet state of the @xmath6 charge configuration .",
    "all other states are well detuned and can be neglected .",

    "away from the @xmath10 charge degeneracy point , the residual inter - dot tunneling results in an exchange splitting between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which allows the @xmath12 state to be degenerate with @xmath14 or @xmath15 at negative or positive @xmath7 .",
    "dynamical nuclear spin polarization ( dnp ) is highly efficient at the @xmath16 and @xmath17 degeneracies since energy conservation can be directly satisfied  @xcite .",

    "the feedback effect is inversely proportional to the magnetic field . in the meantime",
    ", the perturbation treatment requires the magnetic field to be much larger than the nuclear field gradient which is of the typical value @xmath73 mt for a thermalized nuclear spin bath .",

    "a semiclassical picture helps to understand the underlying physics behind this feedback .",
    "the nuclear field gradient perturbs the electron spin eigenstates in the uniform external field , which results in an electron spin polarization gradient in the perturbed @xmath12 state .",
    "the electron spin polarization gradient in turn determines the back - action to the nuclear spin bath upon the electron - nuclear flip - flop , which completes the feedback loop for manipulating the nuclear field gradient .",
    "one can further anticipate a similar feedback effect on the transverse nuclear field as well in the dnp process . in the presence of a transverse nuclear field , the total effective magnetic field for the electron",

    "we note that the larmor precession of nuclear spins in a moderate magnetic field of 10 mt is in the order of @xmath97 mhz , which is much smaller as compared to the magnitude of the transition matrix element for the electron - nuclear flip - flop @xmath98 mhz .",
    "thus , the effect of nuclear spin larmor precession on the hyperfine driven @xmath68 transition can be well neglected .",
    "uniform precession of nuclear spins during other slower parts of the control cycle does not change the value of @xmath99 .    from eq .",

[ fig1 ] ) . by tuning @xmath7 to negative value via gate - control ,",
    "the two - electron wavefunction can be adiabatically evolved to @xmath12 state . as the evolution is slowly passed through the @xmath16 degeneracy ,",
    "the hyperfine driven @xmath68 transition is expected to occur with a simultaneous flip down of one nuclear spin .",
    "the gate - control can then be rapidly brought back to the large and positive @xmath7 , waiting for the double dot to be initialized again to the @xmath11 state . by repeating the above cycle at a rate of @xmath103 mhz in an external field @xmath104 mt",
    ", nuclear spins are expected to be dynamically polarized in the direction longitudinal to the external field .",
    "the experiment is performed at a temperature ( @xmath0 mk ) many orders larger than the nuclear zeeman energy ( @xmath105 mk ) , so the initial nuclear spin bath under thermal equilibrium has equal probability on every possible spin - configuration . before the dnp pump is applied , the observed ensemble dephasing time @xmath106 ns between the spin states @xmath107 and @xmath108 is in agreement with the calculated fluctuation @xmath109 for this thermal nuclear distribution  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is found to be enhanced by the cyclic dnp pumping .",
    "after a pump time @xmath110 s , @xmath2 saturates at @xmath111s , which indicates that @xmath112 has been suppressed by a factor of @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "measurement also shows that this cyclic pumping establishes a steady - state nuclear spin polarization of @xmath114 .",
    "we use @xmath115 to denote the dnp rate , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of hyperfine driven @xmath68 transition per unit time .",
    "eq.([eq : feedback - gradient ] ) leads to the equation of motion @xmath116 which states that @xmath112 decreases in an exponential form : @xmath117 .",
    "according to this exponential behavior , with a dnp rate of @xmath118 mhz , suppression of the fluctuation by a factor of @xmath119 can be achieved in a timescale of @xmath120 s. to achieve this degree of suppression , the total number of nuclear spins flipped down by the dnp cycles shall be @xmath121 , corresponding to a nuclear polarization of @xmath114 .",
    "the steady - state value of the fluctuation is reached when the two terms on the rhs of eq.([eq : eom ] ) cancel .",
    "so this residual fluctuation can be calculated @xmath122 s@xmath35 , corresponding to a dephasing time @xmath123s .    by preparing the nuclear spin environment with the above cyclic negative feedback control ,",
    "the longitudinal nuclear fields in the two dots are set to the same value regardless of the initial state .",
    "the coherence of the physical qubit represented by the two - spin states is therefore protected from the statistical fluctuation of the nuclear field in each individual dot . since",
    "nuclear spin relaxation is extremely slow , the resultant enhancement on the @xmath3 time can last for seconds or even longer .",
    "it will be desirable to generalize this preparation scheme for single spin in individual dot .",
    "here we argue that the negative feedback on the average transverse nuclear field in the hyperfine driven @xmath100 transition may potentially be utilized to enhance the dephasing time of each single spin in a cluster of dots .",
    "as an example , we consider a three - phase control cycle in a three - dot system . in phase 1 of the cycle ,",
    "dot 1 and dot 2 are coupled and both are decoupled from dot 3 .",
    "the two - electron state in dot 1 and 2 is evolved in the sequence @xmath124",
    "@xmath124 @xmath124 @xmath124 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) to realize the hyperfine driven @xmath125 transition .",
    "this evolution can be realized by an experimental control similar to the one used in ref .",
    "the loop consists of four parts : ( i ) tuning @xmath7 with inter - dot tunneling switched off ( @xmath124 ) ; ( ii ) the adiabatic evolution from @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( @xmath124 ) ; ( iii ) the hyperfine driven @xmath126 transition ( @xmath124 ) ; ( iv ) re - initialization to the @xmath11 by relaxation ( @xmath124 ) . in phase 2 ( phase 3 ) of the cycle",
    ", we repeat the same control for dot 2 and 3 ( dot 3 and 1 ) . the fluctuations in @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129",
    "are all reduced in this three - phase control cycle .",
    "since these three linearly independent vectors remain uncorrelated throughout the control , we have @xmath130 therefore , the fluctuation of the transverse nuclear field in each individual dot gets reduced in this three - phase control cycle . after the preparation of nuclear spin bath with the above cycles ,",
    "if the external magnetic field is rotated to one of the transverse direction , an enhanced single spin dephasing time @xmath131 in the new external field is expected .    for the qubit represented by the two - spin states @xmath107 and @xmath108 , gradient in the longitudinal nuclear field can realize a rotation about the @xmath9 axis .",
    "positive feedback which increases the magnitude of the nuclear field gradient is also of interest since a larger gradient means a faster gate operation .",
    "a recent experiment has reported universal quantum control of the two - spin qubit in a coupled double - dot where the nuclear field gradient is magnified by nuclear state preparation @xcite .",
    "the experiment uses two types of controls which realize the @xmath68 transition and the @xmath132 transition respectively in an external field of @xmath110 t. such a large external field will deactivate the negative feedback in the @xmath68 transition . for the @xmath132 transition ,",
    "the back - action on the nuclear state is described by the operator @xmath133 which does result in a positive feedback on the longitudinal nuclear field gradient .",
    "however , the large external field will make it difficult to initiate the magnification by the positive feedback .",
    "the validity of our theory is likely to be restricted in moderate external field for both negative and positive feedbacks , and the mechanism for the magnification of the nuclear field gradient in this experiment is still unclear .",
    "for coupled double dot system in moderate external magnetic field , we have shown that the interference of first order and second order hyperfine processes results in a feedback mechanism for manipulating the nuclear hyperfine fields when the two - electron singlet state is brought into resonance with one triplet state . in principle",
    ", the feedback controls here do not need explicit measurement steps .",
    "re - initialization of the control loop is simply realized by the relaxation to the ground state @xmath11 at large positive @xmath7 , which can be ensured after sufficiently long waiting time .",
    "the nondeterminacy lies in the electron - nuclear flip - flop at the singlet - triplet resonance , but whether it has occurred or not , the double - dot will return to the initial state @xmath11 at the end of a control cycle .",
    "the probability for the electron - nuclear flip - flop in a single cycle corresponds to the ratio between the actual dnp rate @xmath115 and the repetition rate of the control cycles .    for negative feedback controls aimed at suppressing the nuclear field fluctuations , spectral diffusion of nuclear hyperfine fields caused by various processes  @xcite could be a competing mechanism in determining the residual fluctuations in the steady state",
    "this element has not been included in the present discussion .",
    "further studies are needed to investigate the quantitative effects of spectral diffusions ."
