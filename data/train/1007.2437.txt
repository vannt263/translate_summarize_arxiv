    "in the so called factorization theorems , see for instance  @xcite , the scattering process with a single large transverse momentum scale ( short distance interaction ) , can be described in the perturbative qcd  @xcite ( pqcd ) in terms of the on - shell hard process matrix element convoluted with the _ ladder part_. the hard process is calculable up to a fixed perturbative order .",
    "the ladder part , calculated for each coloured parton entering ( exiting ) the hard process , is conveniently described as a tree - like stream of partons , parametrized by the inclusive parton distribution function , pdf .",
    "the logarithmic response of the inclusive pdf to the change of the large @xmath0 scale is the so called dglap@xcite evolution of the pdfs .",
    "this evolution was mastered for the inclusive pdfs up to nlo level in the early 80 s , see for instance  @xcite , and recently even to the nnlo level  @xcite .",
    "alternatively the parton tree encapsulated in the inclusive pdf can be modelled using direct stochastic simulation of their four - momenta and other attributes , the so - called monte carlo ( mc ) technique . here",

    "standard lo level psmc implements also the hadronization of quark and gluon partons into hadrons and is a workhorse in the software in all collider experiments .",
    "the advent of the lhc puts a challenging requirement on the quality of the pqcd calculations needed for the experimental data analysis .",
    "some of them will soon require that the psmc is upgraded to the complete nlo level .",
    "this , however is not an easy task , mainly because classic factorization theorems  @xcite are not well suited for the exclusive mc implementation , but rather for inclusive pdfs .    in this contribution",
    "we would like to report on the serious and successful attempt of solving the above problem of constructing nlo psmc .",
    "we shall overview main technical points and present some numerical tests of the scheme .",
    "possible profits from nlo psmc include : ( a )  complete set of `` unitegrated soft counterterms '' for combining hard process me at nnlo with nlo psmc ;",

    "the mc modelling of nlo dglap is not so much the aim itself  it will be rather a starting platform for many interesting developments in pqcd in many directions .    presently , we concentrate on constructing nlo psmc for qcd initial state radiation ( isr ) just for one initial parton such that : ( a )   it is based on the collinear factorization theorems @xcite as rigorously as possible , ( b )  we take scheme of curci - furmanski - petronzio ( cfp ) as a main reference and guide ( axial gauge , @xmath4 dimensional regularization ) , ( c )  nlo dglap evolution is reproduced exactly at the inclusive level ( c )  mc performs nlo evolution by itself , using new exclusive nlo evolution kernels , without help of external pretabulated inclusive pdfs .",
