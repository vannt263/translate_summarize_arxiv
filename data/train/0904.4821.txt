    "<S> when these spin - polarized electrons are transported to a second ferromagnet , e.g. by applying a voltage , then the spin angular momentum of the itinerant electrons will exert a torque on the local magnetic moment . </S>",

    "<S> since we are mainly interested in the properties of the right ferromagnet , we assume that the left one is half - metallic so that its minority states play no role for small voltages . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by using the mean field selfenergy @xmath48 with sufficiently large @xmath49 . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore we need the lesser component of the transport selfenergy which was already defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : delta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lesser part of the insulator green s function can again be calculated with the help of the keldysh equation : @xmath52 since the green s functions in the left ferromagnet and the paramagnet are equilibrium quantities , their lesser parts read @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fermi function in lead @xmath55 with chemical potential @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> they are related by @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have a closed set of equations for calculating the magnetization of the ferromagnet . +     between the metals and the insulator . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows indicate in which direction the voltage was changed . </S>",
    "<S> parameters : band occupation @xmath58 ; band widths : @xmath59 ev and @xmath60 ; interaction strengths : @xmath61 ; band center of the insulator @xmath62 ; hybridization strength : @xmath63 ev ; temperature : @xmath64    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switch ] a typical numerical solution for the voltage - dependent magnetization is shown . </S>",
    "<S> we will first discuss the black curve , which was calculated with a hybridization strength of @xmath65 ev . </S>",
    "<S> for the calculation we started with parallel alignment of the two magnetizations ( point @xmath66 in the figure ) </S>",
    "<S> . then a negative voltage is applied , i.e. the right ferromagnet is shifted to higher energies compared to the left one . at a critical voltage the parallel alignment becomes unstable and the magnetization reverses its sign ( @xmath67 to @xmath68 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the magnetizations are now antiparallel . </S>",
    "<S> when the voltage is further decreased the magnetization stays more or less constant until point @xmath69 is reached . </S>",
    "<S> then the process is reversed and the voltage is reduced to zero again . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization follows the same line as before until the switching point @xmath68 is reached . </S>",
    "<S> there it does not switch back to parallel alignment but rather stays at about the same level . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath70 is reached the direction of the voltage is reversed , i.e. the right ferromagnet will now be shifted to lower energies . for small voltages </S>",
    "<S> there is only a slight increase until a critical voltage is reached ( @xmath71 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this voltage has approximately the same value as the first one at point @xmath67 , but of course with an opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> there the antiparallel alignment is no longer stable and the systems returns to its initial parallel state which is not influenced by higher voltages ( @xmath72 to @xmath73 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the voltage is turned off and the system will be at its starting point @xmath66 again , so the hysteresis loop is complete . </S>",
    "<S> + as another test we start again at point @xmath66 , but this time we turn on a positive voltage </S>",
    "<S> . then no switching occurs and the system will move reversibly to point @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar reversible behaviour is seen when the alignment is antiparallel ( @xmath70 ) and the voltage is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown by the arrows in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> so , one has to conclude that switching of magnetization from parallel to antiparallel alignment is only possible for negative voltages and the reverse process will only appear for positive voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour just described is one of the hallmarks of current - induced switching of magnetization and thus our proposed model is indeed able to simulate this effect without leaving the microscopic picture ! +     for @xmath74 and @xmath65 ev . </S>",
    "<S> upper picture for parallel alignment of the magnetizations ( point a ) , lower picture for antiparallel alignment ( point e ) . </S>",
    "<S> spin up is shown along the positive , spin down along the negative axis . </S>",
    "<S> the black line is the qdos of the right ferromagnet , treated within the nsda , and the red broken line shows the qdos of the left ferromagnet in mean field . ]    </S>",
    "<S> now we want to give a short explanation on how exactly our model is able to provide these results . </S>",
    "<S> the key to the understanding lies in the effect the hybridization parts of the hamiltonian have on the quasiparticle density of states ( qdos ) of the switching magnet and in the polarization of the current . </S>",
    "<S> a hybridization between two bands generally will lead to a repulsion between them , i.e. the energetic distance between their respective centers of gravity will increase the stronger the effect of the hybridization is . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this shift is mainly influenced by three quantities : the strength of the hybridization itself ( @xmath29 and @xmath28 in our case ) , the energetic distance between the two bands ( the closer they are to each other , the stronger they will be repelled ) and their spectral weight ( higher spectral weight leads to stronger repulsion ) . in the upper part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qdos ] we plotted a typical qdos for the nsda without applied voltage for parallel alignment of the two magnetizations . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line represents the density of states of the left ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of the right qdos into lower and upper hubbard band at @xmath75 and @xmath76 is clearly visible . </S>",
    "<S> additionally there are contributions of the insulator at @xmath77 ev which are due to the hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> what happens when a voltage is turned on depends on its sign . </S>",
    "<S> the left ferromagnet fm1 is not influenced by the voltage , so its qdos will be the same . </S>",
    "<S> let us first discuss the case @xmath16 where both spin bands of the right ferromagnet fm2 are shifted to lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> but due to the repulsion between the spin up bands of fm1 and fm2 the shift of the spin up band will actually be stronger than for spin down , where the repulsion is much weaker . </S>",
    "<S> so a positive voltage leads to a stabilization of the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is enhanced by the current . </S>",
    "<S> for positive voltages it will flow from left to right . since the left ferromagnet is fully polarized there are only spin up electrons tunneling into the right ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> these are the reasons for the slight increase of magnetization in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switch ] between points a and h and also an explanation why there can be no switching in this case . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if we apply a negative voltage , @xmath78 , the right spin bands will be shifted to higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reasons as discussed above the shift of the spin up band will be enhanced by the hydridization . </S>",
    "<S> thus the difference between the centers of gravity of both spin bands will be decreased . </S>",
    "<S> if the hybridization strength is sufficiently large this additional shift together with the selfconsistency will be enough to push the spin up band above the spin down band and thus the magnetization changes sign . </S>",
    "<S> the selfconsistency is important since it will enhance the shift , because the occupation in one band depends on the occupation in the other one . in this case </S>",
    "<S> current flows from the right to the left lead . </S>",
    "<S> since there are only spin up states available for tunneling in the left ferromagnet , the tunneling current flowing out of the switching magnet will consist of spin up electrons only . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an additional decrease of the right magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the behaviour shown by the parallel aligned curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switch ] . </S>",
    "<S> + the antiparallel case can be explained in a very similar way . in the lower part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qdos ] the corresponding quasiparticle density of states is shown , again without applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the obvious difference to the case discussed above is that the center of gravity of the lower spin down band is below the lower spin up band . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason for the negative magnetization of course , but it is also responsible for the reversed behaviour with respect to the applied voltage . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a negative voltage can not push the center of gravity of the spin up band below the spin down band . </S>",
    "<S> it rather has the opposite effect because the repulsion pushes the spin up band to even higher energies and thus leads to a more stable magnetization which can also be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switch ] between points e and d. for a positive voltage the spin up band of fm2 moves below the spin up band of fm1 so that the hybridization will shift it to lower energies compared to the spin down band . again </S>",
    "<S> , if the hybridization strength is larger than a critical value this additional shift will be enough to reverse the two spin directions such that the magnetization changes sign . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reasons as discussed for the parallel case , a positive voltage will increase the magnetization , while a negative voltage has the opposite effect . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the behaviour of the magnetization in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switch ] can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle density of states . </S>",
    "<S> + in order to prove the explanation based on the hybridization we plotted a second magnetization curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switch ] with smaller hybridization strength @xmath79 ev . obviously in this case no switching occurs . </S>",
    "<S> there is only a slight change of magnetization . starting from parallel ( antiparallel ) alignment </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization is reduced for negative ( positive ) voltages . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the explanation given above . </S>",
    "<S> since the hybridization is weaker the repulsion between the bands is also reduced . </S>",
    "<S> it is not strong enough to push the spin down band above the spin up band or vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> thus the direction of magnetization is not changed . </S>",
    "<S> the current density through the junction is closely linked to the coupling strength between the materials@xcite : smaller @xmath28 corresponds to a weaker current . from the results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : switch ] we can conclude that in order to switch the magnetization the current has to exceed a certain value . + to summarize , we presented a selfconsistent calculation of the voltage - dependent magnetization in a magnetic tunnel junction within a microscopic non - equilibrium framework . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization shows a hysteresis behaviour similar to that seen in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this effect was explained to be the hybridization between left and right ferromagnets which could be seen with the help of the quasiparticle density of states . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the behaviour discussed above does only appear for very special parameter sets ( such as low band occupation , small u ) when one uses the mean field approximation for the right ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> this seems reasonable because it is known that mean field strongly overestimates the stability of ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> thus it should be more difficult to switch the direction of magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> we have to conclude that higher correlations seem to be an important factor when describing current - induced switching of magnetization within this model . </S>",
    "<S> one might argue that the kondo peak is missing in the nsda which should have considerable influence on the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> however , we investigated the strong - coupling regime only , where it is known that the kondo peak does not play a major role . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> it would be a very interesting expansion of the model to examine its weak - coupling behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> another important extension would be the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling which is widely believed to be the microscopic origin of phenomenological damping effects@xcite which play a crucial role in the macroscopic description of switching of magnetization . </S>"
