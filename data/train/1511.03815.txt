    "the bbgky hierarchy @xcite is an exact reformulation of the problem of interacting fermions where one - body degrees of freedom ( dofs ) are coupled to two - body dofs that are themselves coupled to three - body dofs and so one and so forth .",
    "one of the advantages of this hierarchy is that it illustrates how correlations can affect the evolution of the one - body density matrix .",
    "for this reason , the set of equations between one - body evolution and many - body correlations are often used as a starting point to develop approximations beyond mean - field ( see for instance @xcite ) . however , due to the increasing complexity occurring when complex correlations are included , a truncation scheme of the hierarchy is necessary .",
    "the proposal of an appropriate truncation of the bbgky hierarchy has been the subject of extensive work in the past @xcite and leads to the so - called time - dependent density matrix ( tddm ) approach to interacting systems where not only the one - body density is followed in time but also eventually the two - body and eventually three - body density matrices .",
    "the flexibility of choosing the proper equations of motion is still the subject of intensive work @xcite .",
    "in particular the absence of a definite strategy for truncating the bbgky can lead to uncontrolled results with varying quality as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite    it has been shown recently that the stochastic mean - field approach can provide rather accurate description of many - body effects beyond the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) or time - dependent hartree - fock bogolyubov ( tdhfb ) approach in several test cases @xcite where the approximate treatment can be confronted to the exact solution . in this approach ,",
    "the system is described by a set of initial conditions with fluctuating one - body density , followed by deterministic tdhf or tdhfb trajectories @xcite .",
    "each trajectory evolves through its own self - consistent mean - field for a given initial condition and is independent from the others . among the interesting aspects of the smf approach",
    "one can mention that beyond mean - field effects are incorporated although only mean - field type evolution is needed .",
    "one of the surprising results turns out to be that the smf technique can provide a better approximation compared to an approach where two - body degrees of freedom are explicitly introduced in the description @xcite .",
    "one of the main objectives of the present work is to clarify how a theory that only involves mean - field evolution can incorporate properly many - body effects .",
    "below , we make explicit connection between the smf approach and the bbgky hierarchy .",
    "we show that the smf theory is equivalent to solve a set of coupled equations between one - body dofs and higher - order correlations without truncation .",
    "this set of equations can be seen as a simplified version of the standard bbgky hierarchy .",
    "we finally explore if this simplified bbgky hierarchy can be used either as a numerical tool or to get physical insight in correlated systems if a truncation is assumed .",

    "the statistical properties of the density matrices are usually chosen in such a way that they reproduce at least in an approximate way the initial quantum phase - space of the problem .",
    "this is usually done by imposing specific properties of different moments of the initial density fluctuations @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 denotes here the statistical average over the initial conditions .",
    "most often , the moments are chosen to reproduce quantum fluctuations of the initial many - body states . in its original form @xcite",
    ", the smf theory has been formulated assuming ( i ) that the initial state is either a pure slater determinant or a statistical ensemble of independent particles . in both cases ,",
    "the one - body density is associated with occupation numbers denoted by @xmath17 in the canonical basis .",
    "( ii ) the initial quantum phase - space has been approximated by a gaussian statistical ensemble .",
    "then , initial phase - space sampling is completely specified by the first and second moments of @xmath18 that are conveniently chosen as : @xmath19   .\\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] starting from this original formulation , it has been realized that the smf approach can be extended to superfluid systems by replacing the n - body problem by a set of time - dependent hartree - fock bogolyubov ( tdhfb ) with initial fluctuations on both the normal and anomalous density matrices @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have shown recently that an improved treatment of the initial phase - space @xcite without the gaussian approximation can further ameliorate the many - body dynamics beyond the mean - field and allows to describe initially correlated many - body states .",
    "more surprisingly , a recent study on the hubbard model @xcite has shown that the smf approach can lead to a better than state of the art green function techniques including explicitly two - body effects @xcite .",
    "this actually might appear as a surprising result since in the smf approach only mean - field trajectories are required .",
    "it is one of the goals of the present article to show how correlations are incorporated in our theory . in particular , we show that the smf approach is equivalent to a simplified bbgky hierarchy where 2-body , 3-body , ... , n - body correlations are approximately propagated in time .      in the smf theory ,",
    "the quantum expectation value of any @xmath20-body operator is replaced by the a statistical average over the different trajectories .",
    "considering a set of @xmath20 one - body operators , denoted by @xmath21 , their expectation values within smf are given by @xmath22 therefore , the knowledge of any many - body observable is equivalent to the knowledge of the time evolution of the set of moments @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 defined through : @xmath27    we show in appendix [ app : bbgky ] , starting from the equation ( [ eq : smfgen ] ) that the different moments evolve according to the following coupled equations : @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   \\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{k } { \\rm tr}_{k+1 } \\left ( \\left[\\tilde v_{\\alpha k+1 } , m_{1 \\cdots k+1 } \\right ] \\right ) .\\label{eq : bbgky_m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations are formally very close to the bbgky hierarchy of density matrices in many - body systems @xcite except that here , the many - body densities are replaced by different moments of the density @xmath2 .",
    "another important difference is that part of the fermionic aspects are lost in this description .",
    "indeed , the moments @xmath29 here are symmetric with respect to the exchange of two indices .",
    "therefore , part of the quantum correlations induced by fermionic statistic are lost in the theory .",
    "this is one of the differences with the tddm approach where many - body densities truly associated to fermions are solved in time .",
    "one can equivalently rewrite the above set of equations as coupled equations between the average one - body density denoted for simplicity below as @xmath30 and the centered moments @xmath31 defined through : @xmath32 the resulting coupled equation are ( see appendix [ app : bbgky ] ) : @xmath33 + { \\rm tr}_2 \\left[\\tilde v_{12 } , c_{12 }    \\right ] , \\label{eq : etdhf1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with ( for @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k { \\rm tr}_{k+1 }    \\left[\\tilde v_{\\alpha k+1 } , c_{1 \\cdots k }    \\overline{\\rho_{k+1 } }    \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k { \\rm tr}_{k+1 }    \\left[\\tilde v_{\\alpha k+1 } ,   c_{1 \\cdots ( \\alpha-1 ) ( \\alpha+1 ) \\cdots ( k+1 ) } \\overline{\\rho_\\alpha } \\right]\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k { \\rm tr}_{k+1 }    \\left[\\tilde v_{\\alpha k+1 } ,    c_{1 \\cdots ( \\alpha-1 ) ( \\alpha+1 ) \\cdots k } c_{\\alpha k+1 }   \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k { \\rm tr}_{k+1 }    \\left[\\tilde v_{\\alpha k+1 } , c_{1 \\cdots ( k+1 ) }    \\right ] .",

    "this equation clearly points out that effects beyond the standard mean - field are accounted for in the smf approach . a more precise discussion on what many - body effects",
    "are included is given below .",
    "the fact that the smf approach is equivalent to solve an unrestricted set of coupled equations between the one - body density and higher - order moments is a clear advantage of this technique . as a direct conclusion ,",
    "it includes not only two - body effects but also higher order correlation effects .",
    "this might explain why , in previous applications , it has given better results compared to the calculation using bbgky hierarchy truncated at second order .    still , because of the replacement of quantum average by classical average , it is not anticipated that all many - body effects are properly included with the smf framework .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the inclusion of in - medium collisions can be made eventually by considering a langevin process where fluctuations are introduced continuously in time @xcite . regarding the pairing term ,",
    "although the complete proof is out of the scope of the present work , it is anticipated that this term is partially included when the superfluid version of smf is used @xcite .    on the positive side of smf we can remark :",

    "( [ eq : secondc ] ) shows that the term @xmath40 usually appearing in the second bbgky equation ( eq . ( 58 ) of @xcite ) , is approximately accounted for .",

    "( [ eq : secondc ] ) , it is interesting to note that the average density evolution can be rewritten as @xmath33 + \\overline{\\left[\\delta h[\\rho^{(n ) } ] , \\delta \\rho^{(n ) } \\right ] } .",
    "\\label{eq : etdhfalternative } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this alternative form evidences that the effect beyond mean - field stems from the correlation between the density fluctuation and the resulting mean - field fluctuation .",
    "such correlations and their effects on one - body dynamics have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for small amplitude vibrations around the ground state of atomic nuclei . in that case",
    ", they lead to a coupling of the collective motion to surface vibrations ( the so - called particle - phonon coupling ) .",
    "this coupling is known as a dominant source of fragmentation of the nuclear collective response at low temperature @xcite .",
    "the recent success of the smf approach and more particularly the good agreement between the approximate treatment and exact solutions in some model cases @xcite indicate that this approach retains some of the most important correlation effects and properly incorporate their effects on one - body degrees of freedom .",
    "the equivalent formulation given above in terms of a simplified bbgky hierarchy is helpful to clearly pinpoint the retained terms . as a side product of the present work",
    ", we note that the present development leads to a new approximate hierarchy of equations of motion that is much less involved than the standard bbgky one .",
    "in particular , it is commonly accepted that the main difficulty in many - body theories based on the truncation of the bbgky hierarchy is the absence of a systematic prescription to truncate the coupled equations at a given order @xcite .",
    "the coupled equations derived above can be seen as an alternative way to incorporate many - body effects .",
    "let us makes few remarks on the advantages of the new equations of motion : ( i ) first , the equation of motion are much simpler than the standard bbgky hierarchy , as we will see below , in some cases , third - order or even fourth order equation can be obtained without difficulty .",
    "( ii ) when possible , it is clear that it is preferable to directly perform the full smf theory , i.e. sample a set of mean - field trajectories .",
    "however , in some cases , this might become rather cumbersome due to number of trajectories required to get small statistical error - bars .",
    "then , the corresponding bbgky hierarchy can be an alternative approximate method to solve smf .",
    "( iii ) as we pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a proper account for the initial quantum phase - space might require to go beyond the gaussian assumption of the initial sampling .",
    "in simple models , it is possible to directly get the initial phase - space with some semi - classical techniques as in @xcite . in more complex systems",
    ", this seems more complicated and the sampling beyond the gaussian approximation might not be possible .",
    "alternatively , one can use the simplified bbgky hierarchy imposing that different moments at initial time exactly equals the initial quantum moments .",
    "( iv ) last , as we will see below , the simplified form of the bbgky equation can lead to interesting physical information .",
    "this is illustrated below , where approximate analytical expressions are obtained for the evolution including beyond mean - field effects .",
    "the goal of the present section is to illustrate the interesting aspects associated to the hierarchy of coupled equations motivated by the smf approach . for this purpose",
    ", we took as an example the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model @xcite that has already been used to benchmark the smf theory using phase - space initial sampling both in the gaussian @xcite and non - gaussian @xcite assumptions . in the two previous applications , a set of mean - field trajectories have been explicitly followed in time using the equations of motion : @xmath41 with fluctuating initial conditions . here ,",
    "@xmath42 are the three reduced quasi - spin components and @xmath43 is a constant that measures the strength of the two - body interaction .",
    "all technical details associated to the lmg model , its smf solution , as well as the possibility to get an exact solution have been extensively discussed in our previous work @xcite .    to get the closed set of equations , we follow the general strategy depicted above and separate the average quasi - spin from its fluctuation as @xmath44 . starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : smflipkin ] ) , we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the average fluctuations of the reduced quasi - spin .",
    "this evolution corresponds to the first coupled equation of the simplified bbgky hierarchy .",
    "higher order equation can be deduced from the equations of motion of the fluctuating part , that are given by : @xmath47 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "an illustration is given in appendix [ app : lipkinmoment ] for the evolution of second , third and fourth centered moments , denoted respectively by @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the average equation of motion greatly simplifies due to the fact that the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to the rotation @xmath51 . accordingly ,",

    "similarly , the third moments evolution induces a coupling to the 4th moments and so on and so forth .",
    "the explicit form of the third and fourth moments evolution are given in the appendix [ app : lipkinmoment ] .",
    "it should be noted that these equations are obtained in a rather straightforward way starting from the smf framework . in the following",
    ", the evolution obtained by truncating the set of equation to the second moments , third moments or fourth moments will be respectively referred to as quasi - classical tddm2 ( qc - tddm2 ) , qc - tddm3 and qc - tddm4 , while the original technique that samples the initial conditions and does not assume any truncation is simply referred to smf .",
    "we use as a benchmark the same initial condition as in ref .",
    "a system of @xmath58 particles initially described by the slater determinant @xmath59 is considered .",
    "this initial condition corresponds to the situation where all particles occupy the lowest level in the set of two - level system in the lmg model and all single - particle spins are @xmath60 .",
    "the initial non - zero moments corresponding to this state are given up to fourth order by : @xmath61    as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this initial condition is particularly critical for the tdhf theory since it corresponds exactly to the saddle point of a spontaneous symmetry breaking . accordingly",
    ", this initial state is just a stationary solution of tdhf while it is not stationary in the exact evolution .",
    "below , we consider the dynamical evolution in the weak and strong coupling regime .",
    "the frontier between these two regimes is determined by the interaction strength and by the presence ( @xmath62 ) or absence ( @xmath63 ) of a spontaneous symmetry breaking at the mean - field level . in practice , we assume that the weak coupling regime corresponds to @xmath64 , see for instance @xcite .      in many physical situations , we are mainly interested in the average evolution of one - body observables as well as their quantum fluctuations .",
    "standard time - dependent hartree - fock is usually convenient for the former one but provides a rather poor approximation for the fluctuations .",
    "we already know that the smf approach can greatly improve the description of two - body degrees of freedom from previous applications @xcite .",
    "we show here , that the qc - tddm2 approach where only the average quasi - spin and their fluctuations are followed in time , already provides a great improvement compared to the original tdhf .    in fig .",

    "we see that the qc - tddm2 approach does also provide the correct evolution of the second moments @xmath68 and @xmath69 even if higher order effects are neglected . only at large time , deviation with the exact solutions starts to be visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : weak1 ] .",
    "we see however that @xmath70 remains equal to zero in qc - tddm2 .",
    "this could have been anticipated from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) where we see that the only way to have @xmath70 evolving in time is to include the effects of third order moments .",
    "the good agreement between qc - tddm2 and the exact evolution in the weak coupling regime , despite the fact that it corresponds to a simplified bbgky hierarchy truncated at order 2 , is already an interesting result .",
    "this indirectly proves that smf is able to grasp some important physical effects . actually ,",
    "because of the simplicity of the qc - tddm2 approach , we can even obtain approximate analytical solutions for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . indeed , let us assume that the average evolution of @xmath71 can be approximated by its mean field solution in the evolution of second moments .",
