    "axions are likely to be the dark matter ( dm ) that cosmological data require .",
    "axions arise from the solution of the strong @xmath1 problem proposed by peccei & quinn in 1977 ( @xcite , pq hereafter ) , who suggested that @xmath2 parameter , in the effective lagrangian term @xmath3 ( @xmath4 : strong coupling constant , @xmath5 : gluon field tensor ) , causing @xmath1  violations in strong interactions , is a dynamical variable . under suitable conditions @xmath2 approaches zero in our epoch , so that the term ( [ eq : n1 ] ) is suppressed , while residual @xmath2 oscillations yield dm @xcite .    in the pq scheme ,",

    ". then @xmath11 settles at the potential minimum , while @xmath2 takes a random value , different in different horizons . when chiral symmetry also breaks down , during the quark ",
    "hadron transition , a further term @xmath12",
    "~(1 - \\cos \\theta )   \\label{eq : n3}\\ ] ] must be added to the lagrangian , because of instanton effects . at @xmath13 ,",
    "the square bracket approaches @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 : @xmath17meson mass , decay constant ) .",
    "the dependence on the site of initial @xmath2 s will causes later adjustments , as soon as the potential ( [ eq : n3 ] ) switches on .",
    "when @xmath2 is small , @xmath18 and the @xmath19 field , undergoing harmonic oscillations , is dm .",
    "0.05truecm    here we wish to discuss recent work [ 4 ] , where the ng potential ( [ eq : n2 ] ) is replaced by a tracker potential @xcite .",
    "then , instead of settling on a value @xmath20 , @xmath11 continues to evolve over cosmological times , at any @xmath21 . as in the pq case ,",
    "the potential involves a complex field @xmath22 and is @xmath8 invariant .",
    "its phase is horizon  dependent but , just as in the pq case , evolves only after chiral symmetry breaks , yielding a term similar to ( [ eq : n3 ] ) .    at variance from the pq case",
    ", however , the @xmath2 evolution starts and continues while also @xmath11 is still evolving .",
    "this goes on until our epoch , when @xmath11 is expected to account for dark energy ( de ) , while , superimposed to such slow evolution , faster _ transversal _",
    "@xmath2 oscillations occur , accounting for dm .",
    "this scheme , where the @xmath22 fields bears a dual role , with its modulus and phase , will be dubbed here _ dual _ axion model .",
    "the question is whether @xmath11 and @xmath2 dynamics interfere , still allowing @xmath2 to take values so small to solve the @xmath1 problem and preserving harmonic oscillations allowing the prescribed amount of dm .",
    "here we show that the reply is positive .",
    "as it can be expected , however , dm and de are dynamically coupled , although this coupling weakens as we approach the present era .    here",
    "we also consider a generalization of the sugra potential @xcite as an example of tracker potential . with an energy scale @xmath23gev",
    ", this model allows suitable values for today s dm and de densities , while @xmath2 is even smaller than for pq .",
    "dm density fluctuations are also able to grow and to account for the observed large scale structure .",
    "we fit the expected angular cbr spectra to data , finding that this model substantially performs as well as @xmath24cdm .",
    "in the dual - axion model we start from the lagrangian @xmath25 which can be rewritten in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath2 , adding also the term breaking the @xmath8 symmetry , as follows :    .3truecm @xmath26 - $ ]    @xmath27 .3truecm    here @xmath28 is the metric tensor .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 is the scale factor , @xmath31 is the conformal time ; greek ( latin ) indeces run from 0 to 3 ( 1 to 3 ) ; dots indicate differentiation in respect to @xmath31 .",
    "the mass behavior for @xmath32 will be detailed in section 3 .",
    "the equations of motion read @xmath33 -.8truecm @xmath34 while the energy densities @xmath35 and pressures @xmath36 , under the condition @xmath37 , are obtainable from @xmath38",
    "according to eq .  ( [ eq : m3 ] ) , the axion field begins to oscillate when @xmath39 . in the dual  axion model ,",
    "just as for pq , axions become massive when the chiral symmetry is broken by the formation of the @xmath40 condensate at @xmath32 . around such @xmath21 , therefore , the axion mass grows rapidly . in the dual  axion model , however , a slower growth takes place also later , because of the evolution of @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath41 is @xmath42 since @xmath43 today , the axion mass is now @xmath44ev , while , according to @xcite , at high @xmath45 @xmath46 this expression must be interpolated with eq .",

    "let us finally outline that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : o2 ] ) and ( [ eq : o3 ] ) , as well as the above interpolation , show that @xmath51 is @xmath11independent , as is required to obtain the equation of motion ( [ eq : m4 ] ) .",
    "fig.([fig : mass ] ) shows the ( low)@xmath52 dependence of @xmath50 .",

    "when @xmath2 performs many oscillations within a hubble time , then @xmath54 and @xmath55 . by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m3]),([eq : m4]),([eq : kp ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath56 when @xmath57 is given by eq  ( [ eq : o3 ] ) , @xmath58 . at @xmath59 , instead , @xmath60 . here below , the indices @xmath61 , @xmath62 will be replaced by @xmath63 .",
    "( [ eq : m7 ] ) show an energy exchange between dm and de . the former eq .",
    "( [ eq : m7 ] ) can then be integrated , yielding @xmath64 .",
    "this law holds also when @xmath65 , and then the usual behavior @xmath66 is modified , becoming @xmath67    let us now assume that the potential reads @xmath68 ( no @xmath2 dependence ) ; in the radiative era , it will then be @xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "this tracker solution holds until we approach the quark ",
    "hadron transition .",
    "then , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m4 ] ) , the de  dm coupling term , @xmath71 , exceeds @xmath72 and we enter a different tracking regime .",
    "this is shown in detail in fig.([fig : rho ] ) ,     -1.2truecm   -3.truecm    obtained for matter ( baryon ) density parameters @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and hubble constant @xmath75 ( in units of 100 km / s / mpc ) . in particular , fig .",
    "( [ fig : rho]a ) shows the transition between these tracking regimes .",
    "( [ fig : rho]b ) then shows the low@xmath52 behavior ( @xmath76 ) , since de density exceeds radiation ( @xmath77 ) and then overcomes baryons ( @xmath78 ) and dm ( @xmath79 ) . fig .",

    "in general , once the density parameter @xmath84 ( at @xmath85 ) is assigned , a model with dynamical ( coupled or uncoupled ) de is not yet univocally determined .",
    "for instance , the potential ( [ eq : l1 ] ) depends on the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath24 and one of them can still be arbitrarily fixed .",
    "other potentials show similar features .    in this model",
    "such arbitrariness no longer exists .",

    "( [ eq : l2 ] ) , allows to obtain ( i ) the scale factor @xmath91 when fluctuations start and ( ii ) the scale @xmath24 in the potential ( [ eq : l1 ] ) . to do so",
    ", the present density of dm , @xmath92 , ( or @xmath93 ) must be assigned .",
    "but , as we shall soon outline , the observational value of the density in the world forces @xmath91 to lay about the quark ",
    "hadron transition , while also @xmath24 is substantially fixed .",
    "the plots in the previous section are for @xmath94 ; then @xmath95gev and @xmath96 are required by the system .",
    "but , when @xmath93 goes from 0.2 to 0.4 , @xmath97 ( almost ) linearly runs in the narrow interval 10.0510.39@xmath90 , while @xmath91 steadily lays at the eve of the quark  hadron transition .",
    "besides of predicting fair ratios between the world components , a viable model should also allow the formation of structures in the world .",
    "the dual axion model belongs to the class of coupled de models treated by amendola @xcite , with a time ",
    "dependent coupling @xmath98 .",
    "a @xmath11@xmath99 phase therefore exists , after matter  radiation equivalence , as the kinetic energy of de is non ",
    "neglegible during the matter  dominated era .",
    "fluctuation evolution is then obtained by solving the equations in @xcite , with the above @xmath100 . the behavior shown in fig.([fig : flu ] ) ( left ) is then found .",
    "fig ( [ fig : flu ] ) ( center and right ) compare fluctuation evolutions the dual axion model ( solid curves ) , with those in an analogous @xmath24cdm model ( dot  dashed curves ) and in a coupled de model with constant coupling @xmath101 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "as shown by the plots , the overall growth , from recombination to now is similar in dual axion and @xmath24cdm models , being quite smaller than in de models with constant coupling .",
    "the differences of dual axion from @xmath24cdm are : ( i ) objects form earlier and ( ii ) baryon fluctuations keep below dm fluctuations until very recently .",
    "we shall then test the dual axion model towards cmb data , together with other dynamical or coupled de cosmologies , by using a parameter space of 7 to 8 dimensions .",

    "we aim to test whether data constrain @xmath113 into the right region , turning a generic @xmath112 model into a dual  axion model .",

    "wmap data yield constraints on @xmath113 for @xmath112 models ( see table [ tab : res3 ] ) and the 2@xmath0 @xmath24interval ranges from @xmath119 to @xmath120gev , so including the dual  axion model .",

    "all models yield similar behaviors and this is why no model category prevails .",
    "discrimination could be achieved by improving large angular scale observation , especially for polarization , so to reduce the errors on small@xmath122 harmonics .",
    "a first point worth outlining is that sugra ( uncoupled ) models , bearing precise advantages in respect to @xmath24cdm , are consistent with wmap data .",
    "the ratio @xmath123 at @xmath85 , for most these models , fulfills the constraint @xmath124 .",
    "however , these models exhibit a fast @xmath125 variation , and @xmath125 becomes @xmath126 -0.6 , -0.7 at @xmath1272 . in spite of this sharp decrease ,",
    "however , there is no conflict with data .",
    "the results shown in the previous section were also considered in the presence of some priors . for uncoupled or constant  coupling sugra models , adding priors scarsely affects conclusions .",
    "@xmath112models , instead , are to be discussed separately .    in the first two categories of models opacity ( @xmath31 )",

    "the spectral index @xmath128 is pushed to greater values . in turn , owing to the @xmath31@xmath105 degeneracy , this is compensated by increasing @xmath31 .",

    ". we shall consider the effect of a prior also on @xmath104 .",
    "the prior on @xmath129 affects reionization and the spectral slope : @xmath31 and @xmath128 are lowered to match wmap s findings .",
    "the prior on @xmath104 , in the absence of coupling , favors low@xmath113 models , closer to @xmath24cdm .",
    "quite in general , in fact , the sound horizon at decoupling is unaffected by the energy scale @xmath24 , while the distance of the last  scattering  band is smaller for greater @xmath113 s .",
    "then , as @xmath113 increases , a lower @xmath104 is favored to match the position of the first peak . in the presence of coupling , there is a simultaneous effect on @xmath110 : greater @xmath110 s yield a smaller sound horizon at recombination , so that the distribution on @xmath104 is smoother .",
    "@xmath112 models exhibit rather different features .",
    "parameters are more strongly constrained in this case , as already outlined for the scale @xmath24 .",
    "the main puzzling feature of @xmath112 models is that large @xmath104 is favored : the best ",
    "fit 2@xmath0 interval does not extend below 0.85@xmath90 .",
    "the problem is more severe for dual ",
    "axion @xmath113 s values , whose preferred values are well within 2@xmath0 .",
    "this model naturally tends to displace the first @xmath121 peak to greater @xmath122 ( smaller angular scales ) as coupling does in any case does .",
    "the model , however , has no extra coupling parameter and the intensity of coupling is controlled by the scale @xmath24 .",
    "increasing this scale requires a more effective compensation and still greater values of @xmath104 are favored .",
    "this effect appears however related to the choice of sugra potentials , which is just meant to provide a concrete framework for the dual axion model . to deepen its analysis , the contribution to the axion abundance due to the decay of possible topological defects",
    "should also be discussed .",
    "a previous analysis of wmap limits on constant coupling models had been carried on by @xcite . their analysis concerned potentials @xmath131 fulfilling the relation @xmath132 , with suitable @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "they also assumed that @xmath135 .",
    "our analysis deals with a different potential and allows more general parameter variations .",
    "the constraints on @xmath110 we find are less severe . it must be however outlined that @xmath1360.2 is forbidden by a non  linear analysis of structure formation @xcite .",
    "the first evidences of dm date some 70 years ago , although only in the late seventies limits on cmb anisotropies made evident that a non  baryonic component had to be dominant . de could also be dated back to einstein s _ cosmological constant _ , although only snia data revived it , soon followed by data on cmb and deep galaxy samples .",
    "axions have been a good candidate for dm since the late seventies , although various studies , as well as the occurrence of the sn 1987a , strongly constrained the pq scale around values @xmath137gev .",
    "contributions to dm from topological singularities ( cosmic string and walls ) narrowed the constraints to @xmath20 .",
    "full agreement on the relevance of such contributions has not yet been attained and , in this paper , they are still disregarded , while they could cause shifts in our quantitative predictions .",
    "this point must be therefore deepened in further work .",
    "the fact that dm and de can both arise from scalar fields , just by changing the power of the field in effective potentials , already stimulated the work of various authors .",
    "a potential like ( [ eq : l1 ] ) was considered in the so  called _ spintessence _ model @xcite . according to the choice of parameters ,",
    "@xmath22 was shown to behave either as dm or as de .",
    "padmanabhan & choudhury @xcite , instead , built a tachionic model where dm and de arise from a single scalar field .    here , the scalar field @xmath22 , accounting for _ both _ de and dm , arises in the solution of the strong@xmath1 problem : as in the pq model , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n1 ] ) @xmath2 is turned into a dynamical variable , the phase of @xmath22 . here",
