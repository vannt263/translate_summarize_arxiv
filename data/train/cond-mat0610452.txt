    "doped mott insulators is one of possible candidates of superconductors with electron - electron correlation . at a rational",
    "filling , strong electron - electron interaction makes electrons localized in real space .",
    "this is the mott insulator where charge excitations are gapped . even at this rational filling ,",
    "the spin degree of freedom survives as a gapless mode where quantum objects as collection of the @xmath0 spins form a singlet ground state .    when mobile carriers are introduced into the mott insulator , we may expect that the charge gap is destroyed which realizes the superconducting ground state driven by the electron interaction . in the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) picture proposed by anderson to describe high-@xmath1 superconducting cuplates@xcite , doped holes itinerate in a spin - singlet ground state and condense into a superconducting state .",
    "if there is no doped hole , i.e. , half - filled case , the spin - singlet ground state is expected as a mott insulator .",
    "apart from real doping , that is , changing chemical potential , there can be several possibilities for the effective carrier doping .",
    "one of a natural possibility can be geometrical frustration in layered organic superconductors , which is approximated by a half - filled hubbard model with next - nearest - neighbor hopping@xcite .",
    "another one is gossamer superconductivity by laughlin @xcite . even at the half - filed case",
    ", finite double occupancy may destroy the mott insulator at a small on - site coulomb repulsion and lead the ground state to the gossamer superconducting state@xcite .",
    "this theory has been also applied to organic superconductors@xcite .",
    "the gossamer superconducting state is realized not as a ground state of strongly correlated system but a variational function based on a bardeen cooper schrieffer ( bcs ) superconducting state .",
    "however , it can be an exact ground state of the model hamiltonian @xcite which violates the charge conservation as the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "it is thus theoretically interesting to consider @xmath2 symmetry breaking generically .",
    "let us recall the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "the bcs hamiltonian with quadratic terms @xmath3 has been widely accepted as a theoretical model for superconductors , where @xmath4 is a mean field of pair annihilation amplitude @xmath5 and @xmath6 are annihilation operators of fermion .",
    "the mean field violates the @xmath7 gauge symmetry , i.e. , the total particle number is not preserved but fluctuating .",
    "this charge fluctuation turns out to diverge in the thermodynamic limit@xcite .",
    "the most simple candidate of @xmath2 symmetry breaking terms is @xmath8 , which implies injection of electrons and holes from out of the system .",
    "the concept of this term is directly connected to local charge fluctuation or doping .",
    "although the previous study is limited to free fermion , such a 1d system defined as @xmath9 has been studied and was solved with a jordan - wigner transformation@xcite and with a canonical transformation@xcite . to clarify the meaning of @xmath10 ,",
    "let us describe the procedure of ref.@xcite in detail ; this spinless fermion chain can be mapped to semi - infinite @xmath11 model with a local magnetic field at the boundary .",
    "this local magnetic field in the @xmath12 plane turns out to be @xmath10 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath10 terms were introduced in different contexts .",
    "it is a common concept that the hamiltonian is an effective one after tracing out of some environment .",
    "there are two motivations of the present work .",
    "the first is to clarify the properties of strongly correlated systems with nonuniform charge fluctuation .",
    "especially , a particle - hole symmetric hubbard model with @xmath10 will make it possible to realize the ground state which is a linear combination of half - filled mott insulating state with electron - doped and hole - doped states , which evokes the gossamer theory .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate fluctuation of total particle number as a direct effect of the @xmath2 symmetry breaking .",
    "the other is to test a mean - field type approach for the interchain hopping of fermion chains .",
    "when we consider a decoupling of interchain hopping @xmath13 into @xmath14 with the mean - field type approximation , the effective fields @xmath15 can be identified as @xmath16 .. ] in this approach , the hamiltonian is considered as an effective one obtained after tracing out neighboring chains in the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) systems .",
    "since the hubbard model has coulomb interaction , we adopt the density matrix renormalized group ( dmrg ) method , which is one of powerful numerical methods for 1d quantum systems@xcite .",
    "the dmrg method has achieved high precision in various 1d systems while application to two - dimensional lattice is considered to be difficult . as an application to higher dimensions",
    ", we note that the dmrg method has already applied to quasi-1d spin systems with interchain couplings as mean fields in the manner of ref.@xcite .",
    "this paper may be first attempt to quasi-1d fermionic systems with interchain hopping as mean fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : model ] we construct a hamiltonian with a generalized @xmath2 breaking term and mention a `` bath '' site introduced by the canonical transformation@xcite . in  [ sec : method ] , we describe an application of the dmrg method to the hamiltonian which does not conserve particle number . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we demonstrate the mean - field type approach for quasi-1d strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "finally we conclude the results and discuss problems of the mean - field type approach . in appendix , the note for the canonical transformation is summarized .",
    "let us define a hamiltonian with the generalized symmetry breaking term term @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 can be one of the hamiltonians for correlated electrons systems .",
    "in this paper we will restrict @xmath20 to the hubbard model defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 are fermion operators and @xmath23 is the system size . the symmetry breaking term @xmath18",
    "is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath15 are considered as external fields at this stage .",
    "this model with nonzero @xmath15 breaks the particle number conservation because @xmath18 is not commutable with the total number of particles : @xmath25\\neq 0,$ ] where @xmath26 .",
    "this comes from the fact that @xmath18 breaks the @xmath2 symmetry , where the global @xmath2 rotation defined as @xmath27 .",
    "generally , external fields break some symmetry as magnetic fields break spin rotational symmetry .",
    "in addition to the @xmath2 symmetry - breaking , @xmath18 also breaks the @xmath28 spin - rotational symmetry , while the hubbard model without magnetic field is an @xmath28 invariant .",
    "the global @xmath28 rotation is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the symmetry breaking term transforms under the @xmath32 rotation as @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the symmetry is recovered only if @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath20 satisfies the particle - hole symmetry , i.e. , @xmath20 is invariant under the usual particle - hole transformation on the tight - binding model : @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , @xmath20 is commute with a anti - unitary operator @xmath38@xcite , defined as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a complex conjugation and @xmath41 is the unitary operator defined as @xmath42 .",
    "it satisfies @xmath43 and one can show @xmath44 where @xmath45 can be complex here and will be fixed @xmath46 as the unit of energy in numerical calculations .",
    "the symmetry - breaking term @xmath18 with @xmath47 is also invariant under the particle - hole transformation .",
    "then , one can construct a hamiltonian @xmath48 which preserves the particle - hole symmetry but breaks @xmath2 and @xmath28 symmetries .",
    "it is easy to show total number of electrons of this hamiltonian is half filled when the ground state is unique .",
    "the proof is following : because of the particle - hole symmetry @xmath49 , @xmath50 is also the ground state : @xmath51 . since the ground state is unique , @xmath52 is equal to @xmath50 except for a phase factor",
    ". then one gets @xmath53 and @xmath54 satisfies @xmath55 from eqs.([eq : n ] ) and ( [ eq : n2 ] ) , it is deduced that total number of electrons is half filled , @xmath56 .",
    "it might be interesting to remind the reader that the half - filled hamiltonian with the @xmath2 symmetry breaking term has some analogy to a finite double occupancy in the half - filled case discussed in the gossamer superconducting theory proposed by laughlin@xcite .      to handle the fermion sign especially by the dmrg which will be discussed in the next section ,",
    "let us consider a following extension of the hilbert space by the canonical transformation @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is additional annihilation operator of a spinless fermion and satisfies @xmath59 canonicality of this transformation can be easily shown as @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , when we denote the fermion operators in @xmath20 as @xmath62 , @xmath20 is invariant under this canonical transformation : @xmath63 because @xmath20 is made of invariant operators like @xmath64 .",
    "the term @xmath65 , however , is modified as below , @xmath66 this formula implies that @xmath58 site is a `` environment bath '' site in the spirit of the dynamical mean field theory(dmft)@xcite .",
    "since single fermion operators in @xmath67 become bilinear , @xmath68 conserves a even - odd parity of the total particle number defined below .",
    "the operator of the total particle number @xmath54 is invariant under the transformation , i.e. , @xmath69 .",

    "the parity operator of @xmath73 is defined as @xmath75 and satisfies @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "one can show the even - odd parity of @xmath73 is conserved , i.e. , @xmath78=0 .",

    "[ sec : ap : ct ] , one can show that expectation value of an arbitrary operator @xmath87 can be written as @xmath88 .",
    "this means that any expectation value for the system @xmath67 can be obtained in the system @xmath68 .",
    "to study the present 1d strongly correlated system without conservation of the total particle number , the dmrg method is used . as we implied in the previous section",
    ", the conservation of even - odd parity of particle number is required to calculate the fermion sign in the dmrg algorithm . in this section",
    "we will illustrate detail of the dmrg algorithm and mention the fermion sign .",
    "we note that the dmrg method has been applied to the different model which does not conserve total number of particles but conserves it s parity , called the bcs pairing hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "first of all , we describe the iterative procedure of the dmrg for the hamiltonian @xmath68 with @xmath58 site .",
    "figure [ fig : d ] illustrates systems in first iterative procedure with enlarging the system size from @xmath89 to @xmath90 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : d](b ) , the hopping terms between @xmath58 site and each sites in @xmath91 become long range in the successive elongation . generally speaking ,",
    "long - range hopping terms such as @xmath92 enlarge a numerical error but the numerical error is reduced because the @xmath58 site is not renormalized in the iterative procedure .",
    "next , to calculate the fermionic system , one should take care of the fermion sign@xcite .",
    "when the two local operators @xmath93 are represented in bases @xmath94 , one can usually get it s product @xmath95 , where the coefficient @xmath96 is the fermion sign .",
    "this formula is valid if the states , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , have a fixed even - odd parity of particle number and operators @xmath93 conserve the even - odd parity .",
    "otherwise , states or operators are modified .",
    "for example such states as @xmath99 may change to @xmath100 when the states get the fermion sign .",
    "this change is hard to followed in the dmrg procedure .",
    "this is the reason why conservation of even - odd parity is required by the dmrg .",
    "the canonical transformation makes it possible to calculate the fermion sign because all operators conserve the even - odd parity as shown in eq.([eq : poao ] ) in appendix .",
    "[ sec : ap : ct ] .",
    "moreover , local bases , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , have fixed parity as illustrated below .    then , all local bases in each steps should have fixed even - odd parity of particle number .",
    "we explain this with one step of the iterative procedure below .    1 .",
    "here we suppose local bases have fixed parity of particle number as in @xmath89 system .",
    "2 .   make the matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xmath68 from local operators represented by local bases , taking care of the fermion sign .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath68 is block diagonalized and has even and odd parity sector .",
    "3 .   calculate the ground states @xmath103 and it s energy @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is even - odd parity of particle number .",
    "4 .   make the matrix elements of four density matrices @xmath106 ; @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "one can show that these density matrices are block diagonalized into even and odd parity sector , i.e. , @xmath109=0 $ ] , as the hamiltonian is .",
    "we note that if the hamiltonian conserves particle number , @xmath110=0 $ ] , the density matrices for the left and right block conserve particle number , @xmath111=0 $ ] .",
    "diagonalize @xmath106 and select the lowest @xmath112 eigenvalues and their eigenvectors called renormalized bases , which have fixed parity of particle number because @xmath106 conserve the parity . 6 .",
    "remake matrix elements of all local operators in the renormalized bases .",
    "then , renormalized bases are the next local bases and satisfy the supposition in the step 1 .",
    "as described in the procedure , since @xmath68 conserves even - odd parity , one can show that each local base in each steps has fixed parity of particle number .",
    "that is , one can calculate the fermion sign .",
    "finally , we note that the number of the states of left and right block is used up to about 60 and the truncation error is less than @xmath113 in the following results .",
    "since we deal with general @xmath15 which depends on the site , the dmrg method for the random system@xcite is employed .",
    "the expectation value is deduced as @xmath114 in order to avoid the numerical error .",
    "in the following , we will show results of a total - charge fluctuation and a particle number in  [ sec : totalcharge ] , which are the direct effect of existence of external fields @xmath15 . in  [ sec : interchaincouplings ] we will show tentative demonstration of the mean - field theory to deal with the interchain hopping .",
    "we note that we restrict the system size @xmath23 to even to obtain the unique ground state @xmath115 for @xmath67 . in the dmrg calculation , @xmath68 is used and the ground states @xmath85 for @xmath68 is doubly degenerated .",
    "this degeneracy is artificial due to the canonical transformation .      when the hamiltonian @xmath20 is commutable with @xmath116 , the ground state for @xmath20 has a fixed number of electrons and the total - charge fluctuation , @xmath117 , is zero when the ground state is unique . on the other hand , since external fields @xmath15 breaks the @xmath7 symmetry , the total - charge fluctuation becomes finite .",
    "the ground state for nonzero @xmath15 becomes a linear combination of electron - doped states and hole - doped states .",
    "it implies , even at half - filling , `` effective carriers '' are introduced by the nonzero @xmath15 .",
    "since large charge gap prefers no fluctuation , when the coulomb interaction @xmath118 becomes infinite , doped states are not allowed at half - filling and @xmath119 becomes zero .    in fig.[fig:1",
    "] , total charge fluctuation @xmath119 as a function of @xmath120 is plotted as an example of the particle - hole symmetric @xmath15 .",
    "infinite @xmath118 gives no fluctuation @xmath121 and finite total - charge fluctuation is proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "this figure is only for the small system and relatively large @xmath15 but the qualitative character that @xmath119 is proportional to @xmath120 is general .",
    "it should be noted that maximum of total - charge fluctuation @xmath119 is order 1 as fig.[fig:1 ] shows @xmath122 in large @xmath120 region .",
    "that is , the present model can not reproduce the bcs ground state with @xmath123 .",
    "this is important for the charge compressibility defined as @xmath124 .",
    "let us summarize this property for the mott insulator and the metal : in the mott insulating state , the charge compressibility diverges at @xmath125 and @xmath126 at @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the charge gap@xcite . in the metallic case ,",
    "the charge compressibility is proportional to the density of states at the fermi energy . in non - zero @xmath15 case",
    ", the charge compressibility at half - filling becomes finite but is expected to become zero at @xmath129 in the limit @xmath130 because the magnitude of @xmath119 is order @xmath131 .      in this subsection ,",
    "let us consider the interchain hopping of 1d mott insulators .",
    "when we take an ansatz of the mean field type , external fields @xmath15 can be determined self - consistently as @xmath132 .",
    "we adopt the self - consistent equation : @xmath133 although the interchain hopping also gives rise to the effect of the band structure and the dimensionality , the effect of the band structure is not taken into account in this approach .",
    "the meaning of @xmath134 in the self - consistent equation is the strength of charge fluctuation in the perpendicular direction with the general band structure .    in the dmrg method we used the transformed hamiltonian , @xmath135 , and the transformed self - consistent equation as @xmath136 .",
    "we note that @xmath15 is limited to real number for simplicity .    in fig.[fig:4 ]",
    "some result of converged @xmath15 after the self - consistent loop for @xmath137 are plotted .",
    "@xmath15 converged smaller value as @xmath118 increased , which implies a quantum phase transition from nonzero @xmath15 to zero @xmath15 .    to clarify the transition",
    ", one can define the stabilization energy @xmath138 , which means the energy gain due to charge fluctuation in the perpendicular direction , where @xmath139 is the ground state energy with converged @xmath15 .",
    "there are two simple limits : infinite @xmath118 limit and small @xmath140 limit . in both case @xmath15 converged to about zero and the 1d mott insulator is realized .    in fig.[fig:2 ]",
    "the stabilization energy is plotted as a function of @xmath140 .",
    "increasing @xmath140 means that length between chains is changing more closely , which corresponds to applying pressure . in small @xmath140 region , @xmath141 becomes zero , which is identified as the 1d mott insulator phase .",
    "actually , converged @xmath15 and @xmath119 are zero there .",
    "there is a transition from the 1d mott insulator phase to the symmetry breaking phase as @xmath140 increase .",
    "extrapolated points in fig.[fig:2 ] show that the transition point @xmath142 is about @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "since the charge gap of mott chain of @xmath144 is @xmath145@xcite , the naive criterion @xmath146@xcite is reasonable in this analysis .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the symmetry breaking of @xmath2 charge and @xmath28 spin due to external fields @xmath15 , which lead to nonzero total - charge fluctuation @xmath119 .",
    "finite @xmath147 means the coherent ground state is a linear combination of electron - doped states and hole doped states .",
    "we have applied the dmrg method to the particle - hole symmetric hubbard chain with @xmath15 and have actually demonstrated that the total - charge fluctuation @xmath119 at zero - temperature is linear with respect to @xmath120 even at half - filled case @xmath148 .    considering @xmath15 as a mean field of interchain - hopping tentatively ,",
    "we have obtained the quantum phase transition from the 1d mott insulator to the symmetry breaking phase as @xmath140 increases , i.e. , pressure increases .",
    "the transition point @xmath149 in fig.[fig:2 ] is close to the charge gap @xmath128 . in the symmetry",
    "breaking phase , effectively doped carriers itinerate between chains because of non - zero @xmath15 .",
    "since the difference between two phases is whether the interchain hopping becomes relevant or not , one may say this transition deconfinement transition@xcite .",
    "however , since this approach is limited to small @xmath15 , clarification of the symmetry breaking phase is remained as future work .",
    "the clarification is interesting work because it is well known that destroying the mott phase by applying the pressure , i.e. , increasing @xmath140 , is typical for high-@xmath1 cuprates .    as described in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , the magnitude of @xmath119 as a function of the system size is constant while the bcs theory gives @xmath150 .",
    "this property may be related to the fact that we dropped the anti - commutation relation between @xmath15 and fermion operators in the hamiltonian .",
    "that is , expectation value @xmath151 was a fermionic operator before taking the average as a mean - field . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this fact gives the limitation of this `` mean field '' approach .",
    "we can find the another way to bosonize the mean field and this result will be reported in future work .",
    "as a technical outlook , we have used only the infinite method of the dmrg in the self - consistent calculation .",
