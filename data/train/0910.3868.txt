    "motivated by the question whether the time evolution of interacting quantum systems can be efficiently simulated with the help of matrix - product decompositions of the many - body wave function @xcite or corresponding analogues in higher dimensions nishino1998,verstraete2004c , murg2007,vidal2007a , verstraete2008,sierra1998 , the dynamics of entanglement in quantum lattice models has become an important research area in quantum physics .",
    "a convenient measure of entanglement are schuch2008a the von neumann and rnyi entropies .",
    "it was shown in bravyi2006 and @xcite that the von neumann entropy of a subsystem which starts in an initially separable state has an upper bound that grows linear in time .",
    "the linear growth of the entropy , as observed by calabrese and co - workers @xcite , which corresponds to an exponential growth of the effective bond dimension of matrix  product states ( mps ) represents a severe limitation for the simulability of the unitary time evolution of quantum many - body systems . in the present note",
    "we derive an upper bound to the bipartite entanglement that also holds for short times .",
    "in particular we consider the purity of the reduced density matrix of one of the partitions .",
    "general quantum mechanical arguments suggest that the purity can not decease exponentially for short times as implied by the linear entanglement bound @xcite , but rather quadratically . here",
    "we derive a quadratic lower bound for the purity .",
    "this finding which is the main result of our paper has practical relevance for the numerical simulation of another class of dynamical problems that gained a lot of interest recently where the time evolution is non - unitary due to a coupling to external reservoirs syassen2008,durr2009,garcia - ripoll2009,prosen2008,prosen2008a , prosen2009,diehl2008,daley2009,han2009,kantian2009,kiffner2009 .",
    "the non - unitary liouvillian dynamics of the system density matrix is equivalent to a time evolution of the many - body wave function with a complex hamiltonian and with a stochastic sequence of projections , called quantum jumps @xcite .",
    "if the frequency of such projections is sufficiently large they can prevent the growth of entanglement within the system by a mechanism similar to the well - known quantum zeno effect @xcite . as a result of this the time evolution of open system",
    "may be simulated using an adaptive mps expansion as e.g. within the time evolving block decimation algorithm ( tebd ) vidal2003,vidal2004 for longer times .",
    "the critical frequency of such a zeno effect for entanglement is determined by the coefficient of the quadratic term in the short time expansion of the purity .",
    "note that this effect would be absent for an exponential time dependence of the purity . for larger times",
    "we derive an exponential lower bound corresponding to the well - known linear  in  time bound of the entanglement entropy lieb1972,bravyi2006,eisert2006 .",
    "although this result follows directly from the latter entropy bound , we derive it here in a few lines without making use of the somewhat more involved proof of the linear entropy scaling . to illustrate the validity of our findings we discuss as an example the 1d spin-@xmath2 xx and xxz models , where we calculate the time evolution of the purity using the numerical time - evolving block decimation algorithm vidal2003,vidal2004 , as well as two coupled spin chains , which allow us to illustrate the scaling with the boundary size .",
    "we here consider a lattice model with a bipartition into parts @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are , say , compact sets of lattice sites .",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian of the total systems can be written as @xmath5where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the parts of the hamiltonian acting on lattice sites inside the respective partitions .",
    "the last sum describes the interaction between the two parts an extends over all bonds , labeled by the index @xmath8 , that connect sites from both partitions .",
    "we assume an interaction that has strict finite range .",
    "in this case the total number of bonds scales with the size @xmath9 of the surface separating the two partitions .",
    "any pure state of the total system can be decomposed as @xmath10where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are orthonormal sets of states of the subsystems , @xmath13 are the schmidt coefficients , and @xmath14 is at most the dimension of the hilbert space of the smaller subsystem . as @xmath15 is normalized , @xmath16 .",

    "\\label{eq : arbitinitialcondition}\\end{aligned}\\]]if @xmath57 , i.e. if the subsystems are uncorrelated in the beginning , the upper bound is trivial .",
    "the lower bound reduces to @xmath58we note that the lower bound becomes zero at @xmath59 i.e. it reduces to the trivial one .",
    "the lower bound can be slightly improved , if we know the maximum schmidt rank @xmath60 of the bipartite decomposition that can arise along the evolution .",
    "one finds @xmath61 evidently @xmath62 as it should be .",
    "typically @xmath63 and thus the second term in eq.(eq : final-2 ) is small .",
    "in the general case , @xmath60 can be the dimension of the smaller hilbert space .",
    "so one must assume this , if there is no better bound known a priori . in certain special cases as for the 1d quantum ising model with an initial state that factorizes in all sites , @xmath64 , and the lower",
    "bound ( [ eq : final-2 ] ) becomes exact , see below .",
    "the estimation ( [ eq : final-2 ] ) follows from the inequality    @xmath65 \\label{inequality}%\\ ] ]    which can be proven by the method of lagrange multipliers .",

    "( eq : final-2 ) , provide an estimate for the purity for short times . as expected from general quantum mechanical arguments the lower bound of the purity decreases quadratically in time following @xmath66 .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath67 that defines the range of validity of the quadratic time scaling is inverse proportional to the eigenvalue spread @xmath52 and scales linearly with the size of the surface @xmath9 separating the subsystems and thus has an area - law behavior . in order to test the scaling of the lower bound with the boundary size of the system we consider next a pair of linear spin chains subject to an ising interaction @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the pauli operators of the two chains respectively .",
    "if the initial state is @xmath71 i.e. where all spins in chain @xmath3 are in the eigenstate of @xmath72 , resp .",
    "@xmath73 , with spin down and all spins in chain @xmath4 in the corresponding spin up state , the purity is given by @xmath74 this can be seen easily , as for the initial product state the total purity can be represented as @xmath75 because each spin pair of the coupled chains has a purity equal to @xmath76 .",
    "we thus see , that the characteristic time @xmath67 scales as @xmath77 for this choice of the initial state .",

    "@xmath81 , one finds @xmath82 as can be shown by simple algebraic calculations .",
    "we see that ( purityentangl ) coincides with our estimation ( [ eq : final-2 ] ) since @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in other words ,",
    "our estimate is a tight lower bound for the purity . in this case",
    "the system size scaling of the characteristic time is @xmath9 .    note , that in the special case of an ising hamiltonian , our two - chains example in fact represents also higher dimensional ising lattices of arbitrary size .",
    "since all summands in the ising hamiltonian , say on a hyper - cubic lattice commute , they can be absorbed in the quantum states of the subsystems @xmath3 an @xmath4 .",
    "they play no role for the entanglement , which is only created by the terms directly coupling @xmath3 and @xmath4 . but those can always be written in the form ( [ eq : isingsigmatau ] ) , no matter what the spacial dimension of the surface is .    for short times , the quadratic estimate ( [ eq : final ] )",
    "is much better than any exponential one ( [ eq : largelimeestimation ] ) ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore it is of fundamental importance .",
    "it shows e.g. that a sequence of frequent projections of the system onto non - entangled states ( i.e. no entanglement within the system ) at a rate larger than @xmath52 will prevent the build - up of such an entanglement in full analogy to the quantum zeno effect facchio2001a .",
    "the long time behavior of the purity can be obtained from the known upper linear - in - time bound of the entropy @xcite .",
    "indeed , by using the convexity of @xmath85 we immediately get @xmath86 we thus have @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 being positive constants .    in the following",
    "we show that ( [ eq : entropy - bound ] ) can also be obtained in a simple way from our approach without the necessity to invoke the rather involved proof of the linear - in - time - bound of the entropy .    in order to find a suitable estimate for the long - time behavior of the purity one has to find a different way to bound the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : purity ] ) .",

    "we first consider the spin-@xmath2 xx ",
    "model @xmath100 for this model the constants which enter our estimates take on the values @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we look at a chain of @xmath103 spins and in order to maximize the dimension of the subsystems we choose an equal partition with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) being the left ( right ) half chain .",
    "the initial state of the system is taken to be a product state , specifically the anti - ferromagnetic state @xmath104 we choose this particular initial state in order to have a large maximum entropy since @xmath105 corresponds to half filling , so the dimension of the hilbert space accessible with respect to the present conservation of the total z  magnetization is maximized .",
    "the purity is initially @xmath106 .",
    "fig shows the evolution of the purity over time .",
    "the red , straight , thick line is the numerical results from our simulation using the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) method @xcite .",
    "this results can be considered numerically exact as discussed below .",
    "the solid , black , thinner lines show the bounds ( [ eq : final ] ) .",
    "the one starting at @xmath107 indicates that our bound is optimal up to second order for times short compared to the inverse coupling between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , if we start initially from a pure state .",
    "however when starting from an initially entangled state , we can only expect to get agreement up to zeroth order from ( eq : arbitinitialcondition ) , as illustrated by the black , solid , thinner lines starting at @xmath108 and @xmath109 . while the exponential lower bound ( eq : largelimeestimation ) , plotted in the dashed line , is bad for short times , it has the property of remaining finite for all times in contrast to ( [ eq : final ] ) .",
    "so one can smoothly concatenate the two bounds at time @xmath110 assuming we started with a pure state at @xmath107 .",
    "this combined bound is superior to both the quadratic short - time and exponential long - time estimates and is shown as a green , dot - dashed line .",

    "model @xmath111 choosing the anisotropy @xmath112 to be @xmath113 .",
    "this again yields a constant of @xmath114 for the short time behavior .",
    "but while the exponential bound increases to @xmath115 and one could expect a faster decay of the purity due to the fact that this system can not be mapped to free fermions , the true curves are very much alike for both systems , see fig .",

    "[ fig ] ) for comparison . ]    the numerical calculation was done using a matrix dimension of @xmath117 , a time - step width of @xmath118 in a fourth order trotter decomposition , and exploiting the conservation of the total magnetization explicitly .",
    "although the dimension of the subsystems is adaptively truncated to @xmath119 , this can not introduce error on the timescale plotted , since the purity remains well above the minimal value of @xmath120 representable using matrix product states .",

    "ising - type couplings inside the chains where also taken into account , but do not contribute to the entanglement between the two chains .",
    "while for simple product states between the sites , one can expect a scaling of @xmath123 ( dashed line ) , we know from ( [ purityentangl ] ) , that there are in fact initial states , that contain sufficient entanglement along the boundary , to give@xmath124 , i. e. , where ( [ eq : final ] ) is tight .",
    "the different symbols correspond to different initial states , the evolution of which was calculated via an exact diagonalization .",

    "also shown are other states like the w - type states @xmath126 , where @xmath127    , such that the quadratic order in ( [ eq : final ] ) and ( [ totalpurity ] ) suffices to describe the result . while the ghz - like initial states show the fastest increase of entanglement ( @xmath128 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) , straight line ) , and the product like ones stick to the moderate @xmath129 ( eq . ( [ totalpurity ] ) , dashed line ) , w - type states show an intermediate behavior . ]",
    "in summary we derived an upper bound for the time evolution of the bipartite entanglement in quantum lattice models in terms of a lower bound to the subsystem purity .",
    "as one would expect from general quantum mechanical considerations the purity decreases for short times quadratically in time . the corresponding characteristic time was shown to be limited by the spread of the eigenvalues of the part of the hamiltonian that accounts for the interaction between the partitions .",
    "the latter scales linear with the size of the surface separating the two partitions and thus the entanglement follows an area - law behavior . for larger times",
    "we derived a lower bound of the purity that decrease exponentially in time .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the known linear increase of the entanglement entropy in the long - time limit .",
    "the existence of a quadratic short - time bound means that a sufficiently frequent sequence of projections to non - entangled states , as for example due to a dissipative process , can prevent the build - up of entanglement within the lattice system .",
