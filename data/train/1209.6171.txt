    "the theory of matrices with random entries , originally devised as a tool to understand and predict the spectra of heavy nuclei for which a detailed account of the interactions between particles is too complicated , has seen a spectacular resurgence of interest in recent years , with a number of unexpected and often surprising applications ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "while wigner and dyson are usually regarded as the pioneers in the field , john wishart had already introduced random matrices in 1928 in his studies of multivariate populations @xcite .",
    "the wigner - dyson ( gaussian ) and wishart ensembles ( together with a few others ) lie at the core of the _ classical _ world of invariant matrices , characterized by the following main features :    1 .",
    "the joint probability distribution ( jpd ) of matrix entries , collectively denoted by @xmath10 $ ] , remains unaltered if one performs a similarity transformation @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being orthogonal ( real symmetric @xmath13 ) , unitary ( complex hermitian @xmath13 ) or symplectic ( quaternion self - dual @xmath13 ) matrix . as a consequence ,",
    "the eigenvectors of such matrices are haar ( uniform ) distributed in their respective groups . 2 .",
    "the joint distribution of the @xmath14 real eigenvalues @xmath15 can be generically written in the gibbs - boltzmann form , + @xmath16 + with the hamiltonian @xmath17 given by : + @xmath18 + where @xmath19 a confining potential that depends on the precise form of the joint distribution of matrix entries @xmath10 $ ] . for example , if the entries of @xmath13 are independent , the only allowed potential is quadratic @xmath20 , which correspond to the gaussian ensembles . if correlations among the entries are allowed , then different potentials ( all corresponding to rotationally invariant weights ) are possible .",
    "for example , in the wishart case , @xmath21 for @xmath22 ( so that all the eigenvalues are non - negative ) and @xmath23 for @xmath24 . + the normalization constant @xmath25 is called the partition function and is simply given by the multiple integral + @xmath26 + from , one easily deduces that the system of @xmath14 eigenvalues of a classically invariant ensemble behaves as a thermodynamic system of charged particles arranged on the real line , in equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath0 under competing interactions ( the confining potential @xmath19 and the logarithmic all - to - all repulsion term ) in .",
    "in contrast with the usual canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics , however , the so - called dyson index @xmath0 is quantized and can only assume the values @xmath27 for real symmetric , complex hermitian and quaternion self - dual matrices respectively .",
    "lifting the quantization of @xmath0 ( dyson s _ threefold way _ ) has been a major theoretical challenge in view of possible applications e.g. to the quantum hall effect .",
    "dumitriu and edelman @xcite were eventually able to construct ensembles of tridiagonal matrices with independent entries whose eigenvalues are distributed as with general @xmath28 .",
    "their ensemble is however _ not _ invariant under similarity transformations , and the eigenvectors are not haar distributed in the appropriate symmetry group .",
    "after an earlier attempt in the case of @xmath29 matrices @xcite , the explicit construction of an ensemble of @xmath30 matrices displaying at once rotational invariance and a continuous @xmath0 was put forward in @xcite for the gaussian ensemble .",
    "it was further shown in @xcite that only by letting the dyson index @xmath0 of that ensemble scale with the matrix size @xmath14 in an appropriate way ( namely @xmath31 ) one obtains a continuous family of deformed spectral densities parametrized by @xmath4 , interpolating between wigner s semicircle ( typical for @xmath32 invariant ensembles ) and a gaussian law ( properly describing the non - interacting limit @xmath33 ) .",
    "this result can be established in two alternative ways :    1 .   starting from the stationary joint distribution of eigenvalues ( eq . ) , setting @xmath31 , and then finding the average density of eigenvalues @xmath34 . in the limit of large @xmath14",
    ", this average density can be obtained by a saddle point analysis of the partition function eq . in a standard way .",
    "usually , when @xmath35 , only the energy term @xmath36 dominates and the entropy term @xmath37 is subleading .",
    "however , when @xmath38 , _ both _ the energy and the entropy terms are of the same order ( @xmath39 ) , which leads to a nontrivial modification of the density .",
    "the complicated nonlinear singular integro - differential equation for the saddle density , reduces very nicely to a riccati equation for the stieltjes transform of the density , which can then subsequently solved exactly .",
    "finally one obtains the density by taking imaginary part of the stieltjes transform ( see section [ subsection_saddle_p_meth ] for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "starting from the dynamical equation of motion of the eigenvalues , one first derives directly the equation of motion of the stieltjes transform of the density via it s calculus , finds the stationary solution and then obtains the average density by taking the imaginary part of the stieltjes transform ( see detailed discussion in section [ subsection_ito_m ] ) .",
    "+ in section [ subsection_saddle_p_meth ] and [ subsection_ito_m ] , in the context of our model , we show that both methods lead to the same solution .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "we first explicitly construct a random matrix model @xmath40 which is invariant under similarity transformations ( and thus has haar distributed eigenvectors ) , and @xmath41 whose jpd of eigenvalues is exactly given by the @xmath0-wishart ensemble of random matrices with a continuous @xmath28 .",
    "then , letting the dyson index @xmath0 of the ensemble scale inversely with the size of the matrix , we analytically derive the density of states for this crossover model , written in terms of the whittaker hypergeometric function ( see eq . ) , and we show that it continuously interpolates between the marenko - pastur law and a certain type of gamma distribution ( see subsection [ subcrossoversaddle ] ) . some other types of deformations of the marenko - pastur distribution for wishart - like matrix models were reported in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , keeping the dyson index @xmath0 unscaled ( i.e. it remains of @xmath42 for large matrix size @xmath14 ) but nevertheless continuous ( @xmath43 ) , we analyze the full stieltjes transform equation and we can compute the @xmath44 correction to the marenko - pastur asymptotic density for the @xmath0-wishart ensemble for all values of @xmath43 . furthermore , using results obtained by pastur and lytova in @xcite on the noise in the marenko - pastur law , we are also able to derive the @xmath45 correction term in the particular cases @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    the rest of the paper is outlined as follows . in section [ sec : wishart ]",
    "we introduce the main features of the classical wishart ensemble along with the evolution law for the eigenvalue process . in section [ diff_mat_beta ]",
    ", we construct a @xmath48-parameters matrix model ( and the respective evolution law for the eigenvalues ) that at large times interpolates between the wishart ensemble and so - called cir processes whose stationary pdf is a certain gamma distribution .",
    "the corresponding parametrical density of states is computed exactly in the two ways described above ( from the saddle point route on the partition function in section [ subsection_saddle_p_meth ] and from it s calculus in section [ subsection_ito_m ] ) and constitutes a continuous deformation of the marenko - pastur distribution ( see below ) . in section [ section_cor_mp ]",
    "we compute the systematic @xmath44 ( for all @xmath43 ) and @xmath45 ( for @xmath9 ) corrections to the marenko - pastur law for the smoothed density in the bulk for the ( scaled ) @xmath0-wishart ensemble .",
    "for the special cases @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath49 , the @xmath50 correction term was computed in  @xcite .",
    "our result generalizes this to arbitrary @xmath0 for the @xmath50 term and in addition , we obtain the @xmath51 correction for @xmath46 and @xmath52 .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion in section [ concl ] .",
    "let @xmath53 be a real ( respectively complex ) gaussian random matrix of size @xmath54 , i.e. a random matrix chosen in the space of @xmath54 real ( resp .",
    "complex ) matrices according to the law : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath53 . in the following",
    ", we will denote the real ( resp .",
    "complex ) wishart ensemble by @xmath57 with @xmath46 in the real case ( resp .",

    "they have appeared in many different applications such as communication technology @xcite , nuclear physics @xcite , quantum chromodynamics @xcite , statistical physics of directed polymers in random media @xcite and non intersecting brownian motions @xcite , as well as principal component analysis of large datasets @xcite .",
    "the spectral properties of the wishart matrices have been studied extensively and it is known @xcite that for @xmath60 , all @xmath14 positive eigenvalues of @xmath61 are distributed via the joint probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a constant normalization factor and where @xmath46 in the real case ( resp . @xmath52 in the complex case ) .",
    "note that the joint distribution @xmath64 defined in is in fact well behaved for every @xmath28 .",
    "another classical result of random matrix theory concerns the asymptotic density of states ( or spectral measure ) for the eigenvalues @xmath65 of a real wishart matrix @xmath66 in the limit of large matrices , i.e. when @xmath67 with @xmath68 $ ] where @xmath69 is a fixed parameter .",
    "let us recall that the density of states of the matrix @xmath61 is simply the probability measure @xmath70 defined as @xmath71 where @xmath0 is introduced for later convenience ( @xmath72 in the present case ) and where @xmath73 are the eigenvalues of @xmath61 .",
    "setting @xmath74 , the marenko - pastur theorem ( see @xcite ) states that , in the limit @xmath75 with @xmath68 $ ] , the spectral measure of a wishart matrix @xmath66 converges to a continuous probability density ( with compact support ) given by @xmath76 where the edges @xmath77 of the spectrum are given by @xmath78 with again @xmath46 .    for general @xmath79 , the probability measure @xmath70",
    "is defined again as in where this time the vector @xmath73 is distributed according to the law @xmath64 in .",
    "the marenko - pastur theorem remains in fact valid for all @xmath43 in the sense that the probability law @xmath70 converges when @xmath75 with @xmath80 $ ] to the continuous probability density @xmath81 in for every @xmath28 .",
    "the probability measure @xmath70 will sometimes be referred to as the spectral density as it corresponds to the spectral density of random matrices @xmath82 at least when @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "we wish to define here a diffusive matrix process depending on a fictitious time @xmath83 that will converge to the wishart ensembles in the limit of large time .",
    "the idea is simply to set @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a real ( resp .",
    "complex ) random matrix process ( of size @xmath54 ) following the ornstein - uhlenbeck law , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a real brownian ( resp .",
    "complex ) random matrix , i.e. a matrix whose entries are given by independent standard brownian motions . by a standard brownian motion , one means a centered ( zero - mean ) gaussian process with covariance function @xmath88 .",
    "it is well known that the stationary law of a ornstein - uhlenbeck process is the gaussian law and therefore , the real ( resp .",
    "complex ) matrix process @xmath85 converges in law when @xmath89 to the law of a gaussian real ( resp .",
    "complex ) random matrix .",
    "hence , we deduce that the real ( resp .",
    "complex ) matrix process @xmath90 defines a diffusive matrix process that converges in law to @xmath82 with @xmath46 or @xmath52 .",
    "it is also easy to check that the positive definite matrix process @xmath90 verifies the following stochastic differential equation studied by bru @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath87 is a real ( resp .",

    "we will take in this section @xmath97 .",
    "we first need to introduce a family of real diffusion processes .",
    "let @xmath98 be a fixed parameter .",

    "it is also easy to verify that the stationary pdf of the langevin equation is the gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 defined as @xmath104 in analogy with squared bessel processes , the parameter @xmath105 will be called the _ dimension _ of the process @xmath99 .",
    "[ diffmat ] following @xcite , our goal is to construct a diffusive matrix process whose eigenvalues process is asymptotically distributed according to @xmath64 for general @xmath106 $ ] .",
