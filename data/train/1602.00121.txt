    "the relativistic approach leads to a closed system for a single perturbation variable , summarized as the _ lagrange ",

    ". we will then employ the gravitoelectromagnetic analogy that allows us to split the _ lagrange  einstein system _ into gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic parts .",
    "we will explain how the gravitoelectric hierarchy of perturbation solutions@xcite can be obtained from newtonian perturbation theory.@xcite    assuming a closed topological space form for the spatial hypersurfaces , we employ the hodge decomposition ( that replaces the helmholtz decomposition in standard perturbation theory ) to fully understand the physical content of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic solutions , exemplified to first order : the gravitoelectric part will turn out to be the integrable part of the cartan deformations , while the nonintegrable , gravitomagnetic part contains the gravitational waves .",
    "we consider a dust continuum ( i.e. , without pressure and velocity dispersion ) , governed by the euler  newton system of equations : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the eulerian velocity , @xmath3 the gravitational field strengh , and @xmath4 the density .",

    "in the lagrangian approach , the eulerian position @xmath22 is no longer an independent variable .",

    "this aspect is to say that the lagrangian description of structure formation intrinsically contains nonlinear eulerian terms . in the frame of newtonian gravity ,",
    "the lagrangian approach has proved to be more powerful than the eulerian one due to this reason .    in the next section",
    "we will present the lagrangian formulation of the einstein equations . since in general relativity matter",
    "is coupled to the geometry of spacetime , we give up the notion of absolute space and time , and the gradient of the vector function @xmath28 that describes the embedding into the absolute vector space has to be replaced by nonexact one  form fields , the cartan coframes .",
    "as we will discuss , this relativistic formulation exhibits interesting formal similarities with the newtonian theory . this can be exploited to build relativistic solutions to any order .",

    ", we will investigate the physical content of the complementary part @xmath57 in the general perturbation , and we will then discuss the link between these two solutions and the magnetic part of the weyl tensor .",

    "this asserts that any closed _ and simply  connected _ @xmath41manifold is homeomorphic to the hypersphere @xmath62 .",

    "these results can be extended to the quotients of @xmath62 .",
    "we discussed how the gravitoelectric part of relativistic perturbations can be constructed from the newtonian theory . at first order strong results for the general perturbation fields can be established by global considerations : for an @xmath62 topology of spatial sections the gravitoelectric part is integrable , while the nonintegrable part coincides with the gravitomagnetic part that is linked to the gravitational waves .",
    "formulating the einstein equations in terms of the hodge decomposition of cartan coframes may be of great use for upcoming research .",
