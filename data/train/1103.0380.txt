    "luna s theory of wonderful varieties establishes a connection between _ wonderful @xmath0-varieties _ for a semisimple complex algebraic group @xmath0 , and certain combinatorial objects called _ spherical systems _ of @xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main conjecture , i.e.  that spherical systems classify these varieties , is a work in progress and has been verified in many particular cases ( @xcite ) .",
    "uniqueness of the wonderful variety having a given spherical system has been proved by losev in @xcite , and a proof of the whole conjecture has been proposed by cupit - foutou in @xcite and @xcite using a different method .    beyond the classification ,",
    "the theory describes many geometric constructions and their combinatorial counterparts .",
    "for example , morphisms between varieties correspond to _ quotients _ of spherical systems .",
    "in this article we develop some techniques relating a spherical system to the generic stabilizer ( called a _ wonderful subgroup _ of @xmath0 ) of the corresponding variety .",
    "whenever such a wonderful variety exists , we say that the spherical system is _ geometrically realizable_.    two approaches to these techniques are possible . the first one is described in ",
    "[ s : fromto ] , and extracts informations on the wonderful subgroup @xmath2 only from the spherical system @xmath3 itself .",
    "this approach is direct , but yet unable to provide a complete description of @xmath2 , nor of a candidate @xmath2 in cases where geometric realizability of @xmath3 is not assured .    with this point of view , a levi part of @xmath2 ( as already pointed out in @xcite ) , can be guessed using the classification of reductive spherical subgroups of semisimple groups and the knowledge of their spherical systems .",
    "the unipotent radical is more elusive , although some strategy for it seems to be possible .",
    "our study of @xmath2 is also in some sense non - canonical , since it requires the choice of a parabolic subgroup of @xmath0 minimal containing @xmath2 : examples show that such a choice is not unique .",
    "the second approach , developed in   [ s : fiberprod][s : tails ] , involves the study of particular quotients of @xmath3 , which are supposed to be geometrically realizable . here",
    "we can produce a precise description for @xmath2 , proving at the same time the geometric realizability of @xmath3 .",
    "however , all is done assuming existence and knowledge of the generic stabilizers of some quotient of @xmath3 .",
    "we also review some results that were already known , always about the relationship between spherical systems and wonderful subgroups .",
    "we refine the results of @xcite on fiber products of wonderful varieties , and discuss the so - called projective fibrations ( see @xcite ) without restrictions on @xmath0 as a particular case of a more general situation : _ quotients of higher defect_.    all our work leads to the definition of _ primitive _ spherical systems , a direct generalization of the notion defined in @xcite and subsequent works .",
    "the corresponding wonderful varieties , called again _ primitive _ , play a significative role in the theory . in an analogy with representation theory",
    "they would correspond to indecomposable representations .",
    "in addition , the smaller class of primitive varieties admitting no quotient of higher defect would correspond to simple representations .",
    "primitive spherical systems can also be used to provide a proof of the existence part of luna s conjecture , in the same spirit of @xcite .",
    "namely , we prove that luna s conjecture follows from case - by - case analysis on primitive spherical systems without quotients of higher defect",
