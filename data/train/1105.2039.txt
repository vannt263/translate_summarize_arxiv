    "the reionization of the all - pervading intergalactic medium ( igm ) is a landmark event in the history of cosmological structure formation",
    ". studies of gunn - peterson absorption in the spectra of distant quasars show that hydrogen is highly photoionized out to redshift @xmath1 ( e.g. , fan , carilli , & keating 2006a ; songaila 2004 ) , while polarization data from the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) _ constrain the redshift of a sudden reionization event to be significantly higher , @xmath2 ( jarosik 2011 ) .",
    "it is generally thought that the igm is kept ionized by the integrated uv emission from active nuclei and star - forming galaxies , but the relative contributions of these sources as a function of epoch are poorly known . because of the high ionization threshold ( 54.4 ev ) and small photoionization cross section of , and of the rapid recombination rate of , the double ionization of helium is expected to be completed by hard uv - emitting quasars around the peak of their activity at @xmath3 ( e.g. , madau & meiksin 1994 ; sokasian , abel , & hernquist 2002 ; mcquinn 2009 ) , much later than the reionization of  and . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the declining population of bright quasars appears to make an increasingly small contribution to the 1 ryd radiation background , and it is believed that massive stars in galactic and subgalactic systems may provide the additional ionizing flux needed at early times ( e.g. , madau , haardt , & rees 1999 ; gnedin 2000 ; haehnelt 2001 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; meiksin 2005 ; trac & cen 2007 ; faucher - gigure 2008a ; gilmore 2009 ; robertson 2010 ) .",
    "this idea may be supported by the detection of escaping ionizing radiation from individual lyman - break galaxies at @xmath5 ( e.g. , shapley 2006 ) .    despite much recent progress",
    ", a coherent description of the thermal state and ionization degree of the igm remains elusive .",
    "the intensity and spectrum of the cosmic ultraviolet background remain one of the most uncertain yet critically important astrophysical input parameters for cosmological simulations of the igm and for interpreting quasar absorption - line data and derive information on the distribution of primordial baryons ( traced by , ,  transitions ) and of the nucleosynthetic products of star formation ( , , , , , etc . ) .",
    "this is the fourth paper in a series aimed at a detailed study of the generation and reprocessing of photoionizing radiation in a clumpy universe , and of the transfer of energy from this diffuse background flux to the igm . in paper i ( madau 1995 ) we showed how the stochastic attenuation produced by neutral hydrogen along the line of sight affects the colors of distant galaxies .",
    "in paper ii ( haardt & madau 1996 ) we developed cuba , a radiative transfer code that followed the propagation of lyman - continuum ( lyc ) photons through a partially ionized inhomogeneous igm .",
    "cuba outputs have been extensively used to model the  forest in large cosmological simulations ( e.g. , tytler 2004 ; theuns 1998 ; dav 1997 ; zhang 1997 ) . in paper iii ( madau 1999 ) we focused on the candidate sources of photoionization at early times and on the history of the transition from a neutral igm to one that is almost fully ionized . in this paper",
    "we describe a new version of cuba and use it to compute improved synthesis models of the uv / x - ray cosmic background spectrum and evolution , combining , updating , and extending many of our previous results in this field .",
    "the five main upgrade to cuba are : ( 1 ) the sawtooth modulation from resonant line absorption in the lyman series of intergalactic helium as well as hydrogen ; ( 2 ) the x - ray emissivity from the obscured and unobscured populations of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) that gives origin to the x - ray background ; ( 3 ) an up - to - date piecewise parameterization of the distribution in column density of intervening absorbers , which establishes the  super lyman - limit systems \" as the dominant contributors to the hydrogen lyc intergalactic opacity ; ( 4 ) an accurate treatment of the absorber photoionization structure , entering in the calculation of the helium continuum opacity and recombination emissivity of the clumpy igm ; and ( 5 ) the uv flux from star - forming galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "the plan is as follows . in ",
    "2 we review the basic theory of cosmological radiative transfer in a clumpy universe .",
    " 3 and  4 discuss the distribution of absorbers along the line of sight and their photoionization structure .",
    "the recombination radiation from the clumpy igm is calculated in  5 . in  6 and  7",
    "we compute the uv and x - ray emissivity from quasars , and in  8 the uv emissivity from star - forming galaxies .",
    "an overview of the main results generated by the updated cuba radiative transfer code is given in  9 .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in  10 . unless otherwise stated , all results shown below will assume a @xmath6 cosmology .",
    "note that , while the source volume emissivities must be evaluated in a given cosmological model , the resulting background intensity does not explicitly depend on the choice of cosmological parameters .",
    "we start by summarizing the basic theory describing the propagation of ionizing radiation in a clumpy , primordial igm ( e.g. , paper i ; paper ii ; madau & haardt 2009 ) . the equation of cosmological radiative transfer describing the time evolution of the space- and angle - averaged monochromatic intensity @xmath7 is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter , @xmath10 the speed of the light , @xmath11 is the absorption coefficient , and @xmath12 the proper volume emissivity .",
    "the integration of equation ( [ eq : rad ] ) gives the background intensity at the observed frequency @xmath13 , as seen by an observer at redshift @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the effective absorption optical depth of a clumpy igm , and @xmath12 is the proper volume emissivity .      in the case of lyc absorption by poisson - distributed systems ,",
    "the effective opacity between @xmath14 and @xmath19 is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bivariate distribution of absorbers in redshift and column density along the line of sight , @xmath22 is the continuum optical depth at frequency @xmath23 through an individual absorber , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the column densities and photoionization cross sections of ion @xmath27 .      besides photoelectric absorption , resonant absorption by the hydrogen and helium lyman series will produce a sawtooth modulation of the radiation spectrum ( madau & haardt 2009 ; haiman , rees , & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "continuum photons that are redshifted through the  frequency , @xmath28 , are resonantly scattered until they redshift out of resonance : the only two  line destruction mechanisms , two - photon decay and  bowen fluorescence ( kallman & mccray 1980 ) , can typically be neglected in the low metallicity , low density igm .",
    "this is not true , however , for photons passing through a higher order lyman - series resonance , which will be absorbed and degraded via a radiative cascade rather than escaping by redshifting across the line width .",
    "since the line absorption cross section is a narrow , strongly peaked function , the effective line absorption optical depth for a photon observed at @xmath29 that passed through a resonance at redshift @xmath30 , can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the frequency of the @xmath33 lyman - series transition ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 is the rest equivalent width of the line expressed in wavelength units .",
    "this opacity is dominated by systems having line center optical depths of order unity , i.e. , which lie at the transition between the linear and the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "consider , for example , radiation observed at frequency below the  of hydrogen or helium , @xmath36 .",
    "photons emitted between @xmath14 and @xmath37 can reach the observer without undergoing resonant absorption .",
    "photons emitted between @xmath38 and @xmath39 pass instead through the  resonance at @xmath38 and are absorbed .",
    "photons emitted between @xmath40 and @xmath41 pass through both the  and the  resonances before reaching the observer .",
    "the background intensity can then be written as ( madau & haardt 2009 ) @xmath42 where we have denoted with the symbol @xmath43 the  olbers integrals \" on the right hand side of equation ( [ jnu ] ) , calculated between redshifts @xmath44 and @xmath45 and with @xmath46 equal to the relevant continuum opacity , @xmath47 in equation ( [ jbeta ] ) , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the frequency at the lyman limit , and @xmath50 are the lyman - series effective opacities at redshifts @xmath51 . in the case of resonant absorption by , the lyc optical depth @xmath46 is zero in all @xmath52-integrals except the last , while in the case of  all terms must include photoelectric absorption by  and ( as well by  in the last term ) .",
    "equation ( [ jbeta ] ) is easily generalized to higher observed frequencies , @xmath53 , to read @xmath54 note how , in the case of large resonant opacities , only sources between the observer and the  screen \" redshift @xmath55 corresponding to the frequency of the nearest lyman - series line above @xmath13 will not be blocked from view : the background energy spectrum will show a series of discontinuities , peaking at frequencies just above each resonance , as the first integral in equation ( [ jres ] ) extends over the largest redshift path , and going to zero at resonance .",
    "each photon absorbed through a lyman series resonance causes a radiative cascade that ultimately terminates either in a ly@xmath56 photon or in two - photon @xmath57 continuum decay . in the former case",
    "the photon scatters until it is redshifted out of resonance , in the latter the photons escape to infinity without further interactions .",
    "consider , for example , the absorption of a  photon .",
    "the excited @xmath58 level is depopulated via @xmath59 decay ( h@xmath56 ) . in the low - density igm , collisional @xmath60-mixing of the @xmath61 levels ( seaton 1959 ) is negligible , and the cascade can only terminate in two - photon @xmath57 emission ( hirata 2006 ) . without @xmath60-mixing , the quantum selection rules forbid a  photons from being converted into : by contrast , excitation of the @xmath62 level by absorption of  can decay via the @xmath63 or @xmath64 levels to the @xmath65 and ultimately produce .",
    "more generally , the fraction , @xmath66 , of decays from an @xmath67 state that generates  photons can be determined from the selection rules and the decay probabilities .",
    "this fraction is found to increase as @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and to asymptote to 0.359 at large @xmath70 ( pritchard & furlanetto 2006 ) .",
    "note that this is valid in the approximation that the igm is optically thick to higher - order lyman - series transitions .",
    "what is the  diffuse flux produced by these lyman - series cascades ? let @xmath71 be the background intensity measured just above the  or  resonance at redshift @xmath19 .",

    "the same  cascade also produces a two - photon continuum with emissivity given by @xmath79\\ , { \\nu f_\\nu\\over ( 1+z)}\\,|dz / dt| ,   \\label{eq : epsi2}\\ ] ] where the two - photon emission function @xmath80 is expressed in photons per unit frequency interval and is symmetric about @xmath81 .",
    "we note that the underlying assumption in equations ( [ eq : epsia ] ) and ( [ eq : epsi2 ] ) is that every absorber is a source of unprocessed  line and two - photon continuum radiation , i.e. , that these photons escape into intergalactic space without appreciable local absorption . in the case of  emission , this requires negligible  in situ \" destruction from dust , metals (  bowen fluorescence ) , and photoelectric absorption by , so that the  photons diffuses into the wings and eventually escape from the production site into the igm .",
    "this is a good approximation at the low metallicities that characterize intergalactic absorbers ( kallman & mccray 1980 ) , even more so since the reprocessing of lyman series photons occurs in a  skin \" layer at the surface of an absorption system . in ",

    "in this appendix we describe the numerical calculations of the ionization structure of individual absorbers outlined in   [ sec : pho ] .",
    "we approximate each absorber as a semi - infinite slab with uniform hydrogen density @xmath447 and thickness equal to its jeans length , @xmath448 ( schaye 2001 ; faucher - gigure 2009 ) , where the adiabatic index and mean molecular weight for a monoatomic , fully ionized gas of primordial composition are @xmath449 and @xmath450 , respectively , and @xmath451 is the gas temperature in units of @xmath452 k. the gas mass fraction is set at its universal value , @xmath453 .",
    "each slab model provides , given the gas density @xmath454 and an external isotropic radiation field @xmath7 , the columns @xmath214 , @xmath455 , and @xmath220 .",
    "the slab geometry reduces the local radiative transfer to a 2-d problem ( see fig . [",
    "fig : slab ] ) . setting @xmath456 , where @xmath457 is the angle between the incident ray and the normal at the slab , the specific intensity @xmath458 at coordinate @xmath459 within the slab is given by the following implicit solution to the radiative transfer equation : @xmath460/\\mu } & ( 0<\\theta<\\pi/2);\\\\ i_\\nu(l,\\mu)\\,{\\rm e}^{-[\\tau_\\nu(l)-\\tau_\\nu(x)]/|\\mu|}\\,+{1\\over 4 \\pi |\\mu| } \\int_x^l dx'\\ , j_\\nu(x')\\,{\\rm e}^{-[\\tau_\\nu(x')-\\tau_\\nu(x)]/|\\mu| } & ( \\pi/2<\\theta<\\pi ) .",

    ", we can rewrite the external contribution to @xmath463 ( the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : j ] ) as @xmath468+e_2[2\\tau_\\nu ( l/2)-\\tau_\\nu(x)]\\},\\ ] ] ( @xmath469 ) , and the contribution of recombinations ( the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : j ] ) as @xmath470 thermal equilibrium in the absorbers is obtained by balancing photoionization heating with a number of different energy loss mechanisms : free - free , collisional excitations and ionizations , recombinations , compton cooling against the cosmic microwave backgroud , and adiabatic cooling from cosmic expansion .",
    "the photoheating rate ( per ion ) is given by @xmath471 where @xmath472 is the ionization potential of species @xmath27 .",
    "the equation of thermal equilibrium can then be written as @xmath473 where @xmath474 is the atomic cooling rate and the last term accounts for adiabatic cooling .",
    "our treatment of the thermal state of cosmological absorbers is over - simplified in two aspects : 1 ) the lowest density igm is not in thermal equilibrium ; and 2 ) dense quasar absorbers do not expand with the hubble flow .",
    "we find , however , that : 1 ) adiabatic cooling is never important for absorbers with @xmath475 @xmath245 , so the inclusion of this process does not alter the thermal balance in this column density regime ; and 2 ) in low the density , optically thin igm , the functions @xmath476 and ( to a lesser extent ) @xmath249 are independent on gas temperature , and hence the assumption of thermal equilbrium should not affect our results .",
    "the ionization and thermal structure of the slab , for a given @xmath7 and @xmath454 , are solved by iteration .",
    "we start by assuming an almost fully ionized slab at @xmath388 k , and compute the ionization rates @xmath194 setting the recombination emissivity to zero .",
    "we then solve for the ionization structure within the slab , compute updated ion fractions and opacities , and evaluate new ionization rates including recombination radiation .",
    "the process is iterated until convergence to better than 0.1% is obtained at every point of the slab . at each iteration the size of the slab is changed accordingly to the jeans criterion ( eq .  [ eq : jeans ] ) ."
