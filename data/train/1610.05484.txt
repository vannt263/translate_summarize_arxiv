    "ads / cft relates string theory in ads or asymptotically ads space to a supersymmetric @xmath0 yang - mills theory living on the boundary of this ads or asymptotically ads .",
    "the isometry group of the ads dictates the boundary field theory to be conformal . in recent years",
    ", several researchers have explored features of strongly coupled gauge theories formulated on time - dependent backgrounds .",
    "these backgrounds typically have past singularities .",
    "this is a region where gravitational fluctuations are strong .",
    "kasner metric is one example of this kind , where some of the directions shrink to zero sizes in the past creating singularity .",
    "interestingly , a four - dimensional kasner metric can be obtained as a near - brane limit of a @xmath1 brane of ten - dimensional supergravity .",
    "the general philosophy is that ads / cft correspondence is more general than gravity / gauge duality .",
    "this means , when the classical supergravity limit of string theory does not exist , for example near the singularity , it , in principle , does not prevent one from having a well - defined dual field theory right there .",
    "however , the successes in constructing such holographic models have been partial @xcite  @xcite .",
    "non - vacuum solutions are also studied in this context .",
    "for example in @xcite a non - zero dilaton field was considered . in this case , dilaton is of the form @xmath2 one can even embed frw universe in ads .",
    "then again this matter is just a non - dynamical scalar .",
    "also in @xcite attempt was made to understand frw universe . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", correlator approach was taken for the non - vacuum solution .",
    "all these attempts were made to understand cosmological singularity which is a spacelike singularity .",
    "on the other hand , there exist timelike singularity in nature .",
    "for example reissner ",
    "nordstrm black hole has a timelike singularity . in this work ,",
    "we consider the timelike cousin of kasner geometries .",
    "these have timelike naked singularities and , as we will see they appear in a certain limit of a ten dimensional @xmath1 branes",
    ".    consider near singularity geometry of reissner ",
    "nordstrm black hole , @xmath3 it would have been very good to extend this geometry to bulk taking ( [ nearsingrn ] ) as the boundary .",
    "but this is somewhat difficult . on the other hand , we take a toy geometry with timelike singularity .",
    "we use here a kasner - like geometry with timelike singularity . @xmath4 some properties , like bkl oscillations of this geometry was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the spacetime given in ( [ nearsingrn ] ) may be thought as a non - vacuum case of [ timekasner ] .",
    "these will give a better approximation of black hole singularity .",
    "although it is possible to treat non - vacuum cases , at least in some special cases , we are not doing that here .",
    "a bulk dual theory for normal kasner spacetime has been constructed before .",
    "this is one of the very few cases where it is possible to give a dual description .",
    "the field theory on the boundary is coming from certain deformation of @xmath1 branes .",
    "so we can guess the field theory should be some kind of deformed @xmath0 yang - mills theory with large @xmath5 . on the other hand , kasner spacetime has a singularity at @xmath6 , so it is a good testing ground for cosmological singularity .",
    "we here particularly take the approach of @xcite . in @xcite , for example",
    ", authors probe the singularity by cft operators with large conformal dimensions .",
    "the space - like correlators of cft operators with high scaling dimensions living on the boundary are taken as a probe .",
    "these correlators can be well - approximated by exponentiated length of bulk geodesics provided the geodesics go close enough to the cosmological singularity .    in @xcite",
    ", authors take a different route of computation . instead of calculating it on a fixed- time surface ,",
    "authors exploit the underlying scaling symmetry of the kasner ads spacetime to evaluate the equal - time correlator .",
    "the whole process can equivalently be thought of as evaluating the same on an arbitrary space - like surface which finally authors push all the way to cosmological singularity and extract the nature of the correlator therein .    in this present paper",
    ", we use both of these approaches as suitable in different cases .",
    "we take here a kasner - like geometry with timelike singularity and probe it with equal time correlators with cft operator of large scaling dimensions .    in the first case , we take a timelike surface of constant radial distance from the singularity .",
    "we then calculated equal - time correlator .",
    "then the radial distance is taken to 0 .",
    "it turns out this method is suitable for negative kasner exponent .",
    "we find the correlator goes to 0 just like what one find in positive exponent case for spacelike singularity . in the second case",
    ", we take a geodesic and send it as close as possible to the singularity .",
    "it turns out this method is suitable for positive kasner exponent .",
    "surprisingly , in this case , we find correlator goes to a constant value as the geodesic approaches singularity",
    ".    in the present set up , it is possible to compute minimal co - dimension 1 surfaces and take them towards the singularity .",
    "this is another way to probe properties of singularity . according to ryu - takayanagi prescription",
    ", the area of this minimal surface is related to entanglement entropy of two different regions of boundary field theory @xcite . in pure ads",
    "case nature of this co - dimension-1 surface is well studied , see for example @xcite . in our case , which is a locally ads , the changes in the nature of the minimal surface as we go towards singularity is studied here . however , the computation of the actual area near singularity turns out to be very difficult .",
    "we discuss here nature of this surface in this background .",
    "we organise the paper as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : brane ] we describe how a kasner spacetime with timelike singularity may come as a boundary of local ads space .",
    "here we show it comes from a strange type of brane construction . in section [ cod3 ] and [ cod1 ] ,",
    "we probe the timelike singularity of the kasner space . in [ cod3 ] , we probe this singularity by geodesic or co - dimension-3 curve . in certain approximation , it enable us to get correlator of the dual field theory . in section [ cod1 ] , we give a description of co - dimension 1 surface .",
    "we now take _ near horizon _ limit , @xmath15 of above geometry .",

    "we make a coordinate transformation as @xmath19 .",
    "we take @xmath20 for convenience . in this",
    "coordinates our new kasner-@xmath21 geometry becomes @xmath22\\;.\\ ] ] this geometry has a singularity at @xmath13 , again one can see this from the expression of kretschmann scalar , @xmath23 .",
    "the boundary of this geometry itself has this timelike singularity .",
    "we are going to investigate this singularity in this paper .",
    "we consider a quantum field theory resides on the boundary of ( [ newkads ] ) .",
    "we may think of this qft to be some deformed cft whose dual is given by ( [ newkads ] ) .",
    "let us consider co - dimension 1 and co - dimension 3 extremal spacelike surface in the boundary .",
    "both of them extend to bulk .",
    "the minimal co - dimension 3 extremal spacelike curve , the geodesic , gives correlator of an operator of the conformal field theory living on the boundary with large conformal dimension .",
    "whereas minimal co - dimension 1 surface gives entanglement entropy in the same cft .",
    "we now consider a dual gauge theory in the boundary of the bulk geometry mentioned in the previous section .",
    "we would like to compute @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are a state and an operator of the strongly coupled theory residing on the boundary .",
    "we insert two operators in the @xmath27-direction at the points @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this gives us an equal time correlator at a fixed @xmath30 .",
    "here we consider only operator with large conformal dimensions , @xmath31 , @xmath32 being spacetime dimensions , and large @xmath5 theory . in this limit of the theory and the operators",
    ", a well known approximate formula exists for the correlator .",
    "this formula in our case reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the regularized length of the geodesic connecting @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we already mentioned we would like to fix our two points in @xmath27 direction . that fixes time also and",
    "so we get equal time correlator .",
    "we choose two boundary points @xmath28 and @xmath29 at a fixed radial distance @xmath37 .",
    "corresponding geodesic must then have two fixed end points @xmath38 at the boundary @xmath39 at @xmath37 .",
    "for this particular calculation , therefore , the other boundary directions @xmath40 and @xmath41 are irrelevant . for the moment",
    ", we work with a general scale factor @xmath42 along @xmath27 .",
    "later , we will use the explicit form @xmath43 .    here",
    "we follow a similar approach used in @xcite . now calling @xmath27 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 as @xmath46 for notational simplicity ,",
    "the geodesic equations for ( [ newkads ] ) are given by @xmath47 here , we have taken radial coordinate , @xmath30 as a parameter and @xmath48 denotes derivative are with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "general solutions of these equations can be written as @xmath49 and @xmath50 } } .",
    "\\label{sufive}\\ ] ] one can see immediately that , with @xmath51 , reality of above expression implies @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "we would like to study correlator near singularity , that is , we eventually want to take @xmath30 to 0 .",
    "so in this subsection we take @xmath56 to be negative . in the next subsection",
    "we will study correlator near singularity for positive @xmath56 .      in case of @xmath55 ,",
    "our method is a bit different from @xcite .",
    "our differential equations ( [ suthree ] ) can be converted to hypergeometric differential equations with an argument @xmath57 .",
    "but here @xmath56 being negative and @xmath30 being close to 0 , we need to solve this hypergeometric differential equation around @xmath58 .",
    "that is one of the kummer s 24 solutions .",
    "so we take @xmath59 and solve it and then put back @xmath60 . in an appendix",
    ", we give a layout of this calculation . in solving these equations ,",
    "one generates integration constants .",
    "however , they can be fixed by properly setting boundary conditions .",
    "a coordinate shift fixes the constant comes from first @xmath44-integration .",
    "other two can be fixed - ( 1 ) by demanding @xmath61 at the turning point of the geodesic in @xmath62 plane and ( 2 ) by requiring @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "so with @xmath65 , above integration can be done .",

    "these expressions get simplified a lot for some specific values of @xmath56 .",
    "we choose such values to do a further calculation .",
    "let us keep the discussion general to write formal expressions .",
    "we would like to calculate regularized geodesic length first .",
    "this is given by @xmath78 this length turns out to be infinite for @xmath79 . to regularize this we subtract from @xmath80 the infinite part of geodesic length of pure ads",

    "this general calculation can be done numerically , however as we mentioned before the expressions of @xmath87 and @xmath88 get simplified for specific values of @xmath56 .",
    "so we have done explicit calculation of the regularized length for @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for @xmath89 @xmath87 and @xmath88",
    "simplifies to @xmath91 putting them back in ( [ geolen ] ) one finds @xmath92 and @xmath93 turns out to be @xmath94 \\;.\\ ] ] so the correlator @xmath95 so as we go towards singularity , @xmath96 , @xmath97 goes to @xmath98 , but we consider here only highly massive operator .",
    "so we see correlator goes to 0 near singularity",
    ". one should observe here that , at @xmath99 , @xmath97 diverges , but it is not a problem because it is an infrared divergence . similar behaviour can be observed for @xmath53 case in case of spacelike singularity in @xcite .",
    "we show another exponent @xmath90 to illustrate the result more clearly . again",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 get simplified .",
    "one gets , after doing the integration ( [ geolen ] ) , @xmath100 and consequently regulated length , @xmath101 \\;.\\ ] ] so the correlator , @xmath97 turns out to be @xmath102 in the limit @xmath96 this becomes @xmath103 , which is almost 0 for highly massive operators .",
    "we give here a plot of correlator .",
    "we choose @xmath104 for illustration purpose , for high value of mass it will go faster .",
    "vs. @xmath77 .",
    "blue and red graphs are for @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively ]      in this subsection we investigate singularity for _ expanding direction _ and to do that we follow @xcite .",
    "so here we fix our boundary at @xmath105 and let the geodesic probe the singularity .",
    "the turning point of the geodesic in the bulk is at @xmath106 , say .",
    "we take our geodesic as close as possible to the singularity , that is we take @xmath107 . for definiteness",
    "we take @xmath108 .",
    "the geodesic equations read @xmath109 here our boundary @xmath69 is at @xmath110 .",
    "the boundary conditions @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 fix @xmath44 and @xmath114 uniquely as @xmath115 we can now compute geodesic length between two points @xmath116 to @xmath44 in the boundary .",
    "this is given by @xmath117 note that here we set a small cut off near boundary , at @xmath118 .",
    "to regularise we subtract equivalent ads part .",
    "one finds after doing these state forward step",
    "@xmath119   = \\log \\left(4 + 12 r_*^{2/3}-16 r_*^2\\right ) \\;.\\ ] ] so the correlator becomes @xmath120 this correlator has a usual infrared singularity for @xmath121 but when we probe singularity by taking @xmath122 towards 0 we find no singular behaviour .",
    "it goes to @xmath123 , which is 0 for large mass .",
    "we give a plot of the behaviour of the correlator .     vs. @xmath122 for @xmath108 . ]",
    "so unlike spacelike singularity here no poles are observed near the singularity .",
    "in spacelike case , one finds correlator has a pole for expanding directions whereas it goes to 0 for contracting directions . in this case",
    ", both correlators behave smoothly . in the case of",
    "_ expanding _ direction , the correlator tends to increase but remains near zero for large mass , though it is not clear to us why the correlator behaves like this .",
    "in this section we discuss properties of spacelike surfaces near singularity .",
    "this surface is important in the context of entanglement entropy via ads dual .",
    "we consider a spacelike surface in the background of ( [ newkads ] ) .",
    "the region in the boundary we take is following : @xmath124 $ ] , @xmath125 $ ] and @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "this surface may extend to the @xmath114-direction . to find the area we need to find pull - back metric @xmath127 on this surface , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are coordinates on the surface .",
    "the area is given by @xmath130 we choose a gauge where @xmath131 and @xmath132 . in this gauge area",
    "functional turns out to be @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the volume of @xmath27 and @xmath135 directions . to find minimal surface one has to find euler - lagrange equation for area functional ( [ af ] ) .",
    "it turns out to be @xmath136 \\left[\\left(p_1+p_2\\right ) z z'+3 r\\right ] = 0 \\;.\\ ] ] in case of pure ads @xmath137 , and so euler - lagrange equation reduces to a much simpler form which can be solved exactly @xcite . in our case",
    ", it is difficult to solve analytically . to find a numerical solution",
    ", one has to fix boundary condition , to do that we use the fact that cross - section of the surface in @xmath138 plain has a turning point .",
    "the turning point , @xmath139 is at @xmath37 and at this point @xmath140 .",
    "the magenta curve is the surface described by [ el ] whereas dashed blue curve shows that of a pure ads . in this plot ,",
    "@xmath141 and @xmath142 . ]",
    "note that the surface described by [ el ] is slightly shifted from the minimal surface of pure ads .",
    "that is actually expected , because of the presence of @xmath143 in the area functional ( [ af ] ) . in the figure above we take @xmath144 .",
    "we notice here as @xmath145 becomes smaller two curves tend to coincide with each other .",
    "in the plot of figure:[fig:1 ] we take @xmath142 , it is clearly seen from the graphs below that , as we decrease @xmath83 , the shift becomes more prominent .",
    "but the nature of the curve remains almost same as we go towards the singularity .          to get the entanglement entropy one need the area",
    ". to get that one has to do the integration [ af ]",
    "this answer has to be regularised .",
    "a scheme of regularisation may be constructed by following way .",
    "we look back to the known case of pure ads .",
    "we set a small cut off , @xmath146 near the boundary .",
    "we find the area to be @xmath147 in the limit @xmath148 , last term goes to 0 , whereas the first term diverges as @xmath149 . in the same way , regularise the area in our case should be computed , that is , by subtracting @xmath149 of pure ads from numerically calculated area .",
    "it turns out very hard to calculate the area near singularity , even numerically .",
    "however , it is possible to calculate this when we are reasonable far from singularity .",
    "we thank shamik banerjee , amitabh virmani , sudipta mukherji for illuminating discussions on various occasions .",
    "the work of sc is supported in part by the dst - max plank partner group `` quantum black holes '' between iop bhubaneswar and aei golm .",
    "in this appendix , we give a method to solve equations ( [ suthree ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , these are equations convertible to a hypergeometric equation .",
    "we need to solve this equations around @xmath13 that means the argument of hypergeometric function @xmath150 should be around @xmath58 .",
    "so to do that we substitute @xmath151 right here . after solving we substitute back @xmath60 .",
