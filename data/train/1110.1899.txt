    "the low temperature relaxation of the magnetization of magnetic molecular solids such as 8 has proven difficult to understand ever since the earliest experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of this relaxation is highly non - exponential , and fits to forms such as stretched exponentials have provided no insight even when the fits seem to be good .",
    "a second puzzling feature is that for short times , the relaxation is observed to follow a square - root behavior with time in a large number of protocols : demagnetization , magnetization , and hole - digging in which the magnetic field is abruptly changed after the magnetization has been allowed to come to an equilibrium or quasi - equilibrium state in response to a previous value of the applied magnetic field .",
    "a good review of the subject is given by gatteschi , sessoli , and villain  @xcite .",
    "these authors give many more references to experimental studies @xcite , theoretical analyses @xcite , and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the fundamental microscopic mechanism by which the spin of an individual molecule changes at low temperatures ( say below 50 mk ) is incoherent tunneling between the lowest energy states . in both 8 and 12 ,",
    "the anisotropy of the molecule is of the ising type , and the lowest energy states have zeeman quantum numbers @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the spin of the molecule .",
    "the tunnel splitting between these states is of order 100  hz ( in frequency units ) for 8 and unobservably small for 12 .",
    "it must be stressed that in the solid , the tunneling is not of the coherent flip - flop type seen in the nh@xmath2 molecule , and previous authors have examined various decoherence processes by which the tunneling dynamics of a single molecule change from coherent to incoherent @xcite .",
    "this is not enough to explain the observed non - exponential time behavior , for if there were a single characteristic time scale for relaxation of a single molecule , and all molecules relaxed independently , the magnetization would relax essentially exponentially in time with the same time scale as for one molecule .",
    "thus , the non - exponential time behavior is a strong indicator that the molecules in the solid do not relax independently of each other .",
    "the biggest and most obvious coupling between molecules is the dipole - dipole interaction , and while this has been considered by many previous authors @xcite a complete theory is still lacking .",
    "in particular , the @xmath3 form has been previously explained by prokofeev and stamp  @xcite , but as noted by gatteschi , sessoli , and villain  @xcite it is unclear if it applies to all situations .",
    "these latter authors also give a heuristic argument for the @xmath3 law for the particular case of the demagnetization problem .",
    "we comment further or this below .    in this paper , we report on our attempt to solve this problem .",
    "our first approach is monte carlo simulation . in this",
    "we follow in the footsteps of refs .",
    "@xcite , and many aspects of our simulation and the results are very similar to those found by these authors .",
    "we then try to understand our monte carlo results by developing a set of rate equations .",
    "these rate equations entail the distribution of dipole fields at the molecular sites . for the specific problem of demagnetization",
    ", we can construct an approximate model for this distribution , which then enables us to solve the rate equations numerically .",
    "we find that the solution to the rate equations matches the monte carlo results quite closely .",
    "furthermore , we can show analytically that that the solution obeys a square - root behavior with time at short times .",
    "we emphasize that as in ref .",
    "@xcite we have only studied the demagnetization problem .",
    "further , the scaling behavior that we find for ancillary quantities also agrees entirely with ref .",
    "thus , we can claim no priority for this result .",
    "we also emphasize that our model for the dipole field distributions and the rate equations requires no further ingredients or fitting parameters beyond those involved in specifying the monte carlo process . in this paper",
    "we only look at the problem of demagnetization of a spherical sample with a cubic lattice in order to minimize the complications from demagnetizing fields , and focus on the shape independent aspects of the problem , but we believe that our rate equation approach offers a method to attack a much wider class of problems , and in the future we hope to study other experimental protocols , sample shapes , and lattice types .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in",

    "the relaxation of the magnetization of the entire solid is therefore a complex coupled process in which every individual spin essentially waits until it experiences a bias field less than @xmath30 in magnitude , and then flips with a probability per unit time equal to approximately @xmath31 .",
    "the flip of this spin changes the bias field at many other molecules , and if one of them then happens to have a near - zero bias field , it flips , leading to the possibility of flips at yet more molecules .",

    "as explained in , in this paper we only report on simulations on spherical samples of @xmath32 spins on a cubic lattice in order to eliminate the effects of inhomogeneous demagnetizing fields .",
    "in addition , we only consider the demagnetization process .",
    "thus , the spin @xmath26 is initialized to the value + 1 at every site .",
    "starting from this configuration , we simulate the time evolution of the sample ( as described below ) for between 60 and 500 runs , and then average the total magnetization of the entire sample over these runs .",

    "the flipping protocol we employ entails a slightly modified flip probability p_flip , i = _ 2 ^ 2 4w ( w - |e_i|)dt , [ p_flip2 ] instead of the original form ( [ p_flip ] ) . here",

    ", a spin flips only if the bias field on it is less than @xmath30 in magnitude .",
    "this modification is not material to the physics , and it reduces the run time of the simulations .",

    "the magnetization is measured at every time step .",

    "to understand our simulations , we have developed a theory based on rate equations .",
    "the key realization lies in the very different role played by the reversible and the nonreversible spins , and that we therefore need to understand the time - development of each set separately .",
    "we denote by @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 the total number of reversible spins at any instant ( i.e. , those with a bias satisfying @xmath87 ) , and the parts of this number whose spins are up or down .",

    "we have also introduced the quantity = _ 0 dt , in which the index _",
    "i _ is omitted in @xmath109 , since this is the flip probability for _ all _ reversible spins .",
    "clearly , our model assumes that the processes of flipping and of moving in or out of the reversibility range are independent , which in turn means that different spins flip or do not flip completely independently of each other , with a probability that depends only on the local bias .",
    "this assumption will be valid provided the bias distribution @xmath65 is reasonably spatially homegeneous across the sample at all times .",
    "such is the case for our spherical samples , but will need to be reexamined for other shapes .    with the above hypothesis , the change in the numbers of various types of spins in a short time interval @xmath4 are easily written down . for @xmath110 , we have dn_r = -_i + _ i ( 1 - ) + _ i . the first four terms on the right correspond to the four processes enumerated above for reversible spins , while the fifth term corresponds to nonreversible up spins becoming reversible .",

[ dnrdn ] adding the last two equations , we get a very simple equation for the change in the total number of reversible spins , dn_r = -_i + _ i , [ dnr ] which does not depend on @xmath109 at all , since we do not discriminate between up and down spins in the set @xmath96 , and the changes in its size are a function of the behavior of neighboring spins of the members of this set .    by taking the difference of",
    ", we get the change in the unnormalized reversible magnetization : dm_r = dn_r - dn_r",

    "lastly , we find @xmath114 , the change in the total unnormalized magnetization .",
    "since this change can come about only by the flipping of reversible spins , and since each flip changes @xmath115 by 2 , dm & = & -2 _",

    "let us begin by considering the two sums in one by one .",

    "it follows that ( _ i - _ i ) 4",
    "n_r m e_dm w f _ 0 dt . hence , = - 2_0 m_r - 4 _ 0 e_dm w n_r ( m_r - m f ) .",
    "[ dmrdt ]",
    "lastly , we obtain the equation for @xmath158 , which is the simplest of all : = -2_0 m_r .",
    "[ dmdt ]    equations ( [ dnrdt ] ) , ( [ dmrdt ] ) , and ( [ dmdt ] ) are the desired rate equations .",
    "they are manifestly nonlinear , but more importantly and contrary to our initial hope , they are not a closed system because of the presence of the functional @xmath150 of the full bias distribution @xmath65 . at present",
    "this puts a big limitation on their use . for the relaxation problem",
    "we have been able to circumvent this limitation by constructing an interpolation form for @xmath65 which we believe is reasonably accurate and self - consistent over a wide range of times , well past that over which the square - root time development is seen .",
    "we describe our approximation for @xmath65 in the next section .",
    "as seen from the monte carlo simulations , the bias distribution at short times is dominated by three peaks at @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",
    "the locations of the two side peaks are a strong indicator of their origin .",
    "consider a site with its six nearest neighbors .",
    "four of these neighbours are in the plane , and two are along the axis .",
    "if any of the neighboring spins in the plane flips from up to down , the bias at the central site will change by an amount @xmath77 , while if any of the axis neighbours flips , the field at the central site will change by @xmath78 .",
    "this explains the peak locations .",
    "further , since there are twice as many near neighbours of any site in the plane as there are along the axis , we should expext the peak at @xmath77 to be about twice as high as the peak at @xmath78 as long as @xmath162 .",
    "this is also seen in the data .",
    "the smaller peak at @xmath163 and shoulder at @xmath164 can also be associated with spin flips at pairs of near neighbour sites .",
    "motivated by this idea , we try and represent @xmath65 as a sum of three gaussians centered at 0 , @xmath165 , and @xmath78 .",
    "suppose that at a given time , @xmath64 spins have flipped where @xmath166 , allowing us to ignore the possibility that two flipped spins are near neighbours of each other or even of a common third spin .",
    "then there are @xmath167 spins that have a flipped neignbour in the plane , and @xmath168 spins that have a flipped neigbour along the axis , leaving @xmath169 spins which have no flipped neighbours at all .",
    "thus the weights of the 0 , @xmath77 and @xmath170 peaks are proportional to @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 respectively .",
    "we can further argue that the widths of all three peaks are equal and proportional to @xmath174 , since the fields at sites far away from all flipped spins should continue to vanish on average , but should have a variance that grows linearly with the number of flipped spins .",
    "for a site next to a flipped spin , this variance is simply realized around the shift produced by the flipped neighbour .",
    "thus for @xmath175 , the three - gaussian approximation ( tga ) to @xmath65 takes the form ( e ) ( 1 - 6 n _ ) g_0(e ) + 2 n _",
    "g_+(e ) + 4 n _",

    "[ g_gen ] that is , the peaks of the three gaussians are still taken to be at @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , the widths are taken to have a common value @xmath187 not necessarily proportional to @xmath174 , and the weights @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 are allowed to become arbitrary .",
    "we will determine these weights and the width by the procedure described in the next subsection .",
    "the form ( [ rho_small_n ] ) at small @xmath183 will serve as a check on the procedure .",
    "it is apparent that the tga is qualitatively incapable of accounting for the very narrow hole that is burned in the distribution at long times , but here a different approximation scheme can be developed as the origin of the hole is physically obvious .",
    "our discussion above implies that for very small @xmath183 , the flipped spins are randomly distributed in the lattice without any spatial correlations .",
    "we therefore extend this idea to larger @xmath183 and consider a model in which the spin on each site is up or down independently of other spins , with probabilities @xmath191 , where @xmath75 is the magnetization .",
    "we then calculate the first three moments of this model , and match those to the moments of the tga , .",
