    "the standard model of elementary particle physics ( sm ) has been verified in many of its details with enormous precision over the last 20  years",
    ". however , several fundamental questions remain unanswered .",
    "perhaps the most important unresolved problem concerns the origin of the particle masses .    in the sm ,",
    "the underlying mechanism for mass generation is spontaneous breakdown of the electro - weak gauge symmetry . in its minimal version ( which we will assume throughout this paper )",
    "it predicts a single , as yet undetected physical particle , the higgs boson .",
    "it is determined to be electrically neutral and of spin zero .",
    "its mass , however , is a free parameter of the theory .",
    "the extensive searches for the higgs boson at particle colliders have set a lower bound on its mass , the latest update yielding a limit of around 108gev  @xcite . on the other hand , theoretical predictions for physical observables depend on the higgs mass through radiative corrections .",
    "comparison of the existing experimental precision data with their theoretically predicted values allows to derive a most probable range for the higgs mass which turns out to be roughly between 100 and 200gev  @xcite .    with lep being close to its maximum possible energy ,",
    "the attention concerning higgs search is turning towards future experiments at hadron colliders , in particular lhc , scheduled for the year 2007 , or already tevatron s runii , starting in 2001 .    the dominant production mechanism for a higgs boson with a mass below 1tev at the lhc will be through gluon - gluon fusion ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling of the gluons to the higgs boson is mediated through a quark loop , fig.[dia::triangle](a ) . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the corresponding form factor becomes independent of the quark mass .",
    "thus , this process can be used , for example , to count the number of heavy quarks that may exist beyond the third generation .",
    "the current theoretical prediction for this reaction carries an uncertainty of about a factor of 1.5 to 2 .",
    "it is therefore important to improve on the theoretical accuracy . in this paper",
    "we provide a gauge invariant ingredient to the complete next - to - next - to - leading order prediction , namely the virtual corrections up to order @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation is , to our knowledge , the first application of a recently introduced method that allows to relate the relevant set of vertex diagrams to the more familiar class of three - loop two - point functions .",
    "as it was mentioned before , the coupling of the gluons to the higgs boson is mediated through a quark loop , fig.[dia::triangle](a ) .",
    "since all quarks except for the top are much lighter than the current lower limit on the higgs mass , we will neglect their masses in the following . in this case , the top quark is the only one that couples directly to the higgs boson , because the higgs - fermion vertex is proportional to the fermion mass .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in addition to their topology and the power of the denominators , the resulting integrals can be classified by the power of irreducible numerators , i.e.  invariants of momenta that can not be expressed in terms of denominators . in @xcite ,",
    "the integrals with unit ( or zero ) power of denominators and low powers of irreducible numerators were evaluated using feynman parameterization and dispersion techniques .    in @xcite recurrence relations based on the integration - by - parts algorithm @xcite for the planar two - loop integrals were derived , reducing them to convolutions of one - loop integrals .",
    "these relations allow to compute any such planar diagram with arbitrary powers of the denominators and irreducible numerators .    in our case , however , we also need to compute non - planar diagrams , e.g.   fig.[fig::2lvirt](b ) . for this reason ,",
    "we follow an algorithm that has recently been published by baikov and smirnov @xcite .",
    "it relates the recurrence relations for @xmath2-loop integrals with @xmath3 external legs to the ones for ( @xmath4)-loop integrals with @xmath5 external legs .",
    "here we have @xmath6 , and thus the massless two - loop vertex diagrams of fig.[fig::2lvirt ] are mapped onto massless three - loop two - point functions . the algorithm to compute the latter ones",
    "is known @xcite and implemented in the computer program mincer @xcite , written in form @xcite . following the recipe of @xcite",
    ", we modified the mincer routines such that they are applicable to the class of two - loop three - point functions at hand .",
    "for the generation of the diagrams we used qgraf  @xcite as integrated in the program package geficom  @xcite .",
    "the only integral that can not be reduced to convolutions of one - loop integrals in this approach is the non - planar one with all propagators appearing in single power , and with numerator equal to one .",
    "however , the result for this integral is known as an expansion in @xmath7 up to its finite part @xcite .    as a check of our setup we re - did the calculation of the electro - magnetic quark form factor in qcd to two loops and found full agreement with @xcite .",
    "we performed this calculation in a general @xmath8 gauge and explicitly checked its gauge parameter independence in this way .",
    "we also computed the two - loop three - gluon vertex in @xmath8 gauge with two gluons on - shell and found agreement with @xcite .",
    "finally , the calculation of the present paper was also performed in @xmath8 gauge and we verified that the gauge parameter dependence disappears in the sum of all diagrams .",
    "the virtual cross section for the process @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the coefficient function given in eq.([eq::coefc ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath13 comes from the average over initial state polarizations and color .",
    "the kinematical constraint on the momenta is @xmath14 @xmath15 is the polarization vector of a gluon with momentum @xmath16 and polarization @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively @xmath19 are the su(3)-color and the lorentz indices . adopting a covariant @xmath8 gauge ,",
    "the polarization vectors obey the relation @xmath20    the tensor @xmath21 may be written as @xmath22\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq::tensor}\\ ] ] the last two terms seem to violate gauge invariance .",
    "however , to lowest order they vanish , and starting from next - to - leading order , their contribution to the squared matrix element gets canceled by the diagrams with ghosts in the initial state .",
    "we explicitly checked this cancelation by computing these ghost diagrams to the corresponding order .",
    "further , we have @xmath23 and thus the @xmath24 term in ( [ eq::tensor ] ) does not contribute to the total rate",
    ". therefore we will only quote the result for @xmath25 in the following .",
    "its loop expansion can be written as @xmath26 the first order correction has been computed in @xcite up to the finite part . since it involves a second order pole in @xmath7 and we are also interested in the finite part of its square , we need its expansion up to @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the thooft mass , and @xmath30 is riemann s zeta function ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is understood that @xmath34 .    to this",
    "we add the second order correction : @xmath35 + { 1\\over        { \\epsilon}^2}\\,\\bigg [ -{67\\over 32 } - { 9\\over 16}\\,\\zeta_2 + { 5\\over        48}\\,n_l \\bigg ] \\\\",

    "where , as before , @xmath36 is the number of light quark flavors , @xmath37 .",
    "ultra - violet renormalization of the strong coupling constant is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is related to the @xmath40 function of eq .",
    "( [ eq::beta ] ) through @xmath41",
    "both as a check and as an estimate on the magnitude of the corrections , we may consider the ratio of the time - like to the space - like form factor .",
    "it is free from infra - red singularities and contains the presumably most significant contributions stemming from the analytic continuation of the factor @xmath42 from space - like to time - like values of @xmath43 .",
    "as was shown in  @xcite for the quark form factor in qcd  @xcite , this ratio can be derived up to @xmath44 from the _ one_-loop terms of the form factor by combining them with a known two - loop anomalous dimension . in the case of @xmath9 this anomalous dimension is given by @xmath45 times the one given in  @xcite . following the derivation of  @xcite and setting @xmath46",
    ", we arrive at the following expression : @xmath47 where we inserted @xmath37 in the second line .",
    "the third line displays separately the lo , nlo and the nnlo contribution , as well as their sum , for @xmath48 .",
    "eq.([eq::ratiogam ] ) fully agrees with a direct evaluation of the ratio using the expressions ( [ eq::a ] ) , ( [ eq::a1 ] ) , and ( [ eq::a2 ] ) for @xmath25 .",
    "this provides a check on the terms @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) of our result .",
    "the numerical value of the nlo correction in eq.([eq::ratiogam ] ) reflects the largeness of the full nlo terms as obtained in @xcite .",
    "the number for the nnlo corrections gives some hope towards a certain degree of convergence for the perturbative series of the full result for @xmath51 . concluding this section ,",
    "let us note that an interesting extension of this discussion could be the resummation of the leading terms along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we used the recently introduced method of @xcite in order to calculate the nnlo virtual corrections to the production cross section of higgs bosons in gluon fusion .",
    "the result is a gauge invariant component of the full cross section .",
    "the next step towards a complete answer for the nnlo rate is to integrate the squared amplitudes for the real radiation processes over the phase space .",
    "this is work in progress  @xcite . finally , one has to convolute the full partonic cross section with the parton distribution functions .",
    "their evaluation to the relevant order is therefore certainly a very important task .",
