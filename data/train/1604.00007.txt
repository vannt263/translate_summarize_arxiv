    "<S> in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , the superpartners of the top quark ( stops ) play the crucial role in addressing the naturalness problem . for direct pair - production of stops with each stop decaying into a top quark plus the lightest neutralino , the standard stop searches have difficulty finding the stop for a compressed spectrum where the mass difference between the stop and the lightest neutralino is close to the top quark mass , because the events look too similar to the large @xmath0 background . with an additional hard isr jet , </S>",
    "<S> the two neutralinos from the stop decays are boosted in the opposite direction and they can give rise to some missing transverse energy . this may be used to distinguish the stop decays from the backgrounds . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the semileptonic decay of such signal events for the compressed mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> although the neutrino from the @xmath1 decay also produces some missing transverse energy , its momentum can be reconstructed from the kinematic assumptions and mass - shell conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it can then be subtracted from the total missing transverse momentum to obtain the neutralino contribution . because it suffers from less backgrounds , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the semileptonic decay channel has a better discovery reach than the fully hadronic decay channel along the compressed line @xmath2 . with 300 @xmath3 , the 13 tev lhc can discover the stop up to 500 gev , covering the most natural parameter space region . </S>"
