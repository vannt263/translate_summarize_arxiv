    "s original software design @xcite proposed several complimentary event data formats , as described in table  [ tab : formats ] .",
    "these formats were intended to satisfy different use cases , from quality control to reconstruction to calibration to physics analysis , with each format optimized for some specific purposes .",
    "each format was written to separate objectivity databases ( files ) , so that they could be accessed and managed independently .",
    "the format is an objectivity transcription of the raw data readout by the detector online system , and was intended to be used as the input to the reconstruction chain .",
    "the format represents the reconstructed physics objects , and was intended to be used for detector studies , for detailed analysis , and for single event display .",
    "the format is a summary of the reconstruction results , and was intended to be the primary format used for high - statistics physics analysis .",

    "in april 2002 computing was reviewed by a combined internal and external review board . among other recommendations ,",
    "the report of this committee @xcite suggested that reconsider its analysis model in light of the opportunities offered by the . in response to these recommendations , a new computing model was adopted by the collaboration in december 2002 .",
    "this model introduces two major changes , first that the event store be converted to use root persistence instead of objectivity , and second that the existing physics analysis format ( ) be replaced with a new format more consistent with the .",
    "after some discussion , a reduced customized for analysis has been chosen as the format replacement .    to replace the format ,",
    "the analysis reduced must have a similar size on disk and read - back speed as .",
    "the starting point for achieving this is to store only those quantities referenced in cache mode .",
    "performance results from a prototype analysis reduced are given in tables [ tab : modes ] and [ tab : evtsizes ] , showing that it is similiar to .",
    "a major effort is now underway at to improve the read - back performance .",
    "based on profiles of a standard analysis job , the largest time sinks come from inefficiency in the reconstruction code invoked when reading the , and in the analysis interface to the ( see table [ tab : time ] ) . based on the problems already identified ,",
    "the read speed is expected in increase by between a factor of 2 and 10 .    in the new computing model ,",
    "the analysis reduced will store only the cache mode information .",
    "the remainder of the information will be stored in a separate file .",
    "the complete will be accessed by reading both the reduced and remainder information .",
    "thus will store event data in a coherent format , split into pieces specialized for analysis and detector studies , with no redundancy and easy navigation between the two pieces .",
    "a requirement of the new computing model is that the replacement be accessible interactively . as part of satisfying this requirement ,",
    "has chosen root as the persistence technology for the replacement , since it has been shown to work as a hep event store technology both at and elsewhere , and because the root / cint interface is a standard interactive access mechanism .",
    "to satsify this requirement , the is being ported to root persistence .",
    "the root persistent implementation uses base classes developed at which allow interactive access to packed data contents of embedded objects , by dynmaically linking class functions into root @xcite .",
    "a key feature of the new computing model is the ability to create custom output streams for physics groups , by exploiting the configurability of the .",
    "coupled with the interactive access capabilty afforded by root persistence , it is hoped that custom streams can replace the format dump ntuples used in most analyses .",
    "this will substantially reduced the computing and human resources used in analysis .    because is a functioning experiment ,",
    "the new computing model must be introduced in a way that does not disrupt ongoing efforts , and quickly enough that its benefits can be exploited before the experiment ends .",

    "has just completed a full data re - processing , in which the complete replaced the unused , , and formats .",
    "this reduced the volume of data produced in reconstruction by a roughly factor of 10 , significantly improving the efficiency of the event reconstruction farm , and requiring half as many data servers compared to previous processings .",
