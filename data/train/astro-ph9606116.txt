    "galaxy , group and cluster distributions probe matter clustering in the universe , not only over different scales , but also for different density contrasts .",
    "however , while galaxy and cluster clustering have been widely inspected , a measurement of group clustering meets several conceptual and technical difficulties and it is not surprising that its results are controversial and partially contradictory .    in this note",
    "we report the result of an analysis of clustering properties of loose groups in the perseus ",
    "pisces redshift survey ( hereafter pps ; see giovanelli , haynes , & chincarini 1986 ; haynes et al . 1988 ; giovanelli & haynes 1989 , 1991 , 1993 ) . through such analysis",
    "we believe that the reasons of previous discrepant results become clear .",
    "it is also worth soon mentioning that our error analysis , based on bootstrap criteria , detects a precise signal of clustering for loose groups above statistical noise .",
    "as is known , the 2point functions of galaxies and clusters are consistent with the power laws @xmath11 characterized by the same exponent @xmath12 , but by widely different amplitudes @xmath1 and @xmath13 .",
    "the detection of such difference ( bahcall @xmath14 soneira 1983 , klypin @xmath14 kopylov 1983 ) led kaiser ( 1984 ) and politzer @xmath14 wise ( 1984 ) to suggest the mechanism of biased galaxy formation .",
    "results are far less clear for galaxy groups . jing @xmath14 zhang ( 1988 , hereafter jz88 ) and maia @xmath14 dacosta ( 1990 , hereafter mdc90 ) claimed that the 2point function for groups is still consistent with a power law @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18@xmath19 . on the contrary , ramella ,",
    "geller , & huchra ( 1990 , hereafter rgh90 ) found @xmath20 and , although their analysis can not reject a value @xmath21 , the preferred value ranges around 1@xmath22 . according to rgh90",
    ", the main contribution to @xmath23 comes from the the 2point function @xmath24 of galaxies members of groups .",
    "recently frederic ( 1995a&b , hereafter f95 ) determined @xmath25 for haloes and halo groups in cdm simulations by gelb ( 1992 ) .",
    "he found groups to be significantly more correlated than single halos , and interpreted this as contrasting with rgh90 s results for galaxies and galaxy groups ( but he also showed that the correlation strength depends on the prescription adopted for halo identification and illumination ) .    in all the above mentioned studies , groups were identified with the adaptive friends  of  friends algorithms of huchra & geller ( 1982 ; hg82 hereafter ) or nolthenius & white ( 1987 ; hereafter nw87 ) .",
    "such algorithms require several input parameters .",
    "some ( the galaxy luminosity function @xmath8 and the magnitude limit @xmath7 ) are set by the data themselves .",
    "others ( the `` sky  link '' @xmath6 and the `` redshift  link '' @xmath10 ) must be decided by the user : @xmath6 can be related to the normalization @xmath26 of @xmath8 ( nw87 ) , while the choice of @xmath10 is more complex ( hg82 ; nw87 ; ramella , geller , & huchra 1989 , rgh89 hereafter ) .",
    "as already pointed out by nw87 , confirmed by rgh89 , and stressed by nolthenius , klypin , & primack ( 1994 , 1995 ; hereafter nkp94&95 ) , a delicate point in group analysis is the _ sensitivity _ of the results to the details of the adopted algorithm and/or data set . also forgetting possible intrinsical differences among the galaxy samples where groups were drawn from , the different search parameters of the algorithm used to identify galaxy groups could be at the origin of the above mentioned discrepancies .",
    "however , as we shall see below , this is actually more relevant for internal than for clustering properties ( f95 ; trasarti battistoni 1995 , 1996  tb96 hereafter ) .",
    "another problem is the high noise in the determination of @xmath27 , due to the limited extension of the group catalogs previously studied .",
    "loose groups in pps were systematically identified and analyzed in tb96 , who concentrated mainly on internal properties and their dependence on the adopted algorithm and/or data sample .",
    "differences between data samples are small but detectable , and the effect of the magnitude limit @xmath7 is to be properly taken into account . note that pps is wider than the cfa2 slices ( de lapparent , geller , & huchra 1986 , 1988 , 1989 ",
    "dlgh86/88/89 hereafter ; geller & huchra 1989 ; huchra et al . 1990 , huchra , geller , & corwin 1995 ) used by rgh8990 and f95 , and is spatially disconnected from them as it lies in a different galactic hemisphere .",
    "it is also deeper than the redshift surveys cfa1 ( davis & huchra 1982 , davis et al .",
    "1982 , huchra et al . 1983 ) and ssrs1 ( da costa et al . 1988 ) , where groups identified by geller & huchra ( 1983 ; hereafter gh83 ) and maia , dacosta , & latham ( 1989 ; hereafter mdcl89 ) were used by jz88 and mdc90 , respectively .",
    "in fact , the number of groups in pps is @xmath28-@xmath29 , while it is @xmath30-@xmath31 in the other samples , and this helps to reduce the above mentioned statistical noise .",
    "internal properties of groups have been used to constrain cosmological models and , in particular , the dark matter composition ( nkp94&95 ) .",
    "also group clustering has been suggested as a test for cosmological models , both on analytical bases ( e.g. , kashlinsky 1987 ) , or through the comparison with numerical n  body simulations ( f95 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the key point is that galaxy groups can be identified automatically and _ exactly in the same way _ both from galaxy catalogs and from large ( @xmath32 ) n  body simulations ( nw87 ; moore , frenk , & white 1993 ; nkp94&95 ; f95 ) .",
    "although such groups are basically expected to be physical objects this is no longer the basic requirement to have an effective comparison . once groups are suitably defined , then properties are compared to find out which simulation best matches the observations .",
    "there is a precise physical reason which favours loose groups over single galaxies ( and compact groups ) or rich clusters as a test of cosmological models . at intermediate separations ( @xmath33 ) , mass scales ( @xmath34 ) , and density contrast ( @xmath35@xmath36 ) typical of galaxy groups ,",
    "gravitational evolution is still in the mildly non  linear regime .",
    "therefore , lss keeps memory of the shape of the post  recombination power spectrum @xmath37 . at larger scales linearity keeps the lss signal at a level too low in respect to the noise , so @xmath37 is not easily detectable , and the limited extension ( in volume and number of objects ) of available observational samples is often a problem . at smaller scales",
    "stronger non  linear and non  gravitational effects complicate everything .",
    "moreover , the most widely studied observational samples of rich clusters ( abell 1958 ; abell , corwin , olowin 1989 ) suffer of various biases ( sutherland 1988 ; see borgani 1995 for a review ) , mainly due to partially subjective criteria used in their compilation . compact groups and rich clusters",
    "were recently identified from observational samples also employing objective and automatic procedures ( prandoni , iovino , & macgillivray 1994 ; nichol et al .",
    "1992 ; dalton et al .",
    "1992 ; nichol , briel , & henry 1994 ) .",
    "however such procedures are difficult to reproduce on n  body simulations .",
    "this is due to a combined need of high resolution ( to ease object identification ) , large sample volume ( to have a statistically meaningful number of objects ) , and computational speed ( to reach a statistically meaningful number of independent realizations of the same theoretical model ) .",
    "in the case of clusters , the latter two difficulties can be circumvented by using a combination of numerical and analytical approaches based on the zeldovich approximation ( e.g. , sahni & coles 1995 ; borgani et al .",
    "1995 ) , but the identification of observational  like clusters is still not an easy task .    the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ sez : data ]",
    "we describe the galaxy data and the group catalogs , while section [ sez : xi ] describes the estimation of clustering properties .",
    "results are presented and discussed in section [ sez : resdis ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in in section [ sez : conclu ] .",
    "the pps database was compiled by giovanelli & haynes in the last decade ( see giovanelli & haynes 1991 , 1993 ; wegner , giovanelli , & haynes 1993 , and the references therein ) .",
    "the full redshift survey is magnitude  limited down to @xmath38 , and now it covers the whole region @xmath39 and @xmath40 . as in tb96",
    ", we restricted to the region @xmath41 and @xmath42 , to avoid regions of high interstellar extinction .",
    "magnitudes are anyway corrected as in burstein & heiles ( 1978 ) , and redshifts are corrected for galactic rotation and local group motion as in yahil , sandage , & tamman ( 1977 ) .",
    "the two subsamples pps1 and pps2 ( shown in fig",
    ".  1 , top panels ) are magnitude  limited to @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , in analogy with cfa1 and cfa2 .",
    "this makes our comparison of data sample as clean as possible .",
    "in fact , the selection criteria of ssrs makes it qualitatively different from cfa or pps . on the other hand , the full cfa1 ( north+south ) and the first two cfa2 slices in the north are neither fully disjoint ( as pps2 and cfa2 slices ) nor one a subset of the other ( as pps1 of pps2 ) .",
    "the shape of the survey is also important .",
    "it is more difficult to identify groups in the proximity of the edges , so wide angle surveys are favoured over thin slices or pencil beams .",
    "to summarize , pps1 ( pps2 ) covers a solid angle @xmath45 , and consists of 769 ( 3030 ) galaxies with magnitude @xmath46 and redshift @xmath47 . for comparison ,",
    "the previously analyzed subsamples of cfa1 n+s , ssrs1 , and cfa2 slices , are characterized respectively by : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath51 , @xmath43 , @xmath52 ( apparent  diameter  limited ) , @xmath44 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the characteristics of all group catalogs are listed in table 1 .",
    "the two significative cases tb96@xmath56 and tb96@xmath57 ( in pps1 and pps2 , respectively ) are also shown in fig .  1 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "groups are identified with the friends  of  friends algorithms described in tb96 , both hg  like ( hg82 ) and nw  like ( nw87 ) .",
    "briefly , two galaxies closer then some specified transverse separation @xmath5 and radial separation @xmath9 in redshift space are friends of each other .",
    "friendship is transitive , and a galaxy group is an isolated set of friends .",
    "the two links are normalized by @xmath6 and @xmath10 at a given fiducial redshift ( here @xmath58 ) , and are then scaled  up with @xmath59 , using the selection function @xmath60 here @xmath7 is the apparent  magnitude limit of the sample , @xmath61 is the galaxy luminosity function , @xmath62 is the faintest absolute magnitude in the sample , while the dependence on @xmath63 and @xmath59 arises through @xmath64 to scale up the links , the original hg prescription ( based on simple arguments , monte  carlo tested ) gives @xmath65 , while the nw recipes ( based and tested on n  body simulations ) takes @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , where @xmath59 is the mean redshift of the pair of galaxies considered , and @xmath68 is a suitable constant ( for a detailed discussion of the reasons behind such different choices , see tb96 and the references therein ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 corresponds to an effective density threshold ( in redshift space ) , given by @xmath69^{-1 } \\ ] ] we adopt the galaxy luminosity function in the schechter ( 1976 ) form determined from pps2 by tb96 ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; here we take @xmath72 ) .",
    "the number of groups in all catalogs is approximately @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 in pps2 and @xmath75 in pps1 . for sake of comparison , @xmath76,@xmath77 , and @xmath78 in jz88 , mdc90 , and rgh90 respectively .",
    "it is clear that the characteristics of each groups catalogue are fixed , to some extent , by the choice of parameters in the identification algorithm .",
    "smaller values of the links @xmath6 and @xmath10 yield groups with higher density contrast and , within biased theories of galaxy formation , this is expected to cause a stronger spatial correlation .",
    "as outlined in tb96 , a similar effect arises from the sample depth .",
    "this subtler point requires some explanation .",
    "it is clear that the increase of the mean galaxy density , which occurs when the magnitude limit passes from @xmath79 to @xmath80 , is accounted for by a slower decrease of the selection function with @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , eq .  [ eq : m_lim ] shows that @xmath81 , provided that @xmath82 ; accordingly , everything which happened at @xmath83 is now moved to @xmath84 , in the deeper sample . everything is therefore scaled , apart of @xmath85 , the redshift value where the sky  link @xmath5 is normalized .    normalizing at the _ same _ location @xmath86 for _ different _ @xmath7 s yields different density contrasts @xmath87 for the same value @xmath6 .",
    "groups identified with the same values of @xmath6 and @xmath10 are then expected to be more correlated in pps1 then in pps2 .",
    "an analogous effect is expected for the redshift ",
    "link @xmath9 , though different for the hg and nw algorithms .",
    "in fact , rgh90 suggested that the different values jz88 and mdc90 adopted for @xmath10 could account for the discrepancies from their results , but they did not take into account the stronger effect presumably arising from the different @xmath7 .",
    "( the effects of changing @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath10 , are shown in fig .  5 ;",
    "a much more detailed discussion will be provided in sect .",
    "[ sez : resdis ] . )",
    "it is also importants to outline that giving the @xmath6 link is not immediately equivalent to providing a threshold density contrast . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn_n ] ) , @xmath88 , but @xmath26 variations by a factor of 2 can arise both from observational techniques and/or local physical conditions .",
    "the other parameters determining the schechter function , adopted by rgh89 and f95 , and worked out by dlgh88 ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) are almost consistent with those worked out from our sample .",
    "tb96 showed that , for similar changes ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) , the net effect on the internal properties of output groups is small .",
    "furthermore , the spatial distribution of groups is almost insensitive even to greater differences in the identification algorithm .    as shown by dlgh88 and martinez et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , estimates of @xmath25 are sensitive to the presence of large scale features in the samples . in the present analysis",
    ", we cut _ all _ samples within @xmath93 .",
    "the number of groups does not change in pps1 ( 767 galaxies ) , while it is reduced by @xmath94@xmath95 in pps2 ( 2693 galaxies ) . this cut ",
    "off ensures that we are always dealing with the same physical structures , though differently sampled by different @xmath7 s .",
    "the same main lss features are present in both galaxy samples , and they are reflected on the spatial distribution of groups ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "let us now describe the procedure leading to the 2point function estimate",
    ". as usual , we center spherical shells of radius @xmath96 and width @xmath97 on each observed object in the data ( @xmath98 : galaxy / group ) sample .",
    "we then count neighbours in the data sample and in a random control sample , spatially uniform but with the same shape and radial selection function as the data .",
    "to do so , @xmath99 random points are taken from a spatially uniform distribution with the same shape of the data sample , but they are weighted down by the selection function @xmath100 . in particular , the total number of random points @xmath99 is replaced by the total weight @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the weight of the @xmath103 random point .",
    "we then divide the number @xmath104 of ( observed ) neighbour objects within @xmath105 by the ( weighted down ) number @xmath106 of neighbour random points , and then average over all @xmath107 centers .",
    "our weighting scheme is analogous to that of the @xmath108 estimator discussed in dlgh88 ( see also martinez et al . 1993 ) .",
    "altogether , this amounts to estimating @xmath25 through the following formula , that we use both for groups and galaxies : @xmath109 we adopt the same selection functions for galaxies and groups , by using both in pps1 and pps2 the luminosity function @xmath110 evaluated in tb96 from pps2 ( in some cases , we use also @xmath61 from dlgh88 ) .",
    "in fact , the radial distribution of galaxies and groups substantially agree over the relevant redshift range ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "errorbars are computed with 10 bootstrap resampling of the data ( barrow , bhavsar , & sonoda 1984 ) .",
    "bootstrap errors are expected to overestimate the true ensemble errors , in turn larger than formal poisson errors .",
    "the ratio between bootstrap and poisson errors is expected to be @xmath111@xmath112 ( martinez et al .",
    "1993 ) , with a slight dependence on @xmath96 and data depth .",
    "on the other hand , weighting data by @xmath113bootstrap errorbar@xmath114 in the least ",
    "squares fit of @xmath25 to @xmath115 , and simultaneously treating @xmath96-bins as independent , tends to compensate the bootstrap overestimate , yielding fair values for @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( e.g. , ling , frenk , & barrow 1986 ) .",
    "plots of 2point correlation functions for groups are given in figs .",
    "3a and b. for the sake of comparison , in each figure , the galaxy 2point functions are from the same sample also plotted . here ,",
    "groups are identified with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , as in rgh89 .",
    "bootstrap error bars are given for all points .",
    "a least  square bootstrap  weighted fit to @xmath120 is then performed .",
    "the best fit @xmath121 and @xmath122 and their errors are listed in tables 2 and 3 for pps1 and pps2 , respectively . for galaxies the fits can be extended from 1 to 31.7 @xmath4 . for groups , instead , the most reasonable distance interval is from 1.5 to 10 @xmath4 . for @xmath123 anti  correlation due to the intrinsical size of groups",
    "is expected to ( and does ) take over .",
    "the plots also show that , for @xmath124 the signal is too noisy to be of any use .",
    "this distance interval is similar to those used in previous group correlation analyses .",
    "we however performed fits both for galaxies and groups in both kinds of distance intervals .    from fig .",
    "3 we see that , although ( 1 ) within 2@xmath125 bootstrap errorbars , @xmath126 , ( 2 ) @xmath27 is mostly _ higher _ than @xmath127 by a factor @xmath128 .",
    "accordingly , from tables 2 and 3 , we see that @xmath0 systematically exceeds @xmath1 . for the narrower and most reliable distance range , @xmath129 for pps1 , and @xmath130@xmath131 for pps2 . in this",
    "parameter fit , the amplitudes are different at the @xmath1322.5@xmath125 level , but their difference has the same sign anywhere , and can be suspected to be real . also the slope @xmath122 of groups is however greater than the corresponding slope of galaxies .",
    "let us just remind that the range of @xmath122 s found here is not unusual in the redshift space and , for galaxies , corresponds to steeper @xmath133 s in the range @xmath134@xmath135 in the real space ( e.g. , gramann , cen , & bahcall 1993 ) .",
    "the shift from redshift to real space is clearly expected to be weaker for groups .",
    "it is not clear to which extent this can justify the steeper @xmath122 found for groups ; this effect exceeds 2@xmath125 s for pps1 only , but is present anywhere . with a comparable level of confidence",
    "we also see that : ( 3 ) @xmath0 for pps1 exceeds @xmath0 for pps2 by more than 50@xmath136 , while , in the same ( narrower ) distance range @xmath1 for pps1 and pps2 are almost consistent within 1@xmath125 .",
    "however , for galaxies , we can exploit the wider distance range , and there we find a probable signal of luminosity segregation at the 3@xmath125 level .",
    "the point ( 1 ) was also outlined by rgh90 in cfa2 slices , while the point ( 2 ) is in contrast with rgh90 , mdc89 , and jz88 .",
    "let us however remark that jz88 and mdc89 used much larger @xmath6 s than us and rgh90 .",
    "adopting the same links and @xmath8 parameters as for jz88 s groups ( gh83 ) , we obtain much lower and noisier @xmath27 s , both for pps1 and pps2 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  4a , where , at variance with jz88 , error bars are also provided . the discrepancy with rgh90 , instead",
    ", is less pronounced .",
    "besides of using a different data set , rgh90 make also use of different @xmath8 parameters .",
    "if we make use of such parameters to detect groups in pps2 we obtain a lower @xmath27 , nearly overlapping @xmath127 ( compare fig .",
    "3b and fig .",
    "4b ) .    an attractive interpretation of point ( 2 ) is a _ relative _ segregation of groups with respect to galaxies . a similar effect between halos and halo groups in n ",
    "body simulations of flat unbiased cdm ( gelb 1992 ) was found by f95 , who however showed that this result can depend on the identification scheme .",
    "although bearing in mind such reserves , we agree with f95 that rgh90 s outputs conflict with flat unbiased cdm models .",
    "however , this conflict is not evident in our outputs .    as already outlined , the obvious interpretation of the point ( 3 ) for galaxies is luminosity segregation : as first shown by davis et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and convincingly demonstrated by park et al .",
    "( 1994 ) using complete _ volume  limited _ samples , brighter galaxies are more clustered than fainter one .",
    "this can be related to their greater luminosity either directly ( e.g. , hamilton 1988 ; hollosi & efstathiou 1988 ; davis et al . 1988 ; gramann & einasto 1992 ) or through the luminosity  morphology connection ( e.g. , iovino et al . 1993 ; hasegawa & umemura 1993 ) .",
    "such effect is also predicted by theoretical scenarios ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "1987 ; bonometto & scaramella 1988 ; valls ",
    "gabaud , alimi , & blanchard 1989 ) and a similar effect of _ mass _ segregation has been found in large n ",
    "body simulations ( e.g. , campos et al . 1995 ) .    independently of the interpretation",
    ", it is clear that cutting both pps1 and pps2 within the _ same _ limit @xmath137 , pps1 contains all the brighter galaxies of pps2 because of the brighter @xmath7 .",
    "for these _ incomplete _ samples , limited both in @xmath59 and in @xmath138 , we expect @xmath127 to be greater for brighter @xmath7 . on the contrary , for _",
    "complete _ apparent  magnitude limited samples ( @xmath139 increasing with @xmath7 ) , we expect @xmath127 to be greater for fainter @xmath7 ( e.g. , hamilton 1988 ) , as the total number of intrinsically bright galaxies in such samples increases with fainter @xmath7 and dominates the sample .",
    "a possible interpretation of the point ( 3 ) for groups is that , in pps1 , we selected higher density contrast groups than in pps2 .",
    "in fact , using the same @xmath6 for both pps1 and pps2 , while the mean inter galaxy separation is smaller for fainter @xmath7 , can enhance the correlation in pps1 .",
    "but this effect might not be enough .",
    "in fact we checked that the change of @xmath6 in either pps1 or pps2 has smaller effects than passing from pps1 to pps2 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "5a and b , where we give @xmath27 for groups selected in 2 different ways both in pps1 and pps2 . using @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) in pps2 ( pps1 )",
    "we have the same @xmath142 that @xmath143 gives in pps1 ( pps2 ) .",
    "the changes of @xmath27 are however slight within either pps1 or pps2 , in spite of the change of @xmath6 .",
    "we explore further the dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath6 in fig .",
    "as expected , @xmath27 increases with @xmath142 within a given sample ( the figure refers to pps2 ) . in fig .",
    "5d , instead , we test the dependence on @xmath10 and discover that , at variance with what could be expected , @xmath27 does not depend on @xmath10 , in spite of varying the redshift link over a greater range than @xmath6 . as a further check",
    ", we also used the nw scaling recipe , whose @xmath9 has a quite different shape from the hg scaling ( @xmath5 s are very similar ) .",
    "no effect on @xmath27 is however present .",
    "( this agrees with f95 , and is consistent with tb96 who showed how for given self  consistent normalizations and different scaling recipes the spatial distribution of hg  like and",
    "nw  like groups is very similar . )",
    "it is difficult to comment on this point , which however seems to indicate that varying @xmath10 is not so effective to change the density contrast and that the redshift link is therefore less _ physical _ than the sky link .",
    "in fact , tb96 showed how a restrictive @xmath9 affect groups more as a cut  off ( discarding high  velocity  dispersion systems ) than as a systematic variation of the properties of each single group .",
    "on the other hand , changing @xmath5 directly affects @xmath142 of the otput groups . from a physical point of view",
    ", this might suggest that clustering of galaxy systems is more directly related to their density contrast than to their velocity dispersion ( mass ? ) .",
    "note that groups are on average brighter in pps1 than in pps2 ( tb96 ) .",
    "a natural interpretation of point ( 3 ) could be luminosity ( mass ? ) segregation among _ groups _ themselves . but",
    "this could be a premature conclusion .",
    "in fact , in order to compare group luminosity the _ observed _ group luminosity @xmath144 should be implemented by @xmath145 for group members below @xmath7 .",
    "but this correction depends on several assumptions ( mezzetti et al .",
    "1985 ; gourgoulhon , chamaraux , & fouqu 1992 ; moore et al .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath27 in pps1 could be just an effect of a higher correlation of group members .",
    "in fact , groups are brighter in pps1 than in pps2 because their _ members _ are .",
    "henceforth , luminosity segregation of _ galaxies _ , not of groups themselves",
    ".    however , fig .",
    "1 shows that the relatively nearby main ridge in pps at @xmath146 is equally well sampled in both pps1 and pps2 , while the more sparsely populated region between @xmath147 and @xmath148 in pps2 is completely devoid of groups in pps1 . from this point of view",
    ", groups _ are _ indeed more clustered in pps1 than in pps2 , but simply because of `` cosmographical '' reasons , not because of their higher luminosity . therefore , an explanation of effect ( 3 ) could be an intrinsic difference in the data sets pps1 and pps2 .",
    "previous analyses of group clustering ( jz88 , mdc90 , rgh90 ) led to apparently contradictory results .",
    "the main source of discrepancy lies in the different search parameters of the adaptive friends  of - friends algorithms adopted by various authors .",
    "the greater difference is due to the transverse normalization @xmath6 .",
    "stricter @xmath5 s yield stronger correlations , thus explaining the discrepancy among jz88 on one side ( @xmath149 ) and rgh90 on the other ( @xmath150 ) . instead , contrary to simple expectation , no dependence on the radial link @xmath9 ( as suggested by rgh90 ) is detected .",
    "a further reason of difference is the impact on group properties of the different depth of the adopted samples .",
    "this effect ( partially considered by rgh89 and mdcl89 , but not by rgh90 and mdc90 ) requires a suitable handling of the `` parameter '' @xmath7 in the identification algorithm , and a self  consistent normalization of @xmath5 . simply adopting the same value of @xmath6 leads to lower density contrasts in shallower samples , also contributing to the shallower @xmath27 of jz88 and mdc90 .",
    "the residual difference among samples of different depth is nevertheless more important .",
    "this is the case for the samples pps1 and pps2 , and an analogous effect was pointed out by rgh89 for cfa1 survey and cfa2 slices .",
    "a further reason of discrepancy between rgh90 and mdc90 could be the different physical nature of the cfa and ssrs samples . as shown by mdcl89 ,",
    "groups in cfa1 and ssrs1 have similar physical properties when _ different _ values of the links are used .",
    "in fact , the former survey contains a higher percentage of early  type galaxies , in general more clustered than the late  type galaxies in the latter .",
    "the attention devoted by a number of authors to the clustering of loose groups is widely justified .",
    "galaxies and clusters are both clustered , but their clustering parameters are different .",
    "the discovery of such difference was the original motivation to introduce the biased theory of galaxy formation .",
    "an independent test of such theory as a whole and a further constraint on its parameters arise from a sufficiently precise determination of clustering parameters of groups .",
    "to pursue this program we need an unambiguous definition of loose groups and a sample wide enough to test their properties . in the literature",
    "there has been a complex debate on group individuation , which is technically provided by suitable sky link ( @xmath5 ) and redshift link ( @xmath9 ) , in transverse and radial direction , respectively .",
    "this is due to the need of exploiting the whole information contained in apparent magnitude limited samples , and overcoming the critical problem of distortions due to the passage from the redshift to the real space .",
    "this work shows that results on clustering parameters , obtained with different group individuation recipes , are essentially consistent .",
    "this does not mean that the values of the links do not matter .",
    "on the contrary , the clustering strength is critically dependent on how restrictive the selection is .",
    "the point is that @xmath5 has a stronger impact on clustering properties than @xmath9 .",
    "different criteria ( e.g. , nw vs. hg ) are essentially different as far as the radial link @xmath9 is concerned , but the effect on @xmath25 of fairly wide variations of @xmath9 is neglegible , while smaller variations of @xmath5 are reflected on the clustering of groups .    to some extent , this is a natural outcome of working in _",
    "redshift space_. the transverse link @xmath5 is directly related to the spatial separation among group members . in the radial direction , instead , peculiar velocities inside groups yield ambiguous apparent separations .",
    "relating @xmath9 to a value of @xmath151 is then not trivial and depends on the cosmological model ( e.g. , nw87 ) .",
    "this problem would be present even if we could select a complete volume  limited galaxy sample , and then identify groups therein as suggested by ramella et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) .",
    "( selecting volume  limited subsamples of the group catalogs _",
    "after _ group identification with the adaptive hg and nw algorithms ( zabludoff et al .",
    "1993a , b ) , is not the ideally correct solution , as groups could be already biased by the magnitude  limited nature of the galaxy data source . ) unfortunately , to be really efficient , this procedure requires a high number of measured redshifts . @xmath152 , even adopting the _ generous _ constant links @xmath153 , @xmath154 , volume limiting pps2 to @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) as in guzzo et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and bonometto et al .",
    "( 1993 ) yields only @xmath157 groups , and it is not sure that this is enough .    resorting then to _ apparent  magnitude  limited _ samples ,",
    "two further but connected source of complication arise .",
    "first , the physical mixture of what we consider _ bright _ and _ faint _ galaxies varies with redshift .",
    "second , the mean separation among observed galaxies grows with @xmath59 , and group identification is harder at higher redshifts .",
    "to some extent , the traditional strategy of compensating the decrease of galaxy density by scaling up @xmath5 and @xmath9 , gives group properties doomed to be systematically dependent on @xmath59 ( and , to a lesser extent , to the scaling recipe and galaxy luminosity function ) .",
    "previous analyses of group clustering ( jz88 , mdc90 , rgh90 ) in cfa and ssrs surveys led to apparently contradictory results . in this paper , we have investigated the source of such discrepancies , finding satisfactory explanations for them .",
    "together with that , we have found a signal of group clustering , whose amplitude exceeds the amplitude of galaxy clustering .",
    "such excess is perhaps to be trusted more than what its formal probability ( @xmath158 s ) prescribes , as it persists through various density contrasts and link recipes ; it could be found mostly thanks to the wider extension of pps in respect to the sample used for previous analyses .      & & & & tb96@xmath159 & 0.27 & 350 & 160,110 & 48 , 192 & & & & wide@xmath56 & 0.30 & 350 & 110 , ... & 48 , ...",
