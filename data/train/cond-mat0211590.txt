    "since the experiments revealed the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the order parameter in cuprate superconductors  @xcite , the physics of low - energy quasiparticle excitations in disordered two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath0-wave superconductors has been a subject of ongoing intensive research  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the @xmath2-wave pairing state is the existence of four nodal points where the order parameter vanishes . in the vicinity of the gap nodes there",
    "exist low - lying dirac - type quasiparticle excitations .",
    "an understanding of the disorder effect induced by randomly - distributed impurities on these low - energy states is essential for the elucidation of the thermodynamic and transport properties of disordered @xmath0-wave superconductors . during the years",
    "a number of theoretical approaches , such as the self - consistent approximation schemes  [ 39 ] , non - perturbative methods  [ 1017 ] , and numerical studies  [ 18 - 22 ] , have been developed to calculate the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) in the presence of disorder .",
    "unfortunately , many of these theories contradict each other .",
    "the dos at zero energy was variously predicted to be finite  [ 310 ] , vanishing  [ 1114,18,21 ] , and divergent  [ 15,20 ] .",
    "recently , it has been made clear that  [ 16,17,19,22 ] much of this controversy roots in the fact that the @xmath0-wave superconductor is fundamentally sensitive to the details of disorder , as well as to certain symmetries of the normal state hamiltonian .    in order to clarify the physics of the various asymptotic results for the dos , yashenkin et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the diffusive modes in disordered @xmath0-wave superconductors and calculated the weak - localization correction to the dos with the diagrammatic technique .",
    "it is well known that the weak localization in electron systems is a manifestation of the quantum interference ( qi ) effect , which stems from the existence of the goldstone modes ( cooperon and diffuson )  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by altland and zirnbauer  @xcite , the goldstone modes in a superconductor have different features from those in a normal metal , for the local particle - hole symmetry of the superconducting state gives rise to a combination of impurity- and andreev - scattering processes . as a result",
    ", every cooperon or diffuson mode in the retarded - advanced ( ra ) channel entails a corresponding mode in the retarded - retarded ( rr ) or advanced - advanced ( aa ) channel . in the combined limit of the unitarity and nested fermi surface ( the un limit ) ,",
    "each of these @xmath3-mode cooperon and diffuson has a @xmath4-mode counterpart due to the global particle - hole symmetry  @xcite .",
    "for disordered @xmath0-wave superconductors , it was found  @xcite that in generic situations the quasiparticle dos is subject to a logarithmic weak - localization correction due to the 0-mode cooperon , and the existence of diffusive @xmath4-modes can give rise to a finite , or even divergent zero - energy dos upon approaching the un limit .",
    "the weak - localization calculations carried out by yashenkin et al . appear to capture the physical origin of the discrepancies between predicted low - energy quasiparticle dos .",
    "furthermore , the quasiparticle weak - localization effect was also suggested to have important influences on transport properties such as the electrical  @xcite , spin  @xcite , thermal  @xcite , and optical  @xcite conductivities of @xmath0-wave superconductors .",
    "while the qi effects have been widely investigated for disordered normal metals  @xcite , a corresponding theory for random dirac fermions in superconducting cuprates is far from well established , and thus highly deserves further development .",
    "this paper presents an intensive study of the qi effect on the quasiparticle dos in 2d @xmath0-wave superconductors with dilute nonmagnetic impurities both near the born and near the unitary limits .",
    "these two limiting cases are considered to be closely related with the disorder effects in cuprate superconductors .",
    "it is reasonable that the disorder due to defects off the copper - oxygen plane may be treated in the born approximation and that defects in the plane may be in the unitary limit  @xcite .",
    "albeit sharing certain aspects with ref .",
    "@xcite , we further develop the weak - localization theory in @xmath0-wave superconductors , and obtain some new results in this paper .",
    "first , the expressions of the goldstone modes for quasiparticle diffusion are derived in details both near the born and near the unitary limits .",
    "second , we calculate the additional contributions to the dos from those lowest - order self - energy diagrams containing non - singular ladders , which were not taking into account previously . these diagrams are shown to give rise to various renormalization factors for the dos correction in the born and unitary limits .",
    "third , by taking into account a new nontrivial self - energy diagram with the @xmath4-mode diffuson , we show that the qi correction to the dos becomes a @xmath1-function of the energy upon approaching the un limit .",
    "this result can be used to account for the resonant peak found by the previous numerical studies  @xcite .",

    "it is worthy to point out that the values of the impurity potential @xmath21 driving the system into these two limits are dependent on the band structure .",
