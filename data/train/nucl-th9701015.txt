    "the exchange of mesons between nucleons in a nucleus , which is the mechanism responsible for the nucleon  nucleon interaction , modifies the electromagnetic interactions of the nucleus in order to maintain the current conservation .",
    "this obvious statement was pointed out by siegert  @xcite soon after the exchange model of the nuclear forces was proposed by yukawa  @xcite . the realization that this exchange could produce non  negligible effects on nuclear observables , such as the nuclear magnetic moments , preceeded the discovery of the pion  @xcite .    nevertheless , it was in the early 70 s when this topic started to be of general interest .",
    "the reason for that lied in the increasing amount of experimental data of enough accuracy which begun to be available at that time .",
    "the first clear evidence of the importance of the so  called meson  exchange currents ( mec ) was identified in connection with the radiative thermal neutron capture reaction by a proton  @xcite .",
    "after this , processes such as the deuteron electrodisintegration at threshold  @xcite and the radiative neutron capture by the deuteron  @xcite and observables such as the magnetic form factors of @xmath1h and @xmath1he  @xcite could be explained both qualitative and quantitatively only after the consideration of mec contributions .",
    "most of the work done since that time has been devoted to the investigation of the contributions of mec to electromagnetic processes .",
    "these contributions have been studied in a wide range of momentum transfers , from the ground state to excitation energies corresponding the quasi ",
    "elastic ( qe ) peak and beyond , for light , medium and heavy nuclei and using quite different models to describe the nuclear structure . sizeable effects have been found in a number of situations , mainly in @xmath2 nuclei . in medium and heavy nuclei ,",
    "mec produce rather small effects what has been linked to the absence of short  range correlations of tensor type in the models commonly used to describe the wave functions of these nuclei .",
    "@xcite    the reason of the focussing on multipole transitions involving the nuclear current only is related to the siegert theorem  @xcite which establish that , at low momentum transfer , charge form factors are insensitive to meson exchange effects and that they can be reasonably well described by the single nucleon ( impulse ) approximation",
    ". however , siegert theorem only applies in the long wavelength limit and it is possible to find situations in which also these form factors are modified by the presence of exchange effects .    in principle , and this can also be applied to transverse form factors , meson exchange contributions will be relatively bigger the larger the momentum transfer is .",
    "however , at high-@xmath3 other effects such as relativistic effects or short  range correlations enter into play and make difficult a clear discrimination of the different contributions .",
    "therefore the only way to study meson exchange effects is to look at some relatively small value of @xmath3 where the contributions of the single ",
    "nucleon operators vanish accidentally .",
    "this is what happens in some of the processes above mentioned and this can also occur , and in fact it does , for charge form factors even at relatively low momentum transfer .    the first time that pion ",
    "exchange was recognized as responsible of a sizeable effect in nuclear charge form factors was in 1974 when kloet and tjon  @xcite calculated the charge form factors of the @xmath1h and @xmath1he .",
    "basically it was impossible to atteint the agreement with the experimental data in the second maximum using single ",
    "nucleon charge operator , even with relativistic wave functions .",
    "additional calculations in light nuclei such as the deuteron  @xcite and @xmath4he  @xcite showed similar results .    in heavier nuclei",
    "the situation is more complicated because of the incertitudes due to the nuclear structure problem .",
    "the presence of many single ",
    "particle orbitals hides to some extent the signature of mec effects and one should be careful with the conclusions drawn in this direction . in any case some calculations have been done in which those contributions are investigated .",
    "radomski and riska  @xcite have evaluated the pion ",
    "exchange effect in nuclear charge form factors and charge distributions of @xmath5o and @xmath6ca and have found smaller contributions than for the @xmath7particle . on the other hand , negele and riska  @xcite",
    "have shown that the inclusion of the pion ",
    "exchange term in the charge operator brings calculated charge form factors into better agreement with the experiment for closed ",
    "shell nuclei troughout the periodic table .",
    "riska and strve  @xcite have calculated the charge form factors again for the same nuclei , paying attention to the role of mec contributions in connection with medium polarization corrections and short  range effects .",
    "finally , lodhi and hamilton  @xcite have investigated the charge form factor of @xmath8li by considering mec and short  range correlations , simultaneously . despite the fact that in refs .",
    "@xcite a simple harmonic oscillator shell model has been used , the results can be considered as feasible because no important differences are found when these results are compared with those obtained with hartree ",
    "fock  @xcite or brueckner  hartree ",
    "fock  @xcite wave functions .    in any case",
    ", not much work has been done in this context . in this paper , we want to investigate the mec contributions to the nuclear charge operator in a variety of situations involving electromagnetic excitations of medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "the main purpose is to understand how such contributions affect the results one obtains by means of the impulse approximation ( ia ) , which is the one widely admitted to calculate the different observables in this sector .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "shell nuclei both in a shell  model approach and in a more realistic calculation performed in the framework of the random  phase approximation ( rpa ) .",

    "our purpose is to calculate different observables corresponding to the electron scattering by nuclei , such as cross  sections , form factors , response functions , etc . to do that it is necessary to fix both the model for the electromagnetic operator and the nuclear structure approach to be considered to describe the nuclear states . in this section",

    "exchange term dominates by more than one order of magnitude until @xmath58  @xmath59 where the @xmath60 starts to be the leading one . in heavier nuclei",
    "the situation is similar  @xcite and the modifications introduced by the nuclear medium in these nuclei only change slightly the results one obtains with the bare pion exchange term alone  @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we analyze the role of the mec contribution to the charge operator of eq .",
    "[ mecch ] in different electron scattering processes involving medium and heavy nuclei . until now , the cases investigated have been the charge form factors of different nuclei such as @xmath5o and @xmath6ca  @xcite and @xmath8li  @xcite and the charge densities of closed ",
    "shell nuclei throughout the periodic table  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of these contributions allow , in the first case , the description of some of the diffraction minima in the charge form factor and , in the second , a better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to say that , in all the cases , the effect is rather small .",
    "we want to analyze if the same conclusion can be drawn when nuclear excitation is considered .",
    "the first situation we analyze concerns with the qe peak . in this energy region ,",
    "the main problem deals with the longitudinal , @xmath61 , and transverse @xmath62 responses , which are related to the cross  section in the following way : @xmath63 .\\ ] ] here @xmath64 is the four  momentum transferred to the nucleus , @xmath65 is the scattering angle and @xmath66 is the mott cross  section , @xmath67 the response functions @xmath61 y @xmath62 are given in terms of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear charge and current operators discussed above , between the ground state , @xmath68 , and final states , @xmath69 , of the nucleus : @xmath70    as it is well known , these cross  sections can be described by means of a simple fermi gas model in a very good way  @xcite .",
    "however , once the separation of the two responses is performed , it can be realized that neither the fermi gas model nor more sophisticated approaches predict the experimental results : the longitudinal response is usually overestimated , while the transverse one is underestimated  @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms have been considered to solve this problem ( 2p2h configurations , final state interactions , relativistic effects , etc . ) , but though the situation of the longitudinal response is more or less understood , the same does not occurs for the transverse , where the inclusion of the mec is not sufficient to bring theory and experiment into full agreement .",
    "what we want to investigate is the role of @xmath71 in the longitudinal response . to do that we consider the fermi gas model to describe the nucleus . in this model ,",
    "the longitudinal response can be written as @xmath72 where the second term ( the interference one ) gives the larger contribution of mec , the last being negligible .",
    "the details of the calculation of this response for one particle ",
    "one hole ( 1p1h ) final states are given in appendix  a.    in our calculations we assume symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "as shown in eq .",
    "( a.1 ) of appendix  a , the important point is that the contribution of the interference between the ia and the mec contributions to the charge response is negative .",
    "the effect of adding this term to the ia longitudinal response is then to reduce it , an effect which goes in the direction of reaching the experimental data .",
    "now we evaluate the extent of such reduction .",
    "first we calculate the responses for the fermi momentum of nuclear matter ( @xmath73  mev/@xmath74 ) for different nuclei of closed ",
    "shell nuclei and for three values of the momentum transfer . to measure the effect of the mec we analyze the relative contribution @xmath75 table  1 shows the values obtained at the peak position in each case .",
    "it can be seen that the addition of mec contributions only produce a small reduction of the ia response , no larger of 3% .    in any case , it is important to note ( see fig .",
    "1 ) that the response @xmath76 ( long  dashed lines ) presents its maxima at lower energies than @xmath77 ( short  dashed lines ) and @xmath61 ( solid lines ) : 40  mev for @xmath78 and 400  mev/@xmath74 and 80  mev for @xmath79  mev/@xmath74 . this implies a certain dependence of these mec effects with the excitation energy .    in fig .",
    "2 we show ( solid lines ) the results obtained for the @xmath80parameter as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "the curves correspond to the different nuclei analyzed and , at the scale of the figure , are overlapping .",
    "thus , it is apparent that the effect does not depend on the nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of mec is a small correction to the ia response and only for small energies and high momentum transfer @xmath80 reach values of the order of a 10% .",
    "the results just quoted have been obtained for @xmath73  mev/@xmath74 .",
    "a second aspect of interest is the possible dependence of the mec effects with the values of the fermi momentum .",
    "as it is well known , the fermi gas model has been used to describe the qe response of finite nuclei by readjusting the value of @xmath81 to adequate values  @xcite .",
    "these values can be obtained by averaging the fermi momentum with the density  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted also the @xmath80parameter calculated for @xmath82c ( dashed  dotted lines ) and @xmath6ca ( dashed lines ) , for the three momentum transfer considered and for @xmath83 and 235  mev/@xmath74 , respectively .",
    "this particular values are those provided by the procedure mentioned above .",
    "as we can see , the consideration of the new @xmath81 values reduces the effect of the mec and the modification of the ia longitudinal response is , at the peak energies , negligible in practice .",
    "the general trends pointed out for the nuclear matter fermi momentum are still valid .",
    "the main conclusion one can draw is that , though a reduction of the one  body longitudinal response in the qe peak occurs after adding the mec contribution to the charge operator , it does not produce a sizeable effect .",
    "the smallness of these mec contributions is due to the fact that the charge response is dominated by the proton excitations , which are by far considerably large .",
    "as noted in the introduction , mec effects were seen in cases were the ia term is negligible and this is not the case of the qe region .",
    "besides , the precision of the data , clearly worst than those of the charge distributions quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , makes not necessary the consideration of these mec effects in the calculation of such responses .",
    "the possibility of considering giant resonances to look for this mec effect is not reasonable because of the difficulties inherent to this energy region in what refers to the nuclear structure . besides , from the point of view of the dominant transitions , the mixing of different multipolarities at any energy is similar to that observed in the qe peak and one can expect the corresponding electromagnetic cross ",
    "sections to be only slightly affected by the presence of this term in the charge operator .",
    "low energy transitions offer , at least in principle , much more opportunities in order to investigate the modifications of the charge nuclear operator induced by mec , because of the capacity for selecting transitions with given characteristics . in what follows we focus on these transitions . in order to minimize at most the uncertitudes associated to the nuclear structure",
    ", we will consider closed ",
    "shell nuclei .",
    "we study the process of the electroexcitation of low energy levels .",
    "the corresponding cross section is given by  @xcite @xmath84 , \\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the nuclear charge , @xmath86 is the recoil factor , @xmath87 with @xmath88 the target nucleus mass , and @xmath89 i d the four  momentum transfers .",
    "the longitudinal , @xmath90 , and transverse , @xmath91 , form factors include the information relative to the nuclear structure . in the case of closed ",

    "taking into account the model of the nuclear charge given by eqs .",
    "( [ ch ] ) and ( [ mecch ] ) , the longitudinal form factor , the one we are interested in , can be written as : @xmath103      first we study the closed ",
    "shell nuclei in the framework of the extreme shell  model , in which the excited levels are described as 1p1h states .",
    "the reduced electromagnetic matrix elements @xmath104 in this approximation are given by eq .",
    "( b.2 ) in appendix  b.    the evaluation of these reduced matrix elements requires to fix the corresponding configuration space . in this work",
    "we have used a phenomenological woods ",
    "saxon potential to generate the single  particle states and energies of the nuclei considered .",
    "this potential is as follows : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the coulomb potential generated by a uniform spherical distribution with radius @xmath107 .",
    "the parameters of this potential are adjusted in order to reproduce the single particle energies of the levels around the fermi level and the root mean squared charge radius of the corresponding closed  shell nuclei .",
    "table  2 shows the values used in this work .",
    "the first question we want to analyze is the behaviour of @xmath71 depending on the isospin of the transition . to do that we have calculated the longitudinal form factor for the @xmath5o and @xmath6ca nuclei and the transitions to levels with the low excitation energies ( see table  3 )",
    "the fact that in both cases @xmath108 permits a direct comparison of the results obtained for protonic and neutronic transitions with the same quantum numbers .",
    "these are drawn in fig .  3 and 4 .",
    "therein it is apparent that the curves including the two  body term ( solid curves ) are considerably modified with respect to those calculated with @xmath109 ( dashed curves ) in the case of transition of neutronic type , even at low momentum transfers .",
    "the effect of the mec in protonic transitions are much smaller .",
    "this situation is shown in table  4 , where we give the values of the factor @xmath110 obtained , in each case , at the scattering maximum with larger strength .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath111 term dominates the longitudinal form factor in some cases of neutronic character , while the effects are practically negligible for protonic transitions .",
    "however , these two nuclei are not expected to present purely neutronic transitions .",
    "the similitude between the energies of the 1p1h configurations for protons and neutrons suggests actual excited states composed by a strong mixing of these configurations . as a consequence , the large difference in the strength of @xmath112 for both types of transitions ( three orders of magnitude in @xmath5o and two in @xmath6ca ) will hide the effects of the mec charge operator .",
    "the idea is then to look for nuclei in which there exist excitations dominated by neutronic 1p1h configurations .",
    "this occurs for nuclei with neutron excess . in the case of",
    "shell nuclei , @xmath113ca is the first one with this property . in what follows",
    "we analyze this nucleus and , in addition , we study the @xmath0pb .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained for both nuclei will provide us a good information on the question we are discussing .      in this nucleus , the subshell @xmath114 is filled for neutrons and empty for protons .",
    "this situation favours the appearance of excited states predominantly neutronic at low energy and with low multipolarity .",
    "table  5 shows the final states of 1p1h type that can be built in the extreme shell model approach .",
    "as can be seen , the presence of the multipolarities @xmath115 and @xmath116 for both protons and neutrons with similar energies , reveals again the large mixing one can expect for these multipolarities in the actual excited states , and we have not considered them here .",
    "on the other hand , the multipolarities with parity plus are only possible for excitations of neutronic type .",
    "this is the type of levels we are interested in . besides we have considered the @xmath117 and the @xmath118 levels . in the first case ,",
    "its high  spin character reduces the 1p1h configurations allowed . in the second one ,",
    "the expected mixing should maintain a certain degree of purity because of the energy differences ( @xmath119  mev ) between the corresponding 1p1h permitted .",
    "the results obtained for the longitudinal form factors are plotted in fig .",
    "5 . as in the previous cases ,",
    "it is evident how the effect of adding the mec term is completely negligible in the case of protonic transitions while appreciable modifications of the one  body results are observed for transition to some neutronic final states .    in order to quantify these effects",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath80factor , as given by eq .",
    "( [ rela1 ] ) , for the scattering maxima with larger @xmath112 in the different transitions .",
    "the results obtained are shown in table  6 .",
    "the main aspect to be noted is that the values for @xmath80 are now considerably smaller than for @xmath6ca .",
    "however , the fact that some of the actual excitations in this nucleus are dominated by neutron 1p1h configurations , makes it still particularly interesting .",
    "another point to be noted is the fact that the transition to the @xmath120 shows a 8% effect , a value notably bigger that those obtained for @xmath5o and @xmath6ca .    in order to elucidate",
    "if some feasible consequence can be extracted from the results obtained for this nucleus , more realistic calculations , such as , e.g. , rpa , are needed .",
    "nevertheless , we analyze the case of @xmath0pb before going to this point .      in this nucleus",
    "the levels of interest are the high  spin states . at low energy the excited states with",
    "low angular momentum show a great collectivity and then the mec effects can not be observed without ambiguities .",
    "high  spin states do not present this problem because of the reduced possibilities of coupling . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding wave functions are dominated by only a few ( one or two at most in many cases ) 1p1h configurations and are ideal for the study we are carrying out .",
    "the states of this type which have been investigated in deep are those of magnetic character . from its discovery  @xcite",
    "they have been considered to analyze some aspects related to the nuclear structure ( partial occupation of single  particle levels  @xcite , the role of 2p2h configurations  @xcite , the effective residual interaction  @xcite , ... ) or , even , to determine the mec effects  @xcite .    however , there exist also  @xcite electric states of this type , which are those we want to study here . in table  7",
    "the configurations giving rise to these states in the shell  model are shown .",
    "as in the case of @xmath113ca , the possibilities of coupling of protonic configurations are strongly restricted . on the other hand , the proximity in the excitation energies predicts the mixing of 1p1h configurations in the realistic wave functions and this will permit to study situations slightly different to those seen in the previous cases . in particular , it is interesting to point out the cases of the @xmath121 states .",
    "6 shows the results corresponding to the transitions with @xmath122 . in table  8",
    "we have included the values of the @xmath80factor at the maxima of @xmath123 with larger strength .",
    "it can be seen how the inclusion of @xmath124 produce notable effects in some of the neutronic transitions .",
    "also , it is worth to point out that , again , we find a protonic transition , the one with final state @xmath125 , with a considerably high @xmath80value .",
    "the results quoted in this section deserve some comments with respect to the regularities they show and which are of interest .",
    "the first point , above noted , is the considerable difference between the relative effects of the mec in the transitions of protonic and neutronic character .",
    "this is obviously due to the smallnes of the one  body contribution in the neutron case . in any case",
    ", it has been observed some transitions of protonic character for which @xmath80 is larger than the 3% observed in the quasi ",
    "elastic peak .",
    "a second characteristic shown by the results is the reduction of the mec effects as the multipolarity grows .",
    "this can be observed in those cases where various multipolarities are accesible to the same 1p1h configuration ( see the results quoted in tables  4 , 6 and 8) .",
    "then , the advantage that a priori constitues the consideration of , e.g. , the high  spin states in order both to select those of neutronic character and to minimize the number of possible 1p1h configurations contributing to the wave functions could disappear be elliminated because of the experimental inability to detect the effects we are looking for .",
    "finally , a third aspect which must be pointed out is the strong variation between the mec contributions corresponding to the two possible couplings permitted , for a given multipolarity , by the two single  particle states with same orbital angular momentum @xmath126 .",
    "this situation can be observed in different cases .",
    "for example , the transitions to the levels @xmath127 in @xmath113ca , ( see table  6 and fig .  8) show mec effects apreciably bigger for the single  particle state @xmath128 than for the @xmath129 .",
    "same occurs in @xmath0pb ( see table  8 and fig .",
    "9 ) with the transitions to the @xmath130 and @xmath131 , where the relative variation due to the mec is larger for the single  particle states @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "once we have analyze the basic aspects of the @xmath71 operator by means of the shell  model , it is interesting to go deeper and study more realistic situations which permit the experimental identification of these effects or the determination of the conditions in which it is necessary or not to incorporate this operator to the model . to do that , and taking into account the characteristics of the nuclei we are considering , we will investigate the properties of the mec contributions to the charge operator in the rpa framework .",
    "this approach represent one of the procedures mostly used to describe the structure of closed  shell nuclei . in this approximation ,",
    "the nuclear levels are given in terms of linear combinations of 1p1h states which are obtained by acting with the pair p ",
    "h creation and anihilation operators on the correlated vaccum @xmath134 : @xmath135^j_m - ( -1)^{j_p+j_h+m } y_j(ph ) [ b_h \\otimes a_p ] ^j_{-m } \\right\\ } | c \\rangle .\\ ] ] here @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) and @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) are the particle and hole creation ( anihilation ) operators , respectively and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the rpa amplitudes .",
    "these are calculated by solving the rpa equations which involve the matrix elements of the residual interaction .",
    "our calculations have been performed using a residual interaction of landau  migdal .",
    "this is a zero  range interaction of the form @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the nucleon density and the parameters ( see table  9 ) have been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite with the change of @xmath144 from 0.55 to 0 , a more realistic value for this type of interaction  @xcite . in any case",
    "it should be mentioned that the channels @xmath144 y @xmath145 do not affect to much the calculation of electric states .    in figs .",
    "10 and 11 we show the spectra obtained in our calculations for @xmath113ca and @xmath0pb . only the levels of interest for our study have been included for an easier analysis . as it can be seen , the calculation is reasonnable for lead , despite the scarcity of data . on the other hand ,",
    "the results are not satisfactory for calcium , what indicates the necessity of a more adequate interaction , in this case .",
    "this aspect is out of the purpose of this work and we will use the same interaction in both nuclei .",
    "once the excited states wave functions are determined , the reduced matrix elements are evaluated as given by eq .",
    "the single  particle wave functions needed for this calculation have been generated with the same woods ",
    "saxon potential used in the case of the shell  model .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath80factor for the two nuclei we are studying are summarized in tables  10 and 11 .    in the case of @xmath113ca ( see tables  6 and 10 ) it can be stated that the results are similar to those observed in the shell  model calculations , though the configuration mixing produced by the rpa reduces considerably the mec effects in most cases .",
    "it is worth to point out the transitions to the @xmath117 at 8.95  mev and @xmath118 at 8.99  mev and 11.03  mev , which are the only in which mec effects are above 5% . in the three cases ( see fig .  9 ) the corresponding transverse form factors ( right pannels ) take values of the same order as the longitudinal ones ( left pannels ) , what could permit their separation and empirical determination . in this figure ,",
    "solid ( dashed ) curves have been obtained with ( without ) the inclusion of mec . in the transverse form factor the model for",
    "the current we have considered includes the seagull and pionic terms discussed in sect .  2 .",
    "we can conclude that , in this case , the study of @xmath118 levels and the search of the @xmath117 could permit to go deeper in the investigation of the role of the mec corrections to the nuclear charge in this nucleus .",
    "however , the relatively unsatisfactory results quoted above with respect to the residual interaction used , needs of a more detailed study of this aspect . work in this direction is in progress  @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath0pb is quite different . though the rpa calculation produce a reduction of the relative effects of mec , as it is apparent from figs .",
    "9 and 13 , such a reduction is not so pronounced as in @xmath113ca .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath80 shown in table  11 favour this conclusion .",
    "in particular , the transitions to the @xmath146 at 6.54  mev , @xmath147 at 6.55  mev and @xmath121 at 7.22  mev states , all of them with a dominant component of neutronic character , are still showing an appreciable influence of @xmath71 .",
    "besides , the transition to the @xmath146 at 7.24  mev state maintain the @xmath80value found for its dominant configuration which is of protonic type .    on the other hand , and as it can be seen in fig .",
    "10 , the longitudinal ( left pannels ) and transverse ( right pannels ) form factors for these four cases show similar order of magnitude and this makes the separation of both form factors experimentally feasible .",
    "the importance of the configuration mixing produced by the rpa is evident in the results we have just discussed .",
    "it can be seen in tables  10 and 11 that when the dominant configuration contributes to the wave function with an amplitude @xmath148 $ ] far from the value 1 ( that is , when the mixing is stronger ) , the reduction of the @xmath80factor is considerable .",
    "this corroborates the comments made in the case of the quasi ",
    "elastic peak and indicates in a clear way that the mec effects we are analyzing will be important only when the wave function of the excited level is sufficiently pure and , preferably , of neutronic character .",
    "these are the cases in which the @xmath71 operator must be included in the calculations .",
    "in this work , the corrections introduced by the mec in the nuclear charge operator have been analyzed in nuclear electroexcitation processes at different energy regions .    in the quasi ",
    "elastic peak , the effect of these contributions produces a diminution of the longitudinal response .",
    "though this goes in the direction of the experimental results , the reduction is of the order of a 3% only at the peak energy , and then it is insufficient to provide the agreement with the data . taking into account the incertitudes introduced in the longitudinal response by the nucleon form factors and the experimental error , we can conclude that the inclusion of @xmath71 in the calculations at these energies is irrelevant at present .    at low energy , mec effects in the longitudinal form factor",
    "result to be relatively important in some cases .",
    "calculations performed in the extreme shell  model point out the strong asymmetry of such contributions depending on the isospin of the transition : they are considerably larger in case of neutronic excitations",
    ".    on the other hand , the results obtained with calculations of rpa type reduce the mec effects due to the configuration mixing generated .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to found situations in which the consideration of the @xmath71 operator is mandatory .",
    "some of the observed aspects could be amplified if processes including polarization degrees of freedom and involving closed  shell nuclei @xmath149 nucleon are used .",
    "in previous works  @xcite it has been shown how the selection of the target polarization axis together to an adequate kinematics allow the appearance of big effects due to the mec contributions to the current operator . in view of the fact",
    "that , as seen above , the effects in the charge ( longitudinal ) channel are of the same order as those in the tranverse one , the mentioned processes could be specially sensible to the presence of @xmath71 .    in order to finish ,",
    "it is worth to note that the previous discussions have a fundamental point of incertitude .",
    "the fact that the most relevant aspects are associated to neutronic transitions makes the electric form factor of the neutron to be one of the basic ingredients .",
    "however , the poor experimental determination of this form factor give rise to large differences between the different parametrizations available , what introduces ambiguities in the calculations of difficult evaluation .",
    "the reduction of the experimental error for the neutron electric form factor is then a basic point to bring our conclusions to a feasible practical level . in this sense ,",
    "the experimental program to be developped at cebaf is of maximum interest . on the oppposite side , the careful selection of some particular transitions ( such as , e.g. that to the @xmath147 state in @xmath0pb ) and the experimental separation of the two form factors could provide some alternative insight in the problem of the values of this form factor .",
    "in this appendix we describe the key points for the calculation of the interferece response between the @xmath71 operator and the ia charge one in the fermi gas model we have considered to analyze the quasi  elastic peak region .    assuming final states of 1p1h type , this interferencen term can be written as : @xmath150 where @xmath81 is the fermi momentum .",
    "here we have used k to label the single  particle state @xmath151 which is characterized by a momemtum * k * , with @xmath152 , an energy @xmath153 and third spin and isospin components @xmath154 and @xmath155 , respectively .",
    "taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ ch ] ) and ( [ mecch ] ) , a simple calculation gives for the response of interest : @xmath156 where k runs over all occupied single ",
    "particle states , @xmath157 and @xmath158 represents the reduced transverse response corresponding to the interference between the magnetization and seagull currents ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . for symmetric nuclear matter , the interference response simplifies to : @xmath159 f_1^s({\\bf q},\\omega )   \\right . \\eqno({\\rm",
    "a}.1)\\ ] ] @xmath160 f_1^v({\\bf q},\\omega ) \\right\\ } { \\cal r}^{\\rm ms}({\\bf q},\\omega ) .\\ ] ]",
    "in this appendix we give the expressions of the reduced matrix elements of the coulomb operator which enter in the calculation of the longitudinal form factor .    in describing closed ",
    "shell nuclei in the rpa framework , the nuclear wave functions are given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) . with this definition , and after a cumbersome calculation involving angular momentum algebra , the reduced matrix elements involved in the longitudinal form factor can be written as follows : @xmath161 ( -1)^{j_p-1/2 } \\xi ( l_p+l_h+j )   \\eqno({\\rm b}.1)\\ ] ] @xmath162 where @xmath163 or 0 according to @xmath164 be even or odd , @xmath165 and the functions @xmath166 are : @xmath167 here @xmath168 runs over all the single nucleon states below the fermi level , @xmath169 , @xmath170 \\nonumber \\\\        & + & f_1^v(q)[\\delta_{phi,\\nu}-\\delta_{phi,\\pi}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath171    we are also interested in describing the nuclear states in the extreme shell  model . in this case , the excited levels a of 1p1h character and are given as : @xmath172^j_m | 0 \\rangle , \\ ] ] with @xmath173 the hartree  fock vacuum . in this approach , the reduced matrix element of eq .",
