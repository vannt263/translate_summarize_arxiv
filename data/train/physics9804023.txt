    "despite the early theoretical prediction of its existence @xcite , the ps@xmath0 molecule has not been experimentally found to date .",
    "the difficulty stems from the fact that this system is neutral and therefore it can not be separated from the positronium atoms ( ps ) and its primary decay mode , the annihilation by two - photon emission , is exactly the same as that of the ps atom .",
    "the energy of the photons arising from the annihilation is different in principle : the photons carry 1.02 mev energy due to the annihilation plus the binding energy of the corresponding system .",
    "the binding - energy difference is , however , less than 1 ev and adding it to 1.02 mev , the energy of the photons coming from the ps atom or ps@xmath0 molecule can not be experimentally distinguished . the experimental observation of the biexcitons can be considered as an indirect indication of the existence of ps@xmath0 .    in our recent letter",
    "@xcite we have predicted the existence of a hitherto unknown bound excited - state of the ps@xmath0 molecule . in this paper",
    "we give a detailed description of this state .",
    "we have investigated possible decay modes of this state with a special emphasis on the electric dipole ( @xmath3 ) transition to the ground state .",
    "it will be shown that the probability of the @xmath3 transition is comparable to that of the annihilation . the unique energy of this transition may possibly be utilized as a sign for the experimental identification of the ps@xmath0 molecule .    the stochastic variational method @xcite has been used to solve the coulomb four - body problem . in this method",
    "the variational trial functions are optimized by gambling : randomly chosen configurations are probed and most adequate functions are selected to be the basis states .",
    "the correlated gaussians ( cg ) @xcite are used as basis functions in this procedure .",
    "the cg basis has a long history in atomic and molecular physics and highly accurate calculations are based on this form of basis functions @xcite .",
    "the angular part is given by the global vector representation @xcite .",
    "this approach greatly simplifies the calculations for non - spherical systems by replacing the partial wave expansion with a much simpler representation of the angular motion .",
    "the hydrogen positride ( positronium hydride ) , hps , has already been in the focus of intensive theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "this is an ideal system to test the svm .",
    "we compare the properties of the ps@xmath0 and hps molecules .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we give a brief description of the trial function and the stochastic variational method . in sect .",
    "iii the results are presented .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in sect .",
    "iv . in appendices",
    "a - d we collect some basic ingredients which are used in the present study in order to help readers reproduce our results : formulae of the matrix elements in the cg basis , the separation of the center - of - mass motion from the cg basis , the use of sherman - morrison formula in selecting nonlinear parameters , and the symmetry requirement for the trial wave function of the ps@xmath0 molecule .",
    "a system of two electrons with mass @xmath4 and two positive unit charges of mass @xmath5 is considered .",
    "their relative mass is characterized by the ratio @xmath6 , and the positronic limit is realized by @xmath7 .",
    "( though we consider the case of @xmath7 in this paper , the extension to other @xmath8 values is straightforward , so we give a formulation assuming an arbitrary mass ratio . )",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the charges and the position vectors of the particles .",
    "particle labels 1 and 3 denote the positive charges , while labels 2 and 4 denote the negative charges .",
    "a relative coordinate system is introduced by defining @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the distance vectors between the positive and negative charges in the first and second atom , and @xmath14 as the distance vector between the center - of - masses of the two atoms : @xmath15 we use the abbreviation @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the cg of the form @xmath18 is very popular in atomic and molecular physics @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 stands for a one - row vector whose @xmath20th element is @xmath11 .",
    "the merit of this basis is that the matrix elements are analytically available and unlike other trial functions ( for example , hylleraas - type functions ) one can relatively easily extend the basis for the case of more than three particles .",
    "the well - known defects of this basis are that it does not fulfill the cusp condition and its asymptotics does not follow the exponential falloff .",
    "this latter problem , especially for bound states , can be cured by taking linear combinations of adequately chosen cgs .",
    "the cg defined above is spherical and can thus describe systems with only @xmath2 orbital angular momentum .",
    "the usual way to account for the orbital motion in the case of @xmath21 is the partial - wave expansion . because of the complexities arising from the evaluation of matrix elements this expansion gets very tedious for more than three particles . to avoid",
    "this difficulty the global vector representation @xcite is used . in this approach",
    ", one defines a vector @xmath22 as a linear combination of the relative coordinates : @xmath23 and the non - spherical part of the wave function is represented by a solid spherical harmonic @xmath24 the linear combination coefficients @xmath25 are considered to be variational parameters and their optimal values are to be determined by the svm as will be discussed later .",
    "the details and examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the matrix elements for the space part of our basis function @xmath26 is given in @xcite .",
    "in the special case of @xmath27 the matrix elements can be written in much simpler form .",
    "this is shown in appendix a. in the @xmath28 case , the cg is multiplied by a polynomial of the relative coordinates . in some cases",
    "this might be very useful , it can improve the short - distance behavior , for example , but this role can also be played by an appropriate superposition of the exponentials .",
    "we use @xmath27 in this paper .",
    "the translational invariance of the wave function is ensured by requiring that the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 fulfill some special conditions .",
    "as is detailed in appendix b , these conditions ensure that the motion of the center - of - mass is factorized in a product form .    by combining the cg with the angular and spin parts",
    ", the full basis function takes the form @xmath31 with an appropriate spin function @xmath32 , where `` @xmath33 '' is the index of the basis states and @xmath34 is an antisymmetrizer for the identical fermions . in the positronium limit @xmath35",
    "the hamiltonian becomes invariant with respect to the interchange of positive and negative charges .",
    "therefore the basis function should have a definite parity under the charge - permutation operator .",
    "see appendix d for the details of the symmetry requirement on the wave function .",
    "for the special case with @xmath36 and @xmath37 in which two spins of positive charges and two electron spins are coupled to zero , respectively , the spin part of the wave function reads as @xmath38 ( note that particles 1 and 3 are positive unit charges and particles 2 and 4 are electrons . )    instead of optimizing the parameters of @xmath29 it is more advantageous to rewrite eq . ( 6 ) as @xmath39 the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath29 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is assumed to be equal to @xmath43 .",
    "there are two reasons to choose this form .",
    "the first is that in choosing @xmath43 in this way we deal with a correlation function between the particles @xmath20 and @xmath44 , while @xmath45 has no such direct meaning and during the optimization it is more difficult to limit the numerical interval of @xmath45 to be chosen from .",
    "secondly , one can utilize this specific form to make the individual steps of the parameter selection very fast . by taking a look at the expressions of the matrix elements in appendix a",
    ", it is clear that the main computational load is the calculation of the inverse and determinant of the matrix of the nonlinear parameters .",
    "the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sher ] ) offers the possibility of the usage of the sherman - morrison formula to calculate these quantities , leading to a much faster function evaluation .",
    "the details of this step are given in appendix c.      in the positronium limit @xmath35 we deal with antiparticles and the electron - positron pair can annihilate .",
    "the lifetime of the first excited - state with @xmath1 and negative parity is determined by both processes of annihilation and electric dipole transition to the ground state . the width @xmath46 for the latter process is calculated through the reduced transition probability @xmath47 for the electric dipole operator @xmath48 @xmath49 with @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the excitation energy of the first excited state .",
    "the most dominant annihilation of the first excited - state of ps@xmath0 is accompanied by the emission of two photons with energy of about 0.5 mev each .",
    "the decay width @xmath52 for the annihilation can be estimated through the decay width @xmath53 of the para - positronium in spin - singlet state .",
    "this decay width has to be multiplied by the number @xmath54 of positron - electron pairs which are in spin - singlet state in the ps@xmath0 . in the ps@xmath0 excited state",
    "we have four positron - electron pairs , among which the probability that the pair is in spin - singlet state is 1/4 because the total spin of the first excited - state of ps@xmath0 is zero , as will be shown later .",
    "( @xmath55 . ) therefore , to have an estimate for the decay due to the annihilation we can use the formula ( 2 ) of @xcite :    @xmath56    with @xmath57 where the probability of finding an electron at the position of a positron , @xmath58 , is the expectation value of @xmath59 given in a.u . , that is @xmath58 is equal to @xmath60 with the bohr radius @xmath61 . roughly speaking",
    ", the lifetime is inversely proportional to the probability of finding an electron and a positron at the same position .      to obtain very precise energy",
    ", one has to optimize the variational parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the trial function .",
    "the dimension of basis sets is typically between 100 and 1000 , and each basis state has nine nonlinear parameters .",
    "( see appendix b. ) the optimization of a function with a few thousands nonlinear parameters can not be done efficiently by using a deterministic optimization method , since this could entail the complete reconstruction of the hamiltonian matrix and diagonalization every time when some of the nonlinear parameters are altered .",
    "moreover , the deterministic search for the optimal value of such a large number of parameters is likely to get trapped in a local minimum .",
    "a procedure based on the stochastic search for the best set of nonlinear parameters can be programmed efficiently @xcite and is capable of achieving highly accurate results for most few - body systems @xcite .",
    "the essence of the strategy can be summarized as follows : let @xmath64 be the nonlinear parameters of the @xmath20th basis function out of the set of @xmath65 such basis functions .",
    "then the procedure is 0.3 cm    \\(1 ) a succession of different sets of @xmath66 are generated randomly .",
    "\\(2 ) by solving the eigenvalue problem , the corresponding energies @xmath67 are determined .",
    "\\(3 ) the parameter set @xmath68 which produces the lowest energy is then used to replace the existing @xmath69 set .",
    "\\(4 ) the procedure cycles through the different parameter sets ( @xmath70 , successively choosing different sets to minimize the energy until convergence is reached .",
    "0.3 cm    the essential reason motivating this strategy is the need to sample different sets of nonlinear parameters as fast as possible .",
    "the main advantage is that it is not necessary to recompute the complete hamiltonian nor it is necessary to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem from scratch each time a new parameter set is generated . by changing the elements of parameter set for each basis function individually , it is necessary to recompute only one row ( column ) of the hamiltonian and overlap matrices each time the parameter set @xmath69 is changed .",
    "furthermore , the solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem is also expedited since the hamiltonian matrix is already diagonal apart from one row and one column .    a similar strategy to the above was used when adding additional terms to the basis .",
    "the speed of the calculation can be further increased if one changes the nonlinear parameters @xmath71 in a special way .",
    "this is described in appendix c.    the above way of finding the best parameters is certainly very restricted .",
    "even this simple method gives very accurate energies .",
    "more sophisticated technique may give better results in a smaller basis size .",
    "the results of calculations for the ground state of hps and ps@xmath0 and the first excited - state of ps@xmath0 are reported in this section .",
    "the ground states of hps and ps@xmath0 have already been subject to intensive calculations and some of the results obtained before for these systems serve as validation of the svm .",
    "the calculation of the properties of the excited state of the ps@xmath0 is the primary focus of this paper .",
    "we have previously reported the energy of the ground state of the ps@xmath0 and predicted the existence of an excited state of this molecule . this paper reports considerably improved energies by further optimization of the nonlinear parameters of the basis .",
    "the further optimization and the increase of the basis dimension has produced an improved wave function and we present different properties of these systems by using that wave function .",
    "we show the convergence of the binding energies and various expectation values as a function of the dimension of the basis .",
    "the results in the tables are shown for the basis dimensions of @xmath72 .",
    "the basis has been subject of intensive optimizations at these dimensions .",
    "once the optimization at a given basis size has been finished , new basis states have been added ( each of them has been selected amongst hundreds of random candidates ) to reach the next basis size where the optimization is started again . while the pattern of convergence is a very useful information about the accuracy of the results",
    ", one has to keep in mind that this can be distorted by many extraneous factors .",
    "this is because one can not guarantee that the quality of these optimizations is the same .",
    "we expect that the stochastic selection of the basis is close to be the optimal choice for lower dimensions , but for large dimensions ( @xmath73 ) the procedure becomes more time consuming and we have less chance to find the optimal parameters .",
    "the boundness of the exotic molecule , hps , has been known theoretically for many years @xcite and it has recently been created and observed in collisions between positrons and methane @xcite . the investigation of the stability of positronic atoms has been attracting much attention because positrons can be used as a tool for positron - annihilation spectroscopy in condensed matter physics .",
    "the hps molecule is the simplest but ideal hydride to test the svm .",
    "it is also very intriguing to see the difference between the properties of ps@xmath0 and hps .",
    "the energy calculated by svm and by other methods are shown in table i. the proton mass is taken to be infinite .",
    "the two electrons are assumed to be in spin - singlet state .",
    "the spin states of the proton and the positron can be taken arbitrary .",
    "our result , already at the dimension of @xmath74 , is better than the previous calculations .",
    "the increase of the basis size improves the energy further .",
    "the need of improved accuracy can be clearly seen in table ii , where various expectation values are listed .",
    "the expectation value @xmath75 , for example , is much less accurate than the energy and it is considerably improved beyond the dimension @xmath74 .    one can compare the expectation values of the separation distances of the particles in the hps to those in the h and ps atoms .",
    "the average electron - positron distance is 3.48 @xmath61 in hps , which is slightly different from that in the positronium atom ( 3 @xmath61 ) .",
    "the average electron - proton distance in hps and h is considerably different ( 2.31 @xmath61 and 1.5 @xmath61 ) .",
    "the average distance between the two positive charges ( 3.66 @xmath61 ) is much larger than that in the h@xmath0 molecule ( 1.41 @xmath61 ) .    the correlation function defined by latexmath:[\\[c({\\bf r})=\\langle \\psi | \\delta({\\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j-{\\bf r } )    various average distances .",
    "this quantity can be calculated by using eqs .",
    "( 34 ) and ( 35 ) . for the spherical wave function with @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath77 is a function of @xmath78 , that is , the monopole density , and for the @xmath1 wave function , it consists of two terms of monopole and quadrupole densities .",
    "figure 1 displays @xmath79 for various pairs of the constituents of hps .",
    "the two electrons are attracted by the proton , but the proton - electron correlation function is much broader than that in the h atom , while they are separated with its maximum density being at about 2.8 a.u .",
    "the positron moves furthest from the proton and has a peak density around at 2.6 a.u . from the electron .    the @xmath80 annihilation rate , calculated from eq .",
    "( 16 ) with @xmath81 and @xmath82 of table ii , is found to be @xmath83 , improving the previous estimates @xcite by about @xmath84 .",
    "the energies by svm are compared to the best previous results in table iii .",
    "the result of svm , again , already at the dimension of @xmath74 , is better than the energy of the previous calculations .",
    "the increase of the basis size improves the accuracy and the virial factor @xmath85 becomes as small as @xmath86 , improving the previously best calculation by more than 4 order of magnitude .",
    "the average electron - positron distance is 4.487 @xmath61 , which is about 1.5 times larger than in the positronium atom .",
    "the @xmath80 annihilation rate calculated from eq .",
    "( 16 ) by using @xmath82 of table ii is found to be @xmath87 .",
    "the electron - electron and the electron - positron correlation functions are compared in fig .",
    "the peak position of the electron - electron correlation function is shifted to larger distances compared to the one of the electron - positron correlation function .",
    "the electron - positron correlation function in ps@xmath0 has much broader distribution than the corresponding function in a ps atom .      in our previous paper",
    "we have predicted the existence of the first excited - state of the ps@xmath0 molecule .",
    "this is a unique bound - state which can not decay into two ps atoms due to the pauli principle .",
    "the spin of this state is @xmath36 and the orbital angular momentum is @xmath1 with negative parity . in this spin state , the ps@xmath0 molecule can dissociate into two ps atoms ( bosons ) only if the relative orbital angular momentum is even .",
    "consequently , the ps@xmath0 molecule with @xmath1 and negative parity can not decay into the ground states of two ps atoms ( ps(@xmath2)+ps(@xmath2 ) ) .",
    "the energy of this ps@xmath88 state ( @xmath890.334408 a.u . , see table iii ) is lower than the energy of the relevant threshold ( @xmath900.3125 a.u . ) , and this state is therefore stable against the autodissociation into ps(@xmath2)+ps(@xmath1 ) .",
    "the binding energy of this state is 0.5961 ev , which is by about 40% more than that of the ground state of ps@xmath0 ( 0.4355 ev ) .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the bound excited state is essentially a system where two ps atoms , one in its ground state and the other in its first excited @xmath91 state , are weakly coupled .",
    "the expectation value of the average electron - positron distance shown in table v supports this picture : the value of 7.57 @xmath61 in the excited state is 15 % larger than the average ( 6.5 @xmath61 ) of the electron - positron distances in the @xmath2 ground state of the ps atom ( 3 @xmath61 ) and the @xmath1 excited state of the ps atom ( 10 @xmath61 ) .",
    "we can also estimate the root - mean - square distance @xmath92 between the two atoms by    @xmath93    the symmetry properties of the ps@xmath0 wave function are used to obtain the second equality . using the values of tables iv and v yields @xmath94 a.u . for the @xmath1 excited state and",
    "@xmath95 a.u .",
    "for the @xmath2 ground state .",
    "figure 3 displays the electron - electron and electron - positron correlation functions . as mentioned before , the correlation function for the @xmath1 state consists of the monopole and quadrupole densities and their shapes depend on the magnetic quantum number @xmath5 of the wave function . of course",
    "the @xmath5-dependence of the shapes is not independent of each other but is determined by the clebsch - gordan coefficient .",
    "the quadrupole density is contributed only from the @xmath91-wave for the electron - positron relative motion , while the monopole density is contributed by both @xmath96- and @xmath91-waves .",
    "figure 3(a ) plots the correlation functions for @xmath97 and fig .",
    "3(b ) the correlation functions for @xmath98 . as the correlation function",
    "is axially symmetric around the @xmath99 axis and has a reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath100 plane , the correlation function sliced on the @xmath101 plane is drawn as a function of @xmath102 .",
    "the electron - electron correlation function has a peak at the point corresponding to the average distance of 7.57 a.u .",
    "the electron - positron correlation function has two peaks reflecting the fact that the basic structure of the second bound - state is a weakly coupled system of a ps atom in the @xmath2 state and another ps atom in the @xmath1 spatially extended state .",
    "the peak located at a larger distance from the origin is due to the @xmath91-wave component of the ps@xmath0 molecule .    by using the obtained value for @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( 16 ) , the lifetime due to the annihilation is estimated to be 0.44 ns .",
    "this is about twice of the lifetime of the ps@xmath0 ground state .",
    "the @xmath47 value is calculated to be @xmath104 . by combining this value with the dipole transition energy of 4.94 ev",
    ", the lifetime due to the electric dipole transition has been found to be 2.1 ns .",
    "the branching of the electric dipole transition is thus about 17 % of the total decay rate .",
    "therefore , both branches contribute to the decay of the excited state of the ps@xmath0 molecule .",
    "its lifetime is finally estimated to be about 0.37 ns .",
    "the excitation energy of 4.94 ev found for the ps@xmath0 is different by 0.16 ev from the corresponding excitation energy ( 5.10 ev ) of a ps atom .",
    "this difference seems to be large enough to detect its existence , e.g. in the photon absorption spectrum of the positronium gas .",
    "we have used the correlated gaussians combined with the angular functions which are specified by the global vector .",
    "nonlinear parameters of the bases have been determined by the stochastic variational method .",
    "we have considerably improved the results of the previous calculations for the ground state of hps and ps@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we have calculated various expectation values , correlation functions and other properties of the excited state of the ps@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the excited state of the ps@xmath0 molecule has the orbital angular momentum @xmath1 , the spin @xmath36 , and negative parity .",
    "the excitation energy of the state is 4.941 ev , 0.596 ev below the threshold of ps@xmath105+ps@xmath106 .",
    "though this state is in the continuum of ps@xmath105+ps@xmath105 channel , it is stable against autodissociation into that channel because of the pauli principle .",
    "the main decay mode of this state is the annihilation emitting two photons of about 0.5 mev each which , except for the tiny binding - energy difference , is equal to the photon energies of ps atoms .",
    "the annihilation decay mode is not useful to confirm experimentally the existence of the ps@xmath0 molecule .",
    "we have discussed a unique decay mode of the excited state , the electric dipole transition to the ground state .",
    "the lifetime due to the electric dipole transition has been calculated to be 2.1 ns , while the lifetime due to the annihilation is 0.44 ns .",

    "let us assume that we change the matrix @xmath29 of nonlinear parameters in such a way that we change the parameter @xmath159 of the relative motion between particles @xmath20 and @xmath44 to @xmath160 but keep all other matrix elements unchanged .",
    "this is certainly a very restricted way , but in this case the computer time required for the evaluation of the matrix elements tremendously decreases .",
    "this change of @xmath43 produces the following changes in the matrix a ( see eq .",
    "( 13 ) ) :    @xmath161    it is easy to see that this change does not violates the conditions of eq .",
    "thus the wave function with this modification is still translational invariant .",
    "the above change in the matrix @xmath29 can be simply expressed by using the vector @xmath129 defined in eq .",
    "( 30 ) as follows : @xmath162 note that @xmath163 is an @xmath126 matrix , whereas @xmath164 is just a number .",
    "as @xmath158 is equal to @xmath165 , the above change leads to the following modification of @xmath158 , @xmath166    to calculate the inverse and determinant of the above special form , the sherman - morrison formula can be used : @xmath167 and @xmath168 the advantage of this formulae is apparent : by knowing @xmath169 and det@xmath158 one can easily calculate the right - hand sides of the equations , and the @xmath170 dependence is given in a very simple form .",
    "for example , @xmath171 simply reduces to @xmath172 .",
    "likewise , @xmath173 can also be easily evaluated . to change @xmath170 , therefore there is no need for the evaluation of inverses and determinants ( which would require @xmath174 operations ) but we get the desired results by a simple multiplication and division .",
    "where the operator @xmath176 changes the indices of identical particles according to the permutation @xmath177 of the numbers @xmath178 , and @xmath179 is the phase of the permutation .",
    "the effect of this operator on the set of the position vectors @xmath180 is                        in the spin space the permutation operator interchanges the indices of the single - particle spin functions and can be easily evaluated . as a result , the matrix element of any spin - independent operator @xmath190 which is symmetrical with respect to the permutation of identical particle coordinates can be written in the following form : @xmath191 where the coefficients @xmath192 have the form @xmath193 since the antisymmetrizer is a projector onto an antisymmetric state , only ket ( or bra ) function needs to be antisymmetrized .",
    "the particular value of the coefficient @xmath192 depends only on the spin function of the system . in the case of ps@xmath0 two positrons",
    "must be antisymmetrized and likewise two electrons must be in antisymmetric states .",
    "therefore , the antisymmetrizer for this system is given by @xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the transposition of particle labels @xmath20 and @xmath44 .",
    "thus @xmath34 has four permutations @xmath196 and we can identify          the spin function @xmath200 of eq .",
    "( [ spinzero ] ) is antisymmetric in both of the positron spin coordinates and the electron spin coordinates .",
    "thus the spin matrix element @xmath201 turns out to be equal to @xmath179 and we have @xmath202 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath203 for ps@xmath0 has charge - exchange symmetry , that is , it is invariant under the exchange of the positive and negative charges : letting @xmath91 denote the charge - permutation operator , we have      therefore , the non - degenerate eigenstate of the hamiltonian is also the eigenstate of the charge - permutation operator . in the ps@xmath0",
    "the ground state is even @xmath205 under @xmath91 , while the @xmath1 excited state turns out to be odd @xmath206 .",
    "consider the case of ps @xmath207 .",
    "this system is represented by the coordinate @xmath208 .",
    "the charge permutation is thus equivalent to the parity operation .",
    "since the parity is @xmath209 for the state with orbital angular momentum @xmath210 , the eigenvalue of charge - permutation operator is also @xmath209 .",
    "the signs of @xmath12 and @xmath211 change with respect to the charge permutation @xmath212 , while @xmath14 does not .",
    "assume that the ps@xmath0 has partial waves @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 corresponding to the motion described with @xmath12 , @xmath211 and @xmath216 , respectively . when charges are permutated , the wave function @xmath217 become @xmath218 .",
    "then @xmath219 for the @xmath96 state with @xmath220 , while @xmath221 for the @xmath91 state with @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "the non - vanishing matrix element of the electric dipole transition supports that the first excited @xmath91-state is odd under the charge permutation .",
    "this is because the electric dipole operator @xmath224 has the following form except for the constant :      which changes sign under the charge permutation .",
    "therefore , if the excited @xmath91-state is even under the charge permutation , then the electric dipole matrix element between the @xmath91 state and the ground state would identically vanish .",
    "the charge - permutation operator @xmath91 is given by @xmath212 or @xmath226 .",
    "when the wave function @xmath217 is already antisymmetrized for two positrons and for two electrons , then we can see that both operators give the same effect . to understand this we use the following identity          the evaluation of matrix elements between the states with odd charge symmetry",
    "can be done in a similar manner to the previous subsection by extending eqs .",
