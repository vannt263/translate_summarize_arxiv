    "in the response theory based on an electron gas model , an essential role has been played by the retarded @xmath0inear density response function ( @xmath0drf ) ever since its specific form of the 3-dimensional electron gas ( 3deg ) was known by lindhard while the 2d @xmath0drf by stern@xcite .",
    "however , the higher order drfs become important when a nonlinear effect comes into a play .",
    "a prominent example is the so - called barkas effect in the electronic energy loss problem@xcite , which could not be explained by the linear density response theory@xcite .    on the way to tackle the barkas effect",
    ", physicists tried to obtain the analytic form of the quadratic order drf .",
    "the low - frequency limit of the real part of 3d qdrf was obtained by lloyd and sholl @xcite whereas the same limit of the imaginary part was done by hu and zaremba@xcite .",
    "however , the complete form of the wavevector- and frequency - dependent 3d qdrf did not appear until cenni and sarraco(cs ) reported its real part@xcite while pitarke , ritchie , echenique and zaremba reported its imaginary part@xcite .",
    "soon after the work of pitarke _ _ et al.__@xcite , richardson and ashcroft(ra ) reported another form of the imaginary part obtained by a technique based on the feynman trick in the imaginary frequency space@xcite .    a specific form of both",
    "the time - ordered and the retarded qdrf in 3d was reported by pitarke , ritchie and echenique(pre)@xcite , and later by del rio and pitarke@xcite .",
    "they followed the field - theoretic approach , and adopted the real part of 3d qdrf obtained by cs@xcite .",
    "they also found an interesting collinear - limit expression that looks like the _ decomposition theorem _ claimed by cs .",
    "as for the imaginary part , they took a different approach from ra .",
    "they separated the contribution of the infinitesimal imaginary frequencies from the principal part .",
    "the same method was applied to the 2d qdrf by bergara , pitarke and echenique(bpe)@xcite . before bpe came out",
    ", zhang also reported a closed - form expression of the static 2d qdrf and even the expression of the static 2d drf generalized up to the infinite order@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , rommel and kalman obtained other closed - form expressions of the wavevector- and frequency - dependent retarded qdrfs in various dimensions without relying on the so - called feynman trick .",
    "they calculated the real and imaginary parts all at once not separately .",
    "they could write the 2d and 3d qdrfs in terms of a complex function that looks much simpler than any other reported expression . especially in a 2deg they noticed a number of conspicuous remarkable static features that will be referred to as _ vanishing , discontinuity _ and _ _ peaks__@xcite",
    ". however , there had been some mistakes in their calculations that became clarified and corrected later@xcite .",
    "the main difficulties in obtaining the closed - form of the qdrf are two fold .",
    "one comes from the intricacy involved in the derivation of the qdrf in relation to the three - point density correlation functions@xcite , or more generally the nonlinear fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite .",
    "the other comes from the different mathematical techniques involved in the integration of the one - loop triangle diagrams of the qdrf@xcite .",
    "the closed - form expression of the qdrf varies depending on the integration technique that has been adopted , making the comparison hard to be achieved .    however , there are a number of things that can be said about the complex closed form(eq.([chi in mu ] ) and eq.([f function single ] ) ) of the 2d qdrf presented in this paper .",
    "firstly , the retarded expression(eq.([f ] ) and table [ ff ] ) in this paper is valid for a 2deg only at zero temperature .",
    "secondly , the retarded expression(eq.([f ] ) and table [ ff ] ) in this paper is identical to the eq.(2.16 ) in bpe with no difference except the overall sign .",
    "in fact , bpe mentioned that eq.(2.16 ) is retarded@xcite .",
    "thirdly , the complex closed form of the 2d qdrf is different from the 2d qdrf in bpe even if they are composed of the similar expressions in part . the complex closed form in this paper is written in terms of a non - analytic complex function , and its real and imaginary parts are not separated but given in terms of a single complex function .",
    "in fact , there is a difficulty in extracting the real part from the complex closed form due to the _ phase ambiguity _ that will be clearer in this paper . on the other hand , the specific forms of the real and imaginary parts in bpe are written in the separate forms .",
    "fourthly , the complex closed form satisfies the well - known symmetry of the retarded qdrf such as the wavevector inversion symmetry and the reality condition in a real space@xcite .",
    "in addition , it behaves in a way as one expect in the static long - wavelength limit as well as in the collinear limit .",
    "finally , one may find that the complex closed - form expression suffers from the ambiguity(or defect ) in treating the phase of a complex function@xcite .",
    "however , the ambiguity is not due to the weakness of the complex closed form itself but it arises from the ignorance of the weakness of the current computational algorithm : especially in treating the phase of the non - analytic complex function .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec.[2dqdrf ] , a closed - form expression of the wavevector- and frequency - dependent retarded qdrf of a 2deg will be written in terms of a complex function that will be analytically calculated with a mathematical rigor . in sec.[ch",
    "static ] , a careful analysis will be made of the mathematical mechanism of vanishing , discontinuity and peaks with emphasis on the exact static 2d qdrf . in subsec.[ambiguity ] , special attention will be paid to an ambiguity in treating the phase of the non - analytic complex function .",
    "the conclusion will be given in sec.[conc ] .",
    "let us focus on a homogeneous non - interacting electron gas at zero temperature driven by a classically behaving external potential @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath2 consists of the kinetic part @xmath3 and the interaction part @xmath4 : @xmath5 . with the form of @xmath6 as the interaction part",

    "it is noteworthy that the quadratic order density response is retarded due to the condition of the heaviside step function @xmath11 that is defined as @xmath12 for @xmath13 and zero for @xmath14 .    by performing the fourier transform of eq.([rho2 ] )",
    ", one will end up with @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the retarded qdrf of a non - interacting electron gas . even if @xmath17 is the usual notation for the drf of a non - interacting electron gas , @xmath18",
    "will be used for it throughout this paper : refer to the appendix [ app qdrf ] for more details about @xmath18 .",
    "the retarded qdrf of @xmath16 can be given as a summation of six @xmath19 functions , which are defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spin index and @xmath22 is the volume factor .",
    "@xmath23 is a complex value with the real @xmath24@xmath25 and the positive infinitesimal @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 .",

    "moreover @xmath34 is not defined at @xmath37 or @xmath38 , and it is limited to the range of @xmath39 . here it is worthwhile to emphasize that the imaginary part of the frequency @xmath40 in the table [ ff ] can be either positive or negative depending on the sign in front of it .",
    "moreover , six @xmath31 s in table [ ff ] coincide with the corresponding expression eq.(2.16 ) in bpe@xcite within the wavevector inversion symmetry : in fact , no difference except the overall sign .    .[ff]all",

    "here it is explained how the phase ambiguity comes about .",
    "let us focus on the @xmath59 square in cartesian coordinates @xmath60 and consider the values of @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] .",

    "one should take it more serious to violate the triangle rule than to find no discontinuity .",

    "from the fact of @xmath65 } ) = \\ln(e^{i 2\\pi } ) = \\ln 1 = 0 $ ] , each phase - sum of @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] is equivalent to @xmath37 or congruent to 0 . in other words",
    "they vanish independently .",
    "therefore , in the second way to sum up the phases , the term of @xmath62 $ ] always vanishes with no effect at all , so that @xmath66 can be determined solely by @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "unfortunately this ambiguity brings on the overall sign ambiguity accompanied by the value of @xmath63 $ ] itself changed . to make it clearer ,",
    "let us focus on the term @xmath67 in @xmath68 $ ] ignoring @xmath62 $ ] because it vanishes in the second case .",
    "we find that any @xmath67 is not less than 0 , so that @xmath63 $ ] is also positive making @xmath66 be negative .",
    "however , this contradicts the plot of @xmath66 obtained from the first case , where the sign of @xmath66 is opposite .    where does the sign ambiguity come from ? to answer the question , we should go back to the first case .",
    "let us look at the effect of @xmath69 on @xmath70 .",
    "we find any @xmath71 is not greater than 0 because of @xmath72 in @xmath68 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase of any @xmath67 is in the range of @xmath73 .",
    "then , we find @xmath74 . now let us recall the next step taken in the first case .",
    "we should sum up the three @xmath70 s to get @xmath63 $ ] , which makes three @xmath34 s cancel each other out due to the fact of @xmath75 .",
    "if this cancellation was taken into account in advance , the phase of @xmath70 would be in the range of @xmath76 .",
    "compare it with the phase of @xmath73 that are only terms counted on in the second case .",
    "we find the sign of the former is opposite the latter . which is the correct sign ?",
    "we do not find any reason to violate the _ triangle rule _ by separating two logarithmic terms of @xmath31 , so that the plots of @xmath66 in fig.([fig:3d ] ) look feasible even if there is an overall sign ambiguity .",
    "moreover , the second way to sum up the phase is equivalent to removing the second logarithmic term of @xmath31 in eq.([f function 1 ] ) or eq.([f function ] ) .",
    "however , this removal can lead @xmath31 to diverge for @xmath77 in the static short - wavelength limit or in the high - frequency limit . to avoid the ambiguity and the divergence in a numerical calculation , we should write @xmath31 in a single logarithmic term as given in eq.([f function single ] ) .    j. lindhard and k. dan , vidensk . selsk .",
