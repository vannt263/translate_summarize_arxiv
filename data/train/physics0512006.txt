    "the main goal of this paper is to study bifurcations for one - dimensional internal solitary waves propagating along the interface between two ideal fluids with different densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the lighter fluid with density @xmath5 lies above the heavier fluid with density @xmath4 : @xmath6 .",
    "these bifurcations occur if the solitary wave velocity @xmath7 coincides with the minimum phase velocity @xmath8 of linear internal waves .",
    "if the upper density @xmath5 is small enough compared to the lower density @xmath4 , then a bifurcation similar to that for pure gravity - capillary waves occurs @xcite . in this case",
    "solitary waves undergo a supercritical bifurcation at the critical velocity : their form approaches the form of the envelope solitons for the focusing one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation ( 1d nlse ) @xcite .",
    "the soliton amplitude behaves universally near the critical velocity @xmath9 : it vanishes like @xmath10 .",
    "the width of the solitary wave increases proportionally to @xmath11 .    as the density ratio @xmath12 increases , the character of the nonlinear interactions changes .",
    "the four - wave coupling coefficient decreases and vanishes at @xmath13 @xcite , that is when @xmath14 .",
    "such a value may not be obtained easily in a two - fluid configuration .",
    "however , it may be relevant in a three - layer ( or more ) configuration @xcite , or in nonlinear optics , where similar singularities can occur . above the critical ratio ,",
    "solitary waves undergo a subcritical bifurcation : at the critical velocity , their amplitude jumps from zero for @xmath12 below @xmath15 , up to finite values when @xmath12 is above the critical density ratio . in order to describe such type of bifurcation",
    ", it is necessary to keep the next order terms beyond the classical 1d nlse .",
    "when the density ratio varies in a neighborhood of the critical density ratio , it is possible to use , as in the derivation of the classical nlse , perturbation theory assuming that the interacting wave amplitudes are small . at leading order , one needs to keep three kinds of terms .",
    "the first one , coming from the four - wave interaction , takes into account the so - called lifshitz invariant @xcite .",
    "this term is local relative to the amplitude of the soliton and its first spatial derivative and , as was shown in @xcite , appears from the expansion of four - wave interaction element under the assumption about its analytical dependence .",
    "however , for deep - water internal waves , as we show in this paper , there exists also a nonlocal term which has the same order of magnitude as the first one @xcite .",
    "its structure is similar to the dysthe term first found for water ( gravity ) waves @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the case of water waves ,",
    "this term is responsible for the interaction of a narrow wave packet ( in @xmath16-space ) with mean flow , induced by the packet .",
    "the third term takes into account six - wave interactions . in order to find the six - wave coupling coefficient",
    ", one needs to calculate all possible renormalizations due to three- , four- and five - wave interactions and therefore this partial problem requires a lot of cumbersome calculations . for these calculations we use the hamiltonian formalism ( see the review @xcite , as well as the papers @xcite ) , which appears to be the most adequate method for this subject . in @xcite , a different method was used : the problem was reformulated as a spatial dynamical system and only the reversibility was exploited .",
    "it is necessary to underline also that the use of the hamiltonian approach to study solitary waves gives an appropriate framework for the temporal behavior of the dynamics of solitary waves , e.g. their stability . through this formalism , it is easy to perform different kinds of averaging and perturbations .",
    "second , it is crucial that by applying the hamiltonian technique the averaging equations of motion retain their original hamiltonian form . in particular",
    ", this is of great help for the investigation of soliton stability ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",

    "the kinematic conditions hold : @xmath31 the dynamic condition reduces to the discontinuity of pressures across the interface due to capillarity : @xmath32 the use of bernoulli equations in each fluid allows to rewrite the latter equation in terms of potentials and their derivatives : @xmath33 the equations ( [ laplace])([bern ] ) conserve the total energy : @xmath34 where the kinetic energy is equal to @xmath35 and the potential energy is given by the expression @xmath36 as shown first in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the equations of motion ( [ kin ] ) and ( [ bern ] ) together with the laplace equations ( [ laplace ] ) represent a hamiltonian system .",

    "the given hamiltonian form generalizes zakharov s canonical form for free - surface hydrodynamics @xcite . a hamiltonian formulation of the problem of a free interface between two ideal fluids , under rigid lid boundary conditions for the upper fluid , was also given by benjamin & bridges @xcite .",
    "craig & groves @xcite give a similar expression , by using the dirichlet - neumann operators for both the upper and lower fluid domains ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can be expanded in series with respect to powers of the canonical variables . in this case",
    "the steepness of the interface plays the role of a small parameter of expansion .",
    "due to the conservation of the total mass for each fluid this expansion begins with the quadratic term .",
    "it is more convenient to work in fourier space .",

    "when the equation @xmath64 has real roots ( say @xmath65 ) , then , in accordance with @xmath66 , the solution of ( [ sol ] ) will be of the form : @xmath67 hence taking the first term as the zero approximation , after iteration the solution of this equation can be represented as an infinite series with respect to @xmath68 : @xmath69 in @xmath45space , this solution is equivalent to a periodic solution ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "physically , this criterion is very transparent .",
    "the equality ( [ cher ] ) is the resonance condition for cherenkov radiation of waves by an object moving with the velocity @xmath7 . due to such radiation",
    "a solitary wave will lose its energy and therefore can not be steady .    for the internal wave dispersion ( [ dispersion ] ) the maximum solitary wave velocity @xmath7 coincides with the minimum phase velocity of linear waves : @xmath70 it occurs when @xmath71 ^{1/2}.   \\label{crit = k}\\ ] ] at this point the values of the linear frequency and critical velocity are @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the atwood number .    as the maximum solitary wave velocity is approached , the amplitude @xmath57 given by ( [ sol ] ) reaches a very sharp maximum at the point @xmath65 , where the straight line @xmath74 touches the dispersion curve @xmath75 : @xmath76 ^{-1}f_k .",

    "hence one can see that as @xmath81 the width of the distribution @xmath82 tends to zero , which corresponds to the peak at @xmath65 becoming narrower and narrower . due to the nonlinearities of the wave system this peak generates multiple harmonics near @xmath83 with integer @xmath84 .",
    "if the amplitude of this peak is small ( if , for instance , it vanishes smoothly while approaching the critical velocity ) then we can use the perturbation theory that consists in expanding @xmath85 through its harmonics : @xmath86 here the small parameter @xmath87 and the `` slow '' coordinate @xmath88 are introduced , so that @xmath89 is the amplitude of the envelope of _ n_-th harmonic .",
    "the assumption that the solitary wave amplitude vanishes continuously at @xmath90 means that the leading term of the series in eq .",
    "( [ expand ] ) corresponds to the first harmonic , and all other harmonics are small with respect to the parameter @xmath91 .",
    "this is the condition under which the nonlinear schrdinger equation is derived ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this case , at leading order in @xmath91 , we obtain the stationary nlse ( compare with @xcite ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 is related to the matrix element @xmath94 of four - wave interactions ( see below ) as @xmath95    > from now on , we drop the subscript @xmath96 for @xmath97 . in complete correspondence with ( [ var ] ) , the envelope equation ( [ snls ] )",
    "can be recasted in the following variational problem : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the number of waves or the wave action .",
    "the ( averaged ) hamiltonian @xmath100 is given by the expression @xmath101 in this approximation the leading term in the interaction hamiltonian @xmath49 has the form @xmath102 the tilde denotes renormalization of the vertex @xmath103 due to the interaction with the zeroth and second harmonics , corresponding to the cubic terms in the hamiltonian @xmath61 .",
    "thus , after averaging , the soliton solution is a stationary point of the ( averaged ) hamiltonian for fixed @xmath104 .",

    "( [ snls ] ) one can see that the localized solution is possible if the coupling coefficient @xmath93 is negative ( focusing nonlinearity ) .",

    "( [ snls ] ) can be rewritten in dimensionless variables as follows : @xmath106 its soliton solution @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 hence it follows that while approaching the critical velocity the soliton amplitude vanishes like @xmath109 and the soliton width grows as @xmath110 .",
    "the latter means that our approximation improves when approaching the critical velocity : the wave becomes more monochromatic and nonlinearity weaker .",
    "this approximation becomes exact at the critical velocity .",
    "as we show in the next section such a situation occurs for all interfacial solitary waves when the density ratio is less than the critical value @xmath111 ( see for example @xcite ) . while increasing @xmath0 the four - wave coupling coefficient @xmath112 remains negative up to the critical ratio , where it vanishes . for @xmath2",
    "the coefficient @xmath112 becomes positive , so that the nonlinear interaction in ( [ snls ] ) changes its character , from focusing to defocusing .",
    "in this case , in order to have solitary wave solutions , one needs to keep next order terms beyond the classical nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ snls ] ) , which should provide existence of localized solutions in the form of solitary waves .",
    "such solutions were computed numerically using the full water - wave equations by laget & dias @xcite .",
    "bridges et al .",
    "@xcite computed finite - amplitude travelling waves near the transition from focusing to defocusing .",
    "the simplest weakly nonlinear extension retains the terms due to six - wave interactions .",
    "such interactions should be of the focusing type in order to compensate for the defocusing four - wave interaction . from this consideration",
    "it becomes clear that the soliton amplitude undergoes a jump at the point @xmath90 .",
    "it is easy to estimate that such a jump will be proportional to @xmath113 . in order to obtain convergence of the hamiltonian series expansion",
    ", the jump must be small .",
    "in other words , such an expansion will be valid if the deviation of @xmath0 from its critical value @xmath1 is small enough .",
    "the appearance of the jump at the critical velocity means that the soliton undergoes subcritical bifurcation .",
    "such type of bifurcation is analogous to phase transition of first order .",
    "if the corresponding jump is small then we have the analogue of the first - order phase transition close to the second - order phase transition . for phase transitions such",
    "a situation occurs in a small neighborhood of the so - called tri - critical point .",
    "now we will give the general structure of the hamiltonian expansion corresponding to interfacial waves near the critical density ratio assuming the following two dimensionless parameters are small : @xmath114 as mentioned before , there are in this case three main contributions to nonlinear terms ( which , for instance , can balance dispersion , thus providing the existence of stationary solitary waves ) .",
    "two contributions come from the expansion of the four - wave interaction hamiltonian .",
    "because a stationary localized solution is assumed to be an envelope soliton , i.e. its spectrum remains narrow and concentrated near @xmath65 , we have to expand the four - wave matrix element @xmath115 , keeping the first - order terms that are linear in @xmath116 .",
    "as shown in the next section , this expansion contains local and nonlocal terms : @xmath117 the constants @xmath118 and @xmath119 have different parity relative to reflection @xmath120 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath121 changes its sign , but the coefficient @xmath122 retains its sign under this transform .",

    "one can easily see that the contributions from terms proportional to @xmath136 in @xmath133 and the six - wave hamiltonian can be determined independently , which makes calculations more simple .",
    "we begin our calculations with the four - wave matrix element @xmath137 in order to find @xmath138 and its `` derivatives '' @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    the usual way to calculate matrix elements",
    "consists in expanding the hamiltonian in series with respect to powers of the canonical variables @xmath139 and @xmath38 .",

    "as pointed out in section iii , the calculation of the nonlinear coupling coefficients @xmath121 , @xmath122 and of the six - wave coefficient @xmath130 can be performed independently for each coefficient .",
    "therefore for the coefficient @xmath130 this problem reduces to the calculation of the nonlinear frequency shift for the main harmonic with @xmath65 and @xmath439 when the first contribution to the nonlinear frequency shift proportional to @xmath440 is equal to zero .",
    "second , in such a case , it is enough to consider its limit of a monochromatic wave , instead of a quasi - monochromatic wave .",
    "this means that one needs to develop the perturbation theory assuming that @xmath441 where the leading order corresponds to the main harmonic @xmath442 and amplitudes of all other ( combined ) harmonics are supposed to be small in comparison with the first harmonic amplitude .    after this remark",
    "we introduce the small parameter @xmath443 so that @xmath444 where @xmath445 is a slow time and @xmath446 is the envelope of the main harmonic .",
    "hence it is easy to see that all needed combined harmonics @xmath447 become functions of the slow time @xmath103 and take in their expansion powers of the parameter @xmath443 : @xmath448 note that in this case nonlinear interactions with the zeroth harmonic do not give any contribution because the corresponding matrix elements vanish by the same law as for three - wave interaction .",
    "the equations of motion for amplitudes @xmath447 follow from the general equation ( [ k - rep ] ) for normal amplitude @xmath41 : @xmath449 c_n =- i\\frac{\\partial \\overline{h}_{\\mathrm{int}}}{\\partial c_n^{*}}.   \\label{app-4}\\ ] ] here @xmath450 is mean value of the interaction hamiltonian after substitution expressions ( [ app-1 ] ) into ( [ h - int ] ) and average .",
    "@xmath450 contains 19 matrix coefficients needed to determine the constant @xmath130 : @xmath451 where @xmath452 , @xmath453 , and so on .",
    "these 19 coefficients are calculated in accordance with the rules explained in the third section .    as is seen from the equation of motion ( [ app-4 ] )",
    "the time derivative of @xmath447 is small compared with the second term @xmath454 c_n$ ] , except the main harmonic where this term vanishes . in its turn , the equation for @xmath455 contains terms proportional to @xmath456 and @xmath457 .",
    "the terms of the third order ( @xmath458 @xmath456 ) are nothing more than the relation ( [ crit - ratio ] ) serving for definition of the critical atwood number : @xmath459 the equation of motion for @xmath85 appears in the fifth order of @xmath443 : @xmath460 where all matrix elements are defined without factors of @xmath461 as they had according to the definition of section iii ( compare with ( [ u ] ) , ( [ v ] ) , [ t-4 ] ) ) .    here",
    "the amplitudes @xmath462 are found with the help of equations ( [ app-4 ] ) .",
    "this is a pure algebraic procedure which we performed with the help of computer . as the result of substitution of @xmath463 into the above equation",
    "we arrive at the equation : @xmath464 the corresponding nonlinear term is focusing ."
