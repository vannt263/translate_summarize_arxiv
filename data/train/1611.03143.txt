    "understanding the motion of bloch electrons in crystal structures is one of the traditional subjects of solid state physics , for which a number of techniques have been developed .",
    "the wave - particle duality of electrons in a crystal plays an essential role .",
    "particularly , in the presence of an electric field , electrons are accelerated and its wavelength is shortened in such a manner that when it is twice the lattice spacing , it undergoes bragg diffraction in reciprocal and real spaces , hence describing a periodic motion whose period depends entirely on the periodicity of the crystal along the field direction and the strength of the applied field itself  @xcite .",
    "this periodic motion has been dubbed bloch oscillations ( bo ) and its description is known for almost one century from the seminal work of bloch  @xcite . in real solids , intraband tunneling and ultrafast electron scattering prevent bo from being observed .",
    "nevertheless , in high - purity semiconductor superlattices this phenomenon has been directly observed under a variety of experimental conditions  @xcite .",
    "the smoking gun is a plot of a certain displacement of electron position with sinusoidal profile in time .",
    "moreover , within thefield of quantum simulators , where the main idea is that quantum dynamics of a givensystem can be reproduced by an equivalent optical system which can be quantum or classical .",
    "bo can be observed in a variety of different equivalent systems to bulk crystals , like atomic systems @xcite , dielectric @xcite and plasmonic @xcitewaveguidesarrays and so on .",
    "therefore , in this article we exploit the mathematical structure of the equations governing bo which can extended to other systems    in this article , we discuss the _ inverse _ bo problem ( ibo ) : given an _",
    "`` experimental '' _ , periodic curve representing the real space motion of electrons in a solid subject to an external electric field as a function of time and assuming that bo drive the dynamics , we determine the strength of the applied field or , equivalently , the lattice spacing at fixed electric field intensity .",
    "we use the linear chain as our working example and consider the nearest ( 1n ) and next - to - nearest ( 2n ) neighbors tight binding approximation .",
    "although a plethora of methods to analyze periodic curves are known and well established , in this article we construct an efficient machine learning algorithm based on artificial neural networks ( ann )  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the anns consists in simulate the complex structure of the biological neurons with a simplified interconnection of computational nodes whose main objective is to process a set of signals and learn to classify them .",
    "when this is done in a proper way , the ann can produce accurate predictions for signals that have never been presented to the network .",
    "this method of classification can be very efficient and accurate .    to address the issue of ibo , the remaining of the article",
    "is organized as follows : section 2 presents the semiclassical framework to describe bo in a monoatomic lineal chain .",
    "section 3 is devoted to introduce the setup of our ann .",
    "section 4 presents the data processing analysis and final remarks are given in section 5 .",
    "we start our discussion from the tight - binding hamiltonian of a monoatomic lineal chain of lattice spacing @xmath1 . at the 1n approximation , we have @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hopping parameter . from bloch theorem , it is straightforward to find that in this case , the energy - momentum dispersion relation is @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 is the on - site energy and @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , for the 2n neighbors approximation , @xmath8 in this case , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the hopping for the corresponding neighbor . then , from bloch theorem we have that the dispersion relation is @xmath11 but in this case @xmath12 and @xmath13 while @xmath14    next , we recall the semiclassical equations of motion for an electron moving in an external electric field @xmath15 oriented parallel to the linear chain , @xmath16 where in place of @xmath17 we can insert @xmath18 or @xmath19 from eqs .",
    "( [ en ] ) or ( [ enn ] ) , respectively .",
    "we can straightforwardly integrate the equations of motion and obtain the velocities and trajectories for a given external field strength . considering the chain oriented along the @xmath20 axis and a uniform electric field",
    "@xmath21 , we integrate eq .",
    "( [ em1 ] ) assuming the initial condition @xmath22 .",
    "thus @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the crystal - momentum of electrons in the linear chain . on the other hand ,",
    "the electron velocity is given in eq .",
    "( [ em2 ] ) , which for 1n is @xmath25 finally , we obtain the profile of bo simply integrating eq .",
    "( [ veln ] ) , which yields @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "analogously , for the 2n , we straightforwardly obtain @xmath28 equations  ( [ 1v ] ) and  ( [ 2v ] ) give a fairly good agreement to the experimental observations of bo @xcite . in the next section",
    "we introduce artificial neural networks as the tool to analyze these oscillations .",
    "among the different machine learning algorithms available nowadays , the artificial neural networks algorithm is a very useful and common option to solve classification problems . in this section",
    "we describe the implementation we use to classify bo .",
    "then we set the problem of ibo to test the performance of the approach . for simplicity ,",
    "let us describe the method when we consider only the interaction of the 1n .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is fixed and the magnitude of the electric field @xmath29 changes from 0.01 to 1 in steps of @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in units where @xmath34 .",
    "we choose a discrete set of points in time @xmath35 and a given value of the magnitude of the electric field @xmath36 .",
    "evaluating eq .",
    "( [ 1v ] ) with @xmath1 and @xmath35 given for every @xmath36 produces a set of discrete values for the position @xmath37 .",
    "the upper index @xmath38 reflects the dependence of the position of the electron on the electric field .",
    "the pairs @xmath39 are called the training and validation sets . from the total number of generated trajectories , 70% of them are in the training set and the other 30% are in the validation set .",
    "now , we use an ann to classify the bo in terms of the electric field intensity . as a first approach ,",
    "we introduce the values @xmath37 as inputs of the ann and propagate them forward obtaining as a result a value that we interpret as the corresponding electric field @xmath40 .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the network , instead of using all the values @xmath37 as inputs , it is possible to compute a discrete fast fourier transform ( dfft ) of the trajectory and only use the maximum value of the amplitude and the corresponding frequency .",
    "this approach reduces the number of inputs to only two .",
    "the structure of the ann consists in three layers ( input , hidden and output ) of neurons .",
    "all the neurons of one layer are connected to neurons of the next layer with weights .",
    "each of these weights is mathematical represented with a number , initialized randomly between -1 and 1 .",
    "every neuron has an activation function that it is used to decide how the information is propagated into the next layer .",
    "the activation functions used in this paper are logistic and linear .    after propagating forward ( from the inputs to the outputs )",
    "the amplitude and frequency of the trajectory , the obtained result @xmath40 in general does not correspond to the expected electric field @xmath36 because the ann is initialized with random coefficients . to achieve accuracy , we need to perform an optimization process where the coefficients of the network are updated in order to classify in a proper way all the elements of the training set .",
    "first , we define a cost function as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of output neurons and depends on the number of parameters predicted by the ann .",
    "we perform a minimization process using offline backpropagation algorithm with a learning parameter @xmath43 @xcite . given the trajectory of the bo for one value of @xmath29 , the internal parameters of the ann are adjusted such that the predicted value @xmath40 gets as close as possible to @xmath36 . afterward , we perform the same process over the remaining elements of the training set to achieve a good accuracy predicting all the possible values of the parameter @xmath29 in the sample .",
    "next , we use a different set of trajectories , which we call validation set , to track the behavior of the training process .",
    "if the validation error starts growing or the training error reaches a given threshold , then we stop the training process and move on to the prediction phase .",
    "after the training process is complete , we use new signals to test the accuracy of the predictions of the ann .",
    "this set has the same amount of signals than the validation set and is created using random values for @xmath29 in the given interval and it is called the prediction set . in this stage",
    "the ibo problem is posed .",
    "we are ready now to use these structures to the ibo analysis . in the next section we present technical details .",
    "the signals were discretized considering the sampling theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem establishes that the sample rate has to be at least twice the maximum frequency of the signal . in our case ,",
    "@xmath44 and so we use @xmath45        one hundred signals of bo were generated using eq .",
    "( [ 1v ] ) , varying only @xmath29 ( @xmath46 ) with steps of @xmath47 .",
    "all the remaining parameters were fixed ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the total number of @xmath35 is equal to @xmath49 to ensure that the signal created with the lowest frequency , at least has one period ( figure [ osctofrec ] ) .",

    "( [ dfft ] ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath24 and the frequency is given by @xmath59 .",
    "we use a super - index @xmath38 to denote the energy associated with the signal .",
    "the amplitude and frequency are rescaled before using them as inputs of the ann using the following transformation @xmath60 where the maximum and minimum values of @xmath61 are computed over all the elements on the training set .",
    "substituting @xmath62 and @xmath63 instead of @xmath61 gives us the two required inputs for the network .",
    "the ann classifies the input data between ten possible ranges for the electric field .",
    "we call each of these ranges a class and they are parametrized by the index @xmath64 .",
    "this means that the output generated by the network will be associated with a class , i.e. , with a corresponding electric field strength .",
    "the output neuron uses a linear activation function , so that values outside the interval @xmath65 $ ] are associated with the first or last class .",
    "the value of the targets associated with each class is given by the relation @xmath66 where the numbers @xmath67 and @xmath68 come from the fact that we divide the output interval in 10 classes .",
    "the total number of steps used to train the network is @xmath69 and the learning parameter is chosen as @xmath70 .",
    "the training process is repeated five times to verify a good performance and avoid strange initializations of weights .",
    "the weights obtained from the training are used to test the performance for every set .    to decide",
    "if the prediction is correct , we consider the following rule . if the electric field corresponding to the configuration lies in the range @xmath71 then the output is taken as a correct classification , which means that the value @xmath29 that generates the signal is in the range of values that corresponds to that class . otherwise is consider a wrong classification .",
    "once the network is completely trained over the training set , we use a set of generated trajectories with random values of @xmath29 between [ @xmath72 to verify the prediction capabilities of the ann .",
    "the average over five different prediction sets and the efficiency of the ann for all the sets is shown in table [ 1ne ] .",
    ".correctly classified patterns ( ccp ) of the ann for the signals generated varying @xmath29 between [ @xmath72 .",
    "we present the results for 70 training patterns , 30 validation patterns and the average of 5 sets of prediction of 30 patterns each .",

    "in this article , we have carried out an analysis of bo in the linear , monoatomic chain at the nearest and next - to - nearest neighbors level within a tight - binding approach .",
    "we have developed an efficient machine learning procedure using ann to explore the ibo problem .",
    "we develop a training process of the ann such that , according to our error functions , the accuracy of predictions is optimized for the ann internal parameters in a validation stage .",
    "then the predictability of the ann is tested directly from _",
    "`` experimental '' _ curves derived from directly integrating the equations of motion  ( [ 1v ] ) and  ( [ 2v ] ) for given parameters of the electric field strength @xmath29 and interatomic distance @xmath1 . retaining @xmath1 fixed , we have been able to predict the electric field strength of a random trajectory sample with 91% of accuracy for the 1n level .",
    "similar accuracy of predictions was obtained for fixed @xmath29 but varying interatomic distance @xmath1 .",
    "when both the parameters were allowed to change , at the 2n level , our predictions are accurate up to 84% for the interatomic distance and 93% for the electric field strength .",
    "because of the performance of the ann , these findings are encouraging to extend a similar strategy to explore ibo in realistic systems .",
