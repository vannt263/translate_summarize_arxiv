    "slowing down the speed of light enhance phenomena like nonlinearities  @xcite , gain / absorption  @xcite,@xcite , and phase sensitivity  @xcite",
    ". it can be also useful for practical applications like delay lines , optical memories , and low threshold lasers  @xcite .",
    "crow structures offer particular ways of slow light guiding , with photons hopping sequentially from one resonator to the next . the concept and proposal of crows",
    "were introduced in @xmath1 by yariv  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . at that point",
    "it was obvious that such structures would yield big interest in the optical community due to the potential application possibilities  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is clear that near the band edge the group velocity is significantly reduced in the ideal and lossless structure .",
    "unfortunately , a certain level of damping will always be present due to radiation losses , intrinsic losses of materials , and any other mechanism that may dissipate or scatter part of the electromagnetic energy .",
    "any fabrication processes will introduce some variations in the properties of the individual resonators that will serve to dissipate and scatter light propagating in the crow .",
    "such non - uniformities can indeed seriously affect slow light propagation  @xcite , emphasizing the importance of quantifying their effect and unavoidable consequences .",
    "when discussing the potential of slow - light waveguides the emphasis is often on the attainable group index @xmath2 or the group velocity @xmath3 .",
    "however , in applications involving delay lines and buffers , the group delay @xmath4 is the key parameter . obviously , the longer the waveguide the longer the group delay",
    "however , this trivial statement implicitly neglects the decay of the pulse as it propagates down the waveguide and eventually the pulse has lost its initial strength and intensity . in this paper , we treat the issues of delay and decay on an equal footing by emphasizing that the decay length @xmath5 serves as an effective cut off for @xmath6 ( section 2 ) , leaving us with a maximal attainable group delay @xmath7 of the order @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . from coupled - mode theory ( section 3 ) ,",
    "our key observation is that the maximum attainable delay time in crows is limited by the intrinsic photon lifetime of a single resonator ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "the presence of disorder and scattering will further serve to reduce this bound ( section 3.2 ) , as shown numerically with the aid of a green function method ( details given in appendix ) .",
    "finally , conclusions are given ( section 4 ) .",
    "to facilitate quantitative predictions of @xmath7 we imagine a crow of length @xmath6 and the transmission @xmath9 through this segment is then conveniently parameterized by @xmath10 obviously , this parametrization excellently represents the exponential decay of the power associated with absorption and other loss mechanisms captured by the finite @xmath0 factors of the resonators . likewise , in the presence of localization",
    ", the average transmission also has an exponential distribution with the scale given by the localization length .",
    "thus , the length scale @xmath11 captures the combined effects of disorder - induced localization and other loss accounted for by the finite @xmath0-factor .    in the context of pulse delay",
    ", @xmath5 represents an estimate of the maximal length of the crow that we could imagine in any practical application . extending the length @xmath6 of crow beyond @xmath5",
    "would effectively suppress the output power , thus jeopardizing any benefits of slowing down a wave package .",
    "the maximal group delay is thus a balance between a slow group velocity and a long propagation length , i.e. @xmath12 . since the group velocity is also inversely proportional to the density - of - states we may conveniently rewrite this expression as    @xmath13    the key result of this paper is that @xmath7 is always limited by the single - resonator photon lifetime , i.e. @xmath14 where the equality applies to the situation with absence of disorder .    in the following we outline our account for this result by coupled - mode theory and",
    "in particular , we study first the limit of ideal crows ( but with finite @xmath0 ) and subsequently we address the effects of disorder .",
    "we consider a chain of coupled optical resonators , where the @xmath15th resonator , if left isolated from the other resonators , is characterized by a resonant field @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the resonance frequency and @xmath18 represents the resonance line width .",
    "the energy in the resonator @xmath19 then has a lorentzian frequency distribution corresponding to the density - of - states @xmath20 the associated quality factor @xmath21 may conveniently be parametrized as a photon life time @xmath22 .",
    "next , imagine a chain of coupled resonators of the above kind .",
    "we follow the work of yariv and co - workers  @xcite and write the electrical field as a linear combination of the isolated resonator fields , i.e. @xmath23 , where the expansion coefficients are denoted by @xmath24 to emphasize the similarities with the notation in ref .",
    "@xcite for the associated problem of electrons in a quantum wire . in the regime of weak nearest - neighbor coupling",
    "the equations linearize to @xmath25 which has a form resembling the tight - binding chain in condensed matter physics . to further emphasize this connection we write the coupled equations in a matrix form , i.e. @xmath26 , where the hamiltonian matrix @xmath27 has elements @xmath28 with @xmath29 so that the off - diagonal part of @xmath27 is hermitian .      in the case where the resonators are all identical and arranged in a fully periodic sequence , we may without loss of generality suppress all indices , thus making further analytical progress possible .",
    "the electromagnetic states now form a continuous frequency band and the problem is easily diagonalized by the ansatz @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting dispersion relation is of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the complex valued bloch wave vector and @xmath33 is the lattice constant of the periodic arrangement of resonators .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) corresponds to the theory by yariv  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to also include resonators with a finite @xmath0-factor.$ ] where @xmath34 is for simplicity considered real and given by @xmath35 . ]",
    "the group velocity may formally be calculated from the dispersion relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) .",
    "we imagine the situation where the crow is excited by a monochromatic laser with a well - defined frequency of the light .",
    "care should thus be taken that @xmath36 is to be considered real while @xmath37 may be complex , and the group velocity is then formally given by    @xmath38    along the same lines , we may also calculate the density - of - states from the dispersion relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) .",
    "we emphasize , that for the particular case of a one - dimensional chain , the density - of - states is inversely proportional to the group velocity , @xmath39 clearly , a vanishing group velocity will be associated with a diverging density - of - states and vice versa .",
    "this also explains why a light pulse can not completely come to stop in a real system , since no real system will exhibit a true singular density - of - states the inevitable presence of absorption , radiation , and imperfections will serve as effective broadening mechanisms .",
    "nevertheless , to illustrate the basic physics , it is common to consider lossless structures and only focus on the real part of the dispersion properties , since the damping is anyway assumed to be modest .",
    "however , in the present context of slow - light propagation the two issues are not easily separable and care must be taken .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the contrast between a crow made from lossless resonators ( dashed lines ) and finite-@xmath0 resonators ( solid lines ) , respectively .",
    "the left panel illustrates the usual cosine - band dispersion relation , i.e. the relation between the frequency @xmath36 and the real part @xmath40 of the complex - valued bloch wave vector @xmath32 .",
    "likewise , the middle panel illustrates the corresponding damping , i.e. the relation between frequency @xmath36 and the imaginary part @xmath41 of the bloch wave vector .",
    "finally , the right panel shows the density - of - states associated with the dispersion diagram in the left panel .",
    "the difference between the ideal structure ( @xmath42 ) and one employing resonators of finite @xmath0 is easily contrasted by comparing the dashed and solid lines , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that the main cause of a finite @xmath0 factor is to smear out van  hove singularities in the density - of - states and to weaken the slow down of light pulses propagating near the band - edges of the crow .",
    "of course , the finite @xmath0 also introduces damping throughout the entire band , though be most pronounced near the band edges due to slow - light enhanced absorption  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that quite steep bands appear outside the traditional band of extended states , though of course with a significant attenuation as evident from the middle plot illustrating the @xmath41 dependence .    in our previous work",
    "we have carefully discussed the influence of the finite @xmath0 factor on the saturation of the group index  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion is that in the center of the band the group velocity is ( to lowest order in @xmath43 ) insensitive to the finite photon life time . on the other hand , at the band edges , initially supporting pronounced slow down , the group velocity scales quite unfavorably with the @xmath0 factor , making the slow - light regime challenging to explore .    here",
    ", we focus on the attainable group delay when the slow down and the damping is treated on an equal footing . for the ideal crow , the group delay is given by @xmath44 .",
    "however , in the presence of a finite @xmath0 , the length @xmath6 is effectively cut off by the damping length associated with the exponential decay in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) .",
    "this gives an upper bound and eq .",
    "( [ eq : taumax ] ) may in this case formally be rewritten as @xmath45 combining the full results for @xmath40 and @xmath41 and expanding in @xmath43 we get  @xcite @xmath46 the main conclusion from this analytical exercise is that the maximal group delay is limited by the photon life time @xmath47 of the individual resonators , independently on the actual frequency .",
    "while being a quite intuitive results , it has important and overlooked consequences with respect to how much delay one may envision in future designs of optical buffers and delay - line architectures . despite the reduced group velocity near the band edges , the advantage of a slowly advancing wave package is balanced by a reduced propagation length , see the middle panel of fig .",
    "we emphasize that compared to a single resonator , the crow may of course offer the advantage of an increased bandwidth .",
    "likewise , the strongly suppressed group - velocity dispersion at the band center might also be beneficial in some applications .    in the following",
    "we discuss how this result is modified in the presence of disorder .",
    "however , we may at this stage anticipate that disorder may only further limit time delay , thus in general adding the lesser sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taumax < taup ] ) as compared to the equality derived in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taumax_expansion ] ) .",
    "we next turn to disordered waveguides , formally allowing for crows composed of resonators with a resonator - to - resonator fluctuation in the resonance frequency @xmath17 and the linewidth @xmath18 as well as fluctuations in couplings @xmath48 between neighboring resonators . for simplicity",
    "we will neglect fluctuations in the linewidth so that all resonators have the same @xmath0 factor . for the resonance frequencies and the couplings we will further assume uncorrelated gaussian distributions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . the distributions have mean values @xmath51 and @xmath52 corresponding to the ideal crow parameters , while fluctuations @xmath53 and @xmath54 around the mean values can be varied to mimic different strengths of disorder .",
    "we employ a green s function method to calculate the transmission and the density - of - states which allows us to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : taumax ] ) for each member of the ensemble .",
    "the green s function is formally obtained by inverting the matrix @xmath55 . however , since its dimensions are formally infinite we imagine a segment of disordered crow ( containing @xmath56 resonators ) sandwiched between to semi - infinite ideal crows , i.e. with no disorder . with the aid of dyson s equation this apparently unsolvable problem",
    "can fortunately be turned into a matrix problem of finite dimension ( corresponding to the dimension @xmath56 of the disordered segment ) and the retarded green functions of the crow can now be found from a numerical inversion of a sparse @xmath57 matrix problem  @xcite @xmath58^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a unit matrix and the couplings to the two semi - infinite ideal crows are accounted for by a complex - valued frequency dependent self - energy @xmath60 .",
    "the details of this approach are given in the appendix  [ appendix : a ] , which lists expressions how to obtain the transmission @xmath9 and the density - of - states @xmath61 from the green s function @xmath62 .",
    "once the green function is obtained , the maximal time delay , eq .",
    "( [ eq : taumax ] ) , is thus easily evaluated with the aid of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : t_tr ] ) and ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "we take advantage of standard matrix inversion routines to numerically study the statistical properties of large ensembles of disordered crows . in principle",
    "this allows us to study statistical moments to any order , but for simplicity we will here focus on the average properties ( first moment ) and only highlight the crow - to - crow fluctuations ( second moment ) by displaying results for particular members , chosen randomly from the large crow ensemble .    in the panel b ) of the figure  [ fig2 ] we show results for the ensemble - averaged dos ( blue lines ) .",
    "it is clearly seen how disorder , in addition to a finite @xmath0 , serves to further broaden the ensemble - averaged dos near the band edges . comparing these results to the dos associated with one particular realization of the disordered crow ( red line ) , it is however clear that pronounced sample - to - sample fluctuations are to be expected . in particular",
    ", the formation of anderson localized states near the band edges , due to the strong interference of light waves , is apparent .",
    "these fluctuations in the dos are quite naturally inherited by other central quantities , such as the maximal group delay @xmath63 and the transmission @xmath9 . in panel c ) the value of @xmath63 is normalized with photon lifetime in single resonator @xmath64 . for the ensemble - averaged maximal delay time",
    ", disorder is seen to further suppress @xmath7 below the bounds by @xmath64 . however , from a practical point of view it is alarming to see fluctuation comparable to the mean value , as indicated by the strongly fluctuating results for a particular realization of the disorder ( red line ) .",
    "for the transmission in panel d ) we see a similar picture with a strong suppression of the transmission near band edges , but with the pronounced transmission fluctuations appearing throughout the entire band . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed line shows the result of unity transmission ( @xmath65 ) for an ideal crow with infinite @xmath0 , while the green line shows the pronounced suppression of transmission in the presence of a finite @xmath0 , but in the absence of any additional disorder .",
    "the quite abrupt drop in transmission near the band edges is associated with slow - light enhanced absorption  @xcite as compared to the center of the band where slow - light enhancement is almost absent .",
    "there is an interesting interplay between the finite @xmath0 factor and the amount of disorder in the structure . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we plot @xmath66 as a function of disorder strength @xmath67 , evaluated for a frequency corresponding to the band center .",
    "the different curves represent different values of the @xmath0 factor .",
    "quite intuitively , the lower the @xmath0 value the less sensitive is the result to disorder , keeping in mind that @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath68 themselves would be heavily suppressed in the presence of a low @xmath0 . for higher @xmath0 values",
    ", it consequently becomes increasingly challenging , in terms of disorder , to take full advantage of the high intrinsic photon life time @xmath64 .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived an explicit relation for the dispersion relation of crows made from resonators with a finite @xmath0 factor .",
    "a finite @xmath0 profoundly influences the van  hove singularities near the band edges with a resulting limitation of the group index while at the center of the band the dispersion properties are less affected .",
    "simple analytical expressions are supported by calculations of the group velocity , demonstrating how the @xmath0 enters on an equal footing with the coupling @xmath52 corresponding to the competing time scales associated with photon decay and tunneling . in the context of practical applications involving the group delay",
    ", we note that the maximal attainable group delay appears as a balance between the reduced group velocity and the the decay length .",
    "explicit calculations show that irrespectively of the underlying bandstructure , the maximal group delay is limited by the photon life time of the resonators .",
    "this illustrates the importance of addressing propagation loss and slow - light on an equal footing .",
    "any inevitable presence of disorder will serve to further suppress the attainable group delay and pronounced sample - to - sample fluctuations may arise .",
