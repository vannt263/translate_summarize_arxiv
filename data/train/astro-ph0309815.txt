    "it is clearly admitted nowadays that the element abundances observed in stellar outer layers by spectroscopy do not necessarily reflect the chemical composition inside the stars .",
    "this composition may be altered by microscopic diffusion or by accretion , modulated by the macroscopic motions which may occur below the outer convective zones , namely rotation - induced mixing , internal waves or mass motions induced by stellar winds    the importance of element settling inside stars ( also called  microscopic diffusion \" ) was first recognized as an explanation for the so - calledchemically peculiar stars \" ( michaud 1970 , michaud et al .",
    "1976 , vauclair et al . 1978a and",
    "b ) . at that time , it was presented as  the diffusion hypothesis \" , which appeared as a special process added in some cases to account for stellar abundance peculiarities .",
    "the fact that element settling is a fundamental process which must occur in most stars , including the so - called  normal \" stars , has been proved by helioseismic investigations ( gough et al 1996 ) .",
    "it was known for a long time that helium and metals should have diffused by about @xmath0 down from the solar convective zone since the birth of the sun up to now ( aller and chapman 1960 ) .",
    "comparisons between the sound velocity inside the sun as computed in the models and as deduced from the inversion of seismic modes , confirmed that this settling really occurred .",
    "element settling is now introduced in most computations of stellar models as a  standard process \" . a star is a self - gravitational gaseous sphere , composed of a mixture of various gases with different partial pressures , masses and atomic spectra . due to the pressure and thermal gradients and to the selective radiative transfer , individual elements diffuse one with respect to the other , leading to a slow but effective restructuration .",
    "it is more difficult , in this framework , to understand why the consequences of diffusion processes are not seen in all the stars than to explain abundance anomalies .",
    "it is also not easy to account for the fact that , in chemically peculiar stars , the observed anomalies are not as strong as predicted by the theory of pure microscopic diffusion : these questions are related to the hydrodynamical processes which occur in stellar radiative zones and compete with element settling , thereby increasing the time scale of abundance variations .    in the following sections , i will discuss the interaction between element settling and stellar oscillations in two parts : 1 ) element settling as a stabilizing or an exciting process for triggering stellar oscillations ; 2 ) asteroseismology as a test of element settling inside stars .",
    "the variations of the chemical composition inside the stars , which result from element settling , can in some cases lead to the stabilization of layers which would otherwise trigger oscillations ( e.g. helium depletion in am stars ) .",
    "in other cases it can help destabilizing a star which would otherwise be stable against pulsations ( e.g. iron accumulation in some peculiar stars , or helium diffusion in roap stars ) .",
    "inside the convective regions , the rapid macroscopic motions mix the gas components and force their abundance homogenization . the chemical composition observed in the external regions of cool stars",
    "is thus affected by the settling which occurs below the outer convective zones , while in hot stars diffusion occurs directly in the atmosphere , which may lead to abundance gradients or  clouds \" in the spectroscopically observed region . as the settling time scales vary , in first approximation , like the inverse of the density , the expected variations are smaller for cooler stars , which have deeper convective zones . while some elements can see their abundances vary by several orders of magnitude in the hottest ap stars , the abundance variations in the sun are not larger than a few @xmath1 .    while gravitational settling and thermal diffusion lead to a downward motion of all the elements other than hydrogen , selective radiative transfer may push some elements upwards .",
    "this is due to the fact that the elements absorb photons which basically come from the internal layers of the star and re - emit these photons in an isotropic way , thereby gaining a net momentum upwards .",
    "this absorption may take place through the continuum ( ionization ) or through the lines ( excitation of the ions ) . in practice",
    "the line process is much more significant than the continuum .",
    "radiative accelerations on individual ions strongly depend on their atomic characteristics , which have to be precisely known .",
    "they also depend on the sharing of the photon flux with the other elements .",
    "it represents the same kind of problems as those encountered for the computations of stellar opacities .",
    "this is the reason why the most precise computations presently done on radiative accelerations are the result of collaborations between stellar physicists specialists of diffusion processes and atomic physicists specialists of opacity computations .",
    "the importance of the radiative accelerations on individual elements increase with the effective temperature ( michaud et al 1976 ) . while it is negligible for the sun ( turcotte et al 1998 ) , it becomes larger than the gravity for most elements in hotter stars ( alecian , michaud , tully 1993 , turcotte , richer and michaud 1998 , richer et al 1998 , turcotte et al 2000 ) .",
    "the montreal models are presently the only ones which include step by step in the computations the modification of the stellar internal structure induced by the abundance variations .",
    "approximation formulae for the general computations of radiative accelerations have been derived by alecian and leblanc 2000 and 2002 .",
    "the radiative accelerations on the elements vary with depth , according to their ionization stage .",
    "it may happen to be smaller than gravity at some depth and larger than gravity below .",
    "in this case there is an accumulation of the considered element at that special depth , even if it is depleted in the outer layers .",
    "this is the case , for example , for iron inside b , a and f stars ( richard , michaud , richer 2001 , richard et al 2002 ) .",
    "it is then possible that a new convective zone , due to this iron accumulation , takes place inside the star , thereby changing the way diffusion processes behave .",
    "note that the same phenomenon occurs in horizontal branch stars and is supposed to be the reason for the oscillations of  sdb stars \" ( charpinet et al 1997 ) .      among the main sequence stars which lie inside the instability strip ,",
    "many chemically peculiar stars are found .",
    "the magnetic stars will be discussed below . here",
    "i focus on the so - called am stars , which are found in the h.r .",
    "diagram at the same place as the @xmath2-scuti stars . generally speaking ,",
    "the former ones show abundance peculiarities , namely a general overabundance of metals ( except calcium and scandium ) , but no oscillations , while the later ones are pulsating but chemically normal .",
    "as discussed by turcotte et al ( 2000 ) , in a - type stars , almost @xmath3 of non chemically peculiar stars are @xmath2-scuti variables at current levels of sensitivity while most non - variable stars are am stars .",
    "furthermore , am stars are slower rotators than @xmath2-scuti stars .",
    "this lead baglin ( 1972 ) to suggest a dichotomy between the two kinds of stars .",
    "in this region of the h.r .",
    "diagram , the stars display two different convective zones in their outer layers : the upper one due to the hi and hei ionisations and the lower one to the heii ionisation .",
    "the @xmath2-scuti pulsate due to a @xmath4-mechanism which takes place in the second convective zone .",
    "when microscopic diffusion occurs , this convective zone disappears due to helium depletion and the @xmath5-mechanism can not take place anymore ( vauclair , vauclair and pamjatnikh 1974 )",
    ".    more recently however , some oscillating am stars have been discovered ( kurtz 1989 , kurtz et al 1995 , martinez et al 1999 , joshi et al 2002 ) , which challenge the previously accepted theory .",
    "richer , michaud and turcotte ( 2000 ) and turcotte et al ( 2000 ) computed models of am stars in the framework of the montreal models .",
    "they found that , due to the iron accumulation in the radiative zone below the h and he convective zone , a new convective region appears which increases the diffusion time scales compared to the previous models . in these new models ,",
    "helium is still substantially present in the helium convective zone at the ages of the considered stars .",
    "they claim that it is possible to account for the existence of oscillating am stars close to the cool boundary of the instability strip . in all these computations ,",
    "the different convective zones are assumed to be completely connected by overshooting .",
    "this assumption , first proposed by latour et al 1976 and toomre et al 1976 , is still supported by recent numerical computations ( toomre , private communication ) .",
    "rapidly oscillating ap stars are very complex objects , due to their magnetic structure ( kurtz 2000 ) .",
    "the models which have been proposed up to now are much too simple to be able to account for all their features .",
    "dolez , gough and vauclair ( 1988 ) and vauclair , dolez and gough ( 1991 ) proposed that the oscillations in roap stars could be driven by @xmath4-mechanism in the heii ionisation zone .",
    "as helium is always depleted by diffusion , the idea was that a wind could exist at the magnetic poles , creating a helium overabundance .",
    "this model was supposed to be the continuation for cool stars of the model proposed by vauclair ( 1975 ) to account for helium rich stars . in cooler stars",
    ", the accumulation should not be visible in the atmosphere , but it should still occur at the place where helium becomes neutral ( first ionisation zone ) . as the @xmath4-mechanism is driven by the second ionisation zone , the helium accumulation could be efficient only if it was large enough so that its downward wing could appreciably extent down to this region .",
    "this model for roap stars has been challenged by balmforth et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who computed the driving of the modes with different helium profiles at the magnetic poles and equator .",
    "they found that , contrary to what was assumed before , a helium accumulation induced by diffusion in a wind does not help driving the pulsations . on the contrary ,",
    "the excitation of the modes is more important when there is less helium in the atmosphere , the basic driving mechanism being induced by hydrogen ionization ( this was already suggested by dziembowski and goode 1996 ) .",
    "meanwhile the magnetic equator damps the oscillations due to energy loss by turbulence in the remaining convection zone : this could explain why oscillations aligned with the magnetic axis are preferentially excited in these stars . in this respect ,",
    "recent spectroscopic observations which show evidences of abundance stratification in roap stars which are not seen in noap stars may give interesting clues ( gelbmann et al 2000 , ryabchikova et al 2002 ) .",
    "owing to helioseismology , the sound velocity inside the sun is known with a precision of @xmath6 and gives evidence of the occurrence of helium settling as predicted by diffusion computations .",
    "solar models computed in the old  standard \" way , in which the element settling is totally neglected , do not agree with the inversion of the seismic modes . this result has been obtained by many authors , in different ways ( see gough et al 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "there is a characteristic discrepancy of a few percent , just below the convective zone , between the sound velocity computed in the models and that of the seismic sun .",
    "introducing the element settling considerably improves the consistency with the seismic sun , but some discrepancies do remain , particularly below the convective zone where a peak appears in the sound velocity .",
    "the reason of this peak is probably due to the steepness of the @xmath7-gradient induced by pure microscopic diffusion ( richard et al 1996 ) .",
    "the helium profiles directly obtained from helioseismology ( basu 1997 and 1998 , antia and chitre 1998 ) show indeed a helium gradient below the convective zone which is smoother than the gradient obtained with pure settling .",
    "introduction of macroscopic motions in competition with the settling slightly smoothes down the helium gradient , and may rub out the peak , although some differences still remain between the models and the seismic inversion results ( brun , turck - chize , zahn 1999 , richard , thado and vauclair 2002 ) .",
    "such motions are also needed to reproduce the observed abundances of light elements , namely a lithium depletion by about 140 compared to the protosolar value while beryllium is normal ( balachandran and bell 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , observations of the @xmath8he/@xmath9he ratio in the solar wind and in the lunar rocks ( geiss and gloecker 1998 ) show that this ratio may not have increased by more than @xmath1 during the past 3 gyr in the sun . while the occurrence of some mild mixing below the solar convective zone",
    "is needed to explain the lithium depletion and helps for the conciliation of the models with helioseismological constraints , the @xmath8he/@xmath9he observations put a strict constraint on its efficiency .",
    "the effect of @xmath10-gradients on the mixing processes has to be invoked to explain these observations in a consistent way .",
    "oscillations of solar type stars have already been observed from ground based instruments ( bouchy and carrier 2003 )",
    ". future space missions like corot and eddington will hopefully bring important new data .",
    "we have begun to study the oscillations of stellar models including or not diffusion or metal accretion , with the aim to test special signatures of these processes .",
    "the models are iterated so that their external parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , log @xmath13 , metallicity ) are the same while their past history , and accordingly their present internal structure , are different .",
    "complete results will be presented elsewhre ( thado et al 2004 , bazot and vauclair 2004 ) . here",
    "we show some preliminary results : figure 1 displays evolutionary tracks for 1.2 m@xmath14 stars , with and without diffusion , iterated so that the outer stellar parameters remain quite similar ( castro 2003 ) .",
    "oscillation frequencies have been computed for the models corresponding to the crossing point , which have the same luminosity and temperature : log@xmath15 and log@xmath16 .",
    "figure 2 displays , for the two models , the  second differences \" , namely @xmath17 . as pointed out by gough 1989 , these  second differences \" present characteristic oscillations due to the partial reflexion of the sound waves on the regions of rapid variations of the sound velocity .",
    "figure 2 shows clearly that they differ in the two models .",
    "detailed analysis of all these effects is presently underway .",
