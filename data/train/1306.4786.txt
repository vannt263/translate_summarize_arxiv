    "black holes have no hair , meaning that they have no distinguishing features , other than mass and spin ( charge is negligible in an astrophysical setting ) .",
    "however , they are most easily observed via a luminous accretion flow , so mass accretion rate is another important quantity in determining their appearance , with a weak dependence on inclination angle .",
    "thus there are only four parameters , and yet there is a wide diversity in the observed properties of agn .",
    "while the black hole mass and mass accretion rate can be reasonably well determined , spin only leaves an imprint on the space - time close to the event horizon , so is hard to measure .",
    "hence it is often the first candidate to explain any property which is not well understood , such as the emergence of powerful radio jets ( e.g. begelman , blandford & rees 1984 ) , feedback from which controls the star formation powered growth of galaxies ( e.g. bower et al 2006 ) . however , spin has wider importance as it preserves the history of how the mass of the black hole grows over cosmic time ( volonteri et al 2005 ; fanidakis et al 2011 ) , determines the gravitational wave signature arising from black hole coalescence in galaxy mergers ( centrella et al 2010 ) , and whether the resulting black hole is likely to be ejected from the host galaxy ( king et al 2008 ) .    currently , the only well established method to measure black hole spin in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is from the iron k@xmath1 line profile .",
    "x - ray illumination of the accretion disc gives rise to a fluorescent iron k@xmath1 line at 6.4 - 7 kev and associated continuum reflection , both of which are sculpted by special and general relativistic effects .",
    "larger line widths require material closer to the black hole , and hence imply higher spin ( fabian et al 1989 ; 2000 ) .",
    "a range of black hole spins are found with this technique ( e.g the compilations of nandra et al 2007 ; brenneman & reynolds 2009 ; de la calle perez et al 2010 ) , but a subset of low luminosity spectra from the most variable narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies ( gallo 2006 ) show dramatically broad iron features .",
    "these require extreme spin if these are produced primarily through relativistic reflection e.g. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al 2001 ; fabian et al 2002 ; brenneman & reynolds 2006 ; miniutti et al 2007 ; chiang & fabian 2011 ) , and 1h0707 - 495 ( fabian et al 2004 ; 2009 ) . however , the models developed to explain these low luminosity datasets are extreme , not just in terms of black hole spin , but also in requiring a source geometry where the continuum can be strongly gravitationally focussed onto the inner disc to give reflection dominated spectra and an extremely centrally concentrated emissivity ( fabian et al 2004 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ; fabian et al 2009 ; zoghbi et al 2010 ) .",
    "these extreme parameters motivated alternative models where the spectral curvature around the iron line is instead produced by complex absorption ( e.g. mkn 766 : turner et al 2007 ; miller et al 2007 ; mcg-6 - 30 - 15 : miller et al 2009 ) .",
    "the broad features are then indicative of winds and feedback from the agn rather than black hole spin ( sim et al 2010 ; tatum et al 2012 ) .",
    "there is hope that the controversy over the nature of the spectra may be settled using new combined spectral - timing analysis techniques ( fabian et al 2009 ; wilkins et al 2013 but see legg et al 2012 ) and/or new high energy data from nustar ( risaliti et al 2013 but see miller & turner 2013 ) .",
    "however , the current debate even on these topics highlights the need for another method to measure of black hole spin .",
    "one possibilitity is from the soft x - ray excess , an additional component seen ubiquitously in agn alongside the expected disc and high energy power - law tail .",
    "if this is also formed from reflection , then black hole spin can be constrained by the amount of relativistic smearing of the soft x - ray lines as well as the iron k@xmath1 line ( crummy et al 2006 ) . however ,",
    "this remains controversial , as the soft x - ray excess may instead be a separate continuum component ( see section 2 , below ) .",
    "instead , there is another well studied method to measure black hole spin which is routinely applied to galactic black holes binaries ( bhb ) .",
    "these can have accretion disc spectra which peak at x - ray energies , as expected from standard disc models ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "a single measure of the peak temperature , @xmath2 , and total disc luminosity , @xmath3 , give an estimate of black hole spin when the system parameters ( black hole mass , inclination and distance ) are known . this derived size scale is observed to remain constant despite large changes in mass accretion rate , giving confidence in the standard disc models ( ebisawa et al 1991 ; 1993 ; kubota et al 2001 , gierlinski & done 2004 ; davis , done & blaes 2006 ; steiner et al 2010 ) .",
    "however , this constant radius ( i.e. @xmath4 behaviour is only seen when the disc dominates the spectrum .",
    "the reconstruction of the disc intrinsic luminosity and temperature becomes progressively more model dependent where the high energy tail contributes more than @xmath5% of the bolometric luminosity , hence such data are not reliable estimators of black hole spin ( kubota et al 2001 ; kubota & done 2004 ; steiner et al 2010 ) .",
    "this technique has not been widely used in agn , predominantly because the predicted disc spectra depend on both black hole mass and mass accretion rate , so without a good mass estimate it is not possible to accurately determine the position of the peak disc emission .",
    "however , generically this peak should lie in the uv region , which can not be directly observed in low redshift agn due to interstellar absorption , so there was no strong motivation to study this further .",
    "agn spectra are also generally not dominated by the thermal disc component , but have substantial luminosity at higher energies ( elvis et al 1994 ; richards et al 2006 ) i.e. where bhb show that spin determination from the disc continuum component is not robust .",
    "there are three key factors which allow us to now apply this technique to some agn to constrain their black hole spin .",
    "firstly , black hole mass in agn can now be estimated via scaling relationships based on the optical broad line region widths ( e.g kaspi et al 2000 ) . the optical continuum from the disc",
    "then directly measures the mass accretion rate through the outer disc ( with a weak dependence on inclination : davis & laor 2011 ) .",
    "secondly , we have recently identified a new class of agn , whose spectra are dominated by the disc ( jin et al 2012a ; b hereafter j12a , b and done et al 2012 ; hereafter d12 ; terashima et al 2012 ) .",
    "these do have a high energy tail and a soft x - ray excess , but the luminosity in these components is small compared to the disc emission .",
    "hence they form a subset of objects where disc continuum fitting model can be used with some confidence .",
    "these objects are all nls1 , so have low mass black holes , and high mass accretion rates ( boroson 2002 ) .",
    "this combination gives the highest predicted disc temperatures , peaking in the euv rather than the uv , so increasing spin leads to the wien tail of the disc emission extending into the observable soft x - ray bandpass ( d12 ) .",
    "thirdly , we have developed new improved disc models which approximately incorporate the results of full radiative transfer through the disc photosphere via a colour temperature correction to the blackbody temperature ( d12 ) .",
    "such models have previously only been widely available for spectral fitting stellar mass black holes in binary systems ( li et al 2005 ) .",
    "we demonstrate the technique using pg 1244 + 026 , a bright , low redshift ( z = 0.048 , corresponding to d = 211 mpc ) disc - dominated nls1 agn ( j12a , b , see also figs [ fig : pg1244_opt ] and [ fig : pg1244_conv ] ) , where absorption corrections to both the uv and soft x - ray emission are small due to the low column along the line of sight .",
    "this is not one of the nls1 which shows a low flux state , so does not have the extreme iron line features , but instead has a relatively simple x - ray continuum shape ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : pg1244_opt ] and [ fig : pg1244_conv ] ) .",
    "we use a new , 100ks , high quality dataset from the xmm - newton satellite ( see jin et al 2013 , hereafter j13 ) to improve statistics over those of j12a , b , and to determine the black hole mass via x - ray variability as well as the h@xmath6 line width . using",
    "the maximum mass produces a lower limit on the disc temperature which strongly requires low spin in order not to overpredict the observed soft x - ray flux . extending the agn continuum model of d12 to include relativistic effects ,",
    "inclination dependence and advection does not substantially change this conclusion .",
    "a low spin for this nls1 is in sharp contrast with the high spin derived for other nls1 which show low flux episodes described above .",
    "our x - ray data are not sufficient to derive the profile of the iron line with high confidence , so we can not yet say whether the low spin determination in this object is in conflict with its iron line profile .",
    "better high energy data are required in order to determine whether this new method gives a spin estimate which is consistent with that derived from the iron line , or whether it instead reveals a lack of understanding of disc continuum emission and/or of disc reflection .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "there is an iron line in the x - ray data , but there is not sufficient signal - to - noise in the 3 - 10  kev bandpass to use this to tightly constrain the black hole spin ( see j13 for details ) .",
    "hence we can not currently compare the two techniques in this object .",
    "however , reflection may also form the soft x - ray excess .",
    "this is an alternative model to the one used here where we assumed that the soft excess was a true additional component .",
    "fitting the entire x - ray spectrum of pg1244 + 026 with ionised reflection models strongly requires high spin ( crummy et al 2006 ; j13 ) , in conflict with the disc continuum fits above .",
    "however , the lack of correlated variability of the soft x - ray excess with that of the hard power law argues against a reflection origin for the majority of the soft x - ray excess in this object ( j13 ) , so the black hole spin estimate from reflection fits to the soft x - ray excess are probably not valid in this object .",
    "this is the first demonstration that black hole spin in a nls1 can be constrained from disc continuum fitting .",
    "the only previous application of this technique in agn was for a very high mass black hole accreting at moderate rate ( @xmath7 ) where the disc peak is resolved in the observable optical / uv due to the high source redshift of @xmath8 ( czerny et al 2011 ) .",
    "instead , our study uses the lack of an observed peak in the soft x - ray range to constrain spin in a local , much lower mass black hole , higher mass accretion rate agn .",
    "these nls1 are an important class of agn as these are typically the systems where extreme relativistic effects requiring high spin and gravitational lightbending are claimed from the shape of the reflected iron line emission during low flux episodes , where the spectra appear reflection dominated .",
    "these are interpreted in the lightbending model as due to the continuum source dropping in height so that strong lightbending both suppresses the intrinsic power law emitted towards the observer , and enhances the illumination of the very innermost parts of the disc , leading to a strongly centrally peaked emissivity ( fabian et al 2004 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "the higher flux spectra from these objects are much less reflection dominated and their reflection emissivity is less centrally concentrated , consistent with a larger source height where lightbending is less effective .",
    "our low spin result for pg1244 + 026 is in sharp contrast with the high ( almost maximal ) spin required to fit the low flux episodes of the nls1 1h0707 - 495 ( fabian et al 2004 ; 2009 ) .",
    "while these are different objects , they have similar mass and mass accretion rates , and the x - ray spectrum of 1h0707 - 495 in its high flux episodes is remarkably similar to that of pg1244 + 026 .",
    "cosmological simulations of the co - evolution of black holes in agn and their host galaxies predict that low mass black holes should all have similar spins as they are built from the same process ( gas accretion rather than merging black holes ) .",
    "these should all have high spin if the accretion angular momentum direction is prolonged , or all low if the accretion is chaotic ( e.g. fanidakis et al 2011 ) .",
    "hence our result implies that either our disc continuum spin estimate is wrong , or the reflection dominated interpretation of the low flux state spectra are wrong , or that our understanding of the cosmological evolution of black hole spin is wrong .",
    "we discuss each of these possibilities in turn below .",
    "the disc continuum fit could underestimate spin if the mass were significantly underestimated .",
    "this does not seem likely given the very narrow line widths in this object and its rapid x - ray variability ( see section 3 ) .",
    "alternatively , advection could become much more important if the black hole mass were instead towards the lower limit of the probable range . while a very super - eddington mass accretion rate would not be an issue for a single object",
    ", we note that the high @xmath9 sample of j12a , b all have similar x - ray spectra and masses , so probably will all have similarly low spin constraints . with the current models these",
    "agn all have @xmath10 , following smoothly on from the other two subsamples which have @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( j12a , b , d12 ) .",
    "if instead all these objects were super - eddington there would be a deficit of systems with mass accretion rate around @xmath10 .",
    "the only other possibility is that the disc models themselves are wrong , despite being solidly tested in the bhb systems .",
    "the most significant difference made by increasing the mass is that the disc temperature decreases .",
    "this means that the disc can power a uv line driven wind ( proga et al 2000 ; risaliti & elvis 2010 ) and mass loss in this wind could be substantial enough to change the disc structure ( laor & davis 2013 ) .",
    "alternatively , the high spin derived from x - ray reflection models for the x - ray low states of nls1 such as 1h0707 - 495 could be overestimated",
    ". this can be the case if most of the soft x - ray excess is a true additional continuum but is erroneously fit with reflection models .",
    "the strong relativistic effects required to smear the predicted soft x - ray line emission into the observed continuum then drive the fit , as the statistics at low energies are much better than at the iron line e.g. most of the objects in crummy et al ( 2006 ) require high spin at high significance .",
    "however , the low flux spectra which most strongly require high spin are often fit with two reflectors , one for the soft x - ray excess , and another for the iron line but the iron line alone strongly requires high spin in 1h0707 - 495 ( fabian et al 2009 ) . instead , the curvature around the iron line could be due to absorption rather than to relativisitic effects ( turner et al 2007 ; miller et al 2007 ) .",
    "this appears to require a fine - tuning of the geometry ( zoghbi et al 2011 ) but these extreme line profiles are only seen in a subset of nls1 , those where the flux drops dramatically ( gallo 2006 ) which may select objects where the line of sight is directly down the wind .",
    "alternatively , the reflection spectrum could itself be distorted if the disc photosphere is strongly turbulent and/or dominated by compton scattering , as predicted for the inner regions of the disc in the failed wind / hitchhiking gas model of risaliti & elvis ( 2010 ) .",
    "finally , the cosmological spin evolution could be wrong .",
    "this seems almost certain as the models only include spin up / down from accretion and black hole mergers , yet these objects also can power jets at some stages of their active lifetimes",
    ". the jet may remove angular momentum from the black hole if it is powered by the blandford - znajek process though this is also still controversial as the jet could also be powered simply by accretion e.g. russell , gallo & fender ( 2013 ) .",
    "this paper demonstrates that disc continuum fitting can constrain black hole spin in agn , though there are still systematic uncertainties from black hole mass determinations which require reverberation mapping to substantially reduce .",
    "applying the continuum fitting technique to a sample of disc dominated agn to derive the spin distribution will give new insight into current controversies which beset the interpretation of x - ray spectra .",
    "more fundamentally , measuring black hole spin reliably would give a test of the origin of jet power , and shed new light on the nature of the accretion powered growth of super - massive black holes across cosmic time .",
    "cd acknowledges a conversation with ric davies at mpe where in describing the need for new data to use the disc continuum fitting technique in agn , it became clear that this was already feasible ."
