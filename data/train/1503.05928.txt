    "<S> two - point correlation functions of cosmic microwave background polarization provide a physically independent probe of the surprising suppression of correlations in the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies at large angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate correlation functions constructed from both the q and u stokes parameters and from the e and b polarization components . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution to these correlation functions comes from local physical effects at the last scattering surface or from the epoch of reionization at high redshift , so all should be suppressed if the temperature suppression is due to an underlying lack of correlations in the cosmological metric perturbations larger than a given scale . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the correlation functions for the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology constrained by the observed temperature correlation function , and compute statistics characterizing their suppression on large angular scales . </S>",
    "<S> future full - sky polarization maps with minimal systematic errors on large angular scales will provide strong tests of whether the observed temperature correlation function is a statistical fluke or reflects a fundamental shortcoming of the standard cosmological model . </S>"
