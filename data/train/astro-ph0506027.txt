    "understanding the origin of magnetic activity in stars has been an important research area in astronomy and astrophysics for many years . imaged solar observations show a clear link between magnetic fields and the formation of heated plasma in the chromosphere , transition region and corona , especially in active regions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "active regions are believed to form from loops of magnetic flux that emerge from the base of the solar convection zone ( see e.g. , reviews by @xcite ) . the large - scale magnetic field on the sun",
    "is believed to originate via a global - scale dynamo , powered mainly by the velocity shear ( differential rotation ) between the convection zone and the radiative interior .",
    "it is often assumed that the amount of differential rotation increases as the rotation rate itself increases .",
    "for example , theoretical studies of differential rotation mechanisms such as the `` @xmath0 effect '' @xcite find that the amount of differential rotation generated by reynolds stresses is proportional to the rotation rate .",
    "@xcite was among the first to propose an observational connection between rotation rate and the level of activity in stars through dynamo action .",
    "@xcite went on to show a clear correlation between the h+k surface flux and rotation rate , arguing that the correlation is made better with the inclusion of a convective turnover time via the rossby number .",
    "@xcite finds a similar result for chromospheric , transition region , and coronal emission diagnostics .",
    "@xcite shows that the activity of dwarf and rs cvn stars both correlate well with rotation rate , but with a slight offset between the two classes of stars , while the two classes appear to follow the same relationship when the rotation period is divided by the convective turnover time ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these studies provide strong observational support for the existence of the so - called @xmath1-@xmath2 dynamo ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which relies on the interaction of convection and rotation  specifically , differential rotation ( the `` @xmath2 '' effect ) and field regeneration by cyclonic motions ( the `` @xmath1 '' effect )  to generate a magnetic field in a fashion similar to that believed responsible for the large - scale solar dynamo .    for cool stars ,",
    "a straightforward application of the relationship between stellar rotation and magnetic activity described above leads one to conclude that those stars that rotate slowly or do not rotate ( hereafter collectively termed `` non - rotating stars '' ) should show little or no activity diagnostics .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "there appears to be a lower limit to the emission of activity indicators in the chromosphere , transition region , and corona .",
    "given the expected absence of a global dynamo in non - rotating stars , this heating is usually attributed to a `` basal '' non - magnetic mechanism such as heating by acoustic waves . @xcite",
    "first introduced the term `` basal flux density '' to refer to that portion of the chromospheric and transition region line emission which results from a process other than the solar - like cyclic dynamo activity ( termed `` excess '' emission ) .",
    "evidence for a basal flux and the contention that it is acoustic in origin has been based on three observational arguments .",
    "first , plots of the h+k chromospheric flux ( as observed in the mt .",
    "wilson hk project , @xcite ) versus stellar color show a lower boundary up against which the stellar observations appear to cluster @xcite . such a lower boundary is also apparent in other diagnostics such as h and k and @xcite as well as in , , and @xcite .",
    "a second line of analysis examines flux - flux diagrams for samples of stars and seeks to make these as tight as possible by subtracting a color dependent basal emission level from one or more of the diagnostics under consideration @xcite .",
    "the basal emission level is suggested to be acoustic in origin , while the `` excess '' above this level is believed to be magnetic in origin . in cases where a basal flux is determined from these flux - flux studies ,",
    "its value is similar to the lower limit of the flux found in flux - color diagrams .",
    "a third argument for the existence of a basal flux comes from studies connecting rotation and activity .",
    "@xcite extrapolate the color dependent rotation - activity relationship in h+k to zero rotation velocity , finding a non - zero activity level which they identify as the basal flux level .",
    "this procedure produces a color dependent basal emission similar in strength to that found from flux - color and flux - flux analyses , and this basal emission is again argued to be non - magnetic in origin .",
    "theoretical estimates of the acoustic heating of chromospheres have been in the literature for some time ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "we mention here only some of the more recent results which now show good agreement with the observationally inferred basal emission levels .",
    "@xcite compute time dependent models of basal heating for monochromatic acoustic wave models , solving the hydrodynamic equations together with the radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations in order to predict basal emission levels in both the h+k and h+k diagnostics .",
    "these models produce the observed dependence of the lower bound of emission with stellar color , though the magnitude of the emission depends rather sensitively on whether complete or partial redistribution is assumed for the line transfer .",
    "unfortunately , partial redistribution works best for while complete redistribution gives a closer match to the observations .",
    "@xcite extend their acoustic wave models to lower mass column densities and find the formation of a relatively cool corona ( @xmath3 mk ) when applied to f stars and to m dwarfs ( @xmath4@xmath5 mk ) .",
    "while this temperature for m dwarfs is lower than the coronal temperatures found observationally for both dme and dm stars @xcite , @xcite do find that their acoustically heated models can produce a surface flux in excess of that observed on the least x - ray active dm stars .",
    "given the relative success of wave propagation models at predicting the basal level of chromospheric ( and possibly coronal ) emission , @xcite examined high spectral resolution observations of lines in basal level stars and in quiet regions on the sun to look for evidence of upward propagating shock waves as predicted by acoustic heating models .",
    "no such evidence was found , prompting @xcite to call into question the non - magnetic origin for basal emission .",
    "the role of basal flux in the observed x - ray emission is more uncertain observationally compared to chromospheric and transition region diagnostics .",
    "the early flux - flux studies @xcite did not attempt to find a basal level in soft x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite did find a strongly color dependent lower bound on the x - ray emission of stars in his sample , but this was likely due to instrumental detection limits , as the recent volume limited study by @xcite clearly shows that the lower bound on x - ray emission in cool stars has a very weak color dependence at best ; which , if it exists , is in the opposite sense to that found by @xcite . while their x - ray data probably suffered from detection limitations , it should be noted that @xcite do not find a basal level to the x - ray emission  they find that all of the x - ray emission is `` excess '' in nature , and therefore likely magnetic in origin . in a later study , @xcite argued that the observed x - ray emission from late a and early f dwarfs is basal ( and therefore acoustic ) in nature , while @xcite and @xcite have argued that 90% or more of the x - ray emission from dm stars is basal ( acoustic ) in origin .    in the more recent , volume - limited study of nearby stars , @xcite finds that essentially all stars with outer convection zones emit x - rays with characteristics similar to the solar coronal emission",
    ". it seems , therefore , that all `` cool stars '' possess coronae . do they then also possess magnetic fields ?",
    "@xcite notes that for the nearby cool stars , there is a well defined minimum x - ray surface flux of @xmath6 ( in cgs units ) which appears largely independent of stellar color .",
    "such a lower bound to the x - ray emission is reminiscent of the idea of `` basal '' surface flux in chromospheric and transition region emission in cool stars , which is usually assumed to be acoustic in origin , as noted above .",
    "recent work analyzing both solar and stellar data @xcite indicates a clear and unambiguous relationship between unsigned magnetic flux and coronal x - ray emission that extends over twelve orders of magnitude . in that paper ,",
    "observations ranging from small patches of the quiet sun to the most active pre - main sequence stars were analyzed . at the small - scale end of this study , kitt peak magnetograms and yohkoh sxt images",
    "were averaged over a @xmath7 heliographic degree square area centered at the equator and central meridian of the sun , with reported magnetic fluxes and x - ray fluences normalized to a single arc - second square area on the solar disk , corresponding to the approximate size of a single kitt peak magnetogram pixel @xcite .",
    "this study lends further credence to the idea that at least for x - ray emission , a `` basal '' heating mechanism may indeed be magnetic in origin , but unlike the `` excess '' emission from global fields , the magnetic flux has little or no connection to stellar rotation .",
    "high resolution observations of the sun indicate a viable magnetic origin for this `` basal '' magnetic activity emission : the existence of a small - scale magnetic component which appears to exist independent of the large - scale fields that define the solar cycle , and which had been predicted to be generated locally by turbulent convective motions @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the small - scale magnetic field on the sun from the mdi instrument on soho @xcite find strong evidence that small - scale mixed - polarity magnetic concentrations observed in the quiet sun show only a weak solar - cycle dependence . by studying the detailed evolution of this field over time scales of roughly one day ,",
    "the authors conclude that this flux is formed by the emergence of small - scale bipoles ( e.g. , ephemeral active regions , @xcite ) and dissipated by flux cancellation , where the collision of two opposite polarities appears to result in their mutual disappearance @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate a flux replenishment time scale of forty hours , while the more recent study of @xcite estimate a replenishment time scale of sixteen hours . in any case , the quiet sun magnetic flux  however it is generated  appears to correctly predict the x - ray fluence for the quiet sun in the study of @xcite .",
    "more recent observations @xcite using spectropolarimetric instruments in conditions of extremely good seeing have found evidence of a mixed polarity magnetic field on even smaller , sub - granulation spatial scales .",
    "taken together , these measurements imply that turbulent convection may produce a small - scale mixed polarity field over a very wide range of spatial scales in the sun .    complementing the observational evidence for small - scale magnetic fields is a broad base of theoretical work .",
    "research in the field of `` fast dynamos '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicates that in the presence of wide classes of chaotic flow fields , magnetic energy can grow very efficiently , even in the absence of rotation . in these studies ,",
    "the magnetic induction equation is solved kinematically in the presence of a prescribed flow field .",
    "if the fluid streamlines are sufficiently chaotic , the growth of magnetic energy can proceed exponentially quickly .",
    "much of the research in this area focuses on highly idealized flow fields ( e.g. @xcite ) and does not account for the role of the lorentz force in limiting the growth of the magnetic field .",
    "the major theoretical breakthrough in this area was made by @xcite , who demonstrated via a 3d mhd simulation in the boussinesq approximation that a small seed field embedded in a turbulently convecting , highly conducting plasma can indeed grow exponentially until the magnetic energy reaches a level of @xmath8@xmath9% of the kinetic energy of the convective motions .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite has shown how variation of boundary conditions and fluid mechanics parameters affect the development of the dynamo , while @xcite have focused on computing observational diagnostics of the small - scale disordered field .",
    "turbulent convective dynamo models of this type must not be confused with global - scale dynamo models driven by kinetic helicity in small - scale turbulent motions , which require rotation to generate an @xmath1 effect .",
    "an example of such a model is that of @xcite , who used an @xmath10 model to understand magnetic field generation in rotating , fully - convective naked t - tauri stars , which are believed to have little or no differential rotation @xcite .",
    "the idea is that helical turbulence driven by coriolis forces can impart a systematic twist to field lines encountering the convective eddies , leading eventually to a large - scale steady magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , the turbulent dynamo that we believe to be responsible for the small - scale disordered field in the quiet sun is unaffected by rotation , since the convective turnover time in the topmost layers of the solar convection zone is far smaller than the solar rotation period .    the growing evidence for the importance of small - scale magnetic fields in stellar atmospheres and the observational evidence for a limit to the x - ray emission in stellar coronae leads to the question : is the turbulent convective dynamo a viable mechanism to generate enough x - ray flux to account for the observational limit ?",
    "to address this question , in ",
    "[ sec : description ] we extend the investigation of field generation by a turbulent dynamo beyond the boussinesq approximation into the `` anelastic '' regime @xcite  an approximation to the 3d mhd equations that allows for gravitational stratification while still filtering out acoustic waves . here",
    ", we describe the numerical model and present a detailed analysis of our dynamo simulations . in   [",
    "sec : connect ] , we describe our method of utilizing the simulation results to predict the level of x - ray emission in main sequence stars , in   [ sec : results ] we present our results , and finally in   [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our results and summarize our findings .",
    "we solve the 3d system of mhd equations in the anelastic limit ( see @xcite and references therein for a description of the anelastic formalism and a discussion of the techniques employed to numerically solve the anelastic system ) .",
    "briefly , the anelastic approximation results from a scaled variable expansion of the fully - compressible mhd equations . density fluctuations in the continuity equation are of high order in the expansion and are neglected  this effectively filters out rapidly propagating acoustic waves , and provides a significant computational savings .",
    "the density fluctuations are retained , however , in the buoyancy force term of the momentum equation , which allows for stratification within the computational domain .",
    "thus , the anelastic formulation is an intermediary approximation between a fully - compressible treatment ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and a boussinesq model ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this treatment is well - suited for describing the high-@xmath11 plasma of stellar interiors , but can not directly model surface plasmas where @xmath12 and the acoustic mach number becomes large .",
    "in particular , we solve a non - dimensional form of the anelastic mhd equations in a horizontally periodic , vertically closed cartesian domain .",
    "our non - rotating rectangular box spans five pressure scale heights vertically , which corresponds to a density difference of @xmath13 between the upper and lower boundaries .",
    "the resolution of the cartesian domain is @xmath14 , which gives an aspect ratio for the box of @xmath15 .",
    "the non - dimensional parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the reynolds number and prandtl number , respectively ) are defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and are set to @xmath20 and unity respectively ( the reynolds number was chosen to be as large as possible without introducing numerical artifacts ) . here",
    ", @xmath21 denotes the pressure scale height at the base of the domain , @xmath22 refers to the coefficient of thermal conductivity , and @xmath23 is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity ( assumed constant ) . the convective velocity is measured in units of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the non - dimensional super - adiabaticity , and @xmath27 is the constant vertical gravitational acceleration .",
    "we begin by dynamically and thermally relaxing a purely hydrodynamic model convection zone .",
    "we initiate convection by introducing a small random entropy perturbation within a computational domain with a prescribed background entropy gradient ( see @xcite ) , and allow the simulation to progress past the time when the convective velocity field attains a statistically steady state .",
    "we then set the magnetic reynolds number @xmath28 of the simulation to @xmath29 , and introduce a small , dynamically unimportant magnetic seed field ( after @xmath30 of the field - free relaxation run ) .",
    "the seed field self - consistently grows and evolves within the computational domain as the run progresses ( see figures  [ fig : log_energy_relaxation ] and [ fig : energy_relaxation ] ) .",
    "the vertical boundary conditions on the magnetic field are stress - free and non - penetrating at the bottom , and the field at the upper boundary is assumed potential .",
    "we note that unlike the simulations of @xcite , our potential field upper boundary condition does allow for a small amount of horizontally - directed signed magnetic flux to diffuse out of the domain .",
    "also note that our `` global '' diffusion timescale of @xmath31  the characteristic time over which a magnetic structure diffuses across @xmath21 ( as specified by our choice of magnetic reynolds number )  greatly exceeds the characteristic convective timescale of the simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : log_energy_relaxation ] shows the temporal evolution of the total kinetic ( @xmath32 ) , thermal ( @xmath33 ) , and magnetic ( @xmath34 ) energy fluctuations ( each integrated over the entire domain ) .",
    "the quantities are normalized by the sum of the three ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we find that the energy of the seed field ( initially at @xmath36 of the total kinetic energy ) increases exponentially with a growth time of @xmath37 until the magnetic field becomes dynamically important ( @xmath38 ) , after which the increase becomes approximately linear in time .",
    "the magnetic energy fully saturates to a time - averaged value of @xmath39% of the total kinetic energy after @xmath40 , and ranges from @xmath41@xmath42% of @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy_relaxation ] shows the energies on a linear scale  as the magnetic energy increases , the kinetic energy decreases , and the thermal energy fluctuations of the plasma increase .",
    "figure  [ fig : volume ] is a volume rendering of both the entropy perturbations ( bottom frame ) and magnetic field strength @xmath43 well after the field has saturated ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is evident that strong magnetic fields are concentrated in the narrow , low - entropy vortical downdrafts characteristic of stratified convection ( particularly in the upper half of the box ) , and that a greater proportion of the total unsigned magnetic flux resides in the lower half of the box .",
    "the net signed flux in our dynamo simulations is always zero , and unless otherwise stated , all magnetic fluxes discussed hereafter refer to unsigned magnetic fluxes .",
    "we note that even though our simulations exhibit the vertical flow asymmetries typical of stratified convection , and even though we use different values of dimensionless fluid parameters and do not achieve the highest numerical resolutions explored by @xcite , we still find similar and significant levels magnetic energy relative to kinetic energy over the simulation domain .",
    "figure  [ fig : mgrams ] shows a `` magnetogram '' of the vertical component of the field near the top of the simulation box ( left panel ) and near the base of the box ( right panel ) .    to quantify the distribution of unsigned magnetic flux in the domain ( after the dynamo has fully saturated ) , we define a magnetic filling factor @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 refer to the horizontal extent of the cartesian domain , and the quantity @xmath48 is defined as unity if @xmath49 and zero otherwise ( @xmath50 is a chosen threshold value ) . if we adopt a threshold value of @xmath51 , we find that along horizontal slices near the top and bottom of the domain  @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively  the time average of the filling factor @xmath54 varies little , and is quite small : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this indicates that strong fields are concentrated and highly localized . here",
    ", @xmath57 refers to the maximum value of @xmath58 at @xmath59 sampled every @xmath60 in the time interval between @xmath61@xmath62 . if we choose a cutoff of @xmath63 we find a much larger disparity for the same horizontal planes : @xmath64 near the surface , and @xmath65 near the bottom .",
    "this suggests that the weaker field is more evenly distributed , particularly in the lower half of the domain .",
    "figure  [ fig : filling_factors ] shows the time averaged filling factor as a function of @xmath66 along both slices .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines denote the horizontal planes near the surface and closer to the lower boundary respectively ( these planes are the same as those shown in figure  [ fig : mgrams ] ) . the solid line denotes the time averaged volumetric filling factor ( the volumetric analogue to the area filling factor with @xmath57 defined as the maximum value of @xmath67 in the volume ) .",
    "a topic of great current interest is the dependence of dynamo behavior on the magnetic prandtl number @xmath68 , which is the ratio of kinematic viscosity to magnetic diffusivity , ( or the ratio of the magnetic reynolds number to the viscous reynolds number , @xmath69 ) . considering only the processes of coulomb collisions in a fully ionized upper stellar convection zone",
    ", one can show @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the temperature in k , and @xmath72 is the number density of hydrogen atoms in @xmath73 . substituting typical values for @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ", one finds @xmath74 .",
    "while a complete investigation of the dependence of our own convective dynamo on @xmath68 is beyond the scope of this paper , as the simulation described above took 56 cpu months of computing resources , we have performed several exploratory calculations to get a rough idea of how the convective dynamo effectiveness depends on @xmath68 .",
    "first , we have used the initial convective state of the dynamo run of this paper to explore how @xmath68 affects the early growth phase of our convective dynamo .",
    "the result is that the growth rate decreases rapidly for @xmath75 , but shows signs of saturation for @xmath76 .",
    "second , we have used the saturated dynamo state of this paper as the initial condition for a series of simulations in which the same viscous reynolds number is used , but where the magnetic reynolds number has been changed , resulting in differing values of @xmath68 .",
    "the convective dynamo then begins to relax to a new state that reflects the changed value of @xmath68 .",
    "it appears that both the magnetic energy and the unsigned magnetic flux drop significantly for @xmath75 , but shows signs of saturation for @xmath76 .",
    "beyond this , for a fixed value of @xmath68 , we also find evidence for a dependence on the magnetic or viscous reynolds number due to the fact that we can not simulate the full inertial range .",
    "we expect , as per the discussion below , that there will be an asymptotic limit to the kinetic and magnetic energies as the reynolds numbers increase .    from this behavior",
    ", we conclude that for values of @xmath68 much smaller than @xmath77 ( for the range of magnetic and viscous reynolds numbers that we can simulate ) , the convective dynamo is ineffective at generating magnetic energies that approach those of the kinetic energy of convection . we also conclude that values of @xmath78 can generate significant amounts of magnetic energy and flux , with levels that are within a factor of @xmath79 of equipartition with kinetic energy . we speculate that larger values of @xmath68 may to some degree increase the effectiveness of the dynamo beyond the cases we can investigate here , but it seems unlikely that the dynamo can generate more magnetic energy than the kinetic energy equipartition value .",
    "further , the simulations of @xcite , in which a closed magnetic ring is stretched by random convective motions , essentially has @xmath80 since the magnetic resistivity is zero in calculations like these . yet these simulations still attain a finite amount of magnetic energy . in the large @xmath68 limit ,",
    "the field strength is most likely determined by a dynamic force balance between ram pressure gradients and magnetic tension forces , rather than by a balance between field amplification via stretching and field decay by magnetic diffusion , as occurs in the kinematic limit in many dynamo simulations .",
    "given the dependence of the convective dynamo on @xmath68 that we seem to find , the small value of @xmath68 set by collisional processes in stellar convections zones suggests that convective dynamos are extremely inefficient .",
    "however , a number of observational and theoretical considerations suggest the appropriate value for @xmath68 is in fact much closer to unity in real stellar convection zones .",
    "we discuss these here .",
    "first , magnetic elements on the sun are observed to move , disperse , and cancel in response to granular and supergranular motions @xcite , indicating that long before the tiny molecular dissipation scales are reached , motions associated with convection can effectively disperse a magnetic element on much larger size scales .",
    "this means that the effective magnetic diffusivity is much larger than the molecular value .",
    "a similar argument applied to the observed correlation length and correlation time of convective motions also leads to a kinematic viscosity much greater than the molecular value , and qualitatively close to the effective magnetic diffusivity  implying a value of @xmath68 near unity .",
    "a related theoretical argument for @xmath81 comes from two observations of our own simulations : ( 1 ) both the magnetic and viscous reynolds numbers of the real physical system we are attempting to model are far greater than those in our code .",
    "therefore , at the smallest scale we can resolve in our code , magnetic fields and momentum are still well within the inertial range of the turbulent motions excited by convection , and therefore both momentum and magnetic fields will be diffused by eddies at the resolution scale and smaller . applying a common eddy diffusivity for both quantities leads to a value of @xmath81 . a pitfall to this argument",
    "would occur if one could show that what occurred on sub - resolution scales could strongly affect what happens on the largest scales .",
    "this leads to our second observation : ( 2 ) both the magnetic and kinetic energy spectra exhibit peaks at large scales , with significantly reduced energy at the smallest scales in the simulation , especially near the bottom of the simulation where the magnetic energy density is highest .",
    "given this , it seems unlikely that details of the dissipation physics occurring on unresolved scales will have a strong effect on the macroscopic properties of the dynamo simulation we have computed using @xmath82 .",
    "it is interesting to note that our conclusion that both magnetic and kinetic energies peak at large scales differs from the results of dynamo calculations using the `` kazantsev '' approach , in which either the velocity ( in kinematic models , e.g. @xcite ) or an external force field ( in dynamic models , e.g. @xcite ) are driven by an assumed temporal white noise spectrum . because our driving motions are computed self - consistently from the convection itself , and not from ad - hoc assumptions about a forcing term , we feel we have applied our results in a physically self - consistent manner by assuming a value of @xmath68 near unity",
    ".    there are other theoretical arguments against using the molecular diffusivities .",
    "@xcite argue that the presence of fibril magnetic fields in the convection zone plasma results in an effective viscosity that is at least as great as the turbulent viscosity , if not larger .",
    "@xcite show that magnetic flux tubes are dispersed in a model convection zone with an effective magnetic diffusivity given by a turbulent eddy diffusivity .    taken together ,",
    "all of these results argue for a common eddy diffusivity for both processes and therefore a magnetic prandtl number near unity .",
    "we adopt @xmath82 instead of unity simply because we want to choose the largest possible values of the viscous and magnetic reynolds numbers that do not result in numerical artifacts .",
    "our preliminary calculations indicate no significant differences between using results from @xmath82 versus assuming a value of unity .",
    "here , we relate the anelastic simulation results described in  [ sec : description ] , which are performed in dimensionless units , to physical units so that the resulting magnetic surface flux can be compared with stellar observations .",
    "we must therefore assign cgs units to the non - dimensional simulation results and connect the velocity and magnetic fields of the simulation to the luminosity , surface gravity , radius , effective temperature and surface density of main sequence reference stars .",
    "the variation of the background temperature @xmath83 and density @xmath84 with height @xmath85 above the base of our anelastic simulation box is taken to be a polytrope with index @xmath86 ( here @xmath87 refers to the adiabatic index for an ideal gas ) and is given explicitly by @xmath88    \\label{eq : tzero}\\ ] ] and @xmath89 here , the subscript `` ref '' denotes chosen reference values at the base of the box ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the reference temperature @xmath96 at the base is determined from the effective surface temperature @xmath97 by setting @xmath98 , and then using the fixed ratio @xmath90 to determine the actual value of @xmath96 in degrees k. similarly , the value of surface density from stellar atmosphere models , along with equation [ eq : rhozero ] is used to determine the reference density @xmath99 .    in the anelastic simulation ,",

    "our neglect of the effects of variable ionization in the background atmosphere is a limitation of our current calculations that could be improved in future work .",
    "we assume that the values of @xmath103 and @xmath105 , the surface gravitational acceleration , are equal , since the depth of the box is quite small compared to a stellar radius for the cases we consider .",

    "the unit of velocity in the simulations is defined in terms of a dimensionless entropy gradient ( see   [ sec : description ] ) . to convert the velocity units to physical values",
    ", we note that in our simulation , the dominant form of energy transport from the base to the top is thermal convection .",
    "we therefore require that the vertical energy flux match that needed to carry the stellar luminosity in a particular stellar model .",
    "in other words , for a given star with luminosity @xmath108 and radius @xmath109 , the energy flux carried by convection in the outer convective envelope must be given by @xmath110 we have assumed that throughout the convective envelope , the fraction of energy carried by radiative diffusion is far less than that carried by convection , which is a reasonable assumption for the stars we consider here .",
    "this assumption will break down near the photosphere , where radiation begins to dominate .    to estimate @xmath111 in a consistent way that applies to each of the different stellar types we consider , we use a simple form of mixing length theory to obtain an approximate reference value of the convective velocity at the depth corresponding to the base of our simulation domain . here",

    "we are justified in ignoring the change in radius with depth and assume that @xmath111 is uniform with depth within the box .",
    "this means that @xmath24 at the base of the box ( i.e. , @xmath118 ) can be found from equations [ eq : tzero ] , [ eq : rhozero ] , [ eq : fconv ] , and [ eq : mlt ] , and is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 note that equation [ eq : vr ] is extremely insensitive to the precise formulation used in the mixing length theory . for example , if the coefficient `` @xmath8 '' in equation [ eq : mlt ] was changed by a factor of ten , it would result in only a factor of @xmath123 difference in the resulting value of @xmath118 .",

    "we note that although the anelastic formulation is not well suited to modeling the surface layers of stellar atmospheres , and that the convection in our simulations is not driven explicitly by radiative cooling in the surface layers , our simulation remains appropriate for our study since we are only interested in obtaining an estimate of the total magnetic flux threading the top of the convective envelope  not the detailed dynamics or distribution of magnetic fields across a stellar photosphere .",

    "strong fields are concentrated and highly localized , while weaker fields are more evenly distributed .",

    "the magnetic fluxes were obtained by first averaging the total unsigned flux through a horizontal layer near the top of the simulation box ( @xmath133 ) over an interval @xmath134 centered at @xmath135 ( see figure  [ fig : log_energy_relaxation ] ) .",
    "the simulated result was then scaled from the horizontal area of the computational domain to the surface area of the reference stars . here",

    "we binned the stellar data for the @xmath142 pc sample into spectral type bins ( m0 , m0.5 , m1 , m1.5 ,  ) and averaged the values of @xmath140 and @xmath141 in each bin .",
    "these averages were then fit with a 5th - order polynomial to construct our final m dwarf calibration of @xmath140 and @xmath141 as a function of spectral type . using the published x - ray luminosities and our calculated stellar radii , we then found the x - ray surface flux for each observed star ( shown as a filled circle in figure  [ fig : xrayflux ] ) .",
    "our predicted model surface fluxes calculated using a mixing length parameter @xmath130 are shown with asterisks connected by a dashed line in the same figure .",
    "the gray region shows the range of the predicted surface x - ray fluxes if the convective flux calculated by the models varies by a factor of eight ( or equivalently if the velocity scaling varies by a factor of two ) above or below that calculated using @xmath130 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the heating mechanism that produces x - ray emission also produces emission in chromospheric and transition region diagnostics , contributing to the basal emission level observed in these lines . without a detailed magnetic heating model , we can only explore this issue using flux - flux relationships between x - ray emission and diagnostics such as emission .",
    "many investigators have found good correlation between these diagnostics , and here we use the flux - flux relationship @xmath143 based on table 4 of @xcite to determine an estimate of emission for our reference stars .",
    "@xcite do not find a basal emission level in their x - ray observations , but do find one in the emission which they attribute to acoustic heating . subtracting off this basal emission from observed emission for all stars then improves the correlation of with x - ray emission .",
    "the assumption is that this excess emission is all magnetic in origin , as is the x - ray emission .",
    "since the emission we calculate is explicitly magnetic in origin , we use the relationship between excess emission and x - ray emission ( column b of table 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "we note though , that using the total flux - flux relationship given in @xcite increases the predicted emission by only @xmath144 dex , which is well within the range of variation shown in the plots for different choices of the mixing length in our magnetoconvection simulations .",
    "since our predicted x - ray surface fluxes do not depend strongly on stellar @xmath141 , it is not surprising that we find a similarly weak dependence on stellar spectral type of the resulting surface flux : we find @xmath145 at f0 and @xmath146 at m0 .    at first glance",
    ", these values appear inconsistent with the basal flux observations of @xcite ( their figure 1b ) , where the basal level appears to be @xmath147 at @xmath148 .",
    "however , a closer inspection of this figure ( indeed , of all the flux - color figures in @xcite ) shows that the lower limit to the emission is defined by giants and subgiants at later spectral types .",
    "the dwarf stars are all significantly stronger than the apparent lower limit at these later spectral types . in addition",
    ", there is no apparent piling up of the dwarf star observations against a lower bound as would be expected for basal emission ( see @xcite ) , probably due in part to the small number of dwarf stars observed by @xcite ( there are only 13 stars later than @xmath149 in their figure 1b ) .",
    "this lack of piling up of the dwarfs is apparent across all @xmath141 ( 0.3 to 1.5 ) plotted in @xcite . a more complete survey of emission in k and m dwarf stars is provided by @xcite . in figure  [ fig : mg2flux ] we plot the surface flux on the dk and dm stars from tables 1 and 2 of @xcite against their observed @xmath141 ( we do not plot the dke and dme stars as these stars are expected to  and do ",
    "show much stronger emission than that from basal emission stars ) .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : mg2flux ] is our predicted surface flux based on our dwarf models from equation  [ eq : fluxflux ] .",
    "our predicted emission levels due to a convective dynamo fall nicely at the lower limit of the observed emission in the range that the models are valid ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the agreement seen in figure  [ fig : mg2flux ] is substantially better than that shown in the acoustic heating models of @xcite , whose predicted surface fluxes are too weak ( @xmath151 to @xmath152 at @xmath153 ) and show a much stronger color dependence ( for @xmath154 ) than seen in the dwarf star observations of @xcite or seen in the dwarf star observations of @xcite . on the other hand , at earlier spectra types ( @xmath155 ) the acoustic heating models better match the lower bound of the observations than the crude estimates presented here .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : description ] , the overall flux achieved in our convective dynamo simulations does depend on the value of the magnetic prandtl number @xmath68",
    ". however , the scaling of the model to main sequence stars of different spectral types does not ",
    "the resulting weak color dependence of the x - ray and emission is independent of @xmath68 , whereas acoustic heating models show a strong color dependence .",
    "the x - ray data ( figure  [ fig : xrayflux ] ) and the more complete data ( figure  [ fig : mg2flux ] ) show a weak color dependence over the spectral type range in our models that is consistent with the convective dynamo predictions and not with the acoustic model predictions .",
    "we have performed 3d mhd simulations of a turbulent dynamo in a highly stratified cartesian domain in order to determine the amount and distribution of magnetic flux generated in a non - rotating convective envelope .",
    "we use the computed surface flux near the upper boundary of the domain and an empirical relationship between magnetic flux and x - ray flux @xcite to determine the lower limit of x - ray emission in main sequence stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : xrayflux ] suggests that our simple analytic scaling treatment successfully reproduces the observed lower limit of x - ray flux found by @xcite in the range from f0m0 .",
    "this result suggests that the level of heating by magnetic sources in the coronae of these stars is sufficient to account for most if not all of the x - ray flux .",
    "stars earlier than spectral type f0 are expected to have the thicknesses of their outer convective shells rapidly decrease to zero as the surface temperature increases .",
    "the low surface x - ray fluxes for the three observed stars for which @xmath156 are consistent with less heating due to a diminished level of magnetic field generated by the convective dynamo ; however , the same argument holds for less heating due to a diminished convective acoustic flux .",
    "we do not extend our treatment to spectral types later than m0 , since we expect that our assumptions of an ideal equation of state and high electrical conductivity will break down for cool m dwarf atmospheres .",
    "our treatment implicitly assumes that the @xcite relation applies to magnetic flux generated by the turbulent convective dynamo .",
    "currently , the best hope for verifying this assumption is forward modeling of coronal heating of ensembles of magnetic loops ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as in understanding the role of sub - pixel magnetic structures on measured magnetic flux densities .",
    "we use the flux - flux relation of @xcite to determine the expected level of chromospheric emission in . for k dwarfs",
    "we find good agreement with the observed lower limit of surface flux in the k dwarf sample of @xcite , suggesting that this observed lower limit is entirely the result of magnetic heating . on the other hand , our models predict a very shallow dependence of both x - ray and emission with spectral type , so that they underestimate the emission at earlier spectral types ( though our models are a good match to the x - ray emission at these spectral types ) .",
    "this suggests some other agent ( acoustic heating ) is required to produce the minimum observed emission at earlier spectral types , and that this additional mechanism produces relatively little x - ray emission . at the very latest spectral types , the sharp drop in the surface flux seen in figure  [ fig : mg2flux ] at @xmath157 suggests something very different may be happening here .",
    "we do not expect our models to be valid at these cool temperatures due to the relatively low ionization that will result .",
    "in addition , the x - ray emission from stars observed in figure  [ fig : xrayflux ] does not show this same drop , indicating that the flux - flux calibration used to predict the emission based on the x - ray emission will not hold .",
    "we can not address the level of acoustic heating with our dynamo model .",
    "obviously , if there is convection there will be some level of acoustic activity .",
    "however , the results we present here provide a consistent and viable alternative to acoustic heating for k type dwarfs in the absence of a large scale dynamo . at earlier spectral types ,",
    "our results suggest turbulent dynamos can also fully account for the lower limit to the observed x - ray emission , though there may still be a substantial acoustic contribution to the coronal emission in earlier type stars .",
