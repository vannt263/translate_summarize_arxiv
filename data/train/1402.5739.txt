    "these @xmath0hypergraphs are a natural generalization of ( simple ) comparability graphs ( graphs which can be transitively oriented or , equivalently , graphs associated to a partially ordered set ) .",
    "comparability graphs are well known to be perfect graphs .",
    "a graph is said to be _ perfect _ if all of its induced subgraphs have chromatic number equal to their clique number .",
    "this concept was introduced by claude berge in 1961 @xcite .",
    "in essence it means that a graph is perfect if for every of its induced subgraphs the chromatic number is as low as possible in terms of its clique number .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask whether or not comparability @xmath0hypergraphs are perfect in this sense .",
    "hypergraphs have been studied in relation to perfection in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , the precise concept of perfection for hypergraphs remains imprecise , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "aiming to find a suitable definition of perfection in hypergraphs , we study the relationship between the chromatic number and the clique number of comparability @xmath0hypergraphs .",
    "we define a _ @xmath0hypergraph _ @xmath1 as usual , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the set of _ vertices _ of @xmath1 , and @xmath4@xmath5 is the set of _ edges_. the _ chromatic number _ , @xmath6 , is defined as the minimum @xmath7 , such that @xmath3 can be partitioned into @xmath7 parts , called _ color classes _ , in such a way that no edge of @xmath1 is monochromatic , in other words , no edge is contained in a single color class . the _ clique number _ , @xmath8 , of a @xmath0hypergraph @xmath1 is the largest cardinality of a subset of @xmath3 inducing a complete @xmath0hypergraph .",
    "given that for any complete @xmath0hypergraph on @xmath9 vertices,@xmath10 , we have that @xmath11 , then for any @xmath0hypergraph the following equation holds : @xmath12    in this paper we study three important subclasses of comparability @xmath0hypergraphs which show three different behaviors in relation to ( 1 ) .",
    "firstly , we exhibit a family of comparability @xmath0hypergraphs for which the difference , @xmath13 , is arbitrarily large .",
    "secondly , we exhibit an interesting subclass of comparability @xmath0hypergraphs , named cyclic permutation @xmath0hypergraphs ( the analogues of permutation graphs ) , such that their chromatic number is bounded by a ( linear ) function of its clique number .",
    "finally , we exhibit another interesting subclass of comparability @xmath0hypergraphs namely , the ones associated to a family of intervals in the circle . for these hypergraphs the chromatic number is as low as it can be in respect to their clique , that is , equality holds in ( 1 ) .",

    "recall that a circle interval @xmath0-hypergraph @xmath55 associated to a finite family @xmath287 of closed intervals in the circle , is a @xmath0hypergraph with vertex set @xmath57 and whose edges are the triplets of vertices whose corresponding intervals are pairwise disjoint . in this section",
    "we will prove theorem [ thm : main3 ] , which claims that @xmath288 .",
    "note that a sub - family of intervals @xmath289 corresponds to a clique of @xmath55 if and only if @xmath290 is a pairwise disjoint subset of intervals of @xmath56 .",
    "thus , @xmath291 is the cardinality of the largest pairwise disjoint subset of intervals in @xmath56 .",
    "* proof of theorem [ thm : main3 ] * : as we already know @xmath292 then it suffices to show that @xmath293 .",
    "we proceed by induction on the size of @xmath291 .",
    "let @xmath294 then the @xmath0-hypegraph @xmath55 has an empty set of edges , thus @xmath295 .    for the remainder of the induction argument we will deal with the odd case and the even case separately .",

    "without loss of generality , we might assume that there is no other interval of @xmath287 contained in @xmath298 for every @xmath299 .",
    "denote by @xmath300 the set of intervals of @xmath287 that intersect @xmath301 .",
    "note that , as no interval of @xmath287 is contained in @xmath301 , necessarily out of every three intervals in @xmath300 two of them intersect .",
    "thus , @xmath300 corresponds to a independent set of @xmath55 .",
    "next observe that , @xmath302 ( consisting of all intervals in @xmath54 that do not intersect @xmath301 ) , may be regarded as a set of intervals in the real line , assume with out lost of generality that they are ordered form left to right as @xmath303 .",
    "as @xmath296 , the maximum number of pairwise disjoint intervals of @xmath302 is @xmath304 . consider @xmath305 the left hand side of each of this intervals .",
    "for @xmath306 , let @xmath307 be the subset of intervals of @xmath308 that intersects @xmath309 for each @xmath310 .",
    "clearly , each @xmath307 is an independent set because it satisfies that out of every three intervals in @xmath307 , two intersect .",
    "consequently , @xmath55 contains @xmath311 independent sets and thus , @xmath312 .",
    "now assume that @xmath313 .",
    "let @xmath314 be a pairwise disjoint set of intervals .",
    "without loss of generality , suppose that the distance between @xmath315 and @xmath316 is the smallest possible between all choices of pairwise disjoint subsets of @xmath287 .",
    "this implies two facts ; firstly , that the collection , @xmath300 of intervals of @xmath287 which intersect @xmath317 satisfies that out of every three intervals in @xmath300 , two intersect , thus @xmath300 is an independent set of the hypergraph @xmath55 ; secondly that the collection of intervals @xmath302 may be regarded as a set of intervals in the real line .",
    "here we also have that the maximum number of pairwise disjoint intervals of @xmath302 is @xmath318 , and as before assume that they are ordered from left to right as @xmath319 and each one of them do not contain completely any other interval , consider @xmath320 the left hand side of each one of this intervals .",
    "let @xmath307 be the subset of intervals of @xmath302 that intersects @xmath309 for each @xmath321 .",
    "clearly , each @xmath307 is independent because it satisfies that out of every three intervals in @xmath307 , two intersect .",
    "consequently @xmath322 .",
    "this , concludes the proof of the theorem .",
    "clearly any sub - hypergraph of a circle interval @xmath0hypergraph is a circle interval @xmath0hypergraph , thus theorem [ thm : main3 ] implies that any circle interval @xmath0hypergraph , as well as all its induced sub - hypergraphs satisfy @xmath323 which , in the classic context of perfection would mean that this hypergraphs are  perfect \" .",
