    "the early attempts at observing the casimir force , initiated by sparnaay in 1958 @xcite and later by van blokland and overbeek in 1978 @xcite , were not conclusive due to large experimental uncertainty . in recent years , however , there have been a number of precision measurements which set the modern stage in this field ; starting in 1997 by lamoreaux @xcite who used a torsion pendulum with an electromechanical feedback system to measure the casimir force between a spherical surface ( lens ) and a flat plate .",
    "@xcite measured the casimir force between a sphere mounted on the tip of a flexible cantilever and a flat plate by an atomic force microscope .",
    "@xcite measured the casimir force between a sphere and a flat plate in a microelectromechanical system ( mems ) using a micromachined torsional device .",
    "all these experiments confirm the casimir force formula in the range from 100 nm to several @xmath11 m to a few per cent accuracy . in order to achieve this high precision , a careful analysis of the corrections due to the finite conductivity of the metal surfaces , roughness , and nonzero temperature , is indispensable @xcite .",
    "the above cited experiments in fact deviate from the flat plate geometry corresponding to eq.([flat ] ) by using a plane - sphere configuration ( thus avoiding the experimental difficulty of keeping two flat surfaces sufficiently parallel ) .",
    "the force for a spherical surface with ( large ) radius @xmath12 at a distance @xmath0 of closest surface - to - surface approach from a flat plate can then be calculated from the casimir potential @xmath13 for two flat plates by using the _ proximity force rule _",

    "@xcite measured the casimir force between two parallel flat surfaces directly , confirming eq.([flat ] ) to 15% accuracy .",
    "the casimir force in eq.([flat ] ) has analogies to the effective force between particles or plates immersed in a system close to its _ critical point _ , which arises due to the modification of thermal fluctuations of the bulk order parameter .",
    "this effect was originally predicted in 1978 by fisher and de gennes @xcite for colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture near its critical de - mixing point , and observed experimentally for silica spheres immersed in a mixture of water and oil ( 2,6-lutidine ) @xcite .",
    "related phenomena occur in liquid crystals @xcite , microemulsions @xcite , and for inclusions in fluctuating membranes @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for a review ) . in recent years",
    ", the critical - point casimir effect has attracted increasing theoretical @xcite and experimental interest @xcite . for he@xmath14 wetting films close to the superfluid phase transition , the theoretical predictions @xcite for critical - point casimir forces between parallel surfaces exhibiting dirichlet boundary conditions",
    "have been confirmed quantitatively @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ flat ] ) for the electromagnetic casimir force is valid in the ideal limit of perfectly conducting plates . in the more general context of the lifshitz theory for dielectric bodies",
    "@xcite , this corresponds to an infinite dielectric constant @xmath15 for all frequencies @xmath16 . for finite @xmath17 , this power law for the force is recovered for large distances @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the smallest resonance ( absorption ) frequency of the dielectric ( usually @xmath20 nm ) . in this , so - called retarded , limit , the force is _ universal _ in the sense that it only depends on the electrostatic dielectric constant @xmath21 .",
    "the opposite limit of @xmath22 gives the unretarded van der waals force @xmath23 .",
    "the interpretation of the casimir force in terms of changes in zero point vacuum electromagnetic energy suggests it to be a strong function of geometry ; probing the global shape of the boundary that confines the vacuum fluctuations @xcite . indeed , whereas the van der waals force between electrically polarizable particles is always attractive , even the _ sign _ of the casimir force is geometry dependent , and can be _ repulsive _ , e.g. , for a thin spherical or cubic conducting shell @xcite .",
    "repulsive casimir forces are expected also when _ magnetic _ properties of the boundaries are exploited , e.g. , by using a perfectly conducting and an infinitely permeable plate @xcite .",
    "apart from the importance of these phenomena to basic science , the ongoing refinement of nanofabrication technology in electronics and mechanics also provides new impetus for the understanding of such systems in view of applications in nanotechnology . on length scales of about 100 nm and below",
    ", the casimir force becomes comparable or even dominant to other forces @xcite , and thus must be taken into account in the design and operation of nanoscale devices @xcite .",
    "indeed , the experiment of chan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrates the possibility for novel actuation schemes in microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) based on the casimir force .",
    "they also show that the casimir force can be used to control _ dynamic _ properties of such systems , e.g. , in a nonlinear micromechanical casimir oscillator @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned dependence of strength and sign of the casimir force on geometry and material properties offers the opportunity to manipulate this interaction in a controlled way , e.g. , by tailoring the shape of the interacting surfaces . on the other hand , movable elements of nanoscale devices may unwantedly stick together due to the strong attractive casimir force , impeding their operation @xcite .",
    "this so - called stiction could possibly be prevented by using shapes ( e.g. , suitable modulations ) and materials of movable elements such that the casimir force between them is repulsive ( or at least reduced ) .    due to the importance of the casimir force to basic and applied science , it is highly desirable to demonstrate its strong shape dependence in a set - up that clearly shows its distinction from the usual pairwise additive interactions @xcite . in a previous letter",
    "@xcite we pointed out that a promising route to this end is via modifications of the parallel plate geometry , since measurement of the putative repulsive casimir interaction for a conducting sphere is experimentally difficult . in searching for nontrivial boundary dependences , roy and mohideen @xcite examined the force between a sphere and a sinusoidally corrugated plate with amplitude @xmath24 and wavelength @xmath25 .",
    "( this geometry was first suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) over the range of separations @xmath26 , the observed force showed clear deviations from the dependence expected on the basis of decomposing the casimir force to a sum of pairwise contributions ( in effect , an average over the variations in separations ) . this experimental result motivated our calculation of the exact casimir force in the geometry depicted in fig.[fig1 ] , without the assumption of pairwise additivity .",
    "our analytic results [ see eq.([ce+ ] ) and fig.[fig2 ] ] hold to second order in @xmath27 , and show that for fixed @xmath0 the corrections due to corrugation strongly depend on @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath28 the correction is by a factor of @xmath29 _ larger _ than in the opposite limit of @xmath30 where the assumption of pairwise additivity is asymptotically correct .",
    "however , the experiments of ref.@xcite are performed in the range of @xmath31 where the corrections to pairwise additivity may not be significant enough to account for the observed deviations .",
    "in ref.@xcite it has been suggested that these deviations are due to a _",
    "lateral _ force that tends to preferentially position the spherical afm tip on top of local maxima of the modulated surface ( leading to a smaller separation and stronger force ) .",
    "based on our results , we thus propose that the shape dependence of the casimir force can be probed more clearly by going to modulations of shorter wavelength ; a hard but achievable goal .",
    "the originally predicted casimir force between two flat metal plates ( or between a flat and a deformed plate ) is , for symmetry reasons , oriented normal to the surfaces of the plates .",
    "however , if both plates are deformed there is also a lateral casimir force , as predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite and confirmed experimentally @xcite . to date , the lateral force between two corrugated plates has been calculated explicitely only within the approximative approach of a pairwise summation of van der waals forces , see , e.g. , @xcite . here",
    "we calculate the lateral force exactly to second order in the corrugation amplitude for the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , without referring to a pairwise summation scheme . as for the normal force , our results [ cf .",
    "( [ ecc ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ] show that the lateral force strongly depends on the ratio of the corrugation length @xmath1 and mean plate separation @xmath0 .",
    "we find the pairwise summation to be a valid approximation only for sufficiently small values of @xmath32 .",
    "however , the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite is performed at a ratio @xmath33 where we do not expect significant deviations from the pairwise summation approximation .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we set up the general path integral formulation for the casimir energy of the electromagnetic gauge field . by separating into transversal electric and magnetic modes ,",
    "we reduce the problem to two decoupled problems for scalar fields which differ only in their boundary conditions . in each case",
    ", we calculate the casimir energy for general plate deformations perturbatively . in the third section",
    ", we give a brief summary of the pairwise summation approach , and the resulting casimir interaction .",
    "section four gives detailed results on both the normal and the lateral force between sinusoidally corrugated plates .",
    "we conclude by discussing the relevance of our results to experiments .",
    "details of the calculations are left to the appendices .",
    "we consider two perfectly conducting deformed plates @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) of mean separation @xmath0 , which are infinitely extended along the plane spanned by @xmath36 . assuming static and uniaxial deformations without overhangs , their profiles are described by height functions @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "the casimir energy at zero temperature corresponds to the difference of the ground state energies of the quantized electromagnetic ( em ) field for plates at distance @xmath0 and at @xmath39 , respectively . to obtain this energy ,",
    "we employ the path integral quantization method . for general deformations ,",
    "it is necessary to consider the action @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes a point of 4d spacetime , @xmath42 , and the four potential @xmath43 is subject to the boundary condition that the tangential components of the electric field vanish on the surfaces .",
    "the redundant degrees of freedom due to the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic field can be eliminated by the faddeev - popov gauge fixing procedure @xcite .",
    "however , for the uniaxial deformations under consideration here , we can develop a simpler quantization scheme , by a similar reasoning as used in the context of waveguides with constant cross - sectional shape @xcite . in this case , the transverse magnetic ( tm ) waves and transverse electric ( te ) waves ( with respect to the translational invariant @xmath44 direction ) constitute a complete set of modes to describe an arbitrary electromagnetic field between the plates @xcite . for tm waves all field components",
    "are then uniquely given by a scalar function corresponding to the electric field along the invariant direction , @xmath45 with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath46 on each surface @xmath34 .",
    "the te waves are analogously described by the scalar function @xmath47 with the neumann boundary condition @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the normal derivative of the surface @xmath34 pointing into the space between the two plates . after a wick rotation to the imaginary time variable @xmath50 , both fields @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be quantized using the euclidean action @xmath53 in the 4d euclidean space , the plates are parameterized by @xmath54 $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] , where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .    in order to obtain the ground state energy from this quantization scheme , we now consider the partition functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the scalar field euclidean action @xmath60 both with dirichlet ( d ) and neumann ( n ) boundary conditions at the surfaces . following refs .",
    "@xcite ( cf .",

    "our result shows that the pairwise summation approximation is not justified beyond @xmath231 . for @xmath29 of order one",
    ", the pairwise summation approach has already a relative error of about @xmath232 .",

    "these results are thus exact to second order in @xmath27 , and correctly take into account the many - body nature of the casimir interaction , going beyond the commonly used pairwise summation ( pws ) of van der waals forces @xcite .",
    "our results show significant deviations from pws to second order in @xmath27 .",
    "however , for finite values of @xmath146 and @xmath145 , there will be corrections at higher orders in @xmath146 and @xmath145 ; in the present experiments , the sensitive range of @xmath145 is of the order of @xmath233 @xcite , while we suggest values for @xmath146 of order one to probe the nontrivial shape dependence of the casimir force ( see below ) . at present , it is not clear how relevant the perturbative results to second ( or any finite ) order in @xmath27 are for this range of the parameters @xmath146 and @xmath145 ( cf .  the related discussion in sec.[sec4a ] ) .    to make further connection between our findings and the experimental situations , corrections due to the finite conductivity of the plates , finite temperature , and surface roughness",
    "should be taken into account as well @xcite .",
    "these corrections introduce additional length scales into the problem , which are in turn the plasma wavelength @xmath234 of the plates ( e.g. , @xmath235 for aluminum @xcite ) , the thermal wavelength @xmath236 ( @xmath237 at @xmath238 ) , and the transverse correlation length @xmath239 of the roughness ( usually @xmath240 @xcite ) .",
    "while the effect of finite conductivity becomes important for @xmath241 , finite temperature starts to affect the result when @xmath242 .",

    "the relative corrections @xmath245 to the casimir energy due to roughness of amplitude @xmath27 and transverse correlation length @xmath239 should be of the form ( to second order in @xmath27 ) @xmath246 for @xmath247 , and @xmath248 for @xmath249 .",
    "the latter behavior is in accordance with ref .",
    "the experimental case corresponds to neither extreme , making a more complete analysis necessary .",
    "given the above mentioned limitations , as well as the technical difficulties in achieving the desirable geometries in experiments , it seems that it is difficult to conclusively establish the nontrivial boundary dependence of the casimir force .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows that in the experiment of roy and mohideen @xcite , the lengths @xmath27 and @xmath1 are such that the nontrivial dependence of the casimir force on the boundary shape is rather weak within the monitored range of @xmath175 , and a pairwise summation of two body forces is a possibly adequate approximation .",
    "our results suggest that a set - up with @xmath1 of the order of @xmath27 is better suited for observing the nontrivial geometry dependence predicted above .    in general",
    ", one expects that as long as the nontrivial features in the geometry of the plates appear only as small perturbations to the trivial flat - plate geometry , the corresponding many - body effects of these features will be hard to measure .",
    "considerably larger effects could result , however , in patterned surfaces with geometrical features that come close together across various parts of the surfaces .",
    "in such circumstances a non - perturbative calculation of the forces becomes necessary .",
    "indeed it is most desirable to find robust numerical schemes ( possibly along the lines of ref.@xcite ) that can also incorporate the finite conductivity effects and surface roughness typical for experimental set - ups .",
    "finally , we note that in the set - up of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , nontrivial shape dependencies appear as corrections to a larger casimir force . for the purpose of experimental tests , it is much more desirable to devise set - ups which directly probe differences , without the need for subtracting a larger baseline force .",
    "for example , in an atomic force experiment , simultaneous scanning of a flat and corrugated substrate would be desirable ; while in the torsion pendulum experiment , one can imagine suspending a spherical lens equidistantly from two plates , one of which is corrugated .",
