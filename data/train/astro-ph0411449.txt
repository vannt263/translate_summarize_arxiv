    "young stellar clusters embedded within molecular clouds are valuable laboratories for studying the birth of stars , brown dwarfs , and planets @xcite . because of its rich and compact nature ( @xmath7  members , @xmath8 ) and its proximity to the sun ( @xmath9  pc ) , the ic  348 cluster in the perseus molecular cloud is a particularly appealing population . over the last decade ,",
    "the identification and characterization of the contents of young clusters like ic  348 have benefited from advancements in detectors , instruments , and telescopes .",
    "the area and sensitivity of near - infrared ( ir ) imaging surveys of ic  348 have progressively increased @xcite , resulting in improved constraints on the mass distribution of cluster members derived from statistical analysis of luminosity functions . a similar trend in optical ccd imaging of ic  348",
    "has extended the identification of individual candidate members to lower masses , higher reddenings , and larger distances from the cluster center @xcite . to assess membership and measure spectral types for these candidates ,",
    "increasingly sophisticated spectrometers have been employed , consisting of optical @xcite and near - ir @xcite single - slit instruments and optical multi - slit devices @xcite .    because of their small angular sizes and the fact that their obscured members are brightest beyond 1  , embedded clusters are well - suited for multi - object spectroscopy at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "one of the first instruments of this kind is the florida multi - object imaging near - ir grism observational spectrometer ( flamingos , @xcite ) , which we have recently used to expand our spectroscopic work in ic  348 , particularly among the members at low masses and high reddenings that are difficult to reach with optical spectroscopy . in this paper , we describe the selection of our spectroscopic targets and the flamingos observations (   [ sec : obs ] ) , measure the spectral types of the targets (   [ sec : spt ] ) , assess their membership in ic  348 (   [ sec : mem ] ) , estimate the extinctions , effective temperatures , and bolometric luminosities for 14 confirmed members and 2 late - type candidate members and interpret their positions on the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram with theoretical evolutionary models (   [ sec : hr ] ) , and discuss the implications of this work (   [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "for the flamingos spectroscopy in this study , we selected candidate members of ic  348 appearing in the optical and ir color - magnitude diagrams from @xcite .",
    "we also included known cluster members that have optical spectral types from @xcite and @xcite , which will be used as the standards during the classification of the candidates in ",
    "[ sec : spt ] . after designing a slit mask for a set of these objects",
    ", we included additional slitlets as space allowed for faint ir sources from the images of @xcite . in this way",
    ", useful spectra were obtained for 19 known members and 66 previously unclassified sources .",
    "the spectrograph was operated with the 4  m telescope at kitt peak national observatory on the nights of 2003 january 15 - 17 and december 10 and 13 .",
    "spectra were obtained through a different slit mask on each of the five nights . for each mask ,",
    "the number of exposures , integration time per exposure , and targets are listed in table  [ tab : log ] .",
    "the instrument employed a @xmath10 hgcdte hawaii-2 array , which yielded a plate scale of @xmath11 pixel@xmath12 and a field of view of a @xmath13 on the 4  m telescope .",
    "the width of each mask slitlet was @xmath14 ( 3 pixels ) .",
    "this configuration produced full coverage from 1.1 to 1.8  with a spectral resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "the targets were dithered between two positions separated by @xmath16 along the slitlets .",
    "a nearby g dwarf was also observed through a long slit for the correction of telluric absorption .",
    "after dark subtraction and flat - fielding , adjacent images along the slit were subtracted from each other to remove sky emission .",
    "the sky - subtracted images were aligned and combined .",
    "a spectrum of each target was then extracted , wavelength calibrated with oh airglow lines , and divided by the spectrum of the telluric standard . the intrinsic spectral slope and absorption features of the standard were removed by multiplying by the solar spectrum .",
    "to measure spectral types for the candidate members of ic  348 that we have observed spectroscopically , we begin by examining the spectra of the known members with optical classifications in our sample .",
    "these members consist of sources 12a ( a3 ) , 6 ( g3 ) , 59 ( k2 ) , 120 ( m2.25 ) , 122 ( m2.25 ) , 207 ( m3.5 ) , 210 ( m3.5 ) , 76 ( m3.75 ) , 95 ( m4 ) , 266 ( m4.75 ) , 112 ( m4.75 ) , 230 ( m5.25 ) , 555 ( m5.75 ) , 298 ( m6 ) , 329 ( m7.5 ) , 405 ( m8 ) , 611 ( m8 ) , 613 ( m8.25 ) , and 603 ( m8.5 ) , where the identifications and spectral types are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectra for the known members are shown in order of optical type in figures  [ fig : spec1 ] and [ fig : spec2 ] and are labeled with only their optical classifications . because the telluric correction was not always accurate between 1.345 and 1.495  , data in this wavelength range",
    "is omitted .",
    "the strongest atomic and molecular features in these spectra are labeled , which consist of the h  i and mg  i lines and the steam bands .",
    "other weaker lines are detected as well , identifications for which can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . as demonstrated in figures  [ fig : spec1 ] and [ fig : spec2 ] , the detected ir spectral features change monotonically with optical type and thus can be used to classify the new candidates observed in this work .",
    "the steam bands are particularly useful for measuring spectral types of late - type objects @xcite , as shown by the rapid change in the decrement at 1.35  and in the broad absorption at both ends of the @xmath2-band . because of the broad nature of these bands",
    ", they can be measured at low spectral resolution . meanwhile ,",
    "the narrow atomic lines become weak and difficult to detect at late m types , and thus higher resolution becomes unnecessary . therefore , the signal - to - noise of the coolest and faintest objects can be improved by smoothing to a lower resolution without compromising the spectral diagnostics .",
    "the spectra for objects later than m6 are smoothed to a resolution of @xmath17 in figure [ fig : spec2 ] , while the earlier objects in figures  [ fig : spec1 ] are shown at a resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "because near - ir steam absorption bands are stronger in young objects than in field dwarfs at a given optical spectral type @xcite , spectral types of young objects derived from steam with dwarf standards will be systematically too late . instead , to arrive at accurate spectral types , optically - classified young objects rather than dwarfs should be used when measuring spectral types of young sources from steam @xcite , which is the approach we adopt in the following classification of the candidate members of ic  348 .",
    "extinction within the natal cloud of ic  348 results in large variations in the slopes of the observed spectra in our sample . to facilitate the comparison of the steam band depths between the candidates and the optically - classified known members",
    ", we have dereddened all spectra with detectable steam to the same slope as measured by the ratios of fluxes at 1.32 and 1.68  .",
    "these dereddened spectra are not meant to be precise estimates of the intrinsic , unreddened appearance of these stars since the slopes likely vary with spectral type .",
    "after dereddening , for each candidate we measured a spectral type by visually comparing the steam bands and atomic lines in its spectrum to those in the data of the optically - classified members . through this analysis",
    ", we find that 16 of the 66 new objects in our sample exhibit m types . within the sequence of optically - classified members in figures  [ fig : spec1 ] and [ fig : spec2 ] ,",
    "these 16 sources have been inserted and are labeled with their identifications and the types derived from these ir spectra .",
    "these objects are also listed table  [ tab : mem ] .",
    "the other 50 sources lack steam absorption and therefore are earlier than @xmath19m0 .",
    "more accurate classifications for these early - type stars are not possible in most cases because the signal - to - noise is too low to measure the atomic lines .",
    "however , the spectral type constraints are sufficient to indicate that all of these 50 objects without steam are probably field stars (   [ sec : mem ] ) .",
    "these stars are listed in table  [ tab : field ] .",
    "a few of the new m - type objects require additional comments .",
    "continuum emission from cool circumstellar material should be much weaker than photospheric emission in bands as short as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , particularly given that a small fraction of members of ic  348 have noticeable excess emission at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "however , for two of the new sources , 202 and 272 , the @xmath2-band atomic lines are weaker than expected for the spectral type implied by the steam bands , which is suggestive of modest continuum veiling .",
    "the presence of veiling is not surprising given the strong h emission in both stars , which is a signature of active accretion , and the large @xmath20-band excess in source 202 . because of this possible veiling , the uncertainties in the derived spectral types for these stars are larger than for the other new m - type objects . finally , the steam absorption bands in sources 1050 and 2103 are stronger than in the latest optically - classified member in our spectroscopic sample ( m8.5 )",
    "therefore , we can place only upper limits on the spectral types of these two objects .",
    "a star projected against ic  348 could be a member of the cluster or a field star in the foreground or the background . for each of the 66 previously unclassified sources in our spectroscopic sample ,",
    "we employ the diagnostics described by @xcite to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "objects that appear near or below the main sequence when placed on the h - r diagram at the distance of ic  348 are likely to be background field stars . in the previous section ,",
    "50 stars were found to lack steam absorption , which implied spectral types earlier than m0 .",
    "some of these stars have even earlier limits based on the presence of hydrogen absorption lines .",
    "these spectral type constraints indicate that all of these stars are likely to be background field stars because of their low positions on the h - r diagram .",
    "in other words , given their faint magnitudes , these sources should be much cooler than observed if they were members of ic  348 .",
    "as noted in previous studies of ic  348 and other young clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , young stars that are seen in scattered light can appear low on the h - r diagram , even below the main sequence .",
    "indeed , a few of the previously known members of ic  348 are subluminous in this manner . as a result , it is possible that some of the objects that we classify as background stars in table  [ tab : field ] could be scattered - light members of ic  348 .",
    "imaging of ic  348 with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ should easily identify any young objects of this kind through detections of their mid - ir excesses .",
    "we now evaluate the membership of the remaining objects , which are the 16 m - type sources . because ic  348 is a star - forming cluster , signatures of youth comprise evidence of membership .",
    "examples include emission in the brackett and paschen series of hydrogen and excess emission at @xmath20 , which are found in three of our sources .",
    "next , the presence of significant reddening in the spectrum or colors ( @xmath21 ) of a star and a position above the main sequence for the distance of ic  348 indicate that it can not be a dwarf in the foreground or the background of the cluster , respectively .",
    "fourteen of the new m - type objects are not field dwarfs when this criterion is applied with the extinctions estimated in the next section .",
    "the remaining two m - type sources , the ones classified as @xmath5m8.5 , also appear to exhibit reddening in their spectra and colors",
    ". however , the reddenings implied by the spectra are uncertain because of the low signal - to - noise of those data while the reddenings measured from near - ir colors are uncertain because the spectral type , and thus the adopted intrinsic colors , are not well constrained .",
    "therefore , with this diagnostic , we can not rule out the possibility that these two sources are foreground dwarfs .",
    "pre - main - sequence objects can also be distinguished from field dwarfs and giants with spectral features that are sensitive to surface gravity , a variety of which have been identified for cool objects at both optical @xcite and near - ir @xcite wavelengths .",
    "for instance , the broad plateaus observed in the @xmath2 and @xmath20 spectra of late - m and l dwarfs @xcite are absent in data for young objects , resulting in sharply peaked , triangular continua @xcite , as illustrated by the known late - type members of ic  348 in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] .",
    "the @xmath2-band spectra of the new m - type sources appear to exhibit this signature of youth , but we do not consider this definitive evidence of membership since we do not have spectra of field dwarfs and giants to compare to these sources .",
    "the results of our analysis of the membership of the 16 new m - type sources are compiled in table  [ tab : mem ] . in summary ,",
    "we have found evidence of membership in ic  348 for 14 of the 16 new m - type sources .",
    "the remaining two objects are promising candidate members that require additional data to determine their membership definitively .",
    "the masses and reddenings of these 16 sources relative to those of the previously known members of ic  348 are illustrated by the diagram of @xmath22 versus @xmath2 in figure  [ fig : jh ] .      in this section",
    ", we estimate effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities for the 14 new members of ic  348 , place these data on the h - r diagram , and use theoretical evolutionary models to infer masses and ages .",
    "we also estimate the values of these properties expected for the two late - m candidate members , 1050 and 2103 , if they are bonafide members .    for each source",
    ", we adopt the average extinction measured from its @xmath23 and @xmath22 colors .",
    "the extinction from @xmath23 is computed in the manner described by @xcite . for @xmath22 ,",
    "we compute extinction from the color excess relative to dwarf colors at the spectral type in question , with the exception of sources 202 and 1124 .",
    "because these stars exhibit large @xmath20-band excesses , their @xmath22 and @xmath24 colors are instead dereddened to the locus observed for classical t  tauri stars @xcite .",
    "spectral types are converted to temperatures with the temperature scale from @xcite .",
    "bolometric luminosities are estimated by combining @xmath1-band measurements , a distance modulus of 7.5 , and bolometric corrections described by @xcite .",
    "the estimates of extinctions , temperatures , and luminosities for the 16 m - type sources are listed in table  [ tab : mem ] .",
    "these temperatures and luminosities can be interpreted in terms of masses and ages with theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "we select the models of @xcite and @xcite because they provide the best agreement with observational constraints @xcite .",
    "the 14 new members of ic  348 and the two candidate members are plotted with these models on the h - r diagram in figure  [ fig : hr ] . for comparison",
    ", we also include the sequence of previously known members from @xcite , which encompasses the positions of the new sources .",
    "the 14 new members at m2-m6 exhibit masses of 0.45 to 0.08  @xmath25 according to the adopted models . meanwhile , if the two late - type candidates are cluster members , then they should have masses less than 0.04  @xmath25 .",
    "adopting the median cluster age of @xmath26  myr implies masses of only @xmath27  @xmath25 for these two sources .",
    "we have demonstrated that multi - object spectroscopy at near - ir wavelengths can be successfully used to efficiently obtain accurate spectral classifications ( @xmath280.5 - 1  subclasss at m types ) for large numbers of faint candidate young stars and brown dwarfs in embedded clusters .",
    "our flamingos spectroscopy of 66 ir sources toward ic  348 has resulted in the discovery of 14 new members , several of which are highly reddened and inaccessible at optical wavelengths .",
    "these sources exhibit spectral types of m2-m6 , corresponding to masses from 0.45  @xmath25 to near the hydrogen burning mass limit .",
    "two additional sources in our spectroscopic sample exhibit strong steam absorption bands that are indicative of types later than m8.5 .",
    "if these objects are members of ic  348 rather than field dwarfs , they should have masses of @xmath27  @xmath25 , and thus comprise the least massive known brown dwarfs in the cluster .",
    "accurate spectral types for these two candidates will require either optical spectroscopy or ir spectra at higher signal - to - noise than provided in this work .",
    "classification of the latter data would require ir spectra of optically - classified young objects at types later than the limit of m8.5 in our sample .",
    "near - ir spectra at higher signal - to - noise also would provide the measurements of gravity - sensitive features and reddening that are needed to conclusively establish these candidates as either field dwarfs or young members of ic  348 .",

    "<S> two additional objects exhibit types of @xmath5m8.5 , but can not be conclusively classified as either field dwarfs or cluster members with available data . we have estimated extinctions , luminosities , and effective temperatures for these 16 m - type objects , placed them on the h - r diagram , and used the evolutionary models of chabrier & baraffe to estimate their masses . if the two candidates at @xmath5m8.5 are indeed members , they should be among the least massive known brown dwarfs in ic  348 ( @xmath6 ) . </S>"
