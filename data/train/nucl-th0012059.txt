    "the phenomenological structure of the weak hadronic current between the proton and neutron states is well determined by its properties under the lorentz transformation .",
    "the additional constraints come from the requirement of time reversal symmetry as well as from the invariance under the @xmath10-parity transformation ( combined charge conjugation and isospin rotation ) .",
    "the resulting interaction hamiltonian consists of vector ( v ) , axial vector ( a ) , induced weak magnetism ( m ) , and induced pseudoscalar ( p ) terms together with the associated form factors @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15 .",
    "these form factors are called as coupling constants at zero momentum transfer",
    ". the present experimental knowledge does not exclude the presence of the scalar and tensor interactions .",
    "however , their contribution is expected to be small due to weak couplings @xcite .",
    "the values of vector , axial vector , and weak magnetism couplings are well established by beta - decay experiments as well as by the conserved vector current hypothesis ( cvc ) , introduced already in the late 50 s @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the pseudoscalar coupling is more uncertain , although the partially - conserved axial current hypothesis ( pcac ) @xcite provides an estimate along with muon capture experiments in hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath16 in the nuclear medium is not precisely established .    in nuclear beta decay , with an energy release up to some 20 mev , only the vector ( fermi ) and the axial vector ( gamow  teller ) terms are usually important .",
    "the induced pseudoscalar and weak magnetism parts are essentially inactive , since their contributions are proportional to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy release and @xmath14 is the nucleon mass ( in units where @xmath19 ) .",
    "there are , however , weak nuclear processes , like muon capture , where the energy release is much higher ( in muon capture , typically @xmath20 mev ) .",
    "summed theoretical beta decay strengths are systematically larger than the experimental ones .",
    "this so - called quenching of the ( allowed ) decay strength is usually explained in terms of core polarization ( degrees of freedom which are left out from the model space ) and non - nucleonic degrees of freedom like isobars and meson exchange currents @xcite .",
    "many authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) have established the quenching factors for the gamow  teller decays and closely related magnetic dipole ( @xmath21 ) transitions .",
    "in @xcite we have self - consistently constructed effective operators for the weak hadronic current between proton and neutron states .",
    "these operators , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff ] , take into account the above - mentioned core polarization effects , which are expected to be the largest correction to the bare matrix elements @xcite . in the present work our aim is to calculate self - consistently the quenching for all types of operators ( v , a , m , and p ) for energies up to the muon capture range .",
    "in addition to the traditional shell - model regimes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 shells , we have extended our calculations to @xmath22ni and @xmath23sn as closed - shell cores .    typically one expects about 20% quenching of the axial vector part in the @xmath0 shell , i.e. , the calculated gamow ",
    "teller matrix elements @xmath24 are to be multiplied by a factor @xmath25 @xcite when both core polarization and non - nucleonic degrees are accounted for are then multiplied by @xmath26 . ] .",
    "effects of the same magnitude are expected in the @xmath1 shell @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite reach the conclusion that the mass dependence of the quenching has saturated already in the @xmath1 shell .",
    "however , the major shell closures which separate the spin - orbit partners in @xmath2ni ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and @xmath3sn ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) model spaces introduce large first - order corrections to the operators .",
    "thus , the situation is not analogous to the one seen in light nuclei with closed @xmath33 shells . for a recent work in the sn mass region ,",
    "see e.g. , ref .",
    "we remind the reader that the quenching is always related to the choice of the model space .",
    "the nuclear muon capture process can be used to extract the ratio @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , the results for partial capture rates are very sensitive to applied nuclear model , especially to the model space and to the residual two - body interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the total rates offer perhaps a more reliable source of information , indicating no or only small quenching for the ratio @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to see whether this quenching can be explained in terms of effective charges for the axial vector and pseudoscalar operators , that is , without the complications coming from the nuclear structure calculations .",
    "in addition to the zeroth - order fermi and gamow  teller type operators , our set includes the first - order terms in the transition amplitude ( first order in @xmath17 as well as velocity - dependent terms ) .",
    "we shall also examine the importance of the second - order terms .",
    "we stress that the results obtained in this work can be applied quite generally .",
    "we have used the muon as an initial bound state lepton , but the results apply to electron capture as well and therefore to beta decay in general ( in our calculations , the muon is nothing but a heavy electron ! ) .    in this work , after a short review of the formalism of the semileptonic weak processes in sec .",

    "another feature of e.g. , the gamow  teller - type operators is that for several diagrams involving particle - hole contributions , these diagrams are exactly zero unless the particle - hole orbits are spin - orbit partners .",

    "_ @xcite the meson exchange contribution to the muon capture matrix elements was found to be very small , at least in capture by @xmath191si .",
    "this is , however , in contrast with the results for @xmath192 nuclei of ref.@xcite .",
    "the quenching of the spin matrix element , essentially the gamow  teller matrix element , is expected to be dominated by the core polarization correction @xcite . however , our results leave some room for the subnucleonic corrections .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 shell , about 50% of the observed quenching @xcite comes from the @xmath193 isobars , meson exchange currents and more complicated many - body terms .",
    "the situation is similar also in the beginning of the @xmath1 shell ( @xmath35ca ) .",
    "the second order terms in the invariant amplitude describing the process ( [ reaction ] ) are proportional to @xmath194",
    ". therefore one would expect their contribution to be at most a few percent of the first order terms [ see eqs .  ( [ vector ] ) , ( [ axial ] ) , and ( [ pseudo ] ) ] .",
    "indeed this is the case .",
    "for example in @xmath34o , the @xmath195-dependent single - particle matrix elements which , according to barabanov @xcite , should be the dominating second order terms are about order of magnitude smaller than the first order terms .",
    "only seldomly are the magnitudes roughly equal ( one case in @xmath34o ) .",
    "thus , when the first - order terms are scaled by @xmath196 and second - order terms by @xmath194 , the magnitudes behave roughly as @xmath197 , respectively .",
    "their contribution is , in this context , neglible .",
    "the same conclusion is reached in @xcite , where detailed expressions for the matrix elements are given .",
    "the quenching factors @xmath198 and @xmath199 can be used to estimate the ratio @xmath4 .",
    "we take the data from figs .",
    "[ fig:16 ] , [ fig:40 ] , [ fig:56 ] , and [ fig:100 ] at @xmath5 mev , which corresponds to the muon capture region . then we have @xmath6% , @xmath7% , @xmath8% , and @xmath9% changes in @xmath4 for masses 16 , 40 , 56 , and 100 , respectively . if the bare value is taken from pcac , @xmath200 , we have @xmath201 , 7.8 , 6.0 , and 9.1 for masses 16 , 40 , 56 , and 100 .",
    "this yields an average @xmath202 .",
    "although not directly comparable to our results , it is interesting to note the results of kolbe , langanke , and vogel @xcite .",
    "they used continuum random phase approximation to calculate the part of the capture rate which goes above the particle emission treshold .",
    "their results show a reasonable agreement with data when the bare couplings are used .",
    "this nicely demonstrates the fact that if the model space dimension is increased , the couplings should asymptotically reach the bare values .",
    "we have constructed the effective transition operators corresponding to the general form of the weak hadronic current between the proton and neutron states .",
    "the effects of the renormalization are investigated as a function of the transition @xmath18-value , and an average over the single - particle transitions is taken separately for vector , axial vector and pseudoscalar terms .",
    "we have considered only nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition to the operators present in the allowed beta decay , we have considered the higher - order corrections to the transition amplitudes .    in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 shells ,",
    "we get 19% and 23% quenchings in the axial vector strength , respectively . from these numbers",
    "we can conclude that we have reached the large-@xmath13 limit already in the @xmath1 shell , supporting the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "we have also explained this saturation in qualitative terms . in @xmath2ni and @xmath3sn , where a major shell closure separates the spin - orbit partners , a larger effect is seen .",
    "this is caused by the first order contributions to the effective operator .",
    "the quenching stays nearly constant for energies up to some 60 mev in all cases .",
    "therefore it is justified to speak about energy - independent quenching factors for beta decays in a given mass region .",
    "we also found that the second - order terms ( in inverse nucleon mass ) are relatively unimportant for most calculations .",
    "in particular , the uncertainties in the nuclear model calculations of the one - body transition densities mask these tiny corrections , generally a few percent at maximum .",
    "the quenching factors are used to extract the value of the ratio @xmath4 at @xmath5 mev . in light systems",
    "@xmath34o and @xmath35ca our results indicate a small ( of the order of few percent ) quenching . in @xmath3sn",
    ", we obtain an enhancement of the same order of magnitude . in @xmath2ni a large quenching is seen .    the next step in studies of effective operators",
    "is the inclusion of subnucleonic degrees of freedom in the evaluation of the different diagrams entering the definition of the effective operator .",
    "especially we have in mind the @xmath193-isobars as an intermediate state .",
    "these states have essentially been neglected due the lack of a suitable @xmath203 interaction .",
    "we plan to extend our formalism to include such states through the use of a newly refitted nucleon - nucleon interaction which includes isobars as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "this interaction @xcite accounts for scattering data up to @xmath204 gev in laboratory energy .",
    "the inclusion of meson exchange effects together with the effective transition operators is also a considerable task , not fully attacked yet .",
