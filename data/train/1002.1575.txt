    "in the @xmath0-cold - dark - matter theory of galaxy s formation , dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are suggested to be the  building blocks \" from which larger galaxies were assembled via hierarchical merging and accretion . with their distinctive spheroidal shape , dsphs",
    "are the most common type of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "they have high mass - to - light ratios and are the most dark matter - dominated objects we know . in the local group ( lg )",
    ", they are generally found around the two large spirals , the milky way ( mw ) and m31 .",
    "the mw is surrounded by 10  bright \" dsph satellites spanning a range from a few to about 250 kpc in distance : sagittarius , draco , fornax , carina , sculptor , leo  i , leo  ii , ursa minor ( umi ) , sextans , and the canis major overdensity , whose true nature , whether an actual galaxy or the mw warp , is still matter of debate ( see , e.g. , mateu et al . 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "two further  bright \" dsphs , cetus and tucana , lie more isolated at distances of 780 and 890 kpc , respectively , from the mw . these systems are generally devoid of gas and host predominantly old stellar populations .",
    "all dsphs show in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) prominent red giant branches ( rgbs ) , well extended horizontal branches ( hbs ) , and well populated main sequences ( mss ) . as an example of  bright \" dsph",
    "we show in fig.1 the cmd of umi .",
    "the  bright \" dsphs may also contain some younger stars populating the so called  blue plume \" , as for instance in sagittarius ( see , e.g. , bellazzini et al .",
    "2006 ) , or intermediate - age stars , like in fornax ( see , e.g. , poretti et al . 2008 , and references therein ) , or show complex star formation histories with multiple bursts of star formation , as in carina ( monelli et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the  bright \" dsphs are too few in number , compared to the predictions of the @xmath0-cold - dark - matter theory , and contain only very few stars as metal poor as the stars observed in the galactic halo . since 2005 , 15 new dsph satellites were discovered around the mw ( see , e.g. , moretti et al .",
    "2009 and references therein , for an updated list ) , mainly based on data collected by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "the new galaxies are mainly concentrated around the north galactic pole , as this is the region observed by the sdss , but many more are likely to exist at latitudes not explored yet .",
    "thus the census of the mw satellites is likely to increase significantly when surveys will extend to cover the full sky .",
    "the new dsphs are fainter than the previously known spheroidals , with typical surface brightness @xmath128 mag / arcsec , they are thus named  ultra - faint \" dsphs .",
    "they have properties intermediate between globular clusters ( gcs ) and dsphs , and contain very metal poor stars , as metal poor as [ fe / h]@xmath2 dex .",
    "often the  ultra - faint \" dsphs have irregular shape and appear to be distorted by the tidal interaction with the mw . like their  bright \" counterparts , they have high mass to light ratios .",
    "all  ultra - faint \" dsphs host an ancient population as old as @xmath3 10 gyr , and have gc - like cmds , resembling the cmds of metal poor galactic clusters like m92 , m15 and m68 .",
    "the cmd of an  ultra - faint \" dsph galaxy , ursa major  i ( uma  i ) , is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    the number of the m31 satellites is poorly constrained .",
    "twelve dwarf galaxies were known to be m31 companions until 2004 , among which only 6 dsphs , but several new m31 satellites were discovered afterwards .",
    "the most recent census is reported by martin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) along with the discovery of two new m31 dsph satellites : and xxi and and xxii . as for the mw ,",
    "the number of m31 satellites is likely to increase significantly in the near future .",
    "3 shows the location of  bright \" and  ultra - faint \" dsphs in the absolute magnitude versus half - light radius ( @xmath4 ) diagram .",
    "the plot is an adapted and updated version of belokurov et al .",
    "( 2007 ) fig .",
    "the mw globulars and some of the m31 gcs are also shown in the figure , for a comparison . with their faint luminosities and large dimensions ,",
    "the  ultra - faint \" dwarfs sample a totally unexplored region of @xmath5 plane . among the  ultra - faint \" dsphs only canes venatici  i ( cvn  i ) , the brightest of these systems , lies close to the  bright \" dsphs",
    "the study of the pulsating variable stars offers an additional , very powerful tool to get hints on the structure , formation and evolution of the dsph galaxies , and to infer whether they can have contributed to the formation of the mw and andromeda halos .",
    "the pulsating variables in dsphs include : the sx phoenicis stars , the rr lyrae stars , the bl herculis and w virginis variables ( which are often referred to as population ii cepheids ) , and the anomalous cepheids .",
    "table  1 summarizes their main characteristics . among them ,",
    "the rr lyrae variables are the most common type .",
    "these low mass ( m@xmath6 ) , old ( @xmath7 gyrs ) stars can pulsate in the fundamental radial mode ( rrab ) , in the first overtone mode ( rrc ) or in both modes simultaneously ( rrd ) .",
    "they have been found in  all \" local group galaxies , irrespective of the galaxy morphological type , thus implying that all nearby galaxies started forming stars at an early epoch , just after they were formed .",

    "@xmath17 & hb +    the rr lyrae stars are also primary distance indicators to measure the distance of their host systems , since they obey a luminosity@xmath18metallicity relation ( @xmath19[fe / h ] ) in the visual band , and a period - luminosity@xmath18metallicity ( @xmath20 ) relation in the @xmath21 band . they can be used to map the 3d structure and the radial trends occurring in a galaxy , and to trace halos and streams .",
    "for instance , a local overdensity of rr lyrae stars in the galactic halo turned out to be the northern tidal stream left over by the sagittarius dsph which is disrupting itself into the mw halo , a clear observational evidence of a merging phenomenon still going on today in the mw halo . but most importantly , the rr lyrae stars can provide constrains on whether the mw was formed by accretion of protogalactic fragments resembling the early counterparts of its present - day dsph satellites , since field and cluster rr lyrae stars in the mw show well distinct properties , that should be also shared by any possible contributor to the mw halo . in particular ,",
    "most of the mw gcs containing rr lyrae stars divide into two separate groups according to the mean period of the fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars @xmath22 and the number of fundamental and first overtone pulsators .",
    "this phenomenon is called oosterhoff dichotomy ( oosterhoff 1939 ) .",
    "oosterhoff type i clusters ( ooi ) have @xmath22 = 0.55 days , while oosterhoff type ii clusters ( ooi ) have @xmath22 = 0.64 days ( oosterhoff 1939 ) .",
    "the oosterhoff dichotomy is related to the metallicity , since oo  ii clusters are generally metal poor with [ fe / h]@xmath23 dex , while oo  i clusters are more metal rich , with [ fe / h]@xmath24 dex . in the mw",
    "oo  i and oo  ii gcs lie well separated in the @xmath22 _ versus _ [ fe / h ] plane ( see fig . 2 of smith et al .",
