    "bar - driven gas flows have been proposed to explain the high star formation rates in the nuclei of some starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "star formation is predicted to be enhanced in regions with little shear and/or weak or no shocks , i.e. , where the velocity gradients are small .",
    "these regions are predicted to be found , and in some cases are observed , at the bar ends , along the leading edges of the bar , and at locations within a nuclear ring or spiral .",
    "molecular gas concentrations often appear in these areas , in particular at so - called `` twin peaks '' near the contact points between the dust lanes of the bar and the nuclear ring @xcite .",
    "high resolution images of the molecular gas in the archetypal starburst galaxy ngc 253 suggest that a similar ring of clouds may exist around its nucleus .",
    "specifically , the position - velocity diagram ( pvd ) shows a hole near the center @xcite , though this feature does not unambiguously indicate the presence of a ring @xcite . from cs observations ,",
    "@xcite suggest that much of the dense , star - forming gas in the nucleus of ngc 253 lies in a ring associated with so - called @xmath1 orbits , which are small , elongated orbits perpendicular to the bar @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite conclude from the pvds of  and sio emission in ngc 253 that the dense gas also follows these orbits .",
    "the ratio of hcn and co intensities , an indicator of density , is also elevated 5@xmath2 on either side of the nucleus along the major axis @xcite . indeed , dense gas in the face - on galaxy ngc 6951 appears to follow the @xmath1 orbits closely @xcite , but the low declination and high inclination of ngc 253 ( @xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have hindered similar analysis .",
    "previous high resolution maps of gas emission from ngc 253 either did not trace the bulk of the molecular gas , i. e. , they were most sensitive to dense , shocked or ionized gas @xcite , or they lacked the spatial resolution to isolate individual cloud complexes and their kinematics @xcite .",
    "further , since the first co interferometer map of ngc 253 by @xcite , new images have been made of the stellar and dust distributions @xcite and optically thin gas traced by @xcite . @xcite have also analyzed the co velocity field at high resolution , and with the submillimeter array now operational , interferometric maps of dense and warm gas traced by co  and other lines are certainly imminent . given these new and anticipated data , it is appropriate to reexamine the properties of the molecular gas in ngc 253 but on the spatial scales of individual giant molecular clouds ( @xmath4 pc ) . to this end , we imaged the co emission from ngc 253 with the nobeyama millemeter array . to place",
    "any new work in the proper context will require this relied - upon tracer of the bulk of the star - forming gas in galaxies .",
    "we compare these data to high resolution hcn and  maps @xcite to infer the properties of the molecular clouds and compare them to the kinematics and dust distribution to test how the bar in ngc 253 may drive the central starburst .",
    "the co  data were obtained 1996 january and february from the 6-element nobeyama millimeter array at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) using the ab and c antenna configurations .",
    "the channels were averaged to achieve a velocity resolution of roughly 10 .",
    "the data were gridded with natural weighting , mapped , and cleaned with the nrao aips package .",
    "the fwhm of the synthesized beam is @xmath0 , with a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath5 .",
    "the total integrated co  flux smoothed to 43@xmath6 is 3670 jy beam@xmath7 , roughly 50%  of the single - dish integrated intensity @xcite .",
    "we recovered a 2.6 mm continuum map by averaging the line - free channels in the data cube .",
    "we also created a continuum image from a linear baseline subtraction within the datacube .",
    "both methods produced nearly identical continuum maps .",
    "the emission appears unresolved , but may be marginally resolved only along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the peak flux is @xmath8 mjy , which is consistent with similar measurements @xcite .",
    "the co map originally appeared to have a registration offset from previous work .",
    "the large angular distance of @xmath9 ( mostly north ) to the phase calibrator 0050 - 094 may be the cause , though no strong phase variations were found during the observations . to properly compare this map to previous work",
    ", we aligned the 2.6 mm continuum source with the nuclear radio source of @xcite . a total shift ( mostly north ) of roughly @xmath10",
    "was required .",
    "a subsequent minor adjustment in declination was made to align the major axis and velocity centroid ( @xmath11 ) of the co emission with those of the high resolution hcn map .",
    "this adjustment was a small fraction of the beam width in declination . in summary , the central velocity field , which is roughly perpendicular to the major axis ,",
    "constrains the r.a .",
    "offset , and the declination offset is mostly constrained by the cloud distribution along the major axis .",
    "judging from the alignment of the continuum sources , major axes and velocity fields , we estimate that the co map is aligned to within half a beam width in r.a . and decl .",
    "( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ; the beam is oriented nearly north - south ) with the radio continuum , hcn and maps .",
    "maps of the integrated co intensity and velocity field are shown in figure  [ fig.moms ] .",
    "figure  [ fig.chmaps ] shows the co channel maps .",
    "the general morphology and velocity field are consistent with other high resolution maps @xcite .",
    "there is an extended ridge of emission aligned with the infrared bar at a pa of @xmath14 , and a central group of bright clouds aligned with the major axis of the galaxy ( pa = @xmath15 , @xcite ) orbiting the radio nucleus in a possible ring .",
    "the kinematics of these features are discussed below .",
    "the co emission is somewhat more extended than the maps of dense gas tracers such as hcn and , with intense emission at the radio nucleus and the mid - infrared peak @xcite .",
    "the co peak appears to lie between the thermal radio sources , unlike the hcn emission which at the same resolution is strongly coincident with the thermal sources .",
    "the co spectra agree well with the @xmath16 resolution data of @xcite and the @xmath17 resolution co  data @xcite .",
    "we even recover many double - peaked spectra as seen at @xmath16 resolution .",
    "the line widths of the new data are slightly narrower than , and the peak line temperatures higher than previous work , indicating that we are better resolving the star - forming clouds . the overall co  and  distributions and pvds at similar resolution are comparable , though the new map resolves the emission for the first time into small - scale complexes . also for the first time at these spatial scales , the ratio of the co  and integrated intensities is found to be @xmath18 over much of the map , implying optically thick gas .",
    "the gas properties are discussed below .",
    "the co emission is compared to the 2mass @xmath19 and @xmath20 maps @xcite in figure  [ fig.2mass ] .",
    "the @xmath19 map clearly shows the bar and some of the ring structure around the nucleus . the wide - field",
    ", @xmath16 resolution map of @xcite indicates that the co closely traces the infrared bar distribution .",
    "the new co map shows that the small - scale co distribution in the central arcminute matches up with the dust in the bar .",
    "the bar appears to have leading dust ridges that meet up with the nuclear co emission .",
    "this morphology is typical for twin - peaks galaxies .",
    "the extended ridge of emission and central cloud distribution have distinct velocity structures according to the co velocity field .",
    "the central clouds move around the radio nucleus as a solid body with a pa of @xmath21 ( figure  [ fig.moms ] ) , similar to the distribution of the thermal radio sources , central hcn clouds and central near - infrared emission @xcite .",
    "however , unlike what is expected for solid - body rotation , the velocity field of these clouds is not exactly perpendicular to the cloud distribution .",
    "this result was seen by @xcite as well , and may result from unresolved , complex gas motions at the nucleus .",
    "the gas kinematics are discussed more extensively in section  [ kin ] .",
    "the peak co flux is quite high , @xmath22 mjy beam@xmath7 , corresponding to a line brightness temperature of @xmath23 k. given a likely beam filling factor below unity implies hot clouds ( @xmath24 k ) in the nucleus of ngc 253 , consistent with single - dish studies of higher frequency co transitions @xcite .",
    "to estimate the physical properties of the clouds in ngc 253 , we compare the co data with maps of hcn and  at similar resolution @xcite , and model the emission .",
    "the model assumes the emission originates in unresolved , homogeneous , spherical clouds . a photon escape probability function",
    "is included to account for the radiative excitation of optically thick lines @xcite .",
    "we model the emission from the first 11 levels of co and first 8 levels of hcn .",
    "the collision rate coefficients are from the literature ( co : flower & launay 1985 ; hcn : green & thaddeus 1974 ) .",
    "we vary the [ co]/ [ ] abundance ratio from 30 , appropriate for galactic center clouds @xcite , to 50 , which was derived from a lower limit to the cn/@xmath25cn intensity ratio in ngc 253 @xcite .    to take advantage of the highest resolution data , we begin by modeling only the ratio of integrated intensities of hcn and co , which we refer to as simply hcn / co . to this analysis we then include the somewhat lower resolution  data to further constrain the results ( figure  [ fig.rats ] ) . with each new modeled species ,",
    "we assume relative abundances and degrade the resolution on the map , but the relative cloud properties , i.e. , gradients over 40100 pc scales , are well constrained in the end .",
    "all maps were aligned by the emission distributions on the major axis , available continuum positions , and velocity fields as described above .",
    "the hcn / co ratio is sensitive to the volume density , but the kinetic temperature , @xmath26 and co column density are not well constrained .",
    "we estimate @xmath26 iteratively as in @xcite using the co line brightness temperature , such that @xmath27 k. the factor @xmath28 accounts for non - thermal excitation , beam dilution and opacity . the emission is initially assumed to be thermalized and optically thick ( @xmath29 , the area beam filling factor ) .",
    "the column density is initially estimated by assuming a constant conversion factor between the co integrated intensity and the molecular gas column density , @xmath30 ( ) @xmath7 @xcite , and a co abundance .",
    "this beam - averaged column density is converted to a cloud column density with the beam filling factor .",
    "the final beam filling factor is found by comparing the observed co temperature with the value predicted by the model .",
    "obviously the choice of @xmath31 affects the resultant columns and temperatures .",
    "the relative hcn and co abundances are varied for different model runs , but remain within the range of predicted and observed values for dense galactic clouds @xcite .",
    "we also adjust the relative hcn and co beam filling factors to account for the likely smaller sizes of the hcn clouds .",
    "this adjustment generally only affects the resultant density .    by including the co/  integrated intensity ratio at @xmath32 resolution @xcite , we better constrain the column density .",
    "valid solutions are found from the minimum @xmath33 ( for @xmath34 ) with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 k. the parameter @xmath31 is no longer a necessary input .",
    "given these criteria , we choose the best solution at the lowest @xmath26 with @xmath34 .",
    "given that temperature , the solution for co column density per velocity interval and  volume density are found from the minimum @xmath33 . minimizing @xmath26 tends to assign slightly higher densities , lower column densities , higher beam filling factors and of course cooler temperatures to the clouds .",
    "typically a wide range of valid temperature solutions results , though relative cloud properties ( gradients ) are well represented with this procedure .",
    "we do not vary the relative  and co beam filling factors , that is , we assume they are the same based on the clumpy nature of clouds . even in massive star formation regions , where isotope - selective photodissociation ( ispd ) may reduce the abundance of the less well - shielded molecular species , these lines appear to originate from essentially the same volume of gas over 100 pc scales ( e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further , ispd does not seem to be important over large spatial scales in the centers of ngc 253 or other co - bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab.models ] lists the model inputs and resultant average cloud properties .",
    "models a1a5 consider only the hcn / co ratio and initial beam filling factor , @xmath31 .",
    "models b1b5 consider the hcn / co and co/  ratios , and solve for the cloud conditions from the minimum @xmath33 and assuming the minimum valid @xmath26 .",
    "maps of @xmath26 , co column and  volume density ( @xmath38 and ) , and beam filling factor are displayed for model solutions a1 and b2 in figures  [ fig.soln1 ] and [ fig.soln2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig.hist ] shows the distributions of cloud properties for model b2 .",
    "varying the model inputs does not greatly affect the morphology seen in the maps , though the contour values change , as mentioned before @xcite .",
    "therefore we restrict our discussion to the relative gas properties and how they vary with position .",
    "however it is worth mentioning how the model inputs affect the results . as expected , a high fractional hcn abundance or high @xmath39 ratio results in lower  density solutions .",
    "similarly , a high fractional  abundance ( low [ co]/ ] ) results in lower column density solutions .",
    "the solution from model b2 ( figures  [ fig.soln2 ] and [ fig.hist ] ) illustrates the effect of using the minimum temperature .",
    "the northeastern region of ngc 253 is predicted to have relatively low temperatures ( @xmath40 k ) , but the beam filling factor there approaches unity ( @xmath41 ) and the column densities are also relatively low ( @xmath42 ) , both of which are expected consequences of underestimating the temperature .",
    "note however , that these presumably `` low '' temperature limits average a warm 50 k. indeed , kinetic temperatures in this general region of ngc 253 derived from nh@xmath43 observations are predicted to exceed 140 k @xcite . our derived temperature of over 200 k in the southwest is twice the estimate from nh@xmath43 , but considering the difference in resolution between these datasets , and that both studies yield limits to @xmath26 , the agreement is reasonable .",
    "given that the southwestern cloud is also the mid - ir peak and coincident with a bright cluster of massive stars @xcite , such high temperatures are not wholly unexpected .",
    "using the resultant gas properties and the radiative transfer model , we derive expected co ( ) / ( ) intensity ratios varying from 1.0 to 1.7 across the central area of the map . though difficult to compare with our map , the  observations of @xcite appear to be consistent with the results .",
    "we expect ratios of 11.5 in the central region of the map , and only model b1 , with the galactic center  abundance , disagrees in that it predicts co ( ) / ( ) @xmath44 over most of the map .",
    "the central peaks in temperature , volume and column density are more or less symmetrically distributed around the kinematic center of ngc 253 .",
    "they also flank the area of solid body rotation at the nucleus and lie perpendicular to the rotation axis of the region ( figure  [ fig.ratv ] ) .",
    "these warm and dense clouds could therefore very well be part of a nuclear ring as seen in twin - peaks galaxies .",
    "( note that the very high temperatures derived in models b1b5 are still lower limits based on the modeling procedure . )",
    "figure  [ fig.ratv ] shows the variation in the orbital velocity and hcn / co ratio along the major axis of this supposed ring .",
    "the density peaks appear at the ends of the central region of solid body rotation where velocity gradients are lower , and star formation may occur more readily .",
    "we examine the cloud kinematics to estimate the effect of the bar on driving star formation at the locations of the dense nuclear clouds in ngc 253 .",
    "we primarily search for inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) and regions of overlapping orbits and/or low velocity gradients by analyzing the co rotation curve and by modeling the bar potential .",
    "because ngc 253 is nearly edge - on , we use a terminal velocity method , similar to the iteration method of @xcite , to determine the rotation curve from the pvd ( figure  [ fig.pvd ] ) .",
    "the pvd is created by first rotating the co data cube by @xmath15 , the pa of the major axis @xcite . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , we average the co spectra within @xmath45 of the major axis , which roughly matches the beam extent .",
    "the rotation curve is estimated at each point along the major axis from the maximum velocity , corrected for inclination , at which emission was detected above the @xmath46 level in at least two contiguous channels . from this velocity",
    "we subtract ( in quadrature ) the half - width values of the line broadening due to beam smearing , the 10  channel width and the turbulence of the interstellar medium ( assumed to be 10 ) .",
    "the beam smearing is estimated from the gradient in the rotation curve @xmath47 around each position .",
    "we then use the co emission distribution and the derived rotation curve to recreate the pvd .",
    "the differences between the observed and modeled pvds are used to correct the rotation curve , and a new model pvd is created .",
    "this procedure is repeated and monitored until convergence .",
    "the high inclination of ngc 253 allows us to derive the radial gas distribution , @xmath48 , from the observed axial co distribution , @xmath49 , unlike the more general technique of @xcite .",
    "they assume that the radial distribution is proportional to the observed , axial distribution .",
    "however , for highly inclined galaxies , foreground gas contributes significantly to the emission seen towards the central positions .",
    "assuming a semi - circular ( treating the eastern and western halves separately ) , axisymmetric disk geometry ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the section of an annulus between radii @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and major axis positions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is half the pixel separation along the major axis .",
    "the radial distribution is then derived from the outermost observed point ,    @xmath57    and back - substitution using    @xmath58/ \\delta a(x_j , r_j).\\ ] ]    the resulting rotation curve is displayed with the pvd in figure  [ fig.pvd ] .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "difference between the observed and reconstructed pvd contours ( at @xmath46 , and 20% , 30% , ...",
    "90%  of the peak ) is 25 .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "difference between the @xmath46 level of the pvd , corrected for inclination , and the rotation curve is 11 . except near the nucleus ,",
    "the observed and modeled spectra agree reasonably well , particularly the line widths and central velocities ; even some double - peaked spectra are reproduced .",
    "both sides reach the same `` turnover '' velocity of @xmath59  at the same circumnucler distance of @xmath60 ( 50 pc for @xmath61 mpc ) .",
    "the rotation curve is somewhat asymmetric in that the western side drops more quickly and has a lower final velocity than the eastern side .",
    "a simple offset in the velocity centroid position and/or systemic velocity can not account for this asymmetry .",
    "for example , no offset in the adopted central position along the major axis results in a symmetric radial gas distribution , @xmath48 .",
    "a similar asymmetry is seen in other tracers such as co ,  and  at comparable resolution @xcite , but the large - scale h  i  and co velocities are more symmetric and confirm the adopted systemic velocity @xcite . near the nucleus , the line widths of the modeled spectra underestimate the observed line widths , and are relatively featureless in comparison . apparently the linear gradient assumed near the nucleus is an oversimplification of the true gas dynamics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is also likely that the intrinsic linewidths due to turbulence are higher near the nucleus .      star formation in nuclear rings is predicted to occur because of cloud collisions or gravitational instability near ilrs ( e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we search for expected resonances in ngc 253 using the derived rotation curve .",
    "the bar pattern speed @xmath62 is estimated from the orbital velocity observed at a radius 20%  beyond the ends of the bar and associated stellar ring @xcite .",
    "the stellar bar and ring in ngc 253 are very well defined from recent mid- and near - infrared measurements by 2mass and the msx satellite @xcite , and from  imaging @xcite .",
    "the bar is symmetric about the adopted dynamical center of the galaxy and terminates at the ring at a projected radius of @xmath63 ( figure  [ fig.2mass ] ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath64 kpc@xmath7 , the pattern speed derived from co and  spectra @xcite .    from the gas angular velocity @xmath65 derived from the rotation curve , @xmath66",
    ", we calculate the epicyclic frequency ,    @xmath67    ilrs are predicted at radii where @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig.omega ] shows the angular speed evaluated using each side of the rotation curve separately , and the weighted average of the eastern and western rotation curves .",
    "though no clear ilr is apparent , @xmath69 approaches the pattern speed near radii of @xmath70@xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we will only dicuss the possible inner ilr since our observations do not effectively probe the outer ilr at @xmath72 .",
    "the density peaks from the hcn / co analysis occur only @xmath73 from the nucleus , implying that they either lie inside this possible ilr , or are seen in projection .",
    "figure  [ fig.twinp ] compares the hcn / co and 2mass @xmath20 maps .",
    "the leading dust lanes end at the central near - infrared features , which are coincident with the millimeter continuum peak and are aligned with the distribution of molecular gas density .",
    "the projected pa of the bar minor axis is @xmath74 , which is close to that of the dense clouds .",
    "in fact , the dense clouds may lead the minor axis of the bar as seen in the twin - peaks galaxy ngc 6951 @xcite . in ngc 253 ,",
    "the coincidence and alignment of the density peaks , bar axes and possible ilr imply that ngc 253 is likely a twin - peaks galaxy , and the bar drives star formation around its nucleus .",
    "the observed gas distribution and rotation curve are difficult to reconcile with the typical model describing symmetric stellar orbits in a bar potential .",
    "it is likely that gas is not uniformly distributed along the predicted stellar orbits as is seen even in the center of most face - on , twin - peaks galaxies @xcite . nevertheless , in an attempt to explain the observed gas motions and density variations as an effect of the bar , we examine the expected orbits in the center of ngc 253 as in the literature @xcite . with likely ilrs in ngc 253",
    ", we may adopt the bar potential @xcite    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the limiting velocity , bar asymmetry parameter and core radius , respectively .",
    "adjusting these parameters to fit the pvd , we can estimate the gas orbits in this potential ( figure  [ fig.twinp ] ) .",
    "the dense gas near the center of ngc 253 seems to lie near , or slightly lead , the inner @xmath1 orbits , just as in ngc 6951 .",
    "the regions where the @xmath79 and @xmath1 orbits overlap also coincide with the possible inner ilr .",
    "fully hydrodynamic models of gas motions in a bar potential also support this picture that most star formation occurs near the intersection regions of these different orbit families where gas collisions cause shocks ( e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we present the co distribution and kinematics in the starburst nucleus of ngc 253 .",
    "the molecular gas is concentrated in several complexes which are associated with both the near - infrared bar and likely `` twin peaks '' around the radio nucleus .",
    "the gas densities , temperatures and column densities are highest in these presumed twin peaks .",
    "the co kinematics indicate that the density peaks may also coincide with an inner ilr just beyond the region of solid body rotation around the nucleus . even without an ilr , the velocity gradient decreases near the peaks as well , which could also explain the star formation there .",
    "analysis of the rotation curve and expected gas motions in a bar potential , compared with the locations of enhanced gas density , lead us to conclude that the stellar bar drives the star formation in the starburst nucleus of ngc 253 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the likely presence of at least one ilr , gas motions consistent with @xmath79 and @xmath1 orbits , leading dust ridges along the infrared bar , and an apparent twin peaks morphology .",
