    "there is a category @xmath0 whose objects are finite - dimensional symplectic manifolds @xmath1 and whose morphisms are symplectomorphisms @xmath2 . in attempting to understand the quantization procedure of physicists from a mathematical perspective , one may think of it as a functor from this symplectic category , where classical mechanics takes place , into the category of hilbert spaces and unitary operators , which is the realm of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is well known that the category @xmath0 is too large , since there are `` no - go '' theorems that show that the group of all symplectomorphisms on @xmath1 does not act in a physically meaningful way on a corresponding hilbert space .",
    "one standard remedy for this is to replace @xmath0 with a smaller category , replacing the symplectomorphism groups with certain finite - dimensional subgroups .",
    "another is to replace the hilbert spaces and operators by objects depending on a formal parameter .",
    "but there is also a sense in which the category @xmath0 is too _ small _ , since it does not contain morphisms corresponding to operators such as projectors and the self - adjoint ( or skew - adjoint ) operators that play the role of observables in quantum mechanics , nor can it encode the algebra structure itself on the space of observables .",
    "( this collection of observables is not actually a hilbert space , but certain sets of operators do carry a vector space structure , with the inner product associated to the hilbert - schmidt norm . )    to enlarge the symplectic category , we look at the `` dictionary '' of quantization , following , for example , @xcite . in this dictionary , the cartesian product of symplectic manifolds corresponds to the tensor product of hilbert spaces , and replacing a symplectic manifold @xmath1 with @xmath3 ( which we denote by @xmath4 when we omit the symplectic structure from the notation for a given symplectic manifold ) corresponds to replacing a hilbert space @xmath5 by its conjugate , or dual , space @xmath6 .",
    "thus , if symplectic manifolds @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to hilbert spaces @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the product @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath12 , which , with a suitable definition of the tensor product , is a space @xmath13 of linear operators from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "another entry in the dictionary says that lagrangian submanifolds ( perhaps carrying half - densities ) in symplectic manifolds correspond to vectors or lines in hilbert space .",
    "combining this idea with the one in the previous paragraph , we conclude that lagrangian submanifolds in @xmath11 should correspond to linear operators from @xmath9 to @xmath10.this suggests that , if the space of observables @xmath5 for a quantum system corresponds to a symplectic manifold @xmath14 , then the algebra structure on @xmath5 should be given by a lagrangian submanifold @xmath15 in @xmath16 the algebra axioms of unitality and associativity should be encoded by monoidal properties of @xmath15 in an extended symplectic category , @xmath17 , where the morphisms from @xmath14 to @xmath18 are the canonical relations ; i.e. , all the lagrangian submanifolds of @xmath11 ( not just those which are the graphs of symplectomorphisms ) and where the morphism composition is the usual composition of relations .",
    "however , a problem immediately occurs : the composition of canonical relations may yield relations that are not submanifolds any more , and thus are not canonical relations !",
    "@xmath17 is then not a true category , as the morphisms can not always be composed .",
    "it is rather awkward to speak about a quantization functor in this context .",
    "there have already been several approaches to remedy this defect .",
    "one approach , developed by guillemin and sternberg in @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent version ) , is to consider only symplectic vector spaces and linear canonical relations .",
    "another , suggested by wehrheim and woodward in @xcite , is to enlarge the category still further by allowing arbitrary `` formal '' products of canonical relations and equating them to actual products when the latter exist as manifolds .    in this paper , we take yet another approach .",
    "we construct a version of the extended symplectic `` category , '' which is a true category , by localizing it around lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "its objects , called symplectic microfolds in the spirit of milnor s microbundles ( @xcite ) , are equivalence classes @xmath19 $ ] of pairs consisting of a symplectic manifold @xmath14 and a lagrangian submanifold @xmath20 , called the core .",
    "the equivalence reflects the fact that these objects really describe the geometry of a neighborhood @xmath21 or a `` micro '' neighborhood @xmath21 of @xmath22 in @xmath14 .",
    "in this `` micro '' setting , there is also a notion of canonical `` micro '' relations between two symplectic microfolds : they are lagrangian submicrofolds @xmath23 $ ] of the symplectic microfold product @xmath24\\times[n , b]$ ] .",
    "their composition is generally as ill behaved as it is for regular canonical relations .",
    "one of the main points of this paper is to identify a certain subset of canonical `` micro '' relations satisfying a new transversality condition which ensures the composition is always well defined .",
    "we consider these transverse `` micro '' canonical relations as morphisms between symplectic microfolds ; in this way , we obtain a new symmetric monoidal category : the extended microsymplectic category .",
    "the extended symplectic `` category '' has been used as a sort of heuristic guideline in an attempt to quantize poisson manifolds ( see @xcite ) in a geometric way .",
    "these attempts have been only partially successful due in part to the existence of nonintegrable poisson manifolds ( hence restricting the class of poisson manifold one can quantize ) , as well as to the ill - defined composition of canonical relations ( limiting thus the functorial properties of these geometric quantization methods ) .",
    "the replacement of the extended symplectic `` category '' by its `` micro '' version provides new ways of dealing with both issues .",
    "this paper lays the foundation for a series of work that revolves around two main themes : the categorification of poisson geometry and its functorial quantization as explained below .",
    "since @xmath25 is a monoidal category , it is natural to consider its category of algebras @xmath26 .",
    "the main statement we are aiming at here is the equivalence between this latter category and the category of poisson manifolds and poisson maps .",
    "future research directions will include the study of a weakened version of @xmath26 whose algebra maps are replaced by bimodules .",
    "this should correspond to a `` micro '' morita theory for poisson manifolds .",
    "our second line of work will focus on constructing a monoidal functor from the extended microsymplectic category ( enhanced with half - density germs on the morphisms ) to the category of vector spaces .",
    "since monoidal functors between monoidal categories induce functors between their respective categories of monoid objects , we obtain in this way a `` quantization '' functor from the category of poisson manifolds to the category of algebras in @xmath27 .",

    "we choose to use `` symplectomorphism '' instead of `` microsymplectomorphism '' , and so on .",

    "actually , this theorem was first stated and proved using the language of local manifold pairs and their equivalences ( see @xcite ) .",

    "canonical relations are usually thought of as `` generalized symplectomorphisms '' and written as @xmath75 instead of @xmath71 .",
    "the rationale behind this is twofold : the graph of a symplectomorphism is a canonical relation , and it is formally possible to extend the composition of symplectomorphisms to canonical relations .",
    "namely , the composition of @xmath71 and @xmath76 is the subset of @xmath77 defined by@xmath78 where @xmath79 is the `` reduction '' map that projects @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",

    "the composition @xmath82 is exactly the quotient of @xmath83 by the characteristic foliation of @xmath85 .",

    "it is called the @xmath88 @xmath53 `` @xmath89 '' and will be denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "many constructions in @xmath0 extend to @xmath17 .",

    "we will often prefer the notation @xmath98,k)$ ] for canonical relations and reserve the notation @xmath19 $ ] for symplectic microfolds in order to distinguish between objects and morphisms .",
