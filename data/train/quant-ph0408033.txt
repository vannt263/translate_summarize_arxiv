    "quantum information usually can be represented by states of photons @xcite or atomic / ionic states @xcite . in a classical quantum computation scheme based on cavity - qed of ref .",
    "@xcite , qubits are represented by the polarized states of photons , and high - finesse optical microcavities with atoms are used to provide nonlinear interactions between photons . however , the storage of single - photon information and feeding of single photons into / out of cavities are still experimental challenges for large - scale quantum computation . in the other case ,",
    "qubits are represented by atomic states , which are ideal for the storage of quantum information , and photons transmit information among atoms , which are the best long - distance carriers of quantum information .",
    "an important precondition for the case is so - called regime of strong coupling in cavity - qed .",
    "experimentally , the condition has been realized @xcite or is theoretically feasible in different optical cavities , such as micropost microcavity @xcite , fabry - perot bulk optical cavity @xcite , photonic crystal @xcite and microsphere cavity @xcite , etc . among them , whispering gallery modes of silica - microsphere get especial attentions because of their ultrahigh factor @xmath0 and small mode volume .    very recently , l .- m .",
    "duan and h. j. kimble have proposed a new interesting scheme to carry out quantum controlled phase flip ( cpf ) @xcite , where qubits are encoded as coherent superposition of polarized states of single - photon pulses .",
    "they assumed @xmath1 , which means longer storage time of single photons is needed , and thus it brings on a challenge for maintaining photons coherent , and here @xmath2is the decay rate of the cavity mode field itself , and @xmath3 is the single - photon pulse duration .",
    "the experimental scheme presented here tries to overcome these difficulties by using atomic rare earth ions embedded in microsphere cavities .",
    "qubits are represented by hyperfine ground states of ions , which provides less storage time of single - photon pulses and better scalability .",
    "the basic model here is first built on single three - level atoms trapped in fabry - perot cavities , and single three - level ions embedded in microsphere cavities will be discussed in the section iv later . as illustrated in fig . 1a ,",
    "atomic states @xmath4  and @xmath5 are two stable ground states , and state @xmath6is a low excited state .",
    "a single - photon pulse is reflected by the two cavity - atom subsystems in sequence , and the cpf gate for the two atoms is realized by a series of these simple reflections and some local unitary operations .",
    "the single - photon pulse is initially prepared in an equal coherent superposition of two orthogonal polarization components and can be expressed as @xmath7 .",
    "qubits are represented by arbitrary coherent superposition of the two atomic ground states , and the initial state is prepared as @xmath8 , where @xmath9is arbitrary superposition coefficients , @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11 or @xmath12 , @xmath13 denotes the state @xmath14or",
    "@xmath15  , with relations : @xmath16 .",
    "the atomic transition @xmath17  is resonant with a cavity mode of interest , which has @xmath18 polarization and is resonantly driven by the @xmath18 polarization component of the input single - photon pulse .",
    "the cpf gate between the atom and the photon can be described by the unitary operator @xcite@xmath19 from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath4 component obtains a phase of @xmath20 while @xmath5 component keeps unchanged during the interaction with @xmath18 polarization component of the input single - photon pulse .",
    "it is very insensitive to the variation of the coupling rate @xmath21 even if @xmath21 is not much higher than @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the cpf gate between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , _ _ which is generated by combination of several gates @xmath23 and single - bit rotation operations can be described by the unitary operator @xmath24 it is the most important unitary operator in our protocol which has the following operator identity @xmath25 where @xmath26  is a single - bit operating on the single - photon pulse , and the transforming relations are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "so the steps to realize the cpf gate between @xmath11 and @xmath12 are as follows , and the overall processes are shown in fig .",

    "for the sake of clarity and concision , we discuss @xmath23  for a single - photon pulse and a cavity - atom subsystem , and cpf gate between atoms is generated by simple orderly combination of @xmath23 and some local unitary operations .",

    "in order to take numerical simulation for the theoretical results of the previous section , it is necessary to consider a practicable system and take some practical parameter estimations .",
    "first of all , we consider silica - microsphere cavities instead of fabry - perot cavities for better strong coupling conditions and physical scalability . in the silica - microsphere cavity , whispering - gallery modes ( wgms )",
    "are supported . in a ray - optics picture ,",
    "wgms correspond to light traveling around the equator of a microsphere , and characterized by mode numbers @xmath74 and their polarizations ( @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) , where @xmath77 is the radial and@xmath78 are angular mode numbers respectively .",
    "what we are most interested in is the so - called fundamental wgm ( @xmath79 ) which corresponds to the highest quality factor @xmath0 and the smallest volume @xmath80 .",
    "quality factor @xmath0 of wgm can reach extremely high , up to @xmath81 in experiments @xcite , and thus strong coupling conditions are more easily obtained than that by f - p cavity @xcite . in the recent work ,",
    "one group has just mentioned a quantum computation protocol through microsphere - cavity - assisted interaction @xcite . in order to achieve good coupling between photons and wgms ,",
    "being different from f - p cavity ( direct coupling is obtainable through one mirror of the cavity ) , near field evanescent wave couplers are required to provide efficient coupling without disturbing the high-@xmath0 character of the microsphere cavity , and fiber tapers @xcite or stripline pedestal anti - resonant reflecting optical waveguides ( sparrow ) @xcite are usually used for critical coupling @xcite .",
    "2 shows the coupling between two fiber tapers and a microsphere , i.e. the realization of gate @xmath82 between an ion and a photon . for a single @xmath75 type wgm",
    ", the @xmath18 polarization component of the input pulse can couple into ( out of ) microsphere cavity via @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , while the @xmath85 polarization component will pass the coupling region and can not couple into the microsphere cavity , and in essence , it is equivalent to the reflection by the mirror @xmath86 . thus the physical setup is simpler than that of f - p cavity because it has no @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 and just need to control the working - state of switches @xmath90 and @xmath91 with low time precision . combining the advantages of fiber taper and microsphere cavity , the system not only achieves best coupling efficiency ( the efficiency is up to @xmath92 when critical coupling is achieved ) @xcite but also supplies good cascadibility .",
    "secondly , we replace the neutral atoms by atomic trivalent rare earth ions @xmath93 ( such as @xmath94 or @xmath95 , here we adopt @xmath95 ) for longer coherence time and lower spontaneous emission rate . quantum computation using rare - earth ions",
    "have also been proposed by several groups @xcite .",
    "quantum information can be stored in the ground state structure for long periods of time ( up to 82 @xmath96 @xcite ) and it is insensitive to the electric dipole - dipole interaction . in our scheme , the states @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively @xmath97 and @xmath98 ,  and @xmath99 is @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "we assume a single ion @xmath95 lies in the inner surface of the microsphere , which is also the primary distributed position of the fundamental wgm ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the radii of each microsphere here is about @xmath101 @xmath102 , and mode volume @xmath80  is about @xmath103 @xmath104 at @xmath105 @xmath106 ; the @xmath0 factor can be up to @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the maximum coherent coupling rate of an individual ion to the resonant wgm @xcite is given by @xmath108 @xmath109 ; here we let @xmath110 @xmath111 .",
    "decay rate of the mode@xmath112@xmath113@xmath3@xmath114 @xmath115 for @xmath116 .",
    "last key parameter about strong coupling conditions is ionic decay rate to modes other than the cavity mode of interest .",
    "it is reasonable to assume @xmath117 @xmath118  here because lifetime of spontaneous emission in the excited state of rare earth can reach several @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "sum up all the above , @xmath119 can be satisfied in our scheme ; i.e. , strong coupling between single ion and microsphere cavity mode can be easily realized .    based on above parameter estimations",
    ", we prove that we have realized the cpf gate via numerical simulations . in fig .",
    "3a , we show ionic phase variation under gate @xmath82 for different @xmath120 , @xmath121 @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126  denote final ionic phase after @xmath18 polarization component of the photon is reflected by cavity - ion subsystem when the ionic state is @xmath127 or @xmath5 , and @xmath128 or @xmath129  are final ionic phases in the absence of cavity - ion subsystem during time @xmath3 ( it means photon s free propagation in vacuum ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath130   $ ] , @xmath131   $ ] , @xmath132   $ ] , @xmath133   $ ] .  from the two curves , it is obvious that @xmath134 is very close to @xmath135 , and @xmath136 nearly equals @xmath137 in the frequency range of single - photon pulse .",
    "we also obtain the fidelity of the cpf gate for a single ion and a single photon .",
    "3b shows the gate fidelity associated with different pulse duration @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath138 can reach extremely high even when @xmath139 . in our estimations , @xmath138 is up to @xmath140 for @xmath141 @xmath115 .",
    "the other important parameter of quantum logic gates in quantum computation is error rate .",
    "the dominant noise in our scheme is photon loss during gate operations , which is especially aroused from ionic spontaneous emission , and leads to uncontrolled free evolution of ionic states ; per contra , ions evolve governed by hamiltonian @xmath142 when the single photon is in the cavity .",
    "taking a rough estimation for this case , probability of spontaneous emission loss ( @xmath143 ) is about @xmath144 for per gate @xmath82 even when @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "so our scheme has the ability to accomplish quantum fault - tolerance codes ( error threshold is about @xmath146 ) @xcite if we neglect all classical photon loss ( for instance , coupling inefficiency between fiber tapers and microspheres ) .",
    "now we discuss some technical details of our scheme .",
    "rare earth ions are characterized by partially full @xmath147 orbitals and their spectroscopy is dominated by @xmath148 transitions .",
    "the electrons involved in these transitions are inside filled @xmath149 and @xmath150 orbitals , which screen them from perturbations caused by the lattice @xcite .",
    "once a single ion has been embedded in a silica - microsphere , it has nearly determinate crystal field environment , and the fluctuation of its crystal field  is so small that linewidths of around @xmath151 @xmath152 for a transition in the visible have been reported @xcite .",
    "these linewidths are right so - called homogeneous broading @xmath153 . on the other hand , for different ions , they have different crystal field environments and hence different optical transition frequencies .",
    "this kind of behavior brings large inhomogeneous broading @xmath154 , up to several @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "large inhomogeneous broading is a significant challenge for our scheme , since single photons should be kept resonant with ionic transitions , but obviously , it is not a natural corollary of the aforementioned protocol .",
    "in order to get over the effect derived from this inhomogeneous broading , we improve our protocol to be more potential . simply , we could only add two acousto - optical ( ao ) shifters in fig .",
    "2 . one ( ao shifter 1 ) is in front of the couplers , and the other ( ao shifter 2 ) is mounted rearward .",
    "in other words , the single - photon pulse will be modulated in the frequency domain by ao shifters before and after reflection by the cavity .",
    "for instance , the central frequency of the transition ( @xmath155 ) is assumed @xmath156 for the @xmath10th ion .",
    "the central frequency of the incident single - photon pulse  is @xmath157 , and the frequency increases ( decreases ) @xmath158 after it passes through ao shifter 1 ( 2 ) . in actual quantum computers",
    ", we can fabricate a number of microspheres in which single ions are imbedded .",
    "then we analyse their frequency spectrums one by one , and range the ions by their central frequencies by ascending order .",
    "every cavity - ion subsystem includes two additional ao shifters , and thus the single - photon pulse with central frequency @xmath157 can sufficiently interact with every ion embedded in the respective microsphere .",
    "furthermore , wgms in microsphere have been tuned successfully by several methods @xcite , and thus cavity modes are always able to keep resonant with ionic transitions . on second thoughts , however , we may even design  an elegant scheme to use the inhomogeneous broading as a constructive factor of quantum logic gates , instead of fighting against its destructive characteristic .",
    "for instance , we can approximatively consider that each ion has a different discrete linear spectrum described by @xmath159 because homogeneous broading @xmath153 is much narrower than inhomogeneous broading .",
    "therefore , even single ions to be addressed individually in the case of not knowing the position of every ion . it may be used for addressing , or writing and reading data in future quantum computers .",
    "in conclusion , we have described a scheme to realize quantum computation in current laboratorial technique . compared with other schemes ,",
    "our scheme has the following significant advantages : ( a ) cpf gate between ions has very high fidelity and low error rate .",
    "routinely , in the worst case , @xmath160 and @xmath161 for @xmath82 are obtainable .",
    "( b ) simpler setup but good strong coupling conditions , and we need no measurement @xcite and shorter time delay .",
    "our delay time in total process is only @xmath3 while the time is at least @xmath162 in ref .",
    "( c ) our scheme is scalable because operation times @xmath163 can be expected about ten thousands , and most remarkably , microsphere cavities themselves tend to be scalable through fiber tapers or sparrows .",
    "it is stirring that every cavity - ion subsystem possibly represents a node in future quantum information and quantum computation while single - photon pulse mediates their interaction through fiber taper or sparrow technique .",
    "quantum computation based on our scheme is more applicable in lab with current experimental technique for we can operate single ions into microsphere cavities more controllably and accurately .",
