    "the study of the geometry of isolated complex singularities is an area with great advances in the last decades",
    ". a main result and starting point for this topic is milnor s fibration theorem ( see @xcite ) : let @xmath10 be a complex analytic germ , let @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a @xmath13-sphere centred at the origin , of radius @xmath14 sufficiently small .",
    "then the map @xmath15 is the projection of a @xmath16 locally trivial fibration .",
    "in fact , if the origin is an isolated singularity , @xmath17 induces an open - book decomposition of the sphere @xmath12 with binding @xmath18 and whose pages are the fibres of @xmath17 .    in @xcite ,",
    "j.  milnor shows that some real analytic germs also give rise to fibrations : let @xmath19 be real analytic and a submersion on a punctured neighbourhood @xmath20 of the origin in @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath18 ( defined as above ) be the link of the singularity and let @xmath22 be a small tubular neighbourhood of the link in the sphere @xmath23 . then there exists a @xmath16 locally trivial fibration @xmath24    the geometry of isolated real singularities has been less studied from this point of view essentially for two reasons :    the first one is that the hypothesis is very stringent ; for example , when @xmath25 , the set of critical points of @xmath26 is , in general , a curve .",
    "therefore it is not easy to find examples of real analytic germs satisfying such condition .",
    "the second reason is that even when a function @xmath26 satisfies this condition , in general it is not true that the projection @xmath27 can be given by @xmath28 as in the complex case .    despite these obstacles there",

    "see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "one of the main challenges is to find examples sufficiently controlled to give rise to a beautiful geometry ; _ i.e. _ , open - book decompositions ; but at the same time far from the complex context in order to get geometrical objects which can not be obtained from complex milnor fibrations .",
    "for example , consider the family of real analytic germs @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 with @xmath31 . by @xcite",

    "pichon and j.  seade prove that the link @xmath18 is isotopic to the link of the holomorphic germ @xmath33 , but the open - book decomposition given by the milnor fibration of @xmath26 is not equivalent to the one given by the milnor fibration of @xmath34 .",
    "in this paper we study the family of real germs @xmath0 given by @xmath1 with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath35 .",
    "we show that @xmath8 has an isolated singularity at the origin and the projection of the milnor fibration is given by @xmath36 , therefore it gives rise to an open - book decomposition of @xmath7 .",

    "alternatively , the same statement can be proved by noticing that for a compact complex surface @xmath54 , the invariant @xmath381 is 12-times the todd genus @xmath382 , which is a birational invariant , by hirzebruch - riemann - roch s theorem for compact complex surfaces .",
    "one can then compactify the surface @xmath360 by adding a divisor at infinity , whose singularities can be resolved , thus getting a smooth compactification @xmath383 of @xmath360 .",
    "the fact that the singularity is numerically gorenstein ensures that the todd genus @xmath384 splits in two parts : one of these is @xmath385 .",
    "the result then follows from the fact that @xmath384 remains constant under blowing ups .",
    "we finally remark that for singularities that are gorenstein and smoothable , the fact that @xmath385 does not depend on the choice of resolution is also a direct consequence of the laufer - steenbrink formula that we explain below , and the fact that the geometric genus is independent of the choice of resolution .",
    "the second statement in this theorem is now an immediate consequence of the previous statement , together with neumann s theorem ( * ? ?",
