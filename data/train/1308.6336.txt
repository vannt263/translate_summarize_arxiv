    "the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite shows that , for any quantum system of dimension @xmath1 or higher , the predictions of quantum theory ( qt ) can not be reproduced with any theory that assumes the measurement results to be predefined and independent of other compatible measurements , i.e. , noncontextual hidden variable ( nchv ) theories , @xcite .",
    "bell s theorem @xcite shows that , for entangled quantum states , the predictions of qt violate bell inequalities satisfied by any theory that assumes the results of local measurements to be independent of measurements on spatially separated parts .",
    "the proofs of both theorems are different . in the case of the ks theorem , the original proof consisted in a set of quantum yes - no tests , represented by rank-1 projectors , for which yes or no results can not be assigned satisfying that , for every set of jointly measurable projectors , one and only one of the projectors can have assigned the result yes .",
    "the proof works for any quantum state of the system . in the case of bell",
    "s theorem , the proof requires composite systems prepared in an entangled state and consists on the violation of a bell inequality .",
    "however , kernaghan and peres noticed that , for eight - dimensional quantum systems , there is a ks set of 40  yes - no quantum tests @xcite that is related @xcite to greenberger - horne - zeilinger s ( ghz ) proof of bell s theorem without inequalities @xcite , which can be reformulated as a violation of mermin s bell inequality @xcite ( which has been experimentally tested in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    every bell inequality can be converted into a noncontextuality ( nc ) inequality ( i.e. , one satisfied by any nchv theory ) involving sequential measurements ( of compatible observables ) on a single system rather than spacelike separated measurements ( of compatible observables ) on a composite system , and preserving both the compatibility relations existing in the bell scenario and the maximum quantum violation . to see this , recall that two observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 are compatible if there exists an observable @xmath4 whose outcome set is the cartesian product of the outcome sets of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and such that , for all states , the outcome probability distributions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are recovered as marginals of the outcome probability distribution of @xmath4 .",
    "if some observables are compatible then there exists a joint probability distribution for them . in scenarios where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are measured on separated systems , as in bell inequality scenarios",
    ", constructing @xmath4 is immediate once one has local devices for measuring @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in scenarios where arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath3 are measured on the same system the problem is not so simple @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are sharp quantum observables ( i.e. , quantum observables in von neumann s sense @xcite ) , qt provides a prescription to build a measurement device for each of them @xcite .",
    "then , a device for @xmath4 is simply one consisting of the devices for @xmath2 and @xmath3 placed sequentially in any order @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to observe that , for different states , the violations of a nc inequality derived from mermin s bell inequality coincide with those predicted by qt for an experiment with spacelike measurements .",
    "then , we experimentally show that this experiment is connected with kernaghan and peres s ks set .    for that ,",
    "we start by experimentally implementing kernaghan and peres s ks set of tests using eight - dimensional quantum systems encoded in the transverse momentum of single photons , and observe the state - independent quantum violation of a noncontextuality inequality associated to the 40  ks tests .",
    "then , we show that , if the system is prepared in a quantum state that is a single - system version of a ghz state or in a state that is a single - system version of a @xmath0 state , the results of a subset of 16  ks tests violate a nc inequality which is formally equivalent to mermin s bell inequality , but for single eight - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "moreover , for both states , the experimental violations of the nc inequality are in agreement with those predicted by qt for experiments with spacelike separated measurements .    in the sense explained before , our results provide _ experimental _ evidence of the connection between bell and ks theorems and support the conclusion that quantum nonlocality , and its limits , are actually given by quantum contextuality and its limits .",
    "this may pave the way towards a deeper understanding of qt .",
    "the ks set introduced by kernaghan and peres @xcite has 40  eight - dimensional vectors .",
    "two yes - no tests that can not both give result  @xmath5 ( corresponding to `` yes '' ; result  @xmath6 corresponds to `` no '' ) are represented by orthogonal vectors .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows these 40  vectors .",
    "the relations of orthogonality between the 40  vectors are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,<,^,^,<,^,^,<,^,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     now , when we prepare an eight - dimensional system in one specific vector of the ks set , that is , an initial state for which the first ks test gives result  1 ( the ghz state ) , and perform the projections for the 16  ks tests in the nc mermin inequality , we obtain that @xmath7 maximally violating nc inequality ( [ merm_ineq ] ) .",
    "the observation of such a violation constitutes an experimental observation that there is a connection between quantum contextuality and nonlocality for systems of dimension  @xmath8 .",
    "this is due to the aforementioned relation between inequalities ( [ ineks40 ] ) , ( [ mermin_ini ] ) , and ( [ merm_ineq ] ) .",
    "here it is important to clarify that the advantage of performing the tests of inequalities ( [ ineks40 ] ) and ( [ merm_ineq ] ) with tripartite entangled states is that a single experiment can refute lhv and nchv theories , simultaneously .",
    "however , as we show in the next section , single eight - dimensional systems suffice for observing the connection between the ks and ghz theorems .",
    "in our experiment , the eight - dimensional quantum states are encoded in the linear transverse momentum of single photons transmitted by diffractive apertures addressed in spatial light modulators ( slms ) @xcite .",
    "the dimension of the quantum states is defined by the number of paths available for the photon transmission @xcite . in our case",
    ", we have an aperture composed of eight parallel slits , and the state of the transmitted photons is given by @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the state of a photon transmitted by the @xmath11th - slit @xcite .",
    "@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the transmissivity ( phase ) defined for each slit , and @xmath14 is the normalization constant .    ) and ( [ merm_ineq ] ) after performing , on each of them , the 40  ks vector projections .",
    "the ks projections are carried out using slm3 , slm4 and a point - like apd ( see the main text for details ) .",
    "[ fig2],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the experimental setup is depicted in fig .",
    "a single - mode continuous - wave ( cw ) laser operating at @xmath15 nm is combined with an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to produce attenuated optical pulses with a mean photon number of @xmath16 .",
    "the first two slms , slm1 and slm2 , are used to prepare the initial state , @xmath17 .",
    "slm1 ( slm2 ) displays an amplitude ( phase ) mask of eight slits with the gray level of the used pixels properly set for the generation of the desired initial state .",
    "the slits are 2 pixels wide , with a separation of 1 pixel between them , where each pixel is a square with a side length of @xmath18 @xmath19 m .",
    "the projections onto the vectors of the ks set are carried out using a second pair of slms , slm3 and slm4 , and a point - like avalanche photo - detector ( apd ) .",
    "the masks of these last modulators have the same dimension as the ones used by slm1 and slm2 .",
    "the only difference between them is that of the gray levels used , now set according to the amplitudes and phases of the 40  ks vectors . after the slm4",
    ", the attenuated laser beam is focused at the detection plane .",
    "the point - like detector is constructed using a pinhole in front of a conventional bulk apd , which is then positioned at the center of the interference pattern . in this configuration , the probability of single - photon detection at the apd is proportional to @xmath20 @xcite .    during the implementation of the ks tests ,",
    "the modulations performed by slm1 and slm2 remain fixed producing the quantum state to be used in the test .",
    "the aom , slm3 , slm4 , and apd are connected to a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) electronics unit , which synchronizes the optical pulse generation , the masks displayed in both slms , and the detection time of the apd .",
    "this synchronization allows us to project , for each optical pulse , the prepared state into a different ks vector . the projection is randomly chosen by using a true random number generator ( rng ) connected to the fpga . for each initial state",
    "considered , the setup automatically runs for 17  h ( with more than @xmath21 detected pulses ) in order to minimize statistical fluctuations and unambiguously certify its quantum behavior ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "state - independent quantum contextuality is observed through the violation of inequality ( [ ineks40 ] ) for five different types of initial quantum states .",
    "namely , a ghz state [ @xmath22 @xcite , a @xmath0 state [ @xmath23 @xcite , a state that is equivalent to a product of a two - qubit maximally entangled state and a pure state of one qubit [ @xmath24 , a state equivalent to a product of a two - qubit partially entangled state and a pure state of one qubit [ @xmath25 , and a product state [ @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare the theoretical and the experimental results for all the 40  projection probabilities appearing in @xmath27 when the initial state of the system is the ghz state .",
    "the similarity , @xmath28 , of the recorded and theoretical probability distributions reaches @xmath29 @xcite ( see appendix  [ appendixb ] for details of the other four initial states ) .",
    "when the initial state is the ghz state .",
    "the 40  ks tests are grouped in five bases , as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions for an ideal experiment are shown in the upper right corner .",
    "@xmath28 is the similarity of the recorded and theoretical probability distributions .",
    "[ fig3],scaledwidth=36.0% ]    due to intrinsic experimental imperfections in real experiments , the mean values of the recorded probabilities that were supposed to be null , in an ideal experiment , do not vanish .",
    "thus , it is necessary to modify the noncontextual limit of inequality ( [ ineks40 ] ) to proper demonstrate quantum contextuality . in this work",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite .",
    "the idea is simple : first one takes from the experimental data the mean value of the recorded probabilities that were supposed to be null ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) . to measure it",
    ", one needs to perform the so - called exclusivity tests , where one of the ks vectors is used as the initial state and the remaining orthogonal measurements are performed . to properly estimate the value of @xmath30",
    ", we have performed a total of 184 exclusivity tests and obtained that @xmath31 ( see appendix  [ appendixc ] for some examples of the exclusivity tests performed ) .",
    "then , since the inequality @xcite involves a sum of all the ks vector projection probabilities , one has a noncontextual upper bound given by @xmath32 , where the noncontextual limit of @xmath33 is achieved with probability @xmath34 , and all the 40  ks tests give false positive results with probability @xmath30 . in our case , @xmath35 .",
    "the results obtained for the five initial states considered are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "all of them clearly violate the noncontextual limit , demonstrating the impossibility of non - contextual hidden variables models explaining our results .",
    "the quantum limit when errors are taken into account is similarly obtained @xcite .    .",
    "the dotted line `` noncontextual limit ( ideal ) '' indicates the maximum possible value of @xmath27 for noncontextual hidden variable theories in an ideal experiment in which the exclusivity relations between the ks tests are perfect .",
    "the dotted line `` noncontextual limit '' indicates the value when experimental imperfections are taken into account , and similarly for the quantum limits .",
    "( b ) experimental results for @xmath36 .",
    "the measured violations for the ghz and @xmath0 states are within the theoretical predictions for an ideal experiment , namely , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "[ fig4],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for the ghz @xcite and the @xmath0 @xcite states we also record the corresponding violation of the noncontextual limit of the nc mermin inequality .",
    "the obtained violations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . for the ghz state the measured value was @xmath39 . for the @xmath40 state ,",
    "the violation was @xmath41 . in the case of the ghz state",
    ", the observed violation demonstrates that , if the answer to one of the ks tests is positive , no noncontextual hidden variable model can explain the obtained results of the 16  ks tests in the nc mermin inequality .",
    "notice that our experiment is a test of a nc inequality formally equivalent to a bell inequality in the sense of previous tests on single systems @xcite .",
    "it is for this reason that the noncontextual limit of inequality ( [ merm_ineq ] ) must be modified to take errors into account , using the same argument used to correct the noncontextual limit of inequality ( [ ineks40 ] ) . in our case",
    ", the experimental value , @xmath42 , modifies the noncontextual limit to @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig4](b ) shows that the experimental results violate this limit .",
    "recent experiments have shown that ks sets of quantum tests can be used to experimentally reveal quantum state - independent contextuality for quantum systems of a given dimension .",
    "previous experiments have shown this for quantum systems of dimension 3 @xcite and 4 @xcite .",
    "here we have implemented a ks set in dimension 8 and shown how to use it to reveal eight - dimensional quantum state - independent contextuality through the violation of a nc inequality .",
    "the ks set we have implemented is particularly important because it connects ks and ghz proofs of no hidden variables .",
    "specifically , ghz s proof can be seen as a state - dependent version of the proof of the ks theorem .",
    "here we have experimentally shown this connection by preparing eight - dimensional single systems in a state that is formally equivalent to a ghz state , and observing a violation of a nc inequality that is a single - system version of mermin s inequality .",
