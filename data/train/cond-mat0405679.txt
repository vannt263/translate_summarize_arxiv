    "the filled skutterudite compound pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 has proven to be an intriguing and unusual material since its discovery as the first pr - based heavy fermion superconductor a few years ago . @xcite",
    "both the heavy fermion ( @xmath16 ) and the superconducting ( @xmath17 k ) states display very unusual properties .",
    "the ground state of the pr@xmath18 ion in pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 that arises from the splitting of the pr@xmath19 multiplet in a crystalline electric field ( cef ) is nonmagnetic , and is either a @xmath20 singlet or a @xmath21 doublet .",
    "the @xmath22 triplet first excited state is @xmath23 k above the ground state , with the other excited states following at @xmath24 k ( @xmath25 triplet ) and @xmath26 k ( @xmath21 or @xmath20 , respectively ) . in the superconducting state ,",
    "pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 exhibits multiple transitions in specific heat @xcite and magnetic penetration depth,@xcite and may also contain multiple superconducting phases.@xcite the nature of the superconducting energy gap is also not clear : muon spin rotation @xcite ( @xmath27sr ) and sb - nuclear quadrupole resonance @xcite ( sb - nqr ) measurements indicate isotropic and strong - coupling superconductivity , tunneling spectroscopy measurements support a nearly fully gapped but unconventional superconducting order parameter,@xcite and data from thermal conductivity in a magnetic field@xcite and magnetic penetration depth@xcite are consistent with point nodes in the energy gap .",
    "additional @xmath27sr measurements reveal possible time - reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state , further suggesting that the superconducting state does not have s - wave symmetry.@xcite    prru@xmath3sb@xmath4 is a much simpler compound than pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 .",
    "it is also superconducting ( @xmath28 k ) , but displays more conventional properties.@xcite from sb - nqr measurements , the superconductivity appears to be weak - coupling with an isotropic energy gap.@xcite magnetic penetration depth measurements yield moderate coupling and a fully gapped order parameter.@xcite in addition , prru@xmath3sb@xmath4 is not a heavy fermion compound ; it has an electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath29 times smaller than that of pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 .",
    "features in the physical properties of prru@xmath3sb@xmath4 could be described by a cef model with a @xmath20 ground state and a @xmath25 first excited state separated by @xmath30 k.@xcite    the pr(os@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3sb@xmath4 series of compounds was previously studied through measurements of magnetic susceptibility @xmath31 and electrical resistivity @xmath32.@xcite superconductivity was found to persist for all values of the ru concentration @xmath6 , with a minimum in the @xmath33 phase diagram at @xmath34 where @xmath35 k. this minimum may arise from a competition between the heavy fermion superconductivity of pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 ( @xmath36 ) and the bcs superconductivity of prru@xmath3sb@xmath4 ( @xmath37 ) . based on theoretical models , it has recently been suggested that there may be a mixed - parity superconducting state near this minimum in @xmath7.@xcite cef effects were also observed for all values of @xmath6 in the normal state of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with the splitting between the ground state and the first excited state increasing monotonically with @xmath6 between @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for @xmath31 , fits with a @xmath21 ground state were consistent with the data for all values of @xmath6 , while fits with a @xmath20 ground state were only satisfactory near the extremal values of the pr(os@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3sb@xmath4 series .",
    "the @xmath32 data were also fit with cef equations , and although the fits were insensitive to the degeneracy of the ground state , they were still able to provide level splittings consistent with those derived from the @xmath31 data .",
    "in the present study , the specific heat @xmath0 of pr(os@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3sb@xmath4 was measured down to @xmath38 k , to further investigate the normal and superconducting state properties of this extraordinary system .",
    "the single crystal specimens of pr(os@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3sb@xmath4 investigated in this work were identical to those previously studied.@xcite specific heat @xmath39 was measured as a function of temperature between @xmath5 and @xmath40 k in a @xmath41he semiadiabatic calorimeter by using a standard heat pulse technique .",
    "the samples were attached to a sapphire platform with apiezon n grease .",
    "the data presented in this work were taken from experiments on collections of single crystals with total masses between @xmath42 and @xmath43 mg .",
    "x - ray measurements show no signs of multiple phases in the doped materials ; however , there was some sample dependence of the superconducting transition in electrical resistivity , especially on the doped materials.@xcite thus , the @xmath0 data , especially at the superconducting transitions , are expected to be slightly broadened by the sample dependence of the crystals .",
    "displayed in fig .",

    "all of the @xmath0 data for pr(os@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3sb@xmath4 were fitted between their superconducting transitions @xmath7 and @xmath47 k by an equation including electronic , lattice , and schottky terms : @xmath48 here @xmath11 is the electronic specific heat coefficient , @xmath49 is the lattice specific heat coefficient ( where @xmath50 is the debye temperature ) , and @xmath51 is the schottky specific heat anomaly for a two level system arising from the energy difference between the cef ground state and the first excited state , scaled by a factor @xmath52 .",
    "the results of these fits are listed in table [ ceftable ] .",
    "these fits find values of @xmath50 for the end member compounds comparable to other single crystal results of @xmath53 k for pros@xmath3sb@xmath4@xcite and @xmath54 k for prru@xmath3sb@xmath4.@xcite    the schottky specific heat anomaly @xmath55 for a two - level system is given by @xmath56^{2 } } , \\label{csch}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the energy difference in units of k between the two levels , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the degeneracies of the ground state and excited state , respectively.@xcite in zero magnetic field , this equation is independent of whether or not the local symmmetry of the pr@xmath18 ions is cubic or tetrahedral .",
    "it was found during the fitting procedure that in order for the fits to be accurate , one or more of the terms in eq .",
    "[ ctotal ] had to be scaled .",
    "fits were done both with @xmath52 modifying the schottky term , and with @xmath52 multiplying the entire equation .",
    "the former case would be interpreted as some internal broadening of the energy levels or as an overall transfer of entropy to the itinerant electrons due to hybridization , while the latter case would imply impurity phases ( most likely free sb ) causing an overall overestimate of the sample mass . while both possibilities produced good qualitative fits ,",
    "the values for @xmath11 resulting from assuming an overall scaling were extremely large and not physically reasonable .",
    "therefore , all the fits presented here were exactly as shown in eq .",
    "[ ctotal ] , with @xmath52 only modifying the schottky anomaly term .",
    "the normal state fits were only performed up to @xmath47 k so that the @xmath60 approximation would more likely be accurate ; however , the lattice terms are clearly the smallest in this temperature range compared to the other terms , and are thus difficult to accurately fit .",
    "this appears to especially be true for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath50 is suppressed compared to the end member compounds , and which may be due to the disorder inherent in the substituted compounds .",
    "because of the uncertainty in the accuracy of the fit values for @xmath50 , the error in the other parameters was estimated by varying @xmath50 by @xmath63 and refitting the data .",
    "the largest error in the normal state arises in @xmath11 , while the errors in @xmath57 and @xmath52 are much smaller .",
    "these errors are represented in table [ ceftable ] and in the figures where appropriate .    the question of whether or not the ground state in pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 is a @xmath21 doublet or a @xmath20 singlet has been contentious since the heavy fermion superconductivity of pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 was discovered . in our original reports of heavy fermion superconductivity in pros@xmath3sb@xmath4,@xcite fits to the magnetic susceptibility yielded two possible pr@xmath18 crystalline electric field splittings , both with a @xmath22 first excited state and either a @xmath20 singlet ground state or a @xmath21 nonmagnetic doublet ground state with a quadrupole moment . at the present time",
    ", it appears that the overall data are better explained by a @xmath20 singlet ground state.@xcite nevertheless , it was felt that fits to the @xmath0 data for both possibilities should be made . as can be seen from table [ ceftable ] and fig.[diagrams](b ) , when fitting the normal state data up to @xmath47 k , both possible ground state fits result in reasonable values that agree well with those previously published for pr(os@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3sb@xmath4 based on @xmath31 and @xmath32 measurements.@xcite however , for @xmath64 , the scaling factor @xmath52 is much closer to @xmath65 for a @xmath21 ground state compared to @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the best @xmath21 ground state fit for @xmath36 , pure pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , results in almost no scaling whatsoever .",
    "( the present fits were performed on data from a measurement of single crystals , while some previously published fits were performed on data from a measurement of a pressed pellet.@xcite ) these results of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath9 are very consistent with fits performed on data from measurements of single crystals by vollmer _",
    "et al . _ , which resulted in the values @xmath68 and @xmath69.@xcite as @xmath6 increases , the scaling factor decreases , indicating a suppression of the schottky anomaly . at face value",
    ", the fact that @xmath70 is always closer to @xmath65 than @xmath71 for @xmath64 could be considered as support for a @xmath21 ground state .",
    "it has been suggested that the suppression of the schottky anomaly , especially for a @xmath20 ground state fit for pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , could result from an energy dispersion due to pr - pr interactions@xcite or hybridization between the pr f - electrons and ligand states.@xcite as these arguments can apply equally well to either ground state , these normal state results for @xmath72 appear unable to discern between @xmath20 and @xmath21 ground states .",
    "for @xmath73 , the scaling factor @xmath52 increases rapidly .",
    "prru@xmath3sb@xmath4 exhibits a situation complementary to that of pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 : while @xmath70 is still @xmath74 times larger than @xmath71 , it is @xmath71 that is closer to @xmath65 .",
    "the accuracy of these results could be affected by the temperature limits of the fits ; for these large splittings , the maximum of the schottky anomaly is well above @xmath47 k. however , the calculated values of @xmath57 for the different ground states agree very well overall with the values previously measured,@xcite supporting the monotonic increase of the splitting between the ground state and the first excited state throughout the pr(os@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3sb@xmath4 series ( fig .  [ diagrams](b ) ) .    in order to get a more accurate determination of @xmath7 and the specific heat jump at @xmath7 , @xmath14 , the cef and lattice fit results were subtracted from the data at low temperatures , leaving only the electronic specific heat .",
    "the subtractions were carried out using both the @xmath21 and the @xmath20 ground state cef fits , including those due to the variation of @xmath50 in order to further estimate the error of the parameters .",
    "all the subtractions resulted in exactly the same @xmath7 values , and very similar ( within experimental error ) @xmath14 values , which are both listed in table [ sctable ] .",
    "these values of @xmath7 are plotted as a function of @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ diagrams](a ) , along with previously measured values ; the error bars for the @xmath7 points represent the width of the transitions in the respective measurements .",
    "all the data agree very well , and the minimum at @xmath8 is also reproduced in the current data . with the exception of pure pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 ( i.e. , for @xmath75 ) ,",
    "the shapes of the measured @xmath0 curves below @xmath7 were nearly the same for either @xmath20 or @xmath21-based subtraction .",
    "however , for pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , a significant difference can be seen in the slope of the data below @xmath7 for the two different subtractions .",
    "the @xmath0 data after subtraction of @xmath76 and @xmath55 for a @xmath20 or @xmath21 ground state , @xmath77 , are shown in fig .",
    "all the concentrations are shown for the @xmath20 ground state subtraction , and the @xmath21 ground state subtraction is also shown for @xmath9 .    the data below @xmath7 , after the lattice and cef terms were subtracted , were fit to both power - law and exponential functions , for energy gaps with and without nodes , respectively .",
    "these functions are typically considered to be valid only at very low temperatures .",
    "however , there are several examples of heavy fermion superconductors which appear to display power - law behavior up to near @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the current experiment had a low - temperature limit of @xmath5 k , which is effectively a base temperature due to the large nuclear schottky contribution at lower temperatures.@xcite the high temperature limit of the fit was chosen to be @xmath78 in light of the above referenced examples , and also to avoid possible spurious effects due to the width of the superconducting transitions .",
    "because of these constraints , only the samples with @xmath79 could be fitted below @xmath7 , as there were not enough data points at the other concentrations to give a reliable fit .",
    "the power - law fit was of the form @xmath80 suggested for energy gaps containing nodes,@xcite and the exponential fit was of the bcs form@xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents an electronic specific heat coefficient in the superconducting state , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are fitting constants , and @xmath85 is proportional to the energy gap in the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "the results of the application of these fits to the @xmath9 and @xmath15 data , for both ground state subtractions , are shown in fig .",
    "[ sccompare ] , where the solid lines correspond to the power law fits and the dashed lines represent the exponential fits . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the power - law fits extrapolate from the highest fit temperature of @xmath86 k all the way up to the transition , while the exponential fits deviate from the data right above @xmath87 k. for @xmath88 and higher , the converse is true , as the exponential fits extrapolate to the higher temperature data ( above @xmath89 k for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and above @xmath92 k for @xmath93 ) much more accurately than the power law fits . while these extrapolations can not be taken by themselves as proof of the superiority of one fit over the other , they are certainly suggestive and intriguing .",
    "the broadened superconducting transitions in the ru - doped samples in particular may make the exponential fit appear more appropriate .    the constants from the fits below @xmath7 are also listed in table [ sctable ] .",
    "the listed errors are due to the variation of @xmath50 in the normal state fits .",
    "the error in @xmath7 was taken to be the width of the superconducting transition and is presented graphically in fig .",
    "[ diagrams]a ; the error in @xmath14 from the variation of @xmath50 was negligibly small compared to the error inherent in the equal area construction for determining @xmath14 , which is represented graphically in fig .",
    "[ gamma ] .",
    "since these fits are phenomenological , the absolute values of the resulting parameters should not necessarily be trusted .",
    "however , comparing the fits and the samples to one another can prove instructive . for pure pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , the @xmath21 ground state subtraction results in fits that are much different from the @xmath20 ground state subtraction results .",
    "the other concentrations have similar fit parameters for the two different ground states .",
    "in addition , the values for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath85 , and the errors associated with them , are much larger for the @xmath96 fits than for the other @xmath21 fits , falling well outside the spread of the other three data points . if the fits are indeed accurate , then the value of @xmath95 for the @xmath97 data is comparable with the @xmath98 expected in @xmath44 for a heavy fermion compound with point nodes in the energy gap.@xcite the values of @xmath85 for the @xmath20 data of @xmath99 are moderately enhanced compared to the weak - coupling value of @xmath100 ( for @xmath85 in units of k ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 can be interpreted as a portion of the sample that is normal or gapless ; however , the values of @xmath82 could also simply be artifacts of the fit , especially in the case of the power law fit for @xmath101 .",
    "the large discrepancy between the fits below @xmath7 for pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , even if the absolute values are not entirely accurate , do lend phenomenological support for @xmath20 being the ground state in this compound .",
    "it is interesting that the analysis of @xmath0 in the superconducting state for samples containing a small amount of ru shows only small sensitivity to the choice of @xmath20 or @xmath21 for the pr@xmath18 ground state .",
    "[ gamma ] shows a comparison between the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath11 calculated from the fits of the normal state @xmath44 data and a value estimated from @xmath102 . in the bcs theory of superconductivity , @xmath103",
    "this is not likely to be true in the case of the unconventional superconductivity in pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 .",
    "however , it is expected that there will be some proportional relation between @xmath14 and @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xmath104 ) , and so it can still be instructive to view this graphically .",
    "it can be seen in table [ sctable ] and fig.[gamma ] that @xmath105 derived from the normal state fits exhibits a peak at @xmath15 , decreases with @xmath6 to a minimum at @xmath8 , and then slowly rises with @xmath6 to @xmath106 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath14 starts out extremely large for @xmath9 and decreases very quickly , again to a minimum value at @xmath8 .",
    "the `` hump '' in the data at @xmath62 is due to the extremely broad superconducting transition at this concentration .",
    "the discrepancy between the values of @xmath11 determined from the normal state data and calculated from the superconducting transition is an interesting one .",
    "the minimum in @xmath11 at @xmath8 for the measured @xmath11 , along with the minimum in @xmath7 , strongly suggests that something unusual is happening with the physical properties at this concentration .",
    "in contrast , the enhanced @xmath14 for @xmath9 and @xmath15 imply that strong - coupling superconductivity is only present for these two concentrations .",
    "taken at face value , this could mean that for @xmath107 , the heavy electrons are _ not _ participating in the superconductivity , which would imply that the superconductivity is nearly conventional for @xmath108 ( and possibly also for @xmath15 if the exponential behavior below @xmath7 is appropriate ) .",
    "a more conventional explanation could be that the ru substitution broadens the superconducting transitions in @xmath0 enough to result in an underestimate for @xmath102 .",
    "this would only appear to be the case for @xmath109 , however , as the superconducting transitions for @xmath8 and @xmath110 are as sharp or sharper than for @xmath106 .",
    "it would be unusual for disorder to play a strong role only for low ru concentrations .    in figs .",
    "[ csc ] and [ sccompare ] it can be seen that the sharp double superconducting transition present in pure pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 is not obviously apparent in the ru - doped samples , although this may be obscured by the width of the transitions .",
    "_ have recently suggested that this double transition may arise from two superconducting phases which react differently to ru substitution ; i.e. , one is unconventional and is quickly destroyed by impurities , while the other is more conventional and persists throughout the entire series.@xcite it will be interesting to see whether or not this conjecture can tie together the seemingly contradictory results obtained through experiments over the past few years .",
    "indeed , in studies on the specific heat of la - doped pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , preliminary results suggest that only the lower transition of pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 is suppressed for small la concentrations.@xcite this could also be the case for the present ru substitution studies . on the other hand , measurements of magnetic penetration depth suggest two - band superconductivity in pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , where the two bands are coupled by josephson pair tunnelling , which requires the two order parameters to have the same symmetry.@xcite the difference in the behavior below @xmath7 between pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 and the ru - doped samples could perhaps be accounted for by the suppression of one of the superconducting bands .",
    "measurements on samples with small ru concentrations are underway in order to more closely track the evolution of the superconducting properties in this remarkable series of compounds .",
    "the specific heat of single crystal samples of pr(os@xmath1ru@xmath2)@xmath3sb@xmath4 was measured down to @xmath5 k. fits to the normal state data resulted in cef parameters that monotonically increase with @xmath6 , in agreement with previously reported data .",
    "the superconducting transitions in @xmath0 were also consistent with previously reported @xmath31 and @xmath32 data , confirming the minimum in @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "below @xmath7 , a power law fit possibly corresponding to point nodes in the energy gap could better describe the data for pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , but an exponential fit associated with an isotropic energy gap was more appropriate for the data with @xmath10 .",
    "the electronic specific heat @xmath11 was inferred from both normal state data and the ratio @xmath102 .",
    "the normal state fits revealed an enhanced @xmath11 for @xmath64 , reaching a minimum value at @xmath8 , the same concentration as the minimum in @xmath7 .",
