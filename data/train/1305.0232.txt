    "knowledge of radiation fields ( rf ) in galaxies is of prime importance to many branches of astrophysics , embracing low- and high - energy processes in the interstellar and intergalactic medium , with applications to cosmology , galactic astrophysics , astro - chemistry and astro - biology .",
    "for example ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation fields are one of the most important heating agents for interstellar gas , proceeding either through photoionisation in the presence of ionising uv radiation , or through the photoelectric effect in the neutral ism .",
    "thus , the main cooling lines of the interstellar medium , in particular the [ cii ] line , are produced as a result of the photoelectric effect on dust grains , primary driven by non - ionising uv photons from the ambient radiation fields interacting with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules and dust grains , both in star - formation regions ( e.g. crawford et al .",
    "1985 , tielens & hollenbach 1985 , wolfire et al . 1989 , hollenbach 1991 , israel & maloney 2011 ) and in the diffuse ism ( e.g. madden et al .",

    "2009 , lebouteiller et al .",
    "diffuse rfs impinging on molecular clouds in the interstellar medium also drive the excitation of molecules in the outer layers of the clouds , determining the rotational - line emission from rare tracers such as co molecules , from which the bulk of the mass in the form of molecular hydrogen can be determined .",
    "a quantitative knowledge of the amplitude and spectrum of the rfs is also a necessary input for hydro - dynamical simulations of the turbulent structure of the interstellar medium ( e.g. de avillez & breitschwert 2007 ) .    in high - energy astrophysics",
    "it is particularly important to know the number density of all photons , including those of low energies where the number density is high , because such photons can be transformed into gamma - rays through the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) with relativistic electrons . indeed ,",
    "inverse compton scattering provides one of the principal @xmath0-ray production mechanisms ( jones 1968 , blumenthal & gould 1970 , aharonian & atoyan 1981 , narginen & putanen 1993 , brunetti 2000 , sazonov & sunyaev 2000 ) . in a variety of astrophysics environments , from very compact objects like pulsars and active galactic nuclei to extended sources like supernova remnants and clusters of galaxies , low - energy photons are efficiently boosted to high energies through this mechanism ( aharonian & ambartsumyan 1985 , zdziarski et al .",

    "2006 , 2010 ) . in galaxies the uv / optical and far - infrared ( fir )",
    "interstellar radiation fields can be an important channel for the production of inverse compton @xmath0-rays .",
    "thus , knowledge of the interstellar rfs is needed to measure the distribution of relativistic electrons in these objects , as well as to isolate other gamma - ray emissions , such as those produced in the decay of pions generated in the interaction of relativistic protons with interstellar gas .",
    "similarly , because relativistic electrons also produce radio synchrotron emission , knowledge of the rf in galaxies is necessary to elucidate the strength of interstellar magnetic fields from a combination of radio and gamma - ray observations .",
    "radiation fields also affect the propagation of gamma - rays through the intergalactic medium ( e.g. stecker et al .",
    "1992 ) as well as even in the interstellar medium ( moskalenko et al .",
    "2006 ) through pair production of gamma - ray photons on the background radiation fields .    in summary",
    "it is clear that the observational signatures of many of the most fundamental physical attributes of galaxies , including the mass of interstellar gas , in both atomic and molecular form , the thermodynamical properties of this gas , as well as the ambient magnetic fields and cosmic rays in the form of both protons and nuclei and electrons , depend on the radiation fields in galaxies .",
    "it would be relatively straightforward to determine radiation fields by direct observations of the sources of photons , which , in most cases , are predominantly stars , if galaxies were optically thin .",
    "however , galaxies - and in particular star - forming galaxies - contain dust , which , because it absorbs and scatters photons , partially or wholly prevents a direct measurement of the spatial and spectral distribution of the sources of the rfs .",
    "the propagation of light depends in a complex way on the relative distribution of stellar emissivity and dust opacity , with structures ranging in scale from parsecs to kiloparsecs .",
    "fortunately , although dust is the cause of this problem , it is also part of the solution , because the absorbed light is re - radiated in the mid - infrared ( mir)/fir / submillimeter ( submm ) . in particular grains which are sufficiently large to be in equilibrium with the radiation fields directly probe the strength of these radiation fields , acting as a strong constraint on the radiation transfer problem .",
    "in addition , the radiation emitted by grains small enough to be impulsively heated by individual photons strongly depends on the colour of these photons , placing particular constraints on the uv component of the interstellar radiation fields , providing one has independent knowledge of the size distributions of the constituent populations of grains .",
    "thus , the key to determining radiation fields in galaxies is to invert the observed broad - band spectral energy distribution incorporating both measurements of direct light in the ultraviolet ( uv)/optical , as well as the dust re - radiated light in the far - infrared ( fir)/submillimeter ( submm ) , self - consistently taking into account constraints on the spatial distribution of both stars and dust as well as on the optical properties of the grains .",
    "this is the only way in which the exact contribution of optical and uv photons in heating dust grains can be traced , allowing for a proper determination of the contribution of old and young stellar populations in heating the dust ( popescu & tuffs 2010 ) , and therefore allowing for a consistent estimation of the star - formation rates in galaxies , and , ultimately for a robust determination of their star - formation history .",

    "the solutions are given in the form of a library of stellar radiation fields for the main morphological components of our model of spiral galaxies : disks , thin disks and bulges .",
    "these radiation fields are identical to those used when calculating the library of panchromatic seds presented in popescu et al .",
    "because of this observables calculated from the radiation fields , such as gamma - ray or radio emission , can be self - consistently combined with the solutions for the uv / optical / submm seds found using popescu et al .",

    "accordingly , the library of radiation fields is calculated for different values of central face - on dust opacity , as defined in popescu et al .",
    "the separate tabulation of the radiation fields for disks , thin disks and bulges is possible because all the stellar components are attenuated by the same distribution of dust , and therefore the diffuse radiation fields seen by each grain can be considered to be a sum of the radiation fields produced by each stellar component .",

    "radiation fields in dust re - emission will be the object of a future paper , as these can not be separated according to the different stellar components heating the dust , nor have they additive properties .",
    "this is because there is no linear transformation between dust emission and absorption .",

    "the details of the calculations leading to the production of the the radiation fields are described at length in popescu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . here",
    "we only briefly mention their main characteristics .",
    "all calculations were made using a modified version of the ray - tracing radiative transfer code of @xcite , which treats scattering utilising the method of scattered intensities ( kylafis & xilouris 2005 ) , and the dust model from weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) and draine & li ( 2007 ) , incorporating a mixture of silicates , graphites and pah molecules .",
    "the radiation fields are calculated separately for the old stellar disk ( `` the disk '' ) , the bulge and the young stellar disk (  the thin disk ) of a galaxy , all seen through a common distribution of dust .",
    "the geometrical model of popescu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) consists of both of a large - scale distribution of diffuse dust and stars , as well as of a clumpy component physically associated with the star - forming complexes .",
    "for the purpose of this study only the large - scale distribution of diffuse dust is considered , as it is this that affects the large - scale distribution of uv / optical light determining the values of the diffuse radiation fields .",
    "the intrinsic volume stellar distributions are described by exponential functions in both radial and vertical direction for the two stellar disks and by deprojected de vaucouleurs or srsic functions for the bulges .",
    "the diffuse dust is distributed in two disks associated with the old and young stellar populations , which we refer to as the thick and thin dust disk , respectively , on account of the different thickness of these structures .",
    "these dust distributions are described by double ( radial and vertical ) exponential functions .",
    "the thick dust disk is less opaque than the thin dust disk , with the relative face - on central dust opacity being fixed to a value of 0.387 .",
    "the length parameters of the model describing the volume emissivity for stars and dust - scale - lengths , scale - heights and effective radii - are listed in table  1 in tuffs et al .",
    "the relevant information for this work is that the old stellar disk component has a scale - length that decreases with increasing optical / nir wavelength , as given in table  2 in tuffs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , while the scale - height remains constant over this wavelength range .",
    "similarly , the effective radius of the bulge does not vary with optical / nir wavelength .",
    "the bulge is an oblate ellipsoid with an axial ratio ( thickness ) of 0.6 .",
    "the young stellar disk has a much smaller scale - height than the older stellar disk ( by a factor of 4.6 ) , while its scale - length is constant over wavelength and is equal to that of the old stellar disk in the b band .",
    "the scale - length of the thick dust disk associated with the old stellar population is larger ( by a factor of 1.4 ) than that of the corresponding stellar disk , while its scale - height is smaller ( by a factor of 1.5 ) than the scale - height of the old stellar disk .",
    "in contrast , the young stellar disk spatially coincides with the associated thin dust disk ( same scale - heights and -lengths ) . as we will see in the next sections ,",
    "the different vertical structure of the two dust disks strongly influences the solution for the radiation fields .",
    "the stellar and dust emissivities of the disks are truncated at a radius of 4.78 of the exponential stellar scale - length in b - band while bulges are truncated at ten effective radii .",
    "the geometrical parameters of the model have either been empirically constrained to follow the median trends found by xilouris et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a sample of well resolved edge - on spiral galaxies , including ngc891 , or have been fixed from physical considerations .",
    "the physical interpretation of this model is described at length in tuffs et al .",

    "a schematic representation of the geometrical model can be found in fig .  1 in popescu et al .",

    "the radiation fields are sampled on an irregular grid with sampling intervals in radial direction ranging from 50pc in the centre to up to 2kpc in the outer disk and with sampling intervals in vertical direction ranging from 50pc in the plane to up to 500pc in the outer halo .",
    "this scheme was necessary to properly sample the radiation fields in the more optically thick central regions , where the dust associated with the thin stellar disk in conjunction with the strong positional dependence of the emissivity of the young stellar population ( in @xmath4 ) and the inner emissivity cusp of the bulge ( in both @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) can lead to quite small scale structures even in the diffuse radiation fields .",
    "we have created a library of diffuse radiation fields , calculated on a cylindrical grid @xmath6 .",
    "the radiation fields are given for different values of central face - on dust opacity in the b - band @xmath7 , which is the only parameter of the model shaping the spatial variation of the rfs .",
    "since the energy densities of the radiation fields are additive quantities , they scale with the spatially integrated luminosity density at a given wavelength . therefore we only calculate rfs for a fixed reference luminosity density .",
    "the radiation fields are separately calculated for the disk , thin disk and bulge . for the bulge we considered calculations for different values of the srsic index of the bulge .",
    "in total we performed calculations for seven values of the central face - on dust opacity , @xmath8 .",
    "solutions for other values of @xmath9 , such as for the case @xmath10 used to illustrate the solutions in this paper , can be found by interpolation .",
    "we considered four values for the srsic index of the bulge , @xmath11 . at each wavelength we therefore have 7 ( for @xmath9 ) x 2 ( for disk and thin disk ) + 7 ( for @xmath9 ) x 4 ( for srsic indices of bulge ) = 42 combinations at each sampled uv / optical / nir wavelength .",
    "we considered calculations at 15 different wavelengths , ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 m , as listed in table e.2 of popescu et al .",
    "thus , the library contains a total of 42 x 15= 630 files with two - dimensional spatial grids of energy densities of the rfs .",
    "as mentioned before , the radiation fields have been calculated for a reference spatially integrated luminosity density at each wavelength and for each stellar component .",

    "2013b ) , resulting in additional differences between the intrinsic and the measured sizes of the disk .",

    "the fact that the analytic formula works so well ( for @xmath10 ) over a large range of wavelengths , from the uv to the nir is due to the fact that the aspect ratio of our thin disk is very small , resulting in a high central edge - on dust opacity even in the nir bands .",

    "this is because for a thin disk geometry the component of energy density arising from sources within galactocentric radius @xmath5 tends ( at high radii ) towards an inverse - square law for a point source situated at @xmath38 and with luminosity equal to the total enclosed luminosity within @xmath5 .",
    "this characteristic is explicitly seen in the formula for the exact analytic solution of an infinitely thin disk given in eq .",

    "the horizon surface is a sphere , which we call `` horizon sphere '' .",

    "the horizon sphere is then the sphere with radius equal to @xmath45 ( i.e. the typical local mean free path of photons ) .",

    "the subtlety is that , when the horizon viewed from the mid - plane gets larger ( e.g. when moving in radius towards the outer disk ) eq .  [ eq : opt_thick ] still gives the correct solution as long as the variation ( primarily in z ) of stellar emissivity and opacity is the same .",
    "this is the case when the horizon sphere is contained within the thin disk , since both the stellar emissivity and the dust opacity have the same scale - height , and thus , the same spatial variation within the horizon sphere .",
    "then the mid - plane rf will remain constant .    as the radial distance increases , the horizon surface starts to become a prolate ellipsoid , because light can propagate to larger distances vertically than in the radial direction before reaching the horizon ( the scale - height of the dust is much shorter than its scalelength , by a factor 0.016 in our model ) . when the horizon gets so big that new geometrical components in emissivity and/or opacity enter into the horizon ellipsoid , and these new geometrical components have a different ratio @xmath46 than the ratio at @xmath37 , eq .",
    "[ eq : opt_thick ] will break down .",
    "this happens beyond a certain galactocentric radius , where the height of the horizon ellipsoid becomes larger than the scale - height of the thin disk .",
    "then the spatial variation of total opacity in @xmath4 within the horizon ellipsoid is no longer well approximated by the spatial variation in opacity of dust belonging to the thin disk .",
    "this is due to the dust opacity from the thick dust disk ( which has a larger scale height than that of the stellar emissivity in the thin disk ) .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : twodust_final_allorders_corr ] , the rfs will start to fall off from the maximum value reached in the ( completely ) optically thick case ( eq .  [ eq : twodust_final_allorders_corr_optthick ] ) , explaining the reduction in the mid - plane rfs in the outer disk .",

    "this is due to the fact that already in the inner region the horizon surface is given by a prolate ellipsoid and not by a sphere .",
    "because the height of this ellipsoid is always significantly larger than the scale - height of the thin stellar disk and increases progressively with increasing radius , there is a corresponding decrease in the ratio of stellar emissivity to dust opacity ( in vertical direction ) , resulting in the monotonic decrease of the rfs .",

    "from which the escaping photons are emitted . because of the much steeper z dependence of the thin disk emissivity compared to that of the thick dust disk opacity , this depth is well below the @xmath49 surface ( as seen from above)- ie the effective line - of - sight optical depth to the emitting surface is @xmath50 .",
    "this in turn means that the emitting surface has a larger extent than the extent of the @xmath49 surface as seen from @xmath37 , explaining the much flatter form of the rf curve with radius for the @xmath51kpc case compared to the @xmath37kpc case .",
    "the trends in the vertical profiles can be easily explained following the trends already discussed for the radial profiles .",
    "thus , at shorter wavelengths , where the disks are optically thick , the profiles in the centre ( @xmath38 ) show a decrease in the energy density with increasing @xmath4 , until a certain distance above the disk , from where the rf remain fairly constant ( see fig .",

    "the rf vary according to eq .",
    "[ eq : opt_thick ] , as long as the vantage point is within the dust layer .",
    "however , unlike the radial variation , in the vertical direction the rfs are affected by the two dust disk structure , where the disk opacity has a different variation from that of the stellar emissivity .",
    "the rfs will therefore decrease with increasing vertical distance from the disk , and this behavior continues also for vertical profiles at larger radii , since the disk remains optically thick for a large range of radial distances .",
    "moving still further out in @xmath4 , it becomes possible for light to freely escape upwards from an emitting surface ( below ) which marks the transition ( in the vertical direction ) from optically thick to optically thin . at a vantage point",
    "more than 500pc up , the contribution to the rfs from this surface dominates the in situ contribution from the thin stellar disk , whose emissivity is tiny at more than a few scale heights .",

    "thus , a vantage point at larger vertical distances above the disk will essentially see a constant surface - brightness until large radii , causing the rfs to remain constant higher - up above the disk .",
    "the trend of decreasing the rf with increasing @xmath4 followed by a flat trend with @xmath4 is gradually changing from shorter to longer wavelengths , as the disk becomes more optically thin .",

    "so the profiles do not show a monotonic behavior in this respect .",
    "this is because , although the vantage point above the disk will also see a constant surface brightness , the level of this is mainly determined by the thin ( small scale - height ) dust disk , since the thick dust disk ( with the larger scale - height ) becomes more optically thin . in other words at smaller radii and high z",
    "the radiation fields are equal to @xmath53 while at intermediate radii and high z the radiation fields are equal to @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the local opacities of the thick and thin dust disks , respectively .",
    "these are generalisations of eq .",
    "[ eq : twodust_final_allorders_corr_optthick ] , where the mid - plane opacities have been replaced by local opacities . as a consequence ,",
    "the surface brightness increases at a intermediate radii , since the layer of constant surface brightness moves towards the plane of the disk .",
    "there will be a radius at which a maximum in the value of the energy density of the rf at larger @xmath4 is attained , after which this will start to slowly decrease again .",
    "this causes the non - monotonic behaviour of the radiation fields above the disk with increasing radius . at longer wavelength",
    "this never happens , because the thin dust disk becomes transparent even in the inner radii .",

    "this behaviour is quite different from that of the thin disk at the same wavelengths ( see fig .  [",
