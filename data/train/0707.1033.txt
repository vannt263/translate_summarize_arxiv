    "a quantum computer , when finally built , will be more efficient than current classical computers to solve certain kinds of problems @xcite . for instance , to find the prime factors of a large integer @xmath0 of @xmath1 bits , a quantum algorithm will take a time that is a polynomial function of @xmath1 , while any classical procedure known at present takes much longer @xcite .",
    "quantum information processing generally takes advantage of the inherent parallelism exhibited by unitary operations on quantum - state superpositions .",
    "the terms of these linear combinations are tensor products of quantum bits , or `` qubits '' @xcite .",
    "a qubit is , in analogy with the `` bit '' of classical computing , the elementary unit of quantum information , represented by any state of a two - state system .",
    "thus , if the two - dimensional hilbert space for this system has an orthonormal basis given by the kets @xmath2 and @xmath3 , then a qubit is any linear combination of these basis states : @xmath4 .",
    "there is , therefore , a continuum of different qubits , while there are only two distinct classical bits : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the theory of quantum information processing is based on the preparation , unitary transformations , and measurements of superposed tensor products of qubits @xcite .",
    "the initial stage , characterized by the preparation of the computation input , and the last stage , corresponding to reading the output , consist of measuring certain observables .",
    "generating the initial superposition of states and processing quantum information are , therefore , to be achieved by performing unitary operations that cause the required interference and entanglement of the input qubits . however , the actual quantum evolution of any system is not strictly unitary , because the system can not be completely isolated from the universe .",
    "the consequent decay of the quantum - state purity is a manifestation of the celebrated phenomenon of decoherence @xcite .",
    "there are three classes of strategic devices proposed to counteract the deleterious and unavoidable effects of decoherence : quantum error correcting codes ( qecc ) @xcite , decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs ) @xcite , and dynamical decoupling ( dd ) @xcite .",
    "each one of these strategies must satisfy proper conditions for succeeding .",
    "for example , for a qecc , it is necessary to use auxiliary qubits and , generally , a low error rate is assumed so that just one qubit is perturbed during the protocol execution . for a dfs strategy , besides auxiliary qubits , a special environment symmetry that gives the direction for a suitable decoherence - free qubit encoding is also necessary",
    ". finally , the dd requires , in principle , only external - field control over a single physical qubit to protect a quantum - gate operation .",
    "the necessary condition in this case is that the control cycle be faster than the average time between environmental interventions .",
    "actually , in the great majority of the cases studied in the literature , methods based on dd utilize , to protect the information , pulsed fields , and it is considered that such pulses are so fast that the universe does not act over the system during their application . nevertheless , initial attempts to use continuously - applied fields instead of pulses have appeared recently @xcite . in a previous work",
    ", we analyzed continuous decoupling during a hadamard quantum gate , perturbed by a thermal bath of scalar bosons @xcite .",
    "we showed , for that case , that the decoherence can always be efficiently reduced by applying a superposition of two external vector fields : one rotating orthogonally to the direction of the other , which remains static .    here",
    ", we analyze the fidelity of the hadamard quantum logic operation coupled to an environment that affects the system giving rise to three classes of errors : dephasing , bit flipping , and dissipation .",
    "we examine the feasibility of dynamical decoupling based on continuously - applied high - frequency fields , considering two types of spectral densities for the environment : ohmic and super - ohmic .",
    "initially , we observe the fidelity of an unprotected hadamard quantum gate coupled to a dephasing bosonic reservoir and then illustrate the ohmic and super - ohmic cases .",
    "we define an arrangement where , in the absence of protecting control fields , the quantum - gate fidelity is lower in the ohmic case than in the super - ohmic . we show that the dynamical decoupling is achieved in the super - ohmic case only when the control - field frequency is sufficiently higher than in the ohmic case .",
    "subsequently , we consider the presence of two additional independent reservoirs , producing bit flipping and dissipation .",
    "we show , as a function of the relative coupling strengths , the relevance of bit flipping and dissipation on a phase - protected hadamard operation .",
    "finally , we introduce continuously - applied external fields , criteriously calculated to protect the hadamard operation against all three independent classes of errors .    this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the interaction of the qubit with its environment and write down the time - local second - order master equation , describing the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the qubit in the interaction picture . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the three independent reservoirs , describing dephasing , bit flipping , and dissipation . in sec .",
    "iv we consider the fidelity of a hadamard quantum gate operating under the influence of a dephasing environment and compare the ohmic and super - ohmic cases .",
    "we analyze the dynamics for all qubit initial conditions and estimate the worst fidelity with and without protection by continuous dynamical decoupling .",
    "we focus on the super - ohmic case in sec .",
    "v and add independent bit flipping and dissipation to study the influence of these perturbations on the hadamard evolution already protected against phase errors . in this section we also calculate the necessary control fields to eliminate all three classes of noise during the quantum - gate operation .",

    "( [ master2 ] ) is not restricted to a specific choice of the environmental hamiltonian .",

    "<S> we consider protecting a hadamard operation from independent dephasing , bit flipping , and dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> these environment - induced errors are represented by three uncorrelated reservoirs of thermalized bosons and we show that the protection is achievable through continuous dynamical decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , to decouple the hadamard evolution from the environmental influence , we need a control field of higher frequency if the boson spectral density is super - ohmic than if it is ohmic . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the relevance of bit flipping and dissipation to the gate fidelity when it is protected from dephasing , showing how robust this partial protection is against these other perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we calculate an efficient field arrangement capable of protecting simultaneously the gate operation from these three error classes . </S>"
