    "a practical protocol of information processing has to involve the storage and retrieval of information . in the fast - developing field of quantum information and quantum computation",
    ", a coherent storage process is particularly indispensable because the quantum information carried by some qubits manipulable is extremely fragile in usual and thus needs to be stored before decoherence happens @xcite .",
    "most existing schemes , e.g. , @xcite concern about the quantum storage of photon state instead of a qubit ( a two - level system ) state while the latter is more necessary in the universal quantum computation .",
    "recently , some investigations @xcite are devoted to explore universal quantum storage based on the solid state system since it is widely believed that the practical quantum computation should based on the scalable solid state system .    among them , a novel protocol @xcite was presented to store the quantum information of electronic spin in the ensemble @xmath0 nuclei confined in semiconductor quantum dot .",
    "physically this storage process can be described as a reversible map from the electronic spin state onto the collective spin state of the surrounding nuclear ensemble .",
    "because of the long decoherence time of the nuclear spins",
    " up to seconds @xcite , it can be regarded as a long - lived quantum memory for electronic spin qubit , in which the information stored in them can be robustly preserved .    to analyze the universal applicability of this protocol in practice",
    ", we found that @xcite , only in the low excitation with large @xmath0 limit and the relatively homogeneous couplings of electron to the nuclei , can the many - nuclei system behave as single mode boson to serve as an efficient quantum memory .",
    "the large number of nuclei in such quantum memory implies that many nuclei crowd in a single quantum dot and the inter - nucleon interaction may not be neglected in this case .",
    "this is just the first motivation of the present paper to consider the influence of the inter - nucleon interaction on the quantum storage process .    on the other hand",
    ", the low excitation condition requires a ground state with all spins oriented .",
    "usually it can only be prepared by applying a magnetic field polarizing all spins along a single direction .",
    "however , for a free nucleon ensemble without the external magnetic field , there is not such a preferred ground state with spins pointing to the same direction and thus the low excitation condition can not be satisfied automatically .",
    "but one can recognize that a ferromagnetic spin chain  the heisenberg chain usually has a spontaneous magnetization in association with the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , which naturally offers a polarization ground state .",
    "the intrinsic interaction between spins correlates the nuclei to form magnon , the collective excitation mode of spin wave , even without the external magnetic field .",
    "this observation also motivates us to explore the possibility of using a ferromagnetic quantum spin system , instead of the non - interacting nuclei ensemble , to serve as a robust quantum memory .        with these considerations , in this paper",
    ", we present and study a protocol to implement quantum storage of the electronic spin state to a ring - shape array of interacting nuclei(fig.1a ) . under appropriate control of exchange interaction between the electron spin and nuclear spins by adjusting the overlap of their wave functions ( fig.1b ) , an arbitrary quantum state of the electronic spin qubit , either pure or mixed state ,",
    "can be coherently stored in the collective mode of the nuclear spin chain , the magnon , and read out in reverse .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present the model of quantum memory element . the quantum storage process based on this model",
    "is illustrated in section iii and the inhomogeneity induced decoherence effect is analyzed in detail in section iv . in section",
    "v , conclusions and remarks are provided .",
    "to start with , we illustrate the configuration of our proposal for the solid - state based quantum memory in fig.1a .",
    "@xmath0 nuclei are arranged in a circle within a quantum dot to form a spin ring array .",
    "a single electron is just localized in the center of the ring array surrounded by the nuclei .",
    "because of the long decoherence time of the nuclei system , which is just the motivation of this protocol , we neglect the decoherence effect due to the damping of nuclei in the following discussions .",
    "the interaction of the nuclear spins is assumed to exist only between the nearest neighbors while the external magnetic field @xmath1 threads through the spin array",
    ".    then the electron - nuclei system can be modelled by a hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath3corresponds to the zeeman energy of electron with the lande @xmath4 factor @xmath5 and bohr magneton @xmath6 in a magnetic field @xmath1 along the @xmath7-direction .",
    "@xmath8    represents the hamiltonian for an ensemble of nuclear spins with the lande @xmath9 factor @xmath10 , the nuclear magneton @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the nuclear spin of the @xmath13-th site .",
    "the first term of @xmath14 is the zeeman energy of the nuclear spins and the second one is the exchange energy including dipole - dipole interaction between the nearest neighbor nuclear spins . the coupling strength @xmath15  and  this spin ensemble acts as a ferromagnetic spin chain .",
    "@xmath16    is the hyperfine contact interaction between the @xmath17-state conduction electron and the nuclei in the quantum dot .",
    "the pauli matrices @xmath18 is the electronic spin .",
    "the magnitude of each coupling term @xmath19 depends on the overlap of the `` large '' wave function and the `` localized '' wave function of each nucleon schematically illustrated in fig.1 b and is estimated to be in the order of @xmath20ghz with the same parameter in ref ( @xcite ) .",
    "the electronic wave function is supposed to be cylindrical symmetric , e.g. , the s - wave component .",
    "thus the coupling coefficient @xmath21 defined by the electron wave function @xmath22 is almost homogenous for all the @xmath0 nuclei in the ring array .",
    "the denominator @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ * ] ) originates from the envelope normalization of the localized electron wave - function lukin4,zoller , exp .",
    "after the holstein - primakoff transformation @xmath23 in terms of bosonic annihilation operator @xmath24 , the hamiltonian @xmath14 can be expressed in the low excitation limit @xmath25with the bosonic excitations as@xmath26while the hamiltonian of hyperfine contact interaction can be re - written as @xmath27which is modelled as a system with one spin and @xmath0 interacting bosons .",
    "the discrete fourier transformation @xmath28is used to diagonalize the total hamiltonian as @xmath29where @xmath30is the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) type hamiltonian where @xmath31 .",
    "the new boson operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined by the above equation ( 2 ) describe the the spin wave excitation , the magnon , with the dispersion relation @xmath34    the above results show that @xmath35 only contains the interaction of the @xmath0-th magnon mode with the electronic spin while the other @xmath36 magnons are decoupled with it .",
    "actually this is the consequence of the cylindrical symmetry induced by the homogeneity of couplings of the electronic spin to the nuclei . as noted in eq .",
    "( and [ * * * ] ) , the hamiltonian is invariant under any permutation of the nuclear spins . in the terminology of group theory ,",
    "the permutation symmetrical group @xmath37 is the symmetry transformation group of the nuclei system and thus there exist @xmath38 two - dimensional @xmath39-invariant subspaces @xmath40 spanned by @xmath41where @xmath42is a symmetric state in the spatial configuration of the nuclear ensemble , which is an symmetrical combination of all the bosonic excitation defined on the @xmath0-th magnon mode ; @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) denotes the electronic spin up  ( down ) state .",
    "@xmath45 is the total spin of the state @xmath46 ; @xmath47 denotes the ground state with all the nuclear spins oriented in the same direction perpendicular to the spin chain surface . under certain approximation",
    ", there also exist other @xmath48-invariant subspaces @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) in the @xmath51-th magnon mode similarly .",
    "since the symmetric term @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) only belongs to the total symmetric sector of the @xmath37 group , it can not change the states out of the same sector of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-th mode is singled out as the only coupling term .",
    "the process of quantum information storage of the electronic spin can be implemented in the invariant subspace with @xmath0-th magnon . here ,",
    "the frequency @xmath54 of boson mode and the level spacing @xmath55 can be modulated by the external field @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "such spin - boson interaction forms the basis for ion - trap based quantum computation as well @xcite . with various physical systems , people have proposed several spin - boson models based protocols for the universal quantum information storage . for example , the nano - mechanical resonator interacting with josephson junction ( jj ) phase qubits cleland can be considered for universal quantum memory .",
    "we have analyzed the progressive decoherence process of such spin - boson model with nano - mechanical resonator @xcite .",
    "it is just this idealized scheme that motivates us to seek another more practical protocol based on the collective bosonic excitation in various physical systems .",
    "the quantum storage process is described as follows .",
    "suppose the initial state of the total system is prepared so that there is no excitation in the @xmath56 nuclei at all while the electron is in an arbitrary state @xmath57where @xmath43 ( @xmath58 ) still denotes the electronic spin up  ( down ) state .",
    "the quantum information carried by the electron is represented by the coefficients @xmath59 .",
    "the initial state of the total system can then be written as @xmath60 in terms of @xmath61 where @xmath62(for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath36 ) denotes the fock state of the other @xmath36 magnons . if we set @xmath66 , then @xmath67 and the effective hamiltonian @xmath68 becomes @xmath69with @xmath70 .",
    "driven by such resonant jc  hamiltonian the time evolution from @xmath71 at @xmath72is just described as a factorized state @xmath73where @xmath74is the state of the @xmath0-th magnon after storing with @xmath75here , to simplify our expression , we have defined @xmath76the difference between @xmath77 and @xmath78 is only a diagonal unitary transformation @xmath79__is independent of the stored initial state _ _ @xmath80 and can be cancelled by redefining the computational basis .",
    "this means the quantum information carried by the electron has been transferred to the nuclei .",
    "the above calculation demonstrates that , by placing the electron near the nuclei and switching off the magnetic field , the quantum information carried by the electron spin can be mapped onto the @xmath0-th mode of the spin wave after a time duration @xmath81 .",
    "after the electron is removed away from the nuclei , the @xmath0-th magnon will not undergo dynamic evolution and thus the stored quantum information is well preserved . to read out the information again",
    ", one just needs to reverse the operation with the same time duration @xmath82 .",
    "it seems that the external magnetic field does not play a role in this storage process , but it helps to prepare the initial state of nuclear spins with all spins allied to its opposite direction . after this preparation , the magnetic field can be turned off all through . the ferromagnetic interaction among spins",
    "spontaneously breaks the isotropically degenerate ground state into this special direction and prevents the system from high excitations and perturbations and thus it serves to stabilize the system . because the total hamiltonian @xmath35 decouples from the interactions between the other @xmath36 magnons and the electronic spin , the above protocol is still valid for any other initial state of @xmath36 magnons such as the thermal state so long as the @xmath0-th mode is prepared in the vacuum stateszs .    for the experimental implementation of the above protocol , the manipulation induced perturbations need to be discussed .",
    "as it seems from the above illustrations , this proposal requires an instantaneous control of the interaction between the electronic spin and the nuclear spins",
    ". however it is known that the interaction can never be switched on and off instantaneously .",
    "therefore the coupling coefficient @xmath83 should be an analytical function of time @xmath84 , that is , @xmath85 .",
    "actually the finite rise - and - fall time of the control pulse causes deviation from the ideal calculation in many cases .",
    "fortunately , in our protocol , _",
    "this instantaneous time control is not really an indispensable part as it seems_. from eq .",
    "( [ * * * 2 ] ) , we can see that the free hamiltonians for the electronic spin and the @xmath0-th magnon are both zero .",
    "the total effective hamiltonian @xmath86at different instant are still commutative and then the evolution operator can be exactly @xmath87unlike the usual time order integral .",
    "therefore , the time - dependence of the coupling term only leads to a modification of the operation time @xmath81 .",
    "so long as the new operation time @xmath88 satisfying @xmath89@xmath90 is still factorized  as the eq.(***3 ) to record the quantum information of the initial state exactly .     to drive the electron an external electrical field , which drive",
    "the electron moving upward and downward along the axis that perpendicular to the plane.,width=170,height=132 ]    another difficulty in the implementation is due to the perturbation of magnetic field caused by the electron . to store ( retrieve ) the information of the electronic spin to the nuclear spin chain one needs to monitor the coupling strength .",
    "for example we can remove the electron along the axis perpendicular to the plane where the ring spin array locates ( see fig.2 ) . to maintain the symmetry of interaction between the electron and nuclear ensemble , the axis threads through the center of the ring of spins . generally , the motion of electron is not at a constant velocity .",
    "the accelerated motion generates a magnetic field according to maxwell equation . for example , if we use an external electrical field @xmath91 to drive the electron ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , the acceleration of the electron is proportional to the magnitude of @xmath91 .",
    "the additional magnetic force will change the states of the nuclear spin systems since both the ground state and energy spectrum of magnons depend on the external magnetic field .",
    "this perturbation might be fatal for the free spin chains but less serious for our correlated spin chain since the interaction obviates the random flips of the nuclear spins .",
    "thus the effect of this manipulation induced perturbation is greatly suppressed and this kind of spin chain acts as a more robust quantum memory .",
    "so far we have discussed the ideal case with homogeneous coupling between the electron and the nuclei , that is , the coupling coefficients are the same constant @xmath83 for all the nuclear spins .",
    "however , the inhomogeneous effect of coupling coefficients has to be taken into account if we concern some cases beyond the strictly cylindrical symmetric effective coupling . in this case",
    ", the quantum decoherence induced by the so - called quantum leakage has been extensively investigated for the atomic ensemble based quantum memory @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the similar problems for the magnon based quantum memory .    for the general case ,",
    "@xmath92 vary with the positions of the nuclear spins where @xmath93 is the wave function of the electron at site @xmath94 . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian contains other terms besides the interaction between the spin and @xmath0-th mode boson , that is , the inhomogeneity induced interaction @xmath95should be added in our model hamiltonian @xmath35 with @xmath96\\]]are dimensionless coefficients representing the relative magnitude of coupling .    for a gaussian distribution of @xmath97 ,",
    "e.g. @xmath98\\]]with width @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the corresponding inhomogeneous coupling is depicted by @xmath101}{\\sqrt{2\\pi } \\sigma } \\]]fig.3 shows the magnitude of @xmath102 for the different gaussian distributions of @xmath97 with different widths @xmath99 .",
    "it can be seen that the coupling is stronger for the modes near mode @xmath103 and @xmath36 than those far away from them .",
    "when the interaction gets more homogenous ( with larger @xmath99 ) , the coupling coefficients @xmath102 for all the @xmath104 to @xmath36 modes become smaller .",
    "it can be imagined that when the distribution is completely homogeneous ( with @xmath105 ) , all the couplings with the @xmath36 magnon modes vanish and the hamiltonian @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ * ] ) is obtained .",
    "( @xmath106 ) for different gaussian distributions .",
    "the three curves represent the distributions with width @xmath107 ( in triangle ) , @xmath108 ( in hollow box ) , @xmath109 ( in pentagram ) respectively . here",
    "@xmath110.,width=245,height=151 ]    for the above model for quantum dissipation of two - level system @xcite , various approaches have been presented to deal with the dynamic evolution of the spin - boson model for different types of bath , such as the markovian method @xcite and the exact solutions in the ohmic regime sun - yu .",
    "most recently , divincenzo and loss explored the calculation of the next order born approximation for the dissipation of such spin - boson model @xcite . in the following we will adopt a rather direct method to analyze the decoherence problem for two limiting case .    if @xmath0 is so large that the spectrum of the quantum memory is quasi - continuous , this model is similar to the `` standard model '' of quantum dissipation for the vacuum induced spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 magnons will induce the quantum dissipation of the electronic spin with decay rate@xmath111 let @xmath112 be the ideal evolution governed by the expected hamiltonian without dissipation while the realistic evolution @xmath113 governed by the hamiltonian with dissipation term eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) .",
    "suppose the initial state of the electron is @xmath114 we can obtain the analytical result of the fidelity @xmath115 where @xmath116    fig .",
    "4 shows the curve of the fidelity @xmath117 varying with time @xmath118 .",
    "we can see that the fidelity exhibits exponential decay behavior with sinusoidal oscillation . at the instance that",
    "the quantum storage process is just finished , the fidelity is about @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , the deviation from the ideal case with homogeneous couplings is very small for @xmath120 .",
    "since the ring - shape spin array with inhomogeneous coupling is just equivalent to an arbitrary heisenberg spin chain in the large @xmath0 limit , the above arguments means that an arbitrary heisenberg chain can be used for quantum storage following the same strategy above if @xmath121 is small , i.e. , the inhomogeneous effect is not very strong .     in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the vertical line indicates the instant  @xmath122 , at which the quantum storage is just implemented . here",
    "the inset shows the decaying oscillation with details of @xmath124 in a small region near the instant @xmath122 . here",
    "@xmath118 is in the unit of @xmath125.,width=245,height=151 ]    on the other hand , if @xmath0 is small , the spectrum of the quantum memory is discrete enough to guarantee the adiabatic elimination of the @xmath36 magnon modes , i.e. , @xmath126for the @xmath36 magnon modes . as a consequence of this adiabatic elimination ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath127can be obtained by ignoring the fast oscillating terms where @xmath128    it can be seen from the above hamiltonian that , though the electronic spin qubit and the memory mode @xmath129 do not exchange energy with the other @xmath36 modes , the last term in @xmath130 implies that they can record the `` which - way '' information carried by the electronic qubit .",
    "then it causes dephasing , and also leads to mixing of different magnon modes . however , if the initial state can be prepared in vacuum state for all the magnon modes , only the diagonal terms concerning the magnon modes remain .",
    "the deviation from the ideal case can also be estimated by the fidelity @xmath124 @xmath131where @xmath132and @xmath133fig .",
    "5 illustrates the time evolution of this fidelity @xmath124 .",
    "it is a fast - oscillating function .",
    "however , under the condition of adiabatic elimination , it is a slow - varying function around the storage instance @xmath134 and @xmath135     in small @xmath0 limit .",
    "the vertical line indicates the instant  @xmath136  to implement quantum storage . here",
    "@xmath137 is @xmath138 and @xmath118 is in the unit of @xmath125.,width=245,height=151 ]    thus we can conclude that in the presence of inhomogeneity the fidelity is still high in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "therefore , to suppress the decoherence induced by other modes of magnon , @xmath0 should be made large . however , as noted from eq .",
    "( [ * * * * ] ) , the energy spectrum is related to @xmath0 and it is quasi - continuous in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "if the energy spacing is smaller than @xmath139 ( @xmath140 is the boltzman constant ) , the thermal fluctuation will wash out the quantum coherent effect .",
    "this should be avoided by using a spin chain with @xmath141the value of @xmath0 is restricted by the two requirement and the optimum number of @xmath0 can be found within this range considering practical parameters in experiments .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a novel protocol of universal quantum storage for the electronic spin qubit based on the ring array of nuclear spin . here , the quantum memory unit is the spin wave excitation ( magnon ) of the spin chain .",
    "we illustrated how the quantum information of an arbitrary state of a two - level system can be coherently mapped from the electron to the spin wave quantum memory .",
    "the mechanism for quantum decoherence induced by the inhomogeneity of couplings between the electronic spin and the nuclear spins is also investigated . in the presence of inhomogeneity ,",
    "the interaction with other magnon modes is involved and the time evolution of the whole system inevitably deviates from the ideal case .",
    "this results in the less - than - unity fidelity . what",
    "more , some other problems arise .",
    "for example , if the initial state is a superposition of the states @xmath142 with different @xmath143 , this added term leads to the entanglement of the electronic spin and the magnon states so that the two parts can not be factorized .",
    "thus the quantum information storage can not be implemented effectively .",
    "therefore this inhomogeneity imposes a strict restriction on the initial state of magnon modes .",
    "another obstacle is the @xmath7 -component coupling between the nuclear spins and the single electron spin . in more general cases",
    "this coupling can not be neglected . for the homogeneous couplings ,",
    "if the @xmath36 magnons are prepared in a specific subspace spanned by @xmath144 that @xmath145 is the same , our protocol still works efficiently even including such @xmath7-component coupling . for the case with inhomogeneous couplings",
    ", this term results in the additional interactions among the magnons .",
