    "art is a collection of objects created with the intention of transmitting emotions and/or ideas .",
    "an object can be characterized by intentions of its creator , regardless of its apparent purpose . in this sense",
    ", art is described as a deliberate process of arrangement by an agent .",
    "art stimulates an individual s thoughts , emotions , beliefs , or ideas through the senses .",
    "it is also an expression of an idea and it can take many different forms and serve many different purposes .",
    "mathematics and art are examples of human motivations to understand reality @xcite .",
    "the connection between mathematics and art goes back to thousands of years .",
    "patterns , symmetries , proportions and transformations are fundamental concepts common to both disciplines .",
    "one of the connections between mathematics and art is that some known as artists have needed to develop or use mathematical thinking to carry out their artistic insight .",
    "thus we are forced to use interpretative techniques in order to search for them . in particular , there are several obvious relations between art and mathematics such as music @xcite and painting @xcite .",
    "painting has three principal parts : drawing , proportion and coloring .",
    "drawing is outlines and contours contained in a painting .",
    "proportion is these outlines and contours positioned in proportion in their places .",
    "coloring is giving colors to things .",
    "one can obviously use mathematical geometry to analyze paintings , figurative or abstract , in terms of shapes such as points and lines , circles and triangles .",
    "one may think of the application of the perspective theory to figurative painting , or the use of some concepts like fractals for comprehension of abstract paintings .",
    "an important example is the analysis of jackson pollock s drip paintings in terms of fractal geometry @xcite .    here , we are interested to study the fractal nature of painting from another point of view which in general",
    ", could be applicable to non - stationary series @xcite . among various paintings we focus on characterizing the complexity of color signal of `` mona lisa '' through computation of signal parameters and scaling exponents , which quantifies correlation exponents and multifractality of the signal .",
    "mona lisa , or la gioconda ( la joconde ) , is a 16th century oil painting on poplar wood by leonardo da vinci , and is the most famous painting in the world .",
    "this painting is a half - length portrait which depicts a woman whose gaze meets the viewer s with an enigmatic expression ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "because of non - stationary nature of color signal series , and due to finiteness of available data sample , we should apply methods which are insensitive to non - stationarities , like trends . in order",
    "to separate trends from correlations we need to eliminate trends in our color data .",
    "several methods are used effectively for this purpose : detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite , rescaled range analysis ( r / s ) @xcite and wavelet techniques ( wt ) @xcite . however , using increment series is customary to make a stationary series from a non - stationary ones @xcite .",
    "mona lisa : oil painting on poplar wood by leonardo da vinci.,width=226 ]    we use mf - dfa method for analysis and eliminating trends from data set .",
    "this method is the modified version of dfa method to detect multifractal properties of time series .",
    "dfa method introduced by peng",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite has become a widely used technique for the determination of monofractal scaling properties and the detection of long - range correlations in noisy , non - stationary time series @xcite .",
    "it has successfully been applied to diverse fields @xcite .",
    "one reason to employ dfa method is to avoid spurious detection of correlations that are artefacts of non - stationarity series .",
    "the focus of the present paper is on the fractality nature of color series obtained from mona lisa . to construct the series ,",
    "we calculate the standard color values of each pixel of the picture successively for each row from up to down , continuously .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows mona lisa and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows its gray , red , green and blue color styles for a @xmath0 pixels sample .",
    "the color fluctuation graphs of gray and red styles , are also depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we describe mf - dfa methods in detail and show that scaling exponents determined by mf - dfa method are identical to those obtained by standard multifractal formalism based on partition functions . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , in analysis of color series of mona lisa we also examine the multifractality in color data .",
    "section [ sec4 ] closes with a conclusion .",
    "the simplest type of multifractal analysis is based upon standard partition function multifractal formalism , which has been developed for multifractal characterization of normalized , stationary measurements @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this standard formalism does not give us correct results for non - stationary time series that are affected by trends or those which can not be normalized .",
    "mf - dfa is based on identification of scaling of @xmath1th - order moment depending on signal length , and this is a generalization of standard dfa method in which @xmath2",
    ". moreover one should find correct scaling behavior of fluctuations , from experimental data which are often affected by non - stationary sources , like trends .",
    "these have to be well distinguished from intrinsic fluctuations of the system .",
    "in addition , often in collected data we do not know the reasons , or even worse the scales , for underlying trends , and also available record data is usually small .",
    "so , for a reliable detection of correlations , it is essential to distinguish trends for intrinsic fluctuations from collected data .",
    "hurst rescaled - range analysis @xcite and other non - detrending methods work well when records are long and do not involve trends , otherwise they might give wrong results .",
    "dfa is a well established method for determining scaling behavior of noisy data where the data include trends and their origin and shape are unknown @xcite .",
    "gray , red , green and blue style pictures ( up to down respectively ) of mona lisa , width=151 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "using detrended methods for analyzing paintings , we can study the artistic manner of the painter , regardless of subject of the artworks .",
    "this is due to the fact that a painting consists of objects which can be considered as trends .",
    "the non - stationary property of paintings can be related to the objects , light and shadow , etc . indeed by detrending methods , we eliminate trends from paintings and make the signal stationary .",
    "it means , we reduce the effects of objects , light and shadow , etc . from paintings .",
    "we have used multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to detrend data to characterize the most famous artistic work of leonardo da vinci and shown the fractality of this painting .",
    "our results using mf - dfa show that color series of mona lisa almost has the same behavior in various scales for all studied color styles ( red , green , blue and gray ) .",
    "we would like to thank m. mirzaei and m. vahabi for useful discussion and comments .",
