    "@xcite on the possibility of the cdm axino .",
    "modern cosmology needs dark matter and dark energy in the universe : @xmath0 .",
    "there are several particle candidates for the cdm : heavy neutrino in the gev range , axion in the @xmath1  ev range , the lightest superpartner(lsp ) in the 100  gev range , wimpzilla in the @xmath2  gev range , axino , and other hypothetical heavy particles .",
    "the particle mass and the interaction strength are provided by particle physics . in the standard big bang cosmology ,",
    "this information leads to the decoupling temperature(@xmath3 ) below which the number of particles in the comoving volume is preserved .",
    "but the needed inflationary period reheats the universe , after a period of supercoolong , to the reheating temperature @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 , the particles are mostly diluted out and the first guess on its number density is that it can not serve as dark matter(dm ) . but even after the reheating phase , the thermal production can be effective enough to create sufficient number of heavy particles to close the universe .",
    "it has been most extensively studied for the case of o(100  gev ) gravitino@xcite . because of the gravitino problem , we consider the reheating temperature below @xmath6  gev .    for @xmath7 , the dm candidates are    * neutrinos : @xmath8 is the interaction strength .",
    "* lsp : @xmath9 is the interaction strength .    for @xmath5 , the dm candidates are    * axion : @xmath10 is the interaction srength",
    ". collective motion of axions below the qcd phase transion contributes .",
    "* axino : @xmath10 is the interaction strength .",
    "thermal and nonthermal productions contribute .",
    "before discussing the axino cdm possibility , let us briefly review the cold axions , collectively moving in the universe .",
    "the basic difference of the axion candidate from the other ones is that axion is boson and it is possible to have a collective motion .",
    "the classical axion potential is extremely flat due to the very tiny invisible axion mass@xcite .",
    "because of the extremely weak interaction strength , the axion vacuum stays at a point @xmath11 for a long time .",
    "the vacuum starts to oscillate when the hubble time ( @xmath12 ) is larger than the oscillation period ( @xmath13),@xmath14 which occurs when the temperature is about 1  gev@xcite .",
    "we understand that the axion is the pseudo - scalar field , having the interaction only through the anomaly @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dual field strength @xmath17 .",
    "we stress that there should not exist any other term in the axion potential .",
    "this kind of nonrenormalizable interaction can arise in several different ways :    * from fundamental interaction such as in superstring@xcite : @xmath18 planck mass . * from composite models@xcite : @xmath18 compositeness scale . * from renormalizable theories@xcite : a global symmetry can have a gluon anomaly .",
    "if this global symmetry is spontaneously broken , there arises a goldstone boson coupling to the gluon anomaly . @xmath18",
    "the global symmetry breaking scale .",
    "then the current axion energy density is estimated to be@xcite @xmath19 if @xmath20 is large(@xmath21  gev ) , the axion energy dominates the current energy density in the universe .",
    "since the energy density is proportional to the number density , it behaves like a cdm . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath20 is small then the axion interaction is relatively strong and too much axions are produced in the core of stars .",
    "sn1987a restricts its lower bound around @xmath6  gev , leading to the axion window @xmath22    the gravitino produced thermally after inflation decays very late in the cosmic time scale(@xmath23",
    "s ) , and can dissociate the light nuclei by its decay products@xcite .",
    "inflation was used to dilute the primordial gravitinos , but thermal production of gravitinos are troublesome in cosmology if it exceeds@xcite @xmath24 therefore , in supersymmetric theories we must consider relatively small reheating temperature after inflation .",
    "therefore , in supersymmetric extension of the axion model , axion can be a cdm candidate but it is produced very late .",
    "its supersymmetric partner is axino , and the reheating temperature @xmath4 must be smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "the axion @xmath25 and axino @xmath26 are gathered in a supermultiplet , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scalar partner of axion , the saxion .",
    "the axion couples to the gluon anomaly through @xmath29 .",
    "it is known that the potential arising from this gluon interaction settles @xmath30 at zero , which is the peccei - quinn mechanism .",
    "for axino to be cdm , it must be stable or practically stable . without the @xmath31-parity conservation",
    ", this can not happen .",
    "thus , we require a practical _ r - parity conservation_. for axino to be the lsp , it must be lighter than the lightest neutralino whose mass is expected to be around 100  gev . thus , an estimate of the axino mass is of prime importance for a cdm axino .",
    "note that there is no theoretical upper bound on the axino mass .",
    "since axion is almost massless , one might expect that the axino and saxion are almost massless in the first approximation .",
    "however , the saxion obtains a soft mass term below susy breaking scale .",
    "it is like the sm susy scalars .",
    "so the axino mass is intimately reated to the susy breaking scenario also .",
    "actually , it is known that the axino obtains a substantial mass@xcite . for a specific model , including the soft susy breaking terms , consider @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the sm singlets , and the supersymmetric term comes from the superpotential @xmath35 . since @xmath36 is of order @xmath20 , @xmath37 is of order the @xmath38 term .",
    "thus , the fermionic partners have the mass matrix of the form , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "one eigenvalue is the axino mass @xmath41 , and the other masses are of order @xmath20 . as seen from this example",
    ", the axino mass is basically a free parameter , but is expected to be somewhat smaller than the naive susy breaking scale due to the coupling @xmath42@xcite .",
    "but in some models , the axino mass can be much smaller than the susy breaking scale .",
    "take a superpotential @xmath43 with one more singlet @xmath44 which carries a vanishing pq charge .",
    "this superpotential is much more complicated to analyze , but still we can show that @xmath45 . for the standard pattern of soft terms , @xmath46 .",
    "then , the axino mass is of order kev .",
    "thus , even the tree level axino mass needs the knowledge on the full superpotential@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can consider the axino mass a free parameter , and we restrict our discussion in the region where axino is the lsp , which is the most probable choice with the pq symmetry .",
    "the universal axion coupling is to the anomaly term .",
    "therefore , the axino coupling to the gauge multiplet is the most important couplings . for the fermions , only the coupling to the top quark",
    "is important .",
    "we consider all these couplings when they become appropriate .",
    "the axino decoupling temperature is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the domain wall number in axion models and @xmath49 is the axion decay constant in units of @xmath50  gev . for @xmath7 , at @xmath3 the number density is determined . for axinos not to close the universe , it should not exceed 12.8  ev  @xmath51 where @xmath52 , which was used for the o(@xmath53  kev ) warm dm axino by rajagopal _ et al._@xcite .",
    "but in our @xmath54 case , due to the gravitino problem@xcite , we do not consider this region seriously . on the other hand",
    ", we can consider much heavier axinos .",
    "the estimation of the axino density in the universe is considered for the thermal case and for the non - thermal case(by the neutralino decay ) .    for the thermal production ,",
    "we solve the boltzmann equation , @xmath55 the axino yield , the number density divided by the entropy @xmath56 , is split into two pieces one from the scattering process and the other by the decay , @xmath57 where @xmath58 for the scattering , we consider ten important processes shown in table 1 .",
    ".the cross sections for the different axino thermal production channels involving strong interactions .",
    "masses are neglected except for the plasmon mass @xmath59 . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab1.1a ]    on the other hand , the non - thermal production is basically by the decay process of the very long lived neutralino@xcite .",
    "these contributions are shown in fig .",
    "1 . for a low reheating temperature ,",
    "the thermal production is not effective . in fig .",
    "1 , the bulge at the lower left corner is the non - thermal production .     as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath60  gev and @xmath61  tev . ]    in fig . 1",
    ", we show for @xmath60  gev so that the cold axions are not the dominant component of cdm .    for the calculation of the non - thermal production , we consider losp and nlsp where losp is the lightest superpartner among ordinary sm particles and nlsp is the next - to - lsp or the second lightest superpartner .",
    "it is most likely that the losp is the lightest bino - like neutralino and nlsp can be losp or gravitino or something else . for a bino - like losp @xmath62 ,",
    "the decoupling temperature of the losp is @xmath63 . at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ,",
    "the losp decays during the radiation dominated era to produce axinos through @xmath66 to yield@xcite @xmath67 therefore , we have a simple expression , @xmath68 the neutralino decays at the cosmic time @xmath69 depending on the models , the decay modes can be different . if there are more channels for the @xmath62 decay , then it will give an even more efficient implementation of the non - themal production of axino through the neutralino decay .",
    "we must impose the conditions that ( 1 ) not too much axino energy density at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis(bbn ) , ( 2 ) the bbn not spoiled by @xmath62 decay producing the sm particles , and ( 3 ) axinos becoming cold before the galaxy formation era .    note in passing that if @xmath70 , i.e. for the gravitino nlsp then the gravitino problem disappears since it decays to axion and axino@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath62 is the nlsp , the gravitino problem is present@xcite . in this case , the non - thermally produced axinos are estimated to give eq .",
    "( [ number ] ) .     and axino mass . ]    in fig .",
    "2 , we include all these constraints and plot the restriction on the reheating temperature versus axino mass .",
    "this figure is not changed even if there is no gravitino problem because of the gravitino nlsp .",
    "the shaded region is where the axino can be a cdm possibility .",
    "this happens o(gev ) axino .",
    "note that for a high reheating temperature the thermal production contribution dominates . in the figure",
    ", there is the solid line denoting the critical energy density by axinos .",
    "even if the reheating temperature is below the critical energy density line , there still exists a axino cdm possibility by non - thermally produced axinos@xcite .",
    "note that non - thermally produced axinos can be cdm for relatively low reheating temperature(@xmath71  tev ) for which axino mass should be @xmath72 the shaded region corresponds to the mssm models with the constraint @xmath73 but still allowable axino energy density .",
    "one can choose 30 % cdm in this region .",
    "however , if we restrict further that all susy mass parameters are below 1  tev , then we have @xmath74 . for a sufficient axino energy density for the axino cdm",
    ", then we have @xmath75 but less than the neutralino mass .",
    "if @xmath31-parity is exact , then the cdm axino can not decay , and there is no way to prove the cdm axino possibility . if there is any chance to prove the cdm axino by observation , then the axino must decay@xcite .",
    "for it to constitute most of cdm in the universe , its lifetime must be of order the age of the universe . since it is assumed to be the lsp , the @xmath31-parity must be feebly broken .",
    "then the cdm axino can decay .",
    "for the simplicity of discussion , let us consider the bilinear terms only @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the flavor index , @xmath78(ev ) is the constraint from the neutrino mass bound .",
    "this bound applies to the heaviest neutrino , presumably @xmath79 . in this case",
    "@xmath80 is bounded as @xmath81 with the @xmath31-parity violation , we expect the decays @xmath82 in fact , the @xmath83 mode is most important in cosmology . for the cosmic importance of the decay , we need to know the lifetime .",
    "let us try phenomenological lagrangians , @xmath84\\psi,\\ ] ] for the final pseudo - scalar and photon , respectively .",
    "then , for each case the lifetime can be estimated .",
    "in particular , to the photon mode @xmath85\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the phase space factor .",
    "@xmath87 is known if the @xmath31-parity violation is given . since the most stringent bound comes from the diffuse gamma ray , we focus on this mode .",
    "the observed gamma ray flux is @xmath88.\\ ] ]    if @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the age of the universe , most axinos have decayed by now and the flux has a peak at @xmath91 .",
    "since the photons from axino decay should not exceed the observed flux , we obtain @xmath92 which is in conflict with @xmath93  s.    if @xmath94 , a similar consideration gives the axino lifetime larger than @xmath95  s. this translates to the @xmath80 bound , @xmath96 if @xmath80 in ( [ mu3 ] ) is taken , the idea of neutrino mass generation by @xmath31-parity violation is not enough .",
    "thus , the unstable cdm axino is not viable with the neutrino mass generation by @xmath31-parity violation .",
    "still , the cdm axino decay can be detected if the parameters lie in the region given above .",
    "in conclusion , we discussed    * supersymmetry is the solution of the gauge hierarchy problem , and the pq symmetry with a very light axion with @xmath97  gev is the solution of the strong cp problem .",
    "this leads to the axino which can be the lsp . *",
    "the gravitino problem must be considered in this case , with @xmath98  gev . * due to the much more stronger axino production than the gravitino production , @xmath4 must be much smaller than the one given by the gravitino consideration .",
    "it can be in a multi tev region . *",
    "thermal and nonthermal production of axinos are possible . in this case , o(gev ) axino cdm possibility exists . * finally , the attempt to explain the neutrino mass via the @xmath31-parity violation mechanism is inconsistent with the cdm axino .",
    "however , in this case there is a room for the detection of axino decay debris .",
