    "currently , the popular model for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows is the fireball - shock model ( for recent reviews , see zhang & mszros 2004 ; piran 2005 ; mszros 2006 ) . in this model ,",
    "the short - term prompt emission of grbs is ascribed to internal shocks in the ejecta , and the long - term afterglow at lower energy is ascribed to external shocks sweeping up the circum - stellar medium .",
    "the rapid localization of the _ swift gamma - ray burst explorer _",
    "@xcite has led to a recent breakthrough in the detections of early afterglows .",
    "this has given rise to theoretical studies of the early afterglow emission , especially in x - ray energy , thanks to the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard _",
    "swift_.    recently , an x - ray halo around the short grb 050724 was detected by xrt , with both a radial temporal evolution and intensity distribution that are consistent with the properties of galactic dust - scattering @xcite .",
    "previously , grb 031203 @xcite and grb 050713a @xcite had also been found to have similar dust - scattered x - ray halos , as observed by _ xmm - newton_. in addition , a careful inspection of the _ xmm - newton _ data shows the presence of some diffuse emission in the field of grb 050730 , which could also be produced by dust - scattering , although this needs to be verified @xcite .",
    "note that host galaxies have been found for some grbs localized so far .",
    "most of these galaxies show signs of active star formation , implying the presence of grb progenitors forming out of dense gaseous clouds @xcite .",
    "thus , dust - scattering off of dust grains may be common in grb phenomena , which could have been playing an important role in the observed x - ray afterglows .",
    "a diffuse x - ray halo is predicted to appear around an x - ray point source when the interstellar dust grains scatter some of the x - rays , typically by @xmath0 to 1@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this time - dependent information about scattering in grbs was previously considered by @xcite , who assumed the existence of binary companions or accretion disks in grb systems ; a compton echo of reflected x - ray and gamma - ray emission with a time profile mimicking the primary burst emission was expected .",
    "the features of delayed echo emission were also discussed in detail by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in a variety of emission geometries and ambient gas distributions around grbs .    in this paper , the scattering of x - rays by dust grains in grbs",
    "is revisited .",
    "we estimate the emerging flux during such an x - ray echo event , which is expected to be dominant in the x - ray afterglow .",
    "we find that an initial pulse of x - rays from a normal grb scattering off dust grains in a host galaxy can give rise to a long - term  afterglow \" with almost the same amount of energy as expected in grb x - ray afterglows .",
    "however , the angular size of this echo emission is too small to be possibly resolved on earth .",
    "therefore , only the temporal features of the total scattered flux are considered here .",
    "we find that some of these features are consistent with observations of grb x - ray afterglows .",
    "we discuss the prominent flux of x - ray echo emission in @xmath2 2 and the temporal behavior in @xmath2 3 .",
    "we suggest in @xmath2 4 that dust scattering of prompt x - ray emission off host dust grains may be an alternative explanation for some of the grb x - ray afterglows .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in @xmath2 5 .",
    "the quantity that we first consider is the amount of energy .",
    "this should be evaluated for the scattering effect in the context of grbs at the first step to make sure that scattering off dust grains can viably produce a detectable x - ray afterglow .",
    "this was previously discussed by @xcite .",
    "we follow his result here .    considering a variable x - ray source at angular diameter distance @xmath3 , and an intervening dust layer ( e.g. a galaxy or a cloud ) at redshift @xmath4 and with angular diameter distance @xmath5 , the time delay @xmath6 of photons received at an angle @xmath7 from the source scattered by the dust layer",
    "is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the angular diameter distance from the dust layer to the source .",
    "see figure 1 for the geometry of the scattering .    for simplicity , the variable source is assumed to emit most of its energy in a narrow energy band ( e.g. 210 kev ) with a given fluence @xmath10 , in a time much shorter than @xmath6 .",
    "thus we can approximate the source emission as a pulse of monochromatic light with wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "if an experiential size distribution of grains in the intervening dust layer is assumed , i.e. , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scattering optical depth of dust grains with radius @xmath14 , the total flux of the x - ray echo due to the small - angle scattering can be estimated by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is approximately satisfied , @xmath17 is the mean gas column density over the layer , and @xmath18 is the total metallicity in dust grains . here",
    "the differential cross section is treated as an approximation of the mie solution , which is given in the form of the  rayleigh - gans \" approximation in @xmath2 3 .    using the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( eq . [ 1 ] ) in equation ( 2 ) yields @xmath19 where the echo flux is a function of the time delay @xmath6 .",
    "we should point out that ( 1 ) this equation is a good estimate of the flux of x - ray echoes , from which we can get a preliminary idea of how much the flux will be at a given @xmath6 and whether it will be detectable at the time of interest .",
    "we discuss this issue later in this section .",
    "( 2 ) considering the typical scattering angle implied by the value of @xmath20 , equation ( 3 ) is only valid before or around @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the speed of light .",
    "( 3 ) this equation implies that a pulse of light propagating through a dusty region will produce a long - term delayed emission , which is like an  afterglow \" of this pulse ( see fig .",
    "we call this a dust - scattering  driven afterglow .",
    "we work out its detailed light curve in @xmath2 3 .",
    "equation ( 3 ) suggests that the flux of echoes is substantially determined by the given geometry of dust scattering ( i.e. , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath9 ) at a given time . in general , three cases should be considered .",
    "case ( 1 ) : the dust layer is in the form of an intervening galaxy , which is also at a cosmological distance .",
    "thus , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mean energy of the x - ray photons , @xmath25 mpc , and @xmath26 are assumed . this x - ray echo can be much brighter than any intrinsic emission from the intervening galaxy @xcite .",
    "however it is below the xrt detection limit ( @xmath27 for a @xmath28 s integration time ) of _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "case ( 2 ) : the dust scattering happens at low latitudes or in dense clouds of our galaxy , which have been verified by observations .",
    "we can get a similar expression for the total flux of the echo @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 pc , and @xmath33 are assumed @xcite .",
    "the typical halo radius is about @xmath34 .",
    "this echo feature is quite detectable and consistent with observations ( vaughan et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) . due to the large halo radius",
    ", this case can be easily distinguished by observational analysis @xcite .",
    "case ( 3 ) : if the dust scattering happens in the host galaxy of a grb at redshift @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 pc , and @xmath39 are assumed . this case is similar to case ( 2 ) , and thus the echo emission is significantly detectable , since both cases have a similar scattering geometry , except that the halo in case ( 3 ) has a very small angular size and can not be resolved on earth .",
    "obviously such a bright flux is quite comparable to those of normal x - ray afterglows ( e.g. costa 1999 ) .",
    "we need to give a further consideration of this echo component , which may have been observed but not realized so far . in general",
    ", only the total flux of the echo emission versus time needs to be considered , due to its small angular size .",
    "here , we revisit the temporal behavior of an x - ray echo event with a delayed time of minutes to days ( e.g. mszros & gruzinov 2000 ; sazonov & sunyaev 2003 ) . for this purpose , we need to know the differential cross section for the small - angle scattering of x - rays off dust grains . for typical spherical grains of radius @xmath14 , in the limit of @xmath40",
    "the exact mie solution recovers the rayleigh - gans approximation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total cross section , @xmath11 is the wavelength of the x - ray photons , @xmath43 is the scaled angular coordinate , @xmath44 is the scattering angle , and @xmath45 is the first - order spherical bessel function @xcite . for simplicity , our treatment takes the dust grains as rayleigh - gans particles ( e.g. krgel 2003 ) and is independent of the chemical composition or shape of the grains , as long as equation ( 7 ) holds .      for a variable x - ray source ( e.g. the prompt x - ray counterpart of a grb ) at an angular diameter distance @xmath3 , with an unabsorbed flux as a function of time , @xmath46 , scattered by an intervening dust layer ( which could be assumed to be in the host galaxy of a grb with an angular diameter distance @xmath9 from the grb ) at an angular diameter distance @xmath5 with a scattering optical depth @xmath47 , the observed intensity @xmath48 of the x - ray echo is calculated by @xmath49 where @xmath6 is given by equation ( 1 ) , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52",
    "are used in the small - angle limit , @xmath11 is the mean wavelength of x - ray photons in the dust frame , @xmath47 is assumed to be small , and the light that multiply scatters into the line of sight is ignored .    at first , for simplicity , we assume that @xmath53 does not vary with @xmath7 and @xmath54 based on the fact that the dust layer may have a small thickness ( vaughan et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) . for a bursting source ,",
    "most of its energy is assumed to be emitted in a narrow band on a time much shorter than @xmath6 , and the flux is then approximated as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the dirac delta function and the source s trigger time is taken as the time zero point .",
    "it follows from equation ( 9 ) that the total flux of the echo is analytically expressed as @xmath57\\}\\hat{\\theta}(t)\\over \\lambda d_{ds}\\hat{x}[\\hat{\\theta}(t)]t}\\,,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 .",
    "some formulae are given in the appendix for translating the dirac delta function of @xmath62 into a function of @xmath7 .",
    "this temporal behavior is illustrated in figure 2 with the dot - dashed line .",
    "the dust layer is assumed to be in the host galaxy , and we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 in figure 2 .",
    "studies of interstellar extinction indicate that most of the grains have a size near @xmath66 and a distribution in a wide range @xcite . here",
    "we choose @xmath67 for a simple illustration .",
    "the x - rays in the range @xmath68 can be scattered most efficiently @xcite , and thus the average photon energy @xmath69 is used .",
    "the total x - ray fluence @xmath70 in the energy band from about 2 to 10 kev is given .",
    "the mean scattering optical depth @xmath71 is assumed in figure 2 , although @xmath72 is expected to be dependent on the photon energy ( e. g. mszros & gruzinov 2000 ; we account for this below ) .",
    "note that in the x - ray scattering scenario , the size of the interstellar dust grains is generally larger than the wavelength of the x - rays . as very big particles block practically all light that falls onto them , most of the scattered photons substantially originate from diffraction at their edges .",
    "the diffraction of x - rays through a dust layer causes an interferometric pattern in the differential cross section as a function of the scattering angle , as given in equation ( 8) , only if equation ( 7 ) holds ( e.g. krgel 2003 ) .",
    "this translates into the pattern of total flux versus time , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the significant semi - periodic interferometric pattern indicated in these light curves reminds one of the x - ray light curve observed in some long grbs , e.g. , grb 050904 @xcite .",
    "of course , this pattern may be smoothed out in some other realistic situation , when there is a range of dust grain sizes and the total flux is detected in a finite x - ray band ( e.g. @xmath73 kev for xrt ) .",
    "this is treated in some detail in the following subsection .",
    "the shallow decay phase shown in the light curve , which is common in the small - angle scattering scenario predicted by equation ( 3 ) , can actually be attributed to the first maximum in the differential cross section peaking at a very small scattering angle , with the scaled notation @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section decreases dramatically at @xmath75 @xcite , which is translated into the decaying total flux at @xmath76 .",
    "after that , a fast power - law decay of the maxima ( roughly @xmath77 ) emerges .",
    "regardless , the small - angle approximation used here ( i.e. @xmath78 ) is not violated throughout the whole light curve , since the scattering angle @xmath79 is no more than several arcminutes at a delayed time @xmath80 s , with @xmath38 pc .",
    "furthermore , we also consider the scattering of a constant x - ray beam emitted by the source within a time range @xmath81 , i.e. , the flux is approximated as @xmath82 .",
    "the received flux can be calculated by integrating equation ( 9 ) over @xmath7 and @xmath54 .",
    "the results with different @xmath81 are also shown in figure 2 . the on - going flux @xmath83 is given , and the other parameters are not changed .",
    "the light curves due to scattering of a beam are similar to those of a pulse , except that an early rise is expected in the former case .      above we assume a constant scattering optical depth @xmath72 , a grain size @xmath14 , and a homochromous initial fluence @xmath10 . in some cases",
    ", @xmath84 may vary as the x - ray energy @xmath24 changes , and the grain size may have a certain distribution .",
    "for the rayleigh - gans approximation , the total scattering cross section @xmath85 is also inferred ( e.g. mauche & gorenstein 1986 ) , and it is suggested by observations that @xmath86 @xcite . here , in our treatment with only small scattering optical depth ( @xmath87 ) , we assume that @xmath88 where @xmath89|_{a_-}^{a_+}$ ] is a constant in units of @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the scattering optical depth at 1 kev , @xmath92 , @xmath93 m , and @xmath94 m are inferred from observations @xcite . here @xmath95 is inferred from a single observation @xcite and then adopted by mszros & gruzinov ( 2000 ) .    an initial source spectrum should also be taken into account . in the soft x - ray band , this is given by the band spectrum @xcite @xmath96,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is a parameter in units of @xmath98 , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 kev are suggested by preece et al .",
    "thus , we can calculate the measured flux , e.g. , in the @xmath73 kev band by xrt .",
    "consequently , @xmath101\\}\\hat{\\theta}(t)\\over \\lambda d_{ds}\\hat{x}[\\hat{\\theta}(t)]t}\\left({\\epsilon\\over{100\\,{\\rm kev}}}\\right)^\\delta { \\rm exp}\\left[-{(\\delta+1)\\epsilon\\over e_p}\\right]{\\rm d}a{\\rm d}\\epsilon\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the unabsorbed initial emission is still taken to be a pulse of light , approximately as in equation ( 10 ) . in the case of a beam of light , the difference in the echo light curve is the short rising time at the beginning time ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "equation ( 13 ) can be evaluated numerically with different parameters considered .",
    "we find that the temporal behavior of @xmath102 significantly depends on three observable quantities of dust grains .",
    "the first quantity is the position of dust @xmath9 .",
    "this is because @xmath6 depends prominently on the position of the dust , which is inferred from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the second quantity is the maximal size of a dust grain , @xmath103 , which is the large - size cutoff for the size distribution .",
    "the third quantity is the index @xmath104 in the dependence of dust - scattering optical depth on x - ray energy .",
    "one prominent characteristic of this temporal behavior is a distinguishable broken power law , with a break time dependent on the parameters discussed above . as shown in figure 3 , a shallow decay before the break and a slope @xmath105 after the break are clearly present in the light curves .",
    "the shallow decay before the break is expected from our previous discussion and roughly consistent with our estimates of small - angle scattering , shown by equation ( 3 ) , while the steep decay after the break can be attributed to the quickly decreasing cross section of larger angle scattering at later times .",
    "this feature of the flux ( @xmath77 ) is also implied in the previous discussion , e.g. , as shown in figure 2 , which is roughly consistent with the decreasing maxima .",
    "figure 4 plots the spectral evolution during dust scattering . in general ,",
    "the spectra soften as the flux decreases .",
    "the softening of the spectra can be attributed physically to the diffraction effect ( treated as scattering here ) which is described in the differential cross section versus scattering angle ( eq . [ 8 ] ) .",
    "softer x - rays tend to be scattered at a larger angle @xmath44 , with high - order maxima in the differential cross section , and are thus received at a larger angle @xmath7 , which leads to a longer arrival time due to a longer light distance ( eq . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "obviously , one can tell from figure 4 that the visible softening emerges at later time when the steep decay ( @xmath106 ) in the light curves shows up .",
    "this corresponds to a delayed time of @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the planck constant , and @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 are the equivalent average photon wavelength , energy , and dust radius , respectively .",
    "above , we revisit the x - ray scattering off dust grains at grb stages .",
    "now we apply these results to observational data and suggest that some of the x - ray afterglows detected so far may be alternatively explained as the emission from x - ray echoes , i.e. , dust - scattering  driven afterglows .",
    "\\1 . a shallow decay followed by a  normal \" decay and a further steepening",
    "is suggested by zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to be characteristic of almost all the @xmath112 grbs .",
    "( 1 ) in general , to account for shallow decay , a continuous activity of the grb progenitor is expected @xcite or a power law distribution of the lorentz factors in the ejecta is assumed @xcite . alternatively , we propose that this feature can be attributed to the x - ray echo emission at early times .",
    "( 2 ) to account for the steep decay after the  normal \" decay , the relativistic jet effect has been suggested @xcite .",
    "alternatively , this feature can be explained as the x - ray echo emission at late times .",
    "to summarize , the features with a shallow decay followed by a ",
    "normal \" decay and a further steepening are consistent with the x - ray echo emission presented above , e. g. , as shown in figure 3 .    here",
    ", we apply equation ( 13 ) to two recently detected grbs , 060813 and 060814 , in figure 5 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 kev are assumed .",
    "the consequent parameters are @xmath113 and @xmath114 pc for grb 060813 and @xmath115 and @xmath116 pc for grb 060814 .",
    "the other parameters , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath95 , are the same for the two grbs .",
    "obviously , a shallow decay is common in early x - ray afterglows .",
    "this favors the dust - scattering scenario , which predicts a shallow decay at an early time , when the scattering angle is smaller ( see also eq . [ 3 ] ) . in any case , the detailed light curve depends on several parameters that we mentioned in  3.2 , and thus the early temporal index varies in a wide range , e.g. , @xmath119 $ ] , and then steepens into @xmath120 $ ] at a moderate time ( see also fig .",
    "3 ) . of course",
    ", as the scattering angle gets larger at later times , a further steepening of the decay ( @xmath106 ) is also predicted in our calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the steep decay ( @xmath77 ) is not observed in most x - ray afterglows @xcite . in the latter case , it may be due to a larger @xmath9 , which means that an echo event with a small scattering angle will take place with a longer duration , so that the shallow decay component will last a longer time , thereby preventing the emergence of a steep decay .",
    "most early x - ray light curves are found to decline rapidly in the first few minutes , with a power - law index of @xmath121 or greater @xcite . in general , this feature can be taken as a grb tail emission arising from high angular latitudes @xcite .",
    "then a break to a shallower decay component , as mentioned above , commonly shows up , which is defined as an x - ray hump by @xcite .",
    "early xrt data reveal little evidence of spectral evolution across this temporal break , but where evolution is seen , the spectrum tends to get harder @xcite .",
    "provided that the  hump \" component is explained as the x - ray echo emission , this spectral feature is basically consistent with our expectation .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , the early - time spectrum of echo emission in soft x - rays would hardly change from the initial prompt spectrum .",
    "given an intrinsic evolution of the prompt spectrum , the delayed echo spectrum can be harder than the contemporaneous tail emission in the observer s frame .",
    "our model predicts that a visible spectral evolution in xrt is expected when the steep decay phase ( @xmath106 ) emerges .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the rayleigh - gans approximation is adopted here in calculating the differential cross section .",
    "this approximation works pretty well for normal interstellar dust and energies at or above 2 kev .",
    "however , it overestimates the echo emission at lower energies @xcite , where absorption of soft x - rays is important .",
    "this absorption effect will weaken the low - energy component in the spectra .",
    "thus , the spectral shapes , as shown in figure 4 , have been idealized in our treatment .",
    "regardless , a softening spectrum is expected when the steep decay phase ( @xmath106 ) emerges .",
    "this feature needs to be verified by time - resolved spectral analysis , in case the steep decay phase does emerge .",
    "fluctuations or flares are observed in some grbs ( e.g. grb 050904 : watson et al .",
    "2006 , cusumano et al .",
    "2006 ; xrf 050406 : romano et al . 2006a ; grb 060713a : guetta et al .",
    "generally these flares are thought to be caused by late internal shocks , similar to those that produce the prompt emission ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; burrows et al . 2005b ; fan & wei 2005 ; wu et al .",
    "2005 ; perna et al .",
    "2005 ; liang et al .",
    "2006 ) , or late external shocks @xcite .",
    "both the late internal shock model and late external shock model require late - time activities of central engines @xcite .    alternatively , we have three reasons suggesting that these flares , or some of them , might be due to dust - scattering :    \\1 .",
    "enormous flares are also observed in some grbs ( e.g. grb 050502b : burrows et al .",
    "2005a ; falcone et al . 2006 ) , which requires a more complicated theoretical explanation .",
    "however , these flares usually begin with an excess absorbing column that softens as the flare progresses . in addition , the afterglow intensity and slope are similar before and after the flare @xcite .",
    "these features seem to favor the dust - scattering scenario , which does not disturb anything when it turns off .",
    "the softening feature emerges when it turns on",
    "semi - periodic fluctuations are revealed in some grbs ( e.g. grb 050904 : watson et al .",
    "2006 , cusumano et al . 2006",
    "; grb 050730 : burrows et al .",
    "2005b ) , which reminds one of the interferometric pattern expected in the dust - scattering scenario under certain assumptions .",
    "although this feature may always be smoothed out in practical cases ( see @xmath2 3 ) , one can see a hint of the physics this may have unearthed .",
    "otherwise , if the dust layer is broken up or distorted by the grb progenitor or is fluffy , as in some cases with many holes and voids @xcite , flares should also be expected in the echo light curves .",
    "for example , a big jump in @xmath122 around @xmath123 causes a rapid rise and a rapid decay around @xmath124 due to the time delay of the scattered flux introduced in equation ( 9 ) , where @xmath125 is the angular scale from the grb source of the fluctuation of the dust intensity in the host galaxy . in any case , we may be able to discover whether these flares are due to dust scattering , after improving our model with specific dust details .",
    "in this paper , we revisit the x - ray dust scattering in grbs .",
    "first , we give an estimate of the emerging flux during such an x - ray echo event , which is expected to be dominant in x - ray afterglows .",
    "we find that an initial pulse of x - rays from a normal grb scattering off dust grains in the host galaxy can be followed by a long - term  afterglow \" with almost the same amount of energy as expected in the grb x - ray afterglows .",
    "second , we investigate the behaviors of such an event , especially its light curves . we find that some of these features are also consistent with observations of grb x - ray afterglows .",
    "we suggest that some of the x - ray afterglows from grbs ( especially those without sharp rising and decaying flares ) can be understood in the dust - scattering  driven afterglow model .",
    "the scattering of the prompt x - ray emission from grbs off the host dusty regions can be an alternative explanation for most of the features observed recently in x - ray afterglows by _ swift _ xrt .",
    "several properties of dust grains ( e. g. , @xmath126 , and @xmath104 ) are supposed to be relevant for temporal behaviors of x - ray echoes .",
    "the most deterministic one is the position of dust ( i.e. @xmath9 ) , because it determines the time delay @xmath6 given in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "however , until now , we have not known this quantity very well .",
    "reichart ( 2001 ) assumed that there is a preburst , dense environment due to the strong winds of grb progenitors with an inner radius of about several parsecs , while madau et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and moran & reichart ( 2005 ) suggested that this radius may be about 0.0010.01 pc .",
    "mszros & gruzinov ( 2000 ) and sazonov & sunyaev ( 2003 ) assumed a grb origin at the center of a uniform dusty region with a radius of about 10100 pc .",
    "in addition , the situation could be more complicated , with the evolution of the dust grain population considered .",
    "waxman & draine ( 2000 ) suggested that dust grains will be sublimated by the optical / uv flash of grbs out to a distance of about several parsecs ( see also perna & loeb 1998 ; lazzati et al .",
    "2001 ; perna & lazzati 2002 ; heng et al .",
    "recently , campana et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested a distance of several parsecs by analyzing the evolution of the soft x - ray absorbing column around grb 050904 .",
    "here , we find that a @xmath127 of @xmath128 tens of parsecs is consistent with _ swift _",
    "grbs , based on our dust - scattering  driven afterglow model .",
    "it should be noted that x - ray echo emission is proposed here to be due to dust scattering taking place at a distance of @xmath128tens of parsecs from the grb source .",
    "however , in the standard external - shock model , relativistic shocks generally take place up to a distance of @xmath129 cm .",
    "so technically this echo scenario does not rule out the existence of emission from external shocks in both x - ray and optical / nir bands .",

    "thus , there will be at least two types of x - ray afterglows if the external - shock model and the dust - scattering model are both valid .",

    "<S> the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have commonly been assumed to be due to shocks sweeping up the circum - stellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> however , most grbs have been found in dense star - forming regions where a significant fraction of the prompt x - ray emission can be scattered by dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> here we revisit the behavior of dust scattering of x - rays in grbs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the features of some x - ray afterglows from minutes to days after the gamma - ray triggers are consistent with the scattering of prompt x - ray emission from grbs off host dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that some of the observed x - ray afterglows ( especially those without sharp rising and decaying flares ) could be understood with a dust - scattering  driven emission model . </S>"
