    "in the first case the systems were first equilibrated in the absence of an external potential . after equilibrium was reached , the external potential was switched on and the system was again allowed to equilibrate until a dynamical steady state evolved . in the second case a system with a fully developed dynamical steady state at @xmath78 and @xmath79 was used as initial configuration .",

    "we focus on the angular distribution of the particle orientation vectors @xmath11 and on the height @xmath80 and orientation @xmath81 of the peak with the highest intensity of this distribution . for a nematic phase this height",
    "would be closely linked to the order parameter , while the orientation would correspond to the nematic director .",
    "+ as the time independent part of the external potential @xmath82 ensures that the orientation of the peak lies in the equatorial plane , i.e. , @xmath83 , we can reduce this evaluation to tracking the azimuthal angle @xmath84 of the peak orientation .",
    "furthermore , we average the angular distribution over the two representatives @xmath11 and @xmath53 of the particle orientation .",

    "[ fig : statesnem]a ) , the individual particles are able to rotate at the same frequency as the external field . for the angular distribution this results in a nematic peak with constant intensity @xmath80 .",
    "however , the phase difference @xmath88 is larger in the many - particle system than the phase shift expected for an isolated particle according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) , since particle - particle interactions provide an additional source of friction .",
    "as the peak is dragged behind @xmath30 at a constant phase shift @xmath89 , this state is called towing  @xcite .      upon increasing",
    "the driving frequency particle - particle interactions make it impossible for some particles to follow the external potential as they hinder each other in their turning . as they get left behind , the intensity @xmath80 of the peak decreases and @xmath89 increases slightly ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : statesnem]b ) .",
    "if @xmath61 of the stray particles becomes larger than @xmath90 they are attracted to the subsequent potential minimum and change their turning direction .",
    "when they are overtaken by the potential minimum at @xmath91 they again reverse their rotation direction and are collected into the peak at @xmath92 . as",
    "this peak is equivalent to the one at @xmath84 , as mentioned above , this leads to a re - increase in @xmath80 and a decrease in @xmath89 . due to this periodic change in @xmath80 and",
    "@xmath89 this state is called breathing .",
    "the breathing frequency itself is larger than @xmath51 and increases slightly with increasing driving frequency .      with further increase in the external rotation frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig : statesnem]c ) the spherocylinders have less and less time to rearrange amongst each other",
    ". thus their orientations lag further and further behind @xmath30 and with them the peak orientation @xmath84 . if @xmath51 surpasses a certain value , @xmath89 becomes larger than @xmath64 .",
    "thus the torque on the majority of the particles starts to decrease ( see eq .",
    "[ torque ] ) which leads to an even faster increase in @xmath89 . at the same time those particles that broke away from the main peak first",
    "are overtaken by the potential minimum at @xmath91 like in the breathing case .",
    "the torque on them increases until at some phase shift @xmath93\\pi,\\pi+\\pi/4\\right[$ ] , which is equivalent to a phase shift of @xmath930,\\pi/4\\right[$ ] , they experience a stronger torque than those particles constituting the original peak at its current @xmath94\\pi/4,\\pi/2\\right[$ ] .",
    "thus they become no longer integrated into the main peak , but instead give rise to the formation of a second peak while the original peak continues to drop in intensity . as we track the orientation of the peak with the highest intensity",
    ", we see a discontinuity in @xmath84 when the newly formed peak surpasses the old one in intensity .",
    "this state is called splitting due to the fact that there is no longer only one peak on each hemisphere but two .      for even higher frequencies",
    "the modulus of the jump in azimuthal angle from the decaying peak to the one originating from particles left behind becomes smaller than @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : statesnem]d ) .",
    "the reason for this is that with increasing @xmath51 the phase shift @xmath89 increases faster while at the same time particles that lag even further behind no longer have time to reorient very far before they are dragged again by the potential minimum at @xmath91 . following ref .",
    "the branches of @xmath84 in both fig .",
    "[ fig : statesnem]c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : statesnem]d ) can each be combined to a unique function @xmath95 such that the modulus of the jumping angle is always smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "this would make the splitting state correspond to a peak jumping forwards , while in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : statesnem]d ) the peak in the angular distribution is overtaken by the potential minimum once during each breathing cycle of @xmath80 hence the name overtaking .      finally , above a certain frequency",
    "@xmath51 , we again observe only one peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : statesnem]e ) . here",
    "the orientation of the majority of the particles falls rather quickly behind @xmath30 .",
    "as soon as @xmath89 becomes larger than @xmath64 the aligning torque on the main part of the spherocylinders decreases leading to a broadening of the peak accompanied by a drop in intensity @xmath80 . as in the cases above",
    ", particles that gain a @xmath61 larger than @xmath90 are attracted to the minimum at @xmath91 and change their turning directions .",
    "but before they become fully separated from the main peak , @xmath89 itself becomes larger than @xmath90 .",
    "thus the whole peak starts to turn in the opposite direction as the external potential . at the same time those particles with the largest @xmath61 , i.e. , those that are overtaken by the potential minimum at @xmath91 , again change their turning direction and are pushed back towards the peak leading to a re - increase in @xmath80 .",
    "when the peak itself is overtaken by the potential minimum at @xmath91 it too reverses its turning direction . while the peak is dragged by the external potential it collects those particles with @xmath96 gaining further in intensity @xmath80 until above @xmath97 the process repeats itself . as there is now only one peak that is periodically overtaken by the preferred direction of alignment this state is known as unsplit and overtaking .      in the low density regime we observe three dynamical states that are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : statesparanem ] .    .",
    "symbols as in fig .",
    "[ fig : statesnem][fig : statesparanem ] ]      at low frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : statesparanem]a ) , we find again the behavior described above as towing . here",
    "the difference between @xmath89 and the phase shift in the isolated particle case is not as prominent as in the high particle density regime as particle - particle interactions are less dominant .      for intermediate driving frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : statesparanem]b ) the system develops a dynamical breathing state that corresponds qualitatively to the one observed for higher packing fractions .",
    "however , as the inter - particle interactions are less pronounced than at high particle densities the transition between towing and breathing occurs at higher driving frequencies than in the denser packed system .",
    "additionally this results in both a lower peak intensity and a lower breathing amplitude than in fig .",
    "[ fig : statesnem]b ) .      at frequencies beyond the critical frequency",
    "the individual particles can not follow @xmath30 .",
    "their orientations are rather isotropically distributed in @xmath47 as the system is driven towards the paranematic state .",
    "the peak visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : statesparanem]c ) arises from those particles that have a @xmath61 of close to @xmath64 towards the current orientation of @xmath30 and thus feel a stronger torque than the other particles .",
    "they start to rotate with the external potential until friction becomes dominant , contributing for that time to a peak in the angular distribution that is following @xmath30 .",
    "this is a rather subtle effect as can be seen by the strong noise in @xmath89 and the intensity scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : statesparanem]c ) in comparison to fig .",
    "[ fig : statesparanem]a ) .",
    "we expect the peak intensity to continuously decrease further with increasing @xmath51 until it vanishes for @xmath68 in the paranematic state . to discriminate this purely collective soliton - like phenomenon from the synchronized turning of individual particles we call it towing  .",
    "+      our findings are summed up in the nonequilibrium state diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyndiagram ] .",
    "the dashed lines separating different states are a guide for the eye .",
    "the closer the system s parameters are to these boundaries the harder it is to classify its state unambiguously as it switches back and forth between neighboring states .",
    "we attribute this to the finite size of the system . the states given in fig .  [",
    "fig : dyndiagram ] correspond to the predominant state for each point in @xmath77 and @xmath51 .     in units of the critical frequency @xmath63 and reduced particle density @xmath77 .",
    "dashed lines serve as guide for the eye . for descriptions of states",
    "see text.[fig : dyndiagram ] ]     + if we compare the dynamical state digram to the one calculated by dynamical fundamental measure density - functional theory by hrtel et al .",
    "@xcite , we find a very good qualitative agreement at high densities .",
    "there we observe the same states in identical order .",
    "however , for the low density regime we are able to discriminate between two distinct kinds of towing with a breathing transition regime between them where density - functional theory only observes towing .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that it is impossible to distinguish between single particle rotation ( towing ) and the rotation of the director based on soliton - like dynamics ( towing  ) in density - functional theory .",
    "+ in a quantitative comparison , we find that the frequency band in which the different states emerge is considerably broader and lies at far lower frequencies than reported by hrtel et al .",
    "part of this discrepancy could be due to inertial effects as these have been reported to influence the boundaries between states  @xcite .",
    "clearly , in our langevin dynamics simulation inertia plays a non - negligible role , although we tried to minimize it ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] ) , while in ref .",
    "the spherocylinders are assumed to perform a completely overdamped brownian motion . on the other hand , hrtel et al .",
    "observe even for the high density systems that the towing regime extends to more than five times the critical frequency @xmath63 .",
    "this is in direct contrast to our findings that already below the critical frequency towing is not possible due to particle interactions .",
    "even more so it is in disagreement with the single particle assessment ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : single ] ) according to which towing is prohibited for frequencies above the critical frequency . in dynamical density",
    "functional theory , the approximation is made that the two - particle distribution function in a non - equilibrium system is equal to the equilibrium one for the same density profile . in our system , particles collide more often with each other due to the time - dependent external torques than they would in a system with a time - independent external field . as a result ,",
    "the positional dependence of the two - particle distribution function should change compared to the equilibrium result at the same density profile and the assumption made in ddft can not be expected to hold .",
    "therefore , it is surprising that the ddft does correctly predicts which phases appear in this system .",
    "we have simulated the behavior of a model colloidal liquid crystal consisting of hard spherocylinders under the influence of a periodic external potential that turns in a plane and acts on the orientation of the individual particles .",
    "we observe six different dynamical states that depend on the packing fraction of the particles and on the frequency of the external potential at fixed potential strength .",
    "these states have been categorized by the characteristic behavior of the angular distribution of the particle orientations as towing , towing ii , breathing , splitting , overtaking , and unsplit and overtaking .",
    "+ at high packing fractions we find the same states as density - functional theory  @xcite . however , we observe a broad frequency range in which the dynamical states are found in contrast to the predictions of ref .  .",
    "moreover , we are able to distinguish between two distinct types of towing with an intermediate breathing regime at low packing fractions , which have both not been reported by density - functional theory .",
    "the quantitative comparison leads us to the conclusion that with langevin dynamics simulation we are able to provide a more reliable assessment of the state boundaries than given in previous studies .",
    "+ we have analyzed the dynamical states we observe in detail and have given a thorough description from the single particle behavior point of view thereby explaining the underlying mechanisms that lead to the formation of those states .",
    "the towing behavior observed at low driving frequencies is a state in which the rotation of each particle is synchronized with the external potential as observed for isolated particles  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical states developing for higher frequencies originate from the interplay of the torque due to the external potential , friction with the fluid and particle - particle interactions . here",
    "individual particles exhibit a periodic reversal of their turning direction , also seen for isolated particles at high frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of particles that turn against the field which increases with both driving frequency and packing fraction ( i.e. particle - particle interactions ) determines the individual state .",
