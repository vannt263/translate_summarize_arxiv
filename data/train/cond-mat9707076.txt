    "<S> we present a model that explains two phenomena , recently observed in high - mobility si - mos structures : ( 1 ) the strong enhancement of metallic conduction at low temperatures , @xmath0  k , and ( 2 ) the occurrence of the metal - insulator transition in 2d electron system . </S>",
    "<S> both effects are prescribed to the spin - orbit interaction anomalously enhanced by the broken inversion symmetry of the confining potential well .    </S>",
    "<S> * introduction . * recently , in experiments with high mobility si - mos structures , a strong drop in resistivity @xmath1 has been found @xcite as temperature decreases below @xmath2  k. this effect is evidently in disagreement with the conventional interpretation of the one - parameter scaling theory ( opst ) @xcite , according to which all states in 2d system at zero magnetic field should be localized in the limit of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent scaling analysis of the temperature and electric field dependencies of the conductivity @xcite has revealed a critical behavior , typical for the metal - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> finally , convincing evidence for the existence of the extended states in 2d system at zero field has been obtained in experiments _ in magnetic field _ , in studies of the quantum hall effect to insulator transitions @xcite . the extended states which in high magnetic field are located in the centre of the corresponding landau bands , at decreasing field were found to remain in a finite energy range , giving rise to a mobility edge .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results thus suggest the existence of a true metallic state and of the metal - insulator ( m - i ) transition in 2 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in apparent contradiction with the conventional opst , and the origin of the metallic state remains puzzling . in this work , both experimental findings are explained as a consequence of the spin - orbit interaction enhanced by the broken inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the suggested model provides a good agreement with the experimental data on the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> * analysis of the experimental results . * </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows a set of the curves @xmath4 vs @xmath5 typical for the high - mobility samples @xcite , at different electron densities @xmath6 . at @xmath7  </S>",
    "<S> k , the resistivity , @xmath4 , increases slowly as temperature decreases , the latter is characteristic for the weakly localized regime . at lower temperature </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath4 drops sharply for all curves belonging to the `` metallic '' range of densities , @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the resistance drop is observed at densities in the range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . the critical density , @xmath9 is sample dependent and is equal to @xmath11  @xmath12 for the sample shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the drop in @xmath13 diminishes with decreasing sample mobility , and is almost replaced by a conventional rise in @xmath4 at @xmath3 in the sample with 8 times lower mobility , @xmath14 @xmath15/vs . </S>",
    "<S> the latter behavior is consistent with that reported in earlier studies on low - mobility samples @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * empirical fit of the data . * the @xmath13- curves in fig .  1 may be fitted well by an empirical dependence which summarizes the scattering probabilities of two processes :    @xmath16    the first term is independent of temperature , while the second one describes a scattering through an energy gap , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the curves shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 by thick continuous lines were obtained using two fitting parameters for each density , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> * possible microscopic mechanisms . * as seen from fig .  1 , the characteristic temperature , @xmath19 , is of the order of @xmath20 k in high mobility samples . searching for a proper microscopic mechanism , we find two small energy gaps intrinsic to si - mos structures at @xmath21 :  the valley splitting @xmath22 k and the zero - field spin - gap @xmath23 k @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it seems attractive to link the resistance drop to the transitions between the two electron valleys , located close to the x - points in the brillouin zone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the intervalley `` um - klapp '' scattering would hardly occur , since it requires a combination of the reciprocal lattice vectors of the very high order . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the phonon - induced intervalley transition would require participation of high energy phonons , @xmath24k , and is therefore unlikely at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> electron tunneling , as the intervalley transition mechanism , would not lead to a strong temperature dependence of scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> * spin - orbit splitting and interaction effects . * in the one - electron approximation , the spin - orbit interaction is described by the hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath25 { \\bf \\sigma},\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the momentum and spin operators , correspondingly . for the 2d electron system in si </S>",
    "<S> , the contribution of the bulk crystal potential in @xmath28 is small ( @xmath29 ) , and the lack of inversion symmetry of the triangular confining potential @xmath30 plays the major role .    </S>",
    "<S> this lifts the spin - degeneracy at zero magnetic field , and leads to the appearance of a linear term in the energy spectrum of 2d electrons @xcite :    @xmath31    the corresponding spin - gap    @xmath32    can be viewed as the difference in energy for the electron states with spin directed in the plane but to the left and right side with respect to @xmath33 , or , equivalently , along and opposite to the effective magnetic field @xmath34 $ ] in the frame related to electrons moving in 2d plane with fermi velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the empirically determined energy gap , @xmath35 originates from @xmath36 , and is equal to @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 ) , whereas the temperature independent contribution to the resistivity , @xmath39 , is related to the spin - independent scattering . </S>",
    "<S> finite quantum relaxation time @xmath40  and the corresponding level broadening @xmath41   should reduce the effective gap :    @xmath42    * comparison of the model with the experimental results . * </S>",
    "<S> the spin splitting @xmath43  k for the same si - mos structures was determined from the magnitude of the quantum oscillations of the chemical potential @xcite , extrapolated to zero field . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , that this value corresponds to @xmath44 . with this result </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath45kcm and the total energy spectrum becomes known .    in order to estimate </S>",
    "<S> the quantum level broadening , @xmath46 , the temperature dependence of the diagonal resistance was measured in the quantum hall effect regime with fermi energy adjusted to the zeeman energy gap at @xmath47 in the field of @xmath48 t. as a result , we have obtained an estimate , @xmath49 k for @xmath50@xmath12 ( here we presumed the gaussian level broadening and @xmath51 to be the full width ) . comparing the model effective energy gap , @xmath52 with the empirical value , @xmath53 k obtained in the fit at @xmath54 ( the 5th curve from the bottom in fig .  1 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we eventually find @xmath55 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the empirical energy gap , @xmath56 , decreases to zero at @xmath57 , as seen in fig .  1 . in the above model , </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) , this occurs because ( i ) the level broadening increases , @xmath58 and ( ii ) the spin splitting , @xmath59 , diminishes @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical fitting parameter @xmath51 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 vs electron density , rises indeed as density decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the total fit in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 is in surprisingly good agreement with the experimental data , despite the very simplified character of the above model .    </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath6 decreases and approaches @xmath9 , the resistance drop starts at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the weak decrease in @xmath13 noticeable at @xmath61 k is presumably due to the weak localization corrections @xmath62 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was ignored in the above model and the @xmath13 points corresponding to the negative @xmath63 were not fitted ; these points are connected by dashed lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows also two relaxation times : @xmath64 calculated from the mobility in the @xmath65 limit , and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that both @xmath67 and @xmath40 diminish almost linearly as density decreases ( but at @xmath8 ) and independently of each other . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum relaxation time @xmath64 provides the necessary resistivity value , @xmath68 at the critical density @xcite , whereas @xmath40 provides the effective spin - gap equal to 0 at @xmath69 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath64 _ decays faster and becomes smaller than _ @xmath40 with decreasing @xmath6 . at the critical density </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath70 is of the order of 0.1 m@xmath71/vs and @xmath72k , that corresponds to @xmath73s , and @xmath74s . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion on interception of the two curves , @xmath75 and @xmath76 is model independent , whereas the numerical values of @xmath77 and the interception point depend on the model chosen for level broadening . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the interception occurs at 11.5 or @xmath78 @xmath12 for gaussian or lorenzian broadening correspondingly .    </S>",
    "<S> * metal - insulator transition at @xmath79 : spin - orbit interaction and symmetry effects . * </S>",
    "<S> it is not only the low - temperature resistance drop but the total scaling behavior strongly depends on the symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding universality classes of the symmetry for random systems were established by dyson @xcite . in the presence of the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonal symmetry of the system is replaced by the symplectic symmetry . correspondingly , the level - repulsion exponent in the random matrix statistics @xcite changes from @xmath80 to @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> it appears therefore , that states are less easily localized in systems with large @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the spin - orbit interaction on weak localization was studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . for the strong localization regime , </S>",
    "<S> there have been suggestions @xcite that m - i transition can occur in the presence of a strong so interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling function in 2d was found to behaves asymptotically like @xmath83 in the high conductance limit @xmath84 , with @xmath85 in the orthogonal and @xmath86 in the symplectic case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath87-function in the symplectic case may thus become positive at sufficiently large @xmath88 . as disorder increases and conduction @xmath89 decreases </S>",
    "<S> , all states will be localized even in the symplectic case </S>",
    "<S> . the critical level of disorder and the critical conduction @xmath90 correspond to the point at which @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the symplectic @xmath92 function in 2d is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data presented in fig .  1 , in the vicinity of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> as temperature , or broadening increases , the energy relaxation time @xmath93 appears as a cut - off parameter and @xmath94 may become larger than the inverse spin relaxation time @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> . then the system would again behave as in the orthogonal symmetry case . </S>",
    "<S> the natural measure of the so interaction strength is the spin - orbit gap @xmath96 given by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , whereas as an estimate for disorder we adopted @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one may expect the m - i transition would manifest in those samples where   @xmath98 , which is also consistent with occurrence of the transition in the samples with peak mobility larger than 5000 @xmath15/vs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * discussion . </S>",
    "<S> * the above model explains why the resistance drop is seen only in low - disordered samples with large @xmath40-values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is dependent also on the symmetry of the potential well . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a key for testing the driving mechanism . as for other systems , the zero field spin - gap in gaas / al(ga)as is smaller by a factor of @xmath99 , due to the smaller @xmath100-factor value and much smaller @xmath101 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even in ideal samples with zero broadening , the resistance drop may occur at temperatures @xmath102 lower than those for the si - mos structures . in accord with this </S>",
    "<S> , no signatures of the resistance drop were revealed in recent measurements on gaas / al(ga)as heterojunctions at temperatures down to 20mk @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , there have been suggestions on other possible collective mechanisms , such as coulomb interaction @xcite , spin - triplet pairing @xcite , and non - fermi - liquid behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the corresponding models are not developed yet to provide a comparison with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> * summary . </S>",
    "<S> * it seems likely that the recently observed metal - insulator transition in high - mobility si - mos structures is the first experimental manifestation of the spin - orbit interaction induced transition in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the metallic conduction in these samples at low temperatures fits the same framework . </S>",
    "<S> strong so interaction energy relative to the level broadening , and broken inversion symmetry are favorable for the 2d metallic state . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction in this model provides the small level broadening at density down to @xmath9 . in the recent experiments @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the 2d metallic phase was found to be easily destroyed by the in - plane magnetic field ; this is a strong evidence for the spin - related origin of the 2d metal . </S>"
