    "the compact radio source sagittarius ( sgr ) a * , residing at the galactic center , is believed to be the best candidate of suppermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "based on observations of the orbiting stars , the mass of its central object is measured as over 4 million @xmath4 @xcite . however , it remains to be conclusively proved that sgr a * is a black hole , and the explanations of the broad - band emission are even controversial .",
    "various morphology of the emission region , torus , jet , and their combinations , are provided by different models .",
    "the observations at millimeter or longer wavelengths can not distinguish them due to the interstellar scattering .",
    "however , the interstellar scattering is becoming less severe as the observational wavelength decreases to millimeter band , so that the intrinsic size of sgr a * has been measured at 7 mm and 3 mm @xcite . according to the extrapolated scattering size , the intrinsic structure of sgr a * would be dominant , i.e. , the sub - millimeter vlbi promises to produce unadulterated images of its intrinsic structure .",
    "however , lack of baselines results in poor uv - coverage , making the imaging impossible .",
    "thus , theoretical modelling of sgr a * will be critical to both planning and interpreting sub - millimeter vlbi observaions @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported observations at 1.3 mm with a very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) array consisting of the arizona radio observatory sub - millimeter telescope ( smt ) , combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) , and james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "robust detections are obtained on baseline carma - smt at @xmath0 500 km and baseline jcmt - smt at @xmath0 4500 km .",
    "an upper limit is yielded on baseline carma - jcmt at @xmath0 3000 km .",
    "since these visibility measurements are too few to produce an image , a circular gaussian modelling results in a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath5 , with the scattering effects removed @xcite . however , also pointed out by them , this size is somewhat unexpected , because it is smaller than the black hole shadow size of @xmath6 regardless of the black hole spin @xcite .",
    "it might be possible that the emission really comes from the inside of black hole shadow .",
    "on the other hand , a structure with a central black hole shadow itself , deviating from the gaussian , might be implied by the visibility measurements .",
    "in this paper , we present a general relativistic accretion flow model with plasma wave heating mechanism ( sec.[mod ] ) .",
    "the polarization observations can be well explained with appropriate viewing angle and other model parameters set for arbitrary black hole spin .",
    "we then tend to use eight potential stations for future 1.3 mm vlbi measurements to perform visibility analysis ( sec.[cov ] ) .",
    "we perform a visibility analysis using eight potential stations for future 1.3 mm vlbi measurements .",
    "we test the images with recent 1.3 mm vlbi measurements and investigate the implications for the properties of the black hole and accetion flow ( sec.[vis ] ) .",
    "comparisons to the earlier work and evaluations on the potential @xmath7 coverage are given in the final section .",
    "we follow the magneto - rotational - instability ( mri ) driven accretion flow @xcite where the primary mechanism for generation of turbulence and viscous stress in accretion flows supported by magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations @xcite . when deriving the basic equations of the general relativistic accretion flow , we use the energy momentum tensor @xmath8 given as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the rest number density , four - velocity , heat - flux four - vector , viscous tensor , pressure , relativistic enthalpy , the mass of the proton and the mass of the electron , respectively .",
    "the basic equations for the relativistic hydrodynamics are then derived from the baryon - mass conservation @xmath18 , the energy - momentum conservation @xmath19 and an equation of state .",
    "detailed derivations can be found in @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the boyer - lindquist coordinate is used for the description of the kerr metric .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we introduce model parameters as the ratio of the total stress to the magnetic field energy density @xmath20 , the ratio of the magnetic field energy density to the gas pressure @xmath21 , dimensionless constant for electron heating rate @xmath22 , constant mass accretion rate @xmath23 , inclination angle @xmath24 , and position angle @xmath25 .",
    "an additional parameter of black hole spin @xmath26 is also introduced .",
    "the mean black hole mass of @xmath27 , measured from the orbit of the short - period star so-2 for the distance of @xmath28 kpc @xcite , is used .",
    "we adopt the simplified form for the viscous tensor component @xmath29 @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the lorentz factor , @xmath34 is the angular velocity of the accretion flow , and @xmath35 is the kinematic viscosity coefficient .",
    "we then assume the @xmath36-viscosity as @xmath37 where the product of @xmath20 and @xmath21 represents the @xmath36 coefficient .",
    "instead of assuming a keplerian accretion flow co - rotating with the central black hole as was done in previous work , we include the radial momentum conservation in the equation set .",
    "i.e. , at any radius , the radial velocity is solved by @xmath38 .",
    "the angular velocity is a little lower than the keplerian velocity outside about ten gravitational radii to the center .",
    "in small radii , the radial velocity increases significantly and the angular velocity becomes much lower than the keplerian velocity .",
    "the accreted plasma passes through a sonic point at a radius inside the innermost stable circular orbit , becomes super - sonic and finally crosses the event horizon of the black hole at a speed of light .",
    "we mention that we do nt consider the causality of the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "we also adopt the viscous tensor component derived from thin disk and the @xmath36-viscosity coefficient for simplicity .",
    "such treatments are enough to generate rough dynamical structure for the accretion flow , which can be used for observational predictions at 1.3 mm wavelength . for future observations at much shorter wavelengths and with higher resolution , causal viscosity should be calculated carefully to make more realistic images of the vicinity of the black hole .    here",
    ", the viscous heating rate is assumed to be equal to the turbulence cascade rate , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the magnetic field amplitude determined by the gas pressure and assumed @xmath21 , @xmath41 is the sound speed , and @xmath42 is the angular half - thickness of the disk .",
    "the radiative cooling is considered for electrons only and the viscous heating rate for electrons is assumed to be different from that for protons , and the radiative cooling for electrons is much more effective .",
    "we adopt the heating mechanism by turbulent plasma wave @xcite for electrons as @xmath43 , where the timescale @xmath44 , @xmath45 $ ] with @xmath46 as the @xmath24th order modified bessel function of dimensionless temperature @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the mean electron speed .",
    "therefore the energy equation for electrons becomes @xmath49 and the energy equation for both protons and electrons derived from local energy conservation @xmath50 is @xmath51 = \\gamma_{\\rm vis}^+ - \\lambda_{\\rm rad}^- , \\label{energyeqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the coulomb energy exchange rate between electrons and protons and @xmath53 is the radiative cooling rate calculated from the sum of the energy losses due to the synchrotron radiation , the synchrotron self - comptonization of the soft photons and the bremsstrahlung .",
    "the temperatures of protons and electrons can be solved with the eq.[energyeqn ] and eq.[energyeqne ] combined .",
    "the dynamical structure of the accretion flow is determined by solving all the physical quantities on the equatorial plane and the scale height from the outermost radius of @xmath54 schwarzschild radii to the event horizon .",
    "we assume homogeneous distribution in the vertical direction at any radius and a configuration of magnetic field to be parallel to the velocity field in the upper side of the accretion flow and reversed in the lower side , which forms from the initial field lines in vertical structure and the shearing of the keplerian accretion flow .",
    "considering synchrotron emission of only thermal population of electrons together with self - absorption and birefringence effects , full general relativistic radiative transfer along ray trajectories is then performed to give polarized images at any given frequency .",
    "corresponding equations can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model parameters are set in the following procedure .",
    "first of all , @xmath20 is fixed to be 0.7 when the turbulence saturates @xcite .",
    "secondly , the inclination angle @xmath24 is fixed to be @xmath55 as a typical value to reproduce high linear polarization in sub - millimeter band @xcite .",
    "the position angle @xmath25 is chosen as @xmath56 , which can make the accretion flow reproduce the observed position angle of electric vector ( evpa ) from millimeter to near - infrared band @xcite with the mean external rotation measure of @xmath57 adopted @xcite .",
    "next , we arbitrarily set a value for spin @xmath26 and choose an appropriate value for @xmath21 . in practice , if @xmath26 is set , @xmath21 should be small enough to keep very low circular polarizations in the sub - millimeter band reported by @xcite . finally , we adjust values for @xmath23 and @xmath22 and calculate the synchrotron radiation of thermal electrons to reproduce the linear polarization degree of @xmath58 in sub - millimeter band @xcite and overall spectrum from centimeter to near - infrared band , fixing the flux density at 1.3 mm to 2.4 jy . in practice ,",
    "the linear polarization is most sensitive to @xmath23 and the flux density is affected by the combination of @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we adopt @xmath59 , which can explain the polarization observations well , as our fiducial model , then choose three sets of model parameters corresponding to three different spins . in detail , those parameters are @xmath60 for a non - rotating black hole , @xmath61 for a mildly - rotating black hole , and @xmath62 for a fast - rotating black hole .",
    "we show the global solutions of the three cases in fig.[dynam ] and the spectra predicted by them in fig.[spec ] .",
    "the observed emission bump and high linear polarization degree in the sub - millimeter band are predicted by the accretion flow .",
    "another jet / outflow component @xcite , which is not shown in these figures , contributes to the emission and depolarization in millimeter and longer wavelengths . for the wavelength of 1.3 mm we are interested in",
    ", we assume the emission is dominated by the accretion flow and the jet / outflow component may produce a weak depolarization and a certain change in its evpa .",
    "we consider the following eight potential mm - vlbi stations to simulate the 1.3 mm vlbi observations in this paper : hawaii ( h ) , including jcmt and submillimeter array ( sma ) ; smto ( s ) ; carma ( c ) ; the large millimeter telescope ( lmt , l ) on sierra negra , mexico ; chilean station ( a ) , consisting of atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) and atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) ; the iram plateau de bure ( pdbi , p ) , france ; the iram pico veleta , spain ( pv , v ) ; and a proposed station locating on mount cook in new zealand ( mt - cook , m ) , one of the candidate positions for telescope establishment in the future . the @xmath7 coverage from these stations is shown in the top - left panel of fig.[uv ] .",
    "these stations offer a @xmath7 coverage in almost all the direction and various baseline lengths .",
    "however , it takes about 11 hours to complete these tracks due to earth rotation . here",
    "we divide the total observing time into six parts , with the interval of @xmath63hr . in fig.[uv ] , they are shown in square(black ) , cross(blue ) , triangle(magenta ) , circle(violet ) , rhombus(green ) , and plus(red ) symbols , respectively . from the beginning to the end . the @xmath7 coverage in the same or neighbour symbol ,",
    "is considered for a simultaneous observation .",
    "we choose three typical sub - coverages from the total observation .",
    "_ sub - coverage i _ is a sub - coverage during @xmath64hr ( ut ) , produced by the hawaii ( jcmt included ) , smto , and carma , shown in triangle and circle in the top - right panel of fig.[uv ] .",
    "this sub - coverage includes the coverage obtained in the observations by @xcite .",
    "_ sub - coverage ii _ is during @xmath65hr ( ut ) from all the stations considered , shown in cross and triangle in the bottom - left panel in fig.[uv ] . in this sub - coverage , a wide range of baseline length of @xmath66 in northwest - southeast direction",
    "is included .",
    "especially , lengths of @xmath67 are covered by baseline group ac / al / as . in almost its perpendicular direction , i.e. the northeast - southwest direction , comparable lengths are also covered by baselines ch , hs , and hl .",
    "simultaneous detections on both perpendicular directions are very important to determine the geometry of the assumed accretion flow , as shown in @xcite and as follows .",
    "_ sub - coverage iii _ is also from all the eight stations , but during @xmath68hr ( ut ) , shown in rhombus and plus in the bottom - right panel . in this sub - coverage ,",
    "a wide range of baseline length of @xmath69 in near east - west direction is covered by baselines cs , ch , hs , hl , and am .",
    "the baselines al , as , ac , ah , hm , cm , ms , and lm cover a wide range of directions apart from the east - west , but only in lengths of @xmath70 .",
    "for the fiducial model described in sec.[mod ] , with inclination angle @xmath71 , position angle @xmath72 , but with three different black hole spins , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , we convolve the images with the scattering ellipse .",
    "we adopt mean fwhms of the scattering screen of @xmath76 for the major angular size in milli - arc - second and @xmath77 for the minor one , and the orientation of @xmath78 for the major axis , which is derived from size measurements in centimeter band @xcite .",
    "we then perform 2-dimensional fourier transform with special @xmath7 coverage provided by those potential stations . with the sampling of _ sub - coverage i _ , the corresponding visibility profiles are shown in fig.[vispa ] . for each case , the scatter - broadened image is shown in the left . its black hole shadow structure is shown as a white region at the center .",
    "the dark - red region beside the shadow shows the accretion flow emission boosted by doppler effect .",
    "the predicted visibilities are shown in triangle and circle , with the @xmath7 coverage in @xcite included .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , sgr a * could be considered as observed in its quiescent state since it exhibited the total flux density lower than other measurements .",
    "these data can be compared with our predictions within 4 hours , although they were measured on two consecutive days .",
    "their measurements of total flux density , correlated flux density on baseline cs , and correlated flux density on baseline hs are marked by filled circle , filled square , and filled triangles , respectively .",
    "the upper limit on baseline ch is marked by a downward arrow .",
    "the models with @xmath73 and @xmath79 provide good explanations to the visibility measurements .",
    "notice that the predicted visibilities in triangle at baselines ch and hs , in similar directions , can not be fitted by a gaussian profile .",
    "clear structures of null point , or valley point , are predicted at @xmath80 , which are due to the existence of the black hole shadow @xcite .",
    "we note that this structure may be absent in a lot of cases ( see in the following ) . in our fiducial model , however , the appropriate lengths and directions make these two baselines , ch and hs , potential to detect the important structure , if better sensitivity can be achieved for carma .    when the black hole is assumed to be fast rotating , the predicted correlated flux densities on baselines ch and hs also increase .",
    "this is because that the emission region become more compact with large spin . when the black hole spin increases to @xmath75",
    ", the predicted visibilities on baseline ch nearly exceed the observed upper limit .",
    "furthermore , the structure of the valley point can not be recognized .",
    "the emission region becomes so compact and totally dominated by the blue - shifted side .",
    "therefore , for the fiducial model with @xmath59 , determined by polarization data , the 1.3 mm visibility measurements prefer a black hole spin parameter of @xmath81 .",
    "the fiducial model with a relatively mildly rotating black hole can reproduce recent 1.3 mm visibility measurements .",
    "the orientation of the accretion flow is constrained by polarization observations , based on the assumption of a large - scale magnetic field in toroidal configuration . however , this specific orientation is not conclusive without direct imaging . in spite of the polarizations ,",
    "the measurements on baselines ch and hs can be explained by many appropriate combinations of @xmath26 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , e.g. , highly - inclined disk with @xmath82 for relatively mild spin , or nearly face - on disk with any position angle and spin .",
    "our favorite parameters are relatively mildly - rotating black hole , mild inclination angle , and position angle toward southeast . on the other hand , any model in opposite parameters ,",
    "i.e. , nearly face - on , nearly egde - on , position angle toward northeast , or extremely high spin , can be an extreme alternative to our favorite model .",
    "we focus on the disk orientation , i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , first .",
    "choose one fiducial model with @xmath83 , and set three alternative cases with @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we sample the predicted visibilities with the _ sub - coverage ii _ mentioned in sec.[cov ] , which covers comparable baseline lengths in almost perpendicular directions by baseline groups",
    "ch / hl / hs and ac / al / as . in particular , baseline al can perform simultaneous observations with baseline hl at @xmath87 , and baselines al and as can perform quasi - simultaneous observations ( difference within 4 hours ) with baselines ch and hs at @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding visibilities are predicted in fig.[vispb1 ] , shown in cross and triangle .",
    "it can be found that the visibilities predicted by the two baseline groups make big differences among all the possible cases .",
    "we can divide the visibility results into three groups : group i , the predicted visibilities yielded by the two orthogonal baseline groups are comparable , e.g. , the case shown in the top - right panel ; group ii , the predicted visibilities yielded by ac / al / as are in higher correlated flux density compared to those yielded by ch / hl / hs , e.g. , cases in the left two panels ; group iii , opposite to group ii , e.g. , the case in the bottom - right panel",
    ". these observations are capable of determining the basic geometry of the intrinsic emission region of sgr a*. detailed discussions are as follows .    if the results in group i are obtained , the emission region is almost symmetrical to the east - west direction .",
    "it is probably the nearly face - on case , similar to that shown in the top - right panel of fig.[vispb1 ] .",
    "we show its visibilities by the total @xmath7 coverage in the left panel of fig.[vispb ] .",
    "in such a case , the visibilities show a similar profile , with a clear valley along all directions . baselines with appropriate length , @xmath89 in this case , in any direction , such as ch , hs , cl , al , have the potential to detect such structure .",
    "however , there are exceptions .",
    "cases with higher inclination angle can be included in group i , if the position angle is close to north or south .",
    "we show an example with @xmath90 in the right panel of fig.[vispb ] . in this case",
    ", the visibilities again show a similar profile along all directions , though for all the baselines we consider here the valley is missing .",
    "however , these profiles significantly deviate from gaussian profiles .    if the results in group ii are obtained , the nearly face - on cases are excluded , and the position angle is estimated ranging from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , or from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "the structure of valley point may be detected on baselines ch or hs at @xmath95 , except the highly - inclined cases , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "in general , for a given inclination angle , the differences in correlated flux density between ac / al / as and ch / hl / hs are predicted to reach maxima at @xmath97 .",
    "for a given position angle , such differences are predicted to be larger with a higher inclination angle .",
    "vlbi observations reported in @xcite are insufficient to produce a unique estimate of the disk orientation in this case",
    ". however , earth - aperture synthesis with additional vlbi stations may be able to do so .",
    "_ sub - coverage iii _ is complementary to _ sub - coverage ii _ because of the different directions it covers .",
    "we sample the predicted visibilities with the new sub - coverage for the two cases in left panels of fig.[vispb1 ] .",
    "we then make the same sampling for these two cases by changing their position angles into @xmath98 .",
    "predicted visibilities of all these four cases are shown in fig.[vispb4 ] .",
    "two baseline groups are considered , am / ch / hl / hs which provides coverage on near east - west directions , and ac / ah / al / as / cl / ls which provides coverage from northeast to northwest .",
    "these two baseline groups can perform simultaneous observations with comparable baseline lengths but significantly different directions . in particular ,",
    "baselines ls and cl track @xmath1 from baseline ch @xmath99 .",
    "baseline al tracks nearly perpendicular to baseline hl at @xmath87 . and am and as track nearly perpendicular to baseline am at @xmath100 . with a position angle close to @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 ) , e.g. , the two cases with @xmath72 , the visibilities yielded by the two baseline groups are predicted to be comparable at @xmath101 , while in larger difference with higher inclination angle at @xmath102 , i.e. between ac , as , hm , and am .",
    "if the position angle decreases from @xmath92 to @xmath103 ( or from @xmath93 to @xmath104 ) , e.g. , the two cases with @xmath105 , the visibilities yielded by group am / ch / hl / hs are predicted to become much lower than those yielded by group ac / ah / al / as / cl / ls . with higher inclination angle ,",
    "these differences become larger , in particular , between al and hl at @xmath106 , and between hm ( or as ) and am at @xmath107 . in addition , the valley structure , or deviation from gaussian may appear at baselines hl and hs at @xmath108 .    with the two sub - coverages discussed above",
    ", we may make an estimation with an error bar as small as @xmath109 of the position angle for an accretion flow of group ii .",
    "furthermore , an edge - on case may be easily recognized by visibilities at @xmath110 .",
    "cases in group iii are not preferred by the recent 1.3 mm measurements .",
    "those measurements have strictly constrained these cases with @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , so that we wo nt discuss more in this paper .",
    "of course , we can further use _ sub - coverage iii _ for confirmation .",
    "small values of black hole spin parameter are preferred by recent measurements . however , this is not conclusive because it is based on our fiducial model , with assumptions of specific electrons heating mechanism and magnetic field structure . in @xcite",
    ", we adopted the general radiatively inefficient accretion flow based on the work of @xcite and @xcite , and found the recent measurements prefer extremely high values of black hole spin , in stark contrast to the result in this paper .",
    "therefore , the spin parameter inferred from observational visibilities depends significantly upon the adopted model .",
    "given a specific model , the emission region becomes more compact with the increase of the black hole spin , so that the structure of the visibility valley , if present , moves towards longer baselines .",
    "what can be concluded from the visibility measurements is the basic geometry , e.g. , compactness , or asymmetry , of the emission region . however , determining the black hole spin from this is generally model - dependent .",
    "we show the images and predicted visibilities of two cases for the fiducial model adopted in this paper ( model a ) in the left column in fig.[vispbspin ] . for comparison ,",
    "two cases for the model adopted in @xcite ( model b ) with the same parameters of spin and orientation are shown in the right column .",
    "it is found that the emission region of model a with a non - rotating black hole is even more compact than that of model b with a fast - rotating black hole , e.g. , @xmath114 .",
    "notice the predicted visibilies on baseline ch and hs , in circle and triangle at @xmath115 . and the data of recent measurements .",
    "fast - rotating black hole is excluded by model a , but preferred by model b.    such a difference is mainly caused by the different electron heating mechanism used . in model a , the heating mechanism is dominated by turbulence in plasma wave .",
    "this heating mechanism is so effective that the electron temperature exceeds @xmath116k in the innermost region .",
    "the angular velocity of the accretion flow is close to the keplerian velocity , @xmath117 , outside the sonic point .",
    "the strong doppler boosting in the blue - shifted side makes the emission region more compact . in model b",
    ", the electrons are heated by a small fraction of the viscous heating .",
    "the electron temperature keeps lower than @xmath116k even near to event horizon , except in cases with extremely fast - rotating black hole .",
    "compared to model a , it shows a flat profile in the innermost region , which extends the emission region with the same spin .",
    "moreover , the angular velocity of the accretion flow is much lower than the keplerian velocity , @xmath118 .",
    "the much weaker doppler effect makes the emission region more extended .    in order to make a good estimation of the black hole spin parameter , we should take advantage of the properties of the space - time geometry that are independent of configuration of the emission region .",
    "for example , the shape , size of the black hole shadow , and its horizontal shift from the rotation axis of the black hole @xcite are the same for different models with the same spin parameter , as if the emission region is assumed to extend to the event horizon . therefore , high - fidelity imaging via vlbi at mm / sub - mm wavelengths is critical for this . detecting the innermost stable circular orbit of hot - spot structure ,",
    "if exits , during flaring activity is another way to constrain the spin parameter directly @xcite .",
    "we consider eight potential stations to simulate the future 1.3 mm vlbi observations for sgr a * to test the specific accretion flow model with plasma wave heating mechanism .",
    "these stations provide a highest angular resolution of @xmath119as , which is comparable to the apparent angular size of the predicted black hole shadow structure . for our fiducial model with @xmath120 and @xmath121 ,",
    "the recent 1.3 mm vlbi measurements constrain its black hole spin parameter as @xmath122 .",
    "more detailed visibility analysis suggests that future vlbi observations can improve these estimates substantially .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the black hole parameter estimation is dependent on the specific model adopted to fit the observations .",
    "this is born out by other efforts to fit the 1.3mm - vlbi results .",
    "@xcite followed the general riaf model but adopted a keplerian velocity distribution .",
    "they preferred small values of black hole spin .",
    "this is different from the prediction of extremely large spin from our model b , which may be caused by different treatments of velocity field and gravitational effect , i.e. @xcite used pseudo - newtonian potential instead of kerr metric .",
    "interestingly , their likeliest values of black hole parameter , @xmath123 , are consistent with those preferred in our model a. the keplerian , or near keplerian , velocity field generically makes the emission region more compact , preferring small spin parameter .",
    "their most probable combination is with values @xmath124 .",
    "this orientation is consistent with the preference of a high inclination angle and a small position angle for the same riaf model , constrained by size measurements in 7 mm and 3 mm @xcite .",
    "however , our model a with the same combination is excluded by observational data because it predicts too compact an image for the emission region .",
    "this is due to our use of the plasma wave heating mechanism .",
    "there are other efforts of estimations on the black hole parameters , especially orientation , based on different observations and theoretical models .",
    "e.g. , @xcite derived a high inclination angle and a favorite value of @xmath125 for position angle , by comparing the visibilities observed in 7 mm and predicted by a jet - dominated model ; @xcite derived a high inclination angle and a range of @xmath126 for position angle , by assuming that an orbiting blob contributes to near - infrared flares and a jet component contributes to mm - to - submm emission .",
    "these models describe morphologies at 1.3 mm wavelength totally different from an accretion flow , which can only be distinguished by the future direct imaging .      in order to obtain a good @xmath7 coverage",
    ", we need simultanesous observation on baselines with various lengths and directions . according to theoretical predictions ,",
    "baseline lengths of @xmath127 are very important because the valley point structure of the visibility profile may be detected .",
    "fortunately , there are five potential stations , hawaii ( including jcmt ) , carma , smt , lmt , and the chilean ( including alma ) , can provide such suitable baseline lengths .",
    "although the coverage is still poor , they can perform simultaneous observations at similar lengths but at almost perpendicular directions .",
    "the basic geometry of the emission region of sgr a * may be estimated by them .",
    "furthermore , alma provides excellent sensitivity on baselines as long as @xmath128 ( on baseline ah ) .",
    "it is expected to make a critical contribution to future sub - mm vlbi observations of sgr a*.    the proposed station in new zealand , mt - cook , also makes great contribution .",
    "it provides long baselines at a large range of direction . with its participation ,",
    "these eight stations cover almost all the directions at lengths of @xmath129 .",
    "the longest baseline length of @xmath130 , which can provide the highest resolution , is also achieved by mt - cook ( on baselines cm and ms ) .    with the earth s rotation ,",
    "these eight stations produce sufficient @xmath7 coverage to produce images of sgr a*. however , it takes almost 11 hours to complete . in this paper",
    ", we treat observations within 2 hours as the simultaneous and those within 4 hours as the quasi - simultaneous .",
    "the estimate of the basic geometry of the emission region is made from the hypothetic observation of four hours duration , e.g. , with _ sub - coverage i _ mentioned in sec.[cov ] adopted .",
    "thus , we have to assume that sgr a * is in its stable state during the entire 4-hour period .",
    "if we want to make more detailed estimates using coverage in a larger range of directions , we must assume that this stable state exists even longer .",
    "however , a number of flares have been observed in sgr a * at 1.3 mm , on timescales as short as 30 minutes .",
    "therefore , reliable estimates can only be made when either sgr a * is quiescent , the flaring region is subdominant at 1.3 mm , or the observation lasts for @xmath131 hour ( resulting in poorer coverage and less opportunity to detect the visibility valley associated with the black hole shadow ) .",
    "there is one more short - coming in the @xmath7 coverage .",
    "region with baseline lengths of @xmath129 is covered in almost all the directions .",
    "however , the most important region with baseline lengths of @xmath132 is lack of coverage in northeast - southwest direction . during any simultaneous observation within 2 hours , coverage in two perpendicular directions can be obtained . however , at least one more direction between those two is necessary for a good estimation of the emission region geometry , also for a higher possibility of detection on the valley point structure .",
    "this can only be improved with an additional new station included , e.g. , one in new zealand .",
