    "the present work is a direct continuation of paper  @xcite .",
    "we recall that a new construction was proposed in it of an invariant of 3-dimensional closed oriented piecewise - linear manifolds .",
    "the invariant was built on the base of a classical ( not quantum ) solution of pentagon equation , i.e.  algebraic relation corresponding to a `` 2 tetrahedra @xmath2 3 tetrahedra '' local re - building of a manifold triangulation ( formula ( 5 ) in  @xcite .",
    "below , we are using notations like  ( * ? ? ? * ( 5 ) ) for references of such kind ) .",
    "only the simplest realization of these ideas was done in paper  @xcite .",
    "an invariant  @xmath3 was constructed that was expressed in terms of euclidean metric values assigned to every tetrahedron .",
    "then @xmath3 was calculated for the sphere  @xmath4 , the projective space  @xmath5 , and also for some lens spaces @xmath6 ( it was not described in paper  @xcite how the calculations were done for @xmath6",
    ". it will suffice for us now if we say that they were a direct generalization of calculations for  @xmath5 ) .",
    "for all tested examples of lens spaces we got @xmath7{1}}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this showed that our invariant  @xmath3 in such form as presented in  @xcite was not very interesting for topology because it could not distinguish the lens spaces with different  @xmath8 . at the same time , in the concluding section  7 of paper  @xcite an idea was proposed how to modify  @xmath3 in the way that could hopefully lead to a more refined invariant .",
    "the idea consists , briefly , in using some mappings of the manifold s _ universal covering _ in the euclidean space  @xmath9 in order to put metric values in correspondence to tetrahedra .    in the present work we make this idea concrete and",
    "show that in such way one can indeed construct more refined invariants .",
    "our key example will be lens spaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as is well - known",
    ", they are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic , and can serve as a natural test of nontriviality for topological invariants .",
    "we would like to say at once that our new invariants pass this test and thus can , most likely , compete successfully with the quantum invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds . a remark on possible advantages of classical invariants",
    "is made in the concluding section  [ sec discussion ] .",
    "we consider triangulations or `` pre - triangulations '' of 3-dimensional closed oriented manifolds . by pre - triangulation we understand a manifold represented as a `` pre - simplicial complex '' in the sense of textbook  @xcite : the manifold is decomposed in simplices of dimensions 3 , 2 , 1 and  0 in such way that the boundary of a given simplex may consist of _ coinciding _ simplices of lower dimensions ( in particular , in section  [ sec linzy ] we decompose lens spaces in tetrahedra in such way that only two vertices of each tetrahedron are different and , moreover , there are sometimes coinciding ones between the six edges of a tetrahedron .",
    "moreover , the simplices of dimensions  @xmath10 may not be determined by the set of their vertices ) .",
    "we are going to put metric values ( edge lengths , dihedral angles , volumes ) in correspondence to all tetrahedra in the pre - triangulation , as it was done in paper  @xcite . to be exact",
    ", we will do the following .",
    "choose a consistent orientation of all tetrahedra in the pre - triangulation ( using the manifold s orientability ) .",
    "assign to all edges ( one - dimensional cells of the complex ) positive real numbers   lengths   in such way that every individual tetrahedron could be placed in a 3-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "this means that one can calculate in a usual way dihedral angles at each edge in every tetrahedron , and one can assume that those angles take values from @xmath11 to  @xmath12 .",
    "next , we assign to each tetrahedron a `` @xmath13 '' or `` @xmath14 '' sign and impose the following condition : the algebraic sum of dihedral angles around each edge must equal @xmath11 modulo  @xmath15 , where `` algebraic sum '' means that each dihedral angle , which is calculated , as we have mentioned , from the six edge lengths of some tetrahedron , is taken with the sign `` @xmath13 '' or `` @xmath14 '' that is assigned to that tetrahedron .",
    "this is exactly the condition that is implied in formulas of paper  @xcite , starting from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 5 ) ) .",
    "such assignment ( of lengths to edges and signs to tetrahedra ) was realized in paper  @xcite in the following way .",
    "all _ vertices _ of the complex were mapped into the 3-dimensional euclidean space  @xmath9 . for every tetrahedron in the complex we took the images of its four vertices in  @xmath9 and demanded that the tetrahedron spanned by them should be nondegenerate ( of course , this is possible only if all the four vertices are different ) .",
    "assume also that we have fixed the orientation of  @xmath9 .",
    "then a tetrahedron in the pre - triangulation either conserves its orientation under the mapping to  @xmath9 or changes it ( recall that we have fixed a consistent orientation for the tetrahedra ) . in the first case , we assign the `` @xmath13 '' sign to it , in the second   the `` @xmath14 '' sign . as for the edge lengths , they are , of course , the distances between the relevant vertices in  @xmath9 .",
    "in the present paper , we generalize this construction according to the remark in section  7 of paper  @xcite ( and it is exactly this generalization that leads us to our new results ) .",
    "we take the _ universal covering _ of the pre - triangulation of manifold  @xmath16 considered as a cell complex .",
    "its vertices are divided in classes   the inverse images of each given vertex with respect to the covering map .",
    "choose a representative in each class and map it into some point in the space  @xmath9 .",
    "next , fix a homomorphism @xmath17 of the fundamental group of manifold  @xmath16 in the group of motions of 3-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "suppose that some vertices @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the universal covering belong to the same class , then @xmath20 , where @xmath21 .",
    "denote the images of vertices in @xmath9 by the same letters with the tilde .",
    "we demand that for all such vertices @xmath22 .",
    "this construction yields ( in the general position ) a one - to - one correspondence between the vertices in the universal covering of our complex and their images in  @xmath9 . as for simplices of dimension  @xmath10 ,",
    "each of them yields thus a simplex in  @xmath9   the convex hull of corresponding vertices ( we emphasize that we do not care about possible intersections of such simplices in  @xmath9 but we demand that all the vertices of each tetrahedron in the _ universal covering _ should be different ) . hence we obtain lengths for the edges of the universal covering and signs   for its 3-dimensional cells in the same way as it was done two paragraphs before .",
    "then , it is clear that if two edges are mapped in the same one by the covering map then their lengths obtained from our construction are equal ( because their images in  @xmath9 are taken one into another by elements @xmath23 ) .",
    "the same holds for the tetrahedron signs .",
    "thus , we have assigned correctly the lengths to the edges and the signs to the tetrahedra of the manifold  @xmath16 s pre - triangulation itself and not only to its universal covering .    in section  [ sec linzy ]",
    "we present a concrete example of this construction for the case of lens spaces .",
    "it can be shown that our construction with the universal covering yields all possible ways of assigning lengths to the edges and signs to the tetrahedra with the condition that the algebraic sum of dihedral angles around each edge must be @xmath11 modulo  @xmath15 .",
    "we will not , however , use this fact in the present paper .",
    "* important remark : * a homomorphism @xmath24 takes part in our construction .",
    "this will lead to the fact that our invariant corresponds in reality to a _ pair _ @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath26 there exist , as we will see , three non - equivalent @xmath27 , excluding the trivial homomorphism whose image is unity ( in  @xcite we were dealing , in essense , with exactly this `` trivial '' case ) .",
    "thus , we have assigned metric values to elements of pre - triangulation in a more general way than in paper  @xcite .",
    "most of the other constructions in  @xcite do not need any generalization : the main thing that we are going to do is calculate our key differential form  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 30 ) ) and extract a numeric invariant from it .",
    "the contents of the remaining sections is as follows . in section  [ sec obsch - proizv ]",
    "we write down general formulas for the partial derivatives of `` defect angles '' ( we recall _ en passant _ their definition ) with respect to the edge lengths .",
    "the matrix of such derivatives is needed for constructing our invariants . in section  [ sec linzy ]",
    "we are concerned with calculations as such for lens spaces @xmath0 and  @xmath1 . in the concluding section  [ sec discussion ]",
    "we put forward a conjecture concerning the value of our invariants for _ any _ lens spaces , remark on the possible advantages of classical invariants , and discuss some intriguing unsolved problems .",
    "in the introduction we mapped the universal covering of a pre - triangulated manifold  @xmath16 in euclidean space  @xmath9 .",
    "the pull - back of one cell ( simplex ) from  @xmath16 with respect to the covering map was a set of @xmath28 cells which were mapped , according to our construction , in isometric simplices in  @xmath9 .",
    "suppose that euclidean tetrahedra @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 correspond in such way to a tetrahedron @xmath32 lying in  @xmath16 .",
    "now we , first , will no longer write the tildes ( that stayed for points in @xmath9 , see introduction .",
    "we thus identify the vertices in the universal covering and their images in  @xmath9 ) .",
    "second , we define the oriented volume of tetrahedron @xmath32 as @xmath33 of the following triple scalar product : @xmath34    our next task is to make some formulas of paper  @xcite more accurate .",
    "namely , we are going to take carefully into account the orientation of angles and volumes and thus remove the absolute value signs .",
    "introduce ( small ) defect angles aroung edges like in paper  @xcite : slightly ( and otherwise arbitrarily ) change the edge lengths ; after that the algebraic sums of dihedral angles aroung edges cease to be zero . by definition , such sum around a given edge  @xmath35 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is called defect angle ( defined modulo  @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that the sign of expression ( [ eq or - obem ] ) is nothing but the sign corresponding to the tetrahedron , i.e.  the sign with which the dihedral angles of the tetrahedron enter in each algebraic sum  @xmath38 .",
    "we will need formulas for the partial derivatives @xmath39 of defect angles with respect to edge lengths taken when all @xmath40 .",
    "we are going to express these derivatives in terms of those lengths and oriented tetrahedron volumes .",
    "nonzero derivatives are obtained in the following cases .",
    "edges @xmath41 and @xmath42 are skew edges of tetrahedron @xmath43 , and there is no more tetrahedron in the pre - triangulation that would have as its edges both @xmath35 and  @xmath44 : @xmath45    this formula coincides , in essense , with formula  ( * ? ? ? * ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the only difference is that we now take into account the signs of angles and volumes .",
    "edges @xmath46 and @xmath42 belong to the common face of two neighboring tetrahedra and , again , there is no more tetrahedron that would have both @xmath35 and  @xmath44 as its edges ( fig .",
    "[ fig peresek rebra ] ) : @xmath47    to prove this formula , we draw edge  @xmath48 in fig .  [ fig peresek rebra ] .",
    "suppose that lengths @xmath49 and @xmath50 in fig .",
    "[ fig peresek rebra ] are free to change , while the lengths of remaining eight edges are fixed .",
    "we get : @xmath51 ( this is , in essense , formula  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1 ) ) but now with the proper notice to volume signs ) .    denote @xmath52 the dihedral angle at edge @xmath53 in tetrahedron @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55    multiplying ( [ eq * _ 1 ] ) by ( [ eq * _ 2 ] ) and using the fact that @xmath56 , we get formula  ( [ eq * _ 0 ] ) .",
    "edge @xmath57 is common for exactly three tetrahedra @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and no one of those tetrahedra contains this edge more than one time : @xmath61    this is simply formula  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 5 ) ) but with all signs taken into account .",
    "edge @xmath57 is common for @xmath62 tetrahedra , and again no one of those tetrahedra contains this edge more than one time .",
    "we write out this formula only for the case of four tetrahedra ( in the case of their greater number , the generalization is obvious ) depicted in fig .",
    "[ r2 ] : @xmath63 here in the right - hand side we wrote the right - hand side of  ( [ eq poka 6 ] ) plus the similar term obtained from it by replacing @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "formula  ( [ eq 4j ] ) comes out if we draw the diagonal @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ r2 ] and apply formula  ( [ eq poka 6 ] ) to each of figures @xmath66 and  @xmath67 . adding up the defect angles around @xmath48 in each of those figures we get nothing else than @xmath68 for the whole figure @xmath69 , because the `` redundant '' dihedral angle , namely the angle at  @xmath48 in tetrahedron @xmath70 , enters two times with different signs .      in reality , our definition of pre - triangulation admits such glueings between faces and , consequently , edges of tetrahedra where different _ combinations _ of above mentioned cases appear . to be exact",
    ", the edge  @xmath44 may    * lie opposite to edge @xmath35 ( 1st case ) in one or more than one tetrahedron ; * belong to the same two - dimensional face as @xmath35 ( 2nd case ) , and again there may be more than one such faces ; * coincide with @xmath35 ( as in the 3rd or 4th case ) ,    and these possibilities ( as we will see in section  [ sec linzy ] ) do not exclude one another .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that if a tetrahedron contains a given edge  @xmath35 several times then @xmath38 includes , of course , the _ sum of all _ corresponding dihedral angles of that tetrahedron multiplied by the sign of its oriented volume  ( [ eq or - obem ] ) .    thus , there may be several `` ways of influence '' of differential @xmath71 on differential  @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , the terms corresponding to those ways sum together . formulas ( [ eq pok1 ] ) and  ( [ eq pok2 ] ) below are good examples of how the expression for @xmath73 ( in them , it is divided by  @xmath74 ) can look like .",
    "the partial derivatives that we were dealing with in this section will be used to calculate the differential form ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 30 ) ) from which we will extract manifold invariants .",
    "the formulas and arguments of paper  @xcite leading to that formula remain valid if we only modify the notion of `` permitted length configuration '' , extending the word `` permitted '' to any set of edge lengths obtained according to the construction with universal covering presented in the introduction to this work .    the remarks in the end of section  4 of  @xcite ( after theorem  4 ) on the behavior of form ( * ?",
    "? * ( 30 ) ) under the adding of a new vertex to the ( pre-)triangulation remain valid as well . in formulas (",
    "* ( 31 ) and ( 32 ) ) , one can take as point  @xmath75 any one of `` copies '' @xmath76   images in @xmath9 of its pull - back with respect to the covering map .",
    "on the other hand , we will see in the next section that we must change the `` standard '' differential form ( * ? ? ? * ( 33 ) ) in order to calculate our new invariants for @xmath0 and  @xmath1 .",
    "we recall some facts about lens spaces .",
    "let @xmath77 , @xmath78 , be a pair of relatively prime integers .",
    "consider a @xmath79-gonal bipyramid , i.e.  the union of two cones over a regular @xmath79-gon .",
    "denote as @xmath80 the vertices of the @xmath79-gon , and by @xmath81 and @xmath82   the cone vertices .",
    "for every @xmath83 , we glue face @xmath84 to face @xmath85 ( the subscripts are taken modulo @xmath79 ; the vertices are glued in the order in which they are written ) .",
    "what we thus obtain is exactly the lens space @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ ris3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath6 is a 3-dimensional closed oriented manifold .",
    "its fundamental group @xmath86 is isomorphic to @xmath87 . as a generator of @xmath86 one",

    "we will obtain one possible proof of their non - homeomorphness when we find out that our invariants for those spaces do not coincide .",
    "a homomorphism of the fundamental group of a lens space in the group  @xmath92 of motions of euclidean space can be characterized by an integer  @xmath93 if we demand that @xmath94 be mapped in the rotation through angle @xmath95 around some axis . that axis can be taken by definition as the coordinate axis  @xmath96 .",
    "there exist three essentially different nonzero @xmath93 for @xmath97 ( @xmath98 leads to the case of paper  @xcite ) : @xmath99 and  @xmath100 .",
    "the image of the universal covering of space @xmath6 ( if @xmath101 ) in @xmath9 looks as follows .",
    "vertices @xmath102 ( `` copies '' of one and the same vertex  @xmath103 ) are situated in vertices of a regular @xmath79-gon for which axis  @xmath96 is the symmetry axis . the same applies to vertices @xmath104 ( `` copies '' of vertex  @xmath105 .",
    "thus , our bipyramid has only two different [ not identified with each other ] vertices : @xmath103 and  @xmath105 ) .",
    "we can assume that the cylindrical coordinates of points @xmath102 and @xmath104 are : @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , while @xmath109 and @xmath110 are any real numbers .",

    "then the bipyramid finds itself decomposed in @xmath79 tetrahedra grouped around edge  @xmath111 .",
    "assume the following notations for edges ( notation `` @xmath35 '' and `` @xmath112 '' have been already introduced but we repeat them ) : @xmath113 on the whole , there are @xmath114 edges , and this will be the size of square matrix @xmath115 entering in formula  ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is obvious from geometric considerations that this image is determined by four parameters , say , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath110 and @xmath109 in formulas ( [ eq * _ 10 ] ) , or otherwise by the lengths of four edges which we have included in  @xmath121 .",
    "the fact important for us is that these four lengths ( in the general position ) can take arbitrary infinitesimal increments from which the other length differentials are determined unambiguously , and one can assume that they are determined from conditions @xmath122 , where the letter  @xmath83 runs over all edges . according to paper  @xcite ,",
    "this means that our decomposition of the set of edges in @xmath123 and @xmath121 is suitable for use in formula  ( * ? ? ?",

    "thus , if expressed through @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath110 and @xmath109 , it inevitably takes the form @xmath157 the form of function @xmath158 is easily obtained from reasoning of the same type as in section  5 of paper  @xcite : differential form  ( [ eq new30 ] ) must be represented as the exterior product of the volume form for point  @xmath105 , i.e.@xmath159 by a factor not depending on the location of point  @xmath105 with respect to point  @xmath103 and symmetry axis  @xmath96 .",
    "this must also hold for point  @xmath103 .",
    "thus , we are led unambiguously to formula  ( [ eq * _ 20 ] ) for the form  ( [ eq new30 ] ) .",
    "the proposition is proved .    in the case we are considering ,",
    "it is natural to take the constant entering in  ( [ eq * _ 20 ] ) as our invariant ( which , we recall , we put in correspondence to the _ pair _ @xmath25 , where @xmath27 is a homomorphism from @xmath160 to  @xmath92 ) .    in the numerator of formula  ( [ eq new30 ] ) we see the exterior product @xmath161 which in our case , as one can check , has the form ( we write it out for arbitrary @xmath79 and  @xmath8 ) @xmath162 ( @xmath163 was introduced in formula ( [ eq * _ r ] ) ) .",
    "this shows that the * dependence of the denominator of formula  ( [ eq new30 ] ) on  @xmath109 must , too , reduce to a factor  @xmath164 * , in order that this factor could cancel out and we get a formula of type  ( [ eq * _ 20 ] ) .",
    "we hope that , with this remark , our calculations of the expression  ( [ eq new30 ] ) , for which we actively used the maple program ( the most difficult step was the calculation of determinants of matrices ( [ eq minor l(7,1 ) ] ) and  ( [ eq minor l(7,2 ) ] ) ) , will be repeatable .    here",
    "are the results for our invariant , i.e.  value `` @xmath165 '' from formula  ( [ eq * _ 20 ] ) , which we will now call @xmath166 because it depends on the integer @xmath93 from formulas  ( [ eq * _ 10 ] ) that determines the homomorphism  @xmath27 .",
    "we recall that it is enough to consider @xmath99 or  @xmath100 for @xmath167 .",
    "so , with the precision of ten significant digits , @xmath168    it is obvious that @xmath0 can not be homeomorphic to  @xmath1 .",
    "exact expressions for values of @xmath166 in terms of trigonometric functions are presented in discussion , formula  ( [ eq i_k obsch ] ) , together with a conjecture about their form for an arbitrary lens space .",
    "invariants of the stated type can be calculated for any 3-dimensional closed orientable manifolds .",
    "it looks very plausible that they can be also generalized to manifolds with boundary and not necessarily orientable .",
    "it looks clear that the differential form  ( [ eq * _ 20 ] ) whose very appearance is connected with the presence of one symmetry axis in the image in  @xmath9 of the universal covering of manifold pre - triangulation will have to be replaced with other forms , as soon as the fundamental group of the manifold is different from  @xmath169 ( recall also the differential form ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 33 ) ) that corresponded to the trivial homomorphism  @xmath27 ) .    as for the lens spaces with arbitrary @xmath79 and @xmath8",
    ", we have the following conjecture about the values of invariant @xmath166 for them : @xmath170 .",
    "\\label{eq i_k obsch}\\ ] ] approximate values of exactly these numbers were presented in formulas ( [ eq i_1 l(7,1)])([eq i_3 l(7,2 ) ] ) .",
    "note that formula  ( [ eq i_k obsch ] ) agrees with the known fact  @xcite that lens spaces @xmath171 and @xmath172 are homeomorphic if ( and only if ) @xmath173 indeed , if @xmath174 , then , obviously , @xmath175 . if , on the other hand , @xmath176 , then @xmath177 , i.e.  the set of numbers corresponding to the space is the same .",
    "our invariants may be interesting also because they depend not only on a manifold  @xmath16 but also on a homomorphism @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , they make it possible to distinguish the generators of fundamental groups for lens spaces .      * in preprint",
    "@xcite a `` higher analogue of pentagon equation '' is presented   an algebraic relation corresponding to a @xmath178 re - building of a cluster of 4-simplices ( expressed , again , in terms of euclidean metric values assigned to those simplices ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to construct a 4-manifold invariant on this basis .",
    "if our classical invariants work for higher - dimensional manifolds , which looks plausible , this would be an advantage with respect to the known quantum invariants because , for these latter , it is quite unclear how to generalize them nontrivially to higher dimensions .",
    "maybe , equations of pentagon type that arise in connection with multidimensional topology will give an idea of how to construct integrable models in multidimensional _ mathematical physics _ as well . * in paper  @xcite , we have constructed one more classical solution of pentagon equation which we called @xmath179-solution .",
    "we must recognize that we were not yet able to `` globalize '' it , that is build on its basis invariants of 3-manifolds , not to say of passing to higher dimensions . *",
    "the third intriguing question is whether we can invent some quantum objects of which our classical solutions ( presented in @xcite and  @xcite ) are quasiclassical limits ."
