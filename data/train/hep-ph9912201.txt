    "recently , cleo collaboration have improved their previous measurements of @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath4 these branching ratios are much larger than the estimations under the standard theorectical frame which is based on the effective hamiltonian and general factorization approximation .",
    "now it is commonly believed that these large branching ratios are due to the special properties of @xmath5 , and several new mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the decay rates of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the following",
    "we only discuss the standard model(sm ) mechanisms because we think that the contribution of the sm should be carefully examined first .",
    "halperin and zhitnisky @xcite proposed an interesting mechanism : @xmath5 can be directly produced through @xmath8 if @xmath9 .",
    "but if this mechanism dominates , one easily find that @xmath10 which is in contradiction with the stringent upper limit of @xmath11 given by cleo @xcite : @xmath12 so this mechanism is unlikely to be dominant . because the effective vertex of @xmath13 in sm is very small , @xmath14 @xcite is also impossible to account for the large @xmath6 branching ratios .",
    "the authors of ref @xcite proposed that @xmath15 and @xmath16 via qcd anomaly can account for the large semi - inclusive branching ratios of @xmath7 .",
    "cleo @xcite have measured the @xmath5 momentum spectrum in @xmath7 and this measurement favors the mechanism of ref@xcite .",
    "but because it has an extra gluon in the final state , unless the gluon is soft and absorbed into the @xmath5 wave functions @xcite , it seems difficult to realize its contribution to two - body exclusive decay @xmath6 .",
    "motivated by the idea of ref @xcite , the authors of ref @xcite proposed di - gluon fusion mechanism , which is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "because both of the gluons are hard , it seems reasonable to give a perturbative qcd estimation .",
    "but because of our ignorance about the form factor of @xmath1 vertex , there are large uncertainties in calculations .",
    "so in the following we would reanalyze di - gluon fusion mechanism in detail using several kinds of @xmath17 form factors and compare our numerical results with experimental data .",
    "we first give a brief introduction on how to estimate contributions of di - gluon fusion mechanism in perturbative qcd .",
    "@xmath18 vertex can be parameterized as @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a constant and can be extracted from @xmath21 or @xmath22 , @xmath23 is qcd coupling constant , @xmath24 is @xmath17 form factor and @xmath25 . neglecting the transverse momentum of quarks and taking the wave functions for @xmath26 and @xmath27 meson as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an identity in color space , and the integration of the distribution amplitude",
    "is related to the meson decay constant , @xmath30 in this paper , we take the distribution amplitudes as@xcite : @xmath31 then we can write the amplitude of fig.1 as @xmath32 4 \\epsilon^{\\mu \\nu \\alpha \\beta } k_{1\\alpha } k_{2\\beta } a_{\\eta^{\\prime } } f(k_1 ^ 2,k_2 ^ 2 ) c_f g_s^3 } { \\sqrt{2 } \\sqrt{2 } k_1 ^ 2 k_2 ^ 2 } \\phi_k(y),\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the effective @xmath34 vertex@xcite @xmath35 and the color factor @xmath36\\delta^{ab}=\\frac{4}{3}$ ] .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath37 + f_2^i m_b m_b[(q\\cdot k_2 ) k_1 ^ 2-(q\\cdot k_1)(k_1\\cdot k_2 ) ] } { k_1 ^ 2 k_2 ^ 2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above integral , there are two singularities from the gluon propagators and sometimes there would be another singularity from the @xmath38 form factor ( for example , @xmath39 ) .",
    "we add a small pure imaginary number @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) to the denominator to get a convergent integral .    to evaluate the numerical result of eq.(10 ) , we take the form factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 according to ref@xcite as @xmath44 where @xmath45 are wilson coefficients at the nll level.(because qcd corrections maybe large , we do not take @xcite @xmath46 and @xmath47 which are derived from the sm without qcd corrections . )",
    "it is always subtle to choose the scale of @xmath48 , because the average momenta squared of the gluons are @xmath49 we prefer to choose @xmath50 though we also give the branching ratios when @xmath51 or @xmath52 in tab.1 and tab.2 .    as to the @xmath17 form factor @xmath24 ,",
    "because of our complete ignorance there are large uncertainties in the numerical evaluation of eq.(10 ) . in the following we try several kinds of form factors .    in ref@xcite",
    ", the authors have assumed that @xmath53-dependence of the form factor is weak and as an approximation they take form factor as a constant to explain large semi - inclusive decay @xmath54 . the difference between ref@xcite and ref@xcite is that the running of @xmath55 with the scale is considered in @xcite but not in @xcite .",
    "we also use their ansatz to estimate exclusive decays @xmath0 and @xmath2 . using eq.(10 ) , we give numerical results in tab.1 . from the table",
    "it seems that the constant form factor can account for the large branching ratios of @xmath0 , but unfortunately we would get much larger branching ratios of @xmath2 , which is strongly in contradiction with the cleo s measurements@xcite ( see , for instance , the case of @xmath56 in tab.1 ) .    from eq.(10 )",
    ", we notice that the amplitude must be integrated over a wide range of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , therefore the effects of @xmath57 , @xmath58 dependence of @xmath24 must be taken into account .",
    "the authors of ref@xcite choose the form factor as @xmath39 because such a form factor works well in @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "we have followed their calculations and it seems that their numerical results are overestimated than ours(in tab.2 ) by a factor about three . from tab.2 , we can see that our estimations of @xmath60 are about @xmath3 , but when considering that the standard theoretical frame ( based on effective hamiltonian and general factorization approximation ) can give@xcite @xmath61 , it is still possible to account for the experimental data only if the contributions from di - gluon fusion mechanism and the standard theoretical frame constructively interfere . if this is true , then because the contributions to @xmath62 from the standard theoretical frame are negligible , the di - gluon fusion mechanism would be dominant in @xmath63 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath64 which can be tested by future measurements of cleo or b factories .",
    "kagan and petrov @xcite proposed a model of the @xmath18 vertex in which a pseudoscalar current is coupled to two gluons through quark loops .",
    "their perturbative calculations yield a form factor : @xmath65 where we take @xmath66 , @xmath67 and normalize @xmath24 with the normal condition @xmath25 .",
    "we use this form factor in eq.(10 ) with @xmath56 and get @xmath68 which is too small to account for the experiments .    in ref @xcite",
    ", the authors calculate the transition form factor in @xmath69 coupling to @xmath70 in the frame of a perturbative qcd based on the modified factorization formula .",
    "they find that numerically their results are extremely similar to that obtained by applying the interpolation procedure in the manner of brodsky and lepage in the case of two off - shell photons : @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that the structure of the transition of @xmath74 is similar to that of @xmath75 : @xmath76 where we approximate @xmath77 . by using this form factor",
    ", we calculate the branching ratios of @xmath0 which are listed in tab.3 .",
    "the results are about fifty times smaller than the experimental data .    in experimental fit",
    ", pole approximation is often used to fit the momentum square dependence of form factor @xcite . as a try",
    ", we also assume @xmath78 for our calculations , we list the results in tab.4 .",
    "and we can see that this kind of form factor would make the digluon fusion mechanism completely negligible in @xmath6 .",
    "to examine the validity of perturbative qcd in the above caculations , or in other words , whether the amplitude calculated by perturbative qcd is dominated by hard gluon contributions , we set cut on @xmath58 and compare the results with those without cut . taking @xmath79 , we list the numerical results in tab.v .",
    "we can see that hard gluon contributions are really dominant in the case of constant form factor .",
    "but if we take form factor as @xmath80 , hard gluon contributions are small , this does not mean that non - perturbative contributions are dominant in this case .",
    "this is due to the fact that the singularity in the form factor is accidently close to the other singularities in @xmath57 and @xmath58 and then enhance the contributions of soft gluon .",
    "the authors of ref @xcite proposed digluon fusion mechanism to explain the large branching ratios of @xmath6 , but because of our ignorance about effective @xmath1 vertex , there are large uncertainties in perturbative qcd estimations .",
    "we try several kinds of @xmath38 form factors , and through our calculations , we find that constant form factor is consistent with the data of @xmath6 , but inconsistent with the data of @xmath81 in some cases of different @xmath48 or @xmath82 .",
    "if we take @xmath80 as the authors of ref @xcite have done , di - gluon fusion mechanism is important in @xmath6 but not dominant . as a consequence",
    ", we could anticipate that @xmath83 would be about @xmath3 which can be tested by future experiments .",
    "we also try the other three kinds of form factors and they all give very small contributions to the branching ratios .    we conclude that , though we know little about @xmath17 form factor , if di - gluon fusion mechanism is important in @xmath6 , the branching ratios of @xmath81 would be definitely around @xmath3 .",
