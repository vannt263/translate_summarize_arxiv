    "in the last quarter of a century , @xmath3-manifold topology has been revolutionised by thurston and his school .",
    "this has generated a huge literature on hyperbolic @xmath3-manifolds building on the classical @xmath4-dimensional case .",
    "balanced against this is a relative paucity of techniques and examples of hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds for @xmath5 .",
    "recent work of ratcliffe and tschantz has provided examples of smallest possible volume when @xmath6 by identifying the faces of polytopes ( @xcite , see @xcite for a seminal example ) . on the other hand , in a construction more algebraic in nature , they computed the covolumes of the principal congruence subgroups of level @xmath7 a prime in @xmath8 , giving an infinite family of manifolds , with known volume , in every dimension @xcite . in a similar vein",
    ", @xcite allows one to construct manifolds in arbitrary dimensions by considering the kernels of representations of coxeter groups onto finite classical groups .",
    "however , it turns out that the volumes of the manifolds arising from both constructions are not particularly small ( eg : in @xcite the smallest @xmath2-dimensional example has euler characteristic @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus there seem to be no constructions in arbitrary dimensions that give examples , in low dimensions at least , of very small volume .",
    "this paper is an attempt to redress this .",
    "a construction is given that essentially makes algebraic the classical geometric idea of identifying the faces of a polytope .",
    "algebraic is meant in the following sense : any finite volume hyperbolic manifold arises as a quotient @xmath10 by the action of a group @xmath11 acting properly , freely , cofinitely by isometries on @xmath12 .",
    "the fundamental group of the manifold is thus isomorphic to @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , by mostow rigidity @xcite , finite volume hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds , for @xmath13 , are completely determined by their fundamental groups , in that two such manifolds are isometric precisely when their fundamental groups are isomorphic .",
    "thus , to construct @xmath14 , we construct @xmath11 .    the geometric notions of a free proper cofinite action can be replaced by the algebraic conditions that @xmath11 is a torsion free lattice in the lie group @xmath15 .",
    "the task can then be spilt into two parts .",
    "start with a coxeter group @xmath16 embedded as a lattice in @xmath17 .",
    "fortunately , there already exists an extensive literature on such hyperbolic coxeter groups ( see @xcite and the references there ) . by selbergs lemma @xcite ,",
    "such a @xmath16 is virtually torsion free ( as indeed is any abstract coxeter group ) , so the second step is to find the desired torsion free @xmath11 as a subgroup of finite index .",
    "the machinery necessary for this second step preoccupies most of this paper  it is combinatorial in nature and uses only the algebraic properties of @xmath16 .",
    "basic properties of the resulting manifolds , such as volume and orientability , can then be determined from the structure of @xmath16 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows :  2 contains preliminary material about coxeter groups ;  3 gives the construction and the important role played by the conjugacy classes of finite coxeter groups ; these classes are determined in  4 , where the results of roger carter s lengthy investigation @xcite are summarized in a form amenable to our purposes ; computing volumes is achieved via the ( standard ) techniques of  5 , and  6 contains three examples , one in each of @xmath1 and @xmath2-dimensions .",
    "these three are either the smallest possible ( @xmath6 ) or would appear to be the smallest - dimensional manifold with @xmath18 the volume of our example @xcite .",

    "let @xmath16 be a group and @xmath20 finite .",
    "the pair @xmath21 is called a coxeter system ( and @xmath16 a coxeter group ) if @xmath16 admits a presentation with generators @xmath22 , and relations , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see @xcite for basic facts about coxeter groups ) .",
    "it is customary to omit relations for which @xmath26 .",

    "it is a standard abuse of notation to denote a coxeter group and its symbol by the same letter .",
    "coxeter groups satisfy a freiheitssatz , in the sense that for any @xmath33 , the subgroup of @xmath16 generated by the @xmath34 is also a coxeter group with symbol obtained from @xmath16 by removing those nodes not in @xmath35 and their incident edges . in general , a subsymbol of @xmath16 is some subset of the vertices and their incident edges .",
    "if a symbol @xmath16 is disconnected with connected components @xmath36 , then @xmath16 is isomorphic to @xmath37 .",
    "a group with connected symbol is called irreducible .",
    "it should come as no surprise that in finding torsion free subgroups of coxeter groups the finite , or spherical , coxeter groups play a central role .",
    "the finite irreducible coxeter groups are well known to be : the weyl groups of simple lie algebras over @xmath38 , the dihedral groups , the group of symmetries of a regular dodecahedron , and the group of symmetries of the regular 4-dimensional polytope , the 120-cell .",
    "the killing - cartan notation will be used throughout this paper , in which the weyl groups fall into three infinite classical families , @xmath39 as well as five exceptional groups , @xmath40 .",
    "the non - weyl groups are the dihedral @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and the dodecahedron and 120-cell symmetry groups @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( note that there are the exceptional isomorphisms @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "the symbols for the weyl groups are in tables [ roots1]-[roots2 ] , and the non - weyl groups in proposition [ nonweyl2 ] and table [ roots3 ] . given an arbitrary ( not necessarily connected ) coxeter symbol , it represents a finite coxeter group if and only if each of its connected components is in the list above .",
    "a smaller role is reserved for the parabolic coxeter ( or affine weyl ) groups : the irreducible ones are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . for their symbols ,",
