    "since the af @xmath20 interaction is dominant and the @xmath18 and @xmath19 ones are not negligible in cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 , we infer that the cu2 and cu3 spins form a similar spin - singlet - like pairs .",
    "the finite magnetic moments of spin - singlet - like pairs are located at the cu2 and cu3 sites .",
    "taking cu1 into account , cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 has slightly distorted tetrahedral bonds . consequently , these lead to geometrical magnetic frustration among the @xmath21 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 interactions with the cu1 spins irrespective of the signs of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we discuss the mechanism of the successive phase transitions of the lros of af moments at @xmath6 and of that of wf moments with respect to the arrangement of case 1 and case 2 at @xmath7 .",
    "similar phenomena were reported for csnicl@xmath0 and csnibr@xmath0 , which have a triangular lattice of af chains.@xcite the components of the magnetic moments parallel and perpendicular to the chains are successively ordered in long range at @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( @xmath138).@xcite therefore , a disordered state of the perpendicular components appears between @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "this is explainable by both frustration due to the triangular lattice and anisotropy such as ising and single - ion anisotropies.@xcite in cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 , there is frustration among the @xmath21 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 interactions for two neighboring cu1 spins through the cu2 and cu3 spins in a chain",
    ". the dm interaction could be the origin of the anisotropy .",
    "accordingly , we infer that both the frustration and anisotropy generate af - lro of af moments and disorder of wf moments between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the successive phase transitions are not induced without frustration . in bacu@xmath9ge@xmath9o@xmath71 ,",
    "the af phase transition took place together with the formation of wf - lro at @xmath70 k , because it has only the anisotropy of the dm interaction.@xcite    some analogous materials , in which successive phase transitions were induced by both the frustration and dm interaction , were reported . in ni@xmath8v@xmath9o@xmath10 , two incommensurate and two commensurate phases successively appear .",
    "the wf - lro in the commensurate phase and ferroelectricity in the incommensurate phase have been observed.@xcite cub@xmath9o@xmath11 undergoes successive phase transitions to commensurate and incommensurate phases with decreasing temperature . in the commensurate phase , the field dependence of the magnetization reveals that cub@xmath9o@xmath11 is a weak ferromagnet with magnetic moments of the two antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices lying in the tetragonal plane of the crystal.@xcite moreover , a soliton lattice appears at around the temperature of transition to the incommensurate phase .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and anisotropy lead to the formation of a magnetic soliton lattice.@xcite these phenomena can be understood by effects of both the frustration and anisotropy .",
    "we studied the magnetic susceptibility @xmath34 , the magnetization , and the specific heat of cu@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal .",
    "the high - temperature magnetism can be described as a sum of the isolated spin dimers and the af linear chains in a rough approximation .",
    "we observed an af phase transition at 7.9 k together with an increase of the susceptibility along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "moreover , a jump is observed together with hysteresis in the magnetization below about 3.0 k when a tiny magnetic field along the @xmath5 axis is reversed .",
    "this result indicates that the wf phase transition occurs at @xmath139 k at zero magnetic field , but the coercive force is very weak .",
    "an increase of magnetization was observed along the @xmath38 axis with applying magnetic field and @xmath51 asymptotically approached @xmath46 .",
    "this wf moments on the @xmath110 plane can be explained by the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction in the cu1 linear chains .",
    "a component of magnetic moment parallel to the chain forms af - lro below @xmath6 , while a perpendicular component is disordered above @xmath7 at zero magnetic field and forms wf - lro below @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , wf - lro is also realized with applying magnetic fields between @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
