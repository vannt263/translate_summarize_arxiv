    "spontaneous oscillations have also been observed in single myofibrils in vitro @xcite .",
    "finally , dynein motors could be responsible for the oscillatory motion of axonemal cilia and flagella @xcite .",
    "the directionality of individual motors stems from interactions between different parts of the motor and from interactions between the motor and the track filament @xcite .",
    "the direction of motion of a large collection of motors may also be influenced by their cooperative mode of action .",
    "specifically , in several recent experiments the ability of motors to cooperatively induce bidirectional motion has been demonstrated .",
    "these _ in vitro _ experiments were performed by using motility assays in which a filament glides over a dense bed of motors .",
    "in one such experiment , unidirectional motion of actin filaments due to the action of myosin ii motors was transformed into bidirectional motion by the application of an external stalling electric field @xcite . under such conditions",
    "the external forces acting on the actin filament nearly balance the forces generated by the motors .",
    "electric field was also used to bias the direction of motion in kinesin - mt systems @xcite . in another experiment , bidirectional motion of mts",
    "was observed when subjected to the action of an ensemble of nk11 motors @xcite .",
    "these motors are a mutant form of the kinesin related ncd , which individually exhibit random motion with no preferred directionality @xcite .",
    "more recently , the motion of mts on a bed of a mixed population of plus - end ( kinesin-5 klp61f ) and minus - end ( ncd ) driven motors was shown to exhibit dynamics whose directionality depends on the ratio of the two motor species , including bidirectional movement over a narrow range of relative concentrations around the `` balance point '' @xcite .",
    "similarly , bidirectional transport of microspheres coated with kinesin ( plus - end directed ) and dynein ( minus - end directed ) on mts was also reported @xcite .",
    "several aspects of cooperativity in molecular motor systems have been addressed using different theoretical models @xcite .",
    "one feature which has not been treated in these studies is the dependence of the motion on the number of acting motors .",
    "a notable exception is the work of badoual _",
    "@xcite , where a two - state ratchet model has been used to examine the bidirectional motion observed in the nk11-mt motility assay described in ref .",
    "the model of badoual _",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated the ability of a large group of motors working cooperatively to induce bidirectional motion , even when individually the motors do not show preferential directionality .",
    "( the model also predicts that directional motors can also induce bidirectional movement , if the filaments are close to stalling conditions in the presence of an external load . )",
    "according to this model , the characteristic time in which the filament undergoes direction reversal ( `` reversal time '' ) , @xmath0 , increases exponentially with the number of motors , @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the reversal time diverges in the `` thermodynamic limit '' @xmath2 , and the motion persists in the direction chosen at random at the initial time .    in this work",
    ", we present an _ in vitro _ motility assay in which myosin ii motors drive the motion of globally a - polar actin bundles .",
    "these a - polar bundles are generated from severed ( polar ) actin filaments whose fragments are randomly recombined . when subjected to the action of a bed of myosin ii motors , these a - polar bundles exhibit bidirectional motion with characteristic reversal times that are in the range of @xmath3 sec .",
    "the reversal times of the dynamics show no apparent correlation with the size of the gliding bundles , or equivalently , with the number of motors @xmath1 interacting with the track ( which , because of the homogeneous spreading of the motors on the bed , is expected to be proportional to the size of the moving bundle ) .",
    "this observation is clearly in disagreement with the strong exponential dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 , predicted by badoual _",
    "et al._@xcite .    here , we propose a modified version of this model that explains the experimentally observed independence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "we argue that the origin of this behavior can be attributed to the tension developed in the actin track due to the action of the attached myosin ii motors .",
    "an increase in the number of attached motors leads to an increase in the mechanical load which , in turn , leads to an increase in the detachment rate of the motors , as already suggested in models of muscle contraction @xcite . unlike most previous studies where the myosin conformational energy was calculated , in this work we consider the elastic energy stored in the actin track and",
    "demonstrate that the detachment rate increases exponentially with @xmath1 .",

    "[ fig1 ] . the protocol , based on that of kuhn _",
    "@xcite , is described in detail above . in brief , the surface of a microscope slide was saturated with nem - inactivated myosin ii motors ( drawn as long , two headed , brown objects at the bottom of fig .  [ fig1]a ) and passivated by bsa ( blue balls in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "subsequently , actin filaments / bundles ( thin yellow line , fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) were grown and held firmly on the underside of the nem - myosin ii bed .",
    "[ fig1]b shows a characteristic fluorescent microscope image of the system which , at this stage , consisted of a large number of long actin bundles .",
    "the bundles were formed due to the presence of free @xmath30 ions ( concentration 1.67 mm ) , which induced attractive electrostatic interactions between the actin filaments @xcite . unlike bundles formed by certain actin - binding proteins , filaments formed by condensation in the presence of multivalent cations are randomly arranged within the bundles without any specific polarity @xcite . at lower concentrations of @xmath30 ( 0.5?mm ) , both thinner bundles and single filaments",
    "were observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .",
    "after the initial step , myosin ii minifilaments ( multi - headed brown objects , fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) were added to the cell sample .",
    "the motors that landed on the bsa surface created a homogeneous bed of immobile , yet active , motors .",
    "other motors landed on the actin filaments / bundles present on the surface .",
    "these motors started to move along the actin tracks , thereby exerting forces on the actin filaments , which led to the severing of small actin fragments @xcite ( fig .  [ fig2]a ) .",
    "the ruptured actin fragments were then free to move rapidly on the bed of active myosin ii motors .",
    "when gliding bundle fragments came into close proximity to other bundles , they could fuse , creating new , a - polar , bundles ( fig .",
    "see also supplementary information - movie 1 , showing a small actin piece severed from a filament , moving rapidly and fusing with a distant existing bundle ) .",
    "these newly created bundles could further fuse with each other to form even larger objects ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]f and the sequence of snapshots in figs .",
    "[ fig2]b - e depicting one such event of fusion of bundles ) .",
    "the rate of fusion events decreased with time and , after several minutes , the system relaxed into its final configuration , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig2]f ) .",
    "notice that the severing and rearrangement of the originally formed actin filaments / bundles ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) led to the formation of much shorter bundles ( figs .",
    "[ fig2]b - e ) .",
    "moreover , the random nature of the multiple fusion processes involved in the generation of these shorter bundles ensured that the final actin tracks were highly a - polar .",
    "indeed , the motion of most of the bundles shown in supplementary information - movie 2 was bidirectional ( `` back and forth '' motion ) , and only those bundles undergoing rare fusion events exhibited unidirectional motion .",
    "it is important to emphasize that bidirectional motion was observed only above a certain concentration of added myosin ii motors ( 0.6 @xmath6 m ) and only in the presence of atp . at lower concentrations of motors ( 0.3 @xmath6 m ) , the motion of actin bundles was directional ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] and supplementary information - movie 3 .",
    "note that in movie 3 , the motion takes place both along pre - existing actin tracks , as well as on the bsa bed , both which are covered by active myosin ii mini - filaments .",
    "the motion between these two areas is continuous , demonstrating that the whole surface is covered uniformly with motors . )",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the bidirectional movement originates from the action of the active myosin ii motors which ( i ) severed actin pieces , ( ii ) transported the severed fragments , which fused into actin tracks with randomly alternating polarities , and ( iii ) moved these a - polar actin tracks bidirectionally ( see supplementary information - movie 2 ) .",
    "fluorescence microscopy was used to follow the bidirectional motion of the actin tracks .",
    "[ fig4]a shows the position of center of mass of one bundle ( three snapshots are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4]b - d ) during a period of more than 10 minutes of the experiment .",
    "the dynamics of this bundle are representative of the motion of the other actin bundles .",
    "specifically , the one - dimensional motion of the bundle does not persist in the initial direction , but rather exhibits frequent direction changes .",
    "measurements of the position of the center of mass of the bundle were taken at time intervals of @xmath31 sec , and the mean velocity in each such period of motion was evaluated by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the displacement of the center of mass ( see section [ materialsandmethods ] ) .",
    "[ fig5]a shows the velocity histogram of the bundle shown in fig .",
    "the velocity histogram is bimodal indicating bidirectional motion .",
    "the speed of the bundle varies between @xmath34 @xmath6m / min , which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than the velocities measured in gliding assays of polar actin filaments on myosin ii motors @xcite .",
    "the fact that the typical speed of the bidirectional motion is considerably smaller than those of directionally - moving polar actin filaments can be partially attributed to the action of individual motors working against each other in opposite directions .",
    "the bidirectional movement consists of segments of directional motion which typically last between 2 to 10 time intervals of @xmath31 .",
    "the statistics of direction changes is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b which shows a histogram of the number of events of directional movement of duration @xmath28 .",
    "the characteristic reversal time , @xmath0 , can be extracted from the histogram by a fit to an exponential distribution : @xmath35 .",
    "this form ( which , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b , fits the data well ) is expected if the probability per unit time to `` turn '' in the opposite direction is independent of the time since the beginning of motion in a given direction .",
    "although figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] summarize the results corresponding to the movement of a single actin bundle , these results are representative of several tens of bundles whose motion we followed in several repeated experiments . in these experiments",
    "we observed that essentially _ all _ a - polar bundles exhibited bidirectional motion . for the sake of our quantitative analysis , we picked a smaller group of 19 bundles ( about 25% of all bundels ) for which both the reversal time and the number of acting motors @xmath1 ( which is proportional to the surface area , see section [ materialsandmethods ] ) could be determined with sufficiently high precision .",
    "the results corresponding to the motion of this sample of representative bundles are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . the choice of which bundles to include in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is based on the following practical reasons : the fluoresces intensity of small bundles is too low ( compared with the background ) and , thus , the accurate position and dimensions are hard to determine .",
    "very large bundles are practically immobile and their motion is smaller than the experimental spatial resolution ( see material and methods - section [ materialsandmethods ] ) . thus , the data in figure [ fig6 ] includes only bundles of `` intermediate '' size .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that while @xmath1 varies over half an order of magnitude , the corresponding @xmath0 are similar to each other ( @xmath36 sec ) and show no apparent correlation with @xmath1 .",
    "the bidirectional motion of motors was previously seen in systems consisting of motors that lack specific directionality @xcite , mixtures of motors working in opposite directions @xcite , or under the action of external forces close to stalling conditions ( forces acting on the filament that nearly balance the forces generated by the motors ) @xcite .",
    "one commonly used model for the dynamics of molecular motors in the biophysics literature is the brownian ratchet mechanism @xcite . within this modeling approach ,",
    "the motion of individual motor proteins is studied by considering the motion of a particle in a periodic , locally asymmetric , potential .",
    "it follows from the second law of thermodynamics that if the system is coupled to a thermal bath , the particle subjected to the periodic potential will not exhibit large scale directed motion .",
    "directed motion is possible only if the system is ( i ) locally asymmetric , and ( ii ) driven out of equilibrium by an additional deterministic or stochastic perturbation .",
    "this perturbation is used in the model to represent the consumption of atp chemical energy by the motors .",
    "ratchet models are not molecular in nature but rather present a way to identify the minimal physical requirements for the motion of motor proteins .",
    "however , by choosing properly the parameters of system , they may be employed to derive quantitative predictions for specific motor - filaments systems .",
    "ratchet models have been extended for describing and analyzing the collective motion of groups of motors .",
    "the motion of several motors is influenced by the motor - motor interactions @xcite and mechanical coupling @xcite .",
    "the model proposed by badoual _ at al . _",
    "@xcite ( and which , below , we present a slightly modified version of ) demonstrates that mechanical coupling between the motors is sufficient for the generation of highly cooperative bidirectional motion , even if the motors attach to / detach from the track in an uncorrelated fashion .    a key prediction of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite is the exponential increase of the mean reversal time of the bidirectional motion , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , the number of motors .",
    "this prediction is in contradiction with our experimental results ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . here , we show that this disagreement can be resolved by considering the stretching energy involved in the interactions between the actin track and the `` walking '' motors .",
    "accounting for this effect eliminates the exponential dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , when values representing myosin ii - actin systems were assigned to the parameters of the model , we found @xmath37 sec , which in a very good quantitative agreement with the experimental data .",

    ", this force randomly points to the right or to the left ( the total sum of these forces vanishes ) , which mimics the random , overall a - polar , nature of the actin bundles in our experiments .",

    "the two terms in the square brackets represent the forces due to the symmetric saw - tooth potential and the additional random local forces acting in each periodic unit .",
    "the latter are denoted by red arrows in fig .",
    "the function @xmath44 takes two possible values , 0 or 1 , depending on whether the motor @xmath43 is detached or attached to the track , respectively , at time @xmath28 .",
    "the group velocity of the motors ( relative to the track ) is determined by the equation of motion for overdamped dynamics : @xmath45 .",
    "the friction coefficient , @xmath46 , depends mainly on motors attached to the track at a certain moment and is therefore proportional to the number of connected motors , @xmath47 at time @xmath28 : @xmath48 .    to complete the dynamic equations of the model , we need to specify the transition rates between states ( 0 - detached ; 1 - attached ) .",
    "the motors change their states independently of each other .",
    "we define an interval of size @xmath49 centered around the potential minima ( the gray shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a ) .",
    "if located in one of these regions , an attached motor may become detached ( @xmath50 ) with a probability per unit time @xmath51 .",
    "conversely , a detached motor may attach to the track ( @xmath52 ) with transition rate @xmath53 only if located outside this region of size @xmath54 .",
    "however , we also allow another independent route for the detachments of motors , which may take place outside the gray shaded area in fig.[fig7]a ( i.e. , around the potential maxima ) and is characterized by an off rate @xmath55 .",
    "the rates @xmath51 , @xmath53 , @xmath55 ( see blue arrows in fig .",
    "7a ) , represent the probabilities per unit time of a motor to ( i ) detach after completing a unit step , ( ii ) attach to the track , or ( iii ) detach from the track without completing the step .    generally speaking ,",
    "the rates of transitions between states depend on many biochemical parameters , most notably the types of motors and tracks , and the concentration of chemical fuel ( e.g. , atp ) .",
    "they may also be affected by the forces induced between the motors and the filament , which result in increase in the configurational energy of the attached myosin motors @xcite and in the elastic energy stored in the s2 domains of the mini - filaments , as well as an increase in the stretching energy of the actin filament .",
    "the latter contribution can be introduced into the model via a modified detachment rate given by : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the change in the elastic energy of the actin track due to the detachment of one motor head .",
    "the dependence of @xmath57 on the number of connected motors @xmath58 ( out of a total number of motors , @xmath1 ) can be estimated in the following manner : consider a series of @xmath59 point particles connected by @xmath1 identical springs ( representing a series of sections of actin filaments ) having a spring constant @xmath60 ( see fig .",

    "[ eq2 ] it can be easily verified that @xmath68 .",
    "we thus conclude that the excess forces acting on the particles , @xmath69 , represent a series of random quantities with zero mean .",

    "[ fig7]c : one corresponding to @xmath100 ( solid circles ) , and the other to @xmath101 ( open circles ) , i.e. , without considering the effect of actin stretching , but when all the other system parameters mentioned above are kept unchanged .",
    "the latter case is qualitatively similar to the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , exhibiting a very strong exponential dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 ( indicated by the straight dashed - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig7]c ) .",
    "in contrast , the data corresponding to @xmath102 show much weaker variation in @xmath0 upon changing @xmath1 .",
    "the mean reversal times computed for @xmath103 are found in the range @xmath104 sec , which is in a very good quantitative agreement with the corresponding range of experimental results , and certainly does not grow to values of thousands of seconds as predicted for @xmath101 .",
    "the validity of our ratchet model is quite remarkable in view of its extreme simplicity ; but one must be aware of the following points of disagreement between the experimental and computational results ( which illustrate the limitations of the model ) : ( 1 ) the computed reversal times show weak , non - monotonic , dependence on @xmath1 which is not observed experimentally .",
    "( 2 ) the largest computed @xmath0 ( @xmath105 sec for @xmath106 ) is slightly larger than the experimentally measured reversal times .",
    "( 3 ) the computational results for @xmath107 and @xmath108 can not be directly compared with experimental results since the corresponding reversal times ( @xmath109 sec ) fall below the experimental resolution .",
    "the decrease of the computed reversal times for @xmath110 can be attributed to the `` mean field '' nature of calculation of @xmath55 , i.e. , to our assumption that ( for a given @xmath1 ) the detachment of each motor head leads to the same energy gain ( see eq .  [ eq4 ] ) . in reality , the energy change upon detachment of a motor depends , in some complex manner , on a number of factors such as the positions and chemical states of the motors .",
    "motors which release higher energy will detach at higher rates , and the detachment of these `` energetic '' motors will lead to the release of much of the elastic energy stored in the actin track .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that within the mean field approach , the number of disconnecting motors and the frequency of detachment events are probably over - estimated .",
    "this systematic error of the mean field calculation increases with @xmath1 , and the result of this is the decrease of @xmath0 in this regime , which is not observed experimentally . for even larger values of @xmath1 ( @xmath111 ) ,",
    "the model fails because @xmath112 and the effective attachment rate outside the gray shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a , @xmath113 , becomes negative , i.e. , motors detach from the track faster than they attach to it . in contrast , for @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and the effective attachment rate @xmath116 barely changes upon changing the model parameter from @xmath101 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) to @xmath102 ( our model ) .",
    "this seemingly minute change in @xmath116 ( which , nevertheless , involves a dramatic increase in @xmath55 ) leads to the following non - trivial outcome : on the one hand , the fraction of attached motors remains unchanged .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig7]d corresponds to _ both _ values of @xmath77 for which the results for @xmath117 are indistinguishable . on the other hand , the reversal times",
    "drop by as much as three orders of magnitude ( for @xmath118 ) when @xmath77 is modified from 0 to 0.0018 .",
    "this spectacular decrease in @xmath0 is , therefore , not the result in the change in the number of attached motors ( since , for each value of @xmath1 , the same fraction of motors is attached for both values of @xmath77 ) , but rather can be related to the less regular manner by which the motors detach from the track .",
    "the more frequent stochastic detachments of motors from the actin track increases the probability per unit time of motion reversal .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of myosin ii motors on actin tracks composed of small filamentous segments with randomly alternating polarities .",
    "the absence of global polarity leads to a bidirectional relative motion between the motors and the tracks .",
    "the characteristic reversal time of this motion is of the order of a few seconds and exhibits no particular dependence on the number of acting motors .",
    "bidirectional motion with macroscopic reversal times has been previously observed for nk11 motors on microtubules and has been attributed to the cooperativity of the motors . according to previously proposed models ,",
    "the signature of such a bidirectional cooperative motion is the strong exponential dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "the contradiction of this prediction with our experimental results can be reconciled by incorporating an additional feature into the model , namely , the effect of actin stretching by the walking motors . to reduce the associated elastic energy , the off rate of motors increases , and many of them detach from the track before completing a unit step .",
    "this effect reduces @xmath0 considerably and eliminates its exponential growth with @xmath1 .",
    "single molecule experiments have led to a dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and dynamics of individual molecular motors .",
    "however , many biological processes such as muscle contraction , cytokinesis , and the motion of axonemal cilia and flagella , involve cooperative action of many motors , which may be affected by the structure of the underlying track .",
    "this concept is clearly demonstrated in this work dealing with the bidirectional motion of myosin ii motors on actin tracks with randomly alternating local polarities , but without a net preferred directionality at the mesoscopic level",
    ". this unique type of motion is induced by the forces of individual motors whose collective effect is manifested in macroscopically large reversal times . at the same time , the cooperativity of these forces also increases the elastic energy of the track , and thereby limits the growth of @xmath0 .",
