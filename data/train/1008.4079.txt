    "<S> we consider the case of a single particle and @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest landau level is then related to theta functions @xcite : ( x , y)= ( 2 /_2)^1/4 e^-||^2()^2/_2 _ n=-^ e^2 in xe^i(y+n+)^2 . since , except for the normalization , @xmath122 depends only on the `` holomorphic coordinate '' @xmath3 and not on the `` anti - holomorphic '' coordinate @xmath123 it follows from theorem [ compa ] that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are compatible . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , the analyticity of @xmath122 is also seen from that of @xmath124 ; note that the boundary conditions are independent of @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> this work studies the response of driven open quantum system governed by adiabatically evolving lindbladians . when the lindblad operator is _ dephasing _ , coherence and phase information is degraded but the energy of the system is still conserved . in this case , we find that the response admits a geometric interpretation induced from the behavior of the instantaneous hilbert space projections .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the response associated with observables that can be derived by the principle of virtual work from the hamiltonian of the system . </S>",
    "<S> for these observables we find that , in contrast with the case of unitary evolution , there is residual dissipation : a spectral gap does not protect against dissipation in open systems in general .    </S>",
    "<S> our first main result , theorem [ theorem ] , concerns the special case of dephasing two - level systems and , more generally , certain dephasing systems characterized by a single rate @xmath60 . in this case , the response matrix admits a simple geometric interpretation : the non - dissipative transport is proportional to the adiabatic curvature @xmath34 and the dissipative response to the fubini - study metric @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> since the proportionality factor relating non - dissipative transport to the adiabatic curvature is a function of the dephasing rate @xmath60 , it follows that the robustness of chern numbers _ does not _ translate to a robustness of the transport coefficients against dephasing .    our second main result , theorem [ compatibility ] , </S>",
    "<S> is concerned with a geometric mechanism which provides protection against dephasing for certain non - dissipative response coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism leading to such a protection is the _ compatibility _ of the adiabatic curvature with the metric . in this case , the relation between transport coefficients and chern numbers is _ independent _ of the dephasing rate .    </S>",
    "<S> our third main result concerns test of compatibility . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that when the instantaneous stationary state are holomorphic functions of the driving parameters , the fubini - study metric is compatible with the adiabatic curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with three fundamental examples of compatible physical hamiltonians associated with the three types of control spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the first example of a compatible system is the qubit hamiltonian whose control space is the sphere , the second example of a compatible system is the harmonic oscillator whose control space is the plane and the third example is a model of the quantum hall effect on a torus .    * acknowledgments . * </S>",
