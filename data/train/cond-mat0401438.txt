    "nonequilibrium surface growth and interface dynamics represent an area of research that has received much attention in the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "a large number of discrete atomistic growth models  @xcite and stochastic growth equations  @xcite have been found  @xcite to exhibit _ generic scale invariance _ characterized by power law behavior of several quantities of interest , such as the interface width as a function of time ( measured in units of deposited layers ) and space- and time ",
    "dependent correlation functions of the interface height .",
    "much effort has been devoted to the classification of growth models and equations into different universality classes characterized by the values of the exponents that describe the dynamic scaling behavior implied by these power laws .",
    "a variety of experimental studies  @xcite have confirmed the occurrence of dynamic scaling in nonequilibrium epitaxial growth . among the various experimental methods of surface growth , molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe )",
    "is especially important because it plays a crucial role in the fabrication of smooth semiconductor films required in technological applications . under usual mbe growth conditions ,",
    "desorption from the film surface is negligible and the formation of bulk vacancies and overhangs is strongly suppressed .",
    "it is generally believed that nonequilibrium surface growth under these conditions is well  described by a _ conserved _ nonlinear langevin  type equation  @xcite and related atomistic models  @xcite that form the so  called `` mbe universality class '' .",
    "surface growth is an example of a general class of problems involving the dynamics of non  markovian , spatially extended , stochastic systems . in recent years ,",
    "the concept of _ persistence _  @xcite has proven to be very useful in analyzing the dynamical behavior of such systems @xcite . loosely speaking , a stochastic variable is _ persistent _ if it has a tendency to maintain its initial characteristics over a long period of time .",
    "the _ persistence probability _ @xmath4 is typically defined as the probability that a characteristic feature ( e.g. the sign ) of a stochastic variable does not change at all over a certain period of time @xmath5 .",
    "although the mathematical concept of persistence was introduced a long time ago in the context of the `` zero  crossing problem '' in gaussian stationary processes @xcite , it is only very recently that this concept has received attention in describing the statistics of first passage events in a variety of spatially extended nonequilibrium systems .",
    "examples of such applications of the concept of persistence range from the fundamental classical diffusion equation @xcite to the zero temperature glauber dynamics of the ferromagnetic ising and @xmath6state potts models @xcite and phase ordering kinetics @xcite .",
    "recently , a generalization of the persistence concept ( probability of persistent large deviations ) has been introduced @xcite . a closely related idea , that of sign  time distribution , was developed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "an increasing number of experimental results are also available for persistence in systems such as coalescence of droplets @xcite , coarsening of two  dimensional soap froth @xcite , twisted nematic liquid crystal @xcite , and nuclear spin distribution in laser polarized @xmath7 gas @xcite .",
    "recent work of krug and collaborators @xcite has extended the persistence concept to the first ",
    "passage statistics of fluctuating interfaces .",
    "persistence in the dynamics of fluctuating interfaces is of crucial importance in ultra  small scale solid  state devices .",
    "as the technology advances into the nanometric regime , questions such as how long a particular perturbation that appears in an evolving interface persists in time and what is the average time required for a structure to first fluctuate into an unstable configuration become important",
    ". the persistence probability can provide quantitative predictions on such questions .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have demonstrated the usefulness of the concept of persistence in the characterization of the equilibrium fluctuations of steps on a vicinal surface .",
    "analysis of experimental data on step fluctuations on al / si(111 ) @xcite and ag(111 ) @xcite surfaces has shown that the long  time behavior of the persistence probability and the probability of persistent large deviations in these systems agrees quantitatively with the corresponding theoretical predictions .",
    "these results show that the persistence probability and related quantities are particularly relevant for describing and understanding the long  time dynamics of interface fluctuations .    in the context of surface growth and fluctuations",
    ", the persistence probability @xmath8 may be defined as the probability that starting from an initial time @xmath9 , the interfacial height @xmath10 at spatial position @xmath11 does not return to its original value at any point in the time interval between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this probability is clearly the sum of the probabilities of the height @xmath10 always remaining above ( the _ positive _ persistence probability @xmath14 ) and always remaining below ( the _ negative _ persistence probability @xmath15 ) its specific initial value @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "this concept quantifies the tendency of a stochastic field ( in our case the interface height ) to persistently conserve a specific feature ( the sign of the interfacial height fluctuations ) .",
    "the persistence probability @xmath8 would , in general , depend on both @xmath12 and @xmath5 .",
    "in the early stage of the growth process starting from a flat interface ( transient regime ) , the interface gradually develops dynamical roughness @xcite due to the effect of fluctuations in the beam intensity . in this regime ,",
    "the choice of the initial time @xmath12 is clearly important : it determines the degree of roughness of the configuration from which the interface evolves . at long times",
    ", the growing interface enters into a new evolution stage , called the steady  state regime , characterized by fully developed roughness that does not increase further in time .",
    "in this regime , the choice of @xmath12 is expected to be unimportant .    the work of krug _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that for a class of _ linear _ langevin  type equations for surface growth and atomistic models belonging in the same dynamical universality class as these equations , the persistence probability decays as a power law in time for long times in both transient and steady  state regimes .",
    "these power laws define the positive and negative persistence exponents , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for positive and negative persistence in the transient and steady  state regimes , respectively .",
    "the @xmath20 symmetry of the linear growth equations implies that @xmath21 and @xmath22 in these systems . in ref .",
    ", it was pointed out that the persistence exponent in the steady state of these linear models is related to the dynamic scaling exponent @xmath23 , that describes the growth of the interface width @xmath24 as a function of time @xmath5 in the transient regime ( @xmath25 ) , through the relation @xmath26 .",
    "the validity of this relation was confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "since the exponent @xmath23 is the same for all models in the same dynamical universality class , this result implies that the persistence exponent in the steady  state regime of these _ linear _ models is also universal .",
    "numerical results for the persistence exponent in the transient regime , for which no analytic predictions are available , also indicate a similar universality .",
    "kallabis and krug @xcite carried out a similar calculation for ( 1 + 1)dimensional kardar ",
    "zhang ( kpz )  @xcite interfaces .",
    "they found that the nonlinearity in the kpz equation that breaks the @xmath20 symmetry is reflected in _",
    "different _ values of the positive and negative persistence exponents , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , in the transient regime .",
    "the values of the steady  state persistence exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 were found to be equal to each other , and equal to @xmath31 within the accuracy of the numerical results . this",
    "is expected because the @xmath20 symmetry is dynamically restored in the steady state of the ( 1 + 1)dimensional kpz equation .",
    "this is , however , a specific feature of the ( 1 + 1)dimensional kpz model , which for nongeneric reasons , turns out to be up  down symmetric in the steady state .",
    "nonlinear surface growth models ( e.g. the higher dimensional kpz model , the nonlinear mbe growth model ) are generically expected to have different values of @xmath32 in both transient and steady  state regimes .    in this paper , we present the results of a detailed numerical study of the persistence behavior of several atomistic , solid  on  solid ( sos ) models of surface growth in ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "while we concentrate on models in the mbe universality class , results for a few other models , some of which have been studied in refs .   and are also presented for completeness .",
    "the highly non  trivial nature of the persistence probability , in spite of a deceptive simplicity of the defining concept , arises from the complex temporal non  locality ( `` memory '' ) inherent in its definition .",
    "in fact , there are very few stochastic problems where an analytical solution for the persistence probability has been achieved . these include the classical brownian motion @xcite , the random acceleration problem @xcite and the one dimensional ising and @xmath6-state potts models @xcite .",
    "in general , the highly nonlocal nature of the temporal correlations in a non  markovian stochastic process makes it extremely difficult to obtain exact results for the persistence probability even for seemingly simple stochastic processes . even for the simple diffusion equation , the persistence exponent is known only numerically , or within an independent interval approximation @xcite or series expansion approach @xcite .",
    "however , it is fairly straightforward in most cases to directly simulate the persistence probability to obtain its stationary power law behavior at large times , and thus to numerically obtain the approximate value of the persistence exponent .",
    "for this reason , we use stochastic ( monte carlo ) simulations of the atomistic growth models to study their temporal persistence behavior in the transient and steady  state regimes .",
    "these models are defined in terms of random deposition and specific cellular ",
    "automaton  type local diffusion or relaxation rules .",
    "some of these models are of the `` limited  mobility '' type in the sense that the surface diffusion rules or local restrictions limit the characteristic length over which a deposited particle can diffuse to just one or a few lattice spacings .",
    "the models in the mbe universality class considered in our study are : the das sarma  tamborenea model  @xcite , the wolf ",
    "villain model  @xcite , the kim ",
    "das sarma model  @xcite and its `` controlled '' version   @xcite , and the restricted solid  on  solid ( rsos ) model of kim _ at al . _",
    "we also present results for the family model  @xcite that is known to belong to the edwards ",
    "wilkinson  @xcite universality class and the restricted solid  on  solid ( rsos ) model of kim and kosterlitz  @xcite that is in the kpz universality class .",
    "the main objective of our study is to examine the effects of the nonlinearity in the mbe growth equation  @xcite on the persistence behavior . unlike the ( 1 + 1)dimensional kpz equation",
    ", the nonlinearity in the mbe growth equation persists in the steady state in the sense that the height profile exhibits a clear asymmetry between the positive and negative directions ( above and below the average height ) .",
    "therefore , the positive and negative persistence exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 are expected to have different values in these models . if this is the case , then the relation between the steady  state persistence exponent and the dynamic scaling exponent @xmath23 found in linear models can not be valid for both @xmath29 and @xmath30 , indicating that at least one of these exponents is a new , nontrivial one not related to the usual dynamic scaling exponents .",
    "the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 and their relation to @xmath23 , as well as the values of the transient persistence exponents @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the primary questions addressed in our study .",
    "we also investigate the universality of these exponents by measuring them for several models that are known to belong in the same universality class as far as their dynamic scaling behavior is concerned . to obtain accurate values of the exponents ,",
    "the `` noise reduction '' technique  @xcite is employed in some of the simulations of ( 1 + 1)dimensional models .",
    "we also address some questions related to the methodology of calculating persistence exponents from simulations . since the value of the dynamical exponent @xmath33 is relatively large for models in the mbe universality class , the time required for reaching the steady state grows quickly as the sample size @xmath34",
    "is increased ( @xmath35 ) . as a result",
    ", it is difficult to reach the steady state in simulations for large @xmath34 .",
    "it is , therefore , useful to find out whether the value of the steady  state persistence exponents can be extracted from calculations of @xmath8 with @xmath36 .",
    "another issue in this context involves the effects of the finiteness of the sample size @xmath34 and the sampling time @xmath37 ( the time interval between two successive measurements of the height profile ) on the calculated persistence probability .",
    "an understanding of these effects is needed for extracting reliable values of the persistence exponents from simulations that _ always _ involve finite values of @xmath34 and @xmath38 .",
    "understanding the effects of @xmath34 and @xmath37 on the persistence analysis is not only important for our simulations , but is also important in the experimental measurements of persistence which invariably involve finite system size and sampling time .",
    "the main results of our study are as follows .",
    "we find that the positive and negative steady  state persistence exponents for growth models in the mbe universality class are indeed different from each other , reflecting the asymmetry of the interface arising from the presence of nonlinearities in the underlying growth equation .",
    "our results for these exponent values are : @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the values of the positive and negative persistence exponents for different models are clearly correlated with the asymmetry of the `` above '' and  below  ( defined relative to the mean interface height ) portions of the interface .",
    "we show analytically that the _ smaller _ one of the two steady - state persistence exponents should be equal to @xmath39 . thus , the relation @xmath40 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for linear surface growth models is expected to be satisfied by @xmath41 for the nonlinear models considered here .",
    "our numerical results are consistent with this expectation : we find that the positive persistence exponent is indeed close to @xmath39 , while the negative one is significantly higher .",
    "similar asymmetry is found for the persistence exponents in the transient regime with @xmath42 in mbe growth . within the uncertainties in the numerically determined values of the exponents , they are universal in the sense that different models in the same dynamic universality class yield very similar values for these exponents . for the models in the edwards  wilkinson and kpz universality classes ,",
    "we find results in agreement with those of earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "our simulations also reveal that a measurement of the steady  state persistence exponents is possible from simulations in which the initial time @xmath12 is much smaller than the time ( @xmath43 ) required for the interfacial roughness to saturate .",
    "a similar result was reported in ref .   where it was found that the steady  state persistence exponent may be obtained from a calculation of @xmath8 with @xmath44 .",
    "we find that the restriction @xmath45 is not necessary for seeing a power law behavior of @xmath46  a power law with the steady  state exponents is found even if @xmath5 is close to or somewhat larger than @xmath12 .",
    "we exploit this finding in some of our persistence simulations for ( 2 + 1)dimensional growth models which are more relevant to experiments .",
    "these results , however , also imply that it would be extremely difficult to measure the transient persistence exponents from real surface growth experiments . finally , we show that the dependence of the steady  state persistence probability on the sample size @xmath34 and the sampling time @xmath37 is described by a simple scaling function of the variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this scaling description is similar to that found recently  @xcite for a different `` persistence probability '' , the survival probability , that measures the probability of the height not returning to its _ average value _",
    "( rather than the initial value ) over a certain period of time .",
    "although the `` persistence '' and the `` survival '' @xcite probability seem to be qualitatively similar in their definitions , the two are mathematically quite unrelated , and in fact , no exponent can be defined for the survival probability . in this paper",
    "we only discuss the persistence probability and the persistence exponent for surface growth processes .",

    "[ fss ] . the final sec .",
    "[ conclude ] contains a summary of our main results and a few concluding remarks .",
    "the dynamic scaling behavior of stochastic growth equations may be classified into several universality classes .",
    "each universality class is characterized by a set of scaling exponents @xcite which depend on the dimensionality of the problem .",
    "these exponents are @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the roughness exponent describing the dependence of the amplitude of height fluctuations in the steady  state regime ( @xmath51 ) on the sample size @xmath34 , @xmath23 is the growth exponent that describes the initial power law growth of the interface width in the transient regime ( @xmath52 ) , and @xmath33 is the dynamical exponent related to the system size dependence of the time at which the interface width reaches saturation .",
    "note that @xmath53 for all the models considered in this paper . to describe the interface evolution we use the single",
    " valued function , @xmath54 , which represents the height of the growing sample at position @xmath55 and deposition time @xmath5 .",
    "the interfacial height fluctuations are described by the root ",
    "mean  squared height deviation ( or interface width ) which is a function of the substrate size @xmath34 and deposition time @xmath5 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the average sample thickness .",
    "the width @xmath58 scales as @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath51 @xcite , @xmath62 being the equilibration time of the interface , when its stationary roughness is fully developed .    since it is convenient to write the evolution equations in terms of the deviation of the height from its spatial average value , @xmath63 , from now on we will denote by @xmath54 the interface height fluctuation measured from the average height .",
    "extensive studies of dynamic scaling in kinetic surface roughening ( for an extended review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) have revealed the existence of ( at least ) four universality classes that are described , in the long wavelength limit , by the following continuum equations and sets of scaling exponents ( @xmath64 ) , shown for the 1 + 1(2 + 1)dimensional cases , respectively :    \\(1 ) the edwards  wilkinson ( ew ) second order linear equation : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 ( 2 ) the kpz second order nonlinear equation : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72    and    \\(4 ) the mbe fourth order nonlinear equation : @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( i=2 , 4 ) and @xmath77 ( j=2 , 22 ) are constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 represents the noise term which accounts for the random fluctuations in the deposition rate .",
    "we assume that the noise has gaussian distribution with zero mean and correlator    @xmath79    d being a constant related to the strength of the bare noise .",
    "note that we do not include the ( trivial ) constant external deposition flux term in the continuum growth equations since that is easily eliminated by assuming that the height fluctuation @xmath80 is always measured with respect to the average interface which is growing at a constant rate .",
    "the concepts of universality classes and scaling exponents have been widely used in the literature to analyze the kinetics of surface growth and fluctuations . our study based on persistence probabilities",
    "is motivated by the possibility that the concept of persistence may provide an additional ( and complementary ) tool to analyze the surface growth kinetics .",
    "it addresses fundamental questions such as : is persistence an independent ( and new ) conceptual tool for studying surface fluctuations or essentially equivalent ( or perhaps complementary ) to dynamic scaling ? and does persistence lead to the definition of new universality classes on the basis of the values of the persistence exponent ? to answer these questions , we consider , for each of the four universality classes mentioned above ( i.e. eqs .",
    "( [ ew_eq])([mbe_eq ] ) ) , at least one growth model and investigate how the associated persistence exponents are related to the dynamic scaling exponents mentioned above .",
    "our goal is to calculate the positive and negative persistence probabilities ( @xmath81 ) for a growing ( fluctuating ) interface in the transient and steady  state regimes . here",
    "@xmath9 is the initial time , and we are interested in evaluating the probability of the height at a fixed position remaining persistently above ( @xmath14 ) or below ( @xmath15 ) its initial value ( i.e. its value at @xmath12 by definition ) during the time period between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . if one considers the special case @xmath82 , when the interface is completely flat , then the quantity of interest is the probability that the interfacial height ( measured from its spatial average ) does not return to its initial zero value up to time @xmath5 .",
    "this case is known as the _ transient _ ( t ) regime .",
    "for values of @xmath5 that are small compared to the time scale for saturation of the interface width ( @xmath83 ) , the persistence probabilities in this regime are expected to exhibit a power law decay in time :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 are called the transient positive and negative persistence exponents . in the particular case of _ linear _ continuum growth equations , these exponents are equal because the symmetry under a change of sign of @xmath86 remains valid at all stages of the growth process .",
    "however , in the case of dynamics governed by nonlinear continuum equations , the lack of this `` up  down ''",
    "interfacial symmetry implies that @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( and therefore , the exponents @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) would , in general , be different from each other .",
    "no universal relationship between the transient positive and negative persistence exponents and the dynamic scaling exponents is known to exist for any one of the four universality classes mentioned above .",
    "on the other hand , if one considers @xmath9 larger than @xmath87 , then the quantity of interest is the probability that the interfacial height at a fixed position does not return to its specific value at initial time @xmath12 during the subsequent time interval between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . instead of being flat ,",
    "the interface morphology at time @xmath9 has completely developed roughness , which produces persistence exponents that are different from the transient exponents defined earlier .",
    "this case is known as the _ steady  state _ ( s ) regime . if @xmath88 , one expects to obtain in this regime the steady  state persistence probability with a power law decay in time @xcite",

( [ noise ] ) ) , where @xmath33 , the dynamical exponent , is here precisely equal to the power of the gradient operator entering the linear continuum dynamical growth equation [ i.e. @xmath94 in eq .

    "this reason we pay particular attention to the mbe nonlinear equation and investigate whether its persistence exponents can be related to the dynamic scaling exponents .",
    "in this paper , we use different atomistic limited  mobility growth models for simulating surface growth processes . in these models ,",
    "the substrate consists of a collection of lattice sites labeled by the index @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and the height variables @xmath98 take integral values .",
    "the term `` limited  mobility '' is meant to imply that in these models , each adatom is characterized by a finite diffusion length which is taken to be one lattice spacing in most of the models we consider here .",
    "thus , a deposited atom can explore only a few neighboring lattice sites according to a set of specific mobility rules before being incorporated into the growing film .",
    "the solid  on  solid constraint is imposed in all these models , so that defects such as overhangs and bulk vacancies are not allowed . in",
    "most of the models considered in this work , the possibility of desorption is neglected , thereby making the models `` conserved '' in the sense that all deposited atoms are incorporated in the film ; the noise ( given by eq .",

    "the deposition process is described by a few simple rules in these models .",

    "the atomistic growth models considered in our work provide discrete realizations of these continuum growth equations .",
    "it is known that some of the discrete growth models we study here have complicated transient behavior @xcite .",
    "for this reason , obtaining the dynamic scaling exponents that show the true universality classes of these models is often quite difficult . to make this task easier , the noise reduction technique @xcite was introduced in simulations of such models .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this technique helps in suppressing high steps in the models and reduces the corrections in the scaling behavior , so that the true asymptotic universality classes of the growth models can be seen in simulations that cover a relatively short time .",
    "this makes it interesting to examine whether the persistence probabilities in these discrete models also exhibit similar transient behavior , and whether the noise reduction technique can help in bringing out the true persistence exponents of these models . to investigate this ,",
    "we have applied the noise reduction technique to some of the discrete models studied in this paper .",

    "in fact , this observation enabled us to calculate the steady  state persistence exponents for ( 2 + 1)dimensional models belonging to the ew and mbe universality classes .",
    "for the mbe universality class , we have considered the dt model and found the positive and negative persistence exponents in the steady  state to be @xmath239 and @xmath240 , respectively , in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "we have also examined in detail the dependence of the measured steady  state persistence probability in the ( 1 + 1)dimensional f model on the sample size @xmath34 and the sampling interval @xmath37 which is always finite in simulations and experimental measurements .",
    "we found that this dependence is described by a simple scaling form .",
    "the scaling function was found to exhibit power law decay with with exponent 1 for times larger than @xmath186 .",
    "we have proposed a simple explanation for this behavior .",
    "we believe that such scaling analysis would prove to be useful in future numerical and experimental studies of persistence properties .",
    "we conclude from the results of this study that persistence probabilities provide a valuable set of tool for investigating the dynamics of nonequilibrium systems in general , and surface growth and fluctuations in particular .",
    "recent experimental studies have shown that the concept of persistence can be applied to analyze the dynamics of fluctuating steps on al / si(111 ) , ag(111 ) and pb(111 ) surfaces @xcite recorded using stm methods .",
    "we believe that in view of the importance of thermal and shot  noise fluctuations in the dynamics of growing and fluctuating interfaces , theoretical and experimental studies of persistence would play an important role in the analysis of the dynamics of nonequilibrium surface growth .",
