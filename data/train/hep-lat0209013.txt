    "-0.2 cm    qcd on @xmath1 anisotropic lattices @xcite has recently proved to be a successful tool for non - perturbative investigation of various interesting physical phenomema ( glueball spectrum , @xmath2 states , gluon strings , spectral density ) . although the method is successful for processes where the hadronic final state is static in the center of mass frame , it is less suited to processes where the hadron momentum in the final state is non - negligible compared to its mass . in such cases independent fine space directions for each momentum degree of freedom are needed to describe the system , increasing dramatically the computational cost and the difficulties linked with tuning the parameters .",
    "however , there exist some interesting physical phenomena , e.g. @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where the final hadron state is either emitted only or strongly peaked at a momentum roughly equal to its mass .",
    "although such systems have been investigated in the @xmath1 case @xcite , a @xmath0 lattice discretization could allow some improvement in the comparison with experimental data , keeping the `` technical '' costs at bay .",
    "study of other high - momentum form factors could also benefit from such a program .",
    "-0.2 cm    starting from the simple @xmath7 plaquette action @xmath8 where the coefficients @xmath9 must be fixed , either non - perturbatively @xcite or perturbatively @xcite , imposing the recovery of lorentz invariance in the continuum limit . in the non - perturbative case",
    "the coefficients are fixed to restore rotational invariance for , say , the static interquark potential . in lattice perturbation theory the tree level terms",
    "are fixed by the naive recovery of the yang - mills lagrangian , while higher order corrections in powers of @xmath10 will be fixed by the symmetries of the renormalized propagator .",
    "the @xmath9 in lattice perturbation theory are defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the asymmetry ratio while @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the coefficients for the fine - fine , fine - coarse and coarse - coarse directions .",
    "applying lattice perturbative calculations also permits a study of the renormalizability of the theory , important not only for its own sake but also for the extraction of physical matrix elements in the decay processes . the hypercubic physical volume @xmath16 is fixed and an ultraviolet cutoff , bigger in the @xmath17 directions @xmath18 , is imposed such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the number of sites in the fine and coarse directions .",
    "the physical limits are then : @xmath21 and @xmath22 keeping @xmath23 fixed .",
    "the aim is to make contact with `` symmetric '' physics , so the procedure is to relate the anisotropic lattice regularization to an asymmetric continuum regularization and from there to a standard continuum regularization .",
    "the procedure is general and holds for any anisotropy , including 3 + 1 .",
    "-0.2 cm    to perform a perturbative renormalization of the theory the different pieces of asymmetric lattice perturbation theory must be established . following the symmetric case , the action for the gauge fixing , faddeev - popov and measure terms are determined .",
    "it will be a general property of feynman rules not to carry , at tree level , explicit dependence from the asymmetry , where a continuum analogue exists .",
    "the only difference resides in the brillouin zones . on the other hand , at the 1-loop level lorentz invariance will be broken .",
    "corrections given by the 1-loop @xmath24 in eq.([cs ] ) are needed to restore it . moreover , a renormalization procedure must be chosen . in analogy with the symmetric case ,",
    "pbc are kept and bphz with a massive gluon propagator as an intermediate infrared regulator is chosen .",
    "contact with continuum theory is straightforward .",
    "feynman rules are better calculated in terms of dimensionless quantities @xmath25 \\ , g a^b_{\\mu}(x ) t^b \\nonumber\\\\ \\sum_n & \\rightarrow & \\frac{1}{\\xi^2 a^4 } \\sum_x\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath26 $ ] will be included according to the value of @xmath27 . in this way",
    "the pure gauge term reads in the continuum limit as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an irrelevant operator and @xmath30\\\\ f_{\\mu\\nu}&=&\\partial^r_{\\mu } a_{\\nu}-\\partial^r_{\\nu } a_{\\mu}+ig[a_{\\mu } , a_{\\nu}]\\\\ \\partial^{r}_{\\mu } \\varphi(x)&=&\\frac{\\varphi(x+a [ \\xi ] \\hat{\\mu})- \\varphi(x)}{a[\\xi]}\\\\ \\hat{\\partial}^{r}_{\\mu } \\varphi(n)&= & \\varphi(n+\\hat{\\mu})- \\varphi(n ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the gauge - fixing term is @xmath31 and the tree - level propagator reads @xmath32 where the only explicit dependence on the asymmetry is carried by @xmath33}\\sin\\bigg(\\frac{a[\\xi ] k_{\\mu}}{2}\\bigg)\\,.\\ ] ] similarly for @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 @xmath37 where ( @xmath38 are the adjoint generators ) : @xmath39 as is clear from above , the @xmath10 measure and the 4-gluon and 2-ghost-2-gluon vertices will carry an explicit dependence on the asymmetry , corresponding to non lorentz 1-loop corrections to @xmath40 .",
    "we refer to a forthcoming paper for the details of the vertices @xcite .",
    "the resulting 1-loop graphs will be polynomials in @xmath41 and functions of the external momenta times integrals @xmath42 @xmath43 which can be simplified by using relations like @xmath44 @xmath45   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the basic integrals are straightforward to evaluate with high numerical precision as a function of @xmath23 , e.g. @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "tadpole improvement is useful to ensure convergence of the perturbative expansion and is implemented by setting @xmath48 results are very encouraging .",
    "the data for the potential with tree level coefficient , including tadpole improvements , already show small breaking of lorentz invariance .",

    "cm    -0.7 cm    preliminary results show that 1-loop corrections are @xmath49 after tadpole subtraction , confirming that analytic control is very important .",
    "-0.2 cm    when including fermions , avoiding @xmath50 discretization errors is the main problem when dealing with asymmetric discretizations @xcite .",
    "to circunvent this we choose a formulation which includes up to @xmath51 derivative terms @xcite .",
    "the fermion action reads @xmath52 where the regular wilson discretization is used for the fine axis while up to @xmath51 order corrections are included in the coarse directions @xcite .",
    "-0.2 cm    we have shown how 2 + 2 lattice qcd can be relevant to useful physics and feasible , although parameter tuning is necessary .",
    "our formulation of lattice perturbation theory gives fine control over renormalization and a framework for the calculation of matrix elements .",
    "moreover , the quark lagrangian can be tuned using the same techniques , allowing interesting prospectives for the method @xcite .",
