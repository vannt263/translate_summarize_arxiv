    "the inflationary paradigm @xcite has been confirmed as the most successful candidate for explaining the physics of the very early universe @xcite .",
    "this sort of scenarios solves some of the puzzles of the standard cosmological model , such as the horizon , flatness and entropy problems , as well as providing for a mechanism to seed structures in the universe .",
    "we study a particular scenario called intermediate inflation @xcite , characterized for the scale factor evolving as @xmath0 . in this model ,",
    "the expansion of the universe is slower than standard de sitter inflation ( @xmath1 ) , but faster than power law inflation ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the intermediate inflationary model was first introduced as an exact solution corresponding to a particular scalar field potential of the type @xmath3 in the slow - roll approximation , where @xmath4 .    on the other hand ,",
    "there has been carried out a less standard theory of gravity , namely scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "the archetypical theory associated with scalar - tensor models is jordan - brans - dicke @xcite .",
    "the jbd theory is a class of model in which the effective gravitational coupling evolves with time .",
    "the strength of this coupling is determined by a scalar field , the so - called jbd field , which tends to the value @xmath5 . in modern context",
    ", jbd theory appears naturally in supergravity models , kaluza - klein theories and in all known effective string actions @xcite .",
    "we present an intermediate inflationary universe model in a jbd theory .",
    "we will write the friedmann field equations , together with the corresponding scalar field equations . the intermediate inflationary period of inflation will be consistently described in the slow - roll approximation .",
    "scalar and tensor perturbations will be expressed in terms of the parameters that appear in our model and these parameters will be constrained by taking into account the wmap seven year data @xcite .",
    "a wide class of non - einstein gravity models can be recast in the action @xcite : @xmath6,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the ricci scalar , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the dilaton and inflaton fields , respectively",

    "we consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric in order to obtain the field equations from the action ( [ bdi1 ] ) .",
    "these equations in the slow - roll regime are given by @xcite : @xmath15    by choosing the ansatz @xmath16 in the jordan - brans - dicke theory we can find a solution to the set of eqs.([bdi13 ] ) : @xmath17 where the subscript @xmath18 denotes values at the beginning of the inflationary epoch , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is an integration constant .",
    "we note that the scale factor in eq.([bdi16 ] ) is a generalization of the scale factor corresponding to intermediate inflation in the einstein theory @xcite , in the case @xmath22 we recover @xmath23 .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite found the same form for @xmath24 when they first studied a cosmological model in a jbd theory , named extended inflation .",
    "observational measurements @xcite constraint the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 to be very small in the jbd theory .",
    "furthermore , the field @xmath11 remains very close to a constant after inflation , in the radiation and matter domination eras @xcite . in order to recover the value of the newtonian gravitational constant after inflation we will consider @xmath11 equals to zero at the end of inflation .",
    "it is well known that an intermediate stage of inflation needs an additional mechanism to bring inflation to an end @xcite .",
    "we will consider that this mechanism starts after @xmath25 e - folds since the beginning of inflation .",
    "we normalize @xmath11 in such a way that after @xmath25 e - folds the value of the field @xmath11 becomes zero , therefore @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the value of @xmath11 remains zero after that time .",
    "we analyze the cosmological scalar perturbations in the longitudinal gauge @xcite .",
    "the perturbed einstein field equations in the slow - roll regime and for non - decreasing adiabatic and isocurvature modes on large scales @xmath27 are given by @xcite : @xmath28    the authors in ref.@xcite have found the solution to the set of eqs.([bdi25])-([bdi27 ] ) to be : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two integration constants related with the initial values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent adiabatic and isocurvature modes , respectively@xcite .",
    "the isocurvature nature of the term proportional to @xmath31 is guaranteed by the fact that the second term in eq.([bdi30 ] ) is vanishingly small after inflation when @xmath34 .    in order to get the spectrum of scalar perturbations",
    "@xcite we calculate the comoving curvature perturbation , @xmath35 , which in this case turns to be @xcite : @xmath36    as we see from eq.([bdi32 ] ) , the term @xmath37 is responsible for the change of @xmath35 during the inflationary stage . for intermediate inflation in a jbd theory",
    "we can calculate @xmath37 for the chosen potential @xcite : @xmath38 here we have used the number of e - folds @xmath39 to describe time evolution because it is more convenient in the subsequent analysis .",
    "we note that the case @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41 , which is expected because for @xmath40 there is only one scalar field driving inflation , and consequently the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath42 remains constant on large scales @xcite .",
    "the current observational constraints bring @xmath9 to an upper limit given by @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "there exist a wide range of @xmath25 for which we can find values for @xmath9 and @xmath44 in the allowed ranges in such a way that @xmath45 .",
    "for example , for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 we get @xmath49 .",
    "given that the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 are related to the initial values of the perturbed fields it is expected they have to be of the same order @xcite , then to impose @xmath45 guarantees that the variation of @xmath35 during inflation due to the presence of isocurvature perturbations is small , i.e. for a given @xmath9 and @xmath44 we can find a maximum @xmath25 value for which @xmath50 desired value .",
    "in the following we will consider that @xmath35 remains constant after a given scale @xmath51 leaves the hubble horizon during inflation .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the mechanism to finish inflation does not modify this result .",
    "in ref.@xcite it is showed that the error in consider the slow - roll approximation instead of the exact solution in calculating @xmath52 is very small .",

    "we note that the presence of a second scalar field during inflation modifies the form of the standard spectrum @xcite , the standard form is recovered when we take the limit @xmath55 .",
    "the scale dependence of the spectrum is characterized by the spectral index @xmath56 whereas the scale dependence of the spectral index is given by the running @xmath57 @xcite , in our model we have : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the standard slow - roll parameters and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are functions of these parameters defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "eqs.([bdmix])-([bdimm7 ] ) reduce to the result in the einstein theory when @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the scalar curvature perturbations , tensor perturbations can also be generated from quantum fluctuations during inflation @xcite .",
    "the tensor perturbations do not couple to matter and consequently they are only determined by the dynamics of the background metric , so the standard results for the evolution of tensor perturbations of the metric remains valid .",
    "the two independent polarizations evolve like minimally coupled massless fields with spectrum @xcite : @xmath65    from eq.([bdi37 ] ) and eq.([bdimm8 ] ) we can determine the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath66 : @xmath67_{t_*}^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     and @xmath44 in the @xmath68 plane .",

    "@xmath75 is well supported by the data .",

    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the curve @xmath78 enters the @xmath70 confidence region for @xmath79 which in terms of the number of e - folds ( at the time when a given scale leaves the horizon ) means @xmath80 for @xmath76 , @xmath81 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "there are not significant differences for the values of @xmath9 considered in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . on the other hand",
    ", we have to consider at least 50 e - folds of inflation to push the perturbations to observable scales @xcite , which seems to exclude models for @xmath73 and @xmath87 .",
    "we have studied in detail the intermediate inflationary scenario in the context of a jbd theory .",
    "this study was realized in the einstein frame , but the physical results have to be interpreted in the jordan physical frame . in this respect , it has been considered that both frames are equivalent , providing that the jbd field varies extremely slowly in the post - inflationary stage of the universe @xcite . in this way",
    ", the adiabatic fluctuations and the tensor perturbations are described equally in both frames .",
    "this allows to obtain explicit expressions for the corresponding power spectrum of the curvature perturbations @xmath88 , tensor perturbation @xmath89 , tensor - scalar ratio @xmath66 , scalar spectral index @xmath90 , and its running @xmath57 .    in this work",
    "the aim has been to study which set of parameters @xmath9 , @xmath44 and @xmath25 allow us to get a dominant contribution of the adiabatic mode to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations . in order to do that we have restricted the maximum number of e - folds allowed by the model , @xmath25 , for a given set of parameters @xmath9 and @xmath44 . for a given value of @xmath9 and @xmath4",
    "we get @xmath91 constant for a specific value of @xmath25 provided the desired precision . on the other hand , we have restricted ourselves to @xmath92 in light of the previous observational constraints on @xmath9 @xcite .      in order to bring some explicit results",
    "we have taken the constraint in the @xmath68 plane coming from the seven - year wmap data .",
    "we have found that the parameter @xmath44 , which initially lies in the range @xmath4 for this model , is well supported by the data as could be seen from fig.[fig2 ] .    on the other hand",
    "we have to consider at least 50 e - folds of inflation to push the perturbations to observable scales @xcite , which seems to exclude models for @xmath73 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , we see that our study has allowed us to put restrictions on the parameters that appear in our model by comparing to the wmap7 results in terms of @xmath68 plane .",
    "we have not considered in this work the incidence of the running of the spectral index in the constraints of the model .    finally in this work , we have not addressed the phenomena of reheating and possible transition to the standard cosmological scenario . a possible calculation for",
