    "furthermore , we use these signal improvements and techniques to study inhomogeneity in the ky5 defect spin and optical properties and extract estimates of the defects sublevel transition rates .",
    "+        the ky5 point defect is a color center in 3c - sic that has been previously demonstrated to exhibit spin and optical properties that are similar to the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond .",
    "@xcite it produces an optical emission band consisting of a zero phonon line ( zpl ) around 1118 nm and a red - shifted phonon sideband extending out to approximately 1300 nm and , like the nv center , its @xmath2 spin ground state can be initialized and read out optically .",
    "spin coherence times ( @xmath3 ) in excess of 20 @xmath4s have been demonstrated for the ground - state spin sublevels of ky5 ensembles .",
    "these states can be manipulated with resonant microwave pulses on fast time scales ( tens of nanoseconds ) even up to room temperature , making ky5 centers a viable candidate for a defect - based spin qubit .",
    "the ky5 center can be controllably generated within the 3c - sic crystal lattice through a combination of radiation damage and subsequent annealing and has been tentatively identified as a neutral divacancy.@xcite due to the availability of 3c - sic as a heteroepitaxial film on silicon , photonic structures with three - dimensional optical confinement can be fabricated by removing the underlying substrate through conventional silicon wet and dry etch processes .",
    "the use of on - chip photonic cavities to enhance defect qubit excitation is analogous to the use of macroscopic enhancement cavities to generate large intracavity optical fields for applications such as high sensitivity absorption spectroscopy in atomic gases@xcite or efficient non - linear optical frequency conversion . in general , for a fixed incident excitation power , the local electric field intensity inside a microcavity scales as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the input power coupling efficiency .",
    "more specifically , temporal coupled - mode theory can be used to calculate the response of a photonic crystal cavity subject to far field excitation by an externally incident gaussian beam , yielding the expression : + @xmath7 + where @xmath8 is the cavity electric field intensity maximum , @xmath9 is the incident beam electric field intensity maximum , @xmath10 is the wavelength of the cavity mode , @xmath11 is the refractive index of the medium surrounding the cavity , @xmath12 is the incident beam waist , and @xmath13 is the cavity index of refraction ( .17ex2.64 for 3c - sic).@xcite alternatively , finite - difference time - domain simulations can be used to directly calculate the steady state response of the cavity to continuous wave excitation .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1](a ) shows the excitation geometry used for simulating the local field enhancement generated in a 300 nm thick l3 cavity for an incident gaussian electric field intensity with unity amplitude and beam waist equal to our experimentally measured value of .17ex1 @xmath4 m .",

    "the cavities consisted of l3 and h1 structures fabricated in 300 nm thick 3c - sic films that were implanted with carbon ions at an energy of 110 kev and annealed at 750@xmath14 c for 30 minutes in order to generate ensembles of ky5 defects .",
    "details of the sample design , fabrication , and characterization are presented in ref .",
    "we primarily focused on l3 designs to observe cavity - enhanced optical excitation due to their greater degree of coupling to far field gaussian modes as compared to the h1 cavities , which were better suited for improved narrowband collection of off - resonantly excited defect pl ( 10 - 20 times improvement over unpatterned thin films ) .",

    "a 1064 nm diode laser was used for off - resonant excitation and a tunable ( 1090 - 1180 nm ) , narrow linewidth ( < 300 khz ) littman - metcalf diode laser was used for resonant photoluminescence excitation and cross - polarized resonant scattering spectroscopy .",
    "samples were mounted with the cavity axis at 45 degrees with respect to the incident laser polarization to allow for the use of the latter technique for control measurements . collected pl and",

    "the photonic crystal extent is delineated by the white dashed lines and the bright spot in its center is fluorescence originating from the cavity .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2](d ) shows the excitation wavelength dependence of the pl count rate originating from the cavity location .",
    "the excitation wavelength - dependent count rate matched the cavity mode spectrum and the peak exhibited an approximately factor of 5 increase over off - resonant excitation .",

    "[ fig : fig2](c ) . + at the excitation wavelength corresponding to the cavity resonance , the pl count rate was approximately @xmath16 30 times higher than the pl count rate from the unpatterned thin film , where we have defined @xmath17 as the ratio of the resonantly excited cavity pl count rate to the thin film pl count rate at the same excitation wavelength and power . for h1 designs",
    ", we observed a lower maximum @xmath18 13 due to a smaller degree of input coupling for an incident gaussian beam .",
    "scattered laser light added a negligible contribution to the measured signal ( see ref .",
    "while we excited cavity modes tuned to the ky5 defect zpl wavelength range , this same approach can be applied to applications that require efficient off - resonant excitation@xcite and would be particularly beneficial for excitation wavelengths that overlap weakly with the defects absorption spectrum .",
    "+ aside from increasing the overall luminescence count rate , cavity resonant excitation can also be used to improve measurements on single emitters or ensembles by exciting a significantly smaller sample volume than a standard objective lens configuration .",
    "the excitation volume of a thin film is greatly reduced as compared to that of bulk material because the excitation volume dimension along the optical axis is set by the thickness of the thin film rather than the diffraction limit ( .17ex10 @xmath4 m for a .7 na objective at @xmath10=1.1 @xmath4 m ) . furthermore",
    ", for our optical configuration , the cavity provides a further 12.4-fold reduction in the sample excitation volume as compared to the thin film , resulting in an overall 705-fold reduction as compared to bulk material.@xcite this reduction in the excitation of localized states in the proximity of isolated single emitters within the surrounding material can improve the performance of single photon sources by reducing background fluorescence@xcite or charge - induced spectral diffusion.@xcite",
    "the observed signal improvements provide a means to greatly increase the odmr signal amplitude in order to probe the ky5 center s spin - dependent electronic structure or for sub - diffraction limit , on - chip sensing applications . in order to perform spin - dependent measurements on defects within the cavity structure",
    ", we performed an additional fabrication step that adds a 10 nm/300 nm ti / au metallization layer to the sample surface for applying intense local microwave fields to the sample .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] ( a ) shows an optical image of an array of released 3c - sic films patterned with photonic crystal cavities next to a 50 @xmath4 m wide microstrip positioned 50 @xmath4 m away from the structures . due to the robustness of the approximately 40 @xmath4 m by 40 @xmath4 m freestanding films , the metallization can be applied prior to or after the membrane release step without the need for critical point drying .",
    "we used on - chip microstrips in order to apply sufficiently intense microwave fields to achieve coherent spin manipulation ( rabi oscillations ) on time scales faster than the ky5 defects @xmath19 of .17ex 50 ns.@xcite + figure",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) compares the ky5 odmr signal ( @xmath20 ) with the excitation beam incident on the released 3c - sic thin film ( black line and dots ) and the photonic crystal cavity ( red line and dots ) for the same optical power at zero magnetic field .",
    "the overall odmr signal increase matches the pl count rate increase observed for this cavity ( @xmath21 20 ) , confirming that the pl count rate increases under resonant excitation originate from defect pl rather than scattered excitation .",
    "similar improvements were observed for pulsed odmr signals , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](c ) . by synchronizing pulsed optical excitation to polarize and readout the spin ensemble with pulsed microwaves for spin manipulation , we observed rabi oscillations between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 spin sublevels of the defects ground states for emitters excited via the cavity mode or in the unpatterned thin film .",
    "for pulsed odmr measurements , signal is greatly increased under resonant excitation due to a combination of both higher pl count rates and faster optical pumping .",
    "+ ceple spectroscopy on the inhomogeneously broadened zpl of ensembles can greatly increase measurement signal intensities and reduce the number of measured emitters to facilitate studies of the optical and spin inhomogeneity that we observe for defects in 3c - sic thin films.@xcite @xcite @xcite for high - emitter - density samples ( @xmath24 ions @xmath25 implantation dose ) like those measured in the fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we observed variations in the defect ground - state zero field splitting ( d @xmath26 1.32 ghz ) of up to 10 mhz and variations in the ensemble odmr linewidth by almost a factor of 2 as the excitation wavelength is varied within the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble zpl ( fwhm of 28.2 nm ) . for lower - density samples ( @xmath27 ions @xmath25 dose ) ,",
    "the 10 - 20 times improvement of collection efficiency @xcite for defects emitting into the cavity mode reveals pl lines as narrow as 25 ghz within the inhomogeneously broadened zpl ( 28.2 nm fwhm @xmath26 6.7 thz ) .",
    "these emission lines were also observed with ceple spectroscopy for significantly lower excitation powers ( 1.5 @xmath4w vs. 3.2 mw ) and higher pl count rates ( .17ex1,400 cts / s vs. .17ex200 cts / s ) as compared to narrowband pl collection of the emission line using a scanning monochromator.@xcite exciting and collecting pl from a reduced mode volume facilitates the isolation of a smaller number of spectral lines within a given wavelength range because this spectral fine structure and its polarization can vary throughout the thin film , likely due to variations in the local crystalline environment .",
    "in addition to providing increased signal intensities , the excitation enhancement provided by the resonant cavity mode can also be used to increase the rate of optically - induced spin polarization in the ky5 defects ground state . to observe this process , we measured the defects time - dependent pl intensity in response to variable - length laser pulses with interleaved microwave @xmath28 pulses driving the @xmath22 to @xmath29 ground - state spin sublevel transitions .",
    "a series of optical pulses with a variable length from 250 to 1500 ns were applied to excite the ky5 defects from the ground state to the excited state where they experience either spin - conserving radiative recombination or spin - dependent relaxation to the ground - state spin sublevels predominantly via the intersystem crossing ( isc ) transitions.@xcite as a result of this relaxation pathway , optical excitation achieves ground - state spin polarization at a rate that depends on the optical excitation pulse length and field intensity .",
    "relaxation through the isc transitions also provides a means for reading out the spin state : for a period of time immediately after the turn - on of the optical pulse , the ky5 defects will fluorescence more or less brightly depending on the ground - state spin polarization immediately prior to the optical pulse . accordingly , we collected the pl for a fixed time period of 100 ns immediately after the turn - on of the optical pulse to obtain a measure of the spin polarization generated by the previous pulse .",
    "prior to half of the optical pulses , we applied a microwave @xmath28 pulse to invert the ground - state spin polarization , which was then re - pumped to the steady state polarization by the subsequent optical excitation .",
    "we measured this difference in pl ( pl@xmath30pl@xmath31 ) between optical pulses that immediately followed a @xmath28 pulse and those that did not to obtain a measure of the ground - state spin polarization .",
    "the optical excitation was turned off for at least 500 ns prior to microwave manipulation and readout to allow for population within the isc levels to fully relax to the ground state .",
    "see @xcite for pulse sequences and further details .",
    "+ the same model used to explain the pl dynamics of the nv center in diamond can be applied to model the expected dynamics.@xcite figure [ fig : fig4](a ) shows the results of numerical simulations of the time - dependent difference in pl between an nv center that has been initially prepared in the @xmath22 state and the @xmath29 states for two excitation rates differing by a factor of 3 .",
    "the figure also depicts the measurement scheme described above and the approximately exponential decay of the pl difference curves for laser pulse lengths longer than the collection time ( red lines ) .",
    "this behavior corresponds to an approximately exponentially saturating ground - state spin polarization and pl difference signal .",
    "we observed corresponding behavior when comparing the laser pulse length - dependent pl difference signal for ky5 defects excited within the thin film with those excited using the photonic crystal cavity mode , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4](b ) also shows the results of numerical simulations of this difference signal for varying laser pulse lengths .",
    "the observed saturation behavior matches the predicted dynamics for intersystem crossing rates that differ from the nv center , as determined from a nonlinear least squares fit to a numerical model that includes the expected excitation enhancement ( @xmath8/@xmath9 .17ex96 ) for this structure geometry.@xcite the enhanced excitation rate for defects within the cavity structure generates a faster rate of ground - state spin initialization corresponding to a shorter time constant @xmath32 . the time constant associated with this approximately exponential saturation of the pl difference signal decreases from 500 @xmath33 55 ns to 280 @xmath33 20 ns .",
    "this approximately factor of 2 difference in the time constant for optical pumping is relatively small as compared to the overall pl count rate increase ( .17ex20x ) because for high excitation rates , the spin initialization rate becomes limited by the transition rate to the intersystem crossing levels rather than the rate of optical cycling . as a control measurement to verify the spin - dependent origin of these dynamics , we removed the microwave @xmath28 pulse and observed no difference signal .",
    "@xcite + these measurements provide the first direct observation of spin - dependent pl dynamics in sic and support previous assumptions that these defects exhibit optical dynamics similar to the nv center in diamond .",
    "furthermore , we corroborated the variable length laser pulse results using tcspc methods and observed a spin - dependent pulsed odmr contrast of 2.75% . by combining this value with the numerical modeling",
    ", we estimate an intrinsic spin - dependent pulsed odmr contrast of 4.9% for ideal measurement parameters",
    "( for details , see ref .",
    "while this value is lower than typically observed for single nv centers , it is similar to what has been previously observed for high density nv center ensembles and single defects in sic .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated resonant excitation of 3c - sic photonic crystal cavities with integrated defect spins for large pl and odmr signal enhancements and increased spin initialization rates .",
    "our analysis shows that our present cavity designs are capable of achieving localized optical field intensities that can be enhanced by a factor of almost 200 relative to an incident gaussian beam .",
    "this value could be further improved with concurrent optimization of cavity q and coupling to the gaussian excitation mode.@xcite for measurements of ensembles of defects , these small mode volumes and excitation intensity enhancements may facilitate on - chip applications that are limited by inefficient optical coupling or poor spectral overlap of the excitation source and defect absorption bands .",
    "these applications include spin ensemble - based sensing techniques using on - chip optical traps,@xcite enhanced absorption for hole - burning experiments,@xcite or for enhancing the signal of spectrally distinct sub - ensembles in order to study inhomogeneous broadening.@xcite for applications involving single defects , cavity resonant excitation can provide enhanced optical stark shifts,@xcite compact , on - chip single photon frequency conversion,@xcite or reduced excitation of background impurities that are detrimental to single photon source performance.@xcite @xcite additionally , we have provided evidence that defects in 3c - sic exhibit photodynamics similar to those of the nv center in diamond .",
    "these results underscore the benefits of fabricating devices with integrated defect spin states in heteroepitaxial 3c - sic as a means to incorporate defect qubits into scalable device architectures for applications in the field of quantum information and sensing .",
