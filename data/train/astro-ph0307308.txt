    "we observed long - term behavior of v803 cen , and confirmed that it displays at least two different states of outburst activity : ( 1 ) state with outbursts with a supercycle of @xmath777 d , which is very reminiscent of the 46.3-d supercycle in cr boo , and ( 2 )  standstill \"- like state with oscillations with a time - scale of @xmath71 d. these two state interchangeably appear with a time - scale of 12 yr . during the bright outburst in 2003 june",

    "this outburst was composed of distinct states : ( 1 ) initial peak lasting for @xmath73 d with a slow linear decline , ( 2 ) a  dip \"- like transient fading , ( 3 ) oscillating ( or rebrightening ) stage which resembles the  standstill \"- like state but with a gradual overall fading .",

    ", we detected large - amplitude superhump - type variation with a period of 0.018686(4 ) d = 1614.5(4 ) s , and during the oscillation stage , we detected variations with a period of 0.018728(2 ) d = 1618.1(2 ) s but with a smaller and variable amplitude .",
