    "the concepts and tools of classical field theory are useful for a large class of physical systems ranging from the electromagnetic field to bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . for instance , in the context of the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) theory of phase transitions , the free - energy density as a functional of the order parameter ( the expectation value of the quantum field operator for a bec ) maps to the same form as the energy density functional of a classical field .",
    "classical solutions minimizing the energy density functional of such models play an important role also in quantum field theory , as well as in high energy physics , and cosmology .",
    "real time soliton solutions give rise to particle - like structures , such as magnetic monopoles , and extended structures , such as domain walls and cosmic strings , that have implications for the cosmology of the early universe @xcite . with respect to their dynamical characteristics ,",
    "the classical field solutions can be both static or travelling solitons @xcite , as well as oscillons ( alias breathers ) .",
    "oscillons , are long - lived configurations localized in space and periodic in time .",
    "such localized structures can be found in many physical systems , ranging from granular media @xcite to water waves @xcite .",
    "additionally , oscillons have also been extensively studied in the context of field theory , and can be found both in scalar @xcite , and abelian or non abelian gauge theories @xcite .",
    "atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite offer a setting where a large variety of classical field solutions ( relevant to elementary gauge fields @xcite or even to cosmological black holes @xcite ) , can be studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "thus , the search for classical field solutions and their phenomenological impact , nowadays appears to gain an increased attention .",
    "a prototype system of such a classical field emerges when one restricts himself to a mean - field treatment of the gorkov - eliashberg - landau - ginzburg approach of superconductivity @xcite . in this case",
    ", the order parameter is the expectation value of an electron - pair creation operators which , for the simple case of s - wave pairing , behaves as a complex field @xmath0 .",
    "the emerging effective field theory is an abelian - higgs model , where the higgs field is the pair condensate order parameter , and the abelian field is the electromagnetic field .",
    "this explains in a rather straightforward manner the meissner effect ( the fact that the magnetic field only penetrates the superconductor within a finite penetration depth ) through the now called higgs mechanism , namely : the appearance of the condensate spontaneously breaks the @xmath1 symmetry , giving rise to a finite mass to the gauge field .",
    "the existence of this gap ( or mass ) also ensures the phenomenon of perfect conductivity , through the collective dynamics of the condensed cooper pair electrons . there is a considerable amount of works in the literature related to the search of classical solutions in this model ( abelian - higgs ) , mainly in the context of localized and/or topologically charged forms .",
    "the existence of such solutions depends strongly on the space dimensionality . in two spatial dimensions ,",
    "abelian - higgs models have vortex solutions ( e.g. , the nielsen - olesen vortex @xcite ) , which carry a non - vanishing topological charge , and play an important role in many aspects of contemporary physics ( for example the abrikosov vortices in landau - ginzburg theory of superconductivity @xcite ) . when time - dependence is taken into account , oscillon solutions can be found both in @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite dimensions .",
    "recently , it was shown that oscillons can emerge dynamically from vortex - antivortex annihilation @xcite , highlighting the fact that oscillon dynamics are intriguing , and may play a crucial role in many areas of physics featuring symmetry breaking , ranging from superfluids and superconductors to cosmology .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the classical dynamics of the abelian - higgs model in @xmath4-dimensions by means of a multiscale expansion method @xcite .",
    "we restrict our analysis on the case of small fluctuations of the condensate about its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "this is realized by choosing the amplitude of the higgs field to be an order of magnitude smaller than that of the gauge field .",
    "employing the method of multiple scales ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the original nonlinear coupled field equations are reduced to an effective nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation for the gauge field , and a linear equation for the higgs field containing the gauge field as a source .",
    "these equations are analytically solved giving two types of localized solutions for the gauge field , namely in the form of oscillons and oscillating kinks .",
    "subsequently , we numerically integrate the original equations of motion using , as initial conditions , the analytically found solutions .",
    "we find that the analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical findings for a large range of values of the parameters involved .",
    "we then discuss connections between the abelian - higgs model solutions and the phenomenology of superconducting materials , describing the temporal fluctuations of the condensate in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) josephson junction  @xcite due to the presence of oscillating ( in time ) magnetic and electric fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the general formalism of the abelian - higgs model and we derive the equations of motion for the gauge and the scalar fields .",
    "we then use the method of multiple scales to reduce the equations of motion to the nls system , and present the corresponding analytical solutions . in section",
    "iii we present results of direct numerical integration of the original equations of motion to check the validity of our approximations and study the stability of our solutions .",
    "finally , in section iv , we present our concluding remarks and make connections with the context of superconductors .",

    "( [ eq : eq4])-([eq : eq5 ] ) , are valid in the case of the unitary gauge . in a different gauge , the simplification would still be approximately valid , as long as the goldstone fluctuations @xmath43 , are sufficiently smaller than the higgs field @xmath44 or slowly - varying with respect to the spatial variables . however , if the goldstone fluctuations become significant , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq4])-([eq : eq5 ] ) should be modified to incorporate a phase field as well as more gauge field components .",
    "in such a case , it is clear that a solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq4])-([eq : eq5 ] ) ( such as the ones that we will present below ) will not satisfy the full system .",

    "one could , in principle , write down the form of the magnetic and electric fields originating from the gauge field @xmath56 which was chosen to be in the @xmath172 direction : @xmath173 , and @xmath174 . in the case of the oscillon solutions given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eq14])-([eq : eq15 ] ) , the above equations describe the electric field in he @xmath175 direction , which produces a magnetic field in the @xmath176 direction ; both fields are localized around the origin of the @xmath27 axis  cf .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where the profiles of the fields are shown .",
    "this can be thought of as a configuration , describing superconductor  normal metal  superconductor ( sns ) josephson junction  @xcite , where two superconductors are linked by a thin normal conductor placed at the origin .",
    "then , our solutions describe a condensate @xmath177 that oscillates around its vev near the origin , and acquires its vev value when entering the superconductors .",
    "accordingly , the magnetic field is shown to oscillate inside the normal conductor , but vanishes exponentially inside the superconductors as per the meissner effect .",
    "we would like to add that these oscillon solutions are different from the phase - slip solutions which correspond to `` electric '' flux quantization in close loops in one - time one - space dimensions .",
    "the latter solutions correspond to an integer number of electric flux quanta through a space - time loop @xcite and they are topological singularities which correspond to the change of the phase of the condensate order parameter by a multiple of @xmath178 when we `` travel '' around such a loop once .",
    "oscillons on the other hand are soliton solutions which are created by small - amplitude excitations around the ( superconducting ) vacuum with the spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "we note that it may be easier to observe such oscillon solutions more directly in rotating superfluids and , in particular , in atomic bose - einstein condensates of trapped ultra - cold bosonic atoms or in optical lattices in their superfluid phase .",
    "the same u(1)-higgs classical field theory may describe the dynamics of the condensate order parameter , where the role of the external magnetic field is played by the local angular momentum of the rotating superfluid .",
    "our approach not only reveals a new class of solutions of the abelian - higgs model , but also dictates a straightforward general strategy for the search of non - trivial dynamics in models involving classical fields with nonlinear interactions .",
    "it is a natural perspective to determine the impact of these solutions on the thermal and quantum behaviour of the involved fields .",
    "additionally , it would be extremely interesting to study the persistence and possible bifurcations of the solutions presented in this work in the presence of the goldstone mode and additional components of the gauge field .",
    "in such a case , other nontrivial structures may emerge , whose stability and dynamics deserve to be investigated in detail .",
    "still another interesting direction is the consideration of higher - dimensional settings .",
    "such studies are currently in progress and relevant results will be reported elsewhere .",
