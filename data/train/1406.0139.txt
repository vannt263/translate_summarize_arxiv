    "when arriving at the cortex from the sensory periphery , sensory signals are further processed by local recurrent networks .",
    "indeed , the vast majority of all the connections a cortical neuron receives are from the cortical networks within which it is embedded and only a small fraction of connections are from feedforward afferents : the fraction of recurrent connections has been estimated to be as large as @xmath0 @xcite . what is the precise role of this recurrent network in sensory processing is not yet fully clear .    in the primary visual cortex of mammals like carnivores and primates , for instance",
    ", it has been proposed that the recurrent network might be mainly responsible for the amplification of orientation selectivity @xcite .",
    "only a small bias provided by the feedforward afferents would be enough , and selectivity is then amplified by a non - linear mechanism implemented by the recurrent network .",
    "this mechanism is a result of the feature - specific connectivity assumed in the model , where neurons with similar input selectivities are connected to each other with a higher probability .",
    "this , in turn , could follow from the arrangement of neurons in orientation maps @xcite , which implies that nearby neurons have similar preferred orientations . as nearby neurons are also connected with a higher likelihood than distant neurons",

    "each neuron receives a heterogeneous input from pre - synaptic sources with different preferred orientations @xcite .",
    "although an over - representation of connections between neurons of similar preferred orientations has been reported in rodents @xcite , presumably as a result of a hebbian growth process during a later stage of development @xcite , such feature - specific connectivity is not yet statistically significant immediately after eye opening @xcite .",
    "a comparable level of orientation selectivity , however , has indeed been reported already at this stage @xcite .",
    "if cortical recurrent networks make a contribution to sensory processing at this stage , random recurrent networks should be chosen as a model @xcite .",
    "activity - dependent reorganization of the network , however , may still refine the connectivity and improve the performance of the processing later during development .    here",
    "we study the distribution of orientation selectivity in random recurrent networks with heterogeneous synaptic projections , i.e.  networks where the recurrent connectivity does not depend on the preferred feature of the input to the neurons .",
    "we show that in structurally homogeneous networks , the heterogeneity in functional connectivity , i.e.  the heterogeneity in preferred orientations of recurrently connected neurons , is indeed responsible for a broad distribution of selectivities .",
    "a linear analysis of the network operation can account quite precisely for this distribution , for a wide range of network topologies including erds - rnyi random networks and networks with distance - dependent connectivity .",

    "[ fig_instab]c , third column ) and orientation selectivity index ( fig .",
    "[ fig_instab]c , fourth column ) .",
    "note that a consequence of this clustering of po is a degenerate representation of orientation selectivity , i.e.  not all orientations are represented equally in the network . while the distribution of output pos is almost uniform in the network with local inhibition ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig_instab]c , third column ) , clear peaks are present in the distribution of output pos in the network with local excitation ( inset in fig .",

    "we presented a linear analysis , which was capable of predicting the distribution of orientation selectivity in networks with different patterns of random connectivity , including some degree of spatial organization , and for a wide range of parameters .",
    "the effective strength of excitation and inhibition in the network ( figs .",
    "[ fig_er ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_er_rec ] ) , as well as the spatial extent of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diffext ] ) , did not affect the prediction accuracy very strongly , as long as the linearized dynamics remained stable .",
    "we therefore conclude that linear mechanisms are the major network operations that explain amplification and attenuation , and the distribution of the resulting orientation selectivity in our networks , within their stable regimes of linearized dynamics .",
    "note that even in networks with localized connectivity of excitation and/or inhibition , the linearized dynamics remained stable for a vast set of parameter combinations .",
    "even when excitation was highly local and clustered , as long as inhibition had the same spatial connectivity profile , stability of the network was guaranteed . a similar conclusion has been recently obtained from an analysis of spatially embedded balanced networks @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown before that networks with distance - dependent connectivity can show the same macroscopic behavior similar to random networks without local connectivity @xcite .",
    "the asynchronous irregular ( ai ) state has been argued to best match the activity of cortical networks _ in vivo _",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the relevance of this regime has only been discussed , however , for cortical networks in response to uniform stimulation . on the other hand , with regard to the processing of a non - uniformly modulated input , it has been claimed that a `` marginal state of recurrent dynamics '' might be the relevant regime of operation for the processing of weakly tuned inputs @xcite . also , it has recently been suggested that a recurrent regime with `` macroscopic chaos '' ( probably corresponding to our regime of unstable dynamics ) might be advantageous for sensory processing , as it may support a better separation of trajectories @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these proposals , the results of our study suggest that a stable ai state of of dynamics might indeed be the relevant regime of operation also for sensory processing in cortical networks in response to tuned inputs .",
    "notably , the dense and local pattern of inhibition in real cortical circuits @xcite is in line and consistent with our proposal .",
    "it might indeed be a general strategy biological networks of spiking neurons have exploited to ensure their overall stability to modulated inputs .",
    "we note again that we are talking about dynamic stability here , where the network dynamics is linearized about the uniform asynchronous - irregular state , and the effective weights of coupling linearized about this baseline state are considered .",
    "a broad distribution of orientation selectivity is reported across all cortical layers in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys @xcite , as well as in mice @xcite ( for a comparison of the distributions , see panel c in fig .",
    "s2 therein ) .",
    "although we chose random connectivities by fixing the in - degree of all neurons ( which we refer to as `` structural homogeneity '' ) , a broad distribution of orientation selectivities also emerged in all our networks .",
    "the main contributor to this broad distribution was , therefore , not the structural heterogeneity of synaptic connectivity .",
    "in fact , there is no heterogeneity at all , if one only considers the number of connections each neuron receives from pre - synaptic excitatory and inhibitory neurons nor were the temporal fluctuations of activity generated by our networks a major source of this variability , although the networks were mostly operated in the fluctuation - driven regime with high amounts of temporal and trial - by - trial variability .",
    "as we have generally chosen a homogeneous connectivity pattern , this temporal variance would be essentially the same for all neurons , at least in the baseline state .",
    "( this also justifies the mean - field ansatz we have employed for our analysis . )",
    "this is again reflected in the narrow distribution of f0 components in all our networks .",
    "the main source of variability in orientation selectivity is rather the `` functional heterogeneity '' in synaptic connectivity , namely heterogeneous preferred features ( here , preferred orientations of inputs ) of the pre - synaptic sources within the recurrent network .",
    "receiving input from neurons with different preferred features may be a computational strategy to integrate the information , and help to remove distractive correlations in the activity .",
    "the fact that each neuron within the recurrent network receives input from a heterogeneous pool of neurons with a wide range of preferred orientations leads to a random `` summation '' of pre - synaptic preferred orientations , which eventually changes the output preferred orientation of the post - synaptic neuron @xcite .",
    "the quenched noise of preferred orientations , and not structural or dynamic fluctuations , is , therefore , the main mechanism responsible for the distribution of orientation selectivity in our networks .",
    "we showed that even with this most conservative estimate of neuronal heterogeneity , consistent with recent experiments @xcite , a broad distribution of neuronal selectivities can be obtained .",
    "however , we can not rule out a possible contribution of other sources of heterogeneity , like heterogeneous connectivity and heterogeneous amounts of excitation and inhibition different neurons may receive in their baseline state ( leading to different levels of spontaneous activity , see e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as variability in neuron parameters @xcite and synaptic noise . also , heterogeneity in the pattern of feedforward projections to neurons in v1",
    "can be a prominent source of distribution in orientation selectivity .",
    "however , if the distribution of orientation selectivity is mainly dominated by feedforward heterogeneity , or / and if single neuron heterogeneities like variability in threshold and synaptic noise are the main source of this distribution , the distribution should not much change when the recurrent network is absent . on the other hand , if functional heterogeneity resulting from recurrent interactions is a major contributor to this distribution , it should get narrowed when the intra - cortical circuitry is deactivated .",
    "it therefore awaits further experimental tests which mechanisms are dominant in creating the distribution of feature - selectivity in the cortex .",
    "there are several ways in which the the current study could be expanded .",
    "first , sticking to a linear framework of analysis enabled us to analytically compute the distribution of orientation selectivity . in this simplified framework , however , we neglected several nonlinearities , both at the level of neuronal properties and network interactions .",
    "these nonlinearities are deemed to be more prominent in biological networks , for instance in the form of rectification @xcite , or an expansive - compressive transfer nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "such mechanisms might play a major role in sharpening and amplification of orientation selectivity .",
    "a more complete theoretical treatment of the problem should therefore consider the contribution of nonlinear mechanisms as well , although this may come at the expense of less rigorous analytical predictions .",
    "one way to embrace additional nonlinear mechanisms that are effective in biological networks , at least at the level of simulations , is to use a more realistic and more detailed neuron model . in our simulations here",
    "we used the current - based lif neuron model .",
    "simulating networks of more realistic neuron models , like conductance - based lif neurons , may change certain behaviors of the network @xcite .",
    "for instance , increasing the recurrent coupling in our inhibition - dominated networks can decrease the mean membrane potential of neurons in the network to very negative values , as there is no reversal potential limiting it .",
    "this is not the case in a conductance - based neuron model , and therefore a network of that sort might show a different behavior , especially when operated in extreme regimes .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to see how the predictions of our current theory change when one considers networks with feature - specific connectivity .",
    "this scenario might be corresponding to species with orientation maps , where neighboring neurons tend to have a similar preferred orientation @xcite , or to species without spatial map of selectivity , but with feature - specific functional connectivity @xcite .",
    "a linear amplification of feedforward input , for instance , has been recently reported in cortical circuits of mice @xcite . how this effect could be modeled within our theoretical framework , and how it affects the distribution of orientation selectivity ,",
    "should therefore be a next step in our research .",
