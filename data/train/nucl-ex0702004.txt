    "ultra - relativistic p+a collisions are used to understand the initial state effects in heavy - ion collisions , which may have produced deconfined nuclear matter @xmath3 . by the measurement of hadrons produced in relativistic d+au and p+p collisions over a wide range of rapidity , one can try to disentangle the modification of the parton distributions in nuclei ( e.g. shadowing ) and the change of @xmath4 spectra of produced particles caused by initial and final state multiple scattering in cold nuclear matter ( e.g. cronin effect @xmath5 ) and thus constrain various dynamical evolution scenarios and initial conditions ( e.g. color glass condensate @xmath6 ) .",
    "experimental data from d+au collisions at rhic from the brahms , phenix and star collaborations @xmath7 has verified the prediction of the cronin effect at mid - rapidity , i.  e. the enhancement of intermediate-@xmath4 hadrons in d+au collisions as compared to p+p , which might be due to the initial state multiple parton scattering . at forward rapidity",
    "@xmath8 the suppression of hadron spectra is consistent with predictions by the cgc model @xmath9 .",
    "the cronin enhancement at mid - rapidity and the high-@xmath4 suppression at forward rapidity are characterized by the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 , which is defined as a ratio of the invariant particle spectra from d+au collisions to reference spectra in p+p collisions scaled by the average number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in d+au ( @xmath10 ) :    @xmath11",
    "brahms ( broad range hadron magnetic spectrometers ) has two rotatable magnetic spectrometers with particle identification capabilities for charged hadrons , which allow the study of particle production in a broad range of both transverse momenta and rapidities .",

    "only the spectra of positive particles are shown .",
    "spectra at different rapidities are scaled for clarity . ]",
    "brahms uses the time - of - flight ( tof ) technique in the mid - rapidity spectrometer ( mrs ) and the forward spectrometer ( fs ) and a ring imaging erenkov ( rich ) detector at the back of the fs for the identification of particles with high momentum . in this",
    "analysis pions and kaons are separated up to 1.8  gev / c in momentum by the tof in the mrs , and the separation of pions and kaons in the fs has been extended up to 25 - 30  gev / c by the rich .",
    "details on the brahms detector system can be found in  @xcite .",
    "spectra in both the mrs and the fs spectrometers have been corrected for geometric acceptance , tracking and pid efficiencies , in - flight decay , absorption and multiple scattering .",
    "the normalization is done relative to the number of events in minimum bias data triggered by the global detectors , and several settings are combined .",
    "weak decays and feed - down have not been corrected for the protons and anti - protons .",
    "the resulting invariant spectra in p+p collisions at different rapidities are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",

    "the nuclear modification factor ( figure  [ fig : rdau ] ) for identified particles at forward rapidity in minimum bias d+au collisions was constructed using @xmath15 . a clear suppression for @xmath16 is observed and @xmath1 reaches @xmath17 at @xmath18  gev / c . the suppression of @xmath16 is comparable to that for negative hadrons @xmath19 where negative pions are the main contribution @xmath20 .",
    "kaons show a similar suppression while protons cross @xmath21 ( no suppression ) at @xmath22gev / c .",
    "the rapidity dependence of the net - proton yield in d+au and p+p collisions may shed light on the stopping and baryon number transport process in nuclear collisions .",
    "the net - proton transverse momentum spectra are constructed by subtracting the anti - proton spectra from the proton spectra @xmath4-bin - by-@xmath4-bin . due to our limited acceptance at low transverse momenta",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) , the yields at low @xmath4 have to be determined by fitting to the data a fit - function and extrapolating the function to low @xmath4 . within our acceptance both a boltzmann function and",
    "an exponential in @xmath4 describe the data equally well .",
    "therefore , both function were used for the extrapolation which results in a lower ( boltzmann ) and upper ( exponential in @xmath4 ) limit for the integrated yield .",
    "the functions were extrapolated to the low @xmath4 region to calculate the integrated yield at low @xmath4 , which was then combined with the yield calculated from data by summing up the @xmath4-bins in order to obtain the total net - proton rapidity density over the full @xmath4 range .",
    "figure  [ fig : netproton ] shows the net - proton rapidity distribution in p+p collisons at 200  gev and a comparison to pythia @xmath23 and the hijing model with baryon junction @xmath24 including single diffractive processes .",
    "the squares are the results of a boltzmann extrapolation , while the dots represent those from an exponential function in @xmath4 .    .",
    "the gray boxes between the two sets of extrapolations indicate the range of solutions which can not be distinguished by our data . ]",
    "the region around mid - rapidity ( between 0 and 1 ) is almost baryon - free , while a large net - proton density is observed at forward rapidity ( around 3 ) . even though we have an uncertainty of about 50% due to the extrapolation procedure hijing / b s estimate is closer to our data , while pythia s is systematically lower at mid - rapidity and higher at forward .",
