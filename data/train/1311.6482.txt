    "understanding the internal structure of strongly interacting particles is one of the major goals of low - energy qcd .",
    "the study of the response of baryons to an external electromagnetic field via the multipole excitation mechanism provides direct access to the internal structure .    the parameters to describe that response are electric , magnetic , and spin - dependent polarizabilities .",
    "the polarizability is an elementary structure constant that is related to the deformation and stiffness of the baryon .",
    "furthermore , the physical content of the polarizabilities is an effective multipole interaction for the coupling of the electric and magnetic fields of the photon with the internal structure of the baryon  @xcite .",
    "evaluation of the electric @xmath4 and magnetic @xmath5 polarizabilities of the nucleon has attracted much attention , both phenomenological and theoretical .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the polarizabilities gives information on the polarization density in the nucleon .",
    "the @xmath0-evolution of the sum of both polarizabilities can be determined through the generalized baldin sum rule  @xcite , namely @xmath6 where @xmath0 is four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath7 is the fine structure constant , @xmath8 stands for the nucleon mass , and @xmath1 is the nucleon structure function . here",
    "@xmath9 is the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the invariant mass of the final state , and @xmath12 corresponds to pion threshold .",
    "this implies that @xmath1 should be taken up to an infinite energy .",
    "indeed it is necessary to use quite reliable models for the @xmath11-dependence as well as @xmath0-dependence of the structure function in order to reduce the uncertainty of the sum rule evaluation .",
    "equation  ( [ esr ] ) provides information about the @xmath0-evolution of the polarizabilities .",
    "an evaluation of the @xmath0-dependence of the sum of electric and magnetic polarizabilities was done in 2006 by liang _",
    "et al . _",
    "there was not much data on the @xmath1 structure function in the relevant kinematic region at that time . at high energies",
    "the slac rosenbluth data  @xcite were used . in the resonance region the e94 - 110 measurements  @xcite in hall c at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) from 2004 were used .",
    "up to now this evaluation of the @xmath0-dependence of polarizabilities stands as the present `` state of the art '' .",
    "however , in 2013 an updated version of the e94 - 110 measurement appeared  @xcite .",
    "this has motivated us to reexamine the generalized baldin sum rule .    at @xmath13",
    "the sum of electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon can be related to the unpolarized photo - absorption cross section @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the photon energy and @xmath17 is pion photo - production threshold .",
    "it is clear that at @xmath13 eq .",
    "( [ esr ] ) converges to eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) , since @xmath18 indeed , eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) is the original formulation of the baldin sum rule  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the baldin sum rule requires knowledge of the energy - dependence of @xmath19 up to @xmath20 .",
    "however , as the integral is weighted by @xmath21 , the contribution at low energies dominates the integral .",
    "the sum of the polarizabilites for the proton was evaluated by damashek and gilman  @xcite in 1970 , and amounts to @xmath22 a more recent calculation of eq .",
    "( [ abs ] ) was done by babusci _",

    "@xcite , with the result @xmath23 the current pdg  @xcite averaged experimental values for electric and magnetic polarizabilities for proton are    @xmath24    finally , a chiral perturbation theory calculation  @xcite predicts @xmath25 for the proton .",

    "the polarizabilities at @xmath13 provide a lower limit for the @xmath0-dependence of the generalized baldin sum rule .    here",
    "we calculate the generalized baldin sum rule , aiming to obtain the @xmath0-dependence of the sum of generalized electric and magnetic proton polarizabilities . as a corollary",
    ", we obtain a convenient parameterization of the @xmath1 structure function from recent experimental data which is valid in the low-@xmath0 , low @xmath11 kinematic region .",
    "the most recent results  @xcite for the @xmath1 structure function measured at jlab hall c were used for the contribution in the resonance region .",
    "furthermore , we adopted the results on the @xmath2 structure function in the resonance region obtained at jlab .",
    "for that we apply the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 given by the ratio of longitudinal to transverse cross sections .",
    "that procedure provides us reasonable confidence in constructing the parameterization of the structure functions .    at energies above the resonance region we adopt the regge approach .",
