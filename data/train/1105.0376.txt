    "the exclusive rare flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decay @xmath0 with @xmath10 has high sensitivity to physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) due to the large number of complementary measurements possible from the full angular distribution @xcite .",

    "the latter is characterised by the low recoil of the hadronic system . here , the large values of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the mass of the @xmath2-quark , allow to perform an operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite which , when combined with heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) and the corresponding heavy quark form factor relations @xcite , leads to powerful predictions , see @xcite and hurth and wyler in @xcite .",
