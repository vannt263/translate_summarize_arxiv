    "the non - resonant laser creates carriers in the barrier or in the wetting layer .",
    "the photo - created carriers then relax to the qd excited states via _ capture _ of the carriers from the barrier or the wetting layer to the confined qd excited states",
    ". then , _ intra - dot relaxation _ processes between the different qd discrete states lead to electron and hole population of the ground states from which the qd photoluminescence occurs .",
    "theoretical works show that the capture mechanism relies either on emission of optical phonons @xcite with typical capture times between and , or on electron - electron and electron - hole auger scattering @xcite with typical capture times between and .",
    "these calculations are in perfect agreement with time - resolved experiments performed in qds ensemble @xcite and in single qds @xcite where capture times of the order of have been measured . on the other hand ,",
    "irreversible auger scattering is mainly responsible for the intra - dot relaxation process , and theoretical calculations @xcite give estimate of the corresponding relaxation times in the - range .",
    "in fact , differential transmission measurements @xcite , pump - probe spectroscopy @xcite and time - resolved experiments @xcite showed that the auger - assisted processes involved in the intra - dot carriers relaxation occur within characteristic times between and . in total ,",
    "theoretical and experimental results show that the intra - dot relaxation times are generally much shorter ( from to ) than the characteristic times of the carriers capture from the continuum ( up to ) .",
    "the relaxation times to the qd ground states are thus often only attributed to the capture time .",
    "nevertheless , intra - dot relaxation processes , although secondary in the population relaxation , play a very important role in the coherence relaxation @xcite .",
    "the qd coherence is another fundamental aspect that has been widely studied . at low temperature ,",
    "the qd coherence is limited by spontaneous emission and qd coupling to its fluctuating environment .",
    "when spontaneous emission is the only dephasing process , the qd coherence is in the so - called radiative limit and in this ideal case , qds appear as ideal systems to transpose the atomic physics concepts to the solid state . in this context",
    ", major experimental results have been obtained in single qds , such as the emission of single @xcite and indistinguishable @xcite photons , the rabi oscillations @xcite and the strong coupling regime between a single qd and an optical microcavity @xcite .",
    "however , the radiative limit is hardly reached , showing that the intuitive artificial atom picture is strongly influenced by the qd environment .",
    "as previously shown by c. kammerer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , strictly resonant excitation of single qds is a crucial requirement in order to minimize the dephasing processes induced by the phonon and auger - assisted carriers capture .",
    "since the first direct measurement of the optical response of single qds under resonant excitation performed by a. muller _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , many results on resonant emission ( re ) in single qds were presented in the literature @xcite . however , except for studies in the re low power regime where the coherence is driven by the resonant excitation laser @xcite , the radiative limit is never reached even at very low temperature .",
    "this suggests that a fluctuating electrostatic environment which influences the qd coherence still exists , even in case of resonant excitation where the laser photo - creates carriers only in the qd .",
    "our recent work on the quenching of the qds re strongly corroborates this assumption @xcite .",
    "the resonant excitation of the neutral exciton in single qds can be completely inhibited by a coulomb blockade effect because of the presence of at least one residual charge in the qd . however ,",
    "this issue is overcome with the use of an additional weak non - resonant laser which neutralizes the qd and optically gates its re @xcite , as also shown in other recent experimental studies @xcite .",
    "the use of an additional weak non - resonant laser also appears to be interesting to probe the local environment fluctuations at the single - charge level in single qd @xcite and to minimize this environment fluctuations to improve the emitted photons indistinguishability @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of this optical gating effect in single qds under resonant excitation .",
    "the influence of the residual doping on the initial qd charge state , and consequently on the qd re quenching , is analyzed .",
    "moreover , a detailed population evolution model is developed to describe the carrier draining by the weak optical gate in the qd .",
    "this model which perfectly fits , with a single set of parameters , the experimental results in the steady state and dynamical regimes , shows that the carrier draining in the qd is governed by peculiar auger- and phonon - assisted capture processes .",
    "in fact , beyond the explanation of the optical gate effect , the original weak optical gate configuration allows us to study an unprecedented regime where the carriers capture involved in the qd draining is governed by ultra - slow processes with time constants of the order of 1 to .",
    "therefore , the optical gate appears to be a very sensitive probe of the residual doping of the sample and of the qd population in a regime of a very weak non - resonant excitation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ setup ] , we give some details on the sample and the experimental configuration .",
    "section  [ gate phenomenology ] is devoted to the resonant excitation results on a single qd , showing a striking quenching of the neutral exciton re which appears to be a general behavior .",
    "when such a situation is observed , the use of an additional non - resonant laser that acts as an optical gate allows a complete retrieval of the neutral exciton re . in parallel in appendix , we develop a self - consistent calculation of the influence of the residual doping on the qd charge state in the absence of optical excitation .",
    "the calculations show that the re quenching can be interpreted as a coulomb blockade effect where at least one residual charge in the qd blocks the resonant excitation of the neutral exciton .",
    "the optical gate phenomenology is then presented in an experimental study of the re intensity and energy shift as a function of the optical gate power .",
    "section  [ theory ] presents a population evolution model where the different carriers capture and escape processes induced by the optical gate are considered .",
    "section  [ theory vs experiment ] is finally devoted to a confrontation of our theoretical model to experimental data on the optically - gated re obtained either in the steady state or dynamical regimes .",
    "distinct experiments allow to obtain a highly constrained set of parameters used in our model . finally , as an illustration of the robustness of our approach",
    ", we reproduce quantitatively measurements of the emitted photon statistics .",
    "this statistics shows the usual antibunching at zero delay , but a strong photons bunching at larger delays .",
    "this bunching is essentially due to fluctuations of the qd between a neutral and a charged state .",
    "our sample is made of a single layer of self - assembled inas / gaas qds inserted in an alas / algaas planar microcavity .",
    "the qds density varies from @xmath0 to @xmath1  qds/ with an energy distribution of the emission from to with a maximum at . in the experiments , we focus on the low density region of the sample where the qds density is about @xmath2  qds/. the planar microcavity is a fabry - perot cavity made of two bragg mirrors which are composed of alternating alas and algaas layers of identical optical thicknesses @xmath3 ( @xmath4  ) .",
    "the cavity spacer is a @xmath5-gaas layer and the top and bottom bragg mirrors are respectively composed of 11 and 24 alas / algaas pairs , resulting in a quality factor of 2500 .",
    "the fabry - perot cavity mode is then centered at with a full width at half maximum of .",
    "the cavity asymmetry facilitates the extraction of the qd emission in the cavity mode in our conventional confocal micro - photoluminescence setup which is used in a reflection configuration for the sample characterization under non - resonant excitation .",
    "the microscope objective used in this setup has a numerical aperture na=0.35 leading to a spatial resolution of required for experimental studies on single qds .",
    "the resonant excitation of single qds is performed at by spatially decoupling the excitation from the detection paths in order to get rid of the elastic laser scattering @xcite .",
    "the excitation of the qds is done along the lateral facet of the sample by using a lensed fiber inserted in the cryostat while the detection is performed in the vertical direction with the confocal setup .",
    "the sample is fixed on a piezo - electric stage in order to optimize its position with respect to the lensed fiber .",
    "once coupled into the sample , the laser is confined in the microcavity and propagates .",
    "the planar microcavity thus acts as a two - dimensional waveguide for the excitation laser and the main contributions to the laser scattering arises from the edge of the sample or the defects in the bragg mirrors . since the results presented in this paper concern the re of a qd located far away from the edge of the sample , approximately at , the detection of the qd emission is not disturbed by the laser scattering on the edge of the sample .",
    "in fact , as we will see in the experimental results , the laser scattering is much weaker , even negligible , than the qd signal emission .",
    "the resonant excitation laser is a cw external cavity laser diode tunable from 1.25 to ( i.e. from 960 to ) with a spectral resolution of and with a spectral linewidth of ( i.e. ) .",
    "under non - resonant excitation in the gaas barrier ( with a he - ne laser ) , the photoluminescence spectra exhibit two distinct lines typically spaced by .",
    "figure  [ figure1](a ) shows a typical non - resonant photoluminescence spectrum for a excitation ( the excitation power is measured before the microscope objective ) .",
    "power - dependent studies and photon - correlation measurements @xcite were performed to identify the two lines as a neutral exciton @xmath6 , at the energy @xmath7  , and a charged exciton at the energy @xmath8  . moreover",
    ", the photoluminescence of the gaas barrier ( not shown here ) shows an emission line at resulting from the radiative recombination of the free electrons in the barrier with the holes bound to the carbon acceptors that are the unintentional impurities which appear during the sample growth @xcite .",
    "these impurities are notably responsible for the presence of residual holes in the sample .",
    "thus we consider that the charged exciton is a positive trion @xmath9 , which is further supported by the positive detuning of the charged exciton state with respect to the neutral one @xcite .",
    "the observation of the positive trion in the non - resonant photoluminescence spectra shows that the qds in the studied sample may efficiently capture residual holes that exist in the qds environment .",
    "nevertheless , under these excitation conditions , the simultaneous observation of the two lines indicates that the qd is either empty or populated by at least one hole .",

    "is observed at zero detuning whereas the corresponding experiment for the positive trion shows clearly a signal enhancement when the laser energy perfectly matches its energy ( fig .",
    "[ figure1](c ) ) .",
    "a statistical study showed that for more than 90% of the qds , the re signal arises only from the positive trion .",
    "this is due to the presence of at least one residual hole in the qds .",
    "these residual charges induce a photon absorption at the energy of charged excitonic complexes and not at the neutral exciton one for which the qd must be empty .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the coulomb blockade effect where the creation of a neutral exciton is blocked by the residual hole in the qd @xcite .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented by the use of a very weak additional non - resonant laser ( optical gate ) .",
    "starting from the experimental configuration used for the qds resonant spectroscopy ( see section  [ setup ] ) , an additional laser ( he - ne laser ) is injected perpendicularly to the sample surface via the confocal microscopy setup .",
    "this additional laser acts as an optical gate for the qd re @xcite . because of the very low gate power ( @xmath15   in fig .",
    "[ figure1](d , e ) ) , the non - resonant laser does not populate significantly the qd .",
    "power - dependent studies ( presented in section  [ re vs gate power ] , fig .  [ figure2](a ) ) show indeed that the photoluminescence induced by the hene laser can not be distinguished from the noise background for a typical excitation power smaller than .",

    "a strong re signal is now detected for the neutral exciton with an enhancement factor of about 30 .",
    "these data show that an ultra - weak non - resonant laser tends to neutralize the qd and then allows the resonant excitation of the neutral exciton .",

    "in fact , the energy shifts of @xmath6 and @xmath9 are governed , through the quantum confined stark effect , by the charge state of the qd environment , while the re intensity only depends on the charge state of the qd itself .",

    "in the following , we propose a simple theoretical model which describes the processes involved in the quenching of the neutral exciton re and the operation of the optical gate .",
    "as explained in appendix , the residual doping of the sample is at the origin of a hole reservoir which will notably influence the qd emission . as we do not have a precise knowledge of the qd electrostatic environment , we simplify the general description of the influence of the residual doping on the qd charge state by considering an effective model where the distribution of holes at the vicinity of the qd is schematized by a single trap such as an interface defect of the wetting layer ( see fig .  [ figure4 ] ) .",
    "residual holes introduced by the non - intentional doping of the sample will preferably be trapped ( de - trapped ) in ( from ) the defect , and the corresponding capture ( escape ) rate is denoted @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "each qd is supposed to be coupled to only one defect ( the phenomenology is the same in case of more defects ) .",
    "this defect is located in the vicinity of the qds and a tunneling channel between the defect state @xmath24 and the qd fundamental hole state @xmath25 opens if the defect is close enough to the qd ( the distance between the qd and the interface defect is discussed in section [ theory_shift ] ) .",
    "the hole tunneling rate from the defect to the qd is denoted @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for the inverse process rate . because the confinement of an interface defect is generally small",
    ", the @xmath24 state is close to the valence band continuum and we assume that @xmath28 .",
    "finally , due to the spin of the carriers , the defect state @xmath24 and the qd fundamental electron and heavy hole states , @xmath29 and @xmath25 , are twice degenerated and can then be populated by up to two carriers . from our experimental observations and from the calculation developed in appendix",
    ", this assumption seems reasonable since , without any light illumination , the @xmath25 state of the qd is populated in average by two holes at most .    within these hypothesis ,",
    "the evolutions of the average number of holes in the defect , @xmath30 , and the average number of holes ( electrons ) in the qd , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , are described by the rate equations :    @xmath33    considering @xmath28 , the populations in the steady state are then given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where two holes populate the @xmath25 state with the corresponding qd fundamental state @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the absorption of a photon at the energy of the neutral exciton , for which the ground state @xmath38 is @xmath39 , is impossible and an inhibition of the neutral exciton re is observed . a priori , such configuration neither allows the absorption of a photon at the energy of the positive trion , which is associated to the fundamental state @xmath40 , and the trion re",

    "therefore , even though the qd ground steady state is @xmath37 , the @xmath40 state is sometimes reachable when a hole escapes from the qd to the defect .",

    "we improve this model in order to obtain a quantitative description of the optical gate effect .",
    "the optical gate populates the gaas barrier as described in figure  [ figure5 ] in the absence of the resonant excitation laser .",
    "the evolution of the average number of holes in the defect , @xmath30 , in the qd , @xmath31 , and the average number of electrons in the qd , @xmath32 , is now described by the following rate equations :    [ evolution_general ] @xmath43    where @xmath44 stands for the electron capture in the qd and @xmath45 the hole capture rate in the qd , both from the barrier .",
    "the rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to the hole capture and escape for the defect , respectively .",
    "since we study qds in the strong confinement regime , the carriers trapped in the qd form electron - hole pairs in coulomb interaction characterized by a relatively small binding energy compared to the kinetic energy resulting from the geometric confinement .",
    "in this context and in case of a low gate power for which the qd is hardly populated by more than one electron - hole pair in the fundamental state , the radiative recombination of an electron - hole pair in the qd at the neutral exciton energy is proportional to @xmath48 when spin effects are not considered .",
    "the related radiative recombination rate @xmath49 corresponds to an excitonic radiative lifetime @xmath50  , which has been measured by time - resolved photoluminescence experiments in the same experimental configuration @xcite .",
    "( a ) sketch of the optical gate effect : carriers are created in the gaas barrier and captured by the qd or the defect .",
    "( b ) the capture and escape processes induced by the optical gate are schematized in a diagram showing the optical reservoir formed by the charges photo - created in the gaas barrier by the optical gate.,width=325 ]    in the explored power range , we assume the following hierarchy between the rates in the set of equations  ( [ evolution_general ] ) : @xmath51 this assumption will be justified in the following ( see section  [ on to off ] ) . within this hypothesis , the variations of the qd charge state is essentially governed by the two capture processes ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and its radiative recombination . concerning the defect charge state , it is governed by the two capture processes from the barrier and from the hole reservoir ( @xmath52 and @xmath22 ) , and the corresponding two escape processes ( @xmath53 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "consequently , in the absence of the resonant excitation laser , the evolution of the charge states of the qd and the defect becomes independent when the optical gate is switched on , and the set of equations  ( [ evolution_general ] ) is reduced to :    @xmath54      in fact , under resonant excitation , the equations ( [ trou ] ) and ( [ electron ] ) are not satisfied since they do not take into account the electron and hole populations that are created by the resonant excitation laser . in this context , the qd charge state drastically modifies the absorption of the resonant excitation laser .",
    "we stress that the model is developed for resonant excitation powers where the resonance fluorescence contribution in the re overwhelms the resonant rayleigh scattering @xcite .",
    "we thus focus on the populations and do not take into account any coherent effect .",
    "moreover , the model describes the linear regime before the saturation of the qd by the resonant laser , which corresponds to the actual experimental configuration .",
    "therefore , this model is only valid for intermediate powers of the resonant excitation laser , where stimulated emission processes are not considered , corresponding to its weak coupling regime with the qd ( i.e. , the strong coupling regime between the resonant laser and the qd , characterized by the so - called mollow triplet , is not considered ) . finally , this model is suitable for a non - resonant optical gate where the photo - created holes and electrons are not correlated .",

    "in such context , the de - trapping of charges from the defects is driven by auger effects , which are also very efficient for trapping holes in defects .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath53 is , as @xmath52 , preferentially associated to auger - assisted de - trapping processes , where one hole in the defect interacts with another hole in the barrier , than to the absorption of acoustic phonons .      in the previous sections ,",

    "the qd charge state fluctuations is the main reason for photon bunching @xcite and we observe a blinking between distinct excitonic states , namely the neutral exciton and the other excitonic complexes .",
    "note that a similar blinking behavior had already been observed in the differential transmission of a single qd under resonant excitation @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the electrostatic environment plays a crucial role on the optical response of a single qd even under resonant excitation where no charge is photo - created in its vicinity .",
    "a self - consistent calculation presented in appendix highlighted the influence of the unintentional residual carbon doping under no optical excitation which leads to the presence of at least one residual charge in the qd .",
    "as a result , more than 90% of the qds present a complete quenching of the neutral exciton re because of coulomb blockade effect . in this context , an additional weak non - resonant laser is used as an optical gate to control the qd charge state thanks to the capture of the photo - created charges in the gaas barrier , resulting in the carrier draining of the qd .",
    "the optical gate not only induces a complete retrieval of the neutral exciton re , but also allows an efficient control of the re in the original regime where the photoluminescence non - resonantly excited by the optical gate is completely negligible .",
    "we developed a population evolution model where the different capture and escape processes induced by the optical gate are considered to describe the dynamics of the qd charge state .",
    "this model perfectly fits , with only a single set of reasonable parameters , the various experimental results presented over seven orders of magnitude of the optical gate power , in the steady state and dynamical regimes .",
    "it appears that the qd ground state , and thus the re intensity , is governed by peculiar auger- and optical phonon - assisted capture processes characterized by long relaxation times of the order of 1 to .",
    "moreover , the measurements of the capture coefficients for both processes are in good agreement with theoretical calculations of various research groups .",
    "this study then constitutes a first confrontation between theory and experiment with such a low dynamic , concerning the carriers capture in qds .",
    "finally , the slow capture processes can be directly associated to an intermittent behavior of the qd re , which is similar to the blinking effect in qds and nanocrystals , and where the re quenching will be observed as long as the qd ground state is a charged state . in summary",
    ", we presented an experimental and theoretical study where the optical gate acts as a very sensitive probe of the residual doping and the qd population in an unprecedented explored regime of weak non - resonant excitation .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge p. m. petroff for providing the sample , and g. bastard , c. delalande and l. lanco for fruitful discussions and comments .",
    "the work was supported by the anr ( agence nationale",
    "de la recherche ) project extreme .",
    "according to the experiments , the sample has an unintentional residual carbon doping ( c - doping ) @xcite of volume density @xmath195 .",
    "the carbon binding energy @xmath196 is about , so that thermal activation can be neglected at the temperature of the experiments ( ) . as a consequence , in absence of the qds , the acceptors are neutral and the fermi energy is pinned at the energy @xmath197 above the top of the gaas valence band .",
    "a qd introduces bound states well above this energy , and thus some holes transfer towards the qds , leading to the formation of a depletion region around the qd plane ( see fig .  [ figureappendix](a ) ) . to estimate the density of transferred holes , we assume an idealized ensemble of identical qds ( of areal density @xmath198 around @xmath2  ) uniformly distributed in the qd plane ( taken at @xmath199 ) . neglecting both the qd height along the growth axis ( @xmath200 direction ) and the structuration due to the bragg mirrors , one obtains a volume charge distribution in the sample : @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the thickness of the depletion layer around the qd plane ( fig .",
    "[ figureappendix](b ) ) and @xmath203 the areal density of bound ( to the qds ) holes .",
    "we assume that acceptors are present only in a finite region around the qd plane , of total thickness @xmath204 ( for definiteness , we consider the thickness of the epitaxially grown cavity and take @xmath205   in the calculations ) .",
    "charge neutrality gives @xmath206 if only part of acceptors are ionized ( @xmath207 ) , or @xmath208 if all holes from doping are transferred into the qds ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "finally , the one - dimensional poisson equation imposes a red shift of the qd levels by : @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the gaas relative dielectric constant .",
    "( a ) top : sketch along the growth direction @xmath200 of the valence band of an empty qd surrounded by neutral acceptors from the unintentional residual carbon doping .",
    "bottom : sketch of the same qd after the acceptors ionization and the resulting holes transfer towards the qd .",
    "@xmath212 is the thickness of depletion region around the qd plane and @xmath213 the chemical potential fixed to the fermi energy of the neutral acceptors outside the depletion region .",
    "( b ) hole occupancy and depletion length @xmath212 as a function of the bulk doping density @xmath195 , for a qd density @xmath214  , at @xmath215  .,width=325 ]    we consider that the qds have cylindrical symmetry and , for the parameters in our sample , can bind up to 6 holes , distributed in the s and p shells ( respectively twice and fourfold degenerated , considering both orbital and spin degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the s and p single electron and hole states are initially variationally calculated for a qd of in - plane radius @xmath216   and height @xmath217   ( for which one calculates @xmath218  ) . the one - hole states are then used for the calculation of the coulombic - correlated ( and fully anti - symmetrized ) hole states of the multi - charged qd ( hosting @xmath219 holes ; for details see @xcite ) . finally , we evaluate the average hole occupancy per qd : @xmath220}{\\sum\\limits_{n}\\sum\\limits_{n(n)}\\exp\\left[\\beta\\left(n\\mu - e_{n(n)}\\right)\\right]}\\ ] ] where @xmath221 is the energy of the @xmath222 state of the qd with @xmath223 holes ( @xmath224 ) , @xmath225 and @xmath213 is the chemical potential .",
    "self - consistency of the hole occupancy is obtained by rigidly red - shifting the one - hole energies entering in the calculations of @xmath221 by @xmath226 ( eq .  ( [ energy_shift ] ) ) .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath213 is either imposed to be equal to the energy of holes bound to the acceptors outside the depletion region if the transfer is partial ( @xmath207 ) , or should be found is a self - consistent way when the transfer is maximum ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "figure  [ figureappendix](b ) shows the calculated hole occupancy ( left scale ) and depletion layer thickness ( right scale ) as a function of the bulk doping density @xmath195 ( at @xmath215  ) and for a qd density of @xmath227  .",
    "we clearly observe the consecutive filling of the various valence - band shells with increasing acceptor density .",
    "it is worth stressing that at low doping densities , all holes transfer to the qd plane and , because we focus on the low qd density region of the sample , the number of holes per qd is rather important : we obtain for instance that two holes dwell in the qds for @xmath228  . for larger c - doping densities ,",
    "the qd occupancy increases more slowly with increasing @xmath195 , while at the same time the depletion length rapidly decreases below it maximum value . for the typical acceptor densities of the order of @xmath229   @xcite ,",
    "the qd is nearly populated by three holes , which is more than the two holes occupancy considered in our work hypothesis ( see section  [ pop without gate ] ) . however , excepting an average value of the typical acceptor densities , we do not have a precise knowledge of the c - doping in the qd vicinity .",
    "note finally that notwithstanding for low qd and acceptor densities , the model described by eqs .",
    "( [ charge density ] ) to ( [ eta ] ) is very crude ( both dot - to - dot and inter - acceptor mean distances become very large ) , it nevertheless correctly describes the average occupancy @xmath230 in the full transfer regime ( i.e. , when @xmath231 ) , which could be anticipated from a more general standpoint ( i.e. , statistical distribution with charge neutrality consideration ) .",
