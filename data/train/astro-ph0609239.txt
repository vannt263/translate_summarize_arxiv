    "mass loss in the form of a wide - angle wind and/or collimated jet is a common feature observed in young , low mass stars that are still surrounded by accretion disks ( for a review see bally , reipurth , and davis 2006 ) .",
    "the material in these disks eventually accretes onto the central star , gets ejected in an outflow , or is incorporated into planets or other solar sytem - like bodies . understanding the processes",
    "through which young stars interact with and eventually disperse their disks is critical for understanding the rotational evolution of stars and the formation of planets .",
    "mass loss appears to be a necessary component in the accretion process both observationally as mentioned above and theoretically : angular momentum must be carried away in order to allow disk and stellar accretion to occur , and magnetized winds are efficient at removing angular momentum ( e.g. pudritz , pelletier , and gomez de castro 1991 , shu et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "signatures of mass loss are observed primarily in optical , infrared , and radio wavelength spectral diagnostics .",
    "bipolar outflows are observed in millimeter wavelength co lines and other molecular tracers in the mm and sub - mm range ( e.g. see review by arce et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the infrared , emission in h@xmath2 ( e.g. gueth & guilloteau 1999 ; stanke , mccaughrean , & zinnecker 2002 ) and [ ] ( e.g. reipurth et al .",
    "2000 ) lines are regularly seen in outflows from young stars . at optical wavelengths , herbig - haro ( hh ) objects and their associated stellar jets",
    "are routinely imaged in narrow band filters centered on h@xmath3 or on a host of forbidden lines .",
    "high resolution images of the central engine show that these jets originate from young stars surrounded by circumstellar disks , with the jet usually emerging perpendicular to the disk such as clearly seen in the case of hh 30 ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 , ray et al .",
    "spectroscopically , winds and jets are diagnosed by the appearance of p - cygni like line profiles in permitted lines such as h@xmath3 ( and other balmer lines ) and na d ( e.g. mundt 1984 ; reipurth .",
    "pedrosa , & lago 1996 ; alencar & basri 2000 ) , and in the profiles of forbidden lines which often show a strong asymmetry with substantial blue - shifted emission with little or no red - shifted emission ( e.g. edwards et al .",
    "1987 , hamann 1994 ) .",
    "more recently , jets and winds from cttss have been detected at shorter wavelengths corresponding to higher temperature emissions .",
    "hartigan et al . ( 1999 ) detect several ultraviolet ( uv ) emission lines in the hh 47a bow shock , and several irradiated jets with uv signatures have been discovered recently ( e.g. reipurth et al .",
    "1998 , bally & reipurth 2001 ) .",
    "gomez de castro and verdugo ( 2001 ) identify feature in the uv semiforbidden emission lines of ] @xmath4 and ] @xmath5 which they associate with shocks at the base of the jet in a few cttss . at x - ray energies ,",
    "a number of jets have also been recently detected ( e.g. pravdo et al .",
    "2001 ; favata et al . 2002",
    "; bally , feigelson , & reipurth 2003 ) . this x - ray emission forms in the fastest shocks associated with these stellar jets ( see also bally et al .",
    "2006 ) . while these high excitation emissions appear associated with shocks within the jets from young stars , until recently it was generally thought that the stellar or disk wind at the base of these jets was only heated to a level which could produce features such as the the p - cygni like profiles visible in the balmer lines .",
    "a hot wind component , possibly with an origin on the star as opposed to in the disk , has recently been proposed by a few authors .",
    "beristain , edwards , and kwan ( 2001 ) argue for a hot wind component in cttss based on the analysis of high resolution and line profiles observed in the optical .",
    "takami et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and edwards et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find obvious blue - shifted absorption below the local continuum in the @xmath610830 line in 6 young , low mass stars , again providing evidence for a hot wind component forming relatively near the star .",
    "edwards et al .",
    "( 2003 ) point out that the strength and ubiquity of this absorption indicates that the wind emanates over a large solid angle from the star : the @xmath610830 line does not trace a highly collimated flow .",
    "these results are reinforced by edwards et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who found subcontinuum @xmath610830 wind absorption in 26 of 38 cttss .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 lines of require a strong ionizing flux or a high temperature for excitation , as their upper states lie @xmath9 ev above the ground level .",
    "if these lines are primarily collisionally excited , temperatures of @xmath10 k are required to excite them ( athay 1965 ; avrett , vernazza , & linsky 1976 ) .",
    "with photoionization followed by recombination and cascade , helium excitation can take place at local kinetic temperatures between 8000 and 15,000 k ( zirin 1975 ; heasley , mihalas , & poland 1974 ; wahlstrom & carlsson 1994 ) .",
    "cttss in general ( e.g. feigelson et al . 2002 ) , and tw hya in particular ( kastner et al . 2002 ) , are strong x - ray sources , so the detection of these lines in ctts winds still leaves a wide range of possible temperatures present in these outflows .",
    "dupree et al .",
    "( 2005 ) detect @xmath8 absorption in the wind from tw hya and t tau .",
    "they combine these observations with an analysis of the line profiles of @xmath11 and @xmath12 observed with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) satellite to suggest that cttss possess continuous , smoothly accelerating winds which reach velocities of @xmath13 km s@xmath1  and temperatures of @xmath14 k. these results are based primarily on the _ fuse _ data for tw hya , since the data for t tau is much lower in quality .",
    "dupree et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find a minimum mass loss rate for the line of @xmath15 yr@xmath1 .",
    "such a hot temperature for the wind from tw hya is surprising , particularly given the high mass loss rate .",
    "alencar & batalha ( 2002 ) and herczeg et al . (",
    "2004 ) estimate a mass accretion rate onto tw hya of @xmath16  yr@xmath1 .",
    "most estimates suggest that the mass loss rate from cttss is 0.1  0.3 times that of the mass accretion rate ( knigl & pudritz 2000 , shu et al .",
    "1994 ) , suggesting the mass loss rate from tw hya may be as high as @xmath17  yr@xmath1 .",
    "such a high temperature , high mass loss rate wind puts strong constraints on the ultimate origin and heating of winds from cttss .",
    "current theories of mass loss from cttss primarily produce cold , magnetocentrifugally driven flows from the disks around these stars ( e.g. knigl & pudritz 2000 , shu et al .",
    "2000 ) which are then heated by a combination of ambipolar diffusion and x - rays to temperatures of @xmath18 k ( shang et al .",
    "2002 ; shang , li , & hirano 2006 ) .",
    "photoevaporation of the surface layer of the disk may also produce a low velocity ( @xmath19 km s@xmath1 ) wind with a characteristic temperature of @xmath20 k as well ( e.g. matsuyama , johnstone , & hartmann 2003 ; font et al .",
    "thus , if the dupree et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggestion holds true , a totally new heating , and possibly driving , mechanism must be identified . the analysis presented by dupree et al .",
    "( 2005 ) relies on the asymmetric _ shape _ of the line profiles tracing the hot gas : no true absorption against a local continuum is detected .",
    "therefore , we re - examine the published ( herczeg et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; dupree et al .",
    "2005 ) high resolution spectra from the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( _ stis _ ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) and from the _ fuse _ satellite to look for firm wind signatures and confirm the high proposed temperature in the wind of tw hya .",
    "the _ stis _ and _ fuse _ bandpasses cover several lines with characteristic formation temperatures ranging from @xmath18 k to @xmath14 k. we find firm evidence against the proposed wind in the and lines of tw hya .",
    "we therefore conclude that the wind in fact does not reach ( at least at large optical depth as claimed ) a temperature of @xmath21 k , characteristic of the formation of the line . in  2 we describe the observational data .",
    "section 3 presents our analysis , and  4 gives a discussion of our results .",
    "we observed tw hya with the e140 m echelle grating and the @xmath22 aperture on _",

    "we also observed tw hya with the lwrs ( @xmath25 ) aperture on _ fuse _ for a total of 32.8 ks in programs go - c067 and gto - p186 .",
    "the _ fuse _ consists of four co - aligned telescopes , each of which have two channels coated with lif and sic ( moos et al .",
    "each observation yields eight independent spectra covering @xmath26  .",
    "our co - added spectrum spans from 9051187   with @xmath27 .",
    "we reduced the _ fuse _ spectra using version 3.1.3 of the calfuse standard data reduction pipeline@xmath28 .",
    "pulse height values for each lif and sic spectrum were restricted to those detected in the individual extraction windows to reduce background noise .",
    "we use the standard calfuse wavelength solution ; however , the zero - point for this solution is not correct and must be fixed using the observed spectrum .",
    "we calibrated wavelengths at @xmath29 using 25 different h@xmath2 lines in this region , setting the wavelength zero point so that these lines appear at the radial velocity of the star ( herczeg et al .",
    "we calibrated the zero point of wavelengths at @xmath30   by cross - correlating the emission profiles for the 991.5   lines and several airglow lines , which appear in both the longer ( calibrated with the h@xmath2 lines ) and shorter - wavelength channels that overlap between 9851005  .",

    "dupree et al . ( 2005 ) assert the presence of a hot ( @xmath14 k ) wind from tw hya based on the _ shape _ of and emission line profiles .",
    "when considering the shape of emission lines , there can be an ambiguity between self - absorption in some part of the line profile and simply a lack of emission in this same part of the profile .",
    "the presence of a wind is much more firmly deduced when absorption is detected against a local continuum .",
    "contrary to the statements in dupree et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , a uv continuum is detected from tw hya , as is evident in many of the figures shown herczeg et al .",

    "all of the strong , unblended , relatively low temperature lines present in the _ stis _ spectrum of tw hya , including the 1335   lines , the 1305   triplet , and the doublets at 1260 and 1530  show evidence for wind absorption below the local continuum . in the upper panel of figure 1",
    ", we show that the wind absorption from the stronger , red members of the @xmath35 lines@xmath28 stays at zero flux out to a velocity of @xmath36 km s@xmath1  and the flux in the wind of the weaker blue member stays at zero flux out to a velocity of -165 km s@xmath1 .",

    "( 2005 ) diagnose the presence of a hot wind from tw hya by examining the shape of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 emission lines .",
    "these lines display an asymmetry in their profiles such that there is more emission on the red side of the profile than on the blue .",
    "this could represent self - absorption or scattering in a wind , or an accretion flow that preferentially produces red - shifted emission .",

    "the additional points address this concern .",

    "dupree et al .",
    "( 2005 ) interpret this as wind absorption in the line .",
    "the discussion in  3.1 above demonstrates that the h@xmath2 lines form inside the wind and will suffer absorption if a wind absorber overlaps a given h@xmath2 line in wavelength . as a result",

    "shown in red is the red component of the respective lines overlayed and scaled to match near the peaks and in the blue wings .",
    "the two components of the line have almost identical shape , which is somewhat expected since they trace almost exactly the same material .",
    "the red wing of the 1548.19   line extends to @xmath58 km s@xmath1  relative to the 1550.77   line , where any wind absorption due to the 1550.77   line should be quite strong .",
    "looking at the middle panel of figure 3 , the observed flux in the 1548.19   line is down by a factor or @xmath56 at this velocity .",
    "the red wing of the 1548.19   line shows no such evidence for absorption due to the `` wind '' traced by the 1550.77   line .",
    "this is not at all the case for , where we know there truly is a wind present . by overplotting the lines in the top panel of figure 3",

    "the different members of the multiplet trace essentially the same material . the red profile in the upper panel of figure 3 show that the emission in these lines should extend to @xmath59 km s@xmath1 ; however , the 1334.53   line only extends to @xmath60 km s@xmath1  due to the strong wind absorption due to the red members of the multiplet .",
    "if these lines ( absorption and emission components ) form in a wind , the far red wings are formed by material on the far side of the star .",
    "tw hya has a large inner hole in its disk ( e.g. johns  krull & valenti 2001 ) , so this material would be visible .",
    "if the emission component to the line forms in the magnetospheric accretion flow , it forms very near the star .",
    "regardless of whether the emission is produced by the accretion flow or the wind , the light would pass through the wind on the near side of tw hya and should suffer absorption at any wavelength where the projected velocities from the two lines overlap .",
    "the total lack of detectable absorption again leads us to conclude there is no significant amount of in the wind from tw hya .",
    "the emission line profiles are similar to the profiles , with strong redshifted emission extending to @xmath61 km s@xmath1  and much weaker blueshifted emission .",
    "the middle panel of figure 1 demonstrates that the continuum flux goes to zero in wind absorption due to the nearby @xmath61037 doublet and the ly@xmath39 @xmath62 line .",

    "would absorb most of the @xmath61037.0 line , but the red side of the line is strong , showing no indication of absorption . we therefore find an absence of any detectable in the wind .    whether the line shows wind absorption is ambiguous .",
    "the sensitivity of _ fuse _ at 977   is lower than at 1035  , so the continuum is not as well detected .",
    "the continuum level measured between -100 and -200 km s@xmath1  from line center is @xmath65 erg @xmath34 s@xmath1 @xmath1 , which is higher than the local continuum of @xmath66 erg @xmath34 s@xmath1 @xmath1 .",
    "no definite wind absorption is detected , but we also can not rule out some wind absorption that is either optically thin or narrower than that seen in other wind absorption lines .",

    "some emission is present at -270 km s@xmath1 , with a flux 10% that at the peak of the line profile .",
    "the flux in and lines drops to 10% the peak value at -150 km s@xmath1 , while lines show no emission shortward of -200 km s@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the emission at -270 km s@xmath1  is probably not emission .",
    "an h@xmath2 line at 976.2   may contribute as much as half of the flux at -280 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we are unable to identify the additional emission as either airglow or other atomic lines .",

    "based on the ionization equilibrium of c , this upper limit suggests a maximum wind temperature of @xmath69 k. the detection of optically thin wind absorption in the @xmath610830   requires either some photoionization or temperatures of @xmath70 k in the wind . in either case , some wind absorption is expected .",

    "wind absorption is also prevalent from the ctts ru lupi ( herczeg et al . 2005 ) , which has a much higher mass accretion rate than tw hya , and therefore presumably a higher wind mass loss rate .",

    "<S> it has recently been suggested that the winds from classical t tauri stars in general , and the wind from tw hya in particular , reaches temperatures of at least 300,000 k while maintaing a mass loss rate of @xmath0 yr@xmath1 or larger . </S>",
    "<S> if confirmed , this would place strong new requirements on wind launching and heating models . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore re - examine spectra from the space telescope imaging spectrograph aboard the hubble space telescope and spectra from the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer satellite in an effort to better constrain the maximum temperature in the wind of tw hya . </S>",
    "<S> we find clear evidence for a wind in the doublet at 1037   and in the multiplet at 1335  . </S>",
    "<S> we find no wind absorption in the 1550   doublet observed at the same time as the 1335   line or in observations of observed simultaneously with the 1037   line . </S>",
    "<S> the presence or absence of wind absorption is ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> the clear lack of a wind in the line argues that the wind from tw hya does not reach the 100,000 k characteristic formation temperature of this line . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore argue that the available evidence suggests that the wind from tw hya , and probably all classical t tauri stars , reaches a maximum temperature in the range of 10,000  30,000 k. </S>"
