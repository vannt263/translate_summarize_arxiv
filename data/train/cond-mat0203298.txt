    "@xmath0- na@xmath1v@xmath9o@xmath10 belongs to the family of av@xmath2o@xmath3 oxides ( a = li , na , ca , mg ) which have demonstrated , due to their peculiar crystal structures @xcite , a variety of low - dimensional phenomena .",
    "the nominally pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 is a mixed valence compound ( @xmath11 ) , with the structure consisting of vanadium - oxygen ( vo@xmath10 ) pyramids that are connected via common edges and corners to form layers in the ( * ab * ) plane .",
    "its structure can be described as an array of parallel ladders running along the * b*-axis , fig .",
    "each rung is made of a v - o - v bond , and contains one valence electron donated by the sodium atoms which are situated between layers .",
    "the sodium deficiency does not alter @xmath12 crystal structure @xcite up to x=0.70 , but changes the relative abundance of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 ions , e.g. introduces `` extra '' holes ( more @xmath14 ions ) in the ( * ab * ) planes .",
    "@xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 is one - dimensional antifferomagnetic ( af ) insulator at room temperature @xcite , despite the fact that the vanadium atoms have uniform valence of @xmath15 , which indicates the quarter - filled band structure , and suggests a metallic state .",
    "however , the optical measurements @xcite revealed the electronic gap of the order of 1 ev , which is formed between linear combinations of the @xmath16 states of the two vanadium ions forming the rungs @xcite .",
    "the insulating ground state is argued to originate from the strong electron - electron interaction @xcite e.g. due to the presence of a large on - site hubbard repulsion parameter u.    the effects of the hole doping on the optical properties of @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 have not been studied in details .",
    "this interesting topic certainly deserves attention because of the spectacular effects observed in doped af insulators , e.g. high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "reduction of the na concentration with respect to the nominally pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 has a strong influence on the room temperature raman spectra @xcite .",
    "the largest effect is the energy shift ( about 35 @xmath17 ) of the bond bending ( @xmath18 ) 448 @xmath17 phonon caused by the na - deficiency .",
    "such a strong renormalization of the phonon frequency is conjectured to arise from the delocalization of the electrons from the ladder legs to the bridge oxygens @xcite .    here",
    "we further examine the electron - phonon coupling effect in @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 by measuring raman spectra using different laser line energies .",
    "we also analyze the influence of the na - deficiency on the optical transitions in the mid - ir , and visible energy range .",
    "first , we show that the phonon energy renormalization is not as large as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , since the structure around 450 - 500 @xmath17 consists in fact of two modes .",
    "their intensity ratio changes due to the resonant conditions caused by the activation of the hole - doping associated electronic band , peaked at @xmath19 ev .",
    "second , we discuss the electronic structure of @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 on the basis of the infrared ( ir ) reflectivity and ellipsometric measurements .",
    "the present work was performed on single crystal plates of @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath9o@xmath10 ( 0.85@xmath20x@xmath201.00 ) with dimensions typically about @xmath21 mm@xmath22 in the * a * , * b * , and * c * axes , respectively .",
    "the details of the sample preparation were published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the ellipsometric measurements on the ( 001 ) surfaces of the crystals , both with the plane of incidence of the light along the * a * and the * b * axis . an angle of incidence @xmath23 of @xmath24 , was used in all experiments .",
    "procedure for extraction of the dielectric constants is described in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the infrared measurements were carried out with a bomem da-8 fir spectrometer .",
    "a dtgs pyroelectric detector was used to cover the wave number region from 100 to 700 @xmath17 ; a liquid nitrogen cooled hgcdte detector was used from 500 to 5000 @xmath17 .",
    "spectra were collected with 2 @xmath17 resolution , with 1000 interferometer scans added for each spectrum .",
    "raman spectra were measured in the backscattering configuration using micro - raman system with dilor triple monochromator including liquid nitrogen cooled ccd - detector .",
    "the ar and he - ne lasers were used as excitation sources .",
    "fig.2 shows the ( aa ) polarized raman spectra of @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 , measured at room temperature , for several laser line energies .",
    "the spectra are scaled along the vertical - axis for clarity .",
    "the spectra of nominally pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 , and the na - deficient spectra measured with 514.5 nm laser line show the characteristic features which were already observed , and discussed in previous reports @xcite . here , we focus on the 350 - 800 @xmath17 energy range , where three @xmath25 phonon modes at 418 @xmath17 , 448 @xmath17 and 532 @xmath17 , and a broad structure centered at 650 @xmath17 are found .",
    "two phonons at 448 @xmath17 and 532 @xmath17 are strongly interacting with underlying continuum , which is manifested through their asymmetric line shapes . in the na - deficient samples this effect seems to be strongly enhanced @xcite .",
    "the 448 @xmath17 mode corresponds to the @xmath18 bond bending vibrations , whereas the 532 @xmath17 mode corresponds dominantly to the bond stretching @xmath26 vibrations with a small contribution of the @xmath18 bond bending vibrations @xcite .",
    "the origin of the 650 @xmath17 structure is still under debate . its possible magnetic origin , due to the af coupling of the electrons along the ladder direction ( * b*-axis ) ,",
    "can be ruled out since the structure is observed only in the ( aa ) polarized configuration , and because its energy does not fit the estimates @xcite of the exchange coupling constant .",
    "the electronic band structure calculations @xcite show no evidence for the existence of low lying electronic states even though both raman and ir spectra confirmed their activity . the polaronic scenario , as discussed in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , is also questionable since the maximum of the electron density of states does not fall above the energy of the highest frequency phonon mode .",
    "nevertheless , raman spectra indicate the existence of the strong electron phonon coupling , that should be related to the charge transfer of the rung electron .",
    "the sodium deficiency introduces the holes in the rungs , so it is natural to conjecture that such charge dissonance is responsible for the bond bending phonon renormalization @xcite .    however , the na - deficiency has very little or no effect on the raman spectra measured with the 638.2 nm line , see fig.2 . the @xmath27 bond bending phonon at 448 @xmath17 does not exhibit large energy renormalization , and the 650 @xmath17 electronic continuum is clearly visible even in the sample with the @xmath28 hole concentration .",
    "this finding suggests that it is necessary to include the resonant effects into consideration .",
    "for example , in fig.2b we present the ( aa ) polarized room temperature raman spectra of @xmath0-na@xmath29v@xmath9o@xmath10 single crystal measured with several laser line energies .",
    "this graph shows a typical evolution of the raman spectra in @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 under strong resonant conditions .",
    "thus , we fit the raman spectra using fano model @xcite , which includes the effects of the interaction between discrete ( phonon ) and continuum ( electron ) states . for a particular energy range , 350 - 800 @xmath17 , we took five oscillators with 17 parameters .",
    "it is important to note , as it will be evident from our fits , that not all the parameters are crucial for the observed line shape change .",
    "the parameters of the first lorentz oscillator at 418 @xmath17 are kept constant , and used for the normalization of the spectra , since this mode does not show any change of intensity , energy , or half width under resonant conditions . for the phonons at 448 @xmath17 and 532 @xmath17 we adopt the fano line shapes of the form @xcite : @xmath30 , with q being the ratio of the raman tensors for discrete vibronic and continuum electronic scattering .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the real and the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy , when its interaction with a continuum is taken into account .",
    "the continuum is represented with a gaussian .",
    "the fifth oscillator appears at about 495 @xmath17 and its difference from the 448 @xmath17 mode is nicely seen in the raman spectra of @xmath0-na@xmath29v@xmath9o@xmath10 , measured with 488 nm laser line , see fig.2b .",
    "it is difficult to argue whether 495 @xmath17 mode interacts with the continuum or not , so we used lorentzian for this mode .",
    "the results of the fit are shown as solid lines in fig.2 .",
    "the fits are in all cases excellent .",
    "the values of the parameters for @xmath0-na@xmath29v@xmath9o@xmath10 are presented in the table i.    the major change in raman spectra under resonant conditions is described by only four parameters ; intensity ( i ) , and q , of the 448 @xmath17 mode , intensity of the 495 @xmath17 mode , and the @xmath35 of the gaussian .",
    "the values of the @xmath34 , and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the position of the mode maximum ) obtained from these fits are , within experimental error , the same for all spectra .",
    "since the @xmath34 is squared matrix element of the coupling between continuum and discrete state , this parameter should have no relationship with scattering wavelength @xcite .",
    "this is to be expected for the pure resonant effect , unless there is a change in the strength of the electron - phonon interaction , caused by the sodium deficiency .",
    "however , these parameters are also found to be the same for all samples with different na concentrations , which indicates that the electron - phonon interaction is not dependent on the hole concentration .",
    "the parameter q of the 448 @xmath17 mode has a strong dependence on scattering frequency , and its variation increases with increasing sodium deficiency .",
    "similar increase is also found for the intensity of the 495 @xmath17 mode .",
    "the square of the parameter q represents the ratio of the scattering probability for discrete state to that of the continuum , hence q can exhibit a dependence on the scattering frequency if the two processes have different frequency dependencies .",
    "this is confirmed by our fits .",
    "the new mode at about 495 @xmath17 is probably bond bending vibration of the rung without electron , since its energy is close to the corresponding bond bending vibration in v@xmath9o@xmath10 ( 482 @xmath17 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . under resonance",
    "the change of these parameters ( more precisely 1/q , and/or intensity ) can be related to the change of the optical conductivity or dielectric constant @xcite . in the nominally pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 , there is no electronic band in the visible energy region @xcite , and the raman spectra show no dramatic transformation induced by the measurements with different laser line energies .",
    "however , strong resonant scattering in the na - deficient samples should originate from the new electronic transitions at energies between 2 and 3 ev .",
    "this band , induced by hole doping is found at about 2.8 ev using ellipsometric measurements , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the optical conductivity of @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 , obtained from the ellipsometric measurements is given in fig.3 .",
    "for the nominally pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 the bands at the energies 0.9 , 1.2 , and 3.2 ev for @xmath38 , and at 1.2 , 1.6 , and 3.7 ev for @xmath39 are found in accordance with previous reports @xcite .",
    "the sodium deficiency causes the activation of the new optical transitions at about 2.8 ev in @xmath38 and at 3.2 ev in @xmath39 , see fig.3 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the 2.8 ev peak is responsible for the resonant behavior of the ( aa ) polarized raman spectra .",
    "the intensity of the 495 @xmath17 mode , see inset fig.3 , and the parameter @xmath40 of the 448 @xmath17 phonon , mimic the change in @xmath38 , which reinforces our conclusions about resonant effects in the raman spectra .",
    "the essential features of the @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 electronic structure are formed from oxygen 2@xmath41 and vanadium @xmath42 states .",
    "the fully occupied oxygen 2@xmath41 states are located about 3 ev below the lowest of the v@xmath42 states split by ligand field @xcite .",
    "the lowest state of the @xmath13 3@xmath43 manifold , 3@xmath44 state , is occupied by one electron .",
    "the v - o - v rung is formed through the electron hopping via oxygen @xmath45 states . due to this coupling ,",
    "usually denoted as @xmath46 , two 3@xmath44 orbital levels form symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of levels ( bonding and antibonding levels ) that are split by 2@xmath47 ev @xcite .",
    "the insulating state appears due to the large on - site hubbard repulsion , u , which pushes the fermi level in the middle of the gap between bonding and antibonding states @xcite .",
    "thus , the main peak in the optical spectrum along the * a * direction at 0.9 ev seems to originate from the transitions between bonding ( b ) and antibonding ( ab ) states of the same rung @xcite .",
    "the higher energy bands , above 3 ev , are similar to those found in @xmath48 @xcite , and correspond to the @xmath49 type of transitions .",
    "the sodium deficiency changes the relative abundance of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 ions .",
    "in fact , introduction of holes leeds to the formation of rungs without electrons , similar to the @xmath50 bonds in v@xmath9o@xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the optical transitions above 2 ev should also be similar in v@xmath9o@xmath10 and @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "however , previous studies @xcite did not clearly show what kind of the final state is involved in the 3.2 ev ( @xmath38 ) transition , and this turns out to be the most important information in order to understand the electronic structure of the na - deficient samples .",
    "if the final state is the bonding v@xmath16 state , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 should be in the metallic state , which is in strong disagreement with the observed insulating behavior . in the insulating state , the optical transitions between @xmath51 and the bonding v@xmath16 states should be forbidden .",
    "the next possibility is that the final state of 3.2 ev peak corresponds to the nonbonding v @xmath16 state , which forms when there are two electrons in the rung .",
    "according to the modified heitler - london model , proposed in order to account for the observed features in the optical conductivity spectra of @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite , the nonbonding band lies in the middle of the bonding - antibonding gap .",
    "the sodium deficiency is expected to drive the fermi level inside of the bonding bend , which now activates the transitions between the @xmath51 and bonding v@xmath16 states . in this case , the bonding level is partially filled , so this scenario also rely on the formation of the metallic state in @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 which is not observed .",
    "the ir reflectivity measurements show that the material remains insulating up to the maximal achieved hole concentration of about @xmath28 .",
    "the optical conductivity , obtained from the kramers - kronig ( kk ) analysis of the ir reflectivity , is presented in fig.4 . in both @xmath38 and @xmath39 spectra of @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3",
    "we found no drude behavior at low frequencies .",
    "instead , the dominant feature activated by the na - deficiency is observed in @xmath39 at about 0.44 ev , with a half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of about 0.25 ev .",
    "note that its energy corresponds to the half of the energy of 0.9 ev peak .",
    "clearly , all scenarios discussed so far are not yet adequate to fully describe the optical transitions and the electronic structure of the @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "we argue below that the electronic structure based on the four electronic bands can account for the major features observed in the optical conductivity of @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "simplified schematic representation of the optical transitions , and the energy levels in @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 , is shown in the inset of fig.3 . in the nominally pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 ,",
    "the arrows in the left side of the inset of fig.3 represent the optical transitions which we have already discussed .",
    "the energy levels of the sodium deficient samples are shown in the right side of the inset of fig.3 . in order to account for the appearance of the new modes at 2.8 ev and 0.44 ev in @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 spectra",
    ", we have to assume the existence of the impurity band ( ib ) , which forms inside the electronic gap of the pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "this band is further on considered to be empty , so the optical transitions , denoted as processes `` 3 '' in the fig.3 , may appear in the spectra .",
    "we find strong support for our assumption in the electronic structure , and the optical spectra @xcite of v@xmath9o@xmath10 . in this compound very narrow electronic band , which is separated from the rest of the conduction band by an additional gap , exists at the energy of about 2.5 ev .",
    "thus , it is possible that impurity band in sodium - deficient samples has its origin from this level .",
    "if so , the optical process `` 3 '' corresponds to the transition between oxygen 2p band and ib .",
    "its energy , @xmath52 ev , indicates that the ib forms almost exactly in the middle of the electronic gap of the pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "this is further supported by the existence of the mid - ir absorption peak at about @xmath53 ev , see fig.4 , which corresponds to the transitions between v @xmath44 and ib states .",
    "the nature of the ib determines the electronic properties of @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 . by increasing sodium deficiency",
    "the 0.44 ev peak grows in intensity and its width increases , which indicates that the ib gains dispersion . in order to preserve the preferential insulating ground state ( at least up to 15 @xmath54 deficiency ) this process",
    "is accompanied with the increase of the gap between vanadium @xmath42 bands .",
    "this is evident from the energy increase of the peak `` 1 '' in @xmath38 .",
    "because of that , and since this band is indeed very narrow ( 0.25 ev ) , ib does not overlap with the occupied d@xmath7 band , and the solution is an insulator since the fermi level is placed in the middle of the gap between bonding @xmath44 states and ib .",
    "the 0.44 ev peak is found to be much stronger in @xmath39 then in @xmath38 spectra .",
    "thus , we tentatively assigned it as the inter - rung electron transition along the * b * axis .",
    "in conclusion , we present the analysis of the optical properties of @xmath0-na@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 using ellipsometric , ir and raman scattering techniques . despite strong",
    "hole - doping the material remains insulating up to the doping concentration of about 15 @xmath54 .",
    "the insulating state appears as a consequence of very narrow impurity band formed in the middle of the electronic gap of the pure @xmath0-nav@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "the optical absorption peak develops at @xmath55 , ev and corresponds to the transitions between vanadium v @xmath44 and impurity band states .",
    "the change of the raman active multiple phonon structure upon doping , in the energy range between 450 and 550 @xmath17 , is the consequence of the resonance , and is caused by the activation of the hole - doping associated optical transitions peaked at about @xmath56 ev .",
