    "the strongest constraints on the ckm matrix likely to be achieved in the next three years will arise from the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "if @xmath5 is not too large , then it is hoped that @xmath5 will be measured to better than @xmath8 in run 2 of cdf @xcite . for the analysis of the ckm matrix",
    "the useful quantity is = ( ) ^2 k , where @xmath9 is a su(3 ) correction factor , calculated to be @xmath10 with a claim by lattice calculations of a @xmath11 error @xcite .    in terms of ckm parameters",

    "( [ sin2beta ] ) and ( [ xsxd ] ) have to do with @xmath2 mixing .",
    "thus , if there is a significant new physics contribution to @xmath2 mixing , then these measurements provide _ no constraint on ckm parameters_. rather , they would provide wrong values for the parameters , which we denote by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . naturally , _",

    "( [ sin2beta ] ) and ( [ xsxd ] ) .",
    "( [ sin2beta ] ) is also sensitive to new physics in @xmath1 mixing . considering only new physics of the form in eq .",
    "( [ superweak ] ) , the measurements of @xmath4 and @xmath5 really determine the @xmath19 matrix @xmath23 : m_12 & & 2 ( 1 - ) , [ eqa ] +    m_12 & & .",
    "[ eqc ] the ckm fit requires the positive value ; the negative value corresponds to the well known ambiguity @xmath24 @xcite .    the present limit on @xmath5 yields the result that @xmath25 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath5 will be measured to be between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , then @xmath18 will lie between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , corresponding to @xmath17 in the region between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been suggested on the basis of the measured @xmath32 decay rates that @xmath33 is greater than @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "if this were true , then it could be a sign of new physics .    as a possible way of finding a sign of this new physics",
    ", we consider the asymmetry in the time dependent decays @xmath35 . in fig .  1 the solid line shows the expected asymmetry for values of @xmath36 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath37 ( this corresponds to values for @xmath38 which lie between @xmath39 and @xmath40 )",
    ". the values of the asymmetry are well above zero .    in contrast , if the true @xmath41 , then the expected asymmetry is approximately @xmath42 .",
    "thus , a discovery of such a large negative asymmetry in this scenario could be a signal of new physics in @xmath2 mixing .",
    "note that the penguin contribution plays an important role in this analysis . in the absence of penguins",
    "the first asymmetry would be @xmath43 , which is already significantly larger than @xmath44 .",
    "however , inclusion of the penguin separates the asymmetries further by increasing the first asymmetry well above @xmath43 .",
    "this makes the difference even more striking .",
    "details of this calculation are given in the appendix .",
    "we have used a method proposed by silva and wolfenstein @xcite in which one invokes su(3 ) to relate the tree and penguin contributions in the @xmath3 decays to those in the @xmath45 decays .",
    "the details of this calculation depend on su(3 ) , factorization and were originally performed assuming that the strong phase shift between the penguin and the tree contributions in the @xmath3 and in the @xmath45 channels is equal to a common value @xmath46 and , moreover , that @xmath47 .",
    "recently , this analysis has been revisited by fleischer @xcite , allowing @xmath46 to take any value .",
    "since we are interested in a large qualitative effect , small changes in the assumptions made in the calculation will not affect the conclusion .",
    "for example , setting @xmath48 yields the dash - dotted curve in fig .  1 .",
    "there is , however , one critical assumption : the sign of the penguin term relative to that of the tree .",
    "if we choose the negative sign , or equivalently let @xmath49 , we obtain the dashed curve in fig .  1 . assuming this sign , the asymmetry for @xmath50 is about @xmath51 .",
    "thus , except for low values of @xmath18 ( large values of @xmath5 ) , the large qualitative difference disappears . as discussed by fleischer @xcite , allowing for any value of @xmath46 , the measured asymmetry allows a limited range of values for @xmath33 .",
    "this leads us to consider the following three possibilities :    * if a sizeable positive asymmetry is found , this would be consistent with values of @xmath17 well below @xmath34 , as postulated in our scenario , and rule out values greater than @xmath34 . * a very large negative asymmetry would be consistent with a true value of @xmath33 in the neighborhood of @xmath52 , as has been proposed @xcite , and could rule out values of @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath53 . in this case",
    "we could have a signal of new physics independent of any assumption about @xmath46 . * a negative asymmetry in the neighborhood of @xmath54",
    "could be interpreted in different ways : ( 1 ) if one believes from factorization that @xmath55 is close to @xmath56 , then one obtains @xmath33 slightly above @xmath34 and this could be a sign of new physics in our scenario ; ( 2 ) the true value of @xmath33 is really @xmath17 for values of @xmath18 above @xmath57 but @xmath55 is close to @xmath58 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , if @xmath55 is close to @xmath58 , then the motivation for a value @xmath59 given in ref .",
    "@xcite may disappear . as a particular example , let us take @xmath60 and @xmath61 , corresponding to @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . if the true values were @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , then , in order to fit the @xmath19 mixing from eqs .",
    "( [ eqa])([eqc ] ) , with the positive sign in eq .",
    "( [ eqc ] ) , we would need & = & - + & = & - , where the subscript @xmath69 denotes a superweak - like contribution , as in eq .",
    "( [ superweak ] ) , and the subscript @xmath70 denotes the standard model contribution .",
    "another possible interpretation of the large negative asymmetry in this scenario would be that the true value of @xmath71 is given by the minus sign in eq .",
    "( [ eqc ] ) . in that case",
    ", the phase @xmath72 would be about @xmath73 instead of @xmath31 .",
    "then the true value of @xmath33 would have to be around @xmath74 in order to explain the large negative asymmetry .",
    "therefore , the main new contribution would be ( m_12)_sw ~- 2 ( m_12)_ckm .",
    "in the standard model the best determination of the ckm matrix elements , from @xmath4 and @xmath5 , depends on the absence of new physics effects in the mixing .",
    "therefore , it is possible that experiments that are really sensitive to the phases of decay amplitudes may show qualitative deviations from expectations based on @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "one example is discussed in this paper , where we have stressed the usefulness of a _ qualitative _ measurement of the cp - violating asymmetry in @xmath3 decays .",
    "this work is supported in part by the department of energy under contracts de - ac03 - 76sf00515 and de - fg02 - 91-er-40682 .",
    "the work of j.  p.  s.  is supported in part by fulbright , instituto cames , and by the portuguese fct , under grant praxis xxi / bpd/20129/99 and contract cern / s / fis/1214/98 .",
    "l.  w.  thanks slac for support during the time this work was carried out .",
    "for completeness , we include in this section a description of the method proposed by silva and wolfenstein @xcite to estimate the asymmetry in the time dependent decays @xmath35 . in this method one",
    "uses two observables as input : @xmath75 obtained from the cp - violating asymmetry in @xmath0 decays ; and r , [ definition - of - r - sw ] recently measured by cleo to be @xmath76 @xcite , where we have added the errors in quadrature .",
    "in addition , one uses the spectator approximation and su(3 ) ( in fact a u - spin rotation interchanging the @xmath77 and @xmath78 quarks ) to relate the tree dominated process @xmath3 to the penguin dominated @xmath45 . here",
    "we will follow the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the relevant decay amplitudes may be written as a(b_d ^+ ^- ) & = & t + p e^i = e^i t , [ bpipi - amp ] + a(b_d k^+ ^- ) & = & t^+ p^e^i ^ = e^i t^. [ bkpi - amp ] here @xmath46 and @xmath79 are strong phases , while @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the ratios of the magnitudes of the penguin to the tree contributions in each channel , respectively .",
    "therefore @xcite , r = .",
    "using u - spin we may relate the two decay channels through ^ & = & , + & = & | | , + & = & | | .",
    "[ pprime / p ] in the last two expressions we have used factorization to estimate the ratio of matrix elements in the two channels .",
    "this provides a first order estimate of the su(3 ) breaking effects .",
    "therefore , defining a = , we obtain r = ( ) ^2 .",
    "[ masterr ] here , we have used the true values of @xmath82 and @xmath33 ( @xmath83 ) as they appear in the ckm matrix .",
    "( [ masterr ] ) determines @xmath84 .",
    "finally , the time dependent asymmetry in @xmath35 decays is given by = [ masterasym ] where _ f = = - e^-2 i(+ ) .",
    "[ masterlambdaf ] notice that we have used @xmath85 ( as opposed to the true ckm phase @xmath82 ) because any new physics appearing in the mixing will affect the interference cp - violating asymmetries in both the @xmath3 and @xmath0 channels , through the same @xmath86 . in the presence of new physics @xmath82 in eqs .",
    "( [ bpipi - amp ] ) and ( [ bkpi - amp ] ) need not be the same as @xmath16 .",
    "1 was obtained in the following way .",
    "we have set @xmath87 .",

    "we have taken @xmath90 , which is in the lower side of the range allowed by cleo @xcite , in order to facilitate comparison with ref .",
    "next , we consider the scenario in which the true value of @xmath33 is really @xmath52 . the corresponding value of @xmath82 is obtained by requiring @xmath91 , thus continuing to satisfy the @xmath12 measurement . for each case",
