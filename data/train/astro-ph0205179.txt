    "here it is shown that the slow ip variations seen in one of the components of 0437 ( vivekanand et al .",
    "@xcite ) are correlated with variations of the spiky emission in that component ( vivekanand @xcite ) .",

    "to bottom the five panels correspond to ( 1 ) 9 files observed from ut 15:27:59 to ut 15:42:08 on 7 mar 1995 , ( 2 ) 2 files observed at ut 15:43:57 and ut 15:45:49 on 7 mar 1995 , ( 3 ) 12 files observed from ut 16:04:17 to ut 16:23:22 on 7 mar 1995 , ( 4 ) 13 files observed from ut 15:39:25 to ut 16:04:21 on 9 mar 1995 , and ( 5 ) 3 files observed at ut 15:51:21 , ut 15:53:02 and ut 15:54:40 on 14 mar 1995 .",

    "on 7 mar 1995 , the peak flux of the third component of the ip of 0437 decreased from 3.3 to 2.6 over a period of @xmath1 36 minutes ( panels 1 to 3 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . during this time",
    "the peak flux of its central component increased from 5.2 to 5.6 , and that of its first component increased marginally from 2.1 to 2.3 .",
    "these correspond to fractional flux variations of 21.2% , 7.7% and 9.5% respectively , which are much larger than the @xmath1 1% to 2% maximum allowed by purely random noise .",
    "two days later 0437 had an ip similar to that observed earlier ( panel 4 ) .",
    "five days later its first component became stronger than its third component ( panel 5 ) , exactly contrary to its behavior a week earlier ( panel 1 ) .",
    "vivekanand et al .",
    "@xcite argued that these profile variations are intrinsic to 0437 , and are not an artifact due to the single polarization observations of ort coupled with faraday rotation in the variable ionosphere . in the next section it will be shown that the ip variations of component 3 are highly correlated with the occurrence of the spiky emission in that component .",
    "on account of limited signal - to - noise ratio of the data ( vivekanand @xcite ) , only the 500 strongest spikes in each data file were analyzed ; ideally one would have liked to completely separate the spiky from the non - spiky emission for this exercise .",
    "first , the 500 strongest spikes in each data file were identified and their positions ( phases ) were obtained as described in vivekanand @xcite .",
    "next , these positions were plotted against the numbers of the periods in which they occurred , for those spikes which satisfied following two selection criterion : ( 1 ) their peak signal to noise ratio should be greater than 12.5 , and ( 2 ) the error on their position should be less than 20 micro seconds ( @xmath2s )",
    ". however the final result is not very sensitive to these two selection criterion .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] plots the positions of 375 of the 500 strongest spikes in the data file labelled 50661527 , as a function of the period number .",
    "this belongs to the profile category labelled b by vivekanand et al .",
    "@xcite ; the rms errors on the positions are less than the width of the dots .",
    "there are 52 , 314 and 9 spikes in the three main components of the ip , respectively .",
    "if the two selection criterion are dropped , one obtains 66 , 421 and 13 spikes in the corresponding components of the ip , which are entirely consistent with earlier numbers . in file",
    "labelled 50661538 belonging to the same category , that was observed at ut 15:38:41 on 7 mar 1995 , 0437 was at one of its lowest average fluxes .",
    "the number of spikes in the three main components of the ip , with and without the selection criterion , are 39 , 301 and 1 , and 56 , 442 and 2 , respectively , which are again fractionally similar .",
    "therefore the two selection criterion do not significantly alter the results of this article .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] plots the positions of the 500 strongest spikes in the data file labelled 50661612 , which belongs to the category labelled a by vivekanand et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the number of spikes in the three main components of the ip are 46 , 453 and 1 , respectively ; no spikes have been selected out due to the high average pulsar flux in this data file .",
    "clearly the fraction of spikes in the third component of the ip has decreased significantly compared to category b. this is verified in a visual check of as many periods as is reasonably possible . even in file",
    "labelled 50661538 , several periods had spikes in the third component of the ip , that were not part of the 500 strongest spikes .    to test this more rigorously ,",
    "the above numbers were totalled for all files in each category of the ip ; the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "the 9 files of panel 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] yielded totally n0 = 3598 spikes ; the rest of the 4500 spikes were ignored due to the two criterion mentioned above .",
    "out of these , n1 = 408 spikes occurred in the first component of the ip , n2 = 3155 spikes occurred in the second component , and the n3 = 35 spikes occurred in the third component .",
    "this was for the type b profile .",
    "n0 is 12405 for the 25 files of type a profile ( panels 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . from this one",
    "would have expected n1 = 408 / 3598 @xmath3 12405 @xmath1 1407 @xmath4 38 , whereas one obtained the smaller number 1255 .",
    "similarly one expected n2 = 3155 / 3598 @xmath3 12405 @xmath1 10878 @xmath4 104 in the second component , but obtained the larger number 11144 .",
    "but the most interesting number is the expected n3 = 35 / 3598 @xmath3 12405 @xmath1 121 @xmath4 11 , which is significantly larger than the observed value of 6 ; and this occurs in spite of the average pulsar flux increasing by about 14% ( table 1 ) .",
    "clearly the decrease in rate of occurrence of spikes in the third component of the ip of 0437 is correlated with the decrease in average flux of that component .",
    "this trend continues in the last row of table 1 ( panel 5 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) ; but caution is required here .",
    "since one selects the 500 strongest spikes in each data file , the results should not depend upon the average flux of 0437 to the zeroth order .",
    "but for very low average flux of 0437 one expects to see no spike in the third component of the ip , since the probability of occurrence there is very low anyway ( vivekanand @xcite ) .",

    "the last column contains the average flux ( in arbitrary units ) of 0437 in those panels , along with its rms error . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the expected values of n1 , n2 and n3 in the last panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , based on the type b profile , are 39 @xmath4 6 , 302 @xmath4 17 and 3 @xmath4 2 ; these are consistent with the observed values .",
    "one would have liked to see a larger value for n1 here , to be consistent with the increased flux of the first component of the ip ; but one is probably dealing with small numbers due to limited data , as well as a significantly weaker pulsar flux in those files .",
    "table 1 has also been derived after removing the two selection criterion , and the results remain similar .",
    "the n3 values in the 9 files of row 1 of table 1 range from 9 to 1 .",
    "the first three files observed chronologically , labelled 50661527 , 50661529 and 50661531 , have n3 = 9 , 5 and 7 , respectively .",
    "now 0437 was strong in these files and weakened systematically with time .",
    "not surprisingly , n3 vales in the next six files are 3 , 2 , 4 , 1 , 2 and 2 ; these files are labelled 50661533 through 50661542 .",
    "it is clear that there was no hope of seeing any spikes in the third component of the ip in the next two files , viz .",
    "50661543 and 50661545 in panel 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , even if they existed , due to the low average flux of 2.54 @xmath4 0.04 in these two data files ; which is why the single pulse mode of observation was discontinued after that time .",
    "however , after about 18 minutes , the average flux of 0437 became high again ; which is why the single pulse mode of observation was re - started once again . but n3 for the next 12 data files , belonging to panel 3 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , was a mere 5 ; only five data files had n3 = 1 , and the rest had n3 = 0 . more convincingly , n3 was a mere 1 for the 13 data files belonging to panel 4 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; and these contain some of the highest average flux data on 0437 .    it is therefore concluded that the decrease in n3 between the first two rows of table 1 is a feature intrinsic to 0437 .",
    "that this decrease correlates with the decrease in the flux of the third component of the ip proves the basic hypothesis of this article .",
    "the clinching evidence would have been if one had actually seen the decrease in the number of spikes as time progresses ( in figures similar to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , in the two data files labelled 50661543 and 50661545 of panel 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which are believed to be in transition between categories b and a. unfortunately , this is not possible due to the low average flux of 0437 in these two data files .",
    "vivekanand et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the ip of the milli second pulsar 0437 changes significantly in shape over time scales of minutes and hours and even days .",
    "this is unlike the much faster mode changing known in normal pulsars .",
    "they argued that this behavior was intrinsic to 0437 , and not an instrumental effect .",
    "here it is shown that profile variations in the third component of the ip of 0437 are correlated with the rate of occurrence of the spiky emission in that component .",
    "each period that contained any of the 35 + 6 = 41 spikes , in the third component of the ip in table 1 , was visually checked for confirmation .      1 .   the first concerns the availability of only a single polarization at ort .",
    "navarro et al .",
    "@xcite show that the percentage of linear polarization of 0437 at 438 mhz is highest at the peaks of components 2 and 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( also their fig .",
    "1 ) ; component 1 has very low linear polarization . from their fig .  1",
    "the position angle of linear polarization differs by less than @xmath5 at these two peaks .",
    "therefore , it is possible that , in principle , differential faraday rotation in a variable ionosphere at ort can reduce the effective flux density of spikes in component 3 by @xmath6 41% or less , in spite of the arguments of vivekanand et al .",
    ". this issue can be resolved satisfactorily only when full polarization observations of 0437 are available at 326.5 mhz .",
    "however , one would have expected an as frequent reduction of number of spikes in component 2 also , with respect to the number of spikes in component 3 ; this is not observed , although the statistical basis of such a conclusion is not strong .",
    "furthermore , it is quite possible that the mean position of spikes , in components 2 and 3 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is not coincident exactly with the corresponding position of the peak of linear polarization .",
    "in such an eventuality , the effect discussed above would be less serious , since the linear polarization profiles in components 2 and 3 are fairly sharply peaked .",
    "finally , similar profile variations have been noted by bell et al .",
    "@xcite in 0437 at 430 mhz in * full polarization * observations .",
    "this author feels they might have wrongly attributed the observed profile variations to `` relative gain variation in the two polarization channels and the high degree of polarization of the emission observed across the profile '' .",
    "vivekanand @xcite has shown that the position of occurrence of spikes is uncorrelated with their height ; no simple relation exists between these positions and the integrated profile ( figures 5 and 6 of that paper ) .",
    "therefore this author can not think of any obvious selection effect involving these parameters that can produce the result of this paper .",
    "one would have liked to find a quantitative correlation between the rate of occurrence of spikes ( table 1 ) and the average flux in the other two components of the ip ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) also .",
    "unfortunately this is complicated by two factors .",
    "firstly , the average pulsar flux in a data file could be so low that the observed rate of occurrence of spikes in any component may be biased to a lower value .",
    "secondly , the average flux of the spiky emission can also change in principle , from file to file and from component to component . to illustrate the problem , the fraction of n3 spikes in table 1 decreases down the rows , consistent with decrease in flux of the third component of the ip in fig .",
    "however , the fraction of n1 spikes in table 1 also decreases , although marginally ; this is inconsistent with the increase in flux of the first component of the ip ; this can easily arise due to the reasons mentioned above , as also due to a small change in the occurrence rate of spikes in the second component of the ip , which has about 90% of the spikes anyway .",
    "0437 has also been studied at @xmath1 1400 mhz by several workers , but this kind of behavior has not been reported so far .",
    "one possible reason is the low signal to noise ratio of their data .",
    "the other possible reason could be that 0437 does not show such behavior at other frequencies .",
    "there is a precedence for this ",
    "psr b1821 - 24 shows radio profile instability at 1400 mhz but not at 800 mhz ( backer & sallmen @xcite ) .",
    "it is likely that the ip variations of the first component of 0437 , as well as any other component , are also due to the rate of spiky emission in that component , although that has not been proved rigorously here .",
    "it is further speculated here that the exact shape of the three principal components of the ip of 0437 is a * consequence * of the spiky emission , and not its * cause*. this is supported by fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where about 16% of the periods containing the 2000 strongest spikes in the entire data have an ip that has intense peaks in the three components ; small variations in the spiky emission in any one of these three components is quite likely to change the shape of the overall ip of 0437 .",
    "this further enhances the doubt , expressed in the last section of vivekanand @xcite , about the interpretation of the individual components of the ip of 0437 as * individual beams or regions of emission*. it is worth exploring the suggestion in that paper regarding the independent method of resolving the ip into independent beams or regions of emission on the pulsar ."
