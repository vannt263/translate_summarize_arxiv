    "intuitively , a set is a collection of elements ( e.g. , numbers or symbols ) that is completely determined by them . the elements of a set are pairwise different .",
    "if we relax this restriction and allow repeated occurrences of any element , then we end up with a mathematical structure that is known as _ multiset _ ( see  @xcite for a historical account of the development of the multiset theory ; also , see  @xcite for a recent account of the mathematical theory of multisets ) .",
    "multisets are really useful structures and they have found numerous applications in mathematics and computer science .",
    "for example , the prime factorization of an integer @xmath1 is a multiset @xmath2 whose elements are primes .",
    "also , every monic polynomial @xmath3 over the complex numbers corresponds in a natural way to the multiset @xmath4 of its roots .",
    "in addition , multisets have been used in concurrency theory  @xcite .",
    "a rather interesting recent development in the theory of multisets is the discovery that the logic of multisets is the @xmath5-fragment of intuitionistic linear logic ( see  @xcite for details ) .    if we allow elements of a multiset to occur an integral number of times ( and that includes a _ negative _ number of times ) , we end up with a structure that has been dubbed _",
    "hybrid set_. these structures have been introduced by loeb  @xcite .",
    "initially , one may wonder whether hybrid sets are of any use .",
    "however , loeb has shown that they are indeed very useful structures ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , one can use a hybrid set to describe the roots and the poles of a rational function .",
    "in particular , if @xmath3 is a monic rational function , then @xmath3 can be written in terms of its roots @xmath6 , and its poles @xmath7 , as follows : @xmath8 from this we can directly form a hybrid set , where elements that occur a positive number of times correspond to the roots of the function and elements that occur a negative number of times corresponds to the poles of the function .    in a seminal paper , yager  @xcite introduced fuzzy multisets , that is fuzzy subsets where an element may occur more than one time ( see  @xcite for an up - to - date presentation of the theory of fuzzy multisets , which , however , does not differ significantly from  @xcite ) .",
    "yager defined fuzzy multisets as follows  @xcite :    assume @xmath9 is a set of elements .",
    "then a fuzzy bag @xmath10 drawn from @xmath9 can be characterized by a function @xmath11 such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the set of all crisp bags drawn from the unit interval .    in `` modern parlance ''",
    "fuzzy multisets can be characterized by a high - order function . in particular , a fuzzy multiset @xmath10 can be characterized by a function @xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 is the set of natural numbers including zero .",
    "it is not difficult to see that any fuzzy multiset @xmath10 is actually characterized by a function @xmath17 which is obtained from the former function by _ uncurrying _ it .",
    "however , it is more natural to demand that for each element @xmath18 there is only one membership degree and one multiplicity . in other words ,",
    "a `` fuzzy multiset '' @xmath10 should be characterized by a function @xmath19 . to distinguish these structures from fuzzy multisets",
    ", we will call them _ multi - fuzzy _ sets  @xcite . given a multi - fuzzy set , @xmath10 ,",
    "the expression @xmath20 denotes that there are @xmath21 copies of @xmath18 that belong to @xmath10 with degree that is equal to @xmath22 .",
    "apart from their applicability to mathematics , multisets are really useful structures as interesting models of computations are built upon them .",
    "for instance , the chemical abstract machine of berry and boudol  @xcite is an abstract machine that is well - suited to model concurrent computation and manipulates _ solutions _ , which are finite multisets of _ molecules _ where a molecule is simply a term of an algebra .",
    "membrane computing is a model of computation that is built around the notion of multiset rewriting rules .",
    "more specifically , membrane computing is a computational paradigm that was inspired by the way cells live and function ( see  @xcite for an overview of the field of membrane computing ) . roughly speaking",
    ", a cell consists of a membrane that separates the cell from its environment .",
    "in addition , this membrane consists of compartments surrounded by porous membranes , which , in turn , may contain other compartments , and so on . at any moment , matter flows from one compartment to any neighboring one .",
    "in addition , the cell interacts with its environment in various ways ( e.g. , by dumping matter to its environment ) .",
    "obviously , at any moment a number of processes occur in parallel ( e.g. , matter moves into a compartment , while energy is consumed in another compartment , etc . ) .",
    "a p  system is a conceptual computational device whose functionality is based on an abstraction of the cell .",
    "thus , a p  system consists of porous membranes that are populated with multisets of objects , which are usually materialized as strings of symbols .",
    "in addition , there are rules that are used to change the configuration of the system .",
    "a p  system behaves more or less like a parser , which is clearly hard - wired to a particular grammar .",
    "thus , a p  system stops when no rule can be applied to the system .",
    "the result of the computation is always equal to the cardinality of the multiset that is contained in a designated compartment .",
    "now , since rigid mathematical models employed in life sciences are not completely adequate for the interpretation of biological information , there have been various proposals to use fuzzy sets in the modeling of biological systems ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is quite reasonable to attempt the use of the theory of fuzzy sets in p  systems .",
    "indeed , such an attempt has been described in  @xcite that is generalized to a certain degree in this paper .",
    "[ [ structure - of - the - paper ] ] structure of the paper + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in what follows , i will define @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets and @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid sets .",
    "next , i will define the basic operations between such structures ( e.g. , union , sum , etc . ) .",
    "also , i will give the definition of certain standard fuzzy - theoretic operators . by replacing multisets with either @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets or @xmath0-hybrid sets in the definition of both p  systems and the chemical abstract machine",
    ", we end up with fuzzy versions of these notational computing devices .",
    "we formally define these devices and briefly investigate their properties .",
    "the paper ends with the customary concluding remarks .",
    "one may say that multisets form an abstraction of the _ token - type _ distinction , which is the basis of the `` token - token identity theory ''  @xcite , while ( ordinary ) sets are an abstraction of the denial of the token - type distinction . to make clear the essence of the token - type distinction",
    ", i will borrow an example from  @xcite .",
    "if one writes the word `` dog '' three times ( i.e. , `` dog dog dog '' ) , then she has written three instances , or tokens , of the one type of word .",
    "this observation necessitates a distinction between types ( i.e , abstract general entities ) and tokens ( i.e. , concrete particular objects and events ) .",
    "`` a token of a type is a particular concrete exemplification of that abstract general type '' .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is no question that three instances of the word `` dog '' are tokens of the `` dog '' type .",
    "however , there are many instances where one can not make such a definitive statement regarding the type of some tokens .",
    "in particular , there are many cases where some token @xmath23 is of type @xmath24 to a certain degree . for example , consider the following glyphs :        each of them depicts an `` a , '' however , each one is reminiscent of the `` standard a '' to some degree .",
    "for instance , the rightmost is less reminiscent of the `` standard a '' , while the leftmost glyph looks like an ordinary `` a. '' a text is clearly a multiset of letters , but if we are free to use any of these `` as '' to typeset a document , then we need a fuzzy multiset to _ describe _ the text .",
    "however , this is not a common practice and so we need a more restricted structure that better models real life situations .",
    "as was noted above these structures will be called multi - fuzzy sets .    clearly , it is too restrictive to demand that tokens are of some type to a degree , which is expressed by some number that belongs to the unit interval .",
    "more generally , we can assume that the likelihood degree is drawn from some frame @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it is possible to define many other partially ordered sets that are frames .",
    "for example , vickers  @xcite shows that finite observations on bit streams have the properties of a frame .",
    "thus , the similarity degree would express the idea that an element resembles , in some way , an element of such a frame .",
    "typically , a frame is defined as follows  @xcite :    a poset @xmath10 is a _ frame _ iff    1 .",
    "every subset has a join 2 .",
    "every finite subset has a meet 3 .",
    "binary meets distribute over joins : @xmath25    * @xmath0 is a nonempty set ; * @xmath26 and @xmath27 are binary operations on @xmath0 ; * both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are * * idempotent ( i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) ; * * commutative ( i.e.,@xmath30 and @xmath31 ) ; * * associative ( i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) ; * * distributive ( i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) ; * * and they satisfy the absorption law ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) .",
    "note that a frame is clearly a distributive lattice .",
    "so , @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets are an extension of multi - fuzzy sets just like @xmath0-fuzzy sets  @xcite are an extension of fuzzy sets .",
    "kostrikin in his comments in the entry for the conecpt of duality in the _ encyclopaedia of mathematics _ notes that `` [ d]uality is a very pervasive and important concept in ( modern ) mathematics . ''",
    "one could argue that hybrid sets , and , therefore , fuzzy hybrid sets , extend multisets and their fuzzy counterparts to describe and/or to model dualities .",
    "let us now proceed with the formal definition of @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid sets :    [ fuzzy : hybrid : set ] an @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid set @xmath37 is a mathematical structure that is characterized by a function @xmath38 , where @xmath0 is a frame , and it is associated with a @xmath0-fuzzy set @xmath39 . more specifically , the equality @xmath40 means that @xmath37 contains exactly @xmath21 copies of @xmath18 , where @xmath41 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath42 with @xmath16 in the previous definition , then the resulting structures will be called _ @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets_.    assuming that @xmath37 is an @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid set , then one can define the following two functions : the _ multiplicity _ function @xmath43 and the _ membership _ function @xmath44 . clearly , if @xmath40 , then @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "notice that it is equally easy to define the corresponding functions for an @xmath0-multi - fuzzy set .",
    "i believe this is a good point to briefly express my prejudices and my intentions regarding the present work . clearly , it is not my intention to develop an axiomatic set theory of @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid sets and @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets , in the sense of the zermelo - frnkel set theory , but rather a `` nave '' set theory in the sense that i will not present a precise axiomatization .",
    "therefore , i plan to introduce only the basic set - theoretic operations and the basic properties of these sets . to begin with ,",
    "let me now define the cardinality of an @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid set :    assume that @xmath37 is an @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid set that draws elements from a universe @xmath9 .",
    "then its cardinality is defined as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a binary multiplication operator that is used to compute the product of @xmath49 times @xmath50 .    if @xmath51 ( i.e , when extenting `` intuitionistic '' fuzzy sets , see  @xcite ) , then @xmath52 .    when @xmath0 is the unit interval , then @xmath53 is the usual multiplication operator .",
    "the cardinality of a set is equal to the number of elements the set contains .",
    "clearly , the previous definition is not in spirit with this assumption .",
    "however , hybrid sets may contain elements that occur a negative number of times .",
    "thus , one may think that we should take this fact under consideration when computing the cardinality of a hybrid set and , more generally , the cardinality of an @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid set .",
    "so , it makes sense to introduce the notion of a _",
    "strong _ cardinality defined as follows :    assume that @xmath37 is an @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid set that draws elements from a universe @xmath9",
    ". then its _ _ s__trong cardinality is defined as follows : @xmath54 .    for reasons of completeness",
    "i give below the definition of the cardinality of @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets :    assume that @xmath37 is an @xmath0-multi - fuzzy set that draws elements from a universe @xmath9 .",
    "then its cardinality is defined as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath55 is some binary operator that maps @xmath49 and @xmath56 to some positive real number ( since @xmath57 ) .    in order to complete the presentation of the basic properties of fuzzy hybrid sets ,",
    "it is necessary to define the notion of subsethood .",
    "before , going on with this definition , i will introduce the ( new ) partial order @xmath58 over @xmath42 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath59 , then @xmath60 note that here @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the classical logical conjunction and disjunction operators , respectively .",
    "in addition , the symbols @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the well - known ordering operators , and @xmath63 is the absolute value of @xmath21",

    "also , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "but what kind of structure is the pair @xmath68 ?",
    "the answer is easy with the help of the following result :    the relation @xmath58 is a partial order .",
    "i have to prove that the relation @xmath58 is reflexive , antisymmetric and transitive :    reflexivity : :    assume that @xmath69 .",
    "then if @xmath70 ,    @xmath71 from the first part of the disjunction .",

    "antisymmetry : :    assume that @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and    @xmath76 .",
    "then if @xmath70 this implies that    @xmath77 and so @xmath78 . if @xmath72 , then    it follows that @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and    @xmath81 , which implies that @xmath78 .",

    "also , since both @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets and @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid sets are actually generalizations of fuzzy sets , one should be able to define the @xmath104-cuts of such sets .",
    "i will start by defining the basic set operations between @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets .",
    "let me first present the definitions of union and intersection of @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets :    assuming that @xmath105 are two @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets , then their union , denoted @xmath106 , is defined as follows : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the join of @xmath109 .",

    "as such they have a number of properties ( e.g. , they are idempotent , etc . , see  @xcite for details ) that , naturally , affect the properties of the operations defined so far .",
    "indeed , these operations have the following properties :    for any three @xmath0-multi - fuzzy sets @xmath117 the following equalities hold :    1 .",

    "<S> an orthogonal approach to the fuzzification of both multisets and hybrid sets is presented . in particular , we introduce @xmath0-multi - fuzzy and @xmath0-fuzzy hybrid sets , which are general enough and in spirit with the basic concepts of fuzzy set theory . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we study the properties of these structures . </S>",
    "<S> also , the usefulness of these structures is examined in the framework of mechanical multiset processing . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we introduce a variant of fuzzy p  systems and , since simple fuzzy membrane systems have been introduced elsewhere , we simply extend previously stated results and ideas . </S>"
