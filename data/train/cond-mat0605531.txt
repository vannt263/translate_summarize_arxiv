    "reduced - density - matrix - functional theory ( rdmft ) is one possible way to tackle the problem of electronic correlation .",
    "it is based on gilbert s theorem  @xcite , which is an extension of the hohenberg - kohn theorem to non - local external potentials .",
    "gilbert s theorem guarantees that the ground - state expectation value of any observable of a quantum mechanical system is a unique functional of the ground - state one - body reduced - density matrix ( 1-rdm ) .",
    "thus , the fundamental quantity in rdmft is the 1-rdm instead of the electronic density on which dft is built upon .",
    "the properties of the exact 1-rdm have been the subject of theoretical studies for a long time  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , only relatively recently approximate total - energy functionals of the 1-rdm were used in practical applications  @xcite .",
    "all these approximate functionals give a satisfactory account of electronic correlations in small atoms and molecules at the equilibrium distance .",
    "the latest generation of functionals performs equally well at the molecular dissociation limit .",
    "especially this latest success makes rdmft particularly appealing .",
    "a great advantage of rdmft , compared to dft , is that the exact many - body kinetic energy is easily expressed in terms of the 1-rdm .",
    "more specifically , the total energy of a many - electron system in its ground state , characterized by an external potential @xmath0 , can be expressed in terms of the ground - state 1-rdm , @xmath1 as @xmath2 = e_{\\rm ion } + \\int d^3{{\\bf r}}\\int   d^3{{\\bf r'}}\\ : \\delta({{\\bf r}}- { { \\bf r ' } } ) \\left [ -\\frac{1}{2 } \\nabla_{\\!\\!{{\\bf r}}}^2 \\right ] \\gamma({{\\bf r } } , { { \\bf r ' } } ) \\\\ + \\int d^3{{\\bf r}}\\int",

    "the next three terms are , respectively , the kinetic , the external potential and the electrostatic energy and they are known , explicit functionals of @xmath1 . finally , the last term is the exchange and correlation ( xc ) energy which contains all the remaining electronic contributions to the total energy .",
    "the exact form of this functional is unknown and for practical applications needs to be approximated .",
    "most of the approximate functionals for the xc energy that have been introduced so far are implicit functionals of @xmath1 .",
    "they depend explicitly on the natural orbitals @xmath3 , and the corresponding occupation numbers @xmath4 which are defined as the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the 1-rdm : @xmath5    viewed as a functional of arbitrary @xmath1 in an appropriately defined domain , the functional given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_of_g ] ) has a minimum value at the ground - state @xmath1 .",
    "this appropriate domain is defined through subsidiary conditions for @xmath1 known as @xmath6-representability conditions .",
    "it was shown by coleman  @xcite that there are two such conditions for @xmath1 , and they concern the occupation numbers @xmath7 where @xmath6 is the total number of electrons .",
    "these conditions guarantee that @xmath1 corresponds to either a pure many - body state or an ensemble of pure states .",
    "the first condition can be enforced in the minimization with respect to @xmath1 through the lagrange - multipliers method . in that way",
    ", the quantity to be minimized becomes @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the corresponding lagrange multiplier .",
    "@xmath9 was shown to be equal to the chemical potential , i.e. the derivative of the total energy with respect to the total number of electrons  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this allows one to exploit the discontinuity of @xmath9 as a function of the particle number for the calculation of the fundamental gap of materials and is a motivation for the development of rdmft schemes for periodic systems in order to address questions like the semiconductor and insulator gaps .",
    "the second of the @xmath6-representability conditions  ( [ eq : conditions ] ) has a dramatic consequence : it allows for border minima in the occupation number optimization .",
    "in other words , it allows for the the existence of a subset of the optimal occupation numbers which are exactly equal to either one or zero and do not satisfy the condition @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to the corresponding states as pinned states .",
    "it is rather unlikely for the exact theory to produce pinned states for most systems of interest . for an occupation number being exactly equal to one , the corresponding natural orbital would be present in all determinants of the full ci expansion with non - zero coefficients . a situation like that has not been found for small atoms and molecules or for the heg , where the exact solution can be calculated .",
    "while this is true for the exact xc functional , all the approximate functionals which are considered in this work , yield pinned states with @xmath11 for all systems we applied them to , except for the two - electron systems .",
    "these pinned states are core states and , in the exact theory , they correspond to occupation numbers which are marginally smaller than one .",
    "hence , as far as the optimal @xmath1 is concerned , the approximate result , @xmath11 , is perfectly satisfactory .",
    "the important implication , however , is that @xmath12 for the pinned states , and consequently @xmath13 at the optimal @xmath1 .    a number of approximate functionals for @xmath14 , including those of interest in the present work , can be cast into the form    @xmath15 = e_{\\rm xc } \\left [ \\ { n_j \\ } , \\ { \\varphi_j \\ } \\right]= -\\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{j , l=1}^{\\infty }   \\int d^3{{\\bf r}}\\int   d^3{{\\bf r'}}\\ : f(n_j , n_l ) \\ : \\frac{\\varphi_j^*({{\\bf r}})\\ : \\varphi_l^*({{\\bf r'}})\\ : \\varphi_l({{\\bf r}})\\ : \\varphi_j({{\\bf r'}})}{|{{\\bf r}}-{{\\bf r'}}| } \\,,\\ ] ]",
    "i.e. they have the form of the usual hartree - fock exchange modified by the function @xmath16 of the occupation numbers .",
    "the first such approximation was introduced by mller  @xcite and corresponds to the function @xmath17 .",
    "mller considered a more general exponent for the occupation number product in the exchange - like term and found an optimal exponent of 1/2 . by modelling the exchange and correlation hole ,",
    "buijse and baerends  @xcite arrived at the same functional .",
    "goedecker and umrigar  @xcite ( gu ) considered a modification by explicitly removing the self - interaction ( si ) terms .",
    "they also presented  @xcite a direct minimization with respect to the natural orbitals and the occupation numbers and found correlation energies for small atomic systems which are in very good agreement with the exact results .",
    "later however , it was realized that the gu functional fails to reproduce the correct dissociation limit for small molecules  @xcite . on the other hand , the mller functional yields the correct dissociation limit but , in all cases , overestimates substantially the correlation energy  @xcite .",
    "in the last decade , several other functionals of the 1-rdm have been introduced  @xcite and applied to atomic and molecular systems .",
    "recently , gritsenko et al .",
    "@xcite proposed improved 1-rdm functionals based on a hierarchy of repulsive corrections to the mller functional .",
    "in that way , they attempted to correct the overcorrelation of this functional .",
    "the functionals corresponding to these hierarchical corrections , are called bbc1 , bbc2 , and bbc3 . for all these functionals , it is essential to divide the natural orbitals into strongly and weakly occupied ones .",
    "this distinction appears naturally for finite systems since usually a subset of the orbitals corresponds to occupation numbers close to one , and the rest to occupation numbers close to zero . for the bbc1 and bbc2 functionals ,",
    "the function @xmath16 is :    @xmath18    @xmath19    finally , in the bbc3 functional the anti - bonding orbital is treated as strongly occupied orbital .",
    "additionally , the self - interaction terms are removed as in the gu functional , except for the bonding and anti - bonding orbitals .",
    "gritsenko et al .",
    "@xcite applied the bbc functionals to diatomic molecules and showed that they give an accurate description of these molecules at both the equilibrium distance and the dissociation limit .",
    "there is a strong motivation for the extension and application of 1-rdm functionals to solid - state systems .",
    "this motivation stems from the success of these functionals in the description of electron correlation for finite systems , as well as the difficulties of dft methods in describing certain materials and properties such as the band gap of semiconductors and insulators  @xcite or the band width of the conduction band in na  @xcite .    a very important prototype system , which serves as a benchmark for the performance of approximate 1-rdm functionals when applied to periodic systems , is the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) .",
    "furthermore , this system can serve as a laboratory for the development of approximate functionals , in a fashion similar to dft . as a consequence of translational invariance",
    ", the natural orbitals can be chosen as plane waves and the search for the ground state 1-rdm is restricted to the optimization of the momentum distribution @xmath20 , which is the occupation number that corresponds to the plane - wave natural orbital with wavevector @xmath21 . an important point to note",
    "is that the self - interaction terms for the plane - wave natural orbitals vanish .",
    "consequently , the gu and the mller functionals are identical .",
    "finally , approximations that involve a special treatment of single orbitals have zero effect in the continuous wavevector case .",
    "thus , the bbc3 functional is identical to bbc2 .    as a consequence of the rotational invariance of the heg",
    "the occupation numbers have the property @xmath22 , i.e. all the plane - wave natural orbitals corresponding to the same absolute value @xmath23 are degenerate ( with respect to the occupation number ) .",
    "this allows one to perform unitary transformations among the degenerate plane waves leading , e.g. , to angular - momentum eigenfunctions @xmath24 for the natural orbitals , where @xmath25 are spherical bessel functions and @xmath26 spherical harmonics .",
    "since these functions are localized in real space it is conceivable to include self - interaction corrections in terms of the natural orbitals ( [ eq : sphwaves ] ) for the heg . to our knowledge , this possibility has not been explored so far and is also beyond the aim of the present work .    choosing the natural orbitals as plane waves , the 1-rdm of the heg can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the volume of the system ( @xmath29 ) . substituting this expression in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e_of_g ] ) and  ( [ eq : exc ] ) we obtain for the total energy    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 are wavevector indices , and @xmath33 is a small quantity ( usually @xmath34 ) included for numerical stability . as in hartree - fock , the external potential energy and the electronic coulomb repulsion energy , i.e. the third and fourth terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_of_g ] ) cancel exactly with the first term i.e. the ion - ion interaction . the quantity @xmath35 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) per particle then becomes @xmath36   f(n(k_1 ) , n(k_2 ) ) + \\mu \\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is the fermi - wavevector of the non - interacting heg and @xmath38 is the radius ( in atomic units ) of the sphere with volume equal to the volume per electron .",
    "cioslowski and pernal  @xcite applied the mller functional to the heg and calculated analytically the resulting momentum distribution @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electron - density - per - spin , @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding total energy per particle is independent of the density and equal to @xmath42 hartree .",
    "it is obvious that the solution of the eq .",
    "( [ eq : kios_per ] ) is consistent with the second @xmath6-representability constraint of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conditions ] ) only for @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 .",
    "in other words , the mller functional gives a solution without pinned states only for @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , cioslowski and pernal demonstrated that the oxford - lieb  @xcite bound is violated for @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 . the solution with pinned states for @xmath47 , was calculated by csnyi and arias  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath47 , one gets an optimal momentum distribution @xmath48 with @xmath49 for @xmath23 below a certain value @xmath50 and fractional @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "this behavior is in complete analogy to the case of finite systems for the mller functional .",
    "unfortunately , it is in conflict with the fact that the exact momentum distribution  @xcite is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath23 and is strictly smaller than 1 , i.e. there are no pinned states .",
    "additionally , the exact momentum distribution is concave for @xmath53 , it shows a discontinuity at @xmath54 , and for @xmath55 it goes to zero asymptotically .",
    "the size of the discontinuity is decreasing with @xmath38 .",
    "in addition to the mller functional , csnyi and arias  @xcite considered a similar functional derived from a tensor product expansion of the two - body density matrix , which they called corrected hartree - fock ( chf ) . unfortunately , chf gives zero correlation for the heg in the high - density limit ( @xmath56 ) , coinciding with hartree - fock . in the opposite limit",
    ", it strongly overcorrelates giving the same results as the mller functional . in the intermediate region , including the metallic densities , the result for the correlation energy is close to the exact but its dependence on @xmath38 is monotonically decreasing instead of increasing . in an attempt to improve over the mller functional and chf , csnyi , goedecker and arias considered an improved tensor product expansion of the two - particle density matrix  @xcite .",
    "the resulting functional , which is called cga , performs very well in the high - density regime and significantly better than the previous two functionals in the region of metallic densities .",
    "the deviation from the exact correlation energy increases with @xmath38 and at higher densities cga coincides with chf and the mller functional .    in the present work ,",
    "we apply the bbc1 and bbc2 functionals of gritsenko et al .",
    "@xcite to the heg and compare with previous functionals as far as the resulting correlation energies are concerned .",
    "we also investigate other features like the resemblance of the resulting momentum distribution to the exact and the state - pinning . in order to apply the bbc1,2 functionals to the case of the heg through eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) , we need to distinguish between strongly and weakly occupied orbitals . for finite systems ,",
    "gritsenko et al .",
    "@xcite chose the first @xmath57 natural orbitals to be strongly occupied .",
    "in complete analogy , we can use a critical wavevector @xmath58 below which all states are assumed to be strongly occupied while above they are weakly occupied .",
    "an additional goal of the present work is to demonstrate that the heg can be used to develop functionals suitable for metallic systems .",
    "the idea is to modify the bbc1 functional in such a way that it yields the exact correlation energy for the heg .",
    "this is achieved in two different ways : ( i ) for each given density we choose @xmath59 such that bbc1 reproduces the exact correlation energy of the heg at that density .",
    "we call this functional @xmath59-functional .",
    "( ii ) we introduce a function @xmath60 multiplying the xc terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : exc ] ) for two weakly occupied orbitals , keeping @xmath58 . in this way",
    ", we replace the sign change of the bbc1 functional with the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "accordingly , we call this functional @xmath61-functional .    in the following section we present details of the numerical implementation as well as the results of applying the bbcs and the @xmath59- and @xmath61-functional to the heg .",
    "the minimization of the energy expression  ( [ eq : energy ] ) with respect to @xmath48 is performed using the steepest - descent method .",
    "we choose to work in energy - space instead of @xmath23-space , i.e. we perform the variable substitution @xmath62 and solve numerically the minimization problem for @xmath63 . working in energy - space rather than",
    "@xmath23-space improves the stability of the numerical treatment .",
    "the energy @xmath64 is discretized using a double - logarithmic mesh centered at @xmath65 , where the occupation varies the most .",
    "the upper limit of integration is chosen such that the momentum - distribution function has dropped to values smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "the double integration with respect to the energy is carried out using an adaptive grid technique capable of treating integrable singularities like the logarithmic singularity of the present problem .",
    "the values of the energy - distribution function @xmath63 in between the mesh points , necessary for the adaptive grid method , are obtained from an interpolation scheme .",
    "the @xmath6-representability constraint @xmath67 is implemented through the substitution @xmath68 $ ] and variation with respect to @xmath69 .",
    "extra care is required to avoid @xmath63 being falsely pinned to 0 or 1 .",
    "indeed , if for a particular @xmath64 , @xmath63 gets very close to 1 or 0 during the variation it would stay pinned at that point . the variation with respect to the lagrange - multiplier @xmath9",
    "is implemented as an external iterative procedure , thus achieving convergence for each value of @xmath9 . the correct value of @xmath9 is selected by requiring the momentum - distribution function to integrate to the correct number of electrons for a given value of @xmath38 .",
    "finally , we found that a reasonable value for the parameter @xmath33 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : etotheg ] ) and ( [ eq : energy ] ) is @xmath70 , which avoids both numerical problems as well as the dependence of the results on @xmath33 .",

    "[ fig : correl ] , we show the correlation energy of the heg as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "the correlation energy calculated with the bbc1 and bbc2 functionals is significantly closer to the exact than any other functional over the whole range of @xmath38 .",
    "both functionals also seem to reproduce the correct asymptotic limit of zero correlation for the dilute heg . for small densities up to metallic densities , the bbc functionals under - correlate , i.e. the absolute value of the correlation energy is too small . in the dense limit ,",
    "they over - correlate and the crossover is at around @xmath38=0.5 and 0.3 for the bbc1 and bbc2 , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , in the area of low metallic densities both functionals yield correlation energies which deviate from the exact values by 50% . in absolute numbers ,",
    "the error of bbc1 and bbc2 is of the same order as the rpa result  @xcite . nevertheless , in the range @xmath72",
    ", the bbc functionals perform remarkably well . compared to all previous 1-rdm functionals ,",
    "bbc1 and bbc2 offer a much better account of the electron correlation for the heg .",
    "although less accurate than the cga in the high density region , they perform better for metallic densities and they reproduce the limit of zero correlation at the dilute heg limit where the mller functional , chf and cga fail .",
    "a feature of the exact momentum distribution , namely the discontinuity at the fermi wavevector @xmath54 , is reproduced by the bbc functionals .",
    "the discontinuity is more pronounced for the bbc1 functional , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : momdistr ] , where we plotted the momentum distribution of the heg with @xmath73 and @xmath74 using the mller functional as well as bbc1 and bbc2 .",
    "contrary to bbc1 and bbc2 the mller functional does not yield a discontinuity . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no report of any other 1-rdm functional reproducing this feature of the heg . to extract the size of the discontinuity quantitatively , we used two energy mesh points very close to @xmath75 ( at a distance of @xmath76 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta1 ] , we plot the size of the discontinuity @xmath77 as a function of @xmath38 .",

    "the discontinuity is substantially smaller than for bbc1 and it goes to zero at @xmath78 . both the size and the dependence on @xmath38 are in complete disagreement with the exact theory , where @xmath77 is substantially bigger and decreases with @xmath38 as one can see from the two fits to the dmc data  @xcite .

    "we show that the bbc functionals  @xcite yield a significant improvement over previous functionals as far as the correlation energy is concerned .",
    "in addition , they yield a discontinuity of the momentum distribution at the fermi wavevector in resemblance of the exact heg theory .",
    "however , the size and the dependence on the density of this discontinuity are not in agreement with the quantum monte carlo results .    by introducing an appropriately fitted function of @xmath38 in the bbc1 functional ,",
    "we demonstrate that the exact correlation energy of the heg can be reproduced with a smooth and monotonic fitting function . for this function ,",
