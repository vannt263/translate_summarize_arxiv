    "random systems can be broadly classified by the effect disorder has at large length scales . in many cases",
    ", the quenched randomness tends to be averaged out on long distances .",
    "disorder then plays only a minor role in determining the universal behavior , and could be understood at a perturbative level .",
    "the more interesting alternative is that the disorder remains finite as the system is coarse grained .",
    "finally , at the opposite extreme are systems in which the disorder grows without bound upon coarse graining .",
    "such systems are said to be governed by infinite - randomness fixed points .",
    "the strong disorder renormalization group ( sdrg ) method , which is the focus of this review , provides a way to exploit the strong randomness in order to systematically compute universal aspects of the physics .",
    "the technique was originally developed by dasgupta and ma@xcite to investigate the ground state and low energy behavior of the random heisenberg spin chain .",
    "later , the sdrg scheme was extended by bhatt and lee @xcite and formulated rigorously by daniel fisher@xcite .",
    "fisher showed in particular that the scheme gives asymptotically exact results for the low energy universal behavior of systems controlled by infinite randomness fixed points .",
    "for example the random spin-1/2 heisenberg chain , flows toward a ground state decribed by an infinite randomness fixed point , the random singlet phase , for any amount of bare disorder@xcite .",
    "somewhat richer physics is at play in the random transverse field ising chain@xcite .",
    "this model exhibits a quantum phase transition between a magnetically ordered and a paramegnetic phase that is controlled by an infinite randomness fixed point .",
    "the analysis of the ising model was extended to two dimensions by motrunich et .",
    "@xcite , who found a similar transition controlled by an infinite randomness fixed fixed point .",
    "the sdrg approach has since been applied and extended to address a host of problems spanning different fields .",
    "these include classical stochastic dynamics@xcite , dynamic response of spin chains at low temperatures@xcite , entanglement in random spin chains@xcite and most recently non - equilibrium quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "for a comprehensive account of the technique and its various applications , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the goal of this brief review is twofold .",
    "first , we aim to provide a clear and compact introduction to the sdrg method and the physical considerations involved in its application .",
    "the second objective is to review recent progress in understanding the superfluid - to - insulator transition of interacting bosons in a random potential from the standpoint of sdrg .",
    "in contrast to other problems mentioned above , it is not immediately clear why the sdrg should be a suitable approach to characterize the superfluid - insulator transition .",
    "in fact an accepted theory of boson localization in one dimension is perturbative in the disorder@xcite .",
    "it predicts a critical point at which disorder is ( dangerously ) irrelevant .",
    "however , it has recently been argued that the superfluid may undergo a very different localization transition if the bare disorder is sufficiently strong@xcite .",
    "moreover , as we shall discuss , the superfluid phase itself may become anomalous due to the strong disorder .",
    "the rest of the review is structured as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we review the technique using the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain as an example to illustrate the scheme and how it is used to extract universal physical properties . in section [ sec : bosons ] we turn to the application of sdrg to the superfluid insulator transition of bosons in a random one dimensional potential .",
    "we contrast the strong - disorder theory with the weak disorder analysis of giamarchi and schulz @xcite . in section [ sec : extensions ] we discuss extensions of the sdrg analysis to bosonic systems with ohmic dissipation and to bosons in two dimensions .",
    "in the standard application of sdrg to random systems the aim is to solve for the universal properties of the ground state and low energy excitations . as in any rg scheme , we focus on low energies by successively eliminating high energy modes , thereby generating a series of effective hamiltonians acting on the thinning hilbert space . within field theory , this program is often facilitated by the weakness of the non - linear coupling that mixes high and low frequencies .",
    "what is the guiding principle that allows to safely eliminate high energy modes of a random system without changing its low energy physics ?    the key is the local separation of scales effected by the strong randomness .",
    "a grain of the system with atypically high energy near the cutoff scale @xmath1 , is likely to be surrounded by much weaker couplings .",
    "the broader the disorder distribution the more the chosen grain sticks out of its surrounding , thereby allowing a perturbative treatment of the coupling between the grain and its lower energy neighbors . lets see how it works in a concrete example .",
    "we now explain the procedure through the simple example of a random spin-1/2 heisenberg chain@xcite . h=_ij_i * s*_i_i+1 the motivation to study this model came from experiments done on quasi-1d organic salts , mostly @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these salts have chains of stacked double benzene rings , with each pair having one excess spin-1/2 .",
    "the measured susceptibility behaves as a power - law @xmath3 with @xmath4 and varying from sample to sample . recall that the currie susceptibility of free spins is @xmath5 .",
    "let us assume that the exchange coupling @xmath6 between the spins is widely distributed .",
    "somewhere on a finite chain there is a bond @xmath7 having the largest exchange coupling which we denote by @xmath8 ( from now on we denote the upper energy cutoff of the chain by @xmath1 ) . because the distribution is wide",
    ", the largest bond is much stronger than a typical bond and in particular it is likely to be much larger than the neighboring bonds , that is @xmath9 .",
    "therefore in our search for the ground state of the chain we can first diagonalize the strongest bond with @xmath10 and treat the couplings to the rest of the chain as a perturbation .    at zeroth order the degenerate low energy manifold of the chain consists of the spins @xmath11 frozen to a singlet state , whereas all other spins of the chain are free .",
    "the effective hamiltonian acting within this subspace is obtained through degenerate perturbation theory in all the other couplings . at first order",
    "we retrieve all the original nearest neighbor couplings along the chain , except the coupling of the strong pair to their left and right neighbors .",
    "a new coupling between the left and right neighbor spins is generated at second order of perturbation theory through virtual occupation of the excited states of the strong pair at energy @xmath1 : _",
    "l-1,l+2=j_l-1 j_l+12*s*_l-1_l+2 .",
    "we thereby eliminate the two strongest interacting spins and reconnect the chain by generating an effective coupling between the spins to the left and right of the decimated bond : j^_l-1,l+2=j_l-1,j_l+1[jeff ] we expect this perturbation theory , controlled by the small parameter @xmath12 , to work almost every time in the limit of strong disorder .",
    "crucially , after the decimation step we have exactly the same form of the hamiltonian : a nearest - neighbor heisenberg model .",
    "the next stage in our analysis must be repeated application of the decimation step .",
    "this leads to gradual renormalization of the distribution of the exchange constants @xmath6 upon decreasing the cutoff @xmath1 .",
    "if the disorder increases with repeated decimation , then we are safe .",
    "the strong disorder assumption only becomes better and better .",
    "this is indeed the case as we will show below .      ,",
    "width=453 ]    before going into the formal derivation of the flow equations , let us sketch a qualitative picture of the ground state that may be inferred from the structure of the rg decimation rules .",
    "a decimation of a bond essentially freezes two spins in a singlet state . at early stages of the rg , many singlets form between nearest neighbors .",
    "however , as more bonds are decimated , and the cutoff scale @xmath1 is reduced , the largest couplings may occur on bonds generated at earlier stages of the rg between further neighbors .",
    "eventually as @xmath13 is reduced far below its initial value singlets may form between very far sites .",
    "the qualitative picture of the ground state generated in this process shown in fig .",
    "[ rsfig4 ] looks like a random arrangements of non crossing singlet pairs occuring at all scales .",
    "hence the name random - singlet phase .    from this simple picture we can infer important information about the nature of the correlations in the system .",
    "suppose we are given a single realization of a random heisenberg chain .",
    "what is the typical correlation @xmath14 we will measure between two far removed spins @xmath15 and @xmath16 ?",
    "most likely these specific spins have not formed a singlet and therefore the correlation between them is very small - exponentially suppressed with distance ( as we shall see later , with the square root of the distance ) : c_ij^typical~e^-a .",
    "these are called the typical correlations .",
    "what if rather than a single realization the measurement averages over an ensemble of chains .",
    "this would be the case , for example , if we could do neutron scattering on a bulk sample of the material @xmath2 , which contains a macroscopic number of chains .",
    "the average over the many realizations could be dominated by rare instances in which the correlation @xmath17 is atypically strong .",
    "specifically , in the rare possibility that the two spins @xmath18 do happen to form a singlet , the correlation between them would be @xmath19 .",
    "how rare is that really ?",
    "if the two sites considered survive through the decimation procedure until they become nearest neighbors , then they are very likely to form a singlet .",
    "the probability of a site to survive to that stage , i.e. , until @xmath20 of its original nearest neighborson the side of the other site are removed , is @xmath21 ( this is the density of survivng sites at that stage ) .",
    "hence the probability of both sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 to survive to that stage is @xmath22 .",
    "we can now compute the average correlation to be _",
    "ij=(-1)p_s+e^-a(1-p_s)-p_s~1(i - j)^2 ,    so despite the localized nature of the ground state , the average correlations fall off only as a power law . this is a good example of _ griffiths effects _",
    "@xcite , where the average correlations of a random system are dominated by rare instances with anomalously strong correlations .",
    "let us now show how detailed and precise information about the ground state and low - energy correlations is obtained , following fisher @xcite . the key step is to translate the dasgupta - ma decimation rules into a master equation describing how the repeated decimations renormalize the probability distribution of exchange couplings when they operate on an ensemble of hamiltonians .",
    "let us denote by @xmath23 the distribution of @xmath24 in the physical system of interest .",
    "as we decimate more bonds while reducing the cutoff scale from @xmath25 to @xmath1 the distribution evolves to @xmath26 . to derive the master equation that governs this evolution , it is much better to replace @xmath24 and @xmath27 by the dimensionless scaling variable @xmath28 and rg scale parameter @xmath29 .",
    "while @xmath24 was defined on the changing interval @xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 is always defined on the interval @xmath32 $ ] . in particular @xmath33",
    "corresponds to the bond with largest exchange coupling @xmath34 . in these variables",
    "the dasgupta - ma decimation rule ( [ jeff ] ) takes the additive form : _",
    "i-1,i+2=_i+_i+1 + 2 [ dasmalog ] due to the strong disorder assumption , @xmath35 is almost always much greater than @xmath36 , and it will therefore be safe to ignore the latter in eq .",
    "( [ dasmalog ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to derive the master equation for the distribution of @xmath37 s - which we denote @xmath38 . integrating out the high energy shell",
    "@xmath39 $ ] consists of two stages : ( i ) remove all the strong bonds with @xmath40 and redefine the remaining @xmath37 s according to the new cutoff , ( ii ) add the couplings generated through second - order perturbation theory across the decimated bonds .",
    "let s consider the contribution of stage ( i ) to the change of the distribution function .",
    "having reduced the cutoff we need to redefine the @xmath41 on every remaining bond : _",
    "m_m - d==_m-=_m - d .",
    "so the entire distribution @xmath42 moves to the left",
    ". this can be expressed mathematically : dp()=d .",
    "[ m1 ]    now consider the contribution from stage ( ii ) , which is adding the renormalized bonds .",
    "the rg rule ( [ dasmalog ] ) prescribes how the distribution of the new bonds derives from that of the original constituent ( left and right ) bonds : p_()=_0^d_l_0^d_r p(_l)p(_r)(-_l-_r-2 ) the contribution of these bonds to the full distribution should be scaled by their fraction in the total population . since the new bonds are produced only where we find a strong bond the probability of generating them is the probability to find a strong bond @xmath43 $ ] that is @xmath44 . from this",
    "we get the contribution of the newly generated bonds to the full distribution @xmath45 .    putting the two contributions together",
    "we obtain the master equation :    = + p(0)_0^d__0^d_r p(_)p(_r)(-_-_r ) , [ me ] where we dropped the @xmath27 subscript of @xmath42 and neglected the @xmath46 in the @xmath47-function .",
    "there is a point we glossed over .",
    "we removed some probability by getting rid of all the probability density at small @xmath37 , and we added probability by adding all the new bonds .",
    "do we need to adjust the normalization of our distribution function ? integrating both sides of eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) reveals that the normalization is unchanged . for each bond we lost",
    ", we added a renormalized bond .",
    "the additive nature of the decimation rule ( [ dasmalog ] ) , embodied in the @xmath47-function that appears in the master equation ( [ me ] ) suggests a potential solution in the form of an exponential distribution @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , plugging this ansatz into ( [ me ] ) leads to an ordinary differential equation for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , which is solved by @xmath51 .",
    "hence we obtain the self similar solution p_()=1e^-/. we see that the system flows to infinite randomness as the width of the distribution grows without limit",
    ". converting back to the physical variables we obtain a power law distribution of effective exchange coupling _",
    "( j)= 1 ( j)^1 - 1/ [ rs - dist ] this approaches a non - normalizable distribution @xmath52 at the fixed point . again a sign of infinite randomness .",
    "the distribution ( [ rs - dist ] ) is an attractor of the rg flow .",
    "moreover , it turns out to be a global attractor .",
    "the nearest neighbor heisenberg chain flows to the same infinite randomness fixed point regardless of the initial distribution as long as the disorder is not correlated . hence the results we will extract for the low energy physics are universal .",
    "an important step in calculating physical properties is to establish a relation between energy scale @xmath1 and length scale .",
    "a typical length scale is the distance between surviving spins at the scale @xmath1 .",
    "lets compute the number of surviving spins on the original chain .",
    "every time we decimate a strong bond , we remove two .",
    "therefore , upon changing the rg scale by @xmath53 , the number changes by @xmath54 .",
    "recall from the above solution that @xmath55 ; hence @xmath56 .",
    "the average distance between surviving spins is then @xmath57 , or converting to energy units : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the original lattice spacing .",
    "this means that the _ excitation energy _ of singlets of length @xmath60 is : j_~- , which is contrary to usual quantum - critical point scaling where @xmath61 .",
    "this type of scaling is called infinite - randomness scaling .",
    "we are now in position to compute the spin susceptibility at temperature @xmath62 .",
    "lets run the rg decimation from the upper cutoff @xmath63 down to @xmath64 .",
    "the decimated spins are essentially frozen into singlets and therefore do not contribute to the susceptibility . on the other hand , surviving spins at the scale @xmath1 are typically coupled by bonds @xmath65 , and therefore expected to behave as free spins .",
    "they contribute a currie susceptibility @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the density of surviving spins on the chain at energy scale @xmath64 . from our previous calculation",
    "we have @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , ( t)=. this is not quite @xmath69 , but on a log scale it is indistinguishable from a power law .",
    "let us now turn to the second aim of this review : the application of the sdrg method to interacting bosons propagating in a random potential .",
    "our analysis focuses on the quantum rotor hamiltonian : = _ j u_j ( _ j-_j)^2 -_j j_j (_j+1-_j ) , [ model ] where on each site the phase @xmath70 and charge @xmath71 are conjugate variables , which obey @xmath72=-i\\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "this model describes an effective josephson - junction array ( see fig . [",

    "the generic case , as well as the more restricted @xmath78 disorder classes , were considered in ref .",
    "the different classes of disorder give rise to distinct insulating phases , but cause nearly unnoticeable differences in the behavior at the critical point .    besides josephson junction arrays",
    "there are several other important physical realizations of the model ( [ model ] ) . in systems of ultra - cold trapped atoms",
    ", disorder can be generated by optical speckle patterns@xcite , incommensurate lattice potential@xcite , or by corrugation in the wire that generates the trapping magnetic field in atom chips @xcite . with increasing disorder",
    ", the atoms concentrate in small puddles at minima of the potential connected by random josephson coupling which depends on the potential barrier between them .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) can be rigorously derived and the distributions of coupling constants computed ab - initio @xcite .",
    "finally , disordered superconducting nano - wires with no unpaired gapless electrons will also be generically described by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) .    more generally , the model ( [ model ] ) is a good effective description for superfluid to insulator transition driven by phase fluctuations .",
    "it can be thought of as a low energy effective theory for the phase degrees of freedom , after integrating out the gapped amplitude fluctuations .      before describing the strong - disorder theory ,",
    "let us briefly review the common understanding of the superfluid insulator transition in one dimension , taking the weak disorder viewpoint .",
    "the weak disorder theory was formulated in a seminal paper by giamarchi and schulz ( gs ) ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the weak disorder expansion is natural to carry out when the action is written in terms of charge variables that live on the bonds rather than on the sites .",
    "j=_ij n_i .",
    "the current through the @xmath15th bond is then @xmath79 , and the charge on the @xmath15th site is @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the charging energy of the site is @xmath81 .",
    "what about the josephson energy ?",
    "if we neglect phase slips , a josephson junction is essentially an inductor with inductance @xmath82 .",
    "therefore the josephson energy in this approximation is : @xmath83 we are tempted to write the lagrangian in this representation as _ 0=_i [ gs - latt ] but this expression does not capture the periodicity of the josephson energy with respect to the phase difference accross the junction . to account for the periodicity , we must allow for phase slips that change @xmath84 .",
    "since the phase and charge are canonical conjugates , the translation of all phases to the left of the junction @xmath15 by @xmath85 is achieved by the operator @xmath86=e^{\\pm 2\\pi i \\phi_i}$ ] .",
    "such terms should be included and assigned an action cost : _ ps=- _",
    "i (2_i ) @xmath87 is the fugacity ( or rate ) of phase slips , and strongly depends on both @xmath6 and @xmath88 .",
    "the total lagrangian is given by @xmath89 .",
    "within the weak disorder limit , the randomness in @xmath90 and @xmath91 that appears in @xmath92 is perturbatively irrelevant .",
    "furthermore , the disorder in @xmath76 can be absorbed by shifts to @xmath93 .",
    "these shifts then appear in the @xmath94 term , and produce a combination of cosine and sine terms .",
    "rewriting the lagrangian in the continuum limit , with this in mind , gives dx ( ^2-v ( ) ^2)-a^-1 ( ( x ) e^2i+(x)^ * e^-2i ) [ gs - cont ] with @xmath95 a complex number , @xmath96 is the original lattice constant , @xmath97 the sound velocity , and @xmath98 the luttinger parameter ( our definition of @xmath98 is the inverse of the @xmath98 appearing in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the weak - disorder analysis proceeds by assuming a gaussian distribution of the disorder with @xmath99 .",
    "the disorder strength is parameterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath100 .",
    "next , momentum shell rg is used to find the flow of @xmath98 and @xmath100 .",
    "the result , quoted from @xcite is : = d ( 3 - 2k^),=-d k^2 .",
    "these scaling equations imply that the critical point is characterized by a _",
    "universal _ value of the luttinger parameter @xmath101 irrespective of the initial disorder strength .",
    "it is important to note , however , that obtaining the long - wavelength field theory ( [ gs - cont ] ) , with a single well defined luttinger parameter @xmath98 , relied on having weak disorder in @xmath24 and @xmath91 in the first place .",
    "we will see later what can go wrong with this mapping at strong disorder .",
    "our main task now is to develop a strong - disorder rg scheme for the random - boson problem . as in the original application of real space rg to disordered systems ,",
    "the strategy for finding the ground state and low lying excitations is to iteratively isolate and solve the strongest elements in the hamiltonian .",
    "there are two types of elements in the hamiltonian : onsite charging energies , and bond josephson couplings .",
    "roughly , two sites connected by the strongest bond will be converted to a phase - coherent cluster .",
    "similarly , in sites with strong charging interactions we will eliminate all the on - site excited states .",
    "first , we must determine what we mean by strong elements of the hamiltonian . the charging interaction",
    "can be considered while ignoring josephson couplings .",
    "it is natural to pick the charging - energy gap separating the ground state from excited charge states as the energy scale for decimation purposes .",
    "this gap is given by : _",
    "i = u_i(1 - 2|_i| ) [ cgap ] where @xmath102 . at the same time ,",
    "the energy scale , which characterizes a bond is the josephson coupling , @xmath6 .",
    "a strong bond is expected to bind two sites into a phase - coherent cluster .    at each step of the rg we eliminate the term responsible to the largest energy scale = _ i\\{j_i,_i}. [ ogap ] if the largest energy scale is a gap , @xmath103 , then the site @xmath15 freezes into the charge state with the lowest energy .",
    "quantum fluctuations induce an effective hopping between sites @xmath104 and @xmath105 : j_i-1,i+1=. this result , obtained by simple application of second order degenerate perturbation theory , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]b .",
    "the factor @xmath106 in the denominator varies between @xmath107 and @xmath108 ; it does not affect any universal features of the transition and we can safely set it to unity .    alternatively , when the strongest coupling in the chain is the bond @xmath6 , a phase - coherent cluster forms , with a phase @xmath109 .",
    "since charging energy is the inverse of capacitance , and the capacitance is additive , the effective @xmath110 of the new cluster will be : = + .",
    "[ urecurs ]    the offset charge @xmath111 in the cluster that forms in the bond decimation step , is simply the sum of the two offset charges : _",
    "i , i+1=_i+_2 .",

    "this decimation step is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model]c .",
    "we note that the energy scale @xmath34 eliminated in the bond decimation step is the energy barrier that needs to be overcome in order to generate a phase slip which breaks the coherence .",
    "the gap to internal fluctuations of the relative phase @xmath113 is in general much smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "fortunately virtual occupation of the josephson plasmon affects only a small change on the josephson coupling of the joined cluster to the neighboring sites , j_i-1j_i-1(1 - 18 ) , which we will find is negligible near the critical point .",
    "it is important to note here that the above decimation step _ does not _",
    "assume long range order ; it states that phase fluctuations within the newly - formed cluster are harmonic , and therefore the cluster can not be broken due to phase - slips .",
    "these harmonic fluctuations are crucial for the understanding of the properties of the superfluid phase , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sflutt ] .    before proceeding",
    ", we note that in this discussion we have consciously omitted another possible bond decimation step .",
    "suppose that the two sites linked by the strong bond with @xmath114 have large charging energies @xmath115 , but offset charges @xmath76 close to @xmath116 such that @xmath117 .",
    "these sites then have two nearly degenerate charging states , and behave effectively as spin-@xmath0 degrees of freedom rather than rotors .",
    "once connected with a large @xmath24 of order @xmath13 they will form a singlet state , i.e. , a single boson will be shared equally by them .",
    "these sites therefore are not joined to make an effective superfluid cluster , but rather are completely eliminated while generating @xmath118 between the left and right neighbor to the pair .",
    "this possibility is treated in ref .",
    "@xcite and is very important in describing the insulating phase . in this review",
    "we focus on the superfluid phase and the critical point , where the probability of finding two nearby sites with large @xmath91 is exceedingly small and can be neglected .",
    "the iteration scheme outlined above translates to a flow of distribution functions for the josephson couplings , interaction strengths , and offset charges . finding a solution of the flow equations is made easier if we parametrize the couplings in the hamiltonain appropriately .",
    "typically , the best parametrization is in terms of variables that make the decimation steps become approximate sum rules . for the josephson couplings",
    "this is achieved by using a logarithmic parametrization : _",
    "the charging energies are best expressed through the capacitance , which is additive in the cluster formation step .",
    "we define : _ i=/u_i .",
    "note that @xmath119 with @xmath120 the capacitance .",
    "offset charges are added up as well upon decimation , and therefore are good variables according to the above criterion . as the dimensionless flow parameter",
    ", we define as before : = , where @xmath25 is of the order of the largest bare energy scale in the hamiltonian .",
    "the distribution functions should reflect which hamiltonian parameters are correlated .",
    "clearly @xmath73 and @xmath76 must be correlated , since the decimation procedure eliminates sites with large @xmath121 .",
    "the elimination of sites with a large gap , therefore , introduces correlations between charging energies and offset charges on each site .",
    "the josephson couplings , however , remain uncorrelated with charging energies or offset charges in nearby sites .",
    "thus we can parametrize the coupling distribution functions in terms of two functions : @xmath122 the bond log - coupling distribution , and @xmath123 the joint distribution function of the inverse charging energy , and the offset charge . for the latter , it is useful to write : f(,)=f(,)(-1 + 2|| ) , where @xmath124 and the heaviside step function @xmath125 enforces the constraint @xmath126 or equivalently @xmath127 .",
    "we can now write the master flow equations for the distributions of coupling constants implied by the decimation rules discussed above : & = & g+f_1d_1 d_2 g(_1)g(_2)(-_1+_2)+g()(g_0 -f_1),[bgflow1 ] + & = & + g_0 d_1d_2d_1d_2 f(_1,_1)f(_2,_2 ) ( -_1+_2)(-_1+_2 ) + & & + f(1+f_1-g_0 ) .[bgflow2 ] let us recount the origin of all terms contributing to the derivatives @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "first , a trivial , yet important , effect on the distributions stems from changing the cutoff @xmath1 .",

    "it is natural to ask at this point if there is a simple observable that can bear witness to this distribution and allow to measure @xmath161 .",

    "quantum fluctuations due to sites with large charging energy drive the downward flow of @xmath161 toward the fixed point , where @xmath191 . the superfluid stiffness and compressibility , on the other hand , are not universal properties on the fixed point , but must be integrated along the flow .",
    "for example , the stiffness of the final superfluid cluster spanning the chain depends on all the effective internal bonds @xmath198 that connect the sites making that cluster and were decimated in the process of its formation : @xmath199 . similarly , the compressibility is the sum of capacitances of all sites making up the superfluid cluster : @xmath200 . in both cases @xmath170 is the total length of the chain .",
    "these quantities were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite on the critical manifold showing that they approach a constant value that depends on the initial disorder for the flow .",
    "for the sake of comparison with the weak disorder theory of giamarchi and schulz @xcite it is interesting to look at the luttinger parameter , given by @xmath201 .",
    "there , the fully renormalized luttinger parameter at the transition takes a universal value @xmath101 . on the other hand , for the strong - disorder transition",
    ", the sdrg predicts a value of the luttinger parameter that depends on where the critical manifold was crossed .",
    "that value diverges as the crossing point gets closer to the classical fixed point at @xmath192 .",
    "the non universal value of the luttinger parameter at the transition point is the most controversial prediction of the sdrg in the strong disorder regime@xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that since the luttinger parameter does not appear as a natural scaling variable in the sdrg , computing its value requires a rather elaborate integration over the entire critical rg flow from high to low energies .",
    "hence it is not surprising that its value on the critical manifold comes out non universal within this theory .",
    "but because the luttinger parameter is not a natural object to compute within the sdrg it is important to verify this prediction in numerical simulations .",
    "such calculations will be discussed in section [ sec : numerics ] .    despite this difference , there is at least a formal similarity between the strong - disorder fixed - point and the kosterlitz - thouless flow at weak disorder . as we already pointed out , the reduced flow equations are formally identical to the kosterlitz - thouless equations , where the parameters @xmath161 and @xmath169 of the distribution functions are playing the roles that the luttinger parameter and phase - slip fugacity play in the kosterlitz - thouless flow . as a consequence ,",

    "different constraints on the distribution of @xmath74 give rise to three distinct insulating phases .",
    "the physical properties of these insulators are largely determined by the charging gap distribution of the sites that survive the rg flow deep into the insulating region .",
    "the possibilities are as follows :    * _ bose - glass phase  _ a generic distribution of offset charges , @xmath202 , results in a bose - glass phase .",
    "this is a compressible and gapless state , which is also characterized by a diverging superfluid susceptibility .",
    "the gaplessness and compressibility are due to the presence of a finite density of sites with a charging energy arbitrarily close to zero .",

    "the system then flows to the mott - glass phase ; an _ incompressible _ yet gapless state with a finite superfluid susceptibility .",

    "the distribution @xmath209 has no support at @xmath210 , which implies incompressibility .",
    "specifically : ~e^-f_0()0 where @xmath211 is the probing chemical potential . by looking at the smallest charging energy for a system of size @xmath170 , we find that the gap drops as @xmath212 .",
    "the mott - glass is a classic example of a griffiths phase : it is incompressible , yet the average temporal auto - correlations of the system will be dominated by the essentially single large cluster of size @xmath213 that determines the gap . * _ random - singlet glass  _",
    "if @xmath78 is randomly either @xmath214 or @xmath215 , the gapless insulating phase has both a diverging compressibility and diverging superfluid susceptibility . only sites with @xmath214 and no charging gap survive late in the flow as two level systems .",
    "thus , the insulator is described by an effective random spin-@xmath0 @xmath216 chain , known to be in the random singlet phase @xcite .",

    ". it is , therefore , desirable to seek numerical verification of the theoretically predicted universal physics .",
    "some of the recent work that addressed this question is summarized by pollet in another review published in this volume@xcite . in what follows",
    "we will survey the numerical results and comment on the debate surrounding their interpretation .",
    "since we are dealing with a strongly correlated system , a fully quantum calculation , such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) or density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) are needed to extract the critical properties .",
    "it is important to understand the fundamental difficulties , which complicate these numerical calculations in the strong disorder regime .",
    "first , according to the sdrg , rare weak links generated in the course of renormalization play a crucial role in driving the transition at strong disorder .",
    "this implies that a very large ensemble of different realizations of the random chain needs to be analyzed in order to detect the effect of rare events on the physics .",
    "second , when rare weak links are effective they slow down the convergence of numerical methods such as qmc and dmrg .",

    "these simulations show kt - like scaling of the correlation length at the transition both for weak and strong disorder . above a certain disorder strength ,",

    "<S> this brief review introduces the method and application of real - space renormalization group to strongly disordered quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the focus is on recent applications of the strong disorder renormalization group to the physics of disordered - boson systems and the superfluid - insulator transition in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that there is also a well understood weak disorder theory for this problem allows to illustrate what aspects of the physics change at strong disorder . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the strong disorder rg analysis suggests that the transitions at weak disorder and strong disorder belong to distinct universality classes , but this question remains under debate and is not fully resolved to date . </S>",
    "<S> further applications of the strong disorder renormalization group to higher - dimensional bose systems and to bosons coupled to dissipation are also briefly reviewed . </S>"
