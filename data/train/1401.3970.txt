    "blazars are a special subclass of active galactic nuclei with a relativistic jet oriented at a small angle with respect to the line of sight .",
    "they usually show extreme variability , a high degree of polarization , and a strong non - thermal continuum in the optical / uv band .",
    "blazars can be divided into two subclasses : flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lac objects .",
    "bl lacs have the lack or weakness of the emission lines , while fsrqs usually present strong broad emission lines . the spectrum energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars",
    "are dominated by non - thermal emission and consist of two distinct , broad components : a low - energy component from radio through uv or x - ray , and a high - energy component from x - ray to @xmath0-ray .",
    "it is widely believed that the low - energy component of blazar seds is synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the jet , whereas the origin of high component is still a matter of debate .",
    "there are two classes of models to explain high energy emission : leptonic model and hadronic model . in the leptonic model ,",
    "the high energy emission is produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of electrons on a photon field ( e.g. , bttcher 2007 ) .",
    "possible soft photons are the synchrotron photons produced within the jet ( the synchrotron self - compton , ssc , process ; maraschi et al . 1992 ; bloom and marscher 1996 ; zhang et al . 2012 ) or the photons external to the jet ( the external compton , ec , process ; dermer and schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora et al .",
    "1994 ; blzejowski et al . 2000 ) such as the accretion disk , the broad line region , or the external torus . in the hadronic model ,",
    "the high energy emission is produced by proton synchrotron or secondary emission from proton - protons and proton - photon interactions @xcite .    to data",
    ", more than 40 blazars have been detected in the tev band , most of these objects are high - frequency - peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) .",
    "the primary tev photons from distant blazars are absorbed due to pair production by interacting with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) photons @xcite , the intrinsic tev spectrum is harder than observed one . the tev emission from hbls can generally explained by the standard ssc model well .",
    "however , the observations of blazars with very hard gamma - ray spectrum from some hbls presented a challenge to the standard ssc model .",
    "one characteristic case is the very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-ray emission from distant blazar 1es 1101 - 232 , which is detected by the h.e.s.s .",
    "array of cherenkov telescopes @xcite .",
    "the vhe @xmath0-ray data implied a very hard intrinsic spectrum with a peak in the sed above 3 tev and a photon index @xmath1 , even when corrected by absorption for the lowest ebl level @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior has also been detected in the tev blazar 1es 0229 + 200 @xcite , mrk 501@xcite and 1es 0414 + 009 @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to produce such hard @xmath0-ray spectrum in the context of the one - zone ssc scenario .",
    "the standard shock acceleration theory predicted an electron spectrum with index @xmath2 , which corresponds to an intrinsic photon index @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the suppression of scattering cross section at high energies due to klein - nishina ( kn ) effect would make the @xmath0-ray spectrum to be steeper .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the orphan tev flare of 1es 1959 + 650 based on hadronic model , they explained this orphan tev flare as the decay of neutral pions produced through the p@xmath0 interactions with the low - energy tails of ssc photons .",
    "the decay of neutral pions are also applied to explain the multi - tev @xmath0-ray emission from the centaurus a and m 87 @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the x - ray and @xmath0-ray variability of mrk 421 using leptohadronic model , they suggested that the model based on pion decay can produce the quadratic variability between the x - ray and tev band in a much more natural way .",
    "moreover , the h.e.s.s . observation of 1es 1101 - 232 shows no evidence for significant variability on any time scale .",
    "the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum may indicate that there is the contribution of an additional spectral component beyond the common ssc emission .",
    "it is possible that hard @xmath0-ray spectrum has a hadronic origin . motivated by the above arguments , in this paper we study the possible origin of hard spectrum for distant tev blazar .",
    "we suggest that the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum for blazar 1es 1101 - 232 may originate from the decay of neutral pion produced through proton - photon interactions with the synchrotron photons within the jet .    in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of the model . in section 3",
    "we apply the model to explain the very hard tev spectrum from 1es 1101 - 232 .",
    "the discussion and conclusion are presented in section 4 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters of @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the ssc model has been successfully used to explain the multi - band seds of blazars .",
    "we use the model given by @xcite to calculate synchrotron and ssc flux .",
    "we assume a spherical blob of the jet moving with lorentz factor @xmath8 at a small angle @xmath9 with the line of sight , which is filled by relativistic electrons with a uniform magnetic field . the observed radiation is strongly boosted by a doppler factor @xmath10^{-1}$ ] .",
    "since blazar jets are almost aligned to the line of sight of the observer , we assume the doppler factor @xmath11 . throughout the paper , unprimed quantities refer to the observer s frame and primed quantities to the blob s frame .",
    "we adopt a broken power - law function with a sharp cut - off to describe the electron energy distribution in the emission region : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is broken energy , @xmath14 is the normalization factor , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the electron power - law indexes below and above broken energy @xmath13 .      the variable and non - thermal high - energy emission from blazars implied that the jet of blazars can efficiently accelerate particles to very high energy by fermi shock acceleration .",
    "the electron acceleration is limited by important radiative loss , protons should be accelerated with higher efficiency and can reach very high energy by the same acceleration mechanisms .",
    "if protons are accelerated to sufficient high energy to reach the threshold for proton - photon interactions , the high - energy protons would interact with the jet synchrotron photons to produce pions .",
    "the charged pion would decay to produce the neutrinos and secondary electrons / positrons .",
    "the neutrinos from the charged pion could be detected in neutrino telescopes , such as icecube @xcite .",
    "decay of the neutral pion would result in high - energy @xmath0-ray emission , which is directly observed by ground - based telescope up to the tev energy .",
    "also , a correlation between the low - energy and high - energy bump is not necessary . on the other hand",
    ", the decay of neutral pion from proton - photon interactions would describe the high - energy bump of blazar seds .",
    "the pion production channels through the @xmath17 interactions are @xmath18 the revelent pion decay channels are @xmath19 the threshold condition for the @xmath17 interactions is given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the proton and soft photon energy in the comoving frame .",
    "for high energy protons we set @xmath23 . in the case of a head - on collision ( @xmath24 ) , equation ( 5 ) implies @xmath25 in the single - pion production channels , each pion carries @xmath26 of proton energy .",
    "consider that each @xmath27 decay into two @xmath0-ray photons , the observed @xmath0-ray energy from @xmath27 decay is @xmath28    we follow the method of @xcite to calculate the spectrum from @xmath27 decay .",
    "the cooling rate due to the p@xmath0 interactions with the synchrotron radiation field is given by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30=145 mev is the photon threshold energy , @xmath31 is the number density of the synchrotron radiation given by @xcite .",
    "the section cross @xmath32 is approximately given by @xcite @xmath33 and the inelasticity coefficient is @xmath34 the corresponding collision rate is given by a similar expression @xmath35 the photon emissivity from @xmath27 decay in the @xmath36-function approximation is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean number of neutral pions created per collision , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are possibilities of the p@xmath0 interaction in single - pion and multi - pion channels , and @xmath41 is the proton energy distribution",
    ". we can define a mean inelasticity as @xmath42 , then the possibilities @xmath43 can be calculated from the relation of @xmath44 , where @xmath45=0.2 and @xmath46=0.6 .",
    "taking into account the relativistic and cosmological effects , we get the observed flux from the secondary emission as @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the redshift of the source , @xmath49 is the luminosity distance , @xmath50 is the volume of the emission region , and @xmath51 is the photon energy in the observed frame .    the emissivity of secondary pairs can be estimated in the same way .",
    "both in the single - pion and multiple - pion channel , each charged pion has an energy @xmath52 .",
    "this energy is equally distributed among the products of its decay , hence the energy of each electron / positron is @xmath53 .",
    "the emissivity of secondary pairs is given by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mean number of charged pions created per collision .",
    "if we neglect the electron escape , the steady electron distribution can be calculated as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the electron energy loss rate , @xmath58 is the magnetic energy density . in the following ,",
    "we use the method of @xcite to calculate the synchrotron radiation from the secondary electrons .",
    "protons should be co - accelerated together with electron by the fermi acceleration mechanism , which predicts the particle distribution index @xmath592 .",
    "we adopt the proton injection spectrum with exponential cutoff power - law : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the initial proton distribution . in our calculation",
    ", we assume that the proton injection index to be @xmath62 , and the minimum energy of the injection proton to be @xmath63 mev , which is the threshold energy of proton - photon interactions .",

    ", @xcite performed the coordinated optical - x - ray - vhe @xmath0-ray observation in 2004 and 2005 , which results in the discovery of vhe @xmath0-ray . taking the vhe data from h.e.s.s observation together with measurements in the x - ray and optical bands",
    ", @xcite constructed the truly simultaneous sed of 1es 1101 - 232 from the optical to the vhe band in 2004 and 2005 .",
    "however , no simultaneous gev observation was performed in this multi - wavelength campaign .",
    "the gev data is important to constrain the radiation model of blazars . in the gev band ,",
    "egret did not detect emission from 1es 1101 - 232 @xcite .",
    "the detections of 1es 1101 - 232 were also not reported in the large area telescope ( lat ) bright active galactic nuclei source list @xcite .",
    "fermi - lat reported the significant detections of 1es 1101 - 232 in the first lat agn catalog @xcite and in the second lat agn catalog @xcite .",
    "however , only the flux upper limits are available from the literature @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the fermi - lat 3.5 year data collected from 2008 august to 2012 february and reported the gev spectrum of 1es 1101 - 232 .",
    "the previous ssc model indicated that the ic peak is expected to be around 100 gev @xcite .",
    "however , new observational results from h.e.s.s indicate that the source shows a hard vhe spectrum with a peak in the sed above 3 tev , when corrected by absorption for the lowest ebl level @xcite . in this paper , we use simultaneous sed of 1es 1101 - 232 collected by @xcite in 2004 and 2005 and the gev data given by @xcite .",
    "we use the model described in section 2 to model the simultaneous sed of 1es 1101 - 232 in 2004 june and 2005 march .",
    "the observed data are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the vhe data is corrected for the ebl absorption considering the low ebl level , as described in @xcite .",
    "the modeling parameters are listed in table 1 - 2 .",
    "it can be found that the poynting flux power @xmath65 is slightly larger than the electron power @xmath66 , the relativistic proton power @xmath67 is far larger than the poynting flux @xmath65 , and the total jet power is dominated by relativistic protons .",
    "our model requires the extreme proton power @xmath68 erg s@xmath5 to produce the @xmath0-ray through the proton - photon interactions efficiently .",
    "@xcite used the leptonic and hadronic model to fit the observed sed of a set of fermi - lat - detected blazars , they also showed that the hadronic model usually requires the extreme jet powers , in some case exceeding @xmath69 erg s@xmath5 in relativistic protons .",
    "the corresponding sed modeling is shown in figure 1 - 2 .",
    "it can be seen that the optical and x - ray radiation comes from the synchrotron radiation of primary electrons and secondary pairs , the gev emission is produced by the ssc process , the hard tev emission originates from the @xmath27 decay produced through proton - photon interactions with the synchrotron photons .",
    "our model can reproduce the observed sed of 1es 1101 - 232 well , particularly the very hard @xmath0-ray spectrum . in our model , the energy of secondary pairs is @xmath70 tev , the corresponding synchrotron frequency in the observed frame is @xmath71 ) hz , which could nt contribute to the gev and tev emission .",
    "moreover , the synchrotron emission from secondary pairs has a small contribution to the optical and x - ray flux compared to that from the primary electrons .",
    "we can estimate the proton energy through the observed vhe @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "for the source 1es 1101 - 232 , the highest photon energy is @xmath72 tev . from equation 7",
    ", we can obtain that the proton energy in the comoving frame is @xmath73 tev , which is comparable with the value derived from our sed modeling .",
    "this value corresponding to the observed frame is @xmath74 tev , if the proton can escape the source and reach the observer without energy loss .",
    "therefore , the observed proton energy is @xmath75 tev .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray energy is in the range @xmath76 tev@xmath77 tev .",
    "using the equation 6 and 7 , we can obtain that the corresponding target photon energy in proton - photon interactions is in the range @xmath78 hz@xmath79 hz , which exactly falls in the high - energy part of the synchrotron spectrum , and the ssc flux in this energy range is negligible compared to the synchrotron flux .",
    "this indicated that hard @xmath0-ray spectrum may come from the @xmath27 decay produced through proton - photon interactions with the synchrotron photons .",
    "it should be noted that the target photon energy of proton - photon interactions lies in the low - energy tails of ssc spectrum in the paper by @xcite , rather than the synchrotron photons .",
    "moreover , the hard x - ray emission at the energy @xmath80 100 kev has been detected by swift - bat in several tev blazars @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the hard x - ray observation of tev blazar 1es 0229 + 200 , they showed that the x - ray spectrum is extended up to @xmath81 100 kev without any significant cut - off .",
    "it is possible that the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum originates in the @xmath27 decay produced through proton - photon interactions with the high - energy parts of the synchrotron photons within the jet .",
    "the efficiency of the proton - photon interaction depends on the density and distribution of the target photons . in our model ,",
    "the high - energy proton efficiently interacts with the high - energy parts of the synchrotron photons to product the @xmath0-ray .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of the proton - photon interactions depends on the distribution of the synchrotron photons .",
    "however , the distribution of the synchrotron photons in turn depends on the maximum lorentz factor @xmath82 . in figure 3",
    ", we show the modeling spectrum with the various values of the maximum lorentz factor @xmath83 .",
    "it can be seen that the synchrotron flux at high energies decreases with the decreasing maximum lorentz factor , which results in the decreasing efficiency of the @xmath0-ray production through the proton - photon interactions .",
    "our model requires the maximum lorentz factor @xmath84 in order to fit the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum from blazar 1es 1101 - 232 .",
    "the acceleration timescale of electron is @xmath85 .",
    "the synchrotron cooling timescale is @xmath86",
    ". then the maximum lorentz factor @xmath83 can be determined by the condition @xmath87 as @xmath88 hence , the required maximum lorentz factor @xmath84 is achievable by the fermi acceleration mechanism in the jet of blazar 1es 1101 - 232 .",
    "the proton - proton ( pp ) interactions with the ambient matter can produce the tev @xmath0-ray , as has been proposed to explain the observed seds of blazars @xcite .",
    "however , the pp interaction usually requires the high plasma density @xmath89 @xmath90 @xcite , such a high density would not be expected in the environment of bl lac objects due to small accretion rate .",
    "therefore , the pp interaction is less efficient than the p@xmath0 interaction .",
    "the different theoretical models has been proposed to explain the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "@xcite suggested that the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum can be explained in the ssc scenarios by assuming a narrow distribution of high - energy electrons with the high low - energy cutoff .",
    "it is difficult to maintain such high low - energy cutoff because of the relevant radiation cooling at these energies .",
    "the internal absorption of the tev @xmath0-ray spectrum by a very narrow distribution of optical uv photons in the vicinity of agn can explain the observed hard @xmath0-ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , there is no indication for the present of such narrow radiation fields in the vicinity of bl lac objects .",
    "a two - component model has been proposed to explain the observed sed of 1es 1101 - 232 @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the low - frequency emission is assumed to originate in the inner region of jet , the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum can be produced via compton upscattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in an extend jet .",
    "however , this scenario requires that the electrons can be accelerated to tev energy on kiloparsec scales along the jet .",
    "the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum can be explained by the secondary emission produced along the line of sight by the interactions of the cosmic - ray protons with the background photons @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the low extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmfs ) not larger than @xmath91 g is needed to avoid the significant deflection of cosmic - ray protons and secondary electrons , but the strength of egmf along with the line of sight remains large uncertain . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted secondary spectrum fits well the hard tev spectrum only for the high level ebl model of @xcite , which are excluded by the fermi - lat and h.e.s.s results @xcite .",
    "alternatively , new particles @xcite and lorentz invariance violation @xcite have been invoked to explain the data .",
    "a number of blazars are found to exhibit the correlated variability between the low - energy and vhe band .",
    "several blazars have displayed minute timescale variability in the tev band @xcite .",
    "no significant correlated variability between the optical / x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands was observed from this source . at the same time , the vhe data from h.e.s.s show no sign of variability on any time scale .",
    "this seemly supports a hadronic origin of hard @xmath0-ray spectrum from blazar 1es 1101 - 232 . in the paper",
    ", we study the possible origin of hard @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "we propose a model to explain the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum from blazar 1es 1101 - 232 . in this model ,",
    "the optical and x - ray radiation comes from the synchrotron radiation of primary electrons and secondary pairs , in which the synchrotron radiation from the secondary pairs has a small contribution to the optical and x - ray flux , and the gev emission is attributed to the ssc process , however , the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum originates in the @xmath27 decay produced through proton - photon interactions with the synchrotron photons within the jet . assuming suitable electron and proton spectra , we obtain a excellent fit to the observed spectrum of blazar 1es 1101 - 232 . the very hard @xmath0-ray spectrum can be well explained by secondary emission from the @xmath27 decay in the source",
    ". however , our model requires the extreme proton power in order to efficiently produce the @xmath0-ray through proton - photon interactions .",

    "<S> the very hard @xmath0-ray spectrum from distant blazars challenges the traditional synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model , which may indicate that there is the contribution of an additional high - energy component beyond the ssc emission . in this paper , we study the possible origin of the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum from distant blazars . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a model to explain the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum from blazar 1es 1101 - 232 . in the model , </S>",
    "<S> the optical and x - ray radiation would come from the synchrotron radiation of primary electrons and secondary pairs , the gev emission would be produced by the ssc process , however , the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum would originate from the decay of neutral pion produced through proton - photon interactions with the synchrotron radiation photons within the jet . </S>",
    "<S> our model can explain the observed sed of 1es 1101 - 232 well , especially the very hard @xmath0-ray spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , our model requires the very large proton power to efficiently produce the @xmath0-ray through proton - photon interactions . </S>"
