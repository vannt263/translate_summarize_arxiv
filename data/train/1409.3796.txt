    "a major task situated at the crossroad of stellar astrophysics , also encompassing orbital stability studies and astrobiology , is the identification of habitable zones ( hzs ) of stars , including binaries and multi - stellar systems .",
    "recent studies for those systems have been given by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the fact that planets are able to exist in binary systems has been pointed out in numerous observational investigations and surveys , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "earlier work also targeted planet formation in binary systems , including terrestrial planets , as summarized by @xcite .",
    "that work contains a thorough review of our current understanding of disk  planet interactions , including prevalent processes of planet growth within gaseous protoplanetary disks , as well as the exchange of angular momentum between planets and the disk and planet migration .",
    "important results have also been provided by the _",
    "kepler _ mission , which include the detection of planets in stellar binary systems .",
    "examples include kepler-16 @xcite , and kepler-47 @xcite .",
    "kepler-16b constitutes the first circumbinary planet ( _ p_-type orbit ) , which means that it orbits both binary components .",
    "theoretical simulations on the habitability of possible earth - mass planets and moons in that system have been given by @xcite .",
    "kelper-47 , on the other hand , is host to at least three planets in orbit around both stars .",
    "a previous study focused on _ s-_type and _ p-_type habitable zones in binary systems has been given by @xcite , henceforth called paper  i. the focus of this work was the study of habitable regions for systems with the stellar components in circular orbits , a limitation that will be overcome in the present work .",
    "observationally , it is found that the stars residing in binary systems are almost always in elliptical orbits , with some systems exhibiting fairly high eccentricities ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "examples include @xmath0  cep  a ( @xmath1 ) , hd  196885  a ( @xmath2 ) , and hd  126614  a ( @xmath3 ) . in these systems ,",
    "the planet is orbiting one of the stellar components ( _ s_-type orbit ) , with the other stellar component acting as a perturbator .",
    "also , there is high diversity regarding stellar component combinations . for the cases discussed by @xcite ( see their table  2 ) , the primaries span between spectral types f , g , and k , whereas the secondaries are mostly m - type dwarfs .",
    "akin to the previous work of paper  i , numerous aspects have been taken into account , including : ( 1 ) the consideration of a joint constraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a possible system planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes (  radiative habitable zone \" ; rhz ) ; ( 2 ) the treatment of conservative , general and extended zones of habitability for the various systems as defined for the solar system and beyond ( see section  2.1 ) ; ( 3 ) the provision of a combined formalism for the assessment of both _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitability ; in particular , mathematical criteria are presented for which kind of system _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitability is realized . specifically , an algebraic formalism for the assessment of both _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitability is employed based on a fourth order polynomial . thus , an a prior specification for the presence or absence of _ s_-type or _",
    "p_-type rhzs is neither necessary nor possible , as those are determined by the adopted mathematical formalism .    in principle , five different cases of habitability are identified , which are : _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitability provided by the full extent of the rhzs ; habitability , where the rhzs are truncated by the additional constraint of planetary orbital stability ( referred to as _ st_- and _ pt_-type , respectively ) ; and cases of no habitability at all . on the other hand , paper  i solely focused on circular binary systems .",
    "fortunately , a modest modification of the method forwarded by paper  i allows for the consideration of elliptical orbits , which provide a much broader range of applicability , including detailed comparisons with observations as well as a large realm of theoretical studies .",
    "emphasis is placed again on the detailed calculations of the rhzs and the orbital stability criterion for theoretical planets , which again will utilize the previous work by @xcite , thereafter hw99 .",
    "paper  ii is structured as follows : in section  2 , we describe the theoretical approach , particularly the adopted modifications to the circular case as studied in paper  i , which concern both the computation of the rhzs and the planetary orbital stability limits . in section  3 ,",
    "we provide various case studies regarding _",
    "s- _ , _ st- _ , _ p- _ , and _",
    "pt-_type habitability .",
    "special emphasis is placed on the width of stellar habitable zones as function of the binary eccentricity as well as the domains of the conservative and general zones of habitability for different sets of system parameters .",
    "our summary and conclusions are given in section  4 .",
    "in the following , we summarize the information needed for the calculations of the rhzs in binary systems regarding both _ s_-type and _ p_-type orbits .",
    "this effort deals with the requirement of providing a habitable region for a system planet based on the radiative energy fluxes of the stellar components .",
    "the requirement of orbital stability will be disregarded for now ; it will be discussed in section  2.2 .",
    "the adopted approach is fairly similar to that of paper  i , which focused on binary systems in circular orbits .",
    "akin to paper  i , we focus on theoretical main - sequence stars ( see table  1 ) .",
    "a flow diagram of the code , named binhab , also described by @xcite , is given as figure  1 .",
    "binhab is an analytic code , and it is based on the same equations and assumptions given in paper  i and ii .",
    "the key equations of the adopted method read as follows . for a star of luminosity @xmath4 ( in units of solar luminosity @xmath5 ) , the distance @xmath6 of the habitability limit @xmath7 as identified for the sun ( see paper  i and references therein ) , constituting either an inner or outer limit of a stellar habitable region ( except for @xmath8 ; see table  2 ) , is given as @xmath9 here @xmath10 describes the stellar flux in units of the solar constant , which is a function of the stellar effective temperature @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and subsequent work ) .",
    "the values for @xmath12 are calculated following the formalism of @xcite ; see paper  i for additional information .    in the solar case , it is found that the conservative habitable zone ( chz ) extends between 0.95 and 1.37 au ( i.e. , @xmath13 and 4 , respectively ) , and the general habitable zone ( ghz ) extends between 0.84 and 1.67 au ( i.e. , @xmath14 and 5 , respectively ) ( see table  2 ) , as anticipated in the forthcoming version of binhab . ] .",
    "following @xcite and references therein , the inner limit of the chz is defined by water loss , occurring when the atmosphere is warm enough to build a stratosphere where water is gradually lost by photodissociation and subsequent hydrogen loss to space .",
    "the outer limit of the chz is defined by first carbon dioxide condensation . moreover ,",
    "the ghz is defined by the domain between the runaway greenhouse effect ( inner limit ) and the maximum greenhouse effect ( outer limit ) .",
    "the extreme case of the extended habitable zone ( ehz ) , attained through excessive planetary global greenhouse processes , is in the solar case assumed to extend up to 2.40  au @xcite , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 is used for identifying earth - equivalent positions , as done in paper  i.    in case of a binary system with planetary distances @xmath6 , limits of habitability associated with @xmath7 are obtained through solving @xmath16 it is found that    @xmath17    here @xmath18 denotes the semi - distance of the binary components ( or a modified value of it , see below , with @xmath19 being used if the original denotation applies ) , @xmath20 the distance of a position at the habitability limit contour , also referred to as radiative habitable limit ( rhl ) , and @xmath21 the associated angle ; see figure  2 for information on the coordinate set - up for both _ s_-type and _ p_-type orbits .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath22 without loss of generality . following paper  i",
    ", we again introduce the concept of recast stellar luminosity @xmath23 defined as @xmath24    finally , following algebraic transformations , the equation for @xmath25 is obtained as @xmath26 with    @xmath27    as discussed in paper  i , equation  ( 5 ) constitutes a fourth - order algebraic equation that is known to possess four possible solutions @xcite , although some ( or all ) of them may constitute unphysical solutions , i.e. , @xmath25 having a complex or imaginary value .",
    "the solutions of this polynomial allow to define the inner and outer limits of the rhzs based on the system parameters .",
    "equation  ( 5 ) is solved using the adopted coordinate system , which in essence constitutes a polar coordinate system , except that negative values for @xmath20 are permitted ; in this case the position of @xmath20 is found on the opposite side of angle @xmath21 .",
    "this approach allows to identify the various cases for the existence of solutions for @xmath25 in regard to _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitable regions .",
    "it is noteworthy that heretofore the method of solution as presented is identical to that for binary components in circular orbits .",
    "thus , the decisive question arises as to how the rhzs for binary components in elliptical orbits can adequately be addressed . in this regard ,",
    "the underlying assumption of this study needs to be taken into account , which is that _ any system planet deemed potentially habitable needs to be located within the system s rhz at all times .",
    "_ this standard needs to be applied regardless of the ( time - dependent ) separation of the binary components , i.e. , whether the system components are in a periastron @xmath28 , apastron @xmath29 , or any intermediate position .",
    "algebraically , it is found that for _ p_-type orbits , the extrema @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given as    @xmath32    whereas for _ s_-type orbits , the extrema @xmath30 and @xmath31 are given as    @xmath33    respectively , noting that @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe the areas bordered by the rhls defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the calculation of the extrema is applied to the angles @xmath38 ( _ s-_type systems ) and @xmath21 ( _ p-_type systems ) for the intervals @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . for _ p-_type systems ,",
    "the coordinate information is provided by figure  2 .",
    "note that for _ s-_type systems , the angle s fix point is at the stellar primary s1 .",
    "the necessity for the choices @xmath41 or @xmath42 is illustrated by the following instructive examples ( conveyed in high precision for tutorial reasons ) , which refer to equal - mass binary systems with @xmath43 for an eccentricity of @xmath44 ( see figure  3 ) , and with the rhls inspected for the ghz .",
    "as a first case , we consider a system assuming a major axis of @xmath45  au ; in this case , the rhz is given as _ p-_type .",
    "at the periastron position for the system components , the inner and outer limits for the rhls are given as 1.436 and 2.567  au , respectively .",
    "however , at the system s apastron position , the inner and outer limits for the rhls are given as 1.663 and 2.508  au , respectively .",
    "intermediate values for the inner and outer limits of the rhls are obtained for other positions of the system , as expected .",
    "therefore , the most stringent inner and outer limits for the overall rhz annulus are identified as 1.663 and 2.508  au , which are the values for the system s apastron position .    as a second case ,",
    "we study a system with a major axis of @xmath46  au ; in this case , the rhz is given as _",
    "s-_type ( see figure  4 ) . at the system s periastron position ,",
    "the inner and outer limits for the rhls concerning the ghz are identified as 0.9300 and 1.8443  au , respectively .",
    "furthermore , at the system s apastron position , the inner and outer limits for the rhls are identified as 0.9283 and 1.8359  au , respectively , with intermediate values for the inner and outer limits of the rhls obtained for other positions .",
    "thus , the most stringent inner and outer limits for the overall rhz annulus are identified as 0.9300 and 1.8359  au . in this case , the relevant value for the inner rhl is given by the system s periastron position , whereas relevant value for outer rhl is given by the system s apastron position .",
    "note that the same kind of behavior is identified for other sets of system parameters , such as stellar masses ( including binary systems of unequal masses ) , major axes @xmath47 , and eccentricities @xmath48 .",
    "it also holds for the different types of hzs , i.e. , chzs , ghzs , and ehzs .",
    "consequently , the most stringent positioning for the inner and outer limits of the rhzs , taking into account all possible separations of the binary components , including the periastron and apastron positions , must be taken into account .",
    "this implies that both for _ s-_type and _ p-_type habitability , for any inner rhl , the outermost position must be selected , whereas for any outer rhl , the innermost position must be selected to define the annuli for the rhzs .",
    "based on detailed analyses , exemplified by figure  3 and 4 , as well as results given in section  3 , encompassing both equal - mass and nonequal - mass binary systems , it is found that for _ s_-type rhzs , regarding inner rhls , the periastron stellar positions need to be chosen , i.e. , @xmath49 , whereas regarding outer rhls , the apastron stellar positions need to be chosen , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "however , for _ p_-type rhzs , both regarding the inner and outer rhls , the apastron positions need to be chosen throughout ( see table  2 ) .",
    "thus , in terms of the derivations obtained in paper  i , all equations still hold , except that @xmath51 needs to be replaced by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 must be set as either @xmath49 or @xmath50 , depending on the selection of @xmath54 and whether _ s_-type or _",
    "p_-type rhzs are considered ( see table  2 ) .",
    "hence , the entire previously given mathematical evaluations , including the transformations for general binary systems represented through a fourth - order polynomial , continue to hold as virtually all equations and analyses are distinctly separate for inner and outer rhls ; this feature applies to both equal - mass and non - equal mass binary systems .",
    "one decisive connection between inner and outer rhls is given by the requirement that for a _",
    "p_-type habitable region , the inner rhl @xmath55 must be located completely inside the outer rhl @xmath56 for the corresponding rhz to exist , i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the domain bordered by the respective rhls .",
    "as noted in paper  i , this condition is , however , violated in some models , especially for relatively large values of @xmath51 , as well as relatively small ratios of @xmath59 . in this case , the rhz for @xmath60 is nullified , a behavior that may occur for the pairings @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , corresponding to the chz , ghz , and ehz , respectively .",
    "as noted in previous investigations , habitability in multi - stellar systems ( including binaries ) requires  among other aspects  planetary orbital stability . in earlier work ,",
    "@xcite identified upper and lower bounds of planetary orbital stability considering the orbital elements , semimajor axis and eccentricity of the adopted binary stars . within the last thirty years",
    ", a large body of additional studies has been performed encompassing both numerical and analytical work .",
    "recent examples for the restricted three - body problem , but also containing assessments about general cases , have been given by @xcite .",
    "previously , hw99 derived fitting formulae of orbital stability limits for both _ s_-type and _ p_-type planets in binary systems given as @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "these equations communicate the critical semimajor axis @xmath66 in units of the semimajor axis @xmath51 in the cases of _ s_-type and _ p_-type orbits . for _",
    "s_-type orbits , the ratio @xmath67 , see equation  ( 10 ) , conveys the _ upper limit _ of planetary orbital stability , whereas for _ p_-type orbits , the ratio @xmath67 , see equation  ( 11 ) , conveys the _ lower limit _ of planetary orbital stability . here",
    "@xmath68 denotes the stellar mass ratio , given as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 describe the two masses of the binary components with @xmath72 .",
    "the above given equations also include the parameter functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which depend on the mass ratio @xmath68 and the eccentricity of the stellar binary , @xmath48 , and are non - zero for elliptical binary systems for the sake of parallelism between the treatment of _ s_-type and _ p_-type orbits . ] .    following hw99 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given as @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively ( see table  3 for details ) .",
    "equations  ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) constitute second - order polynomial fits on results of orbital stability simulations by hw99 and previous work .",
    "the underlying studies explore the survival times of theoretical planets , treated as test particles , in various binary systems .",
    "furthermore , based on hw99 s work , the equations  ( 10 ) to ( 13 ) are invalid for eccentricities beyond 0.8 . therefore , we limit the scope of the present study to binary systems with eccentricities in the range of @xmath79 .",
    "next we highlight the general impact of the eccentricity of a binary system on the different types of habitable regions through exemplifying the effects of eccentricity on systems through two cases , which are : a case of high eccentricity ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) and the circular case ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) .",
    "first , we consider the impact of the binary system eccentricity on the rhzs .",
    "examples are given in figure  5 , which depicts systems of stellar masses of @xmath43 , as well as of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , taking the ghz as test cases .",
    "( the aspect that nonequal - mass binary systems compared to equal - mass binary systems , with @xmath84 kept constant , have largely reduced rhzs , albeit @xmath85 of the nonequal - mass system is notably higher due to the mass  luminosity relationship , has been one of the main foci of paper  i. ) the major axis is assumed as @xmath86  au ; furthermore , we consider binary eccentricities of @xmath87 and 0.5 . in case of equal masses and",
    "@xmath87 the inner and outer rhls are given as 1.54 and 2.54  au , respectively .",
    "for @xmath80 , however , the inner and outer rhls are given as 1.75 and 2.11  au , respectively .",
    "thus , if @xmath48 is increased , the inner rhl moves outward , whereas the outer rhl moves inward .",
    "therefore , the total width of the rhz is reduced from 1.0  au to 0.36  au .    an even more dramatic reduction of",
    "the rhz occurs for unequal mass systems .",
    "taking @xmath82 and @xmath83 as an example , it is found that for @xmath81 , the inner and outer rhls are given as 2.16 and 2.66  au , respectively . for @xmath80 , the inner and outer rhls",
    "are given as 2.41 and 2.45  au , respectively .",
    "in this case , the rhz is virtually nonexistent ; its width has been reduced by 91% relative to the circular case , whereas in the equal - mass system previously discussed , the reduction is  only \" 64% .",
    "note that reductions in the rhzs also occur for _ s_-type habitable regions .",
    "however , for those models , the effects of increased values for @xmath48 are very small , or minuscule , as verified by numerous case studies ( see section  3.3 ) . for the above - given examples of @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath88  au , the rhzs",
    "are marginally reduced both for the equal and non - equal mass system , noting that the reduction relative to the circular case are given as 0.8% and 0.04% , respectively .",
    "another important aspect concerns the influence of @xmath48 on the orbital stability behavior of possible planets .",
    "generally , it is found that if @xmath48 is increased , the domain of stability is reduced both for _ s_-type and _ p_-type orbits .",
    "if @xmath48 is larger than zero , the orbital stability limit for _ p_-type orbits ( which constitutes a lower limit ) is positioned further outward , whereas for _ s_-type orbits , the orbital stability limit ( which constitutes an upper limit ) is positioned further inward .",
    "evidently , both types of behavior affect the domains of planetary orbital stability in an adverse manner . to showcase this type of behavior , we evaluated both @xmath76 and @xmath75 for different values of @xmath48 , given as 0.0 , 0.3 , and 0.5 . for @xmath89 , @xmath76",
    "is identified as 2.31 , 3.35 , and 3.85 , respectively , corresponding to an increase by a factor of 1.67 . for @xmath90 , @xmath76",
    "is identified as 2.39 , 3.18 , and 3.60 , respectively , corresponding to an increase by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "it is found that the orbital stability limit moves outward if @xmath48 is increased , thus reducing the width of the rhz ( if any ) compatible with planetary orbital stability . for _ s_-type habitability , the following results are found . for @xmath89 , @xmath75",
    "is obtained as 0.369 , 0.233 , and 0.152 , and for @xmath90 , @xmath75 is obtained as 0.274 , 0.177 , and 0.118 , respectively , for the sequence of @xmath87 , 0.3 , and 0.5 ( see above ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath89 and 0.50 , @xmath75 is reduced by a factor of about 2.4 if @xmath48 is raised from 0.0 to 0.5 . as for _",
    "s_-type orbits , the planetary orbital stability limit constitutes an upper limit , which is found to be placed further inward for systems of higher binary eccentricity ; thus , the width of the rhz ( if any ) compatible with planetary orbital stability is reduced as well .",
    "in summary , increased values of eccentricity in binary systems entail an adverse impact both regarding _ p_-type and _ s_-type habitability , due to their influence both on the widths of the rhzs ( if any ) and on the domains of stability for possible circumbinary or circumstellar planets .",
    "in the following , we study examples of _ s- _ , _ st- _ , _ p- _ , and _",
    "pt-_type habitability aimed at highlighting the impact of binary eccentricity .",
    "our study comprises an equal - mass system of @xmath91 with a luminosity of @xmath92 ( see figure  6 ) and a nonequal - mass system of @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( see figure  7 ) ; here the luminosities are given as @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the habitable regions are calculated for the ghz .",
    "the overall approach is to place the two stellar components at different separation distances , i.e. , with the major axis @xmath47 considered the independent variable , and to assess resulting domains of habitability .",
    "the systems are evaluated for fixed values of binary eccentricity , given as @xmath97 , 0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.75 , respectively .",
    "regarding _ p-_type orbits , it is found that increased values of binary eccentricity affect the widths of the rhzs as well as the maximum value of the major axis @xmath47 , for which _ p-_type rhzs can exist .",
    "this type of behavior is found for both the equal - mass and the nonequal - mass system .",
    "for the equal - mass binary system ( see figure  6 ) , the width of the rhz at 0.05  au ( a distance where also the orbital stability criterion is readily met ) is given as 1.20 , 1.16 , 1.11 , and 1.06  au for models of @xmath97 , 0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.75 , respectively .",
    "for the nonequal - mass binary system ( see figure  7 ) , the width of the rhz at 0.05  au is identified as 0.91 , 0.82 , 0.74 , and 0.67  au , respectively .",
    "these results show that higher values of @xmath48 entail smaller widths of the rhz and that for given values of @xmath48 , the width of the rhz is noticeably smaller in the nonequal - mass system than in the equal - mass system , even though the latter has a higher combined stellar luminosity ( @xmath85 ) .    regarding the orbital stability limit , which for _ p-_type orbits constitutes a lower limit ( see section  2.2 ) ,",
    "the following behavior is found : if the major axis of the stellar components is increased , the limit moves inward , which is found for both the equal - mass and the nonequal - mass system ( see figure 6 and 7 , respectively ) .",
    "therefore , the stellar separation distance must be relatively small for the full width of the rhz to be available for _ p-_type habitability . for models of increased values of @xmath48 , the requirement of stellar proximity",
    "becomes more rigorous ; not that this more - stringent requirement corresponds to a larger slope of the orbital stability cut - off line . in the eight examples given in figures  6 and 7 , there are also domains of _ pt_-type habitability , i.e. , where some , but not all , of the _ p-_type rhz is available for circumbinary habitability ; however , they are relatively small , if not minuscule .",
    "thus , in other words , irrespective of the system s eccentricity , for small binary separation distances @xmath47 , the habitable region is mostly characterized as _ p-_type instead of _",
    "pt_-type , because the full width of the rhz is available for providing habitability .    _",
    "s-_type rhzs are also influenced by the eccentricity of the binary system , though the effects are relatively minor .",
    "for binary systems with a major axis of @xmath98  au , the following behavior occurs . for the equal - mass system of figure  6 , rhz@xmath99 changes from 0.930 to 0.985  au , and rhz@xmath100 changes from 1.843 to 1.836  au if the system s eccentricity is increased from 0.0 to 0.75 .",
    "furthermore , for the nonequal - mass system of figure  7 , rhz@xmath99 changes from 1.209 to 1.234  au , and rhz@xmath100 changes from 2.341 to 2.338  au if the system s eccentricity is increased from 0.0 to 0.75 .",
    "hence , the width of the rhz for the equal - mass system decreases from 0.91 to 0.85  au , whereas the width of the rhz for the nonequal - mass system decreases from 1.13 to 1.10  au between the circular case and @xmath101 .",
    "thus , increased values of eccentricity reduce the width of the rhzs for _ s-_type systems as well .",
    "however , it is also found that the width of the rhz in the nonequal - mass binary system is consistently higher than in the equal - mass binary system owing to the influence of @xmath102 .",
    "regarding the orbital stability limit , which for _ s-_type orbits constitutes an upper limit ( see section  2.2 ) , the following behavior is identified : if the major axis of the stellar components is increased , the orbital stability limit moves outward .",
    "therefore , the stellar separation distance must be relatively large for the full width of the rhz to be available for _ s-_type habitability . for models of increased values of @xmath48 , the requirement of a sufficiently large stellar separation distance",
    "is highly rigorous ; _ s-_type habitability is only available for relatively large @xmath47 values . in figures  6 and 7 , the more - stringent requirement of orbital stability for larger values of @xmath48 amounts to a decrease in the slope of the orbital stability cut - off line .    the effect of the system s eccentricity on its ability to provide _",
    "s-_type habitable regions is remarkable . for @xmath48 of 0.0 , 0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.75 , _",
    "s-_type habitability occurs at minimum major axes of 13.5 , 19.1 , 31.1 , and 74.5  au , respectively , for the equal - mass system ( see figure  6 ) and at 14.8 , 21.2 , 35.1 , and 84.9  au , respectively , for the nonequal - mass system ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "higher values of the system s eccentricity also imply larger domains of _ st-_type habitability , i.e. , domains where not the full width of the _ s-_type rhz constitutes a possible region of circumstellar habitability .",
    "if @xmath48 is increased from 0.0 to 0.5 or 0.75 , the domains of _ st-_type habitability change from 6.6 to 15.2 or 36.5  au for the equal - mass system and from 7.2 to 16.9 or 41.0  au for the nonequal - mass system .",
    "the reason for this pattern is that in systems of high eccentricity , the stars are in relatively close proximity at their periastron positions , which reduces both the _ s-_type and _ st-_type habitable regions due to the orbital stability requirement .",
    "considering major axes of @xmath98  au for the four equal - mass systems as well as the four nonequal - mass systems studied here , _",
    "s-_type and _ st-_type habitability are found for one system each , whereas the case of no habitable region is encoutered for two systems each .    in summary , it is found that increased values of binary eccentricity affect the rhzs ( though the change in _ s_-type rhzs is very minor ) and pose a highly unfavorable impact on the domains of orbital stability for possible system planet .",
    "these findings apply to both _ s-_type and _ p-_type habitability .",
    "moreover , higher values of binary eccentricity also entail larger domains of @xmath47 , where neither _ s_/_st-_type nor _ p_/_pt-_type habitable regions exist .",
    "additional case studies for _ s-_type and _ p-_type systems are given in section  3.3 and 3.2 , respectively .",

    "owing to the many possible sets of parameter combinations , encompassing the stellar major axis @xmath47 , the binary eccentricity @xmath48 , and the stellar masses @xmath70 and @xmath71 , it will not be feasible to provide a fully comprehensive analysis .",
    "however , it will be possible to focus on various cases , selected for tutorial purposes , by using @xmath104 , 0.75 , and 1.0  au .",

    "akin to paper  i , we concentrate on systems of main - sequence stars ; see table  1 for information on the stellar parameters .",
    "one of our goals is to inspect the values for rhz@xmath99 and rhz@xmath100 at the stellar periastron and apastron position , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , to obtain additional data to justify the method adopted for calculating the rhzs ( see section  2.1 ) .",
    "we also include systems of low - mass / low - luminosity stars , corresponding to stellar types k and m , which is motivated by their relatively high abundance ( i.e. , up to about 90% ) , owing to the skewness of the galactic initial mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "data are given for both the rhz ( see column  orbit \" ) and the orbital stability limited denoted as @xmath66 .",
    "it is found that for both the chz and ghz , the rhz@xmath99 and rhz@xmath100 significantly depend on the system s eccentricity @xmath48 with @xmath47 assumed to be fixed . specifically , rhz@xmath99 increases and rhz@xmath100 decreases as functions of @xmath48 .",
    "hence , for any system with a prescribed value for @xmath47 , the rhzs narrow if @xmath48 is increased .    for the chz ( table  4 ) , the width of the rhz between @xmath87 and 0.8 changes from 0.56 to 0.41  au in systems of @xmath106  au and from 0.48 to 0.18 in systems of @xmath107  au . for @xmath86",

    "another approach to demonstrate the impact of the binary eccentricity @xmath48 on the domains of _ p_/_pt-_type habitability is to evaluate the quantities % rhz and % hz for the various models .",

    "no habitable region exists .",
    "figure  9 and table  11 allow for the identification of general properties of systems with different combinations of masses and , by implication , luminosities of the stellar components .",
    "the findings include that in models of low eccentricity , i.e. , @xmath123 , the widths of the hzs are largely determined by the luminosity of the stellar primary , which means that the higher its luminosity the larger is the resulting hz .",
    "this result is valid for the chz , ghz , as well as the ehz . in the absence of truncation imposed by the orbital stability limit , the widths for the ehzs are largest and the widths for the ghzs and chzs are respectively smaller , as expected .",
    "the width of the _ s_-type habitable region is largest for systems where the stellar primary possesses the greatest luminosity .",
    "however , these systems are also characterized by relatively low critical values of @xmath48 owing to highly efficient truncation of the rhz due to the orbital stability limit because of the primary s relatively high mass .",
    "conversely , for systems of low luminosity , relatively high numbers for the critical value of @xmath48 are obtained . even though the _ s_/_st_-type habitable zones have small widths in most of those systems , habitability is still possible for systems of high eccentricity .",

    "regarding the 18 models for the equal - mass binary of @xmath125 , obtained with respect to the chz and ghz , it is found that for 10 models , the reduction in the rhz is less than 1% , and for 14 models , it is less than 2%",
    ". nevertheless , for relatively high values of @xmath48 , the reduction in the % hz is highly notable due to the impact of the orbital stability constraint .    regarding the 18 models for the nonequal - mass binary system given as @xmath93 and @xmath94 ,",
    "the following behavior was identified . here",
    "the reduction of the rhz is even less significant than in the equal - mass system previously discussed .",
    "in fact , regarding the 18 models considered , the rhz is reduced by 1% or less in 15 models , and by 2% or less in 17 models .",
    "this result is due to the the lower luminosity of the secondary star compared to the previous system .",
    "however , the impact of the orbital stability constraint in the nonequal - mass system is much more severe than in the equal - mass system previously discussed , as communicated by the numerical values of % hz . regarding the chz and ghz , habitable regions are rendered impossible for eccentricities beyond 0.49 and 0.54 , respectively ( see table  11 ) .    finally , we also compared systems of different major axes , specifically @xmath98  au and @xmath88  au .",
    "it was found that the widths of the hzs , especially for models of low eccentricity , were largely unaffected by the value of binary major axis ; however , the critical values of @xmath48 were still influenced by the choice of the major axis .",
    "these results are also consistent with the analysis of figures  6 and 7 ( see section  3.1 ) , which consider systems of different major axes @xmath47 . in those systems ,",
    "the _ s-_type rhzs were found to be largely independent of the values of the major axes ; however , in systems of high eccentricity , habitability has been highly restricted or nullified due to the planetary orbital stability requirement .",
    "the method as described allows the calculation of _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitable zones in stellar binary systems .",
    "_ p_-type orbits occur when the planet orbits both binary components , whereas in the case of _ s_-type orbits , the planet orbits only one of the binary components with the second component considered a perturbator .",
    "the selected approach considers a variety of aspects including : ( 1 ) besides simple cases , the treatment of nonequal - mass systems and systems in elliptical orbits ; this latter aspect is a significant augmentation of the methodology given in paper  i ; ( 2 ) the consideration of a joint constraint , including orbital stability and a habitable region for a possible system planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes ; ( 3 ) the provision of a combined formalism for the assessment of both _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitability ; in particular , through the solution of a fourth - order polynomial , mathematical criteria are employed for the kind of system in which _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitability is realized , an approach in alignment with that of paper  i.    if the rhzs are truncated by the additional constraint of orbital stability , the notation of _ st_-type and _ pt_-type habitability is used . in comparison to the circular case , it is found that in systems of higher eccentricity , the domains of the rhzs are significantly reduced .",
    "furthermore , the orbital stability constraint also impacts _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitability , in an unfavorable manner ; this latter aspect is particularly relevant to the overall context of astrobiology . nonetheless , _",
    "st_- , and _",
    "pt_-type habitability is identified for a considerable set of system parameters .",
    "compared to paper  i , which was focused on the circular case , a modest modification of the method allows for the consideration of elliptical orbits , entailing a significantly augmented range of applicability for the proposed method .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to present a comprehensive parameter study . besides the choice of the appropriate type of hz , the system parameters for standard main - sequence stars ( see table  1 ) pertaining to our model include the major axis @xmath47 , the eccentricity of the binary components @xmath48 , and the stellar luminosities @xmath102 and @xmath103 , or alternatively , the stellar masses @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . in the case of general stars ,",
    "include subgiants and giants , the set of parameters would be further enlarged due to the lack of a universal mass  luminosity relationship .",
    "selected results for low - mass main - sequence star binary systems have previously been given by @xcite .",
    "it is found that an increased value for the eccentricity in stellar binary systems results in an adverse influence both regarding the rhzs and the orbital stability of possible system planets .",
    "for the latter , it is found that for _ p_-type habitability , the limits of orbital stability move inward , and for _ s_-type habitability , the limits of orbital stability move outward , thus potentially reducing the size of habitable regions for , respectively , circumbinary and circumstellar planets . restrictions due to the orbital stability criterion are especially significant for _ s_-type habitability for systems in highly elliptical orbits , since at the periastron position large segments of the rhzs are nullified .",
    "however , restrictions due to limited orbital stability in systems of highly elliptical orbits are less relevant regarding _ p_-type habitability ; in this case the most influential factor is given by the distribution of luminosity between the stellar components .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , highly unequal distributions of luminosity often entail small or nonexisting rhzs .",
    "our studies also show that increased eccentricities for the stellar binary components lead to smaller widths of the hzs , as well as the lack of existence of hzs for relatively large values of @xmath48 . in order to nonetheless offer some degree of habitability for systems in notably eccentric orbits , the finding places extra weight on previous studies , which show that under distinct conditions ( e.g. , relatively thick planetary atmospheres , distinct types of planetary atmospheric compositions ) exoplanets are able to leave the rhzs without forfeiting habitability .",
    "for example , @xcite argued  based on 3-d general - circulation climate models and 1-d energy balance models aimed at examining earth - type planets on extremely elliptical orbits near the hz ",
    "exoplanets , as well as exomoons hosted by jupiter - type planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will be able to harbor life even when undergoing excursions beyond the hz .",
    "the reason is that in the framework of their models , long - term climate stability depends primarily on the average stellar flux received over an entire orbit , rather than the length of time spent within the hz .",
    "as previously discussed , a second criterion  besides the existence of the rhzs  for facilitating habitability consists in the orbital stability requirement .",
    "this criterion has heightened relevance compared to the radiative criterion because evidently ",
    "there is no way of escaping gravity \" as due to system conditions , gravity - imposed planetary orbital instabilities may occur .",
    "our present study employs the stability limits given by @xcite .",
    "they are based on numerical simulations for test particles able to survive @xmath126 binary orbits .",
    "considering the need for detailed habitability studies based on timescales of up to several billions of years , as implied by terrestrial biology , it appears appropriate to update the previous work of @xcite based on significantly elongated timescales .",
    "an expected outcome of this type of investigation will be updated stability limits for both _ p_-type and _ s_-type orbits , which will likely be more stringent than currently attained .    based on existing studies and tools given in the literature",
    ", future studies should include : ( 1 ) how limits of habitability ( i.e. , @xmath7 ; see section  2.1 ) depend on the properties of the planet itself , such as planetary atmosphere , geodynamics , rotation rate , and mass ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , ( 2 ) models of binary systems where the component undergoes significant time - dependent evolution , and ( 3 ) models where the orbit of the terrestrial planet is misaligned with the orbital plane of the stellar binary components .",
    "this latter aspect is motivated by ongoing discoveries , including the detection of misaligned protoplanetary disks in the young binary system hk tauri @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is found that the disks are misaligned by 60@xmath127 to 68@xmath127 , such that one or both of the disks are significantly inclined to the binary orbital plane .",
    "any future system planet will thus most likely result in a highly eccentric as well as inclined orbit .",
    "such outcomes will pose a serious challenge to the calculation of both rhzs and orbital stability limits needed for future investigation of _",

    "<S> in the first paper of this series , a comprehensive approach has been provided for the study of _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitable regions in stellar binary systems , which was , however , restricted to circular orbits of the stellar components . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , a modest modification of the method also allows for the consideration of elliptical orbits , which of course entails a much broader range of applicability . </S>",
    "<S> this augmented method is presented here , and numerous applications are conveyed . in alignment with paper  </S>",
    "<S> i , the selected approach considers a variety of aspects , which comprise the consideration of a joint constraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a possible system planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes (  radiative habitable zone \" ; rhz ) . </S>",
    "<S> the devised method is based on a combined formalism for the assessment of both _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitability ; in particular , mathematical criteria are deduced for which kinds of systems _ s_-type and _ p_-type habitable zones are realized . </S>",
    "<S> if the rhzs are truncated by the additional constraint of orbital stability , the notation of _ st_-type and _ pt_-type habitability applies . in comparison to the circular case </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that in systems of higher eccentricity , the range of the rhzs is significantly reduced . </S>",
