    "the kondo effect , found originally for systems with magnetic impurities in metals is now present in a variety of nanoscopic systems , including semiconducting quantum dots @xcite , magnetic adatoms on surfaces @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite . in the latter , in addition to the spin kramers degeneracy ,",
    "there is in addition orbital degeneracy due to the `` pseudospin '' degree of freedom related with the particular band structure of graphene .",
    "this leads to an su(4 ) kondo effect which has been observed experimentally @xcite and also discussed theoretically @xcite .",
    "in particular , lim _",
    "et al . _ have studied the spectral density when the su(4 ) symmetry is reduced to su(2 ) , mainly by a change in the tunneling matrix elements @xcite .",
    "our main motivation in the problem arises from interference phenomena in systems of quantum dots @xcite or molecules @xcite .",
    "for example depressions in the integrated conductance through a ring described by the hubbard or @xmath4 model , pierced by an aharonov - bohm magnetic flux , related with spin - charge separation @xcite , are due to a partial destructive interference when the energy of two doublets cross @xcite .",
    "similar interference effects were predicted in molecular transistors @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian near the crossing is discussed in the next section .    to our knowlege",
    ", the conductance in these systems has so far been calculated using approximate expressions or a slave - boson formalism @xcite , which is valid only for very low temperatures and applied bias voltages .",
    "this work is a step towards a more quantitative theory to describe the transport through similar systems , treating the effective hamiltonian within the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) @xcite .",
    "work is in progress to deal with the non - equilibrium situation , which is necessary within our formalism to calculate the current .    in this paper",
    ", we report on our study of the spectral density of the model as a function of the splitting @xmath5 between both doublets in the kondo regime .",
    "we also calculate the dependence of the kondo temperature @xmath6 with @xmath5 and analyze the validity of the friedel sum rule @xcite .",
    "we start from a model in which two doublets of an interacting system are hybridized with a singlet by promotion of an electron to two conducting leads .",
    "this is the low - energy effective hamiltonian for several systems with partial destructive interference , such as aharonov - bohm rings @xcite or aromatic molecules @xcite connected to conducting leads .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xcite    @xmath7    where the singlet @xmath8 and the two doublets @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ; @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) denote the localized states ( representing for example the low - energy states of an isolated molecule ) , @xmath13 create conduction states in the left ( @xmath14 ) or right ( @xmath15 ) lead , and @xmath16 describe the four hopping elements between the two leads and both doublets , assumed independent of @xmath17 .    changing the phase of the conduction states and the relative phase between both doublets , three among the four @xmath16 can be made real and positive .",
    "the phase @xmath18 of the remaining hopping @xmath19 , depends on the particular system and its symmetry .",
    "for example in molecules with rotational symmetry @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the distance between the sites connected to the left and right leads , and @xmath22 is the wave vector of the state @xmath23 , which can be modified with an applied magnetic flux @xcite . in absence of magnetic flux and when the relevant states have wave vector @xmath24 , as in rings with a number of atoms multiple of four , @xmath25 and there is complete destructive interference in transport @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will assume this case , with states 1 and 2 related by symmetry implying @xmath26 .",
    "we  further assume symmetric leads , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "then , without loss of generality we can take @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .    for these parameters ,",
    "changing basis @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the hamiltonian takes the form of an su(4 ) anderson model with a `` field '' @xmath34 and on - site hybridization @xmath35    @xmath36    interchanging the doublet index ( 1 or 2 ) with the spin index @xmath37 , one realizes that this model also describes transport trough a carbon nanotube with electron density depleated at two points ( so as to created an su(4 ) quantum dot in the middle ) under a real applied magnetic field .",

    "we set @xmath45 as the unit of energy .",
    "we also assume a conduction band symmetric around the fermi level @xmath46 of half width @xmath38 .",
    "the spectral density shows a broad charge transfer peak near @xmath47 . for temperatures below a characteristic energy scale @xmath3 ( defined below )",
    ", @xmath41 develops a narrow peak around the fermi level .",
    "in contrast to the better known one - level su(2 ) case , this peak is displaced towards positive energies and is much broader , as discussed in section 5 .     and @xmath48 .",

    "the peak near the fermi energy of @xmath52 is displaced towards positive energies ( near @xmath53 ) .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding peak in @xmath54 narrows significantly and displaces towards the fermi energy .",
    "this implies that the kondo temperature @xmath3 defined as the half width at half maximum of this peak , also decreases strongly .",
    "the evolution of @xmath3 with @xmath0 is discussed in the section 5 .",
    "in addition @xmath55 develops a broad peak near energy @xmath56 which becomes visible when @xmath0 becomes greater than @xmath3 .",
    "the anderson model studied has a fermi liquid ground state which satisfies well known relationships at zero temperature .",
    "one of them is the friedel sum rule which relates the spectral density at the fermi level for each `` pseudospin '' channel with the occupation of that channel @xcite . for the simplest case of a constant density of conduction states ,",
    "this rule reads    @xmath57    where @xmath58 .",
    "this is an exact relationship for a fermi liquid , which is not necessarily satisfied by approximations . in particular , it is known that at very low temperatures , the nca has a tendency to develop spurious spikes in @xmath59 at the fermi energy , while thermodynamic properties , such as expectation values are accurately reproduced @xcite .    in fig .",

    "the disagreement lies below 20 % .",
    "the agreement improves as the parameters are moved deeper in the kondo regime @xmath62 .",
    "thus , while the spectral density at zero temperature is not well represented by the nca results at @xmath63 , one can take the values at @xmath60 as a reasonable description of the correct @xmath63 ones .",

    "from the half width at half maximum of the peak nearest to the fermi energy of the spectral density of the lowest level ( @xmath54 ) , we have calculated the kondo temperature of the system @xmath6 for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "this requires to solve the self - consistent nca equations up to low enough temperatures ( about 0.1 @xmath3 as discussed above ) so that the height of the peak does not increase significantly with further lowering of the temperature @xcite .",
