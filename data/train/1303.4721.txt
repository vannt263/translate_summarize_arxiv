    "new attosecond x - ray table top sources@xcite and the x - ray free electron lasers ( xfel ) @xcite allow to extend nonlinear spectroscopic techniques , originally developed to study valence excitonic systems , to molecular core excitations .",
    "xfel sources are bright enough to saturate the core - excitation transitions , @xcite and should enable fundamental questions about the quasiparticle description of many - electron states to be experimentally addressed .",
    "nonlinear techniques designed to probe quantum correlations in systems at lower energies with slower dynamics may thus be extended to the x - ray frequency regime .",
    "the core electrons are tightly bound to specific atoms and are strongly coupled to a slower bath of correlated valence electrons shared between atoms .",
    "1d- and 2d- stimulated x - ray raman techniques have been proposed to examine valence electron dynamics using core - holes as ultrafast switches .",
    "this paper focuses on doubly core - excited states ( dcess ) , in which the main players are the static core holes and the virtual orbitals .",
    "these states correspond to the high - energy limit of double valence excitations , which are challenging to treat with density functional theory ( dft ) methods.@xcite multiply excited states can be prepared by short and intense laser pulses.@xcite it has been suggested that dcess carry information about the chemical environment of a selected atom in double photoionization core - excitation spectroscopy.@xcite recent experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite work demonstrated a static frequency shift of doubly - core - photoionized states that depend on their local chemical environment .",
    "the double - quantum - coherence ( dqc ) signal@xcite preferentially targets doubly excited states in an excitonic system.@xcite this signal strongly depends on the coupling between excitons ; infrared dqc signals , which have been used to study vibrational couplings in the amide i band,@xcite sensitively depend on anharmonicities , vanishing for harmonic vibrational systems . in the visible",
    ", dqc has been used to investigate the excitations of a dye molecule in ethanol,@xcite and theoretical studies have demonstrated a strong dependence on electron correlations in model two and three - level semiconductor systems @xcite . it can monitor the breakdown of mean - field theories of electron correlation in molecular systems .",
    "this technique has also been applied to measure spin selected biexciton coupling using circularly polarized pulses @xcite , and interatomic couplings in a dilute potassium vapor@xcite .",
    "the x - ray version of this technique ( xdqc ) is sensitive to correlation and exciton scattering in dcess , making it an attractive experimental test for many - body electron structure techniques for strongly correlated systems .",
    "@xcite xdqc detects only systems in which the singly core excitations affect each other and the doubly core - excited wavefunction may not be factorized into an outer product of two singly core - excited wavefunctions . for uncoupled core excitations , two contributions to the signal ( see sec .",

    "incomplete cancellation therefore provides a sensitive measure of correlation between core excitations .",
    "core - excited states can be calculated at various levels of theory .",
    "the xdqc signal was first simulated for all nitrogen excitations of isomers of aminophenol with a simple equivalent core approximation ( eca ) describes the effect of the core hole on the valence excited states.@xcite in this study we employ restricted excitation window time - dependent density functional theory ( rew - tddft),@xcite a response formalism that incorporates the core hole valence coupling through an exchange - correlation functional .",
    "this approach was recently used to calculate the single core excitations and two dimensional stimulated x - ray raman signal of cysteine.@xcite    here we simulate the xdqc signals of formamide , a small organic molecule containing carbon , nitrogen and oxygen , which is often used as a model for the peptide backbone in proteins ( see fig .

    "electronic excited states can often be represented as linear combinations of single excitations , where a single electron is promoted from an occupied to a virtual orbital .",
    "some of the most popular and inexpensive computational methods for excited states , such as configuration interaction singles ( cis ) and time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) , are based on this picture . while often adequate for molecules or high bandgap materials they fail badly for double excitations in conjugated or metallic systems with strong valence band correlations .",
    "double - exciton states , which are common in molecular crystals@xcite and materials with strong spatial localization,@xcite also play a role in conical intersections , long - range charge - transfer excitations and autoionizing resonances.@xcite low - lying excited states in polyenes with significant double excitation character are notable examples in which the single excitation picture fails qualitatively to describe the system.@xcite strong double - excitation features in x - ray absorption near edge structure ( xanes ) spectroscopy have been reported for ferrocene and ferrocenium compounds,@xcite and it has been shown that double or higher order excited configurations are necessary to construct the spin - symmetry - adapted wave - functions of molecules with open - shell ground states.@xcite    formally any state with energy close to the sum of two single excitation energies can be considered a double excitation .",
    "however this may not be always justified .",
    "the doubly excited states in polyenes mentioned above are examples where this assignment completely breaks down , since they are lower in energy than any single excited state.@xcite to define double excitations , we must first specify the reference single - particle theory and define the orbitals and their energies . in some cases",
    "a hartree - fock ground state reference suggests a significant double excitation character for an excited state while a kohn - sham ground state reference does not.@xcite various high - level _ ab initio _ methods also show very different double excitation character,@xcite since dcess are directly related to correlation .",
    "the xdqc technique creates dcess by using two pulses .",
    "in contrast with valence shake - up excitations in xanes induced by the core hole coulomb interaction , in two photon core excitation each core is prepared by a different photon . in this paper",
    "we consider the valence relaxation in the field of the first core hole explicitly , and neglect any accompanying auger , nuclear or electronic processes within the very short duration of the measurement .",
    "high - level _ ab initio _ techniques are usually required to handle double excitations in valence band excitations.@xcite these include complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) , complete active space perturbation theory of second order ( caspt2),@xcite coupled cluster ( cc),@xcite multireference configuration interaction ( mrci),@xcite symmetry - adapted cluster configuration interaction ( sac - ci),@xcite algebraic diagrammatic construction ( adc)@xcite and multireference mller - plesset perturbation theory ( mrmp)@xcite .",

    "maitra and coworkers@xcite showed that a frequency - dependent xc kernel is necessary to correctly describe a state with a strong double excitation mixing .",

    "dressed tddft@xcite to remedy this deficiency ; deriving a frequency - dependent xc kernel in which single excitations are mixed with spectrally isolated double excitations .",
    "this approach has been applied and tested.@xcite its major weakness is the need to assign the mixed single and double excitations _ a priori_.    many additional density functional methods have been proposed for doubly - excited systems .",
    "casida had added non - dft many - body polarization propagator correction based on the bethe - salpeter equation to the xc kernel.@xcite this nonadiabatic xc kernel includes the dressed tddft kernel as a special case if the ground state has a closed shell .",
    "additional frequency - dependent xc kernels accounting for double excitations in finite and correlated systems were derived recently from the bethe - salpeter equation.@xcite the spin - flip ( sf ) approach@xcite is also a promising method for generating double excited states from a triplet single reference state , in which electrons are excited to an orbital with a different spin .",
    "the sf approach can be employed to both wave - function-@xcite and tddft@xcite based methods . in the original implementation of sf - tddft , the coupling of sf excitations entered the linear response equation only through the hartree - fock exchange component in the hybrid xc functionals .",
    "wang and ziegler overcame this limitation by a noncollinear formulation of the xc potential.@xcite recent assessment and applications of sf - tddft are given in refs . .",
    "the real - time approach has also been used to obtain double excitations.@xcite a time - independent dft method for multiple excitations was proposed recently.@xcite in this approach multiple excited states were obtained from an optimized effective potential ( oep ) eigenvalue equation with orthogonality constraints .",
    "computing of the oep of a polyatomic molecule , however , is not easy , and there are still many open questions in the dft response formalism for excited states .",
    "time - dependent density matrix functional theory ( tddmft ) , proposed by giesbertz et al.,@xcite may also account for double excitations . adopting these methods to better describe the processes that contribute to various nonlinear spectroscopy techniques , and design experiments which test the assumptions underlying them ,",
    "is an ongoing open challenge .",
    "the three most common approximate descriptions of core excitations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ch ] .",
    "the equivalent core hole approximation ( eca ) , also known as the @xmath0 approximation,@xcite replaces the core hole by an additional nuclear charge , and was employed in our previous simulation studies of x - ray nonlinear spectroscopy signals .",
    "@xcite the eca can be easily implemented within the routine features of standard quantum chemistry packages , and easily represents dcess using an extra two nuclear charges .",
    "however , it is only applicable to deep core - holes as it neglects the effect of the chemical environment , changes the spin symmetry of a single core hole state @xcite and can not account for core hole delocalization and migration .",
    "the full core hole ( fch ) approximation @xcite improves on the basic eca model by employing orbitals determined self - consistently using the fixed core hole configuration as shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ch ] .",
    "the direct static exchange ( stex ) model @xcite is one type of fch with the occupied hartree - fock orbitals and the improved virtual orbitals ( ivo)@xcite of the ionic ( @xmath1)-electron system . unlike the eca ,",
    "stex includes orbital relaxation and can be applied to both deep and shallow core - holes .",
    "interactions between the excited electron and the other @xmath1 inner electrons , however are still neglected .",
    "we have used stex to study linear and nonlinear x - ray spectroscopy signals @xcite in small organic molecules .",
    "a detailed analysis of stex and comparison with rew - tddft is given in refs . and .",
    "current implementations of stex are limited to single core hole states .",
    "spin coupling of the two core electrons complicates the dces wave - function , making it hard to map to an effective single particle hamiltonian like that in stex .",
    "self - consistent field ( scf ) calculations of dcess are also numerically tricky , and frequently fail to converge .",
    "previous calculations of double core hole states using casscf , @xcite mrci , and adc @xcite are expensive and had only been applied to small molecules such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "relativistic corrections may be necessary for core",
    "electrons.@xcite the much cheaper @xmath4scf method , @xcite like stex , suffers from the scf convergence problem for core hole states @xcite .",
    "moreover , running many scf calculations with combinations of core - holes and excited electrons is tedious .",
    "we employ a third approach , rew - tddft , first proposed by stener et al . in 2003@xcite and further developed in additional studies.@xcite rew - tddft only considers electrons excited from a defined set of relevant orbitals ( the restricted excitation window ) , allowing to obtain high - lying states in the excitation spectrum without calculating the lower states .",
    "a similar restricted channel approach was suggested in ref .",
    ", without orbital relaxation in the field of the core hole .",
    "like tddft , the complex polarization propagator method@xcite is also based on response theory . with this method",
    ", the absorption of the system at a given frequency can be calculated by solving a response matrix equation ; the interesting energy region can be sampled without solving explicitly for the excited states .",

    "we have recently found @xcite rew - tddft to be more accurate in predicting frequency splitting in xanes and computationally less demanding than stex .",
    "brena et al .",
    "had pointed out that tddft core excitation energies have larger absolute errors than those from stex or transition - state calculations , because tddft does not account for orbital relaxation and self - interaction of core electrons.@xcite we found the same trend.@xcite apart from an overall shift , tddft core excitation energies agree with the xanes of many systems very well.@xcite the tddft core - edge energy can be improved by applying the perdew - zunger self - interaction correction scheme,@xcite or by employing recently - developed core - valence hybrid functional,@xcite long - range corrected hybrid functional with short - range gaussian attenuation@xcite and short - range corrected functionals.@xcite these techniques yield core - edge energies with errors less than 1ev on a series of small molecules.@xcite more precise benchmarks will be needed to compare the accuracy of stex and rew - tddft .",
    "adiabatic tddft can not deal with double excitations.@xcite practical frequency - dependent xc kernels for medium or large molecular systems have yet to be developed .",
    "both tddft and the excited state core hole ( xch ) method@xcite treat singly core - excited state ( sces ) very well .",
    "the excited electron in xch approximation is included self - consistently through a full core hole state .",

    "we will use xch in this paper .",
    "pseudopotentials can be constructed for single@xcite and double core hole states .",
    "an effective potential which ignores the polarizability of the core hole in different chemical environments will introduce errors into practical calculations .",
    "a fixed pseudopential of a core hole , like the eca , ignores all core hole dynamics .",
    "here we employ an approach that combines xch and rew - tddft .",
    "we first run an scf calculation to get a reference state sces0 , with a core hole and an excited electron .",
    "this reference is then used to run a rew - tddft calculation to obtain excited states with two core - holes and two excited electrons .",
    "tddft only treats single excitations of the sces0 reference , not all double core excited states are accounted for .",
    "additional dcess can be found by starting rew - tddft at different sces references , obtained by permuting the occupied and virtual orbitals of sces0 ( orbital approximation as in ref . ) .",
    "unrestricted reference - based tddft is known to suffer from spin contamination.@xcite a truncated rank of excitations from one component of a spin multiplet generates an incomplete configuration space for the total spin operator @xmath5.@xcite stated differently , higher rank excited configurations are needed to represent a pure spin state .",
    "our current tddft calculations on a spin symmetry - broken reference state are no exception , but since the singlet - triplet energy splitting is negligible compared to the large energies of core excitations , spin contamination does not strongly affect the calculated core excitation energies .",
    "casida and coworkers suggested to use the difference of the total spin between excited states and the reference state ( @xmath6 ) in order to filter out unphysical excited states.@xcite we follow his scheme by only including excited states with small @xmath7s in our calculations .",
    "the two sequential core excitations can not be treated in the same fashion .",
    "after the initial excitation , the valence electrons relax self - consistently ( xch ) in the field of the core hole , and the second excitation is treated using response theory ( rew - tddft ) .",
    "this treatment uses two potentials to perturb the valence band during the second excitation : a strong , long duration core hole potential which must be treated nonperturbatively , and the ultrafast second photon excitation , which can be truncated at first order using response theory .",
    "this physically intuitive order in which relaxation precedes photon excitation strongly effects the signal , as we show later by reversing it , treating the original first core excitation using rew - tddft and the original second using xch .",

    "[ fig : scfordercomparison ] we present an example of the opposite protocol for the onno technique : the @xmath77 states are generated using scf relaxation for core hole b and then response theory for core hole a ( protocol ii ) .",
    "we observe a different blurred line pattern in the spectra obtained with protocol ii ( see fig . [",
    "fig : scfordercomparison ] ) .",
    "different levels of theory show a different type of dces - sces correlation .",
    "the protocol i diagram a signal also shows a stronger diagonal component than the corresponding protocol ii signal , which displays a different density of two - particle states on the @xmath24 axis . comparing xdqc signals from different pulse orders with experiments",
    "should reveal how well those theories treat the very specific correlation between a dces and sces .",
    "this could be valuable in future methodology development for dcess .",
    "another portion of the signal , @xmath78 , is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2dqct15fsonno ] and [ fig:2dqct15fsnono ] . in these graphs ,",
    "resonances along @xmath24 correspond to doubly excited states ( @xmath66 ) , and @xmath25 shows the final single excited states ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) in the xdqc process . as with the @xmath81 signals , there are diagonal characteristics in the onno spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2dqct15fsonno ] ) which are absent in the nono spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2dqct15fsnono ] ) . this is further evidence for the increased correlations for the states probed by the onno process . in the @xmath81",
    "signal the resonances for both a and b diagrams are the same , only the phases for two contributions differ .",
    "the @xmath78 signal has qualitatively different peaks along @xmath25 for the two diagrams , as expected , since these diagrams differ in this time period .",
    "typically the overlaps of valence holes or electron orbitals are higher than those of core holes or electrons .",
    "the correlations between valence excitations are stronger than those between core excitations , which makes the corresponding dqc signals more complicated than those in the present work.@xcite we have demonstrated qualitative differences in the stimulated xdqc signals depending on the order of core - excitations at different elements in a small organic molecule . as an experimental technique , xdqc may be used to fingerprint different theoretical approaches for modeling core - excitation , by dissecting dynamical doubly - core - excited resonances corresponding to the effects of valence relaxation induced by the core hole .",
    "additional work will be required to further analyze the spectra reported here .",
    "first , a detailed description of the valence dynamics , and a comparison of the tddft theory with the more easily interpreted orbital theory should highlight the effect of electron correlation on the xdqc signal .",
    "second , with a higher level of theory to describe dcess , the variation of the @xmath24 resonances with @xmath10 can be used to measure how the order of core - excitation affects the two - particle density of states .",
    "the core hole has a unit charge which creates a very strong field over atomic length scales .",
    "if the delay between the first two pulses is varied , the changes in the @xmath77 resonances along @xmath24 will reflect the order of perturbation theory necessary to correctly model this strong interaction with the valence band .",
    "for short @xmath10 , linear response theory alone , or supplemented with a full or partial core hole orbital transformation may adequately capture this effect , as it does in linear absorption .",
    "we demonstrated significant differences between the xdqc signals predicted by the calculation protocols .",
    "interpolation between the extremes of linear response ( first order ) , and a full scf calculation will require a higher level of theory to describe many - body effects in the core - excitation .    in the simulations presented here the relaxation of single and double core - excited states , is treated phenomenologically .",
    "we only include population decay through auger or a radiative process that destroys the core hole .",
    "we further use the same decay rate for all scess and dcess , independent of the orbitals involved .",
    "interaction of the system with a bath , composed of vibrational and valence - electron degrees of freedom , could introduce additional pure dephasing .",
    "nonlinear spectroscopy has been successful in lower frequency regimes ( nmr to the visible ) at disentangling different underlying mechanisms for excited state decay and dephasing.@xcite similar effects are expected in core - excitation spectra . estimating their magnitude , comparing them to population decay rates , and designing experiments that distinguish between them is an interesting future topic .",
    "one manifestation of these effects in existing x - ray experiments are fluorescence vs. raman signals , which are controlled by the ratio of pure dephasing and population relaxation rates .",
    "the dipole and electric field polarization tensor contributions to the signal must be rotationally averaged over all possible orientations of the molecule .",
    "the rotationally averaged@xcite signal is @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the the polarization of the @xmath85th pulse polarization vector , and @xmath86 represent various contractions over the tensor components of the response ; @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the all parallel pulse configuration , the signal is proportional to the sum of all three @xmath90    140ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] ",
