    "how disorder affects the intrinsic diffusion of a particle is a question of extreme practical relevance .",
    "it is often encountered in transport processes @xcite whenever one attempts to confront theoretical predictions with actual experiments .",
    "not surprisingly , the study of disorder has attracted a lot of interest in a variety of contexts and often with the aim of understanding the validity of the theoretical assumptions of idealized systems @xcite .",
    "although many different kinds exist , disordered systems are broadly divided into two classes depending on the type of heterogeneity : static or dynamic @xcite .",
    "when the heterogeneity is due to the presence of some ` quenched ' observables that do not change over time , one talks about a system with static disorder ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , when the heterogeneity emerges as the system evolves in time , one talks about dynamic disorder ( see e.g. @xcite ) . of interest here",
    "is one of the simplest dynamically disordered system : a random walker constrained to move within an area whose extent is randomly fluctuating .",
    "a problem where dynamic disorder plays a fundamental role is the formation of territorial patterns in the animal kingdom .",
    "a recent study @xcite shows how territories ( spatial inhomogeneity ) collectively emerge from the spatio - temporal trajectories of individual animals with interactions between them mediated via scent marks . in that study a microscopic stochastic model of territorial random walkers",
    "is introduced whereby each animal performs a random walk @xcite with the added ingredient that , when an animal visits a site , it leaves its scent that lasts for a fixed time @xmath0 . during this time",
    ", no other animal can visit this site . as a result",
    ", each animal has a territory at any given instant @xmath1 .",
    "this territory is the set of sites visited by the animal in the time period @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "an animal can diffuse only over sites that belong to its own territory and those sites which do not belong to the territory of any other animal .",
    "thus , both the animals and their respective territories move with time , but their growth rates are different .",
    "the centroids of the territories subdiffuse , due to the exclusion principle @xcite , while the animals themselves move diffusively .",
    "one of our aims is to reduce , in the 1d case , the many - body non - markovian problem of territory formation to the one - body problem of a random walker moving within a random environment .",
    "the wildly different time scales over which territories and animals displace , allows us to find the appropriate one - body effective description .",
    "if we focus on a specific individual , we can view it as being subject to reflecting boundary conditions , located at the position of the left and right neighbouring territorial borders , that are changing gradually relative to the time scale over which the walker diffuses .",
    "this gradual change in the external conditions ( environment ) is what characterizes an adiabatic process .",
    "we thus invoke an adiabatic approximation , which consists of taking the probability distribution of the walker to be identical to the one governed by a diffusion equation within an interval equal to the instantaneous separation distance between the neighboring territorial borders .",
    "the joint probability distribution @xmath3 of the walker position @xmath4 and , respectively , the left and right boundary locations @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be written as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the walker probability distribution for a given value of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and with @xmath9 , the joint distribution of the two boundary positions , to be determined .",
    "our goal here is to show that it is possible to capture the dynamics of the random walkers in the territoriality problem by representing the dynamics of @xmath9 through a fokker - planck formalism @xcite with time - dependent diffusion coefficients .",

    "the paper ends with a brief discussion in sec .",
    "since territorial boundaries undergo an exclusion process , the probability distribution of the separation distance between the left and right boundaries can be represented at long times by a gaussian whose width is increasing proportionally to @xmath10 rather than @xmath1 , or by a diffusion equation with an appropriate time - dependent diffusion constant @xcite .",
    "the mean of this gaussian is centered around the average territory size , which is simply the inverse of the population density @xcite . in",
    "our reduced one - body problem we mimic the presence of a mean territory size and fluctuations around this mean by assuming that the left and right boundaries are attached by a spring , whose rest position equals the mean territory size @xmath11 .",
