    "however , this method does nt allow quantitative measurements , as the heating power is not focused on the sample , but irradiates also the pressure transmitting medium ( argon ) and the gasket which are heated and contribute to an additional background signal which changes between different experiments . to find the optimal working frequency @xmath30 ,",
    "the frequency dependence of the ac signal was measured at 1.5  k and 4.2  k. the cut off frequency @xmath31 was found to be about 600  hz , the measurements were performed at 831  hz slightly above @xmath31 .",
    "the specific heat of the sample can be estimated by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the measured voltage and the thermopower of the thermocouple . as the origin of the phase @xmath35 can not be determined by our method , we neglect in the analysis the contribution of the phase signal . however",
    "a comparison of the behaviour of the signal at low pressure with an absolute measurement at ambient pressure shows , that observed ac signal is correct .",

    "the sample and the gasket are in the middle of the lower detection coil .",
    "this geometry allows a very good compensation of the susceptometer at fixed temperature , however the filling factor is poor .",
    "an additional difficulty is coming from a temperature drift of the background signal which can not be compensated .",
    "the measurements were performed at 71  hz , and before each run the susceptometer was offset at the lowest temperature by compensating the amplitude and the phase of the signal with a small compensation coil which is wounded directly on the excitation coil .",

    "the onset of the superconducting transition by susceptibility ( @xmath57 ) is at higher temperatures than the onset of the transition by specific heat ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "a cascade @xmath59 of superconducting transition temperatures determined by resistivity @xmath60 , susceptibility and specific heat measurements is characteristic of heterogeneous material .      in figure [ figure :",
    "cerhin5_phase_diagram ] , we summarize the phase diagram of cerhin@xmath0 obtained by specific heat and susceptibility measurements .",
    "in addition we plotted @xmath3 obtained by resistivity measurements @xmath61 from llobet _ et al .",
    "the phase diagram of cerhin@xmath0 can be divided in three different parts : at low pressure , @xmath62 gpa , the ground state is purely antiferromagnetic . in a limited pressure range",
    "0.9 gpa@xmath63  gpa superconductivity and antiferromagnetism may coexist , and for @xmath64  gpa the ground state is superconducting .",

    "let us first discuss the afm transition",
    ". at low pressures @xmath66 is first increasing with pressure and has a smooth maximum at @xmath67  gpa . in the intermediate pressure range 0.9  gpa@xmath68 2  gpa",
    ", @xmath37 is monotonously decreasing up to 1.9  gpa , with a continuously increasing rate exceeding 2  k / gpa at @xmath2 . near @xmath2 , the magnetic transition gets very broad and the amplitude of the magnetic transition is strongly decreasing compared to the low pressure measurements .",
    "these broadening effects will be more quantitatively discussed in the next section .",
    "let us note that both nqr and specific heat measurements agree on the fact that above @xmath2 , no afm order is observed : the ground state for @xmath69 _ is a pure superconducting state_. as regard even the latest neutron measurements @xcite , they do not extend beyond @xmath70  gpa .",
    "however , the strange result ( in apparent contradiction with the slow nqr probe ( @xmath71  s ) ) is that the low temperature ordered moment determined by a quasi - instant probe as neutron scattering ( @xmath72  s ) does not collapse with @xmath37 close to @xmath2 , but the staggered moment is almost constant up to 1.85 gpa .",
    "switching now to the superconducting transition , the most remarkable fact is the absence of afm order below @xmath3 above @xmath2 : for @xmath69 the ground state is a pure superconducting state .",
    "nice superconducting anomalies are observed , becoming sharper near the maximum @xmath73  k at 2.55  gpa . at this pressure ,",
    "the transition width is comparable to the superconducting transition in cecoin@xmath0 at ambient pressure . for higher pressures @xmath3 determined from the specific heat experiment decreases with a rate of -0.7k / gpa .",
    "resistivity measurements by muramatsu _",
    "_ show that superconductivity is completely suppressed at a pressure @xmath26 of @xmath74  gpa @xcite .",
    "contrary to the previous work @xcite , we do not observe any round anomaly above @xmath2 due to its normale phase , and a fortiori no sign of afm transition . in agreement with @xcite",
    ", we also do not observe any sign of an afm transition below @xmath3 , even very close from @xmath2 .",
    "so in cerhin@xmath0 , @xmath37 is not suppressed continuously to zero , but has a finite value at @xmath2 .",
    "it demonstrates the absence of a quantum critical point in cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "thermodynamically , it means that once @xmath3 is above @xmath37 , the free energy of the superconducting state is lower than that of the afm state , whatever the temperature , and that in cerhin@xmath0 , contrary to the usual consensus on heavy fermion superconductors , afm order and superconductivity compete .",
    "this has also consequences on the pairing mechanism : this competition and the closeness of the energy scales of both phenomenon , makes the afm correlations as a sole source of the pairing mechanism very unlikely . for example , an extraordinary strong coupling regime would be required to explain that the maximum @xmath3 is so close ( a factor of @xmath75 ) to the maximum @xmath37 .",
    "further , the superconducting anomaly @xmath24 is largest in the pressure range from 2.5  gpa to 3  gpa , pointing to the maximum of the pairing interation for sc above @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly this is the pressure range where the resistivity has a linear temperature dependence above @xmath3 and the residual resistivity @xmath76 a maximum as function of pressure @xcite .",
    "this points to the probable importance of valence fluctuations in the superconducting pairing mechanism @xcite .",
    "the regime above @xmath2 puts also severe constraints on the possible coexistence regime below @xmath2 . in resistivity measurements on high quality crystals in los alamos@xcite ,",
    "sc is found down to much lower pressures than @xmath2 : @xmath77 gpa .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath78 coincides almost with the pressure of the maximum of @xmath37 .",
    "the transition temperatures @xmath3 determined from the ac susceptibility measurements are in good agreement with these resistivity measurements . however , with ac calorimetry , we find a superconducting anomaly only very close to the critical pressure @xmath50  gpa .",
    "this questions the homogenous coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in this pressure range , as the observed transitions in resistivity and susceptibility are not a bulk probe of superconductivity . from the specific heat measurements ,",
    "we know that at 1.5 gpa , @xmath3 , if non zero , is below 1.5 k. so instead of @xmath77 gpa , we expect an almost vertical line between @xmath25 and @xmath2 .",
    "this would mean that the line @xmath28 drawn by resistivity or susceptibility measurements within the afm state does not reflect a bulk transition , and might be connected to internal stress inside the sample , like in ceirin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this also means that previous claims of a coexistence of afm order and superconductivity @xcite relying on the observation of afm order below the resistive @xmath3 in the pressure range between @xmath25 and @xmath2 are not a definite proof of that coexistence .",
    "differences in @xmath57 and @xmath58 are also observed above 2.5  gpa , the pressure of maximum @xmath3 .",
    "of course , in our scenario of a direct afm @xmath79 sc transition , the line between afm and sc is expected to be a first order line , owing to the sudden disappearance of the magnetic order parameter ( and in agreement with the strong slope of @xmath80 ) .",
    "further intrinsic phase separation with a mixed phase may be possible . in cein@xmath5 , phase separation",
    "was nicely demonstrated by nqr @xcite .    to summarize this discussion , from our specific heat and ac susceptibility measurements , two different scenarii are possible ;",
    "( i ) the appearance of superconductivity in the antiferromagnetic ordered state is not homogenous and no true afm+sc state exists .",
    "the experimental observations would then result from superconducting filaments , which can be created due to internal stress induced by dislocations or stacking faults , or due to a phase segregation in a pure magnetically ordered and in a superconducting volume fraction .",
    "with increasing pressure the antiferromagnetic volume is decreasing and the paramagnetic volume which has a superconducting ground state increases .",
    "above @xmath2 , only the superconducting state survives .",
    "( ii ) the coexistence is really homogenous , which means that the same electrons are responsible for the antiferromagnetic order and for superconductivity . in this case",
    "the missing anomaly of specific heat is due to a gapless superconducting state which is not explained by impurities , and the coexistence phase corresponds to a new class of superconducting states @xcite . in the following , both possibilities will be discussed , also we strongly believe in the first scenario .",
    "figure [ figure : cerhin5_boadening_afm]a shows the specific heat in a normalized representation @xmath81 as function of @xmath82 . to quantify the observed broadening of the magnetic anomaly",
    ", we arbitrarily define the full width of the transition when @xmath83 .",
    "the relative width of the antiferromagnetic transition as a function of pressure is then shown in the inset of figure [ figure : cerhin5_boadening_afm]b .",
    "a change of regime is clearly visible at 0.9  gpa where @xmath37 starts to decrease and superconductivity is observed by llobet et al.@xcite . at low pressure",
    "the anomaly is rather sharp , but for @xmath84  gpa it gets continuously broader .",
    "however , several effects come into play .",
    "part of the width is intrinsic , coming from the fluctuations , and it is expected to yield a constant value of @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , material inhomogeneities , internal or external stress , pressure gradients , might give a pressure dependent contribution to @xmath86 .",
    "some of these effects will be proportional to the pressure variation of @xmath37and so to @xmath87 in a first approximation ( see [ figure : cerhin5_boadening_afm]b ) .",
    "detailed measurements show that the pressure variation in a diamond anvil cell with argon in the low pressure range ( @xmath88  gpa ) is generally lower than 0.04  gpa @xcite . considering the width and also the shape of the ruby spectra",
    ", we could not detect any significant broadening of these spectra over the whole investigated pressure range . if the observed broadening would result only from pressure inhomogeneities in the pressure cell , this would require pressure inhomogeneities of the order of 0.055  gpa near @xmath89 gpa , which can be excluded .",
    "further , the observed very sharp superconducting transition at 2.4 and 2.55  gpa in different pressure cells are a posteriori a strong indication of high hydrostaticity . here",
    "the width of the transition , @xmath90  mk , is comparable to the superconducting transition of cecoin@xmath0 at ambient pressure ( see below ) .",
    "this clearly shows that the broadening of the magnetic transition on approaching the critical point is not related to the pressure cell .",
    "similar behaviour has been observed in other heavy fermion systems like cein@xmath5 @xcite , cepd@xmath4si@xmath4 @xcite and cerh@xmath4si@xmath4 @xcite too . theoretically , in the case of a second order phase transition which ends at the critical pressure @xmath2 , the form of the mean field magnetic transition for @xmath91 is sharp .",
    "only the size of the anomaly is decreasing as the ordered magnetic moment is decreasing @xcite , which is not even the case in cerhin@xmath0 @xcite . as regard impurity effects , in the classical framework of a second order phase transition ( harris criterion @xcite )",
    ", they are believed to change the critical behaviour only if the specific heat diverges at @xmath37 .    here",
    "the phenomena is quite different and more similar to surface problems found in magnetism or for some local structural transitions .",
    "physically it seems that the magnetic coherence length at @xmath37 can not exceed a critical value @xmath92 . as for @xmath93",
    "the magnetic coherence length at @xmath94 will increase strongly , there is a severe cut off in the development of a large coherence length and thus in a corresponding smearing of the specific heat anomaly .    in the pressure range of a first order transition the entropy drop @xmath95 associated to the magnetic transition",
    "is linked to the slope of @xmath96 according to the clapeyron relation @xmath97 , where is @xmath98 is the volume discontinuity .",
    "the final vertical slope of @xmath96 as @xmath94 reflects the collapse of the entropy in agreement with the nernst principle .",
    "as the material is highly sensitive to imperfections , the entropy drop corresponds to a broad specific heat anomaly .",
    "the corresponding entropy contribution @xmath95 reflects the amplitude of @xmath96 as by contrast the volume discontinuity may change weakly under pressure .",
    "so it is quite reasonable that the specific heat anomaly of the magnetic transition disappears drastically on approaching @xmath2 .",
    "internal stress may lead to drastic features as antagonistic behavior are often observed in the variation of the nel temperature for a strain @xmath99 applied in nonequivalent directions . well known examples for tetragonal systems are cepd@xmath4si@xmath4 @xcite or uru@xmath4si@xmath4 @xcite . in the last one",
    "the values at ambient pressure are : @xmath100  mk / gpa and @xmath101  mk / gpa for @xmath102  k. the strain dependence of @xmath3 in uru@xmath4si@xmath4 illustrates the antagonism between magnetism and superconductivity as the respective variations of @xmath3 and @xmath103 are opposite : @xmath104  mk / gpa and @xmath105  mk / gpa for @xmath106  k. huge effects have also been detected in the pressure dependence of @xmath37 in cepd@xmath4si@xmath4 measured on two crystals with the @xmath107 axis parallel or perpendicular to the pressure gradient due to the non - hydrostaticity of the pressure cell @xcite .",
    "of course , as the superconducting domain is locked at @xmath2 , a large difference appears also in @xmath108 . to summarize the broadening is strongly associated to the magnitude of @xmath109 and thus the calorimetric anomaly collapses at @xmath2 .    in figure",
    "[ figure : cerhin5_boadening_supra ] the transition width of the superconducting transition above @xmath2 is shown as function of pressure , and in figure [ figure : cerhin5_boadening_afm ] that of the afm transition below @xmath2 . in this system , due to the competition between afm and sc order",
    ", we rather expect that these respective transition width are related to the strength of the pressure variation of their own critical temperature . what is more , in the 115 series",
    ", the main source of heterogeneities may be that internal pressure or strain gradients in the material itself .",
    "thus , local distributions of @xmath3 or @xmath37 may be induced .",
    "it is well known that near defects like dislocations or stacking faults , internal strain of the order of 0.1 gpa can occur .",
    "evidences for such an effect are given in the paramagnetic state of ceirin@xmath0 at zero pressure as @xmath110 k is quite different from @xmath111 k @xcite . in that case , the superconducting transition observed by resistivity is clearly due to superconducting filaments .",
    "this big mismatch of @xmath3 as measured by resistivity or specific heat seems again directly linked with the difference between @xmath112  mk / gpa and @xmath113  mk / gpa @xcite .",
    "of course an extra cause of heterogeneity can be induced by the non hydrostaticity of the pressure transmitting medium . however , in our case , the use of argon optimizes the hydrostaticity .    to demonstrate the impact of internal strain or pressure inhomogeneities when @xmath114 and @xmath115 have a strong pressure dependence , we have calculated the temperature dependence of the specific heat near the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting transition under the assumption of a pressure distribution inside the sample , of width @xmath116 , which may be caused by the experimental conditions or by inhomogeneities in the material . for the antiferromagnetic transition ( see figure [ figure : cerhin5_cp_fit]a ) we suppose that in an hypothetical ideally hydrostatic pressure cell , the shape of the specific heat anomaly would remain unchanged whatever the transition temperature .",
    "we have further assumed that at low pressure , the pressure variation of @xmath37 is small and we can take the curve at 0.65 gpa as the ideal curve .",
    "indeed , @xmath117 for 0.65  gpa , so that pressure gradients should have only minor effects on the shape of @xmath38 .",
    "we assume a gaussian pressure distribution inside the sample , so that the form of the specific heat anomaly for an mean average pressure @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 \\left.\\frac{c}{t}\\right|_{0.65}\\left(\\frac{t}{t_n(p)}\\right ) dp.\\ ] ] the weighting factor w includes the normalization of the gaussian distribution , and normalization of @xmath120 with respect to entropy balance : @xmath121 should be proportional to @xmath37 for localized magnetism , or constant for itinerant magnetism .",
    "the difference in the resulting curves is found to be insignificant for the pressure distribution involved in this experiment .",
    "calculated specific heat transitions for the experimental pressures @xmath118 and a pressure distribution of @xmath122  gpa are shown in figure [ figure : cerhin5_cp_fit ] .",
    "they have to be compared to the measurements ( see figure [ figure : cerhin5_specific_heat1 ] ) .",
    "the broadening in the range where @xmath109 is steep , is clearly visible in the calculations and it is in qualitative agreement with the measurements .    a more quantitative comparison between experiment and these calculations has been done for the superconducting transition , with the same pressure distribution @xmath122  gpa .",
    "we have calculated the specific heat near the superconducting transition for @xmath17  gpa ( see figure [ figure : cerhin5_cp_fit]b ) .",
    "the entropy balance imposes that @xmath123 at @xmath3 for all pressures .",
    "we have assumed a power law dependence of @xmath124 in the superconducting state @xcite , adjusting the exponent @xmath125 ( which depends on the relative specific heat jump at @xmath3 ) in order to fulfill the entropy balance .",
    "so calculation of @xmath38 for a fixed pressure distribution @xmath116 is controlled by two parameters : @xmath28 , which is known from the phase diagram , and the size of the anomaly at the average pressure ( which controls @xmath125 ) .",
    "the comparison with the measurements ( see figure [ figure : cerhin5_c(t)_supra ] ) shows that the broadening of the transition for pressures below and above the maximum of @xmath108 can be understood with the same fixed pressure distribution .    to summarize",
    ", a fixed gaussian pressure distribution of about 0.055  gpa can explain the observed broadening of the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting transitions , as a result of the pressure dependence of @xmath37 and @xmath3 . as regard the origin of this pressure distribution , 0.04",
    "gpa is really the upper limit expected for inhomogeneities inside a pressure cell filled with argon .",
    "more reasonably , these inhomogeneities could be due to internal strain and defects in combination with the anisotropic elastic properties of the material @xcite .",
    "the question of a gapless sc state below @xmath2 started with recent nqr results @xcite : just above @xmath2 , the nuclear relaxation time follows the usual behavior of an unconventional sc state with line nodes : below @xmath3 , @xmath126 has a nice @xmath127 dependence .",
    "this contrasts with the situation below @xmath2 .",
    "for example at 1.6 gpa , below @xmath57 , @xmath126 reaches rapidly at low temperatures @xmath128 a value corresponding to the normal phase @xcite . according to fisher _",
    "@xcite , the specific heat coefficient @xmath129 increases by a factor 3 to 4 from 0 to 1.6  gpa .",
    "this increase of the effective mass leads to an increase of @xmath126 by one order of magnitude , as observed in the experiment .",
    "we have stressed that our measurements and analysis do not support an intrinsic afm+sc state between @xmath25 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , a gapless state in this pressure region could be possible without any additional line in the phase diagram ( a continuous evolution of the gap amplitude collapsing when on approaching @xmath2 from the high pressure region would not necessarily induce symmetry changes ) .",
    "this gapless state can not be due to impurity scattering , as the criterion for clean limit are satisfied as well below and above @xmath2 : the sample investigated in our measurement has a residual resistivity ratio of almost 200 which shows that it is very clean .    the possibility of the realization of @xmath130-wave spin singlet superconductivity , whose gap function is odd in frequency and momentum , was very recently discussed by fuseya et al.@xcite .",
    "they showed that near a quantum critical point where strong retardation effects are possible , this @xmath130-wave state is more likely than the @xmath22-wave state which is expected to be realized away from the critical point in the antiferromagnetic as well as in the paramagnetic regime . a quantum critical point is not observed in our experiment , and a gapless region is also not observed above @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this difference might arise from the first order nature of the afm @xmath79 sc transition .",
    "the nqr results were interpreted with a heuristic view in favour of this new class of superconducting phase below @xmath2 which differs from the usual @xmath22 wave pairing @xcite . basically , the bare experimental features are similar to those observed here : @xmath131 , the superconducting onset chosen in resistivity is higher than @xmath57 where diamagnetic shielding is observed .",
    "@xmath57 appears to coincide with the temperature where tiny features appear in the temperature variation of @xmath126 of the inverse product of the nuclear relaxation time @xmath132 by temperature .    from our point of view",
    ", the difficulty with this scenario is both quantitative : it is not expected that @xmath3 could rise up to @xmath37 ( at @xmath2 ) , and qualitative : switching from a gapless @xmath130-wave state below @xmath2 to a gaped @xmath22-wave state above @xmath2 would involve a symmetry change and thus transform the tricritical point at @xmath2 to a tetracritical point .",
    "we would rather interpret the `` gapless '' nature of superconductivity observed by nqr as related to the heterogeneities observed in the magnetic transition .",
    "however , it is obvious that the debate remains .",
    "an important issue is to discuss more deeply the discrepancy between neutron diffraction and nqr measurements in the afm phase .",
    "the specific heat under high pressure of cecoin@xmath0 is shown in figure [ figure : cac_cecoin5_fit ] .",
    "up to 1.5  gpa , the anomaly under high pressures is almost as sharp as at ambient pressure , whereas at higher pressures the anomaly start to get broader .",
    "the phase diagram obtained from specific heat and ac susceptibility measurements is shown in figure [ figure : cecoin5_phase_diagram ] . with increasing pressure @xmath3 is increasing with an initial rate of 0.6  k / gpa up to 1.6 gpa , for higher pressure it decreases with a rate of 0.3  k / gpa which is slower than the diminutions of @xmath3 in cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "the very large jump at ambient pressure in the specific heat @xmath133 , which is the largest found in heavy fermion superconductors , was first interpreted as a hint for strong coupling superconductivity in cecoin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of the the jump of the specific heat at @xmath3 is shown in figure [ figure : cecoin5_delta_c ] . the height of the jump obtained by sparn _ et al . _",
    "was used to determine the background signal for the ac calorimetry and to normalize the jump obtained by ac calorimetry .",
    "the background is of about 40% of the measured ac signal in the normal state and it is assumed to be linear in temperature and independent of pressure .    by increasing pressure the large jump in the specific heat decreases linearly to @xmath134 at 3  gpa .",
    "the reduction of the jump with pressure is clearly an indication of the reduction of the effective mass @xmath135 with increasing pressure . neglecting strong coupling effects",
    ", the jump of the specific heat normalized to the effective mass @xmath136 must be fulfilled .",
    "however , the weakness of strong coupling is justified by the temperature variation of the upper critical field of cecoin@xmath0 , which can be expressed in a weak coupling model with strong pauli limitation .",
    "the large jump at ambient pressure is due to the fact that superconductivity sets in when the heavy fermion state is not yet formed and the effective mass is still increasing to lower temperatures .",
    "measurements of the specific heat in field at 5  t parallel to @xmath107 axis show that @xmath38 is increasing to lowest temperatures @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath38 is a strong indication that cecoin@xmath0 at ambient pressure is close to a magnetic instability and the system can be driven through a quantum critical point by applying a magnetic field higher than the upper critical field . by contrast , at 3  gpa superconductivity sets in when the heavy masses are formed and cecoin@xmath0 behaves as a usual heavy fermion system .",
    "the decrease of the effective mass with pressure has been seen directly by de haas - van alphen experiments under high pressure @xcite .    to estimate the influence of pressure inhomogeneities on the superconducting transition in cecoin@xmath0 we calculated the specific heat in the same manner than for cerhin@xmath0 ( see above ) .",
    "however , in addition the pressure dependence of the effective mass @xmath135 has to taken into account .",
    "the lines in figure [ figure : cac_cecoin5_fit ] are the results of the calculations .",
    "contrasting with cerhin@xmath0 , for cecoin@xmath0 the pressure distribution increases linearly from @xmath137 gpa at ambient pressure to @xmath138 at 2.9  gpa .",
    "we can exclude that this increase of inhomogeneity is due to bare pressure gradients .",
    "but it could arise from the material itself .",
    "as pointed out above , uniaxial stress applied in different crystallographic directions may result in opposite effects on @xmath3 , @xmath139 and @xmath140",
    ". a stress distribution proportional to the pressure would be the most likely source of this linear increase of @xmath116 .",
    "the effect of `` pressure '' inhomogeneities is expected to be more important in cecoin@xmath0 than in cerhin@xmath0 , as the anisotropy of the elastic constants of this compound is the largest of the ce 115 compounds @xcite .",
    "recently the so - called fulde , ferrel , larkin , ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase has been found in cecoin@xmath0 below @xmath141 close to the upper critical field @xmath142 for the magnetic field @xmath143 applied in the basal plane @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the paramagnetic limit @xmath144 in tesla assuming @xmath145 for the conduction electrons governs the behaviour of the upper critical field at very low temperatures since the orbital limit @xmath146 is far higher than @xmath147 .",
    "nevertheless , the balance between the orbital and paramagnetic limit is expected to change under pressure , due to the variation of @xmath3 ( which controls @xmath148 ) and of @xmath135 , which controls , together with @xmath3 , the @xmath149 .",
    "in fact , both @xmath28 and @xmath150 are known from our experiment , so we could estimate what should be the relative variation of @xmath151 under pressure in a classical calculation of @xmath152 including the fflo state ( see for example reference @xcite ) .",
    "it is reported on figure [ figure : fflo_p ] . from the strong decrease of the effective mass under pressure",
    ", we would have expected a drastic decrease of @xmath151 under pressure : this is not the case , due to the initial increase of @xmath3 which compensates the drop of @xmath135 with @xmath153 .",
    "one can predict that @xmath151 will start to decrease significantly only near 1.5  gpa , i.e. when @xmath3 reaches its maximum , despite the fact that at this pressure , @xmath135 has decreased by a factor of 2 .",
    "of course , this prediction is valid only in a classical scheme : it might be different if for example the interaction itself change with the magnetic field since the fllo state appears for magnetic fields just above the field @xmath154 where pseudo - metamagnetism may occur @xcite .",
    "we studied the specific heat of cerhin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 under high pressure by ac calorimetry and ac susceptibility up to 3.5  gpa . in cerhin@xmath0 a first order transition from antiferromagnetic order below @xmath50  gpa to a superconducting ground state for @xmath17  gpa has been observed . below @xmath2",
    "superconductivity and antiferromagnetism coexist .",
    "however , in this regime no superconducting specific heat anomaly has been observed which points to an inhomogeneous appearance of superconductivity in this pressure range . above @xmath2",
    "the very sharp superconducting specific heat anomaly is due to homogenous bulk superconductivity .",
    "the large jump of the specific heat in cecoin@xmath0 at the superconducting transition is reduced linearly with increasing pressure .",
    "this is a clear indication for the decrease of the effective mass with pressure and the system is tuned away from its magnetic instability . at high pressure , cecoin@xmath0 behaves like a usual heavy fermion superconductor .",
