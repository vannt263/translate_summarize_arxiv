    "in 1934 born and infeld proposed a non - linear action for classical electrodynamics , which is characterized by its success in solving the divergence of the self - energy of point - like charges @xcite . since their proposal , modified theories of gravity with a born - infeld - inspired action have received much attention ( initiated in ref .  ) .",
    "these theories not only maintain the properties of general relativity ( gr ) for small curvatures , but provide various interesting deviations from gr at high curvature regimes . some of these amendments are hoped to shed some light on smoothing the singularities in gr .",
    "for example , recently a theory dubbed eddington - inspired - born - infeld theory ( eibi ) @xcite has been studied from both astrophysical and cosmological points of view .",
    "the eibi theory is shown to be able to cure the big bang singularity for a radiation dominated universe .",
    "therefore , in refs .",
    "and we carry out a thorough analysis on the possible avoidance of other cosmological singularities such as big rip , sudden , big freeze , type iv singularities , and little rip event in the eibi theory .",
    "we find that though the big rip singularity and little rip can not be avoided , most of the cosmological singularities can be alleviated in the eibi theory @xcite .    in ref .  , we extend the eibi theory by adding a trace term into the determinantal action .",
    "it corresponds to the most general action constructed from a rank two tensor that contains up to first order terms in curvature .",
    "this model can provide smooth bouncing solutions which were not allowed in the eibi model for the same eibi coupling .",
    "most interestingly , for a radiation filled universe there are some regions of the parameter space that can naturally lead to a de sitter inflationary stage without any exotic matter field .",

    "then we have @xmath28      we then analyze the possible avoidance of phantom dark energy related singularities in the eibi setup .",
    "these singularities are characterized by possible divergence of the hubble parameter and its cosmic time derivatives at some finite cosmic time ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
