    "with the integrated luminosity of about 50  pb@xmath2 collected at hera during the years 19941997 a new kinematic domain of large @xmath0 and @xmath1 becomes accessible for the study of deep inelastic scattering in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "measurements by zeus of the @xmath4 single differential neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) born cross sections for @xmath5  gev@xmath6  have recently become available  @xcite .",
    "standard model ( sm ) predictions calculated with , for instance , the parton distribution set cteq4  @xcite are in good agreement with the nc cross sections but fall below the cc measurements at large @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this could be an indication of new physics beyond the sm but might also be due to an imperfect knowledge of the parton densities in this kinematic region .",
    "for instance in  @xcite it is shown that a modification of the cteq4 down quark density yields sm predictions in agreement with the cc @xmath4 data .    to investigate these issues",
    "we have performed a global nlo qcd analysis  @xcite of structure function data to obtain the parton densities in the proton .",
    "a full error analysis provides estimates of the uncertainties in these parton densities , the structure functions and the sm predictions of the nc and cc cross sections .",
    "the data used in the fit are @xmath7 from zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite together with @xmath7 , @xmath8  @xcite and @xmath9  @xcite from fixed target experiments .",
    "also included were neutrino data on @xmath10  @xcite for @xmath11 and data on the difference @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "after cuts the data cover a kinematic range of @xmath13 , @xmath14  gev@xmath6  and @xmath15  gev@xmath6 .",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 were corrected for nuclear effects using the parameterization of  @xcite for deuterium ( with an assumed uncertainty of 100% ) and that of  @xcite for iron ( assumed uncertainty 50% ) .",
    "the qcd predictions for the structure functions were obtained by solving the qcd evolution equations in nlo in the  scheme  @xcite . at the scale @xmath16  gev@xmath6  the gluon density ( @xmath17 ) , the sea and valence quark densities ( @xmath18 ) and the difference @xmath12 were parameterized in the standard way  @xcite ( 16 free parameters ) .",
    "the strange quark density was taken to be a fraction @xmath19 of the sea  @xcite .",
    "the normalizations of the parton densities were constrained such that the momentum sum rule and the valence quark counting rules are satisfied .",
    "the charm and bottom quarks were assumed to be massless and were generated dynamically above the thresholds @xmath20 and @xmath21  gev@xmath6  respectively .",
    "the value of the strong coupling constant was set to @xmath22 .",
    "higher twist contributions to @xmath7 and @xmath8 were taken into account phenomenologically by describing these structure functions as @xmath23\\ ] ] where @xmath24 obeys the nlo qcd evolution equations and where @xmath25 was parameterized as a fourth degree polynomial in @xmath0 ( 5 free parameters ) .",
    "the normalizations of the zeus , h1 and nmc data were kept fixed to unity whereas those of the remaining data sets were allowed to float within the quoted normalization errors ( 7 parameters ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the parton densities , structure functions and related cross sections were estimated taking into account all correlations . included in the error calculation",
    "are the experimental statistical errors , 57 independent sources of systematic uncertainty ( propagated using the technique described in  @xcite ) and the errors on the input parameters of the fit .",
    "the fit yielded a good description of the data with a @xmath26 of 1540 for 1578 data points and 28 free parameters .",
    "the quality of the fit is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2pvsq ] where we show the fixed target @xmath7 data for @xmath11 .",
    "the higher twist coefficient @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : htwist ] ) is found to be negative for @xmath27 and becomes large and positive at high @xmath0 .",
    "our result on the higher twist contribution is very close to that obtained by mrst  @xcite .",
    "nuclear effects in neutrino scattering were investigated by calculating the ratios @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the ccfr data to the qcd predictions of scattering on a free nucleon .",
    "both these ratios do not significantly depend on @xmath1 in accordance with measurements of nuclear effects in muon scattering  @xcite .",
    "the ratios , averaged over @xmath1 , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuceff ]    and show the typical @xmath0 dependence of nuclear effects , including the rise at large @xmath0 due to fermi motion .",
    "however , within the present accuracy it is not possible to establish whether these nuclear effects are significantly different from those measured in charged lepton scattering ( full curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuceff ] ) .      are shown the parton densities obtained from the qcd fit ( full curves ) .",
    "we have verified that the strange quark density is compatible with the measurements from ccfr  @xcite and also that the qcd prediction of @xmath30 agrees well with the zeus data  @xcite above @xmath31  gev@xmath6 .",
    "this supports the assumption made in this analysis that , at least for @xmath32 , quark mass effects do not spoil the qcd extrapolations to large @xmath1 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : allpdf ] are the parton densities from cteq4 and cteq5  @xcite .",
    "there is , within errors , good agreement between these results and the qcd fit , although both the present analysis and cteq5 yield a slightly harder @xmath33 density than cteq4 .",
    "bodek and yang  @xcite also obtain a harder @xmath34 density by modifying cteq4 ( where the ratio @xmath35 as @xmath36 ) such that @xmath37 they find @xmath38 which implies that @xmath39 as @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath40 ratio is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dou ] .",
    "it is seen that the result from the qcd fit with @xmath41 ( full curve ) is for @xmath42 close to the modified cteq4 distribution with @xmath43 ( dotted curve ) ; if we leave @xmath44 a free parameter in the fit , we obtain @xmath45 ( statistical error ) , close to zero . in any case",
    ", the large error band clearly indicates that the exact behavior of @xmath40 at large @xmath0 is not well constrained .",
    "it might go to zero ( cteq ) , to a constant ( bodek and yang ) or may even diverge ( this analysis ) as @xmath46 .",
    "the cc @xmath47 cross section is predominantly sensitive to the @xmath48 quark density @xmath49 where @xmath50 with @xmath51 the @xmath3 center of mass energy ( @xmath5210@xmath53  gev@xmath6  at hera ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ]    we show the zeus measurements  @xcite of the cc @xmath4 single differential cross sections @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56  gev@xmath6 , normalized to the nlo predictions calculated with the cteq4 parton distribution set .",
    "the full ( dotted ) curves correspond to the predictions from the qcd fit ( cteq5 ) which both achieve a better description of the data at large @xmath1 and @xmath0 due to an improved determination of the @xmath48 quark density .",
    "sm predictions of the @xmath4 nc cross sections , calculated with the parton densities obtained in this analysis , also agree very well with the recent zeus data  @xcite ( not shown ) .",
