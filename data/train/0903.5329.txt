    "`` ultraluminous x - ray sources '' ( ulxs ) are variable x - ray sources in external galaxies with luminosities ( if the emission is isotropic ) greatly exceeding those of galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "the irregular variability , observed on time scales from tenths of seconds to years , suggests that ulxs are binary systems containing a compact object .",
    "the compact objects in these binaries are either stellar - mass black holes in an unusual state with very high accretion rates or intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "it is of significant interest to determine the nature of the compact objects in ulxs .    beyond the luminosities ,",
    "there are two lines of x - ray evidence suggesting that ulxs harbor intermediate mass black holes : x - ray spectral evidence for accretion disks cooler than those in stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries @xcite and quasiperiodic oscillations ( qpos ) at lower frequencies than found in stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries at similar luminosities @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently found that the putative cool disk in one ulx , ngc 1313 x-2 , does not follow the relation that the luminosity is proportional to temperature to the fourth power , @xmath4 , as expected for accretion disk emission , ruling out this interpretation for that source .",
    "this finding casts doubt on the x - ray spectral evidence at least for that source .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray timing evidence appears robust with the qpo frequencies following the relations found in x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "qpos have been definitively detected from only two ulxs : one in m82 and ngc 5408 x-1 @xcite .",
    "further , ngc 5408 x-1 is surrounded by a powerful radio nebula @xcite which requires an extremely energetic outflow from the compact object .",
    "ngc 5408 x-1 is one of the best intermediate mass black hole candidates amongst the ulxs .",
    "optical spectroscopy of ulxs provides , perhaps , the best means to better understand the nature of the ulxs .",
    "indeed , the most definitive constraint on the compact object mass would come from optical measurement of the mass function of the companion star .",
    "the ulx in m82 may lie in a superstar cluster and , in any event , lies in too crowded and obscured a region to permit extraction of an optical spectrum of the ulx binary @xcite .",
    "in contrast , ngc 5408 x-1 lies in a relatively uncrowded region and is only weakly obscured .",
    "we recently identified the optical counterpart to ngc 5408 x-1 @xcite .",
    "thus , ngc 5408 x-1 is the best intermediate mass black hole candidate ulx for which optical spectroscopy of the binary system can be performed .",
    "optical emission can arise from a companion star , an accretion disk surrounding the compact object , or a surrounding nebula .",
    "if the light arises from the companion star , then one would expect continuum emission and , for most spectral types , a series of absorption lines .",
    "measurement of the continuum shape would help constrain the spectral type of the companion star .",
    "detection of spectral lines from the companion star would enable us to determine the star s spectral type , thereby constraining the evolutionary history of the binary .",
    "repeated observations would enable measurement of the mass function and a lower bound on the compact object mass .",
    "if the optical emission arises from the accretion disk , then we would expect to see a blue or hot continuum and emission lines .",
    "high - excitation lines , particularly heii , would give direct information about the nature of the accretion flow and the incident x - ray flux .",
    "these lines can provide information about the nature of the binary system and an estimate of the true x - ray luminosity .",
    "in addition , since the accretion disk moves with the compact object , the emission line radial velocity represents the radial velocity of the compact object and thus provides a means to constrain the mass of the compact object .",
    "this technique was demonstrated by @xcite for the persistent black hole candidate lmc x-1 .",
    "if the optical light arises from a surrounding nebula then the nebula could be either shock - powered , in which case low excitation lines would be expected , or x - ray photoionized , in which case high excitation lines would be expected .",
    "forbidden lines can produced in a photoionized nebula but not in the high densities of an accretion disk .",
    "nebulae may also produce continuum emission .",
    "we obtained several observations of ngc 5408 x-1 using the fors instrument on the vlt and analyzed archival x - ray data from xmm - newton .",

    "the very large telescope ( vlt ) was used for the observations because of the dimness of the optical counterpart of ngc 5408 x-1 , @xmath7 , and the need to obtain moderately high resolution spectra .",

    "we chose to use the focal reducer and spectrograph 1 ( * ? ? ?",

    "we used the gris_600b grism which covers a wavelength range of 3350    to 6330    with a dispersion of 0.75   / pixel and a spectral resolution of @xmath8 at the central wavelength .",
    "we used a @xmath9 slit and 2@xmath62 binning of the pixels with high gain readout and standard resolution .",
    "the spectrograph slit was oriented so that the closest neighbors of the ulx counterpart are best separated along the slit .",
    "the slit also covered a bright star , ` star a ' , that appears in the 2mass catalog @xcite at a position of @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( j2000 ) . since the ulx optical counterpart is quite dim , star a was used for acquisition .",

    "the optical counterpart of ngc 5408 x-1 identified in @xcite appears to be well placed in the slit .",
    "multiple observations of ngc 5408 x-1 were obtained over three successive nights , see table  [ obstable ] .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) @xcite . starting with the raw data , we created bias and lamp flat - field images using exposures obtained on the 3 nights of observations .",
    "these corrections were applied to the spectrum images . each observation block ( ob ) consisted of three integrations of 850  s each with an offset of 12 pixels along the spatial axis between successive integrations .",
    "we analyzed the data by combining the 3 two - dimensional spectra in each observation block in order to remove bad pixels and cosmic ray hits .",
    "we used the xregister task in iraf to caculate the offsets needed to align the images and then the imcombine task to average the images , applying the ccdclip method to remove cosmic rays and bad pixels .",
    "we also combined the entire set of 18 spectra into one using the same procedure .",
    "the dimness of the continuum emission from the optical counterpart of the ulx made finding a trace of the spectrum unreliable .",
    "instead , we first traced the spectrum of star a and then used that as a reference for the trace of the ulx spectrum . the trace position on the spatial axis varied by less than 0.5 pixels along the length of the dispersion axis",
    "the trace for the ulx counterpart was centered using the profile of the heii @xmath04686 emission line .",
    "wavelength lamp and standard star ( eg247 ) spectra were used to wavelength and flux calibrate the spectra .",
    "extinction corrections were applied using the ctio extinction tables available in iraf .",
    "the spectra were searched for emission and absorption lines using the splot task in iraf .",
    "a number of emission lines , discussed below were found .",
    "no stellar absorption lines were detected .",
    "there are some weak absorption features that are due to subtraction of night sky background lines at 5580    and just above the he i line at 5885   .",
    "the latter night sky line makes measurement of the he i @xmath05876 flux unreliable .",
    "after correction for the redshift of ngc 5408 , @xmath12 , the lines are all within 1    of the expected values except for [ nev ] @xmath03426 which differs by 3   .",
    "however , [ nev ] is at a shorter wavelength than the shortest available in the wavelength calibration lamp spectra , 3650   , and we believe that the offset is due to extrapolation of the calibration .      to determine the spectrum of x - rays from the ulx , we extracted the longest publicly available observation of ngc 5408 from the xmm - newton archive .",
    "the observation was performed on jan 13 , 2006 and had a duration of 133  ks @xcite .",
    "we performed the standard xmm data filtering , including removal of data from times when background flares were present using sas version 8.0.0 .",
    "we selected only single pixel events in order to obtain the best energy resolution , since adequate photon statistics were available , and binned the x - ray spectrum in the 0.39.55  kev band to have at least 25 counts per bin .",
    "we fitted the spectrum using xspec version 12.5.0 .",
    "following @xcite , we chose to use a comptonization model , compps @xcite , including multicolor blackbody emission from an accretion disk because we must extrapolate the x - ray spectrum to energies below the minimum observed x - ray energy in order to provide a useful input to the photoionization modeling described below .",
    "we used the tbabs model to account for interstellar absorption along the line of sight .",
    "we found evidence for an emission line or the combination of a unresolved group of emission lines near 0.9  kev and included a gaussian to fit that component .",
    "our best fitted model gave a @xmath13 of 243.2 for 219 degrees of freedom with a column density @xmath14 , an inner disk temperature @xmath15 , and a comptonization electron temperature of @xmath16 and optical depth of @xmath17 .",
    "we note that the electron temperature and optical depth depend on the specific geometry and form of the electron distribution used .",
    "the gaussian emission had a centroid of @xmath18 , a width of @xmath19 , and an equivalent width of 31  ev .",
    "this emission component may represent a thermal plasma , as previously suggested for this source @xcite and also seen from some other ulxs @xcite .",
    "however , using the apec thermal plasma model instead of the single gaussian produces a worse fit , @xmath13 of 263.3 for 219 degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , interpretation of the line is not clear and higher resolution spectra will likely be required to understand the origin of the emission .",
    "correcting for absorption and integrating the model from 1  ev to 100  kev , the total luminosity is @xmath20 .",
    "we note that our x - ray and optical observations are not simultaneous ; they are separated by two years",
    ". however , ngc 5408 x-1 does not appear to be highly variable in x - rays .",

    "there are powerful radio nebulae associated with both ulxs @xcite , while lmc x-1 is radio quiet @xcite .",

    "the relation between heii luminosity and the total luminosity of the ionizing x - ray / uv radiation is not sensitive to metallicity or density as long as the density is high enough that the region of fully ionized he is contained within the simulated nebula and the density is not so high that there is strong absorption of heii @xmath04686 within the nebula . from the measured heii luminosity for ob4 ,",

    "use of the [ nev ] luminosity produces similar conclusions , but they are a bit less certain due to the influence of metallicity .    a _ cloudy _ simulation with a density of @xmath50 , an input x - ray luminosity of @xmath51 , and a metallicity of @xmath52 produced results that matched the data for ob4 reasonably well . in particular , the [ o iii ] line ratio , @xmath53 .",

    "all of these are close to the observed values for ob4 .",
    "the ratio heii / h@xmath31 = 0.52 is somewhat higher than observed because our simulated nebula does not cover the full hii region .",
    "we note that the observed h@xmath31 and [ o iii ] emission is offset from the continuum emission , while the heii emission is reasonably well centered on the continuum .",
    "thus , while our _ cloudy _ simulation is likely a reasonable approximation to the geometry of the high excitation regions of the nebula , it does not adequately describe the more extended , low excitation parts of the nebula .",
    "therefore , while the simulation results regarding the heii and [ nev ] fluxes are likely robust , the results regarding the low excitation lines may be dependent on the geometry of the nebula .",
    "high resolution imaging of the nebula in several emission lines will be necessary to understand its structure in detail .",

    "compared with a power - law fitted to the data in the 4000 - 6000    band , the continuum spectrum , see fig .",

    "the nebular continuum matches the enhancement across the balmer edge reasonably well .",
    "the excess in the subtracted flux just longward of the balmer edge is likely due to high order lines in the balmer series that the line removal procedure applied to the optical data does not successfully identify and remove .",
    "we fitted the continuum after nebular subtraction with a power - law in the 4000 - 6000    band .",

    "the fitted flux is @xmath57@xmath58 at 4300    and @xmath59@xmath58 at 5500   .",
    "these translate to johnson - cousins magnitudes of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the latter value is in reasonable agreement with that found from hst images of the counterpart , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray to optical flux ratio , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the x - ray flux density in @xmath64jy after correction for absorption , is @xmath65 at 2  kev and @xmath66 at 0.5  kev .",
    "as noted above , our x - ray and optical observations are separated by 2 years .",
    "however , since the observed x - ray variability of ngc 5408 x-1 is relatively modest , see  [ xray ] , the induced uncertainty in @xmath67 is only 0.3 .",
    "these values of @xmath67 are similar to those found for those low - mass x - ray binaries where the optical spectra are dominated by reprocessing of x - rays in the outer accretion disk @xcite . the spectral shape , a power - law with a spectral index is close to @xmath68 , is also similar to x - ray binaries where the optical light is primarily due to reprocessed x - rays .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of the light from the optical companion may arise from reprocessing in the disk .",
    "we fitted the x - ray and optical data simultaneously with the irradiated disk model of @xcite , diskir .",
    "we first used the cloudy simulation based on the x - ray spectrum modeled with compps to estimate the nebular optical continuum .",
    "we then fitted the x - ray and optical nebula - subtracted continuum emission data with the diskir model .",
    "we then ran cloudy again , using this initial set of diskir model parameters .",
    "we used this second cloudy run to , again , estimate the nebular optical continuum ; this is the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ contcloud ] .",
    "we then performed the nebula subtraction and fitted the x - ray and optical data with the diskir model a second time .",
    "the parameters from the second iteration of cloudy are very similar to those of the first iteration .",
    "the ratio of heii luminosity to bolometric luminosity of the compact object agrees within 5% and the other line fluxes agree within 20% .",
    "our best fitted irradiated disk model gave a @xmath13 of 278.7 for 258 degrees of freedom with a column density @xmath69 , an inner disk temperature @xmath70 , an asymptotic photon index of @xmath71 , an electron temperature of @xmath72 , and a ratio of compton to disk luminosity of @xmath73 .",
    "the fraction of the compton tail thermalized in the disk was fixed at 0.1 .",
    "the irradiated portion of the disk had an outer radius of @xmath74 , in units of the inner disk radius , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the compact object mass .",
    "the irradiated disk thermalized a fraction of the bolometric luminosity @xmath77 . correcting for absorption and integrating the model from 0.1  ev to 100  kev ,",
    "the total luminosity is @xmath78 . as for the comptonized disk model ,",
    "the irradiated disk model required addition of a gaussian near 0.92  kev to produce an adequate fit .",
    "we note that the x - ray and optical observations were not simultaneous .",
    "we redid the fits with the optical fluxes reduced by 30% and the only significant change in the parameters was a reduction of @xmath79 to @xmath80 .    the fact that the optical continuum is well described by a model of the irradiated outer parts of a standard geometrically thin",
    ", optically thick accretion disk raises confidence in the application of standard accretion disk models to the spectra of ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "the fraction of the total luminosity thermalized in the outer disk is higher than seen from stellar - mass x - ray binaries in the soft or ` thermal dominant ' spectral state , but is within in the range seen in states where a sizable fraction of the emission arises from the comptonized component @xcite .",
    "the spectral state of ngc 5408 x-1 would be classified as the ` steep power - law state ' on the basis of the energy spectrum and the presence of qpos in the classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to study reprocessing in stellar - mass x - ray binaries in similar states , in which a moderately soft power - law component supplies significant flux , to allow a direct comparison . from the best fit value found for the outer radius of the irradiated disk",
    ", we calculate an orbital velocity at the outer edge of the disk of 1200  km / s .",
    "this is larger than the measured width of the heii emission line , which must arise at least in part from reprocessing since it is variable .",
    "these results may suggest that we view the disk close to face - on .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the cool temperatures derived from standard disk models applied to ulx spectra have been interpreted as evidence for intermediate mass black holes @xcite , but the validity of such models have been ruled out for some sources @xcite .",
    "the alternative is that the sources are stellar mass black holes with super - eddington accretion rates . in the so - called ` slim disk ' models of super - eddington accretion flows ,",
    "the disk surface is convex causing the outer disk to be shielded from the luminous portions of the inner disk @xcite .",
    "thus , the fraction of the apparent luminosity that irradiates the outer disk is much lower than for a standard thin disk .",
    "super - eddington accretion may , instead , cause the ejection of mass leading to a wind that reprocesses the hard spectrum of radiation from the inner part of the disk into a softer spectrum @xcite .",
    "the outer parts of the disk would then see this softer spectrum , that we measure to have a characteristic temperature near 0.16  kev .",
    "such soft x - rays do not thermalize in the disk and , thus , do not contribution significantly to the reprocessed emission in the 40006000  band @xcite .",
    "such accretion flows would thermalize only a very small fraction of the apparent luminosity in the outer disk .",
    "the measured ratio of optical to x - ray flux for ngc 5408 x-1 is larger than would be expected in models of super - eddington accretion flows , but is in the range expected from a standard thin disk .",
    "further observations of the continuum emission from ngc 5408 x-1 would allow us to better constrain the properties of the irradiated disk .",
    "simultaneous measurement of the optical and x - ray spectrum would provide a better constraint on the thermalized radiation fraction .",
    "extension of the optical coverage into the ir would enable measurement of the roll over of the irradiated spectrum to a rayleigh - jeans spectrum . from our best",
    "fitted irradiated disk model , this should occur at roughly 1  @xmath64 m .",
    "extension of the optical coverage into the uv could enable measurement of the long wavelength tail of the direct disk emission .",
