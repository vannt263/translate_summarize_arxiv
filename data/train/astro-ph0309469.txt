    "we recently presented an expanded spectroscopic database for 215 low-@xmath4  agn ( marziani et al .",
    "the moderate s / n and resolution spectra cover the rest frame region @xmath1 43005300  .",
    "our expanded sample allows us to address a number of rl issues that have been much discussed recently .",
    "we note that data with lower resolution or s / n _ can not _ address these issues in an eigenvector 1 ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000ab ) context because the uncertainties in line parameter measures will blur the trends that we find .",
    "an important issue involves claims that a radio - loud ( rl ) vs radio - quiet ( rq ) dichotomy does _ not _ exist ( e.g. white et al . 2000 , cirasuolo et al .",
    "2003 ) in measures of radio strength ( i.e. radio power or radio / optical flux ratio ) .",
    "if distinct rq and rl populations exist , quasar samples that use a radio selection criterion ( e.g. first ) will be biased toward the bright end of the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) for rq quasars .",
    "therefore a distribution of radio strength measures may not appear bimodal but simply with a small rl bump on the wing of the rq source distribution .",
    "however , even if the distribution is not intrinsically bi - modal , and rq and rl sources show a smooth , partly overlapping rlf , the rl / rq dichotomy is appreciable in other properties .",
    "there are two alternate approaches which may provide a much clearer answer to the issue of rq - rl bimodality ; ( 1 ) the eigenvector 1 ( e1 ) parameter space ( sulentic et al .",
    "2000a , b ) , and ( 2 ) considerations of radio source morphology in a classical unification scenario .",
    "the e1 diagram has the advantage that and fwhm  are not strongly dependent on luminosity up to at least m@xmath5= -26 ( marziani et al . 2003a ; correlation coefficients are @xmath60.1 ) .",
    "therefore we can reasonably compare rq and rl subsamples with different luminosity distributions in this parameter plane .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution in the optical e1 plane for all sources in our sample with log @xmath71.0 ( where is the radio / optical flux ratio as defined in kellermann et al .",
    "the bulk of our rl sources are concentrated in the region we call population b. our rl sample is  unedited \" and therefore shows a few sources with @xmath70.4 .",
    "these sources involve : ( 1 ) our noisiest spectra , ( 2 ) sources with extremely broad and very low ew h@xmath8  broad component [ w ( ) @xmath020  ] with a high upper limit for , ( 3 ) a few luminous radio core - dominated sources ( circled ) that appear to be genuinely  strong and rl .",
    "the bulk of rl sources are restricted to the parameter ranges 3000@xmath9fwhm ( ) @xmath910000  and 0@xmath9@xmath90.4 .",
    "can the rl occupation in e1 be ascribed to sample selection effects ?",
    "systematic differences in fwhm  between low redshift rq and rl agn are confirmed in samples where @xmath4  and apparent magnitude distributions are matched ( marziani et al .",
    "perhaps a large population of rl sources that will fill in e1 remains to be discovered , at least to the point of removing any difference in domain space occupation .",
    "while our sample is incomplete , it is certainly sampling a significant fraction of both rl and rq sources brighter than v=16.5 ( see figure 2 in marziani et al .",
    "it is unlikely that we have missed a major rl population with significantly different properties . at the same time , growing samples of narrow line seyfert 1 sources ( e.g. grupe et al .",
    "1999 ) ( we would call them extreme rq pop .",
    "a ) contain almost no rl sources ( see later discussion ) .",
    "the different rl domain space occuption in e1 argues in favor of a rl - rq bimodality .",
    "figure 1 gives us more information because we have also examined the radio morphologies of all sources in our sample with log @xmath61.0 .",
    "the characteristic radio morphology of a classical rl source involves double - lobed structure centered on a host galaxy ( at low redshift ) showing broad nuclear emission lines that mark it as hosting a type 1 agn . whether the central host can be seen or not , varying degrees of core radio emission are seen between the double lobes with jet structure often connecting core and lobes .",
    "double lobed morphology in the context of type 1 agn usually means fanaroff - riley ( 1974 ) class ii sources ( frii ) .",
    "we identify 39 frii sources in our rl sample ( 7 are technically hymor following gopal - krishna & wiita 2000 ) .",
    "this is somewhat more than half of our rl sample ( 62 with log @xmath72.0 ) .",
    "the remaining rl sources in our sample show core or core - jet radio structure . in a classical morphology unification scenario",
    "they are interpreted as double - lobed sources aligned to within @xmath125@xmath10 of our line of sight . in order to keep our definitions simple",
    "our core - dominated ( cd ) sources show no evidence for double - lobed structure in any published radio map ( this will depend on the spatial frequency sensitivity and dynamic range of available maps ) .",
    "we interpret frii sources as the parent population of rl agn .",
    "they are shown as open circles in figure 1 and the vast majority show a strong concentration in the population b domain of e1 .",
    "these are unambiguously rl sources and all show log @xmath111.8we find three additional frii sources with 1.8@xmath9log @xmath92.0 . until weaker frii sources are found we adopt log @xmath01.8 as the lower limit for classical rl sources ( the three open circles with log @xmath71.0 on the right side of figure 1 will likely move into the pop .",
    "b region with better data ) .",
    "we make this statement because the cd rl analogues to the frii sources are interpreted as preferentially aligned sources .",
    "their lobe / jet axis should be aligned within a few degrees to our line of sight .",
    "one observes rapid variability at many wavelengths , apparent superluminal motion in the radio structure and doppler boosting of the continuum emission ( even swamping the emission lines in blazars ) .",
    "the latter effect is most relevant here , because in the simplest unification the cd rl sources should all be doppler boosted . while the frii sources will be unboosted or less boosted than cd sources .",
    "the same source viewed pole - on will show a larger  value ( dependent on the boosting factor , ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 ) than when viewed lobe - on .",
    "cd sources with log  @xmath72.0 are marked as filled squares in figure 1 .",
    "median log  values for our frii and cd subsamples are 2.7 and 3.0 respectively with large scatter . the restricted domain space occupation for rl sources ,",
    "compared to rq sources , in e1 is perhaps the strongest argument for interpreting rl sources as being fundamentally different from the rq majority of type 1 agn . at the very least",
    "it implies that they are , in some sense , an extremum in a continuous sequence of type 1 agn broad line region ( blr ) properties .",
    "figure 1 provides even more information because we can now compare frii and cd domain occupation with predictions of the favored models for low ionization broad ( including balmer ) line emission .",
    "our e1 motivated working hypothesis has been that : ( 1 ) highly accreting ( as supported by e1 parameters involving a  blueshift and a soft x - ray excess ) , low black hole ( bh ) mass population a sources ( sulentic et al . 2000b , marziani et al .",
    "2001 , 2003b ) show balmer and  emission from an accretion disk , while , ( 2 ) the larger bh masses and lower accretion rates estimated for rl + pop b rq sources ( marziani et al .",
    "2001 , 2003b ) coupled with the absence of a  blueshift and soft x - ray excess implied different disk / wind properties , and probably a single emitting region ( marziani et al .",
    "claims of no rl - rq mass difference ( e.g. oshlack et al .",
    "2002 ) may reflect smaller measured fwhm values resulting from nonsubtraction of a narrow component from the balmer lines ",
    "@xmath12@xmath13[fwhm()]@xmath14 .",
    "we have suggested that the stronger balmer line and weaker  emission from pop . b rl and rq sources might be ascribed to thermal gas entrained along the jet axis ( i.e. , a bicone ) . in a bicone",
    "dominated emission line scenario we would expect to see the broadest balmer profiles in sources oriented near pole - on .",
    "a model viewing line emission from an accretion disk would make the opposite prediction the balmer lines would be narrowest for near face - on oriented cd sources ( see also wills & browne 1986 ) .",
    "we would also expect stronger  emission from a line emitting disk when it is viewed face - on ( marziani et al .",
    "we would therefore expect rl cd sources to be displaced towards lower fwhm ( ) and larger  in a disk scenario .",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that a disk model is favored since most cd sources are found at the lower edge of the frii distribution and displaced towards slightly higher average .",
    "e1 has enabled us to isolated the parent frii rl population and to estimate the role of source orientation in driving rl source occupation .",
    "we find a domain space separation between frii and cd sources in e1 .",
    "following the same line of reasoning we can examine the superluminal sources in our sample .",
    "jet orientation can be inferred from radio observations that allow estimation of the synchrotron self compton flux relative to the observed x - ray flux ( ghisellini et al . 1993 ) . using the same reasoning , rokaki et al ( 2003 ) compared",
    "fwhm(h@xmath15 ) measures with predictions of jet orientation ( @xmath16 ) and estimated doppler boosting factor ( @xmath17 ) for a sample of superluminal sources .",
    "they find a weak correlation consistent with the notion that the balmer lines arise from an accretion disk whose plane is roughly perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "figure 2 shows our @xmath16  vs fwhm ( ) correlation diagram for 9 superluminal sources in common with rokaki et al .",
    "plus two additional sources from marziani et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "our optical  measures are generally higher resolution and s / n than the ir h@xmath15  measures yielding a lower scatter .",
    "we confirm their conclusion that the correlation is consistent with a disk origin for the bulk of balmer broad line emission and that the correlation is opposite of that expected in a bicone scenario .",
    "the diagonal arrow in figure 1 indicates the average expected change in e1 position due to change in orientation from frii to cd sources .",
    "many of the most extreme boosted sources will be lineless blazars and hence absent from e1 .",
    "it is interesting that bl lac in low phase showed fwhm ( ) @xmath1 4000 , close to the locus of cd points in fig .",
    "1 . note that , in an effort at simplification , we have ignored the radio spectral indices or core / lobe ratio in this paper .",
    "we note that the most extreme source identified as frii in figure 2 ( smallest fwhm and log theta ) is strongly asymmetric and core - dominated .",
    "figure 3 plots  versus the two optical e1 parameters .",
    "we again identify the frii and cd rl populations as in figure 1 .",
    "we extracted 6 cm radio fluxes and optical b magnitudes from veron - cetty et al .",
    "similar distributions are found if ones uses nvss 20 cm fluxes or if one uses radio power instead of  for the abscissa .",
    "the rl source preference for fwhm()@xmath114000 and @xmath90.5 is clearly seen in the plots .",
    "we also see a source deficit between log  = 1.0 and 2.0 .",
    "we do not suggest that this is the distribution that one would expect for any complete sample .",
    "it will never look like this for reasons discussed earlier .",
    "rl sources are clearly overrepresented in our sample for complex reasons .",
    "the focus of interest here involves the most radio ambiguous sources between log r@xmath18=1.0 and 2.0 .",
    "three of them turned out to be frii sources that define our lower boundary for the classical rl sources . in our interpretation ,",
    "cd sources with r@xmath18 less than the weakest observed frii sources have no meaning in a rl classical unification . since all but three intermediate sources ( n=10-marked as filled triangles in figure 1 ) show core structure we interpret their radio emission as unrelated to rl core / lobe emission .",
    "e1 further supports this interpretation because sources with log r@xmath18@xmath191.0 show no domain preference , they are found just as frequently in rq pop a domain as in the pop b domain preferred by rl sources .",
    "we have found a significant number of radio  intermediate \" sources ( @xmath20  @xmath21 ) and seek to account for them .",
    "at least five interpretations can be proposed .",
    "( 1 ) the overlap between the faint end of the rlf for rl sources and the bright end of the rlf for rq sources .",
    "this is supported by the data since three sources show classical frii structure  they are the weakest rl sources in our sample at  @xmath22 .",
    "this is the simplest explanation and is further supported by a study of the 6 - 20 cm spectral indices ( ivezic et al .",
    "2002 ) where it is concluded that almost all low redshift radio - loud agn are likely to show log  @xmath232.0 . assuming a mean value of log  @xmath1 -0.05 for rq sources and a reasonably symmetric distribution about the mean would place the high log r@xmath18  end of the distribution near 0.0 .",
    "explanation 2 can then be helpful here .",
    "( 2 ) mixed starburst / agn sources with radio emission amplified by processes unrelated to the rl jet phenomenon . a good place to look",
    "would be among ulirg sources .",
    "we find many  values between @xmath241.0 with the most extreme sources ( e.g. arp 220 and ngc6240 ) lying between 1.0 - 2.0 .",
    "we can identify 4 objects among our 13 intermediate sources that show an ir excess and are interpreted as mixed agn / starbursts ( mkn231 , iras 0759 + 64 , ngc7674 and mkn 896 ) consistent with enhanced radio emission from activity related to star formation . if a plausible correction ( @xmath25@xmath13.0 ) for internal extinction is applied e.g. to mkn 231 then the observed log  @xmath01.8 will decrease to @xmath00.6 .",
    "most of the remaining 6 intermediate sources are too distant for an iras detection below ulirg level .",
    "( 3 ) a population of rq sources that show weak radio jet structure ( falcke et al .",
    "1996 , 1996 , de diego et al .",
    "1998 , gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2001 , blundell & rawlings 2001 ) .",
    "this represents another method to enhance the radio emission from rq sources .",
    "would it be related or unrelated to classical rl activity ?",
    "the domain occupation in e1 and the lack of double lobed morphology argue  unrelated \" .",
    "( 4 ) population b spiral galaxies that are similar to elliptical hosted rl sources in bh mass , accretion rate , e1 parameters and , consequently , blr structure although with their radio emission beamed but somehow muffled .",
    "this interpretation is clearly related , or even identical , to 3 ; see refs . for 3 ) .",
    "reliable host galaxy morphology only exist for a handful of our sources but at least two known spirals in our sample show true rl ( log  @xmath26 2 ) activity 3c120 ( complex core / jet emission - also called an fri source ) and iii zw 2 .",
    "( 5 ) proto- rl sources which have not yet produced jet / lobe structure and are heavily self absorbed ( odea 1998 ) .",
    "the remaining 6 intermediate sources are more difficult to explain .",
    "if we interpret these cd sources as classical rl agn then they should be oriented with the jet axis near our line - of - sight and consequently beamed ( doppler boosted )",
    ". such low  values for boosted sources would imply an un - beamed parent population that is unambiguously rq .",
    "one does not observe classical double - lobed sources in rq samples ( kellermann et al . 1994 , kukula et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the intermediate sources show population b properties with mean fwhm()@xmath1 8800 , and @xmath10.3 .",
    "these sources deserve further study in order to see if they conform to any of the possible explanations proposed above .",
    "have we so far missed many radio intermediate sources in our growing sample ?",
    "the simplest reason would be if a class of low redshift intermediate radio emitters was shown to be optically fainter on average than low redshift populations of rq and rl sources .",
    "one must be careful here because any optical dimming will tend to enhance rather than diminish . that would point toward a rq parent population for the dimmed sources by the same argument that radio weak / intermediate cd sources viewed as beamed sources , imply a weaker ( i.e. rq ) parent population .",
    "we note that 3 nlsy1 galaxies ( not part of our sample ) with log  @xmath1 1.4 , 1.5 and 1.8 ( remillard et al .",
    "1986 ; siebert et al . 1999 ; grupe et al .",
    "2000 ) have been proposed as cd rl sources .",
    "they would fall in the ( population a ) intermediate region of figure 1 where rl sources are rare .",
    "they do not fit in a classical rl unification scheme but may be candidate beamed rq sources .",
    "pks2004 - 447 ( oshlack et al . 2001 ) shows narrow balmer lines and no emission and is probably a type 2 agn .",
    "as far as we are aware zhou et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found the first genuinely rl nlsy1 source ( log @xmath73.0)it would fit with the three  strong cd sources circled in figure 1 .",
    "we find that : ( 1 ) e1 parameters support some kind of dichotomy between rl and rq agn , ( 2 ) sources with different radio morphology occupy different regions of the e1 parameter space supporting the unification assumption that true rl cd sources can be interpreted as almost face - on frii s and ( 3 ) e1 occupation , and comparison of superluminal source orientation estimates with e1 parameters , suggest that a significant part of the balmer and  emission arises in an accretion disk .",
    "the latter result suggests that the rl - rq dichotomy may be more related to evolution than to fundamentally different blr structure .",
