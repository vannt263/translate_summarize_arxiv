    "the importance of understanding the relationships between rotational velocity , evolutionary status and stellar temperature in causing the the be phenomenon has long been understood ( slettebak @xcite ) .",
    "recently zorec & briot ( @xcite ) presented evidence based on a careful evaluation of the statistics of b and be stars in the bright star catalogue ( hoffleit & jaschek @xcite ) that after correction for various selection effects there were no apparent differences in the spectral type distribution and frequency of be stars with respect to luminosity class .",
    "in addition they showed the shape of the @xmath0 distribution with spectral type was not luminosity dependant , implying little or uniform angular momentum loss from such objects over their lifetimes . here",
    "we extend that work by using the sample of steele et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to quantify the evolution of angular momentum between the dwarf and giant stages of be stars .",
    "we show that either conservation of angular momentum or an accumulated loss of up to ( but no more than ) 15% of the stellar angular momentum is allowed during the main sequence + giant lifetime of be stars .",
    "in steele et al . ( @xcite ) we presented optical spectra of a sample of 58 be stars .",
    "the sample contains objects from o9 to b8.5 and of luminosity classes iii ( giants ) to v ( dwarfs ) , as well as three shell stars ( which we neglect for the purposes of this paper as they have uncertain luminosity classes ) . a spectral type and value of @xmath0",
    "was derived for each object in the sample .",
    "the sample is termed a `` representative '' sample , in that it was selected in an attempt to contain several objects that were typical of each spectral and luminosity class in the above range .",
    "it therefore does _ not _ reflect the spectral and luminosity class space distribution of be stars , but only the average properties of each subclass in temperature and luminosity .",
    "the distributions of @xmath0 within each temperature and luminosity class were carefully investigated and the conclusion drawn that there were no significant selection effects biasing the average properties of the objects .",
    "however it was apparent that for all spectral sub - types the giants had significantly lower values of @xmath0 than the dwarfs .",
    "# 1#20.8#1    ( 3.0,6.1)(0,0 ) ( -0.0,-0.0 )      in fig .",
    "1 we plot the binned distribution of @xmath0 values for the sample for luminosity classes iii , iv and v. the data have been binned into bins of width 80 km / s , chosen to be considerably larger than the mean error on any one @xmath0 measurement , which is @xmath3 km / s .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the distributions are different , with the giants having considerably lower @xmath0 than the dwarfs .",
    "a simple explanation of this would be that the critical velocity for giants is lower than that for dwarfs , so that the @xmath0 may be lower but still give a sufficiently high @xmath4 to cause a disk to form . to investigate this we plot in fig .",
    "2 the @xmath2 distributions for our sample .",
    "we calculated @xmath5 according to the prescription given by porter ( @xcite ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the polar radius .",
    "values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 were obtained from schmidt - kaler ( @xcite ) , with interpolation between luminosity classes and spectral sub - types where necessary . from fig .",
    "2 it is apparent that this simple explanation of the necessity of a certain fractional velocity to give the be phenomenon is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between the giants and dwarfs .    # 1#20.8#1    ( 3.0,6.1)(0,0 ) ( -0.0,-0.0 )      we now consider the rotational velocity changes that result from angular momentum conservation during the evolution from dwarfs to giants . assuming that the mass of a given star is fixed during this evolution and that angular momentum is conserved , then velocity @xmath9 will simply be inversely proportional to radius @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity we therefore consider is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fractional radius for luminosity class compared to the corresponding giant radius . from schmidt - kaler ( @xcite ) it is apparent that for dwarfs in the range o9 to b9 for a constant mass ( _ not _ spectral type ) the relationship @xmath12 holds to within @xmath13 per - cent .",
    "similarly for the subdwarfs we adopt @xmath14 .",
    "the ratio is of course unity for the giants .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the distributions of @xmath10 for all three luminosity classes .",
    "the similarity of the three distributions is striking . in order to confirm their similarity we carried out a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test between the unbinned values of @xmath10 for the giants and the dwarfs . as noted in the captions of figs .",
    "1 and 2 the test was also carried out on the @xmath0 and @xmath2 datasets to demonstrate that they were significantly different .",
    "for @xmath10 the probability that the giant and dwarf distributions are drawn from the same population is 0.83 , confirming our opinion of the similarity of the samples , and demonstrating that the similarity was not an effect of our binning the data .",
    "it is therefore apparent that conservation of angular momentum over the be lifetime of the object is entirely consistent with the observed angular momentum distributions .    #",
    "1#20.8#1    ( 3.0,6.1)(0,0 ) ( -0.0,-0.0 )",
    "in sect . 2.3 we demonstrated that angular momentum conservation was consistent with the observed values of @xmath15 .",
    "however it may be that a certain fraction of angular momentum may be lost from the stars and the two distributions still remain consistent . to investigate this we simulated the effect of changing the system angular momentum of the giants by factors of between 0.01 and 2.0 in increments of 0.01 and redoing the ks test .",
    "the resulting distribution of probabilities is shown in fig .",
    "4 .    # 1#20.8#1    ( 3.0,3.3)(0,0 ) ( -0.0,-0.5 )    from fig .",
    "4 it is apparent that a probability of greater than @xmath13% of the two distributions being consistent is obtained for fractional changes of angular momentum during the main sequence + giant lifetime of the star of between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . neglecting the upper value as unphysical we therefore conclude that any method of losing angular momentum that purports to explain the be phenomenon must cause a loss of less than @xmath18 per cent of the stellar angular momentum over the main sequence + giant lifetimes of the star . from the analysis presented by porter ( @xcite ) of the spin down of be stars due to angular momentum transfer to the disk ( i.e. a decretion disk - e.g. lee et al .",
    "1991 ) this implies that ( assuming the be phenomenon is present for most of the main sequence life of the star ) the disks around be stars are in his terminology `` weak '' to `` medium '' .",
    "this means that for a typical disk opening angle of 15@xmath19 and a density of 2@xmath20 g @xmath21 ( waters @xcite ) , the initial outflow velocity must be less than 0.01 km / s . for a decretion disk",
    "this implies the viscosity parameter @xmath22 ( porter @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative of explanation is a much `` stronger '' disk that is only present for short periods during the life of the star .",
    "for example if the disk were only present for 10% of the main - sequence lifetime , then we derive @xmath23 .",
    "by using the distribution of @xmath0 values for giants and dwarfs in the be star sample of steele et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we have shown that any angular momentum loss in the system that would spin down the be stars must cause the loss of no more than 15% of the stellar angular momentum .",
    "this implies that either the be phenomenon is only a short phase in the life of such objects , or that any decretion disk in the system must have a low outflow velocity ( @xmath24 km / s ) and hence a low viscosity ( @xmath25 .",
