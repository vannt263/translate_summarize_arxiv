    "the issue of excitations with quantum numbers @xmath7 @xcite in the energy range between 1 and 2 gev of @xmath0 annihilation still remains , to a large extent , an unresolved one .",
    "are they recurrences of the ground state nonet of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , or do they have an exotic nature @xcite ? in the former case , to",
    "what extent are the flavor su(3 ) predictions good for them ? in the latter case , are they completely exotic , and if not , what is the admixture of the exotic non-@xmath6 component ? to answer these and similar questions , one should extract the masses and coupling constants of bare resonances in order to compare them with various models .",
    "as we have shown earlier @xcite in the case of the vector isovector @xmath11-like excitations , taking into account both the effects of resonance mixing and the fast energy growth of the partial widths of successively opened multiparticle channels affects the specific masses and coupling constants extracted from the data .",
    "the present paper is aimed at extending a similar treatment to the case of vector isoscalar @xmath12 and @xmath13like excitations . to this end",
    "we analyze the data on the reactions @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , allowing for contributions of the @xmath19 @xmath20 resonances , in order to extract the masses and coupling constants of these excitations to various channels .",
    "the main result is that , within very large errors determined by poor data samples , the extracted parameters do not contradict the simple @xmath6 model of the @xmath21- and @xmath22-like resonances .",
    "the magnitudes of the @xmath6 bound state wave function at the origin are extracted from the magnitudes of the leptonic widths , yet the accuracy still does not permit one to verify the traditional @xmath6 assignment @xcite of heavier excitations and to draw any definite conclusions about the interquark potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] contains the expressions for the cross sections and a discussion of the assumptions made about the interaction vertices and the coupling constants .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the presentation of the results of our analysis , which are discussed in sec .",
    "section [ sec5 ] sketches possible further work necessary for the improvement of the situation with excitations with masses above 1 gev .",
    "an exact application of the explicitly unitary method @xcite of taking the mixing of resonances into account is computationally time consuming in the present case , since it demands the inversion of the @xmath23 matrix of inverse propagators whose elements are complex numbers . instead , we take into account the mixing inside each sector , @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 to all orders , while the terms which break the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule are taken into account to first order .",
    "then the cross section of production of the final state @xmath27 in @xmath0 annihilation can be represented as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is the total center - of - mass energy squared , @xmath33 .",

    "the general form of all propagators including the @xmath8 one , @xmath64 , whose imaginary part is determined by the @xmath65 partial width @xmath66 is given in sec .",
    "[ susec2c ] .      before writing down explicit expressions for the various matrix elements entering into the matrices above ,",
    "let us comment on the coupling constants of the vector mesons with various final states @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath67 sector does not contribute by g - parity conservation , and hence @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath69 coupling constant should be inserted in place of @xmath70 . in particular , @xmath71 and",
    "the ozi suppressed coupling constant @xmath72 are determined from fitting the data on the present final state and are kept fixed in fitting the remaining final states .",
    "it should be emphasized that the existing data still can not distinguish between the two mechanisms of the @xmath1 decay of the @xmath10 , namely , a sizable @xmath73 mixing , @xmath74 and the direct transition @xmath75 @xcite . in principle , a careful experimental study of the @xmath73 interference minimum in the reaction @xmath76 could discriminate between the above models @xcite",
    ". however , such subtleties are inessential in the present case , since both models give a similar behavior of the cross section .",
    "so we take here for definiteness the purely @xmath77 quark content of the @xmath10 , thus attributing its @xmath1 decay mode solely to the direct coupling constant @xmath72 .",
    "the masses and coupling constants of the @xmath78 complex extracted from the fit will turn out to be @xmath79 they coincide , within errors , with the parameters obtained earlier @xcite , and so we will not discuss them further . note that we will assume hereafter the quark model relation @xmath80 between the leptonic coupling constants @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the accuracy of existing data in the energy range of @xmath83 is still insufficient ( see below ) for the introduction of the nonzero coupling constants @xmath84 , hence they are fixed to zero , so that the ozi rule breaking in the sectors which include the heavier excitations , is attributed solely to the mixing via the ozi allowed two step processes proceeding through common decay modes",
    ".      the @xmath11-like resonances do not contribute by g - parity conservation , similar to the previous case .",
    "our analysis of pure isovector channels of @xmath0 annihilation @xcite reveals the negligible contribution of the off - mass - shell coupling @xmath85 in the energy range @xmath86 gev .",
    "guided by the planar quark diagram approach , a similar @xmath87 coupling is neglected in the present case .",
    "the coupling constants of the @xmath22-like resonances to the state under consideration are suppressed by the ozi rule and hence can be set to zero , bearing in mind the poor accuracy of the present data .",
    "note also that the @xmath2 mode takes into account effectively the @xmath88 , etc .",
    ", modes . in fact",
    ", the chain @xmath89 includes the decay of the axial @xmath90 whose decay amplitude contains two independent partial waves .",
    "this results , in general , in a structureless angular distribution of final pions and could be modelled by the effective pointlike @xmath2 vertex , which includes also possible intermediate states containing the scalarlike mesons , @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92 coupling constant is expected to be suppressed due to the ozi rule and hence is omitted .",
    "this guess is supported by the fact that the final state @xmath93 is not observed in @xmath0 annihilation @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath11- and @xmath21-like resonances is taken into account via su(3 ) relations for their coupling , assuming a @xmath6 quark content : @xmath94 and the su(2 ) related to the above .",
    "as a further fit shows , @xmath95 and so we will not discuss this coupling constant further anymore .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath11 excitations are chosen as follows .",
    "the analysis @xcite of these excitations gives a number of variants of the best description of the specific final state , and the parameters extracted from various final states agree within errors .",
    "we plot the @xmath96 resonance contribution to the production cross section of the @xmath3 final state and convince ourselves that , surprisingly , the @xmath97 parameters from the variant of the description of the reaction @xmath98 ( with the subtraction of the @xmath99 events ) @xcite falls closer to the data @xcite than other variants do , and by that reason this variant is adopted in the present case , hereafter dubbed the set @xmath100 . in the meantime , another set of the @xmath97 parameters from @xcite is briefly discussed at the proper place below .",
    "this final state originates from the @xmath101 intermediate state , so that the production cross sections are related as @xmath102 , analogously for the charge conjugated states .",
    "hence , the coupling constant @xmath103 should be inserted instead of @xmath104 , and a factor of 1/2 appears in the corresponding expression for @xmath49 .",
    "the coupling constants of the @xmath11-like , @xmath21-like , and @xmath22-like resonances are supposed to obey the @xmath6 model relations @xmath105 and the su(2 ) related to them .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath11-like excitations are the same as for the final state @xmath3 .",
    "the production amplitude of this final state includes , in principle , both the effective pointlike , in the sense explained earlier in the case of the @xmath2 decay channel , @xmath107 , and the triple vector , @xmath108 , vertices .",
    "the latter is the su(3 ) related to the vertex @xmath109 .",
    "it was shown earlier @xcite , that the contribution of the @xmath110 tail is negligible at @xmath111 gev , while the @xmath112 coupling constants are compatible with zero . guided by su(3 )",
    ", it is reasonable to neglect the triple vector couplings in the present case , too .",
    "note that a zero isospin of the vector mesons involved in the effective pointlike four - particle vertices allows us to relate various charge combinations of pions and kaons , resulting in ratio of the coupling constants : @xmath113 hence , we retain here only the coupling constants @xmath114 , @xmath115 and keep them free .",
    "the @xmath116 couplings contain two isotopic states of the @xmath117 system , @xmath118 .",
    "then the ratios of the coupling constants of the neutral @xmath97 states to various @xmath119 charge states are expressed through the coupling constants @xmath120 with definite isospin according to @xmath121 and the charge conjugated to the above .",
    "these couplings were neglected in @xcite . in principle , they should be included in the future , after obtaining good consistent data on various channels . in the following analysis of the final states containing strange mesons",
    ", we will set upper bounds on the @xmath122 couplings with definite isospin of the @xmath123 states .",
    "the propagator of the bare vector meson @xmath58 and the imaginary part of the nondiagonal polarization operator describing the mixing between the bare states @xmath44 and @xmath44 ( @xmath124 ) are , respectively , @xmath125 and @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "here the factors of 2 , 4 , and 6 multiplying , respectively , the @xmath128 , @xmath123 , and @xmath119 contributions allow for various charge combinations , taken with the proper su(2 ) coefficients [ see eq . ( [ rel1 ] ) ] , and the phase space factors of different final states are given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.5 ] ) .",
    "the width of the bare state @xmath44 can be represented , in this notation , as @xmath129 the sector @xmath130 was described earlier @xcite . here",
    "we should add the partial width @xmath131 to the full width of the @xmath97 and the contribution @xmath132 to the imaginary part of the nondiagonal polarization operator @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the partial widths could include the energy - dependent factors @xmath134 which , analogously to the well known blatt - weiskopf centrifugal factors , are aimed at restricting a too fast growth of the partial widths with the energy rise .",
    "they are somewhat arbitrary under the demand of @xmath135 const at @xmath136 . in practice , the only mode with a strong dependence is the vector ( v)+pseudoscalar ( p ) one , and our choice for the factor multiplying corresponding coupling constant is @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the mass of the resonance and @xmath139 is the so - called range parameter .",
    "contrary to the imaginary parts fixed by the unitarity relation , the real parts of _ all _ nondiagonal polarization operators can not be evaluated at present and hence should be taken as free parameters .",
    "however , some information about the mass spectrum of the ground state mesons can provide a reasonable guess about the real parts of the nondiagonal polarization operators describing the mixing of the ground state mesons with the heavier ones .",
    "in fact , it was shown earlier @xcite in the case of two mixed states 1 and 2 that the masses of both these states acquire shifts in the opposite directions .",
    "in particular , the shift of the lower state is @xmath140 } , \\label{mshift}\\ ] ] and it can be large .",
    "however , a fit by the minimization of the @xmath141 function fixes only the combination @xmath142 .",
    "hence , it is natural to assume that the dominant contribution to the mass renormalization , eq .",
    "( [ mshift ] ) , coming from @xmath143 is already subtracted , so that the mass of the lower state minimizing @xmath141 differs from the actual position of peak 1 in the cross section by a quantity quadratic in im@xmath144",
    ". then the minimum of @xmath141 is provided by the values of re@xmath144 falling close to zero , of course , with very large error bars .",
    "so it is reasonable to fix the latter to zero from the very start .",
    "these considerations , justifiable in the case of the ground state mesons @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 whose @xmath6 nature is firmly established , can not be applied to the higher excitations .",
    "the latter may contain an appreciable admixture of an exotic component like @xmath145 , @xmath146 , etc .",
    "@xcite , and so it is a matter of principle to extract from the data the parameters of unmixed states . by this reason",
    "the real parts of the nondiagonal polarization operators describing the mixing among heavier excitations should be kept free .",
    "we consider them to be independent of energy .",
    "the procedure of the extraction of the resonance parameters is the same as in @xcite .",
    "we fit the data on each reaction eqs .",
    "( [ dm2_3pi])@xmath147 ( [ dm2_kstkpi ] ) separately , by minimizing the @xmath141 function . in principle , the specific set of parameters giving the best description of the specific cross section unnecessarily gives a good description of other channels .",
    "hence , final choice is made on the demand that the sets of the parameters obtained from various channels should differ by no more than one to two standard deviations .",
    "this looks reasonable , especially if one bears in mind the desirable possibility of gathering good consistent data on different channels and on the single facility .",
    "it should be emphasized that the usual representation of the resonance parameters as masses and partial widths evaluated at these masses is inadequate in the case of strongly mixed resonances and the strong energy dependence of the partial widths .",
    "as will be clear later on , actual peaks in the cross sections are displaced considerably from the input masses of the heavier excitations .",
    "this is the reason for our choice of the masses and _ coupling constants _ of bare states , not their partial widths , to represent the results .",
    "furthermore , a large number of free parameters pushes us to invoke some hypotheses on the relations between the coupling constants .",
    "the assumption adopted in the present paper is the @xmath6 nature of the isoscalar excitations .",
    "corresponding relations among the hadronic coupling constants are given in sec .",
    "[ susec2b ] .",
    "our results are collected in tables [ tab1 ] , [ tab2 ] , and in fig .",
    "[ fig1]@xmath147 [ fig5 ] . in table [ tab3 ] we quote the values of @xmath148 for each channel considered in the work .",
    "it is seen that all the parameters agree within the large error bars .",
    "the range parameter @xmath149 for the @xmath150 decay mode [ and the su(3 ) related to it ] turns out to be @xmath151 in the case of the @xmath9 , and is not fixed by the fit in the case of the @xmath152 .",
    "we choose it to be zero for the latter excitation and for the @xmath153 one , too .",
    "let us comment on the visible disagreements in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "first , the small , compared to the other , value of @xmath154 extracted from the @xmath3 data is an artifact of our particular choice of @xmath97 resonance parameters .",
    "another choice @xcite , with the parameters extracted from the @xmath155 data hereafter dubbed as the set @xmath156 , gives better values , @xmath157 kev and @xmath158 kev .",
    "this emphasizes the necessity of obtaining consistent data about various final states in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "the visible disagreement of the central value of the leptonic width @xmath159 extracted from the reaction ( [ dm2_kstkpi ] ) is due to the following .",
    "first , the error bars are so large that the disagreement is statistically insignificant .",
    "second , the threshold of the reaction , eq .",
    "( [ dm2_kstkpi ] ) , 1.53 gev , is so high that the inclusion of additional multiparticle decay modes may be necessary , which could change the result towards better values .",
    "we postpone this task until more satisfactory experimental data will appear .",
    "notice that the peak positions of the heavier excitations are displaced towards lower values from the bare masses of resonances .",
    "the same phenomenon was observed in the case of isovector excitations @xcite and is due , predominantly , to the growth of the partial widths with the energy , @xmath160    unfortunately , available data do not put any serious restrictions on the real parts of the nondiagonal polarization operators .",
    "the minimization procedure points to possible nonzero values which are quoted in table [ tab2 ] , but the error bars are very large .",
    "the best upper bounds on the @xmath161 couplings @xmath120 with definite isospin of the @xmath123 system are as follows : i ) @xmath162 and @xmath163 come from fitting the cross section of the reaction @xmath164 ; ii ) @xmath165 and @xmath166 come from fitting the cross section of the reaction @xmath167 .",
    "the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) for bound states of light quarks can not be easily justified in view of the expectedly large qcd and relativistic corrections . yet",
    "the remarkable agreement of nrqm predictions with the data in the physics of light quarks is impressive , and by this reason the nrqm provides a conventional reference frame for representing the results of numerous analyses . in particular ,",
    "conclusions about the possible non-@xmath6 component @xcite are based on a comparison of calculations @xcite with the ratios of coupling constants based on the nrqm .",
    "so we also will follow here the custom of expressing the results in terms of the interquark potential , bound state wave functions , etc .",
    ", bearing in mind that the extent of the reliability to the models of such a kind is supported by their effectiveness in known cases rather than by a firm theoretical basis .    as is known , the leptonic widths , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) , are sensitive to the behavior of the wave function of the bound @xmath6 state at the origin @xcite : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the radial wave function at the origin of the @xmath6 bound state with angular momentum @xmath170 .",

    "the results for @xmath11-like excitations are evaluated with the help of @xcite .",
    "one obtains , for the @xmath11-like excitations , @xmath175 to be compared to @xmath176 . as is pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the amplitude of the reaction @xmath167 seems to be affected by the multiparticle intermediate states neglected in the present analysis , and so we exclude it from averaging in the case of the isoscalars .",
    "one gets @xmath177 to be compared to @xmath178 . here",
    "the numbers in the parentheses refer to the set @xmath156 of the parameters of the @xmath11-like excitations mentioned earlier .",
    "note that within error bars the numerical characteristics of the @xmath6 structure of the @xmath11-like and @xmath21-like excitations are coincident , thus supporting their assignment to the same nonet .",
    "a realistic interquark potential could include the sum of a coulomb - like one , with a running qcd coupling constant and a confining potential @xcite .",
    "however , because the errors in extracting the wave functions and second derivatives at the origin are still too large , one can not draw any definite conclusions about the parameters of the potential or to verify the usual assignments @xmath179 and @xmath180 , similar for @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the present study differs basically from that of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the simplest breit - wigner amplitude , with the neglect of mixing among the states , was used for fitting the cross sections .",

    "( [ lepcc ] ) , is fixed here from the very start , while the ratio @xmath181 spreads from zero to 0.3 in all the fits and does not contradict to the @xmath6 ratio @xmath182 .",
    "the vector - pseudoscalar and pseudoscalar- pseudoscalar couplings are also related via the @xmath6 model in our work .",
    "it should be recalled that our previous analysis @xcite revealed the ratio @xmath183 to be consistent with zero .",
    "this is in a contrast with the hypothesis of the hybrid admixture @xcite which predicts the dominance of final states containing the @xmath184 mesons @xcite .",
    "pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar final states appear to be suppressed in our analysis , in qualitative agreement with the considerations of ref .",
    "note , however , that there are reasons to expect the suppression of these final states for pure @xmath6 mesons @xcite .",
    "the data on the isoscalar heavier excitations existing now are still of poor accuracy , not only in that the errors of the extracted parameters of these excitations are large , but in that these data are insufficient to discriminate between possible dynamical models of the resonances with masses greater than 1 gev .",
    "in fact , we find an alternative variant of the description which does not at all demand the existence of @xmath152 and @xmath185 resonances , however , at the expense of abandoning the @xmath6 model relations among strong coupling constants .",
    "the corresponding curves look even better than those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]@xmath147[fig5 ] in that @xmath152 and @xmath185 peaks , which seem accidental , are absent in this variant .",
    "looking at the curves in the present paper convinces us that fitting the scarce data with expressions containing many free parameters can bring one to the trap of low @xmath141 when the curve goes through the central points , each possessing large error bars . a narrow structure at @xmath186 gev seen in figs . [ fig1 ]",
    "@xmath147 [ fig3 ] and [ fig6 ] , is due to the @xmath185 resonance .",
    "nonzero coupling constants of the @xmath185 resulting in its narrow width possess very large errors which make the former to be consistent with zero .",

    "nevertheless , we include just the present variant because it is coherent with the variant of the description of the isovector channels @xcite based on the picture of two heavier resonances @xmath187 and @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "an additional illustration of such a trap is the channel @xmath189 .",
    "the curve with parameters obtained from fitting the reaction @xmath190 and with the proper reversing of sign of the isovector contribution goes through four low energy olya points @xcite but fails to describe the higher energy dm1 data @xcite consisting of eight experimental points .",
    "when we fit the data @xcite on neutral kaons , we obtain @xmath141 as low as 5 . the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] goes through almost each experimental point , yet looks unnatural in view of very large error bars",
    ". the only way of escaping a trap of this sort and of proving or disproving any particular model of resonances in the mass range @xmath191 gev is to collect good consistent data on all relevant channels .",
