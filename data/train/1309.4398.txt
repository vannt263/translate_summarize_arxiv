    "dynamic magnetic fields have complex and interesting relationships with a physical property of plasmas , the magnetic diffusivity , @xmath0 , defined as the ratio of the electrical resistivity to the magnetic permeability . the usual form of the induction equation derived from maxwell s equations and ohm s law : @xmath1\\ ] ]",
    "shows that both diffusivity @xmath0 and flows @xmath2 constrain the rate of change of magnetic fields @xmath3 .",
    "magnetic diffusivity can be enhanced by plasma turbulence ( leighton 1964 ) , and strong magnetic fields can suppress turbulence @xcite . therefore magnetic fields can suppress ( or `` quench '' ) turbulence - enhanced diffusivity ( gilman & rempel 2005 ) , which can then permit fields to amplify locally , within limits .",
    "nonlinear interactions between diffusivity quenching and magnetic fields evolution are being studied numerically in the context of the solar dynamo @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are primarily interested in an analytic relationship between dynamic magnetic fields @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "we find that gradients in magnetic diffusivity @xmath0 can cause the magnetic fields @xmath3 to advect , adding a new flow term to the induction equation .",
    "our new advection term can ultimately restructure both @xmath0 ( which generally varies in space as well as in time ) and the magnetic fields .",
    "such processes may have important physical implications for magnetohydrodynamics in the convection zone and for the solar dynamo , among other systems .",
    "our original motivation in this inquiry was to better understand the fundamental source of the `` diamagnetic pumping velocity , '' @xmath4 described as driving magnetic advection in the context of the mean field dynamo equation @xmath5\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the linear turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xcite , ch.4 . in the process of investigating this relation",
    ", we rigorously derived expressions for magnetic field advection , as described below .",
    "we derive magnetic advection explictly from diffusivity gradients , using the induction equation ( 1 ) . in an effort to understand rdiger s equation ( [ rudmf ] ) , we note the presence of @xmath7 terms and seek to relate them directly to @xmath8 . since @xmath9",
    "we can rewrite this as @xmath10 assuming that diffusivity gradients are only in the radial direction .",
    "it will turn out to be useful to expand a term similar to the diffusivity term in the induction equation ( 1 ) , using the result above and standard vector identities . letting @xmath11 , we find that @xmath12 & = & \\nabla \\times \\left [ \\sqrt{\\eta } \\,\\bf{c } \\right ] \\\\ & = & \\sqrt{\\eta } \\nabla \\times \\bf{c } + \\nabla \\sqrt{\\eta } \\times \\bf{c } \\\\ & = & \\sqrt{\\eta}\\ , \\nabla \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } ) + \\nabla \\sqrt{\\eta } \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } ) .\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using ( [ 2sqrteta ] ) in the last term , this becomes @xmath13 = \\sqrt{\\eta}\\ , \\nabla \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } ) + \\frac{\\nabla \\eta}{2 \\sqrt{\\eta } } \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\bf{b}).\\ ] ] recalling the identity @xmath14 , and multiplying by @xmath15 , we find @xmath16 \\right ) =",
    "- \\eta \\nabla^2 { \\bf{b}}+ { \\frac{1}{2}}\\nabla \\eta \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } ) .\\ ] ] the last term above can be rewritten using the vector identity @xmath17 and letting @xmath18 : @xmath19 keeping only first - order differentials in @xmath0 , we have @xmath20 combining this result with ( [ 4del2b ] ) yields @xmath21 \\right ) = -\\eta \\nabla^2 { \\bf{b}}- { \\frac{1}{2}}(\\nabla \\eta \\cdot \\nabla ) { \\bf{b}}\\ , .\\ ] ] similarly , we can rewrite the exact diffusivity term in the induction equation ( 1 ) , using @xmath11 , the same vector identities , and ( 8) : @xmath22 & = & \\eta \\nabla \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } )   + \\nabla \\eta \\times ( \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } ) \\\\ & = & -\\eta \\nabla^2 { \\bf{b}}- ( \\nabla \\eta \\cdot \\nabla ) { \\bf{b}}. \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] halving the last term in this result , we obtain two terms as in the right - hand side of ( [ 6del2b ] ) : @xmath23 = - \\eta \\nabla^2 { \\bf{b}}- { \\frac{1}{2}}(\\nabla \\eta \\cdot \\nabla ) { \\bf{b}}- { \\frac{1}{2}}(\\nabla \\eta \\cdot \\nabla ) { \\bf{b}}.\\ ] ] comparing ( [ 6del2b ] ) and ( [ 7halfhalf ] ) , we find @xmath24 = \\sqrt{\\eta}\\left [ \\nabla \\times \\left(\\sqrt{\\eta}\\ , \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } \\right ) \\right ] - { \\frac{1}{2}}(\\nabla \\eta \\cdot \\nabla ) { \\bf{b}}\\ , .\\ ] ] using ( 3 ) , we can rewrite @xmath25 then ( [ 8combine ] ) becomes @xmath26 = \\sqrt{\\eta}\\left [ \\nabla \\times \\left(\\sqrt{\\eta } \\ , \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } \\right ) \\right ] - \\nabla \\sqrt{\\eta } \\cdot ( \\sqrt{\\eta}\\,\\nabla ) { \\bf{b}}\\ , .\\ ] ] a more enlightening form can be obtained by letting @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath29 = \\nabla ' \\times \\nabla ' \\times \\bf{b } - ( \\bf{u_{\\eta } } \\cdot   \\nabla ' { \\bf{b } } ) \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the magnetic field advection velocity due to diffusivity gradients , and the gradient operator @xmath31 is also rescaled by the square root of the diffusivity .",
    "note that ( [ 10de ] ) has the form of a diffusion equation itself , with constant diffusion coefficient equal to 1 , which may be particularly easy to simulate .",
    "finally , the induction equation becomes @xmath32 \\\\ & = & \\nabla \\times   ( \\bf{v } \\times \\bf{b } ) + \\nabla \\eta \\cdot ( \\sqrt{\\eta } \\nabla { \\bf{b } } ) - \\sqrt{\\eta } \\left [ \\nabla \\times \\left(\\sqrt{\\eta } \\ , \\nabla \\times \\bf{b } \\right ) \\right]\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath33",
    "it is well known that magnetic fields diffuse more readily into ( or out of ) regions of higher magnetic diffusivity ( depending on relative magnetic field concentrations ) , and that they tend to `` freeze '' into regions of low diffusivity ( high conductivity ) .",
    "the new `` flow '' term in our induction / diffusion equation , @xmath34 , takes the form of a convective derivative term , with field advection velocity @xmath28 .",
    "the last term @xmath35 in ( [ eqn1new ] ) is analogous to that in a heat flow equation ; here diffusion depends on the @xmath0-scaled gradient , @xmath36 ( fig.1 ) . in nonlinear dynamic systems",
    ", the relationship may not be so simple , as the diffusivity itself can vary in response to field changes .",
    "whether fields are advected into or out of regions of changing magnetic diffusivity ( or field strength ) also depends on what other effects are operating ( e.g. magnetic buoyancy , magnetic reconnection , etc . ) , and with what relative strengths .    for example",
    ", we have observed in flux - transport dynamo simulations that , when magnetic fields encounter steep diffusivity gradients leading into regions of very low diffusivity , e.g. near the tachocline , it is possible for these fields to get trapped in high - conductivity regions , where they are prevented from further participation in meridional circulation ( fig.2 ) . in some cases , this trapping can quench the solar dynamo altogether ( zita 2010 ) .",
    "diffusion gradients due to magnetic reconnection have been shown to modify the effective convection of the magnetic field , in simulations of the photospheric meridional flow @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that gradients in resistivity ( or diffusivity ) can provide a driving force for resistive tearing modes in regions of antiparallel magnetic fields .",
    "this has been demonstrated in laboratory plasmas such as the reversed - field pinch @xcite , and inferred in solar and galactic dynamics ( parker 1970 , 1971 ) .",
    "magnetic quenching of turbulence has also been studied in supernova remnants ( ziegler 1996 ) .",
    "in equation ( [ rudmf ] ) , as usual in mean field theory ( mft ) , one considers two components of the total magnetic field ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the mean field @xmath38 varies on length scales much longer than those of the field fluctuations @xmath39 . similarly , the total velocity @xmath40 has mean ( @xmath41 ) and fluctuating ( @xmath42 ) components .",
    "the expansion of the general induction equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) in mean field theory @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is generally simplied to @xmath44 .\\ ] ] one general result of mean field theory is that the @xmath45 of the cross product between small fluctuations in flows and small fluctuations in fields can yield a mean electromotive force , @xmath46 even if the local volume average of each fluctuating term vanishes .",
    "these can produce significant emfs @xmath47 , which can create and/or sustain mean magnetic fields .",
    "for example , in toroidal reversed field pinch ( rfp ) plasma experiments @xcite , the fluctuations @xmath48 create an @xmath49 which supports the mean axial @xmath50 well beyond the predicted lifetimes of these high magnetic energy density devices , which operate outside the kruskal - shafranov limit and tend to spontaneously relax to a dynamic force - free state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath52 terms in ( [ emf ] ) are an alternate way of looking at the mean - field emf , using the diagonal and off - diagonal terms of the turbulent velocity tensor , respectively @xcite . to complicate matters , ziegler ( 1996 ) notes that each component of these tensors should have its own quenching factor ( ferriere & schmidt 2000 , p.139 ) . returning to our original inquiry",
    ": can our derivation help us understand the analytic origin of equation ( [ rudmf ] ) ?",
    "the diamagnetic pumping velocity in that relation , which `` will dominate the transport of mean magnetic fields '' ( p.132 ) , is proportional to diffusivity gradients in the limiting cases of both weak and strong fields ( p.114 ) : @xmath53 when @xmath38 = 0 , and @xmath54 for strong @xmath38 , where @xmath55 is a function of rotation and field strength .",
    "this differs in general from our advection velocity @xmath28 .    though rdiger s mft equation ( 2 ) @xmath56\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] appears similar to our induction equation @xmath57 \\ , , \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fact these are quite independent .",
    "the former is from mft and the latter is derived from mhd .",
    "the advection velocity is field - dependent and linear with diffusivity gradients in mft ; while the advection velocity is field - independent and nonlinear with @xmath58 in mhd .",
    "though we have not met our original goal , we have answered a potentially interesting new question .",
    "a magnetohydrodynamic analysis motivated by a question from mean field theory has produced a new magnetic field diffusion equation ( [ 10de ] ) and a new form of the induction equation ( [ eqn1new ] ) .",
    "these specify the role of magnetic diffusivity in changing magnetic fields . magnetic field advection by gradients in turbulent diffusivity is relevant to solar dynamo theory , and may be fruitfully applied to space and laboratory plasmas .",
