    "insulating rare - earth titanate pyrochlores ( a@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , where a is tri - positive rare - earth ion ) are known to show complex magnetic behaviors , arising from the geometrical frustration of exchange interaction between the rare - earth spins located on an infinite network of corner - sharing tetrahedrons @xcite .",
    "theoretically , for antiferromagnetically coupled classical or heisenberg spins on the pyrochlore lattice the magnetic ground state should be infinitely degenerate @xcite .",
    "however , the ubiquitous presence of residual terms , like next near - neighbor interactions , crystal field and dipolar interactions can remove this macroscopic degeneracy either completely or partially leading often to complex spin structures at low temperatures @xcite .",

    "we support this assignment for the following reason : it is well established that the symmetry - allowed six raman active modes ( @xmath20 ) in pyrochlore involve only the vibrations of oxygen atoms .",
    "this will imply that isotopic substitution by o@xmath26 in pyrochlore should lower the phonon frequencies by @xmath2 5 % .",

    "another argument against p7 being a combination mode is the pressure dependence of the modes presented later ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "possible candidates for the combination are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the pressure derivative of frequency of the mode p7 ( @xmath29 ) does not agree with the sum of the pressure derivatives of the individual modes .",
    "next , the question arises on the origin of the modes p1 and p2 .",
    "since these modes are also seen in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and in non - magnetic lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , their crystal field ( cf ) origin can be completely ruled out .",
    "we , therefore , attribute these low frequency modes to disorder induced raman active modes . the high frequency modes ( p8 and p9 )",
    "are possibly second - order raman modes @xcite .",
    "we have recorded raman spectra of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 from room temperature down to 27 k and followed the temperature dependence of the modes p1 , p3 , p4 , p5 and p7 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the modes p1 , p3 , p5 and p7 soften with decreasing temperature . since the raman bands p2 and p6 are weak near room temperature , their temperature dependence is not shown .",
    "it needs to be mentioned that temperature - dependent anomalies of the modes p1 , p5 and p7 have also been reported in other pyrochlore titanates @xcite and attributed to phonon - phonon anharmonic interactions .",
    "however , anomalous behavior of the @xmath23(p3 ) mode near 300 @xmath22 has been reported only in the non - magnetic lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 pyrochlore @xcite .",
    "we evidence a similar anomaly in p3 in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 with unusually broad linewidth .",
    "recently , maczka _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also reported this unusually broad linewidths in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 which has been explained in terms of coupling between phonon and crystal field transition .",
    "temperature dependence of a phonon mode ( @xmath30 ) of frequency @xmath31 can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath32 the term @xmath33 corresponds to the phonon frequency at absolute zero . in eqn . 1 above",
    ", the first term on the right hand side corresponds to quasiharmonic contribution to the frequency change .",
    "the second term corresponds to the intrinsic anharmonic contribution to phonon frequency that comes from the real part of the self - energy of the phonon decaying into two phonons ( cubic anharmonicity ) or three phonons ( quartic anharmonicity ) .",
    "the third term @xmath34 is the renormalisation of the phonon energy due to coupling of phonons with charge carriers in the system which is absent in insulating pyrochlore titanates .",
    "the last term , @xmath35 , is the change in phonon frequency due to spin - phonon coupling arising from modulation of the spin exchange integral by the lattice vibration .",
    "recently , we have shown @xcite that the magnitude of phonon anomalies is comparable in both magnetic and non - magnetic pyrochlore titanates , thus ruling out any contribution from spin - phonon coupling .",
    "therefore , the change in phonon frequency is solely due to quasiharmonic and intrinsic anharmonic effects whose temperature variations , as estimated below for the modes p1 , p3 , p5 and p7 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the change in phonon frequency due to quasiharmonic effects ( @xmath36 ) comes from the change in the unit cell volume .",
    "this change can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath33 is the frequency of the @xmath38 phonon mode at 0 k , @xmath39 is the temperature - dependent grneisen parameter of that phonon and @xmath40 is the temperature - dependent coefficient of the volume expansion .",
    "since our lowest temperature is 27 k , the quasiharmonic change can be approximated as , @xmath41 assuming the grneisen parameter to be temperature independent . to measure the @xmath42 , we have recorded x - ray diffraction patterns of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 from room temperature to 10 k. we present the temperature - dependent lattice parameter in fig .",

    "@xcite , it was shown that the lattice undergoes an anomalous expansion along with broadening of allowed bragg peaks as temperature is reduced below @xmath2 10 k. this was attributed to structural fluctuation from cubic - to - tetragonal lattice that consequently coincides with the development of correlated spin - liquid ground state in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "our data are up to 10 k and hence , we could not observe this feature at low temperatures .",
    "we have derived the temperature - dependent coefficient of thermal expansion ( @xmath46 ) from the temperature - dependent lattice parameter which is shown in the inset of fig .",

    "the @xmath47 at 300 k for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is ( @xmath48 ) , slightly higher than those of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath49 ) and lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath50 ) , estimated from the temperature - dependent x - ray diffraction results reported in ref .",
    "we note that @xmath51 for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is about 10 times higher than that of si @xcite and nearly 7 times higher than that of gd@xmath0zr@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , implying that the anharmonic interactions in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 are strong .",
    "the mode grneisen parameter for @xmath38 phonon mode is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the bulk modulus , @xmath54 is the frequency change with pressure @xmath55 .",
    "taking b=154 gpa , obtained from our high pressure x - ray diffraction data discussed later , we find the values of the grneisen parameter for the various modes as listed in table - i .",
    "the change in phonon frequency due to quasiharmonic effect , @xmath56 , has been estimated for the modes p1 , p3 , p5 and p7 , and is shown in the insets of fig .",

    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "we note that the temperature - dependent @xmath58 for these four modes is anomalous .",
    "further , upon changing the temperature from 27 k to 300 k , we find that for the mode p1 , the percentage change in frequency due to anharmonic interactions , @xmath59 , is exceptionally high .",
    "it is customary to fit the @xmath58 data by the expression @xcite , @xmath60 where the @xmath38 phonon decays into two phonons of equal energy ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the parameter `` @xmath62 '' can be positive ( for normal behavior of phonon ) or negative ( anomalous phonon ) @xcite .",
    "we have seen that eqn .",
    "4 does not fit to our data of @xmath58 ( fitting not shown in fig . [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "this may be because , in the expression for @xmath58 ( eqn .",
    "4 ) , all the decay channels for the phonons are not taken into account .",
    "therefore , a full calculation for the anharmonic interactions considering all the possible decay channels is required to understand the @xmath58 data , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .    considering only the cubic phonon - phonon anharmonic interactions where a phonon decays into two phonons of equal energy , the temperature - dependent broadening of the linewidth can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath33 is the zero temperature frequency and @xmath64 is the linewidth arising from disorder .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows the temperature dependence of linewidths of the raman modes p3 , p4 and p5 .",
    "it can be seen that the linewidth of p3 and p4 modes are almost double of the linewidth of the p5 mode , as reported by maczka _",
    "these authors have attributed this to the strong coupling of the @xmath23(p3 ) and @xmath24(p4 ) phonons with the crystal field transitions of tb@xmath3 which is absent for the @xmath25 ( p5 ) mode due to symmetry consideration . to strengthen this argument",
    ", we compare ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) these results with the linewidths of the corresponding phonons in non - magnetic lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( lu@xmath3 : j=0 ) @xcite and , indeed , the linewidths of p3 and p4 modes in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 are much broader than those in lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 . the change in linewidth of the @xmath23(p3 ) mode in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 from room temperature down to 27 k is nearly half the change in linewidth of the same mode in lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and , therefore , the parameter `` @xmath65 '' for @xmath23(p3 ) mode in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 is 7.2 @xmath22 , which is nearly half of that in lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath65=13.4 @xmath22 ) .",
    "however , the linewidth of the @xmath25 mode for both titanates is comparable and , therefore , the fitting parameter `` @xmath65 '' for this mode in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 are nearly the same , i.e. , 7.8 @xmath22 and 7.3 @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "all these results , therefore , corroborate the suggestion of maczka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite thus emphasizing a strong coupling between the phonon and crystal field modes .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows room temperature raman spectra at ambient and a few high pressures , the maximum pressure being @xmath2 25 gpa .",
    "we could not resolve p2 and p9 at room temperature inside the high pressure cell due to the reasons described above .",
    "the phonon frequencies increase with increasing pressure , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] .",

    "[ fig:7 ] , the maximum change in phonon frequency is seen in mode p7 ( @xmath23 ) , which shows a dramatic change in the rate of change of frequency with pressure at a pressure of @xmath2 9 gpa . in sharp contrast , the other modes p3 , p4 and",
    "p5 do not show any change in slope till the maximum pressure applied .",
    "the changes seen in the modes p1 , p6 and p7 near 9 gpa are indicative of a structural transition of the tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 lattice . in order to ascertain the structural transition we have performed high pressure x - ray diffraction measurements and the results are discussed below .",
    "[ fig:9 ] shows the x - ray diffraction patterns of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 at a few high pressures .",
    "the ( hkl ) values are marked on the corresponding diffraction peaks .",
    "as we increase the pressure , we find that the diffraction peaks shift to higher angles but no signature of new peak or peak splitting could be observed .",
    "however , the change in lattice parameter with pressure , shown in fig . [ fig:10 ] , shows a change in slope near 9 gpa implying a structural deformation , thus corroborating the transition observed in the raman data .",
    "the transition possibly involves just a local rearrangement of the atoms retaining the cubic symmetry of the crystal .",
    "fitting the pressure - dependent volume to the third order birch - murnaghan equation of state @xcite , we find that b = 154 gpa and b@xmath17=6.6 when the applied pressure is below 9 gpa .",
    "but , when the applied pressure is above this transition pressure , these values change to b = 250 gpa and b@xmath17 = 7.1 thus implying an increment of the bulk modulus by @xmath2 62% after the transition .",
    "a similar transition had also been observed @xcite in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 at @xmath2 9 gpa and was attributed to the tio@xmath66 octahedral rearrangement .",
    "it needs to be mentioned here that the pressure transmitting medium ( methanol - ethanol mixture , used in our raman experiments ) remains hydrostatic up to 10 gpa which is close to the transition pressure , thus implying that the possibility of a contribution from non - hydrostaticity of the medium can not be completely ruled out .",
    "however , experiments in a non - hydrostatic medium ( water ) has as well revealed the transition at @xmath2 9 gpa in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , believe that the transition near 9 gpa is an intrinsic property of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and also that performing this experiment with helium as the pressure transmitting medium , will further strengthen our suggestion of a possible transition at @xmath2 9 gpa .",
    "we have performed temperature and pressure - dependent raman and x - ray diffraction studies on pyrochlore tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 and the main results can be summarised as follows : ( 1 ) the phonon frequencies show anomalous temperature dependence , ( 2 ) the linewidths of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 modes near 300 @xmath22 are unusually broad in comparison to those of non - magnetic lu@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 phonons , thus corroborating the suggestion @xcite of a possible coupling between phonons and crystal field transitions , ( 3 ) intensities of two phonon modes ( p1 and p6 ) decrease to zero as the applied pressure approaches 9 gpa .",

    "we note that the anharmonicity of the mode p1 ( mode near 200 @xmath22 ) is unusually high as compared to other modes .",
    "p1 is a phonon mode which do not involve oxygen but includes the vibrations of ti@xmath69 ions @xcite .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood by examining how ti@xmath69 and tb@xmath3 ions are coordinated .",
    "there are tetrahedra in the unit cell which are occupied by ti@xmath69 ions at the vertices with a vacant 8@xmath70-site inside .",
    "the later will tend to make the vibrational amplitudes of ti@xmath69 ions larger and thus contributing to the high anharmonic nature of the p1 mode .",
    "the high anharmonic behavior of the raman modes involving 48@xmath18-oxygen ions arises due to the fact that the o@xmath71 anions are off centered towards the 8@xmath70-vacant site from their ideal position @xmath72 to @xmath73 inside the tetrahedra @xcite whose two vertices are occupied by ti@xmath69 and other two by tb@xmath3 . here",

    "these results suggest a subtle stuctural deformation which gets corroborated by a change in bulk modulus seen in pressure - dependent x - ray experiments .",
    "however , the pressure - dependent x - ray data do not reveal any new diffraction peak or splitting of line .",
    "this implies that the structural deformation near 9 gpa , as inferred from the raman study , is a local distortion of the lattice",
