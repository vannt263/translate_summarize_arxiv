    "multirotor helicopters are attracting increasing attention in recent years because of their important contribution and cost effective application in several tasks such as surveillance , search and rescue missions and so on .",
    "however , there exists a potential risk to civil safety if the helicopters crash especially in an urban area .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to consider the flight safety of multirotor helicopters in the presence of rotor faults or failures .",
    "over - actuated aircraft have the potential to improve safety and reliability .",
    "fault tolerant control of over - actuated aircraft subject to actuator failures is discussed widely @xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    "sometimes , a hexacopter is uncontrollable if one rotor fails . owing to this ,",
    "the hexacopter subject to rotor failures is often controlled by leaving the yaw states uncontrolled , the feasibility of which has been tested by @xcite@xcite .",

    "if the maximum lift of each rotor is lower than a certain value then the degraded system , where the yaw states of the considered hexacopter are ignored , is still uncontrollable .",
    "our another motivation is to specify this lower bound value .    in this paper , the controllability of a class of hexacopters subject to one rotor failure",
    "is analyzed based on the positive controllability theory in @xcite , and the results show that the hexacopter is uncontrollable . in order to land the hexacopter safely , a degraded control strategy ( dcs ) is proposed for the degraded system .",

    "<S> a fault tolerant control strategy is proposed to control a degraded system , where the yaw states of the considered hexacopter are ignored . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical analysis indicates that the degraded system is controllable if and only if the maximum lift of each rotor is greater than a certain value . </S>",
