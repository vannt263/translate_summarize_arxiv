    "wr stars represent an evolved stage of hot ( @xmath0k ) , massive ( @xmath1 ) stars , and display some of the strongest sustained winds among galactic objects : their terminal velocities may reach the range @xmath2km / s . perhaps with the exception of the short lived luminous blue variables ( lbvs )",
    ", they have the highest known mass loss rate @xmath3yr of any stellar type .",
    "thus , colliding winds of massive star binary systems are considered as potential sites of non - thermal high - energy photon production , via leptonic and/or hadronic process after acceleration of primary particles in the collision shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this possibility is substantiated by the detection of ( non - thermal ) synchrotron radio - emission from the expected colliding wind location in some binaries ( see below ) .",
    "many models have been proposed to predict gev to tev emission from these binaries , with different levels of detail ( e.g. , among recent works see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conceptually , the process would mimic the cases of ls5039 @xcite , psrb1259 - 63 @xcite or lsi+61303 @xcite , particularly if they result in pulsar - driven @xmath4-ray binaries in which @xmath4-rays may arise from a shock region produced by the interaction of the winds of the two components .    in a recent paper , the high energy stereoscopic array ( h.e.s.s . )",
    "collaboration reported the discovery of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath4-ray emission coincident with the young stellar cluster westerlund2 @xcite .",
    "the high energy gamma ray astronomy ( hegra ) and the major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov ( magic ) telescope detected the source tevj2032 + 4130 and suggested a possible connection with the cygnus ob2 cluster @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the relationship between stellar associations and high - energy emission has been put forward by many authors , since early - type stellar associations have long been proposed as cosmic - ray acceleration sites and also as providers of target material for cosmic - ray interactions and references therein .    in the case of cygnusob2 ,",
    "the vhe emission is supposed to occur at a region displaced from the center of the association , where detailed multiwavelength studies revealed an overdensity of hot ob stars , although not wrs @xcite . in the case of westerlund2 ,",
    "the stellar cluster contains at least a dozen early - type o - stars , and two remarkable wr stars , wr20a and wr20b .",
    "in particular , wr20a was recently established to be a binary @xcite . based on the orbital period ,",
    "the minimum masses were found to be around @xmath5@xmath6 and @xmath7@xmath6 for the binary components @xcite , what certainly qualifies it among the most massive binary systems in our galaxy .",
    "no significant flux variability or orbital periodicity was found in the corresponding data sets , neither for the cygnusob2 nor for the westerlund2 regions .",
    "unless such an orbital period is detected in future datasets , it would be very difficult or impossible for the current generation of instruments to distinguish whether the radiation observed from these associations is coming from a isolated binary system or rather is generated as a collective effect of the whole cluster .",
    "thus , a direct measurement of single wr binary systems , to explore whether they are able to produce high - energy @xmath4-ray emission in an isolated condition , is worth pursuing .",
    "after briefly motivating the scenario for @xmath4-ray emission from isolated binary systems , we present the results of magic observations of two such systems .",
    "for the present investigation , and apart from other technical considerations like a favorable declination , we looked for candidates with non - thermal emission , indicating the presence of relativistic electrons , and for which the geometry of the colliding wind region is established .",
    "the two selected systems wr146 and wr147 have been resolved using the very large array ( vla ) and the multi - element radio linked interferometer ( merlin ) in two sources each and at least for wr147 , where the most detailed model is currently available , the system was predicted to be a powerful magic source for most of the orbital period @xcite .    for the angular resolution of the magic telescope ( @xmath8 ) the colliding wind zone will not appear to be spatially resolved , presenting individual colliding wind binary systems as point - source candidates at the @xmath4-ray sky .",
    "thus we have searched for point sources in the direction of these two binaries .",
    "wr147 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , among the closest and brightest systems that show non - thermal radio emission in the cm band , is composed of a wn8(h ) plus a b0.5v star with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath9 and effective temperature @xmath10k , i.e. thermal photon energy of about @xmath11ev . at a distance of 650pc the implied binary separation",
    "is estimated to be 417au .",
    "the mass loss rates ( @xmath12/yr , @xmath13/yr ) and wind velocities ( @xmath14km / s , @xmath15km / s ) place the stagnation point at @xmath16 cm .",
    "this is in fact in agreement with merlin observations , which show a northern non - thermal component and a southern thermal one with a separation of ( @xmath17)mas @xcite .",
    "this radio morphology and spectrum support a colliding wind scenario @xcite , whose collision region has also been detected by the chandra x - ray telescope @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal flux component can be well fitted by a power law with spectral index @xmath18 .",
    "neither the eccentricity nor the inclination of the system are known due to the very long orbital period ( 1350 yr , as derived by * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have provided a detailed modeling of the high - energy @xmath4-ray emission expected from wr147 .",
    "the expected fluxes are shown in figure  [ fig : wr147 ] , together with magic upper limits for which we give further details below .",
    "wr147 was observed with the magic telescope between 11 august and 10 september 2007 , for a total of 30.3 hours of good data ( after quality cuts removing bad weather runs ) . the zenith angle of the observations ranged between 10@xmath19 and 30@xmath19 , being sensitive to gamma - rays in the energy range between about 80gev and 10tev .",
    "the observations were carried out in the false - source track ( wobble ) mode @xcite , with two directions at @xmath20 distance east - west of the source direction .",
    "the analysis of the data was performed with the magic standard analysis chain @xcite , which combines hillas image parameters by means of a random forest algorithm @xcite for signal / background discrimination and energy estimation .",
    "the training of the algorithm is done by means of contemporary data from the crab nebula observations and monte carlo simulated gamma - ray events . since february 2007",
    ", magic signal digitization has been upgraded to 2gsample / s flash analog - to - digital coverters ( fadcs ) , and timing parameters are used during the data analysis  @xcite .",
    "this results in an improvement of the flux sensitivity from 2.5@xmath21 to 1.6@xmath21 ( at a flux peak energy of 280gev ) of the crab nebula flux in 50 hours of observations .",
    "rrrrrr @xmath2280 & -196@xmath23175 & -1.1 & 150 ( @xmath24 ) + @xmath22200 & -92@xmath2389 & -1.0 & 84 ( @xmath25 ) + @xmath22600 & -20@xmath2324 & -0.8 & 28 ( @xmath26 )    searches of gamma - rays from wr147 have been performed for three different energy cuts , namely : above 80gev , above 200gev and above 600gev . in all cases",
    "the number of signal candidate events found are compatible with statistical fluctuations of the expected background .",
    "the obtained upper limits are shown in table  [ tab : wr147 ] and figure  [ fig : wr147 ] , and correspond to 1.5@xmath21 , 1.4@xmath21 and 1.7@xmath21 of the crab nebula flux for the three considered energy bins , respectively .",
    "wr146 is a similar system : a wc6+o8 colliding - wind binary system also presenting thermal emission from the stellar winds of the two stars , and bright non - thermal emission from the wind - collision region ( e.g. , see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the period is estimated to be @xmath27 300yr @xcite and the estimates of the distance to the system differ from 0.75kpc to 1.7kpc ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein for other system parameters ) .",
    "wr146 is located @xmath28 away from the unidentified vhe @xmath4-ray source tev j2032 + 4130 and was observed with magic within the observation program devoted to this source @xcite , albeit with a reduced sensitivity .",
    "the total effective exposure , which accounts for the loss of sensitivity of off - axis observations and camera illumination during moonlight observations @xcite , is 44.5 hours , obtained between 2005 and 2007 . at magic site , wr146 culminates at 14@xmath19 and the observations were carried out at zenith angles between 14@xmath19 and 44@xmath19 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the data analysis follows the standard magic analysis chain .",
    "since most of the data are acquired with 300 mhz fadcs , image timing parameters are not used in this analysis .",

    "all measured signal candidates are consistent with background fluctuations and the upper limits ( corresponding to @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the crab nebula flux ) are presented . at the lower energy bins we see a positive number of excesses at the @xmath35 level . however , the present data are too scarce to establish if this comes from a gamma - ray signal or background fluctuations .",
    "future observations will shed light on this issue .",
    "our search for vhe @xmath4-ray emission from two archetypical cases of wr binaries produced the first bounds on such systems .",
    "these bounds constrain theoretical models ( or , assuming correctness of the models , their internal parameters , such as the -unknown- orbital phases of the systems ) . the establishment of wr binaries as vhe @xmath4-ray sources is yet pending .",
    "the case for wr147 as a potential @xmath4-ray source for magic was theoretically established before , as shown in the corresponding curves of figure  [ fig : wr147 ] from @xcite , for most of the orbital phases .",
    "the validity of this model is baselined on an assumed ensemble of orbital parameters , which are still unknown for this system .",
    "for instance , ignorance of its current phase as well as of its eccentricity and inclination makes a direct ruling out of this model impossible , although that the presented scenario could nominally survive only for phases close to 0 , defined where the line of sight encounters first with the wn8 and then the b0.5v star .",
    "the magic observations show that irrespective of phase , glast should see a flux cutoff well within its range of detectability in the tens of gev regime , if it is able to detect the stars at all .",
