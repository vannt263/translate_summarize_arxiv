    "the discovery that acoustic energy can be converted to light through an oscillating air bubble trapped in water @xcite has triggered extensive studies on single - bubble sonoluminescence ( sbsl ) ( see reviews in refs .",

    "is emitted during the violent collapse of the bubble in each acoustic cycle @xcite . among many candidate mechanisms of sbsl light emission ,",
    "the model that identified sbsl light emission as thermal bremsstrahlung and recombination radiation from an optically thin bubble seemed to predict the widths , shapes , and spectra of the emitted light fairly well under certain simplified hydrodynamic frameworks @xcite .",
    "similar models included those which used finite opacity to define a variable blackbody core @xcite , whose suitability was reflected in the good fitting by a smaller - than - bubble blackbody @xcite .",
    "however , different approximations in modelling the physical - chemical processes , and particularly , uncertainties under the extreme conditions inside a sonoluminescing bubble , may give diverse predictions that plague the validity of a light emission model .",
    "therefore , more realistic hydrodynamic - chemical modelling and more critical tests of the light emission models under the refined hydro - chemical framework are necessary .",
    "past studies delineated the important effects of diffusive transport , surface tension , and compressibility of the surrounding liquid on sbsl @xcite .",

    "recently , the study of sonochemsitry was extended from lower temperature to higher temperature situations where sbsl emerges @xcite .",
    "yasui @xcite presented a model of sbsl that accounts for evaporation - condensation process at the bubble interface and water vapor chemical reactions .",
    "it was later stressed by storey and szeri @xcite and others @xcite that water vapor reduce the temperatures inside the sl bubble significantly by reducing the compression heating of the mixture and through primarily endothermic chemical reactions . in some of these models , spatial uniformity of the bubble interior",
    "was assumed and inter - molecular mass diffusion was not properly accounted for . as a consequence ,",
    "such models tended to underpredict the amount of trapped water vapor during the rapid collapse .    in the full hydrochemical numerical study by storey and szeri @xcite ,",
    "the consequences of water vapor inside strongly forced argon bubbles were investigated in detail .",
    "the interaction of nonlinearity of the volume oscillations , mass diffusion , and nonequilibrium phase change at the bubble wall resulted in excess water vapor trapped in the bubble during the violent collapse .",

    "the newly added feature is that the nonequilibrium processes of evaporation and condensation , species diffusion , noble gas exchange between the bubble and the surrounding liquid , and dissociations of water vapor and ionizations of atomic species inside the bubble are all taken into account . the numerical scheme for solving the hydrodynamic equations is modified to be a semi - implicit one which allows for better numerical stability than original explicit scheme in ref .",

    "the effects of sonochemistry on current light - emitting models of sbsl @xcite are studied in detail through comparison with a calibrated experiment @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions are : ( i ) the chemical reactions reduce the temperature within the bubble to such an extent that the degrees of ionization are generally very low ; ( ii ) shock waves do not appear in he or ar bubbles in the stable sbsl regime , but can occur in xe bubbles only at higher driving pressures ; ( iii ) chemical radicals generated from the water vapor contribute dominantly to the light emission of he bubbles ; ( iv ) based on the computed photon absorption coefficients , the light spectra and pulse widths computed from the popular optically thin model can hardly be fitted to the experimental ones .",

    "a possible reason is that the formation of a shock is sensitive to differences in equations of state , accommodation coefficients , chemical reactions , and treatments of the liquid motion , and so on .",
    "another feature in fig .",
    "4 is that the temperature in the inner zone is reduced more severely than in the outer zone at @xmath196 , and @xmath197 when the compression wave is not strong .",
    "this is because considerable water vapor is trapped in the inner zone of an ar bubble as a result of thermal diffusion @xcite ( which states that a heavier species tends to diffuse toward the cooler region ) and dissociates there , thus peak temperature is not at the center , but at some place close to the bubble interface . for a lighter - than - water - vapor he bubble ,",
    "less water vapor is congregated in the central zone , and temperature peak will be located at the bubble center as [ will be shown in fig .",
    "6 ( b ) ] .",
    "figure  5 shows one snapshot of the number density distributions and the degrees of ionization .",
    "it can be seen that the amounts of products due to chemical reactions are considerable , while the degrees of ionization are quite small ( the maximum being 2.8% for o@xmath3 ) , contrary to significant ionizations when water vapor was not taken into account @xcite .",
    "the degrees of ionization of h and o far exceed that of ar although ar atom is more ample in quantity .",
    "the numerical results in this subsection demonstrates that the trapped water vapor and the ensuing endothermic chemical reactions significantly reduce the temperature , resulting in very low degrees of ionization .",
    "the chemical reactions can produce considerable amounts of atomic and molecular species , some of which , such as h and o atoms , are easier to ionize than a noble gas atom such as he or ar . as the evaporation is a robust process in the bubble oscillation , chemical radicals will have significant influence on sbsl mechanism as will be shown in sec .  iv  c.      previous numerical studies pointed that shock formation depends sensitively on , among other factors @xcite , the amount of water vapor @xcite and its distribution @xcite .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that shock waves develop in a bubble filled with 70% xe and 30% ( mole fractions ) water vapor , but no shocks occur for similarly filled ar or he bubbles .",
    "with evaporation - condensation process and chemical reactions taken into account , we are able to investigate effects of noble gases on the thermodynamic processes more realistically .",
    "we calculated xe , ar and he bubbles using the same @xmath198 , and @xmath133 as those in ref .  @xcite .",
    "figures  6(a ) and 6(b ) show snapshots of the spatial profiles of thermodynamic variables around the moment of minimum bubble radius for xe and he bubbles . snapshots of the ar bubble are similar to those in fig .  4 , thus are not shown here . in the xe bubble [ fig",
    ".  6(a ) ] , it is seen that an inward - going compression wave at @xmath199 evolves into a strong outward - going shock at @xmath200 .",
    "the first focusing of the shock happened between @xmath199 and @xmath200 leads to extreme high temperatures ( @xmath201  k ) , but the duration is very short ( @xmath202 1 ps ) and the region is confined to the center ( @xmath203 m ) .",
    "however , fig .",
    "6(b ) shows that only weak compression waves occur in the he bubble .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with those of xu _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "note that the temperature peaks are often at the center in he bubble except when a wavy disturbance reflects from the bubble wall at @xmath193 .",
    "this feature mainly results from the thermal diffusion between the light he gas and the heavy water vapor as mentioned in previous subsection .",
    "figure  7(a ) and 7(b ) show one snapshot of the number density and the compositional distributions at the moment of minimum bubble radius for xe and he bubbles . in both bubbles there are significant numbers of chemical products , especially h , o , oh , and h@xmath6 . however , the right figure in fig .",
    "7(a ) indicates that atomic species in xe bubble are significantly ionized only in the central zone ( @xmath204 ) , while the right figure in fig .",
    "7(b ) shows that the degrees of ionization in he bubble are small , especially that for he gas .",
    "the situation for ar bubble is found to be in between [ fig .",
    "this suggests that chemical products of the water vapor may play an increasingly important role in sbsl from xe , ar , to he bubbles .",
    "we shall compute the emitted lights by using the optically thin model and the _ ad hoc _ finite - size blackbody model .",
    "we fit our calculations to fig .  2 of a recalibrated experiment @xcite under the same parameters as given in the beginning of this section .",
    "the former model has only @xmath115 while the latter has @xmath115 and @xmath158 in eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) as fitting parameters .",
    "figure  8 shows comparison of the spectral radiances .",
    "it is seen that the optically thin model does not match well with the experimental spectrum of xe bubble , but the finite - size blackbody model matches well .",
    "the fitting @xmath205atm of the optically thin model seems to be out of the stable sbsl range ( @xmath206 atm ) , while the fitting @xmath207atm of the _ ad hoc _ finite - size blackbody is within the range , of course with the help of a large value @xmath208 .",
    "( fitting using @xmath209atm and a smaller value , @xmath210 can also give similar spectrum but the resulting fwhm is only 40 ps , much shorter than experimental 200 ps . )",
    "however , it can be seen that either models are unable to fit the spectrum of he bubble .",
    "the finite - size blackbody is much better than the optically thin model as the latter deviates severely from the experiment .",
    "the maximum temperatures at @xmath207atm for xe bubble and at @xmath211atm for he bubble are 8600 and 16 700  k , respectively , which are comparable to the blackbody fitting temperatures 8000 ( xe ) and 20 400  k ( he ) used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure  9 compares the time variations of the normalized power for the  measurable , \"",
    "`` uv '' ( 300@xmath0400 nm ) , and `` red '' ( 590@xmath0650 nm ) wavelength intervals @xcite . both models show good wave - length independence of light pulse , a key ingredient of sbsl thought by several researchers @xcite .",
    "one curves ",
    "a , \" the optically thin model gives fwhm of 26 ps for xe bubble , and 13 ps for he bubble , which are much shorter than the experimental flash widths of 200 ps ( xe ) and 100 ps ( he ) @xcite . on curves ",
    "b , \" the finite - size blackbody model predicts fwhm of 185 ps for xe bubble , and 18 ps for he bubble , better than the optically thin model .",
    "figure  10 shows the variations of the blackbody core and bubble radius with time .",
    "one can see that the blackbody core appears abruptly , attains maximum around the moment of minimum bubble radius , and disappears suddenly .",
    "the short life of the blackbody core explains why this blackbody model also shows wave - length independence of the light pulse similar to the optically thin model : the quick rise and fall of @xmath150 in accordance with the variation of the photon absorption coefficients cut down the long fall time for red light @xcite .",
    "figure  11 shows the visible light powers contributed from the total and partial species as computed by the optically thin model . in fig .",
    "11(a ) we see that the power from xenon is dominant , while that from the water vapor and its chemical products contributes a little .",
    "but in fig .",
    "11(b ) , the power from helium is small , while the water vapor and its chemical products contribute dominantly with h and o radicals being the primary ones .",
    "although the absolute values of the light powers from the optically thin model are quite small , the relative contributions to the total power verify previous postulation that light emission from radicals generated from water vapor dissociation may dominate sbsl in the he bubble @xcite .    the failure of the optically thin model to match with the experiment and the improvement by adding an _ ad hoc _ finite - size blackbody core to it raise contradiction .",
    "the major reason for the failure of the optically thin model is the significant reduction of temperature due to the existence of water vapor and endothermic chemical reactions .",
    "we remark that the present _ ad hoc _ blackbody is not the unique way for better fitting , but is shown better than other _",
    "ad hoc _ ways such as multiplying the photon absorption coefficient by an arbitrary factor .",
    "we did not exclude the possibility that the optically thin model could fit well to the experimental data should higher temperature or increased opacity be obtained in whatever a natural way . as a numerical study , we have made tests of model sensitivity to parameters . the evaporation - condensation process and chemical reaction rates are important for the modeled temperature .",
    "we used the accommodation coefficient @xmath212 @xcite as well as the formula @xcite , and found that the former led to higher temperature so that we could use @xmath213atm to obtain the same spectrum of he bubble as the one obtained by using @xmath214atm in fig .",
    "8 . however , the results were still unable to fit to the data .",
    "as to the chemical reaction rates , we compared two different reaction rate sets @xcite .",
    "there was slight difference in quantity and what we presented here was the one corresponding to higher temperature @xcite .",
    "we have already adopted the modified chemical equilibrium constant ( [ keq ] ) for a van der waals gas .",
    "this modification was claimed to let the optically thin model give sufficient light emission @xcite , but we found while it raised temperature to some extent , it could not result in enough light emission .",
    "therefore , it will be better to pursue other ways to reconcile the conflict .",
    "one conjecture was if there existed a mechanism that would greatly increase the photon absorption coefficient of the highly compressed bubble content @xcite , such as the lowering of ionization potentials @xcite .",
    "it is also wished to have better theories to compute the photon absorption coefficients of a very dense gas mixture , and to take into account other light emission processes due to the existence of chemical products .",
    "meanwhile further efforts are necessary to reduce modelling uncertainties such as the chemical reaction rates under high - pressure and high - temperature conditions , and the description of the surrounding liquid motion . the rp equation approach in this and",
    "other studies @xcite should be more critically compared with the full hydrodynamic equation approach @xcite .",
    "a refined hydrochemical model is presented to simulate the complex processes inside a sonoluminescing bubble .",
    "the numerical simulations of xe , ar , and he bubbles indicate that the trapped water vapor and its endothermic reactions reduce the temperature significantly . in the stable sbsl range , at most compression waves can appear in he or ar bubbles , while shock waves can occur in xe bubbles only for higher driving amplitudes .",
    "the lower temperature in the bubble rarely leads to appreciable ionization except for xe bubble at the center during the shock wave focusing .",
    "the chemical radicals generated from water vapor dissociations become increasingly important in the light emission from xe , ar , to he bubbles .",
    "particularly , h and o radicals are shown to be the primary light - emitting matters in he bubbles .",
    "the key finding of this study is that the optically thin thermal emission model was unable to match with experimental data mainly due to the reduced temperatures in the bubble .",
    "the introduction of a finite - size blackbody core made the calculated light spectra and pulse widths match better with experimental ones .",
    "the present expertise to define an optically thick region is _ ad hoc _ and only serves to illustrate one possible improving direction .",
    "improvements by physical considerations such as the lowering of ionization potentials and the refinement of the photon absorption processes under the extreme conditions of sonoluminescence , and by reduction of modeling uncertainties , are worthy of further investigation .",
