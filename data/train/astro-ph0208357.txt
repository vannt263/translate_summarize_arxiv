    "the discovery @xcite of the first pulsar in a binary system , psr  b1913 + 16 , introduced the possibility of powerful new experimental tests of gravity in the strong field and radiative regimes . over a quarter century , measurements of this pulsar were shown to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of general relativity @xcite .",
    "a dozen years ago the discovery @xcite of psr  b1534 + 12a bright , relatively nearby pulsar , also with a neutron - star companion  promised the independent opportunity to confirm the tests of gravity done earlier with psr  b1913 + 16 .",
    "furthermore , b1534 + 12 s favorable , nearly edge - on orbital geometry allowed new experimental tests that were complementary to those done with psr  b1913 + 16 @xcite .    in earlier work ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper  i ) we analyzed data taken over a six year period with the arecibo 305  m telescope , the 43-m telescope at green bank , west virginia , and the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank observatory , u.k .",
    "we found that those data were in agreement with the predictions of general relativity at the limit of the measurement uncertainties : about 1% .",
    "we showed that the orbital period was decreasing , as expected if the system is losing energy in the form of gravitational radiation . because the observed orbital decay rate is contaminated by kinematic effects which depend on the unknown pulsar distance @xcite , the radiation predictions of general relativity",
    "can not be tested with this pulsar to better than @xmath4 without an independent distance measurement . however , with the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity , we were able to invert the kinematic model to measure the pulsar distance to 20% .    over the past four years",
    ", we have continued our studies of psr  b1534 + 12 , using the recently upgraded arecibo telescope together with a new data acquisition system @xcite that fully removes the dispersive effects of the interstellar medium from the signal .",
    "in addition to extending the length of the data set by more than half , these new data are of substantially higher quality than those available for paper  i. in this paper , we report on timing studies based on the complete 11.5-year arecibo data set .",
    "we present the improved tests of general relativity that are now possible , give a pulsar distance accurate to 5% , and report on dispersion measure variations . in subsequent papers",
    ", we will describe the analysis of secular variations in the pulsar radiation pattern that have been interpreted as evidence for geodetic precession of the pulsar , and we will discuss single - pulse studies .",
    "in this paper we discuss results of observations made with two different observing systems at the arecibo telescope .",
    "many of the details have already been discussed in paper  i , and are only summarized here and in table  [ tab : obsparms ] .",
    "observations were made with the 305-m arecibo telescope both before its upgrade ( 19901994 ) and after its upgrade ( 19972002 ) . for our purposes ,",
    "the most important post - upgrade change was a significant reduction in the system temperature at 1400mhz , leading to an improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio achieved for a given integration time and observing bandwidth . during the period that the arecibo telescope was unavailable , observations were made with the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) 43-m telescope at green bank , and with the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank observatory , u.k .",
    "the latter two datasets were used in paper  i , but , with the abundance of high - quality post - upgrade arecibo data , they contribute nothing to the present solution and are therefore disregarded in this work .",
    "two observing systems were used .",
    "the princeton mark  iii system @xcite is an `` incoherent '' system , in which the incoming signal is decomposed into spectral channels with a filterbank .",
    "the effective time resolution is dominated by dispersion smearing of the signal during its propagation through the ionized interstellar medium , with some additional instrumental smoothing after detection of the signal .",
    "the signals in each frequency channel were folded at the instantaneous topocentric pulsar period for three to five minutes , then the channels were shifted to account for interstellar dispersion and summed to produce a single total - intensity ( summed - polarization ) pulse profile for each integration .    for the new post - upgrade data that we introduce here , we observed with a `` coherent '' system : the princeton mark  iv instrument @xcite . for each sense of circular polarization ,",
    "a 5mhz bandpass was mixed to baseband using local oscillators in phase quadrature .",
    "the four resulting signals were low - pass filtered at 2.35mhz , sampled at 5mhz with 4-bit quantization , and written to a large disk array .",
    "some of the 1400mhz observations were taken with 10mhz of bandwidth and 2-bit quantization . in the offline processing",
    ", the undetected signal voltages were dedispersed using the phase - coherent technique described by @xcite .",
    "after amplitude calibrations were applied , self- and cross - products of the right- and left - handed complex voltages yielded the stokes parameters of the incoming signal .",
    "these products were folded at the topocentric pulsar period using 1024 phase bins , and pulse toas were determined from the resulting total - intensity profiles .",
    "a summary of the more important parameters and statistics of all combinations of observing systems and telescopes is presented in table  [ tab : obsparms ] .",
    "many of the post - upgrade data come from observations on one or two days at quasi - regular intervals ; in addition we conducted 12-day intensive `` campaign - style '' observations in each of the summers of 1998 , 1999 , 2000 and 2001 , with full orbital coverage at each epoch .",
    "this mixture of data permits a high - quality timing solution and allows us to monitor , at each campaign epoch , the pulse shape changes due to geodetic precession , which we will discuss in a subsequent paper .    as in paper",
    "i , we used the same toa - fitting procedure for all data sets .",
    "each observed profile was fitted to a standard template , using a least - squares method in the fourier transform domain @xcite to measure its time offset .",
    "the offset was added to the time of the first sample of a period near the middle of the integration , thereby yielding an effective pulse arrival time . a different standard template was used for each observing system and frequency ; they were made by averaging the available profiles over several hours or more .",
    "uncertainties in the toas were estimated from the least squares procedure , and a minimum error , dependent on the observing system and frequency , was required for each toa .",
    "in addition , a cut was established such that all mark  iv toas with least - squares uncertainties greater than 10@xmath5s ( roughly 20% of the data ) were discarded ; tests show that they do not significantly affect the best - fit solution or the parameter uncertainties , and discarding these data points allows us to better assess the data quality (  [ sec : confidence ] ) .",
    "the observatory s local time standard was corrected retroactively to the utc timescale , using data from the global positioning system ( gps ) satellites .",
    "a pulse received on earth at topocentric time @xmath6 is emitted at a time in the comoving pulsar frame given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is a reference epoch and @xmath9 is the offset between the observatory master clock and the reference standard of terrestrial time .",
    "the dispersive delay is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , with the dispersion measure dm in @xmath3pc , the radio frequency @xmath12 in mhz , and the delay in seconds .",
    "the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 terms are propagation delays and relativistic time adjustments for effects within the solar system , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are similar terms accounting for phenomena within the pulsar s orbit .    in paper",
    "i , we set out the equations that define the three orbital terms @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 in terms of ten parameters .",
    "five are the standard keplerian parameters : the period @xmath19 , projected semi - major axis @xmath20 , eccentricity @xmath21 , longitude of periastron @xmath22 , and time of periastron @xmath23 .",
    "the other five are post keplerian ( pk ) parameters : the rate of advance of the periastron @xmath24 , orbital period derivative @xmath25 , time dilation and gravitational redshift @xmath26 , and range @xmath27 and shape @xmath28 of the shapiro time delay .",
    "these quantities , in conjunction with the time - variable dispersion measure , a simple time polynomial to model the spin of the pulsar , and astrometric parameters to model the propagation of the signal across the solar system , constitute the free parameters to be fit in the theory - independent timing model .    within the framework of a particular theory of gravity",
    ", the five pk parameters can be written as functions of the pulsar and companion star masses , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the well - determined keplerian parameters .",
    "in general relativity the equations are as follows ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath31 here the masses @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath32 are expressed in solar units , @xmath33s , @xmath34 the newtonian constant of gravity , and @xmath35 the speed of light .",
    "we used the standard tempo analysis software ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo ) together with the jpl  de200 solar - system ephemeris @xcite to perform a least - squares fit of the measured pulse arrival times to the timing model .",
    "results for the astrometric , spin , and dispersion parameters of psr b1534 + 12 are presented in table  [ tab : astspin ] .",
    "the dm was fit in two blocks , pre - and post - upgrade , with different base values and time derivatives in each block . because of systematic errors ( see  [ sec : confidence ] below ) , the mark  iii 430mhz data were only used to fit the pre - upgrade dm and dm derivative , and were not incorporated into the rest of the timing solution .",
    "this meant that an iterative approach was required to find the best - fit dms : first the spin and orbital solution was held constant while the dm parameters were fit using the whole dataset , then the mark  iii 430mhz data were dropped as the best overall timing solution was obtained from the other data , holding the pre - upgrade dm parameters fixed .",
    "this new timing solution was then used to refine both sets of dm parameters , until no significant changes resulted .",
    "the dm and dm - derivative uncertainties reported in table  [ tab : astspin ] are the errors derived while holding the rest of the timing solution fixed .",
    "fitting for post - upgrade dm and dm - derivative simultaneously with the rest of the timing solution yielded similar values , but somewhat larger uncertainties due to covariances with other parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : dmvar ] shows the time variation of the best - fit dm , with the dm and first derivative from paper  i shown for comparison ; the pre - upgrade values are consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "we note that the offset in dm base values between the pre- and post - upgrade fits is due mostly to the use of different standard profiles with necessarily different frequency alignments ; thus this offset should not be interpreted as physically meaningful . the change in dm _ derivative _",
    ", however , is real , and is discussed in  [ sec : dmvar ] below .",
    "an arbitrary time offset was also allowed between the pre- and post - upgrade data sets to accommodate the different standard profiles and changes in the instrumental signal path length .",
    "two models of the pulsar orbit were used to fit the data .",
    "the theory - independent `` dd '' model @xcite treats all five pk parameters defined in  [ sec : model ] as free parameters in the fit .",
    "the alternate `` ddgr '' model @xcite assumes that general relativity is correct and uses equations  [ eq : omdot ] through  [ eq : s ] to tie the pk parameters to @xmath32 and @xmath30 ; consequently it requires only two post - keplerian free parameters .",
    "table  [ tab : orbparms ] presents our best - fit orbital parameters .",
    "uncertainties given in the table are approximately twice the formal `` @xmath36 '' errors from the fit ; we believe them to be conservative estimates of the true 68%-confidence uncertainties , including both random and systematic effects . for each model , we list the keplerian parameters and the relevant post - keplerian parameters .",
    "we also include , in italic numbers , the computed pk parameters derived from the measured masses in the ddgr fit ; these computed parameters are in excellent agreement with the dd fit values . as in paper",
    "i , the ddgr solution includes the `` excess @xmath37 '' parameter , which accounts for an otherwise unmodeled acceleration resulting from galactic kinematics .",
    "we note that the measured orbital period derivative , @xmath38 , is very close to the sum of the ddgr model s intrinsic value , @xmath39 , and the fitted excess , @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dayres ] shows the post - fit residuals for the pre - upgrade 1400mhz data , and the post - upgrade 1400 and 430mhz data , plotted as functions of date .",
    "interstellar scintillation causes the toa uncertainties to vary somewhat , but in the interest of clarity we have not drawn error bars on these residual plots .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbbin ] illustrates the averaged post - fit residuals for the same datasets , plotted as functions of orbital phase .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , solutions for the fitted parameters of psr  b1534 + 12 , as determined from the pre - upgrade 430mhz data , are biased by small systematic errors in the toas , likely caused by imperfect post - detection dispersion removal combined with variable interstellar scintillation patterns .",
    "these measurements are unreliable at the several microsecond level required for high - precision timing of this pulsar .",
    "one of our major goals in building the princeton mark  iv instrument @xcite was to improve the timing accuracy at low frequencies for fast systems such as psr  b1534 + 12 , by minimizing any dispersion - related systematic errors in toas .",
    "we have determined that the new instrument does indeed appear to have circumvented the residual dispersion problems that plague the mark  iii data at low frequencies . in figure",
    "[ fig : resn ] we follow @xcite and paper  i in examining the statistical properties of the post - fit residuals ( relative to the solution of tables  [ tab : astspin ] and [ tab : orbparms ] ) to see if they `` integrate down '' as @xmath41 when @xmath42 consecutive values are averaged . the pre - upgrade 1400mhz data and both post - upgrade data sets are fairly consistent with the expected slope , while the pre - upgrade 430mhz data deviate significantly .",
    "this confirms that we have been justified in leaving the pre - upgrade 430mhz data out of our preferred timing solution , that these mark  iii 430mhz data indeed contain systematic errors related to the incoherent dispersion removal , and that the new mark  iv instrument greatly reduces these systematics , as we had hoped .",
    "the minimum toa uncertainty requirement mentioned above was introduced to compensate for the small remaining deviations from the @xmath41 law visible in the three good datasets .",
    "the observed @xmath37 is measured in the reference frame of the solar system barycenter , and must be corrected to the center - of - mass frame of the binary pulsar system before it can be compared to the value predicted by gr .",
    "the largest correction is kinematic , involving the relative acceleration of the two reference frames .",
    "it can be broken down into the vertical acceleration in the galactic potential , acceleration in the plane of the galaxy , and an apparent centripetal acceleration due to the transverse velocity of the pulsar binary @xcite : @xmath43 + \\mu^2\\frac{d}{c}.\\ ] ] here @xmath44 is the vertical component of galactic acceleration , @xmath45 and @xmath46 the pulsar s galactic coordinates , @xmath47 and @xmath48 the sun s galactocentric distance and galactic circular velocity , @xmath5 and @xmath49 the pulsar s proper motion and distance , and @xmath50 . as we do not have a precise distance to the pulsar through either a timing or an interferometric parallax measurement ,",
    "the best independent distance estimate still comes from the @xcite model of the free electron content of the galaxy ; this model puts the pulsar at a distance of @xmath51kpc . at this distance the @xcite model of the galactic potential",
    "yields an estimate of @xmath52 .",
    "we assume @xmath53kms@xmath54 and @xmath55kpc , as in @xcite .",
    "then , summing the terms in equation  ( [ eq : gal ] ) and multiplying by @xmath56 , we find the total kinematic bias to be @xmath57 the uncertainty in this correction is dominated by the uncertainty in distance , which is only roughly estimated by the taylor and cordes model . the slight decrease in the uncertainty from that given in paper  i results from an increase by a factor of ten in the precision of the proper motion measurement .",
    "our measurement of the intrinsic rate of orbital period decay is therefore @xmath58 the uncertainty is completely dominated by the uncertainty on the kinematic correction , which is nearly a factor of 4 larger than the measurement uncertainty on @xmath59",
    ". in gr , the orbital period decay due to gravitational radiation damping , @xmath60 , can be predicted from the masses @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( eq .  [ eq : pbdot ] ) , which in turn can be deduced from the high precision measurements of @xmath61 and @xmath26 .",
    "as listed in table  [ tab : orbparms ] , the expected value is @xmath62 as in paper  i , our measured value differs from this prediction , now by some 1.7 standard deviations , and again , assuming that gr is the correct theory of gravity , we can derive the true distance to the pulsar from the `` excess @xmath37 '' parameter and equation  [ eq : gal ] above @xcite .",
    "our improved distance is @xmath63  kpc ( 68% confidence limit ) .",
    "the uncertainty is still dominated by the measurement uncertainty of @xmath64 , rather than uncertainties in the galactic rotation parameters or the acceleration @xmath44 , though the galactic model uncertainties will ultimately limit the distance measurement to a few percent accuracy .",
    "the timing parallax for this system is still not significantly measured , but is constrained to be less than 1.5mas , in good agreement with the gr - derived result .",
    "our new distance result is consistent with the @xmath65kpc determined in paper  i , but we have improved the uncertainty by a factor of 4 .",
    "our previous distance led to a downward revision of the estimated double - neutron - star inspiral rate visible to gravitational - wave observatories such as ligo .",
    "the new measurement leads to a small ( 15% ) increase in the number density of similar systems in the local universe , with the uncertainty now dominated by the uncertain scale height of such binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      as noted in ",
    "[ sec : timing ] , we find a significantly different dm and dm derivative in the post - upgrade era than before the upgrade ( figure  [ fig : dmvar ] ) .",
    "we argue that while the change in reference dm value is largely due to the use of new standard profiles with a slightly different frequency alignment , the difference in the rate of change ( more than a factor of 4 slower since the upgrade ) is physical .",
    "it is true that the profile at both frequencies is undergoing a secular evolution due to geodetic precession of the pulsar s spin axis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stairs _ et al .",
    "_ , in prep . )",
    "and thus one might suspect a contribution to the dm derivative from different temporal evolution at the two observing frequencies .",
    "we explore this possibility by calculating the dm difference between our 1999 may and 2001 june observing campaigns , for the best - fit post - upgrade dm derivative versus the best - fit _ pre-_upgrade dm derivative , finding that if the pre - upgrade dm trend had continued , the 2001 june dm would have been smaller by about 0.0005 @xmath3pc .",
    "this large a difference would imply a difference in offset between the 430mhz and 1400mhz profiles of 10@xmath5s , or 0.27 bins in a 1024-bin profile . by comparing the actual cumulative profiles at these epochs using the same cross - correlation algorithm used to calculate toas",
    ", we estimate that the 4301400mhz offset has shifted by no more than about 0.05 bins . as the toas",
    "are determined by the strong main peak of the pulse and the most noticeable evolution is taking place in the low - level emission near the base of the pulse @xcite this is perhaps not surprising .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed changes in dm slope do represent changes in the structure of the interstellar medium between the earth and the pulsar .    with our current data set ,",
    "it is not possible to construct a satisfactory structure function with which to characterize the length scales of turbulence in the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of strong refractive scintillation at 1400mhz , the high - frequency data set remains quite sparse ( figure  [ fig : dayres ] ) . even though we may use a wider - bandwidth instrument such as the recently commissioned 100-mhz `` wapp '' spectrometer for future 1400mhz observations ,",
    "the broadband nature of the refractive interstellar scintillation may make it difficult to accurately sample the dispersion measure variations with resolution finer than roughly 6 months .",
    "the best mass estimates for the two neutron stars in the psr  b1534 + 12 system come from the ddgr timing model .",
    "the measured values are @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the masses derived from the dd model and equations  [ eq : r ] and [ eq : s ] are in good agreement with these values , though the measurement uncertainties are much larger ( figure  [ fig : chisq ] ) .",
    "although the masses of the two neutron stars are very similar , it is now clear that the pulsar is significantly less massive than its companion .",
    "this is contrary to initial expectations from binary evolution .",
    "the pulsar is rapidly spinning , and has the low magnetic field characteristic of a `` recycled pulsar '' that has been spun - up by mass transfer from a companion star . assuming a monotonic relation between progenitor mass and neutron star mass",
    ", we therefore might predict that the pulsar would be more massive at birth , and that the mass difference would only increase during the later evolution of the system .",
    "this perhaps naive prediction has already been challenged by the binary pulsar system psr  b2303 + 46 .",
    "recently , the companion in this close , eccentric binary was shown to be a white dwarf rather than a second neutron star @xcite .",
    "the eccentric orbit implies that the white dwarf formed first , from the star that was originally more massive .",
    "presumably , mass transfer to the initially less massive star pushed it above the minimum mass needed to form a supernova and a neutron star .",
    "a similar process may have been important in the formation of the psr  b1534 + 12 system . although the pulsar was formed from the initially more massive star , mass transfer to its companion star probably resulted in a mass inversion before either neutron star was formed .    to move beyond the simplest ( or most naive ) predictions about the relative masses of the pulsar and companion in the b1534 + 12 system",
    "requires significant improvements in our theoretical understanding of several areas of stellar and binary evolution .",
    "first , we must understand the relationship between progenitor and neutron star masses , which may not be purely monotonic .",
    "then we must understand how the mass lost by the pulsar s progenitor or gained by the companion s progenitor affected the evolution of the stellar cores and the amount of fallback during the supernova events .",
    "finally , we must understand in some detail the mass transfer that spun up the pulsar .",
    "although these are all challenging problems , there is some hope for future guidance from the growing number of precisely measured neutron star masses .",
    "psr  b1534 + 12 permits the second test of general relativity based on the @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and @xmath37 parameters of a binary pulsar system , and adds significant measurements of the shapiro - delay parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the left - hand sides of equations  ( [ eq : omdot][eq : s ] ) represent quantities measured in a theory - independent fashion and listed in the dd column of table  [ tab : orbparms ] .",
    "if gr is consistent with these measurements and there are no significant unmodeled effects , the five curves corresponding to equations  ( [ eq : omdot][eq : s ] ) should intersect at a single point in the @xmath29-@xmath30 plane .",
    "these curves are presented in figure  [ fig : massmass ] , in which a pair of lines delimit the 68% confidence limit for each pk parameter ( a single line is drawn for @xmath24 , whose uncertainty is too small to show ) .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 curves intersect , though @xmath27 is still poorly measured .",
    "the curve obtained from the observed dd value of @xmath37 can be made to intersect the others , as discussed above , by setting the pulsar distance to @xmath2kpc rather than the @xmath51kpc estimated from the dispersion measure . a filled circle at @xmath68 marks the ddgr solution of table  [ tab : orbparms ] , and its location on the @xmath24 line agrees to within 0.05% with the measured dd values of @xmath26 and @xmath28 .",
    "this provides a highly precise test of the validity of general relativity using only non - radiative timing parameters , an important complement to the mixed @xmath24@xmath26@xmath37 test provided by psr  b1913 + 16 .",

    "<S> we have continued our long term study of the double - neutron - star binary pulsar psr  b1534 + 12 , using new instrumentation to make very high precision measurements at the arecibo observatory . </S>",
    "<S> we have significantly improved our solution for the astrometric , spin , and orbital parameters of the system , as well as for the five `` post - keplerian '' orbital parameters that can be used to test gravitation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in good agreement with the predictions of general relativity .    with the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity in the classical regime , our measurements allow us to determine the masses of the pulsar and its companion neutron star with high accuracy : @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the small but significant mass difference is difficult to understand in most evolutionary models , as the pulsar is thought to have been born first from a more massive progenitor star and then undergone a period of mass accretion before the formation of the second neutron star .    </S>",
    "<S> psr  b1534 + 12 has also become a valuable probe of the local interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we have now measured the pulsar distance to be @xmath2  kpc , giving a mean electron density along this line of sight of 0.011@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we continue to measure a gradient in the dispersion measure , though the rate of change is now slower than in the first years after the pulsar s discovery . </S>"
