    "the hilbert space of four spins with a vanishing total @xmath2-component is thus equivalent to the space of two hard core bosons distributed among four spatial locations with at most one boson per site .",
    "the state shown is thus in one - to - one correspondence with the state shown in part ( a ) of the figure , but the quantum degree of freedom is here associated with the occupation of the sites , _",
    "i.e. _ , by the spatial location of physical particles , rather than by the internal spin degree of freedom of space fixed particles .",
    "note that it is a natural property of this representation that a single particle occupying an odd superposition state of two lattice locations is equivalent to an entangled spin singlet state of the corresponding two spin @xmath1 particles .    in @xcite , the analogy of the hard core boson occupation degree of freedom and the spin 1/2 internal states",
    "is discussed in detail , and it is proposed how laser double well potentials along two spatial directions can be used to define the plaquette and how tuning of the on - site interaction and the tunneling of particles may be used to engineer at will a variety of different states in both the spin and in the hard core boson representation .",
    "it is for example possible to allow tunneling with amplitude @xmath3 along the 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 bonds , causing a super exchange interaction @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the projection operator on the spin singlet state of spins @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 the on - site interaction energy .",
    "the product state of @xmath10 and @xmath11 spin singlets is then gapped from all other states of the four spins , and by lowering the potential barrier in the orthogonal direction and thus increasing the tunneling amplitude , @xmath12 , along the 1 - 4 and 2 - 3 bonds , one provides a hamiltonian @xmath13 which adiabatically connects the product state of two simple spin singlets with one of the rvb states . in the hard core boson representation ( removing the spin down particles ) the rvb state of the remaining two spin up particles is also equivalent to the laughlin state , and in @xcite it is proposed how further use of external inhomogeneous perturbations can engineer quasi - particle excited states and simulate their anyonic behavior associated with the excitations being propagated around all corners of the plaquette .",
    "instead of coding memory bits into separate particles , it has been proposed to approach scalability of quantum information processing by making use of the rich internal level structure found in many atomic and molecular quantum systems @xcite . in these proposals",
    "it is suggested to use ensembles of identical particles and to encode quantum information in symmetric states of the ensemble with different values of the collective population of the different internal atomic or molecular states . to be more specific , an arbitrary @xmath14-bit register state @xmath15 , with @xmath16 ,",

    "( b ) . ]",
    "the system may be initialized with all atoms prepared in the state @xmath25 , e.g. , by optical pumping , and provided the lasers and other means used to excite and control the ensemble act identically on all atoms , the state will retain its permutation symmetry for all times . note that for atoms at rest , e.g. , trapped in an optical lattice potential , phase factors @xmath26 arising from travelling wave laser fields which excite the atoms at their different spatial locations can be absorbed in a redefinition of the atomic internal state coherences . to force the system to remain in the subspace of meaningful quantum register states we propose to apply the rydberg blockade mechanism @xcite , which uses the strong long - range interaction between highly excited atoms and the associated energy shifts to prevent atoms in the vicinity of an already excited neighbor from being transferred into a rydberg state . for a review of quantum information processing ideas with rydberg excited atoms and relevant physical parameters ,",
    "see @xcite .    in an ensemble of atoms , which are all within reach of these strong interactions , extending out to 10  @xmath27 m separation , a resonant laser process towards a definite rydberg state may produce an excited superposition state @xmath28 in which all atoms are excited with the same probability amplitude , but the laser field resonant with a single rydberg excitation is detuned for states with two or more rydberg excited atoms because of the interaction energy between excited atoms .",
    "taking advantage of this mechanism one can drive precisely one atom from the initially macroscopically populated state @xmath25 , via a rydberg state @xmath29 , into an initially empty internal state , and thus prepare a collective state with precisely one atom or no atom in any of the register states @xmath30 .",
    "the coherent excitation towards the rydberg state may be terminated so that a superposition of a state with zero and one rydberg atom is produced , and in this way , we can prepare quantum superposition states of the qubit register .",
    "the excitation to a rydberg level from one internal state can also prevent excitation from another internal state , and in this way two - qubit entangling operations can be implemented through the same mechanism @xcite . in fact , the universal power of the collective encoding quantum computing allows us to synthesize any state and to implement any unitary transformation within the atomic ensemble .",
    "it is important to point out , that the operations mentioned are carried out by collective addressing , and the exciting laser pulses only need to be adjusted to the transition frequencies , the coupling strengths and the polarization selection rules of the atomic transitions .",
    "a practical implementation in alkali atoms may thus apply a homogeneous magnetic field , which splits the different zeeman sublevels of the atomic hyperfine ground state structure , and thus the excitation towards the rydberg states and lower lying optically excited states can be made state specific via the transition frequencies @xcite .",
    "we noted already that the universal quantum computing capacity of the collective coding scheme and the rydberg blockade mechanism permit the generation of any state of the system . in this subsection",
    "we wish to point out that some states are actually more easily synthesized in an alternative manner than by processing a sequence of binary logic quantum gates . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ plaquette ] , a single hard core boson in an odd superposition state of two spatial locations is equivalent to a spin singlet state , _",

    "with our collective encoding in fig .",
    "[ two ] , we similarly observe that a logical state like @xmath31 with one atom in state 1 , and no atoms in the other register states , can be transformed into any superposition @xmath32 by simply applying ( raman ) laser fields onto the entire ensemble that transfer non - interacting atoms from the internal state @xmath33 into the superposition @xmath34",
    ".    it may seem puzzling that without use of any interaction between the atoms , it is possible to turn a classical register state into a quantum state corresponding to entangled qubits . in registers with individual quantum systems encoding of the different qubits",
    "such operations require direct or indirect interactions between the particles .",
    "but we recall that the `` classical '' register state @xmath31 is indeed a multi - particle entangled w - state of the atomic ensemble , where every atom has the same amplitude to populate the internal state @xmath33 .",
    "we observe that this atom - atom entanglement can be freely transformed into qubit - qubit entanglement within the register subspace of only a single bit value of unity .",
    "while we need the rydberg blockade to manipulate the collective population between zero and unity in the register states , in the conventional encoding , one - bit unitary gates do not need any interaction .    for our purpose",
    ", it follows from the above that pairs of spin singlets of spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 are readily obtained from the state shown in fig .",
    "[ two ] by simple raman processes , while the superposition of @xmath35 and @xmath36 singlet pairs in the rvb states could be non - trivial two - particle states and hence deserve special attention",
    ". we will now present a general criterion for which two - atom states can be transformed into each other by simple raman processes , i.e. , by simple linear transformations on the single atom level structure .",
    "symmetric collective states of @xmath37 atoms with two atoms in the register states may be conveniently represented as @xmath38 where the @xmath39 operators are bosonic creation operators of an atom in level @xmath6 .",
    "the bosonic property does not rely on the use of bosonic atoms in the ensemble , but merely reflects the permutation symmetry among the atoms .",
    "@xmath40 is a matrix of coefficients determining the state , and for uniqueness , we require @xmath41 . a raman transition between levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 may refer to the same level ) is described by a single atom hamiltonian @xmath42 which gives rise to the multi - atom , second quantized hamiltonian @xmath43 . in the heisenberg picture ,",
    "this hamiltonian causes a linear transformation among the bosonic creation operators , and by choosing suitable combinations of raman transitions , it is possible to implement any linear transformation of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath9 is a unitary matrix ( the unitarity preserves the bosonic commutator relations @xmath45=\\delta_{ij}$ ] ) .",
    "this transformation transforms the ensemble state @xmath46 into @xmath47 we can thus transform a symmetric ensemble state @xmath46 with expansion coefficients @xmath40 into a state with coefficients @xmath48 without interatomic interactions if and only if we can find a unitary matrix @xmath9 so that @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the transpose .    according to the takagi decomposition @xcite , it is always possible to write an @xmath51 complex symmetric matrix @xmath52 as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a unitary matrix and @xmath55 is a real nonnegative diagonal matrix .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath55 are the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath56 and the column vectors of @xmath54 are a set of orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath56 .",

    "this simple analysis is useful to assess which gate implementation of quantum algorithms can be most easily carried out in the collective coding scheme , e.g. , on remote , non - interacting particles . in the next section",
    "we will apply the criterion and find simple means to produce different plaquette states .",
    "as specific examples , let us assume @xmath63 and consider the hard core boson states equivalent with spin singlet superposition states by the identification of the spin singlet creation operator @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 these are the resonating valence bond states of the simple plaquette described in @xcite .",

    "we can still , however , use our mapping criterion , and , e.g. , verify that the state @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 is the state with two atoms in level @xmath33 ) leads to the eigenvalues @xmath69 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 . choosing @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we thus find the same eigenvalues as for @xmath76 .",

    "[ phiplus ] . in part ( c ) of the figure",
    ", we use a composite pulse sequence consisting of three pulses with constant amplitude and phase , which was proposed in @xcite . the ability to control the transfer of the atom in the rydberg level into @xmath33 dependent on whether @xmath33 is initially populated by one or zero atoms ( ( c ) to ( d ) in the figure ) stems from the fact that the transition between a ground state level and a rydberg level , due to the blockade effect , acts as a two - state transition with a rabi frequency proportional to the square root of the total number of atoms occupying the two levels .",
    "the rabi frequency on the @xmath33 to @xmath29 transition is thus a factor of @xmath90 larger in the former case than in the latter case .",
    "we also investigated whether the transformation achieved with the composite pulse sequence could be achieved with only two pulses , but restricting the parameters so that the transfer is perfect for the state with no atoms in @xmath33 initially , we obtained a numerical maximum of the transfer fidelity for the state with one atom in @xmath33 initially of 0.7337 .",
    "the three pulse scheme is hence necessary .",
    "we note here the convenience of using an intermediate state , which has double occupancy of a single atomic level and hence does not belong to the class of hard core boson states .",
    "we imagine , that further exploration of the ladders of occupation number eigenstates may lead to a variety of schemes for efficient state synthesis and manipulation .",
    "excitations of topological states correspond to anyonic quasiparticles , and we next describe a method to demonstrate the phase factor that arises when two such anyons are created and one is moved around the other one .",
    "note that our qubits are not localized in space , but we may nevertheless regard the process as braiding due to the analogy between our system and a plaquette in an optical lattice . as in @xcite ,",
    "we consider the state @xmath91 which is a minimum instance of a string - net condensate . if two rydberg levels @xmath29 and @xmath92 are available and the presence of a single atom in @xmath29 shifts the energy of @xmath92 significantly , this state can be prepared from @xmath93 as follows .",

    "we can , for instance , choose the raman pulses to apply the transformation @xmath156 \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } 1&0&0\\\\ 0&\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}&\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\ 0&-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}&\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] in the basis @xmath151 .",
    "this transforms our three states @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 into @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "a measurement of the state of the qubit represented by level @xmath72 should thus always result in the outcome ` 0 ' , while @xmath160 is transformed into @xmath161 , which populates level @xmath72 with certainty .",
    "spinon excitations of the above kind with spin singlet pairs of two out of three possible spins ( and a random state of the uncoupled spin ) have recently occurred as candidate states for reference frame - free quantum key distribution @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed to prepare and demonstrate basic properties of minimum instances of topological matter in collective excitations of a small atomic ensemble .",
    "state manipulation is achieved by application of the rydberg blockade mechanism and raman transitions between different atomic levels . in particular",
    ", a number of transformations that may be difficult to carry out on individually selected atoms and pairs of atoms in an optical lattice can be achieved in our system simply by application of uniform raman pulses on the entire sample .",
    "we have provided a general criterion to determine whether two states with two excitations each can be transformed into each other only by application of raman processes , and we have used this result to derive simple schemes to prepare and manipulate a number of topological states .",
    "experiments on rydberg blockade have recently demonstrated controlled two - qubit gates between two atoms @xcite , and we hope that the present work will provide inspiration for future experiments demonstrating few qubit minimum instances of topological matter . using more internal levels of the atoms and possibly more atomic ensembles ,",
    "our scheme can also be extended to generation of topological states of a larger number of qubits . as discussed further in @xcite ,",
    "holmium atoms are particularly suitable for this purpose , since they have 128 hyperfine ground state levels .    following the proposal in @xcite , the states @xmath162 prepared in collective states of the order of a thousand atoms",
    "can be effectively converted into @xmath14 well collimated wave packets with @xmath24 photons in the @xmath6th packet .",
    "our medium may hence serve as a deterministic source of multi - mode field states with a potential of carrying the topological quantum correlations over long distances .",
    "we believe that with the potentially high rate of successful generation , the ability to readily create states of higher complexity than a single plaquette , and also the possibility to either absorb the photon states again in another ensemble or interfere them with the deterministic output from another atomic ensemble , the atomic ensemble collective coding is a serious candidate for a quantum repeater for quantum communication protocols with toric code qubit protection @xcite .",
    "finally , we recall that within the collective encoding scheme , we use the rydberg blockade to restrict the occupation of the internal register states to the qubit values zero and unity .",
    "higher population of these states can also be controlled corresponding to higher spin systems and oscillators , for which the plaquette systems offer a wide range of interesting topological effects  even in the case of coherent states of oscillators , corresponding to classical fields in optics @xcite , and to entirely non - interacting particles driven by independent raman transitions in our atomic ensembles ."
