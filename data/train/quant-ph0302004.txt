    "the physical system studied in this paper is an atom in a polarizable ground state near a conducting wall .",
    "the interaction of the atom with the quantum electromagnetic field ( emf ) vacuum , whose spatial modes are restricted by the wall with imposed boundary conditions , generates a force that pulls it toward the conducting wall ( for general discussion see ref .",
    "the details of such a force is important in any experiments and applications in which an atom is held near a surface by a trapping scheme using evanescent waves or magnetic fields .",
    "the atom - wall force is divisible into two parts .",
    "first , there is the electrostatic attraction that the atom feels toward its image on the other side of the wall , called the van  der  waals ( vdw ) force .",
    "second is a quantum mechanical modification of the vdw force first calculated by casimir and polder  @xcite .",
    "they dubbed the quantum modification `` retardation '' of the vdw force , because its source is the non - instantaneous transverse emf .",
    "extensions of casimir and polder s results for a polarizable atom were later derived by many authors  @xcite , including for an atom in a cavity  @xcite and near a dielectric wall  @xcite .",
    "closest in philosophy to what is done in this paper is the work of milonni in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", the author computes the second order alteration of the emf mode functions due to the presence of the atom , from which the ground state energy shift is the expectation value of the interaction hamiltonian in the altered vacuum .",
    "however , the author neglects time dependence in the mode functions and thus neglects effects due to doppler shifts of the emf modes .",
    "recently , retardation correction of the vdw force has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "verification of the casimir - polder force can be viewed as a demonstration of the entangled quantum behavior of the entire system , since it involves the dressing of the atom by the emf vacuum .",
    "although casimir and polder and others calculations do treat the quantum entanglement in the system , analysis up to now has been restricted to stationary atoms .",
    "it has been assumed ( wrongly , as we shall show ) that such a method can also treat the adiabatic motion of the atom .",
    "adiabatic motion means in this context that as the atom moves , it continuously shifts into the position dependent stationary dressed ground state on a timescale much shorter than the timescale of motion .",
    "treatments assuming that the atom is stationary or is instantaneously static exclude correlations that are developed in the system during the motion .",
    "the key point is that the adiabatic and stationary dressed vacuum states are not the same .",
    "an example where this situation is encountered generically and dealt with in depth is in cosmology , specifically , quantum field processes in an expanding universe  @xcite .",
    "for stationary systems a vacuum state is well defined at all times ( due to the existence of a killing vector ) , but not for arbitrary dynamics , especially fast motion . however , for slow dynamics , adiabatic vacuum states can be defined and renormalization procedures constructed  @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic method we use here is similar in spirit ( though not in substance , as our purpose is somewhat different from that in cosmology ) .",
    "to predict motional effects , entanglement in the evolution needs to be accounted for theoretically .",
    "we use the influence functional ( if ) method here , which keeps track of full coherence in the evolution to derive the force between the atom and the wall while allowing the atom to move adiabatically . in the case of a stationary atom ,",
    "our result is in exact agreement with the casimir - polder force . in the case of an adiabatically moving atom , we find a coherent retardation correction up to twice the stationary value , thus our coherent qed calculation will make verifiable predictions .",
    "this paper shows the derivation and explains the cause due to coherent back - action .",
    "section ii outlines the model and details of the calculation .",
    "the results for stationary and adiabatic motion are then given in section iii , and discussed in section iv .",
    "in contrast to obtaining the force via the gradient of the ground state energy shift , we obtain it through the expectation value of an atom s center of mass ( com ) momentum .",
    "our system consists of an atom placed near a conducting wall .",
    "we assume an initially factorized state of the atom in its ground state and the emf in its vacuum .",
    "a path integral technique is used to derive the ground state - emf vacuum transition amplitude of the evolving system .",
    "inclusion of coherent back - action allows the system to self - dress  @xcite and preserves maximal entanglement in the non - markovian evolution of an atom - emf quantum system .",
    "the expectation value of the momentum operator is then computed . in the path",
    "integral , grassmannian and bosonic coherent states are used to label the atomic and emf degrees of freedom , respectively . the position and momentum basis are used for the atom s center of mass degree of freedom .",
    "the major approximation applied here is a second order vertex approximation . with the second order vertex , the propagator is partially resummed to all orders of the coupling constant .",
    "the result is a non - perturbative propagator which yields coherent long time dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the atom and the size of its external wavepacket are kept finite throughout the calculation . only at the end of the calculation",
    "do we allow the mass of the atom to go to infinity and its extension shrunk to a point , while retaining finite terms due to their effect on the dynamics .",
    "highlights of the calculation are given in this section and details are given in the appendices . in section",
    "iia the hamiltonian and spatial mode functions that describe the system are introduced . in section iib the transition amplitude of the emf vacuum with the atom in its ground state is calculated in a coherent state path integral , with an effective action expanded to second order in the coupling ( equivalent to a second order vertex resummation ) , and semiclassically in the com motion .",
    "the momentum expectation value and the retardation correction force is then calculated from the transition amplitude in section iic .",
    "the spinless non - relativistic qed hamiltonian is given by and @xmath0 interaction terms appearing in the minimal coupling form and the @xmath1 and rntgen interaction terms appearing in the multipolar form  @xcite .",
    "a common confusion between the two forms comes about because it is the _ total _ minimal coupling form and the _ total _ multipolar form which are equivalent within a gauge transformation .",
    "if any interaction terms are dropped in either form of the hamiltonian ( e.g. the @xmath2 or rntgen terms ) , then the equivalence is broken .",
    "dropping interaction terms can also cause erroneous results in the computation of physical quantities  @xcite . desiring to avoid this pitfall ,",
    "we have been careful to use the _ total _ minimal coupling form , without dropping any interaction terms .",
    "there is , however , one issue with our use of the minimal coupling form . only in the multipolar form",
    "are the internal and external degrees of freedom exactly separable .",
    "that is especially important in bound systems of charged particles in which the masses of the particles are commensurate .",
    "however , since the bound system in our study is an atom , for which the nuclear mass dominates over the mass of the electrons , the atomic and electronic degrees of freedom are well separated and the use of the minimal coupling hamiltonian is justified . ]",

    "however , since in this case both the anti - resonant as well as resonant rotating wave terms are included in the hamiltonian ( i.e. , no rwa ) , the variational equations for the grassmann variables will have bosonic sources even when the emf is taken to be in the vacuum .",

    "the energy gradient approach can be described as a kinematic approach since the atom - emf system is assumed to be held static in its entangled dressed ground state .",
    "the self - dressing approach used here , on the other hand , allows the atom - emf entanglement to evolve dynamically .",
    "that is , the atom and emf system , beginning in a factorized state , evolves into a stationary dressed state ( i.e. it self - dresses ) . when the atom is stationary the two forces match because after some time to get acquainted , the self - dressing atom does indeed evolve into the stationary dressed state .",
    "it should be stressed that the agreement between the results of the two methods demonstrates the coherence of the self - dressing method as applied here .",
    "we now show that the prediction given by the self - dressing method of the retardation correction force for a slowly moving atom differs from the energy gradient prediction .",
    "the key difference is that as a moving atom and the emf get acquainted , they evolve into an entangled dressed state which is different from the stationary atom dressed state .",

    "replacing the taylor expansion by its steady state behavior is adiabatic because it assumes that the expansion terms asymptote to their dressed state form on a timescale much shorter than the timescale on which either the position or velocity of the atom changes .",
    "more specifically , for the change in position , the adiabatic condition means that during a round trip light travel time the atom - wall distance has very little relative change , @xmath79 , which is equivalent to the condition that the atomic velocity be non - relativistic , @xmath80 similarly , the adiabatic condition for the change in velocity is that it has very little relative change during a round trip light travel time , @xmath81 , which can be restated as the net force not changing the kinetic energy of the atom much during a light travel time , @xmath82 since @xmath83 is the power that the net force puts into the atoms mechanical motion .",

    "our approach provides an interpretation of how a net force arises from the emission - reabsorption processes in the presence of a boundary .",

    "once the stationary retardation force is understood in terms of the wall effect on the virtual photon cloud , the modification of it for an adiabatically moving atom can be interpreted as part of the doppler effect .",
    "the effect is easiest to explain in the reference frame of the atom , in which it is the wall which will be moving toward or away from the atom .",
    "then , as in the stationary case , the virtual photon cloud will be altered by reflection off the wall .",
    "however , in the case of the moving wall , the reflected photons will be doppler shifted due to the walls motion . in the language of the virtual photon cloud , the distribution of photons around a moving atom",
    "will be doppler shifted .",
    "this shift builds up in the photon cloud much like charge in a capacitor connected to a loop of wire in a changing magnetic field , and it can only be discharged through absorption into the atom .",
    "the net effect , over the retardation force , will be to push the atom against such built up doppler shift , back to its original point of release .",
    "a situation in which the motional modification of the retardation correction will be important is for the reflection of cold atoms off the evanescent field of an otherwise totally internally reflected laser beam .",
    "for example , in a recent experiment by landragin et .",
    "@xcite , cold alkali atoms are dropped onto a crystal with an evanescent wave running along the surface . the atom - wall interaction pulls the atoms towards the wall .",
    "the dipole potential of the evanescent wave , on the other hand , causes a repulsion of the atoms from the crystal .",
    "the combination of those two creates a barrier through which some fraction of the atoms tunnel and the rest reflect back out .",
    "the authors measure the fraction of reflected atoms versus the barrier height . as the barrier height",
    "is lowered it will at some point drop below the energy of the incoming atoms . at that point",
    ", all the atoms will be able to classically roll over the barrier , and no atoms will be reflected .",
    "the evanescent laser power required to reach that barrier height depends sensitively on the the atom - wall attraction .",
    "by comparison of measurement with theory , the authors show that the electrostatic attraction alone does not accurately predict the threshold laser power .",
    "they show that the prediction of a retardation corrected force is closer to the measured value . when we combine the motional modification to the retardation correction we are able to make a further modified prediction for the threshold .",
    "the calculations done in this paper are for a perfect conductor , not a dielectric boundary , so the modifications predicted here should not be applied directly to the case of a dielectric boundary .",
    "however , a general statement can be made that a coherent qed correction will cause a lowered prediction for the threshold laser power , since it will tend to decrease the atom - wall attraction .",
    "if one naively applies a dielectric factor to our result for the conducting plate to compensate for the difference , the present prediction for the threshold energy ( 14.8 @xmath111 ) is close to the measured value ( 14.9 @xmath111 ) .",
    "extension of the present work to a dielectric wall is ongoing .",
    "another experiment which has been able to observe the retardation of the van  der  waals force involves a stream of ground state atoms passing between two plates  @xcite . due to the attraction of the atoms toward the plates ,",
    "some of the atoms fall onto and stick to the plates .",
    "the fraction of atoms that pass through the gap depends on the atom - wall potential . by measuring the opacity ( fraction of atoms that do not pass through ) for different gap widths , the authors probe the attractive atom - wall potential",
    "this experiment holds less promise of observing a coherent qed correction to the retardation , than the previous example .",
    "the reason being that in this experiment the atoms first come into interaction with the walls at a distance of only a few resonant atomic wavelengths .",
    "the atom and emf thus do not have as much motion over which to develop a coherent effect .",
    "within that caveat , a general prediction can be made that the coherent correction will tend to decrease the opacity .",
    "our result exactly reproduces the lamb shift result for a stationary atom . for an adiabatically slowly moving atom , a correction due to the doppler shift is found .",
    "our result for the retardation correction for adiabatic motion is up to twice as much as that computed for stationary atoms .",
    "agreement with the energy gradient result in the stationary atom case shows that our non - perturbative approach captures the effects of entanglement which we sought .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the atom - emf system evolves from an initially factorizable bare state into the interacting hamiltonian ground state , which is an entangled state in the free hamiltonian basis .",
    "this process is known as self - dressing .",
    "the correction for a slowly moving atom shows how our approach can go beyond lamb shift calculations .",
    "the correction is due to the doppler shift in that the virtual photon cloud which dresses the atom is shifted .",
