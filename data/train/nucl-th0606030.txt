    "study of the elastic electron - proton scattering @xmath3 is an important source of information about the proton structure . in the first order of the perturbation theory ( pt ) or born approximation the reaction amplitude @xmath4",
    "is expressed in terms of dirac and pauli proton form factors ( ffs ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 { q^\\nu \\over 4m},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 are 4-spinors of incoming and outgoing particles , @xmath12 is fine structure constant , @xmath13 is the momentum transfer from the electron to the proton .",
    "the linear combinations , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , called the electric and magnetic ffs , are also widely used .    during many years",
    "it was a common practice to extract ffs by the rosenbluth separation method .",
    "ffs obtained by this method obey with good accuracy @xmath16 for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . however since 2000",
    "series of experiments was done using an alternative , polarization transfer method @xcite .",
    "these experiments yielded strikingly different results : @xmath19 ratio decreased linearly with @xmath2 .",
    "since both methods are based on the born approximation , the reason for discrepancy is likely the neglected higher order pt terms .",
    "there are two types of second order feynman diagrams : first , diagrams , involving an exchange of only one virtual photon ( vacuum polarization or vertex corrections ) and second , two photon exchange or box diagram , fig.[sbox](a ) .",
    "the part of amplitude , coming from one - photon exchange diagrams , has the structure similar to ( [ 1ph ] ) ( certainly with another functions in place of @xmath20 ) and can not lead to the discrepancy between two methods .",
    "such diagrams are usually taken into account in experimental analyses",
    ".    therefore the two photon exchange diagram plays the key role in understanding the experimental results and extracting correct ff values .    the lower part of the diagram represents the doubly virtual compton scattering ( vvcs ) off the proton .",
    "the amplitude of vvcs has two poles which are due to single proton in the intermediate state .",
    "the contribution of these poles to the box diagram is called the elastic contribution .",
    "similar contributions appear from @xmath21 and other resonances , fig.[sbox ] . in the present paper",
    "we study the elastic contribution only ( diagrams fig.[sbox](b ) and ( c ) , which we later on call box ( in the narrow sense ) and x - box diagrams ) .",
    "we also believe that the method derived here can be applied , with minor modifications , to the contributions of resonances",
    ". this will be the subject of a separate paper .    in previously published papers",
    "the box diagram was calculated in several , more or less approximate ways .",
    "first is the soft photon approximation used in tsai s paper @xcite ( and also in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is assumed that the main contribution to the loop integral comes from the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 regions .",
    "the reason is usually given that the integrand is strongly peaked at that points because of the infrared ( ir ) singularity .",
    "however , only the ir divergent part ( which exactly cancels in the final answer ) , can be calculated in such a way .",
    "instead , we are interested here in the ir finite part , and it is by no means obvious , that the main contribution to it comes from the same regions .    the second way , which may be called `` hard photon approximation '' , assumes the most important region to be @xmath26 @xcite . this may be a reasonable assumption , however we believe it needs justification . in ref.@xcite , after making the approximation the loop integral becomes divergent and an ultraviolet cut - off is inserted by hand .    in the third group of papers",
    "the loop integral was calculated exactly , however using the special ff parameterization , monopole ff in ref.@xcite and the sum of monopoles in ref.@xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are fitted constants .",
    "thanks to this simple form , the resulting integrals are expressed through 4- and 3-point functions , which were calculated numerically using computer program .    however , such sort of calculation has the following problem .",
    "since the ffs , entering the integral , are not known from the first principles , we should use some model for them or fit to experiment .",
    "the problem is that only @xmath30 region is accessible for the scattering experiments .",
    "while the @xmath31 region can , in principle , be studied in @xmath32 reaction , the unphysical region @xmath33 is completely inaccessible .",
    "but the loop integral involves ffs in the time - like region ( @xmath34 ) as well .",
    "a natural question arises , how the ( largely unknown ) ff behaviour for @xmath34 influences the total result .",
    "in particular , parameterization used in ref.@xcite does not even roughly reproduce ffs in the @xmath34 region .",
    "indeed , unitarity requires that ffs have poles at @xmath35 where @xmath36 are masses of vector mesons , namely @xmath37- , @xmath38- and @xmath39- mesons ( neglecting their widths ) .",
    "but the numerical values given in ref.@xcite are away from these masses .",
    "so , the fit is not suitable for @xmath34 and the results of ref.@xcite can not be considered reliable before answering the above question .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in the present paper we calculate the box and x - box diagrams in the most rigorous way .",
    "first , contrary to @xcite we evaluate all integrals exactly , without any restriction of the integration domain .",
    "second , contrary to @xcite we do not use any special assumptions on the ffs functional form . we perform the analytical integration to the maximal possible extent , resulting in @xmath40 where @xmath41 is explicitly known . during the derivation of ( [ res ] ) we perform wick rotation of the integration path , which is possible due to ff analyticity . as a result , the integration is done over negative @xmath42 and @xmath43 only .",
    "therefore we overcome the above - mentioned problem of finding out ff values at @xmath34 .",
    "now the experimentally measured ffs can be used directly for the calculation of ( [ res ] ) .",
    "then we calculate two photon exchange amplitudes numerically using different ff parameterizations and discuss the results .",
    "the box and x - box diagrams , as well as notation for particle momenta , are displayed in fig.[twophot ] .",
    "thin line is for electron , thick is for proton .",
    "the proton and electron masses are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we also denote @xmath46 the following relations are fulfilled : @xmath47 upper sign is for the box , lower is for the x - box diagram .    the amplitude corresponding to either of diagrams is @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 is defined by ( [ gamma ] ) and we use the notation @xmath51 . for the x - box diagram one should interchange @xmath52 with @xmath53 in eq.([n ] ) .",
    "the `` photon mass '' @xmath54 is introduced in the denominator to avoid ir divergence .",
    "though the electron mass is small compared to the characteristic energies involved , we will not neglect it in the denominator , first , for generality , second , since , as it is seen from the result , each of the diagrams diverges like @xmath55 as @xmath56 ( but their sum does not ) .    in general case",
    "the elastic @xmath0 scattering is described by six invariant amplitudes .",
    "however three of them are proportional to @xmath45 , so in the @xmath57 limit remain only three @xcite : @xmath58 { q_\\nu \\over 4 m } +   \\tilde f_3   \\hat k { p^\\mu \\over m^2 }   \\right ) u.\\ ] ] the invariant amplitudes @xmath59 depend on two kinematic variables , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in the first order of pt @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the contribution of the box diagram to any of these amplitudes is given by the integral , similar to ( [ intbox ] ) , but with another numerator , @xmath65 where @xmath66 are some ( rather cumbersome ) explicitly known scalar polynomial functions of @xmath67 .",
    "to simplify the notation , from now on we drop the sum sign and the summation indices in the expressions like ( [ num ] ) and write them simply as @xmath68 .",
    "however the summation is always understood .",
    "there are at most four independent scalar functions of @xmath67 , say , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( the pseudoscalar combination @xmath73 can not appear because of the parity considerations ) .",
    "the alternative , more convenient choice is @xmath74 upper sign is for the box , lower is for the x - box diagram . since @xmath66 are polynomials in @xmath67 , they can also be written as polynomials in four variables ( [ vars ] ) .",
    "now it is easy to see that the integral ( [ intbox ] ) can be reduced to the four basic integrals : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a polynomial , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 if the maximal power of @xmath79 or @xmath80 in @xmath81 is greater than one , then other integrals can appear in the decomposition of ( [ intbox ] ) .",
    "however , they are expressed through ( [ int2 ] ) using symmetry considerations , see appendix  [ appa ] .    for the x - box diagram the integrals @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , are the same as for the box diagram , but the integral @xmath85 is not , since the relation between @xmath67 and @xmath86 is different .",
    "we denote the corresponding integral @xmath87 .",
    "we will show here in detail the evaluation of the integral @xmath85 .",
    "other integrals are evaluated similarly . at the end",
    "we write down the results for all of them .",
    "as it was discussed previously , the idea is to integrate over two of four integration variables , to obtain @xmath88 with an explicitly known functions @xmath89 .",
    "this expression can be used for numerical integration or further analysis .",
    "we will perform the calculation in the breit frame . in this frame",
    "we have @xmath90 ( the first is the time component , the following are @xmath91- , @xmath92- , and @xmath93- components ) . let also @xmath94 so @xmath95 . in this notation",
    "@xmath96 we are to calculate the following integral : @xmath97 first we integrate over @xmath98 . the only quantity that does depend on @xmath98",
    "is @xmath99 . using @xmath100",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath101 in eq.([defsqrt ] ) and further the following convention is used : we mean by @xmath102 the analytic function of @xmath93 with the branch cut from @xmath103 to @xmath104 such that @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108",
    ". consequently , eq.([kphi ] ) implies , that if @xmath109 is real , it has the same sign as the expression in the brackets under the radical .",
    "the integral becomes @xmath110        next we will integrate over @xmath111 .",
    "here we intend to use wick rotation , so we need to study the analytic properties of the integrand . the ffs @xmath112 ( and thus @xmath113 ) are analytic functions of @xmath114 everywhere in the physical sheet except the positive real axis .",
    "namely , ffs have branch cuts running from @xmath115 to @xmath116 ( @xmath117 is the pion mass ) @xcite , and the additional pole at @xmath118 is due to the photon propagator ; the physical value is @xmath119 . in the complex @xmath111 plane",
    "the corresponding singularities lie at @xmath120 .",
    "the factor @xmath121 has two poles _ 1 _ and _ 2 _ at @xmath122 and @xmath109 has two branch cuts _ 3 _ and _ 4 _ running from @xmath123 to @xmath124 . when integrating over @xmath111 , we must pass by these singularities adding @xmath125 to the masses in the usual way .",
    "the resulting integration path @xmath126 is shown in fig.[path ] on the left .",
    "now we perform the wick rotation to superpose the integration path with the imaginary axis . if the singularities _ 1 _ and _ 3 _ lie at @xmath127 and _ 2 _ and _ 4 _ lie at @xmath128 , then the integration path can be rotated without crossing them , fig.[path ] , upper drawing . while singularities _ 2 _ and _ 3 _ always fulfill the above condition , it may not hold for _ 1 _ and _ 4_. in this case an extra terms appear when the path crosses the singularities , fig.[path ] , lower drawing",
    ".    in general case we may write @xmath129 \\ , \\theta(-\\xi )   \\theta \\left ( \\xi+\\txt{{1 \\over 2}\\sqrt{4m^2-t } } \\right ) \\delta(p''^2-m^2 ) \\ ,",

    "it can be verified that during the integration according to ( [ int1 ] ) @xmath42 and @xmath43 are always negative .",
    "for the first integral in the r.h.s .",
    "@xmath131 and thus @xmath132 .",
    "as we will see later , the same is true for other integrals .",
    "this is a great advantage , since the ffs are well - known for @xmath30 ( which corresponds to the elastic scattering ) , and much worse known for @xmath34 .    here",
    "we will change variables to make new independent variables ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath111 ) instead of ( @xmath37 , @xmath133 , @xmath111 ) .",
    "it is important to take into account that @xmath134 ; for this purpose we insert @xmath135 under the integral .",
    "this implies the condition : @xmath136 , and the integration path along the imaginary axis becomes bounded .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath137 note that at @xmath138 one has @xmath139 .    in new variables we have @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "therefore when @xmath144 is expressed through @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath111 , it has , as a function of @xmath111 , just one pole and one branch cut .",
    "it is worth noting that ( [ kphinew ] ) may differ in sign from @xmath109 defined according to ( [ kphi ] ) .",
