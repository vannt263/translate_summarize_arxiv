    "there has been considerable interest in the flavor dependence of the proton s quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "the first measurement of the @xmath4 asymmetry was made by the nmc group @xcite .",
    "the integral of this distribution showed a violation of the gottfried sum rule .",
    "later , drell - yan @xcite and deep inelastic scattering @xcite experiments determined the bjorken-@xmath5 dependence of the asymmetry .",
    "the meson cloud model and the sullivan process were used to explain the momentum fraction distribution of @xmath4 ; many other models have been proposed .",
    "most recently , zhang and collaborators @xcite have used a simple statistical model to calculate the @xmath4 distribution in the proton .",
    "they consider the proton to be an ensemble of quark - gluon fock states , and use detailed balance @xcite or  the principle of balance \" @xcite to determine the distribution functions for all partons of the proton . despite its simplicity",
    ", the model does reasonably well in predicting the distributions of partons , as well as for that of @xmath4 .",
    "the excess of @xmath6 over @xmath7 comes about from the 2:1 ratio of u : d , which provides an excess of @xmath8 quarks for the annihilation of @xmath7 s .",
    "zhang , zou , and yang ( zzy ) @xcite write a general fock state expansion for the proton as    @xmath9    with @xmath10 the number of @xmath11 pairs , @xmath12 the number of @xmath13 pairs and @xmath14 the number of gluons .",
    "the states are normalized such that the sum of the probabilities @xmath15 of finding a proton in the state @xmath16 summed over all @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 is unity @xcite ,    @xmath17    in zzy s statistical model , detailed balance between any two fock states requires that    @xmath18    in which @xmath19 is the transfer rate of state @xmath20 into state @xmath21 .",
    "transfer rates between states are assumed to be proportional to the number of partons that can split or recombine .",
    "taking into account two processes , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , zzy find that    @xmath24    this equation , together with the normalization condition ( [ norm ] ) , determines all the @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear from this equation that @xmath26 states , labelled by @xmath10 , are suppressed relative to @xmath27 states , labelled by @xmath12 .",
    "summing over all states , zhang et al .",
    "@xcite find @xmath28 , remarkably close to the experimental value of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "zzy determined parton distribution functions for the proton by using a monte carlo simulation of the distribution of momenta among the @xmath30 partons in each fock state .",
    "the phase space volume @xmath31 for @xmath30 free partons is determined by @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the 4-momenta of the proton and the @xmath10-th parton , respectively .",
    "the masses of the partons are neglected so that @xmath35 , and @xmath36 zzy argue that this free parton phase space distribution should be multiplied by @xmath37 because partons with smaller momenta spend more time at the center of the proton where they are almost free ; these partons are thus weighted with a higher probability .",
    "then @xmath38 , the distribution for confined partons , is :    @xmath39    we have found that the effect of the weighting factor is quite small , except for the very lowest and highest parton momenta .    from the monte carlo distribution of parton momenta @xmath40 , the parton distributions can be found in terms of the light cone variable bjorken @xmath5 ,    @xmath41    in which @xmath42 is the proton mass .",
    "we used rambo @xcite for our monte carlo event generator .",
    "then for an @xmath30-parton state , for which @xmath43 , the @xmath5-distributions for @xmath7 and @xmath6 are    @xmath44    for @xmath8 and @xmath45 are @xmath46 and for the gluons is @xmath47 thus , we find , in accord with zzy , @xmath48 and corresponding equations for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , normalized so that @xmath53 dx = 1 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the average number of partons in the proton , @xmath54 , is given by @xmath55 dx \\approx 5.6\\ ; .\\ ] ] this sets the scale @xmath56 gev for @xmath57 at which the distributions are calculated .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "1 , which reproduces zzy s results , shows that the experimentally deduced ( @xmath58 ) is fit qualitatively in this model , but is low at small @xmath5 and high at large @xmath5 .",
    "the discrepancy with experiment shows up more starkly in fig .",
    "2 , our plot of @xmath59 .",
    "we find that these results are changed very little if the phase space weighting factors @xmath60 are varied from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that it is remarkable that such a simple model does so well .    .",
    "]    there are , of course , other explanations of the excess of @xmath6 over @xmath7 , which have been considered previously , particularly the pion cloud @xcite and @xmath63 mesons @xcite .",
    "the leading term in the fock state expansion of the pion cloud model is a  bare \" proton which consists of valence quarks plus @xmath64 pairs due to gluon splitting .",
    "it can be argued that this gluon splitting is what is being considered by zzy and thus the perturbative sea in the  bare \" proton should not be symmetric , i.e. @xmath65 . the pion cloud , represented by the higher - order terms in the expansion , would then be an additional effect . if this is the case , the pions must have a larger role at high @xmath5 where the fall - off of the ratio @xmath66 is not reproduced by the statistical model .",
    "we will not pursue this argument further here .",
    "if the statistical model has some validity , then it should not only work for the proton , but also for the pion .",
    "this distribution function is , in fact , required in the pion cloud model .",
    "we have therefore investigated the valence and sea quark distributions for the @xmath67 in the statistical model .",
    "the formulas are similar to those for the proton , but because there is only one valence quark of each flavor in the @xmath67 , the sea is flavor symmetric .",
    "we write the fock state expansion for the pion as    @xmath68    the analysis of section 1 is unchanged , except that @xmath69 , and the ratio of probabilities for different fock states ( [ ratio ] ) is now    @xmath70    so that the @xmath67 sea is symmetric , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "we find @xmath72 in the pion .",
    "the quark distributions for a specific @xmath30-parton state are @xmath73 @xmath74 and for the gluons is @xmath47 the parton distributions are found by summing these distribution functions over all values of @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 the valence quark distribution function is @xmath79     and @xmath80 for the pion . solid curve : valence quark distribution ; long - dashed curve : sea quark distribution ; short - dashed curve : gluon distribution . ]",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "3 . the valence quark distributions are too high for large @xmath5 because of the dominant contribution of the @xmath81 , @xmath82 state , the leading term in the fock expansion , for which @xmath83 is a uniform distribution in @xmath5 .",
    "the sea quark distribution is flavor symmetric , as noted above .     in the pion ,",
    "compared to the experimental results of conway et al .",
    "the dashed curve shows our results without any evolution , as in fig .",
    "3 , which correspond to a scale of @xmath84 gev@xmath85 . the solid curve shows our results evolved to @xmath86 gev@xmath85 of the e615 experiment . ]    in order to compare our valence quark distributions to experiment , we carried out an evolution in @xmath87 .",
    "we determined the starting scale of our distributions by requiring that the first and second moments of our valence quark distribution at @xmath88 gev@xmath85 be equal to those found by sutton et al .",
    "@xcite . this gave us a starting scale of @xmath84 gev@xmath85 .",
    "we used miyama and kumano s code bf1 @xcite for the dglap @xcite evolution .",
    "we compare our pion valence quark distribution with that obtained by e615 from pion scattering on tungsten @xcite in fig .",
    "4 . the dashed curve shows our results without any evolution , as in fig .",
    "3 . the solid curve shows our results evolved to @xmath86 gev@xmath85 of the e615 experiment .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is good .     in the pion , compared to the calculation of hecht , roberts and smith @xcite ( dashed curve ) and the experimental results of conway et al",
    "both calculations were evolved to @xmath86 gev@xmath85 of the e615 experiment . ]    other theoretical calculations of pion parton distribution functions have used constituent quark models , the nambu - jona - lasinio model , instantons , or the dyson schwinger equations .",
    "moments of the distributions can be calculated in lattice qcd , from which particular forms of the distributions can be reconstructed . for references",
    "see the recent papers of hecht , roberts and schmidt @xcite and detmold , melnitchouk and thomas @xcite . in fig .",
    "5 we compare our valence quark distribution to the dyson - schwinger calculation of hecht et al . and to experiment .",
    "both distributions were evolved to @xmath86 gev@xmath85 .",
    "we find it remarkable that our simple statistical model agrees with experiment as well as the covariant , qcd - based model .",
    "the calculation of parton distribution functions is an important goal of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "we have used the statistical model of zhang et al . , developed for the calculation of parton distribution functions in the proton , to calculate the parton distribution functions of the pion .",
