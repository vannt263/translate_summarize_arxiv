    "lately , there has been considerable interest in low - dimensional spin systems that exhibit frustration @xcite .",
    "a very interesting class of such systems is chain compounds consisting of edge - sharing @xmath0 units .",
    "recently , a variety of these copper oxides were synthesized and found to show unique physical properties @xcite .",
    "the frustration in these compounds arises from the competition of exchange interactions between magnetic @xmath1 ions carrying spins @xmath2 . due to a specific geometry of these systems ( @xmath3 angle is close to @xmath4 ) the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction is ferromagnetic , while the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) one is antiferromagnetic and absolute values of these interactions are comparable @xcite .",
    "an appropriate model describing the magnetic properties of such copper oxides is so - called f - af spin chain model the hamiltonian of which has a form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this model is characterized by a frustration parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the quantum f - af @xmath9 model has been intensively studied last years @xcite .",
    "most of studies of this model are related to the isotropic case ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is known that the ground state of the isotropic model is ferromagnetic for @xmath11 . at @xmath12",
    "the phase transition to the incommensurate singlet phase with spiral spin correlations takes place .",
    "remarkably , this transition point does not depend on spin value @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "it was shown also that the f - af @xmath9 model with anisotropic interactions has a rich phase diagram @xcite . in our papers",
    "@xcite we investigated weakly anisotropic ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) quantum spin-1/2 model ( [ h ] ) .",
    "it was shown that even small anisotropy essentially effects on the properties of the model .",
    "in particular , the transition point from the ferromagnetic to the spiral - like ground state shifts from @xmath12 .",
    "an interesting feature of the quantum anisotropic model ( [ h ] ) is the existence of the multimagnon bound complexes in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "these complexes govern the low - temperature thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "it was noted also that the nnn interaction strongly affects the excitation spectrum especially in the vicinity of the transition point @xmath12 .",
    "it is known that there is a close relation between the multimagnon bound complexes in the quantum spin models and soliton and kink excitations in the classical counterparts . in particular , these soliton states have been studied extensively for the classical easy - axis ferromagnetic chain and a connection between them and the bound magnon complexes in the quantum @xmath9 model ( [ h ] ) at @xmath17 was discussed @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of the frustration on the solitons has not been considered before .",
    "the f - af model represents a suitable model to study this problem and to investigate the connection between the quantum excitation spectrum and the soliton solutions of the classical frustrated spin model .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the ground state phase diagram of the quantum model ( [ h ] ) with both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are qualitatively similar to that for the model with the anisotropy of the nn interaction only .",

    "takes the form @xmath21 where we put @xmath22 as an energy unit and added constant shifts to secure the energy of the ferromagnetic state to be zero .",
    "the phase diagram of the classical f - af model with @xmath23 consists of the ferromagnetic and the spiral phases .",
    "the ferromagnetic ground state is simple , i.e. , it has all spins parallel to the z axis . however , the soliton excitations in this phase are not trivial especially near the transition point between the phases .",
    "our main goal is to study the behavior of the solitons in the vicinity of the isotropic transition ( it ) point ( @xmath24 , @xmath12 ) and to compare it with the properties of the excitations of the quantum model .",
    "as it will be shown the frustration effects strongly modify the soliton states especially for small anisotropy .",
    "in particular , the exponent characterizing the power dependence of the gap ( the soliton energy with respect to the ground state ) on the anisotropy is different from that for @xmath25 .",

    "we deduce the corresponding energy functional and establish the scaling form of the soliton energy as a function of the anisotropy and the frustration parameter . in this section",
    "we also obtain asymptotes of the soliton solutions at large distances and determine the necessary conditions of the soliton stability . in sec.iv",
    "we present results of the numerical minimization of the energy functional which confirm the scaling estimations . in sec.v",

    "we show that the behavior of both classic solitons and @xmath26-magnon quantum spin excitations are functionally similar to @xmath26-boson bound complexes of the bose model with the attractive interaction if @xmath26 is not large . in sec.vii",

    "@xmath40 is the energy as a functional of the vector field @xmath34 . using the continuum approximation ( [ dsdx ] ) , hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) goes over into the well - known energy functional : @xmath41 \\label{exxz}\\ ] ]    classical equation of motion ( [ ll ] ) for model ( [ exxz ] ) has two constants of the motion : the magnetization ( continuum analog to a number of magnons ) @xmath42 where we subtract a constant to make @xmath43 finite for solitons , and the momentum @xmath44    the ground state of ( [ exxz ] ) is the ferromagnetic configuration with all spins parallel ( or antiparallel ) to the z axis , i.e. @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",

    ", the energy for a given values of @xmath43 and @xmath50 is @xmath51    remarkably , eq.([emp ] ) reproduces the exact result for the energy at @xmath52 of the @xmath43-magnon bound state @xcite for the most quantum case @xmath9 .    here",
    "we will show that simple scaling arguments are able to establish the correct scaling dependence for the energy .",
    "for this aim we rescale the coordinate @xmath53 and introduce the normalized spin vector field @xmath54 in eq.([exxz ] ) , which results in @xmath55 \\label{eee}\\ ] ]    we notice that the integrand in equation ( [ eee ] ) does not depend on any parameters and is expressed through the normalized spin vector field .",
    "this means that the energy scales as @xmath56 , which is correct for a kink or for a large soliton excitations ( see eq.([emp ] ) ) .",
    "however , we can make one more step .",
    "the same procedure for magnetization ( [ m ] ) gives @xmath57    this expression means that the magnetization forms a scaling parameter @xmath58 . in a similar manner one can find that momentum ( [ p ] ) produces a dimensionless parameter @xmath59 independent of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the energy of a soliton of the size @xmath43 having a momentum @xmath50 can be written in a form : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a scaling function , which can not be found in the framework of this scaling estimate .",
    "fortunately , for model ( [ exxz ] ) this function is known exactly ( [ emp ] ) , which validates the above scaling arguments .",
    "thus , simple scaling estimates allowed us to establish the scaling parameters and the scaling form for the soliton energy .",
    "there is one more important fact which is worth noting here .",
    "the exact static solution for a kink in the discrete xxz model with classical spins has been constructed by gochev in ref.@xcite .",
    "he found that the kink energy has a form @xmath63 which reproduces the exact result for the case @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this allows us to assume that the energy of kink ( or large soliton , which has double energy of kink ) for xxz chain with any value of @xmath13 has an universal dependence on @xmath64 ( [ ekink ] ) .",
    "we will see that this universality is destroyed in case @xmath65 .",
    "the nnn term in model ( [ hh ] ) causes the frustration in the system and immediately destroys the integrability of the model .",
    "however , the behavior of the system for @xmath66 and weak easy - axis anisotropy remains very similar to the case @xmath25 . in the classical and continuum approximation",
    "the hamiltonian reduces to an energy functional ( [ exxz ] ) with renormalized factor @xmath67 at @xmath68 . in particular",
    ", this means that the found scaling form for the soliton energy ( [ escxxz ] ) remains valid .",
    "the situation drastically changes near the it point ( @xmath69 ) where the ground state phase transition in the isotropic case takes place .",
    "let us deduce the energy functional describing the vicinity of this point .",
    "the continuum approximation assumes that the differences @xmath70 and @xmath71 are small and eq.([edis ] ) can be expanded in these differences . however , in the vicinity of the it point it is more clear and instructive to derive the continuum approach in terms of a spin vector field . for this aim",
    "we rewrite hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) in the form : @xmath72 where the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 are small in the vicinity of the it point .    in the classical and the continuum approach the expression containing spin operators in the first term in eq.([h14 ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath75 and that in the second term in eq.([h14 ] ) according to eq.([dsdx ] ) .",
    "thus , hamiltonian ( [ h14 ] ) is mapped to the energy functional @xmath76   \\label{etr}\\ ] ]    the effect of the fourth - order term @xmath77 in the energy functional like ( [ etr ] ) was studied before @xcite , but it was considered as a small correction to the main contribution given by the term @xmath78 . on the contrary for our model ( [ etr ] ) near",
    "the it point the fourth - order term @xmath77 becomes the leading one .",
    "the appearance of the fourth - order term is related to the fact that the one - magnon spectrum in the it point becomes @xmath79 .",
    "the energy functional ( [ etr ] ) in terms of the angular variables @xmath80 and @xmath81 has a rather cumbersome form : @xmath82 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{s^{2}}{8}\\int \\mathrm{d}x\\left [ ( 4 - 2\\sin ^{2}\\theta ) \\varphi ^{\\prime 2}\\theta ^{\\prime 2}+(2\\varphi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime } \\theta ^{\\prime } -\\varphi ^{\\prime 2}\\theta ^{\\prime \\prime } ) \\sin ( 2\\theta ) \\right ]   \\label{elong}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the space derivatives @xmath83 .",
    "one can check that eq.([elong ] ) represents the leading terms in the expansion of eq.([edis ] ) in small differences @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which is actually assumed in the continuum approximation .    at first , let us study the phase diagram of the classical continuum model ( [ elong ] ) .",
    "numerical calculations ( details will be given below ) confirmed a natural assumption that the ground state spin configuration for the easy - axis anisotropy case ( @xmath84 ) corresponds to the choice @xmath85 .",
    "in this case the energy functional ( [ elong ] ) simplifies to @xmath86    variation of the energy functional ( [ etheta ] ) in @xmath81 leads to the euler equation @xmath87    the ground state in the ferromagnetic phase has a trivial solution @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) with zero energy . in the isotropic case ( @xmath88 )",
    "the transition from the ferromagnetic to the spiral phase takes place at @xmath12 . for @xmath89 the solution @xmath81 has a pure spiral form @xmath90 which evidently has zero mean spin projection on any axis @xmath91 and describes the spiral in the xz plane .    in the anisotropic case",
    "the spiral function ( [ sp ] ) does not satisfy eq.([eiler ] ) .",
    "however , it represents a good approximation for the solution in the spiral phase . using this function as a variational one for the energy functional ( [ etheta ] )",
    "we find that the transition between the ferromagnetic and the spiral phases occurs on the line @xmath92 .",
    "assuming that the correction to the spiral solution @xmath93 is small , we found from eq.([eiler ] ) that the first correction has the oscillating form : @xmath94    this function is not a pure spiral : due to the oscillating correction the spin vectors prefer to direct along the z axis , so that @xmath95 .",
    "however the mean values of all total projections remain zero : @xmath96 .",
    "the calculation of the energy functional ( [ etheta ] ) with the function ( [ spiral ] ) yields @xmath97    one can see that the correction to the energy is really small in the spiral phase region .",
    "energy ( [ espiral ] ) becomes negative for @xmath98 .",
    "this means that taking the correction in eq.([spiral ] ) into account shifts the transition line from the ferromagnetic to the spiral phase on the value less than @xmath99 ( the smallness of the correction in eq.([spiral ] ) allows us to leave the name spiral for this phase ) .",
    "the phase transition from the ferromagnetic to the spiral phase at @xmath100 is obviously the first order one .",
    "the transition line @xmath101 is shown in fig.[phase ] .",
    "it is worth noting here that the found behavior of the transition line corresponds to the classical version of spin model ( [ hh ] ) and it is shifted for the quantum spin-@xmath13 model .",
    "quantum corrections for @xmath102 change numerical coefficient in eq.([espiral ] ) .",
    "but for the @xmath9 case they lead to another form of the transition line : @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "now let us study the excitations of model ( [ etr ] ) .",
    "similar to the case @xmath25 the lowest configuration in the ferromagnetic region for a given @xmath104 is described by the static soliton - like solutions of eq.([eiler ] ) with @xmath85 over the ferromagnetic configuration @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we could not find the exact soliton solution near the it point .",
    "however , it is possible to determine the scaling dependence of the energy of soliton of size @xmath43 on parameters @xmath60 and @xmath105 using scaling estimates as we did for the case @xmath25 .",
    "near the it point we perform the rescaling @xmath106 and @xmath107 which transforms the energy functional ( [ etr ] ) to @xmath108   \\label{etrscal}\\ ] ] with @xmath109 .",
    "since the integrand in eq.([etrscal ] ) depends on the parameter @xmath110 only , we conclude that the energy of a kink or of a large soliton is @xmath111 .",
    "as a result of rescaling the magnetization ( [ m ] ) becomes : @xmath112",
    "so , the magnetization produces a scaling parameter @xmath113 .",
    "the momentum ( [ p ] ) forms the same parameter @xmath114 as for the case @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the energy of a soliton of the size @xmath43 can be represented in a form : @xmath115 where the scaling function @xmath62 can be found numerically .",
    "this scaling form is exactly the same as was found for the quantum spin-@xmath2 model near the it point @xcite .",
    "we note that similar scaling procedure for the @xmath116-dimensional version of model ( [ etr ] ) gives the scaling form for the energy of the soliton of the size @xmath43 ( even small - amplitude solitons are stable for model ( [ etr ] ) in two- and three - dimensional cases @xcite ) : @xmath117 and the case @xmath118 requires special treatment .    though the exact solution of the corresponding equation of motion ( [ ll ] ) is unknown it is possible to identify the necessary conditions for a stability of solitons and establish their asymptotic behavior .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the complex function @xmath119 so that @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "equation of motion ( [ ll ] ) for @xmath122 near the it point reads @xmath123 where @xmath124 is rescaled time .",
    "solitons are localized objects and , therefore , it requires that @xmath125 far from the soliton center .",
    "so , at large distance from the center one can linearize eq.([llpsi ] ) in @xmath126 by putting @xmath127 : @xmath128    we seek the asymptotic of @xmath126 in conventional exponential form @xmath129 \\label{psiasymp}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are normalized linear and angular velocities defined as @xmath132    substituting eq.([psiasymp ] ) into eq.([psilinear ] ) we obtain equation for @xmath133 @xmath134    this equation has four roots .",
    "the condition of the soliton existence is that all roots have non - zero real part , which secures the decay of solutions at @xmath135 .",

    "allowable values of @xmath130 and @xmath131 lie below the boundaries.,width=288 ]    equations ( [ stable ] ) of the boundary of the soliton existence region coincide with the condition of the spin - wave instability .",
    "the existence regions for a few values of the parameter @xmath110 are shown in fig.[vomega ] . for @xmath143",
    "the region has a form similar to the case @xmath25 with the quadratic dependence @xmath138 near the maximum point ( @xmath146 ) . for the case",
    "@xmath147 this dependence becomes @xmath148 .",
    "when @xmath145 , the dependence @xmath138 shifts down and a cusp appears at the maximal point ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the region of the soliton existence contains allowable values of @xmath130 and @xmath131 for a given @xmath110 . as it can be seen in fig.[vomega ] the soliton can exist in the spiral phase ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "but , for example , the kink is unstable for @xmath151 since the point ( @xmath152 ) corresponding to the kink does not belong to the existence region .",
    "it is worth noting that one should be careful in treating of the part of the existence region with large negative @xmath131 , where the derivatives of @xmath81 and @xmath80 near the center of soliton become large and the continuum approximations eqs.([dsdx ] ) , ( [ dsdx2 ] ) become doubtful .    within the existence region",
    "the roots of eq.([eqkappa ] ) have the forms @xmath153 where @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are real nonnegative quantities and @xmath157 .",

    ", therefore , analyze the roots @xmath160 and @xmath161 . at infinity only the root @xmath162 with the smaller real part is vital .",

    "fortunately , for the static soliton the solution of eq.([eqkappa ] ) can be obtained explicitly and this allows to analyze in detail the behavior of the soliton asymptotes for given values of @xmath110 and @xmath131 .",

    "finally , for @xmath176 the parameter @xmath162 is pure imaginary , which implies that the solution oscillates but does not decay at infinity .",

    "as was noted above only one asymptotic with @xmath162 having smaller real part survives at infinity for @xmath177 .",
    "this implies that the asymptotic of the function @xmath172 has no zeros .",

    "the boundaries between the regions corresponding to different asymptotic regimes for large solitons are obtained from the above analysis and they are shown in fig.[phase ] .",
    "as one can see in fig.[phase ] the oscillating large solitons exist not only in the ferromagnetic phase but , partly , in the spiral phase region @xmath185 .",
    "the amplitude of the soliton oscillations grow as @xmath110 increases and the oscillations are most strong in the spiral phase",
    ". however , one should remember that the soliton excitations in the spiral phase lie in the high - energy part of the spectrum , because the energy of the soliton - like solutions differs from the ferromagnetic one on some finite value ( [ escal ] ) .",
    "therefore , the soliton energy is higher than the spiral one ( [ espiral ] ) on the value proportional to the system size",
    ". nevertheless , these states can be important in strong magnetic field close to the saturation value .",
    "if we expand @xmath186 and take into account the terms @xmath187 in eq.([llpsi ] ) , then eq.([llpsi ] ) near the border of the soliton existence reduces to the modified non - linear schrdinger equation containing the fourth - order derivative term @xmath188    unfortunately , in spite of substantial simplification of the initial equation of motion ( [ llpsi ] ) , the exact solution of this equation is unknown and we have to use numerical calculation .",

    "they correctly reproduce the known asymptotic for @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "we have carried out a numerical analysis of the discrete and the continuum versions of the classical spin model ( [ hh ] ) in the vicinity of the it point .",

    "the periodic boundary conditions for soliton and the open boundary conditions for kink excitations were imposed .",
    "the numerical calculations showed that for small @xmath60 the difference between the discrete and the continuum models is negligible as expected and it increases as @xmath60 grows . on the investigation of the dynamics of solitons",
    "we restrict ourself to small anisotropy @xmath52 , when the continuum approximation is valid , because in the discrete model with finite @xmath60 a so - called pinning potential appears @xcite and the momentum becomes undefined .",
    "so , on default we will present numerical results for the discrete classical model ( [ edis ] ) , keeping in mind that the continuum approach corresponds to the limit @xmath194 .",

    "we found that in a weakly anisotropic limit ( @xmath402 ) the behavior of the soliton solutions for small frustration parameter @xmath11 is qualitatively similar to that for the exactly solvable easy - axis xxz chain ( @xmath25 case ) .",
    "however , the situation drastically changes near the it point ( @xmath88 , @xmath12 ) , where the transition from the ferromagnetic to the spiral ground state takes place in the isotropic case . in the vicinity of",
    "the it point the corresponding energy functional in the continuum approximation qualitatively changes and does not admit the exact solution .",
    "the analysis of the derived energy functional allowed us to estimate the behavior of the transition line between the ferromagnetic to the spiral ground state in ( @xmath403 ) plane near the it point .",
    "we mainly interested in the behavior of the solitons in the vicinity of the it point .",
    "we showed that these localized states are separated from the ferromagnetic state by a finite gap .",
    "the dependence of the soliton energy ( the gap ) on model parameters near the it point was established on a base of the scaling arguments . as a result we found that the soliton energy is proportional to @xmath404 and is expressed by the scaling function ( [ escal ] ) depending on three scaling parameters :",
    "@xmath405 , the scaled soliton size @xmath180 and the momentum @xmath197 .",
    "the analysis of the asymptotic solutions of the corresponding equation of motion provided us with the necessary conditions of the soliton stability .",
    "it was shown that solitons of all sizes and any momentum exist when @xmath234 , while in the region @xmath145 there are definite restrictions on the soliton size @xmath180 and the momentum @xmath197 .",
    "the distribution of the allowable values of the soliton parameters in ( @xmath179 ) plane for @xmath145 has very complicated form , which can be determined numerically only .",
    "for example , the static solitons ( @xmath199 ) only of the middle size @xmath243 are stable at @xmath242 .",
    "nevertheless , some facts about the soliton existence region was ascertained analytically and then confirmed by numerical calculations . in particular ,",
    "small static ( @xmath199 ) solitons are unstable for @xmath145 , while small solitons with non - zero momentum exist for any @xmath110 .",
    "large solitons ( @xmath181 ) exist for @xmath246 and , therefore , they survive in the part of the spiral phase @xmath406 . though the soliton excitations in the spiral phase lie in the high - energy part of the spectrum , they can play an essential role in the magnetization processes .    in the isotropic limit ( @xmath249 ) only small solitons with non - zero momentum survive and the maximal allowable size of these solitons increases when the frustration parameter tends to the critical value @xmath407 .",
    "such a dependence of the soliton size on the frustration parameter is qualitatively similar to the observation that the size of the multimagnon bound complexes with @xmath254 in the quantum f - af model grows when @xmath407 .",
    "we found that the frustration reveals itself in the oscillating shape of solitons .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations grows at approaching to the spiral phase and further inside of it .",
    "generally , at some value of @xmath110 the solution starts to oscillate without the decay at infinity , i.e. , soliton - like solution with given values of @xmath180 and @xmath197 disappears .",
    "we studied the finite - size effects on the soliton solutions .",
    "it was shown that the soliton solution on finite ring originates in the uniform ( non - localized ) state .",
    "the transition from the uniform to the soliton - like state occurs at the critical value of the anisotropy @xmath408 , below which the uniform solution is realized .",
    "this finite - size effect is similar to the well - known gross - pitaevskii transition in the bose - systems .    in order to establish a connection between the properties of the solitons and the multi - magnon complexes of the quantum counterpart of this model we used the dyson - maleev mapping of the spin model to the bose one .",
    "it turned out that the dependence of the energy of boson bound complexes on model parameters represents a particular case of the found scaling expression for the classical soliton energy .",
    "moreover , the energy of the bound magnon complexes for quantum spin-@xmath2 model found by us before perfectly coincides with the scaling equation for soliton energy .",
    "therefore , we believe that the bound energy of multi - magnon complex for a quantum spin-@xmath13 model near the it point is characterized by the same critical exponents and by the identical scaling parameters as the soliton energy , though the corresponding scaling functions are different for different @xmath13 .",
    "it is known that such a resemblance takes place for the heisenberg ferromagnetic chain with an easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "our study shows that the multi - magnon complexes behave substantially as the classical objects for the frustrated model as well .    for future it would be interesting to study the behavior of the classical spin model deeply in the spiral phase .",
    "we believe that it can help in understanding of unusual magnetization processes and shed light on the behavior of the multi - magnon complexes at high magnetic fields .",
