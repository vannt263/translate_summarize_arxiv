    "the task of building a quantum computer , allowing for massive quantum parallelism @xcite , long - lived quantum state superposition and entanglement , is one of the big challenge of twenty - first century physics .",
    "it requires precise maintenance and manipulation of quantum systems at a level far from anything that has ever been done before .",
    "many criteria , nicely summarized by the divincenzo criteria @xcite , need to be satisfied in order to be able to harness the power of quantum physics to extract powerful information processing , and while most of these criteria have been satisfied to a reasonable level by some prospect for the implementation of a quantum information processing device @xcite , no such prospect has yet been able to fulfill to a sufficient level all of these criteria at once . in particular , one criterion",
    "that not many prospects seem to be able to fulfill is that of scalability , the ability of the model to remain coherent for quantum systems with a large number of qubits .",
    "solid - state quantum registers seem to emerge as a medium that would allow for such scalability , while still being able to satisfy the other criteria @xcite .",
    "however , as for any physical implementation of quantum computing , it suffers from noise , dissipation processes mainly in the form of decoherence and relaxation @xcite . to be able to use the power of quantum computation",
    ", we must be able to eliminate this noise and maintain quantum information throughout the processing .",
    "a general framework for doing so is quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that by encoding a single logical qubit on sufficiently many physical qubits , we can correct arbitrary errors on a single physical qubit @xcite .",
    "but what happens with more realistic multi - qubit errors ?    in order to perform a quantum error correction ,",
    "additional qubits are needed .",
    "however , these additional qubits can lead to a much higher rate of decoherence ( even superdecoherence ) @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the three - qubit repetition code has already been simulated for a cavity - qed setup @xcite , showing a significant but limited improvement for the preservation of quantum information . here , we consider a realistic noise model for @xmath0 charge qubit quantum registers @xcite , and simulate this noise model on encoded qubits to evaluate the efficiency of a qec scheme .",
    "the quantum error correcting code ( qecc ) used is the 5 qubit divincenzo - shor code @xcite .",
    "we structure this work as follows : we first describe the representation for quantum systems we will be using , as well as that for the noise model .",
    "we then further analyze the physical model we study , and review the qecc we implement within this model .",
    "section [ sec : sim ] then contains the core of this work , that is , a description of the algorithm used for the simulation , followed by a discussion of the results obtained .",
    "we will be considering the basic unit of quantum information : the qubit .",
    "a qubit can be implemented by any two level quantum system , and so can be represented by a unit length vector in a two - dimensional complex hilbert space , up to an equivalence relation for global phase .",
    "if we consider some prefered orthonormal basis states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , a single qubit can be parametrized by 2 parameters @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 : @xmath5 this is the bloch sphere representation , for pure qubit systems .",
    "when considering multiple interacting qubit systems , the overall system is described by the tensor product of the component hilbert spaces . in general , once two systems have interacted , a complete description of the whole system can not be obtained by a description of each subsystem : this is entanglement .",
    "much of the power of quantum information processing comes from entanglement , it is a uniquely quantum resource .",
    "note that this is also related to the difficulty of simulating a multi qubit quantum system : as a @xmath0 qubit quantum system can not be completely described by each of the @xmath0 two dimensional subsystems , it must be described by a @xmath6 dimensional system , so that the memory required to store the information about a @xmath0 qubit quantum system scales exponentially with @xmath0 , and so do the time required to simulate operations on this system .",
    "this also raises the question of the description of subsystems of entangled systems .",
    "it turns out that the density operator formalism @xcite can solve this issue . in this formalism , a state @xmath7 is represented by a density matrix @xmath8 instead of by a state vector @xmath9 . then",
    ", if we are only interested in subsequent evolution of a particular subsystem of the state @xmath7 , we can do a partial trace @xcite over the other irrelevant subsytems and only evolve the reduced density matrix of the subsystem of interest . in this way",
    ", we obtain the right outcome statistic on this subsystem while not having to evolve a high - dimensionality state as required to describe the whole system completely .",
    "this density operator formalism also comes in handy for the description of statistical ensembles @xmath10 , where the system is prepared in the state @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding density operator is @xmath13 , and here also the evolution of this state leads to the right measurement statistics .",
    "a closely related subject is that of quantum noise . as a quantum system",
    "can not ever be completely isolated from its environment , they interact and then become entangled .",
    "so , even though the global system - environment pair undergoes unitary evolution , the main system does not , and this generates quantum noise .",
    "this is well described by the quantum operation formalism @xcite .",
    "two types of noise in which we will be mostly interested will be decoherence and relaxation , and we will see that these are closely related to generalized dephasing channels @xcite and amplitude damping channels respectively @xcite .    since the quantum system of interest will be subject to noise , we want a way to quantitatively describe how close it will remain to the initial quantum information we wished to preserve .",
    "a good measure of this is the fidelity @xcite , and for a pure input state @xmath9 evolving to a mixed state @xmath14 , the fidelity is given by @xmath15",
    "the two main types of noise in which we will be interested are decoherence , which correspond to a loss of quantum coherence without loss of energy , and relaxation , which correspond to a loss of energy .",
    "we will see that these types of noise are closely related to well - studied channels : generalized dephasing channels @xcite and amplitude damping channels @xcite      generalized dephasing channels correspond to physical processes in which there is loss of quantum coherence without loss of energy .",
    "that is , there exist a preferred basis , called the dephasing basis , such that pure states in that basis are transmitted without error , but pure superposition get mixed , and quantum information is lost to the environment .",
    "if we let @xmath16 be the input system with orthonormal basis @xmath17 , @xmath18 be the output system with orthonormal basis @xmath19 , and @xmath20 be the environment with normalized , not necessarily orthogonal states @xmath21 , then an isometric map from the input system to the output - environment system is given by @xmath22 then , starting with an input state @xmath23 , we get the output state @xmath24 by first applying the isometry @xmath25 , then tracing over @xmath20 : @xmath26 as we can see , in this representation , the output corresponds to the hadamard product between the @xmath27 input matrix and the @xmath28 decoherence matrix .",
    "also , since the @xmath29 are normalized , @xmath30 , the diagonal terms are left unchanged : @xmath31 these diagonal terms correspond to the probability of measuring the quantum state in the corresponding dephasing basis state , while the off - diagonal terms are coherence ( phase ) terms . for these off - diagonal terms ,",
    "the cauchy - schwarz inequality ( @xmath32 ) tells us that the output terms must be smaller than or equal to the input terms : @xmath33 . in the special case",
    "where the @xmath21 are also orthogonal , we obtain a completely dephasing channel , which kills all off - diagonal terms , @xmath34 if @xmath35 . for a subsequent measurement in the dephasing basis ,",
    "this yields a classical statistical output with no quantum coherence terms : @xmath36 .",
    "amplitude damping channels correspond to physical processes in which there is a loss of energy from the quantum system of interest to the environment .",
    "that is , there is a probability that a quantum state passes from a higher energy excited state to a lower energy state .",
    "for the two - dimensional quantum systems in which we are mostly interested , this corresponds to a probability of passing from the excited state to the ground state , while the ground state is left unaffected . in the quantum operation formalism , this channel has operation elements @xmath37 : @xmath38 where the matrix representation is given in the energy eigenbasis , and the parameter @xmath39 corresponds to the probability of decay .",
    "then , for some input state @xmath23 , we get an output state @xmath24 : @xmath40 if we represent the action of the channel as @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 , we can extend this definition to multi - qubit systems . making the assumption that energy lost for each two - dimensional subsystem is independent , a tensor product of this channel , @xmath43 , corresponds to a loss of energy in each subsystem independently .",
    "solid state quantum systems represent an interesting prospect for the physical implementation of scalable quantum devices @xcite .",
    "a lot of research goes into implementation of superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "another important avenue of research are quantum dots , in which two level quantum systems can be implemented in either the spin or position degree of freedom of the electron trapped in the dots .",
    "while spin quantum dots have a longer decoherence time @xcite , spins are also more difficult to manipulate . in charge quantum dots , where the basis states correspond to the position of the electron in either of two adjacent quantum dots , the coupling is strong and hence fast manipulation is possible , but this also leads to shorter decoherence times .",
    "we will consider such a system , which offers an interesting playground for current technology research @xcite .",
    "moreover , the decoherence for @xmath0 qubit quantum registers , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : qubit ] , has already been computed by ischii et al .",
    "@xcite , and it is this model which is used in this simulation .",
    "it is found that for these charge quantum dots , the decoherence of the quantum system can be represented as a generalized dephasing channel in the canonical basis of the charge qubits , corresponding to the position eigenstates . indeed ,",
    "pure states in that basis are perfectly transmitted , while pure superpositions become noisy .",
    "it is then possible to compute the evolution of the quantum register by taking the hadamard product of the input density matrix with a decoherence matrix computed in @xcite , thus getting the decohered output state .",
    "we chose as physical timescale unit @xmath44 , which corresponds to the upper cut - off frequency . in charge qubits in gaas",
    "we typically have @xmath45 this leads to the decay of the off - diagonal elements of the n - qubit density matrix .",
    "the structure of this decay is non - trivial and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] . in general",
    ", this leads to an error , which can not be reduced to a single qubit error .",
    "in addition , this decoherence model does not take into account any relaxation the system might be subject to .",
    "we assume that the relaxation is independent of decoherence , and also that energy loss for each qubit is independent .",
    "for each two dimensional quantum subsystem , if @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to the two position eigenstates , then the two energy eigenstates are @xmath46 for the ground state , and @xmath47 for the excited state .",
    "we can then compute the effect of relaxation by operating a tensor product of amplitude damping channels to each qubit in the register , where the operation elements ( [ eq : adc ] ) are in the @xmath48 basis .",
    "the decay parameter @xmath39 is time @xmath49 and temperature @xmath50 dependent , @xmath51 setting @xmath52 .",
    "since our quantum register is subject to noise , we want to encode an input quantum state in such a way that we can preserve the quantum information even when the physical system undergoes noise .",
    "a general framework for doing this is quantum error correction ( qec ) @xcite , which encode a logical qubit containing the quantum information on multiple physical qubits , and then usually by performing syndrome measurements on these physical qubits , we can determine a certain set of errors , and apply the corresponding correction @xcite . many quantum error correcting codes ( qecc ) have been found that can correct an arbitrary error on a single physical qubit , and it is known that the smallest such codes require 5 physical qubits @xcite .",
    "one of these 5 qubit codes is the divincenzo - shor qecc @xcite .",
    "the code words for the logical states @xmath53 are @xcite : @xmath54 with stabilizers @xcite : @xmath55 which leave the code invariant .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 operators are respectively the @xmath56 and @xmath57 pauli operators",
    ". the encoding circuit can be seen in @xcite .",
    "this is a perfect non - degenerate code , meaning that all single qubit errors map to a different syndrome , as can be seen in table [ tb : error ] . to obtain a measurement of the error syndrome , we measure observables in the eigenbasis of each of the four stabilizers in ( [ eq : code ] ) , and depending on the outcome of these four measurements we apply the corresponding correction from table [ tb : error ] .    an alternative to these multi - qubit measurements",
    "@xcite is to use ancillary qubits to conditionnally apply each of the four stabilizers on a @xmath58 state , thus recording the phase ( m0-m3 have eigenvalues @xmath59 ) .",
    "measuring these four ancilla qubits in the @xmath48 basis then gives the same result as above without having to perform multi - qubit measurements .",
    "this syndrome measurement circuit is given in @xcite .",
    ".table of the different possible single qubit errors @xmath60 , with their associated syndrome measurement output @xmath61 , which has binary expension @xmath62 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      when combining the effect of decoherence and relaxation , the frequency of error correction is on the order of what is needed for relaxation , since relaxation is much harder to correct than decoherence . here too , when taking into account decoherence and relaxation , we are still able to maintain the fidelity arbitrarily close to one ( see fig . [",
    "fig : scale ] ) .",
    "this tells us that even though it may require a high frequency of quantum error correction , the 5 qubit code is able to correct a realistic multi - qubit error system .    .",
    "the high - frequency qec for joint decoherence and relaxation enables the quantum information to be preserved almost perfectly .",
    "the input qubit is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : decoh].,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      we have only considered noise in the n - qubit system .",
    "that is , an important assumption made for our simulation is that of a perfect operation of the qec algorithm .",
    "however , in a realistic fault - tolerant quantum computation ( ftqc ) @xcite , errors will also occur within the operation of the gates and measurements , and this also during the qec steps .",
    "similar concerns led some physicists to wonder if the error model adopted to get to the threshold theorem @xcite for ftqc is physical enough so that ftqc is possible at all @xcite .",
    "hence , such a simulation , with a realistic model for operations , would be an important step toward determining if physical implementations of quantum computers are possible .",
    "it is possible that these types of errors can be corrected in a similar manner , but this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the model considered introduces multi - qubit errors , which are much smaller than full single - qubit ones when the time evolution is very short . at the lowest order",
    ", we showed that these small multi - qubit errors can be corrected by single - qubit qec codes .",
    "however , this increases the required qec frequency , but it is certainly possible to find other error correcting schemes optimized for multi - qubit errors , which would require a lower qec frequency .    also , since the decoherence time for charge qubits is short , the frequency of qec required to maintain good fidelity for extended periods is too high to be feasible experimentally with current techniques .",
    "however , this is a proof of principle and it is reasonable to expect that for other implementations of qubits like spin qubits or superconducting qubits , where decoherence times can be much longer , similar performances would require a qec frequency that is attainable experimentally .",
    "we have simulated the implementation of the 5 qubit divincenzo - shor qecc for a charge qubit quantum register .",
    "the register was subjected to a realistic noise model , consisting of decoherence and relaxation .",
    "even though the qecc is designed to perfectly correct only single qubit errors , an application of the qec routine with a high enough frequency was able to limit the effect of multi - qubit errors introduced by our noise model .",
    "in fact , by adjusting the frequency of error correction , we can get the fidelity as close to one as possible , and for extended periods of time .",
    "when considering both types of noise separately , relaxation showed to be harder to error correct than decoherence , requiring higher frequency of qec for the same results .",
