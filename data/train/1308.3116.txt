    "( [ eq : mod_schwinger ] ) can be used to study the evolution of the @xmath11-parton distribution functions . to this end , we will focus on the behaviour of parton densities in the large bjorken-@xmath0 approximation .",
    "describing the three - dimensional structure of the nucleon is one of the hot topics of a number of current and planned experimental and theoretical projects ( see [ ] and references therein ) . in the infinite - momentum frame ( imf ) , the nucleon can be treated as a complicated quantum many - body system of point - like constituents ( partons ) .",
    "these partons can be probed in high - energy scattering processes with a spatial resolution equal to the inverse momentum transfer @xmath23 . the energy transfer is then related to the bjorken variable @xmath0 , which defines as well the fraction of the nucleon s longitudinal momentum carried by the struck parton .",
    "the region of @xmath24 features the predominance of the three valence quarks inside the nucleon , while the effects of sea quarks become significant in the region of @xmath25 , and gluons are known to dominate at even smaller @xmath0 .",
    "past studies of fully inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) heavily relayed on the imf framework , using factorization to separate out ir and collinear singularities , the latter being collected from the hard ( perturbatively calculable ) part into the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . in this case , it suffices to treat the struck parton as collinear with the parent nucleon .",
    "deep inelastic electron - nucleon scattering experiments deliver , therefore , the information about the one - dimensional ( longitudinal ) structure of the nucleon . in semi - inclusive processes ( such as drell - yan , sidis , etc . ) , however , it is necessary to additionally incorporate the intrinsic transversal degrees of freedom of the struck partons , and in specific processes one also has to add possible spin - correlations to the pdfs .",
    "this information is delivered by the transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) , providing a full three - dimensional picture of the nucleon structure .",
    "a promising setup to investigate the behaviour of @xmath11 parton densities at large @xmath0 is the new energy upgrade from 6 to 12 gev of cebaf at jefferson lab , which is being effectuated at the moment [ ] .",
    "cebaf is a fixed - target experiment , so one has @xmath26 , implying that this upgrade will allow us to probe the region @xmath0 from @xmath27 up to very close to 1 , in other words one will probe mainly valence quarks .",
    "this is ideal to study the evolution of density functions in the so far unexplored large-@xmath0 region . on the other hand , smaller @xmath0 ( in the same region of values of @xmath28 )",
    "can be reached by the planned eic , which will target sea quarks and gluons as well [ ] .",
    "the combined kinematic range of both experiments will be of the order to @xmath29 and @xmath30 gev@xmath31 gev@xmath32 .",
    "this coverage is unique in its large-@xmath0 component , which will allow us to make precision tests of tmd factorization and evolution .",
    "for the extended original discussion and figures , see [ ] and refs . therein .",
    "three - dimensional parton densities in the momentum representation ( tmds ) are intensively studied within different frameworks , refs .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to compare advantages and drawbacks of those approaches .",
    "instead , we will just take it for granted that some reasonable tmd - factorization scheme can be formulated , and that an appropriate operator definition of the tmd quark distribution function exists that has the same quantum numbers as the correlation function below , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdd_general ] ) . in the present discussion",
    "we will be particularly concerned with the @xmath11-correlation functions in the large-@xmath0 limit : this regime is apparently easier to analyze within a simple factorization scheme and perfectly fits the jefferson lab 12 gev kinematics .",
    "furthermore , we will argue that the large-@xmath0 approximation is an ideal natural laboratory for the study of applications of the generalized loop space formalism in hadronic and nuclear physics .    to this end , let us consider the following _ transverse - distance dependent _ ( tdd ) correlation function @xmath33 { \\cal w}_{\\bm l}^\\dagger[\\infty^- ,   { \\bm b}_\\perp ;     \\infty^- ,   { \\infty}_\\perp ] \\right .    \\\\     & & \\left",

    "the large-@xmath0 regime suggests the following assumptions ( for a detailed discussion , see ref . [ ] ) :    * in the imf , the struck quark acquires `` almost all '' the momentum of the nucleon , that is : @xmath39 .",
    "provided that the transverse component of the nucleon momentum is equal to zero , the transverse momentum of the quark @xmath40 is gained by the gluon interactions ; * a very fast moving quark with momentum @xmath41 can be considered as a classical particle with a ( dimensionless ) velocity parallel to the nucleon momentum @xmath42 , so that the quark fields are replaced by @xmath43 \\",

    "in other words , rapidity divergences are known to originate from the minus - infinite rapidity region , where gluons travel along the direction of the outgoing jet , not incoming - collinear ; * real contributions are uv - finite ( in contrast to the integrated pdfs ) , but can contain rapidity singularities and a non - trivial @xmath0- and @xmath47-dependence .",
    "these assumptions imply the following large-@xmath0 factorization formula : @xmath48 where the contribution of incoming - collinear partons is summed up into the @xmath0-independent function , while the soft function @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 { \\cal w}_{n^-}^\\dag[z ; \\infty ] { \\cal w}_{n^- } [ \\infty ; 0 ] { \\cal w}_p [ 0 ; \\infty ] \\   | 0 \\rangle \\",

    "( [ eq : tdd_evolution_1 ] ) is , in fact , @xmath57-independent and contains only a single - log dependence on the rapidity [ ] .",

    "( [ eq : tdd_evolution_2 ] ) corresponds to the collins - soper - sterman rapidity - independent kernel @xmath58 . at this point , we are in a position to make use of the evolution equation ( [ eq : mod_schwinger ] ) . to this end , we emphasize that the soft function @xmath59 is a fourier transform of an element of the loop space : the wilson loop evaluated along the path , defined in eq .",

    "therefore : @xmath62 equations ( [ eq : tdd_evolution_1]-[eq : css ] ) can be straightforwardly integrated to give a complete evolution of the tdd ( [ eq : tdd_general ] ) in the large-@xmath0 region [ ] , which can be directly applied to the jlab 12 gev phenomenology ( see also [ ] and refs . therein ) .",
    "we have shown that the geometrical properties of the generalized loop space can be used to analyze the combined rapidity and rg - evolution of the transverse - distance dependent parton densities in the large-@xmath0 approximation .",
    "this regime allows one to factorize the soft contributions responsible for the non - trivial @xmath0- and @xmath47-dependence in the form of vacuum averages of the system of wilson lines lying on- and off- the light - cone .",
    "it is crucial that the rapidity divergences get factorized into the soft part as well , while incoming - collinear jets contribute to the renormalization - group evolution via the corresponding anomalous dimensions .",
    "being an element of the generalized loop space , the soft function @xmath49 obeys the equations of motion , which describe its behaviour under the shape variations of the specially chosen form .",
    "the latter can be connected with the rapidity differentials in the energy - momentum space . although the differential equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tdd_evolution_1]-[eq : css ] ) , coincide with the ones obtained in other approaches [ ] , their solution seems to be easier due to the simpler structure of the integration constants and the more straightforward relation to the integrated case .",

    "<S> we discuss possible applications of the equations of motion in the generalized wilson loop space to the phenomenology of the three - dimensional parton distribution functions in the large-@xmath0 approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this regime is relevant for future experimental programs to be launched at the ( approved ) jefferson lab @xmath1 gev upgrade and the ( planned ) electron - ion collider . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the geometrical evolution of the wilson loops corresponds to the combined rapidity and renormalization - group equation of the transverse - distance dependent parton densities in the large-@xmath0 factorization scheme . </S>"
