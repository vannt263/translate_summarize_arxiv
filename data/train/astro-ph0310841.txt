    "a substantial body of modern theoretical cosmology is concerned with the theory of small metric perturbations about friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmologies . in particular , cosmologists often derive exact formulae for observables in such spacetimes and then apply standard statistical techniques in recognition of the stochastic nature of the perturbations .",
    "a great benefit of such a programme is that correlations between effects previously treated as distinct may be used to illuminate cosmological questions .",
    "as astronomers and cosmologists work with ever more distant sources , it becomes increasingly important to understand and account for the deviations of our universe from the simple flrw spacetimes .",
    "one example , among many , where such an understanding is important is in the use of type ia supernovae as standard candles to infer luminosity distance as a function of source redshift , and hence to demonstrate that the universe is currently in a phase of accelerated expansion ( reiss et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the inference that the universe is accelerating was made on the basis of the luminosity distance formula appropriate for the background cosmology , not to the perturbed cosmology in which we live .",
    "the gravitational effects of large - scale structure were taken to contribute to the error budget at a level determined by the numerical studies of wambsganss et al .",
    ". gravitational lensing by large - scale structure is known to produce effects on the order of those found in these numerical studies , and this is usually assumed to be the dominant effect on the luminosity distance ( kantowski , vaughan & branch 1995 ; holz & wald 1998 ; holz 1998 ; kaiser 1998 ) .",
    "however , so far as we know , no rigorous exploration of this assumption has been attempted . in any case",
    ", the division of the effects of large - scale structure into categories such as lensing , time - delays , and others is largely artificial : we measure luminosities and redshifts in the real universe and no idealized flrw background exists .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the luminosity distance in linearly perturbed flrw spacetimes .",
    "our results are obtained by direct integration of the geodesic equations .",
    "a complementary approach has been employed by sasaki ( 1987 ) .",
    "our results improve on those of sasaki in two ways .",
    "first , we present explicit formulae for curved cases , whereas sasaki s solutions in these cases require a prior integration of the perturbed geodesic equations .",
    "second , our formulae are functions only of standard cosmological parameters and observational quantities .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we derive a formula for the luminosity distance , accurate to first order , in metric perturbed flrw spacetimes . in section  [ sec : lensing ]",
    "we evaluate the cosmological weak lensing correction to the usual luminosity distance as a function of redshift in two model flat spacetimes , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "in any spacetime there is a relation between the element of cross - sectional area of a radiation source , @xmath13 , and the solid angle that this source is observed to subtend at an observer , @xmath14 .",
    "although @xmath13 is unobservable , this relation is usually used to define a distance measure @xmath15 , the angular - diameter distance , according to @xmath16 . in a general spacetime",
    "@xmath15 will depend upon the particular locations of the source and observer , and possibly also on the choice of multiple null paths along which the source is observed .",
    "in perfectly homogeneous and isotropic flrw spacetimes @xmath15 depends only upon the observed redshift of the source and the cosmological parameters describing the evolution of the scale factor : the density parameters in matter , curvature , and cosmological constant and the hubble constant , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in any spacetime , the luminosity distance , @xmath21 ,",

    "most seriously , it exhibits explicit dependence on the unobservable point of emission @xmath30 rather than on the observable redshift .",

    "we proceed to remedy both defects .",

    "since @xmath31 and @xmath52 will differ only at first order , and ( [ eq : path2 ] ) is valid only to this order , we can replace @xmath31 by @xmath52 in ( [ eq : path2 ] ) without further modification .",
