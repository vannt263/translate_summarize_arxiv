    "the interesting properties of tmos arise because of the competition between the crystal - field splitting ( which arises because of covalency between transition metal @xmath5 and oxygen @xmath6 states ) , on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath7 , hund s coupling , spin - orbit ( so ) coupling due to orbital degeneracy ( leading to unquenched angular moment in the ground state ) , and different spin - exchange pathways .    in this regard , the discovery of a spin - orbital mott state in sr@xmath8iro@xmath9 by kim _ _",

    ", the lower and higher sets of bands within the @xmath2 manifold would correspond to effective total angular momenta @xmath1 of 3/2 and 1/2 , respectively .",
    "this is similar to the case of sr@xmath8iro@xmath9 where the spin - orbit coupling splits the ir @xmath2 bands into a lower lying quartet of @xmath1 = 3/2 and a higher lying doublet of @xmath1 = 1/2 bands.@xcite in the case of cairo@xmath0 , the @xmath1 = 1/2 bands are narrow with a width of @xmath191 ev .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     even though on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath7 and spin - orbit coupling acting alone do not make the system an insulator , it is likely that their combined effect can induce a mott insulating state by splitting the narrow @xmath1 = 1/2 bands .",
    "the lda+so+@xmath7 calculations with @xmath7 = 2.75 ev reveal that this scenario is realized in cairo@xmath0 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bnd - comb](d ) , the @xmath7 in the presence of so coupling makes only minor modifications to the @xmath1 = 3/2 bands .",
    "the @xmath1 = 3/2 bands get exchange split and a degeneracy at the point @xmath39 @xmath40 is lifted , but otherwise the bandwidth and topology of the bands do not change substantially .",
    "however , the half - filled @xmath1 = 1/2 bands , in addition to being exchange split by @xmath190.1 ev , are split into the upper ( uhb ) and lower ( lhb ) hubbard bands , yielding a mott insulating state .",
    "the fully occupied @xmath1 = 1/2 lhb has a small bandwidth of @xmath190.5 ev and is separated from the unoccupied uhb by a gap of @xmath190.33 ev for @xmath7 = 2.75 ev ( the gap is @xmath190.03 ev for @xmath7 = 2 ev ) .",
    "this agrees well with a band gap of 0.34 ev obtained experimentally.@xcite i also performed calculations with @xmath7 = 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , and 2.5 ev .",
    "the system is metallic within lda+so+@xmath7 for @xmath7 up to 1.5 ev , but it becomes an insulator by @xmath7 = 2.0 ev . to see the effect of the hund coupling @xmath41 , i did lda+so+@xmath7 calculations with @xmath7 = 2.75 ev and @xmath41 = 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 ev .",
    "i find that these values of hund coupling @xmath41 do not change the qualitative picture  the ir @xmath2 levels are still split into @xmath1 = 3/2 and 1/2 bands and the @xmath1 = 1/2 bands are further split into fully occupied lhb and unoccupied uhb .",
    "the inclusion of hund coupling mainly reduces the band gap ( for @xmath41 = 0.3 ev , the band gap is 0.30 ev ) and the magnetic moment .",
    "the lda+so+@xmath7 calculations give an antiferromagnetic ground state for cairo@xmath0 along the @xmath3 axis with total moments aligning antiparallel along the @xmath3 axis .",
    "the orbital and spin moments are parallel to each other along the @xmath3 axis and ferromagnetically canted along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the angular and spin expectation values computed over the two ir muffin - tin spheres ir(1 ) ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) and ir(1@xmath42 ) ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 0.5 ) for different @xmath7 and @xmath41 values are given in table [ tab : expect ] . for @xmath7 = 2.75 ev , the total moment is 0.67 @xmath43/ir with an orbital moment of 0.29 @xmath43 and a spin moment of 0.38 @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the canting angle is 10@xmath45 , approximately half the octahedral tilting angle of 22@xmath45 and twice the value of 4@xmath45 reported in ref .  .",
    "the calculated values differ considerably from what is expected for the ideal @xmath1 = 1/2 state . in the ionic limit",
    ", one expects an orbital moment of 0.67 @xmath43 and a spin moment of 0.33 @xmath43 for a @xmath1 = 1/2 state.@xcite in contrast , i obtain an orbital moment that is lower than the spin moment .",
    "the reason for this deviation from the @xmath1 = 1/2 may be the compression and tilting of the iro@xmath33 octahedra , in addition to the covalency between ir @xmath5 and o @xmath6 states . the compression of the iro@xmath33 octahedra will quench the orbital moment as the degeneracy between @xmath2 states are lifted .",
    "also , the tilting of the iro@xmath33 octahedra causes the @xmath32 bands to get mixed with the @xmath2 states .",
    "these two effects should reduce the orbital moment but might enhance the spin contribution .",
    "it is interesting to note that sr@xmath8iro@xmath9 also has distortion of the iro@xmath33 octahedra with a bond - length ratio of 1.04 and a tilting angle of 11@xmath45,@xcite and it has a calculated orbital moment of 0.26 @xmath43 and spin moment of 0.10 @xmath43.@xcite as the tilting angle in cairo@xmath0 is twice that of sr@xmath8iro@xmath9 , it might be reasonable to expect that cairo@xmath0 deviates further from the ideal @xmath1 = 1/2 state due to the mixing of the @xmath32 states .",
    "in summary , the electronic structure and magnetic properties of cairo@xmath0 has been studied using first - principles calculations .",
    "the system is metallic within the lda because the ir @xmath2 states are incompletely filled .",
    "modest values of on - site coulomb repulsion alone have very little effect on the lda electronic structure as the ir @xmath2 states have a broad bandwidth .",
    "the introduction of spin - orbit coupling splits the ir @xmath2 states into fully filled @xmath1 = 3/2 bands and half - filled @xmath1 = 1/2 bands .",
    "the half - filled bands have a small bandwidth of @xmath191.0 ev , which is split into fully filled lower and unfilled upper hubbard bands by a modest value of on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "this topologically non - trivial modification of the lda electronic structure due to the combined effects of spin - orbit coupling and on - site coulomb repulsion results in a mott insulating state that is antiferromagnetically ordered along @xmath3 axis with total moments aligning antiparallel along the @xmath3 axis and canted along the @xmath4 axis . for @xmath7",
    "= 2.75 ev , the total magnetic moment is 0.67 @xmath43 with an orbital contribution of 0.28 @xmath43 and a spin contribution of 0.38 @xmath43 .",
