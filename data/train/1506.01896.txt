    "the x - ray spectra of low mass x - ray binaries with a neutron star ( ns - lmxbs ) mainly depend on the x - ray luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "high luminosity ( @xmath1  erg s@xmath2 ) dominated by thermal component is called `` soft state , '' whereas low luminosity ( @xmath3  erg s@xmath2 ) dominated by the comptonized component is called `` hard state . '' in general , the luminosity is thought to reflect the mass - accretion rate and then the spectral state ( soft or hard ) corresponds to a state of the inner accretion disk ( optically thick or thin ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "spectral states are a key to determine the state of the inner accretion disk .",
    "bright ns - lmxbs have been classified into two groups , z sources and atoll sources , based on their behavior on the color  color diagram and hardness ",
    "intensity diagram @xcite .",
    "z sources are generally bright and sometimes become close to the eddington luminosity ( @xmath4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "atoll sources are generally less bright , and some of them exhibit spectral state transitions ( soft or hard ) . in the color ",
    "color diagram , the shape can be divided into two main regions , `` banana '' and `` island . ''",
    "the spectrum is usually softer in the banana than in the island .",
    "spectral state transitions have been studied for transient x - ray binaries including a neutron star or a black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "usually , these transitions are observed in the rise and decay phases of outbursts , when the luminosity changes by 25 orders of magnitude during outbursts .",
    "@xcite reported that the soft - to - hard transition in the decay phase of the outburst occurs at 1%4% of @xmath4 .",
    "for the hard - to - soft transition in the rise phase of the outburst , the transition luminosity tends to be larger than that in the soft - to - hard transition ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral state transitions have been also observed in four persistent ns - lmxbs : 4u  1636@xmath0536 @xcite , gs  1826@xmath0238 @xcite , 4u  1705@xmath044 @xcite , and 4u  1820@xmath030 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray variability with spectral state transitions means the change of the intrinsic mass accretion rate .",
    "recurrent outburst behavior is interpreted by the thermal viscous disk instability model ( see @xcite for a review ) . in this model ,",
    "local disk instabilities ( s - shaped curves in the surface density and mass accretion rate diagram ) are caused by the partial ionization of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the local instabilities propagate over the whole disk , and when it reaches the innermost part of the accretion disk , an outburst occurs .",
    "mineshige and osaki ( 1983 , 1985 ) investigated the disk instability model for outbursts of dwarf novae .",
    "they reported that instabilities on a constant-@xmath5 disk yield only small - amplitude variabilities , where @xmath5 is the standard viscosity parameter .",
    "this was also pointed out by @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand , by assigning high @xmath5 in a hot state ( upper branch in s - shaped curve ) and low @xmath5 in a cool state ( lower branch ) , the width of the unstable branch ( middle branch ) is extended and the instability can propagate through the whole disk .",
    "the two-@xmath5 disk leads to the large - amplitude outbursts .",
    "mineshige and shields ( 1990a ) studies the similar variability for the disk instability in agn , and then , they named the small and the large amplitude variabilities as `` purr type '' and `` roar type , '' respectively . in this paper",
    ", we propose that some small amplitude variabilities ( mini - outbursts ) detected in ns - lmxbs are considered to be the purr - type outburst .",
    "smak ( 1982 , 1983 ) showed that instability occurs below a critical effective temperature depending on the mass accretion rate .",
    "they classified the cataclysmic variables into two objects on the outer disk radius versus mass accretion rate diagram : stationary - accretion objects ( novae and nova - like stars ) and non stationary - accretion objects ( dwarf novae ) .",
    "external heating by central object may be ignored in white dwarfs , but is non - negligible in ns - lmxbs because the disk is strongly irradiated .",
    "in other words , instability is determined by not only the mass accretion rate , but also the x - ray luminosity .",
    "tuchman , mineshige , and wheeler ( 1990 ) calculated the instability in consideration of the effect of irradiation , and generated the s - shaped curves at different irradiation temperatures .",
    "they concluded that for sufficiently strong irradiation ( irradiation temperature above 10000  k ) , the hydrogen and helium atoms are completely ionized , thus , the thermal instability is suppressed .",
    "@xcite also calculated the effect of external heating and separated persistent ns - lmxbs from transient ns - lmxbs on the orbital period versus x - ray luminosity diagram .",
    "the present study focuses on the properties of the spectral state transitions of transient and persistent ns - lmxbs .",

    "the viscous time scale was given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the mass accretion rate in units of @xmath124 g s@xmath2 , @xmath125 is the neutron star mass of 1.4@xmath126 , and @xmath127 is the outer radius of the accretion disk . assuming that @xmath5 = 0.11 , @xmath123 = 5.3 ( @xmath128  erg s@xmath2 , the maximum luminosity of a mini - outburst ) , and @xmath129  cm ( the @xmath127 of 4u  1636536 ; see figure  [ fig9 ] in the next subsection ) , we obtained @xmath130 1060  d. this time scale is roughly comparable with the typical time scale of a mini - outburst .",
    "furthermore , mineshige and osaki ( 1985 ) predicted a small - amplitude variability ( resembling a mini - outburst ) in the disk instability model , although their calculation assumed a dwarf nova .",
    "we discuss the relation of the mini - outburst and the disk instability model in the next subsection .",
    "the periodic variability observed in ks  1731@xmath0320 is similar to the mini - outbursts in 4u  1636@xmath0536 , although the presence of spectral state transitions is unclear . according to revnivtsev and sunyaev ( 2003 ) ,",
    "ks  1731@xmath0320 exhibited strong variability on a monthly time scale during mjd @xmath31 5110052000 .",
    "they interpreted the periodic variability as disk precession .",
    "the luminosity in the 210  kev band obtained from the public data of asm on rxte , was between @xmath33  erg s@xmath2 and @xmath131  erg s@xmath2 , assuming a distance of 7  kpc @xcite .",
    "the luminosity range of the variability is close to 1%4% of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the variability could result from a repeat of mini - outburst .",
    "@xcite referred the variability in ks  1731@xmath0320 that follows the main outburst as `` echo outbursts . ''",
    "they suggested that echo outbursts are triggered by the configuration of the inner ionized stable region surrounded by the outer unstable region .",
    "they also pointed out the important role of thermal instability of the accretion disk in the luminosity decline .",
    "@xcite also reported that the variability during the x - ray decline in both 4u",
    "1636@xmath0536 and ks  1731@xmath0260 was similar .",
    "they suggested the relation of the variability and the thermal instability of an accretion disk .",
    "normal outbursts in ns - lmxbs are usually interpreted by the disk instability model like the outburst of dwarf novae .",
    "the theoretical disk instability model of mineshige and osaki ( 1983 , 1985 ) predicts both large - amplitude outbursts ( roar type ) and small - amplitude variability ( purr type ) .",
    "the former is considered to correspond to normal outburst , but no correspondence has been found for the latter . here , we propose that purr - type outbursts correspond to mini - outbursts , because the characteristics ( small - amplitude and short duration ) of both types are quite similar .",
    "we now discuss the possibility of the purr - type outburst .",
    "most of the transition luminosities of mini - outbursts were in the range of 1%4% of @xmath4 .",
    "it would indicate that the spectral state transitions are due to the inner disk transitions , which are caused by thermal instability of the outer disk .",
    "the main difference of the two - types instability ( roar type and purr type ) is in the assignment of @xmath5 parameter .",
    "the @xmath5 parameter is usually considered to depend on the disk temperature , although there are several theoretical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to explain a normal outburst ,",
    "a high @xmath5 is assigned in a hot state ( upper branch in s - shape curve ) and a low @xmath5 is assigned in a cool state ( lower branch ) . as a result ,",
    "the s - shape curve is modified and the width of the middle branch is extended .",
    "this means that the instability can propagate through the whole disk ( roar type ) . on the other hand , when the same @xmath5 is assigned in both a hot and cool state ( upper and lower branch ) ,",
    "the width of the middle branch is narrow , and then the instability can not propagate through the whole disk ( purr type ) .    here , we examine the influence of the irradiation on the s - shaped curve .",
    "tuchman , mineshige , and wheeler ( 1990 ) calculated the instability under irradiation and generated the s - shaped curves at different irradiation temperatures ( see figure  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "there are two modifications of the s - shaped curve due to the irradiation .",
    "one is to move the lower branch upward in the diagram and the other is to shorten the width of the middle branch . those two lead to that the @xmath5-value of the lower branch becomes close to that of the upper branch , and then the approximation of a constant-@xmath5 disk would be suitable .",
    "next , we investigate status of the outer disk ( stable or unstable ) assuming that the disk temperature is determined by x - ray heating .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the average x - ray luminosity of the soft ( open circles ) and hard ( filled triangles ) states in the 210  kev band as a function of the outer radius of the accretion disk . here",
    ", the outer radius was assumed as 0.35 of the binary separation @xcite .",
    "the binary separation was estimated by kepler s third law assuming a neutron star mass of 1.4  @xmath126 .",
    "the orbital periods were taken from the lmxb catalogue @xcite and are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the mass of the companion star was taken as 0.4  @xmath126 although the actual mass is uncertain .",
    "4u  1705@xmath044 and xte  j1709@xmath0267 were excluded from this analysis because their orbital periods are not known .",
    "the irradiation temperatures of ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are @xmath132 = 10000  k , 5000  k , and 3000  k , respectively",
    ". , width=302 ]    the theoretical lines of ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) indicate the `` irradiation disk temperatures '' which depended on x - ray heating and was calculated by equation ( 53 ) of @xcite .",
    "the equation ( 53 ) was expressed as @xmath133 here , @xmath132 is called the `` irradiation disk temperature , '' defined by the irradiation flux as @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath135 is the irradiation flux on the disk surface from external heat sources .",
    "the thermal unstable branch ( the middle branch of the s - shaped curve ) disappears for strong irradiation with @xmath136  k. the parameter @xmath137 denotes the fraction of external heat caught by the outer disk .",
    "@xmath138 is the x - ray luminosity of the external heat source and @xmath127 is outer radius of accretion disk .",
    "mineshige , tuchman , and wheeler ( 1990b ) reported that if the irradiation is a function of the mass accretion rate and is not so strong ( @xmath139 and @xmath140  k ) , the model can reproduce the observed light variations of dwarf novae and it is relevant to the outburst of soft x - ray transients with large amplitudes ( roar type ) .",
    "thus , we adopted @xmath141 and drew the three theoretical lines of ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) . the irradiation temperatures of ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are @xmath132 = 10000  k , 5000  k , and 3000  k , respectively .",
    "the line of ( a ) separates the stable and unstable regions .",
    "the left side of the line of ( a ) indicates the stable region ( fully ionized region ) .",
    "the region between line ( a ) and ( b ) indicate the unstable region where the normal outburst ( roar type ) would not occur although the borderline depends on the model parameter such as @xmath137 .",
    "thus , in the region between ( a ) and ( b ) , a constant-@xmath5 disk would be applicable and then the purr - type instability would occur .",
    "in other words , the observed mini - outbursts are interpreted as the instability of the purr type in this region .    in figure  [ fig10 ] , except for 4u  1820@xmath030 , all four sources have the unstable region between ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is consistent with the results that mini - outbursts ( purr type ) were observed in 4u  1636@xmath0536 , gs  1826@xmath0238 , and 4u  1608@xmath052 .",
    "however , in aql  x-1 , the mini - outbursts were not observed in our observations .",
    "we suggest that it relevant to the short period of hard - high state defined by matsuoka and asai ( 2013 ) . for both 4u  1636@xmath0536 and gs  1826@xmath0238 ( persistent sources ) ,",
    "the outer radii at the hard - state luminosity locate on the left side of ( b ) , which means the normal outburst ( roar type ) would not occur at these luminosities .",
    "it is consistent with the results that normal outbursts have not been observed in both sources . on the other hand , for both 4u  1608@xmath052 and aql  x-1 ( transient sources ) , the outer radius at the hard - state luminosity locate on the right side of ( b ) , where the normal outburst ( roar type ) would occur .",
    "it supports that the normal outburst in ns - lmxb is caused by disk instability in the same way of dwarf novae , which has been pointed out by @xcite .",
    "variability lasting several tens of days , which are often observed in the hard state of ns - lmxbs , might result from a repeat of mini - outburst although they do not accompany spectral state transitions .",
    "such variability was observed in both 4u  1608@xmath052 and 4u  1636@xmath0536 . in 4u  1608@xmath052 ,",
    "variabilities without spectral state transitions were observed during mjd = 5670056100 ( hard - high state ) . in 4u  1636@xmath0536 ,",
    "variabilities in the period after mjd @xmath31 56000 do not always accompany spectral state transition . because the maximum luminosity of the variability was below the transition luminosity , inner disk state transition would not occur",
    "we investigated the spectral state transitions in bright ns - lmxbs using the one - day bin light curves of maxi / gsc and swift / bat . in four of the sources ( 4u  1636@xmath0536 ,",
    "gs  1826@xmath0238 , 4u  1705@xmath044 , and 4u  1608@xmath052 ) , we detected small - amplitude x - ray variabilities with spectral state transitions .",
    "we named these variabilities `` mini - outbursts '' and interpreted them as disk instability based on a constant-@xmath5 disk by mineshige and osaki ( 1985 ) . in the case of mini - outburst ,",
    "the s - shaped curves in the surface density and mass accretion rate diagram , are modified by the irradiation , and then the approximation of a constant-@xmath5 disk would be suitable . here , we call mini - outburst as `` purr - type outburst '' referring to theoretical studies by mineshige and shields ( 1990a ) .",
    "we also suggest that variabilities in the hard state may be a repeat of mini - outbursts even if spectral state transitions do not occur . in this case",
