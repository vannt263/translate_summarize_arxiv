    "it has been known for some time that the effects of heavy dynamical fermions can be included in monte carlo simulations using a hopping parameter expansion of the fermion determinant .",
    "this is done routinely in perturbative qed where electron loops are included in an effective action .",
    "recently hasenfratz and degrand @xcite@xcite have performed a zero - temperature calculation of the shift in the lattice gauge coupling constant induced by staggered dynamical fermions and applied the result to the finite temperature phase transition in qcd .",
    "their result for the shift in the critical coupling , in the form @xmath4 , was found to hold rather well down to small values of the fermion mass , even for @xmath5 ; this is particularly surprising since @xmath6 is calculated using lattice perturbation theory at zero - temperature . in order to understand the effects of finite temperature , we have calculated the one - loop fermionic corrections to the spatial and temporal plaquette couplings , as well as the leading @xmath0 symmetry breaking coupling .",

    "this manifests itself as separate renormalizations of the spatial and temporal gauge couplings .",
    "we find that @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 a different result is obtained for @xmath19 by replacing @xmath20 in ( 7 ) with @xmath21 .",
    "figure 1 compares @xmath22 per fermion ( spatial and temporal ) vs. @xmath2 for @xmath5 and @xmath23 with the zero temperature result of hasenfratz and degrand .",
    "the finite temperature values approach the zero temperature result from below as a consequence of the antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "note that they ruin the agreement between the zero - temperature calculation and the monte carlo results for intermediate to large values of @xmath2 .",
    "the connection between the the zero and finite temperature result can be understood more physically by transforming the sum over matsubara frequencies into a sum over images using the poisson summation formula for antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the shift in the spatial plaquette coupling is then given by @xmath24 with a similar result for @xmath19 .",
    "this form has a simple physical interpretation : the integer @xmath25 labels the net number of times the fermion wraps around the lattice in the temporal direction .",
    "numerically , the dominant corrections to the zero - temperature result come from the first few values of @xmath25 , with the @xmath26 and @xmath27 terms accounting for more than @xmath28 of the finite temperature correction for @xmath29",
    ".    the finite temperature corrections result from the @xmath7 expansion of image diagrams such as those depicted in figure 2 .",
    "the vertical segments of the image diagrams are powers of polyakov loops . given that @xmath30 symmetry is maintained in the confined phase of qcd , the contibutions of these terms is negligible below @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the finite temperature corrections to @xmath3 may be suppressed nonperturbatively in the confined regime . in particular ,",
    "near @xmath31 the zero - temperature result will hold for @xmath22 .",
    "there is another set of terms induced by the fermion determinant at finite temperature @xcite . using the hopping parameter expansion and the poisson summation formula",

    "we find @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and increasingly smaller values for higher order couplings .",
    "including just the @xmath39 term in the action of an otherwise pure qcd monte carlo simulation , we observe that this additional source of @xmath22 is small compared to the renormalization of the plaquette couplings discussed in the preceeding section .",
    "for example , even @xmath40 at @xmath5 leads to a shift in @xmath3 per fermion of @xmath41 .",
    "this value of @xmath39 corresponds to @xmath42 which yields a zero - temperature predicted shift in @xmath3 per fermion of @xmath43 .    the effect of the @xmath39 term in the effective action , however , is not trivial .",
    "we find a first - order phase transition for values of @xmath39 smaller than approximately @xmath44 . including zero - temperature plaquette coupling renormalization , the endpoint of this first - order phase transition line maps to the point @xmath45 in the @xmath46-plane for the case of sixteen degenerate staggered fermion species .",
    "this is near the endpoint of the first - order phase transition observed in simulations with dynamical staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "a variety of workstations were used to obtain the results presented in this section .",
    "typically @xmath47 sweeps were made on @xmath48 lattices .",
    "definitive numerics will require substantially greater computational resources .",
    "finite temperature corrections to the gauge coupling renormalization lift the degeneracy of the spatial and temporal couplings , but the results are in conflict with monte carlo data . an additional finite temperature shift in @xmath3 , due to an induced coupling to polyakov loops , is negligible .",
    "this coupling does , however , influence the order of the transition and may be the most important factor in determining the end point of the first - order deconfinement phase transition line .",
    "as we have shown , it is plausible that the success of the zero - temperature calculation in determining the critical value of @xmath3 is due to a nonperturbative suppression of finite temperature effects in the low temperature regime .",
    "specifically , the small expectation value of the polyakov loops at low temperatures indicates a suppression of those quark paths which account for finite temperature corrections .",
