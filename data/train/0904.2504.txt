    "the physics of ultracold atoms has attracted a lot of interest since the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation in dilute alkali - metal atom gases  @xcite .",
    "besides the exciting physics at ultracold energies by itself , a further important progress was the loading of the ultracold gas into an optical lattice formed with the aid of standing light waves  @xcite .",
    "the optical lattice resembles in some sense the periodicity of a crystal potential  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to real solids the lattice parameters are , however , easily tunable by a variation of the laser intensity ( trap depth ) or wavelength ( lattice geometry ) . moreover ,",
    "different atoms possess different interaction potentials that can be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "while different kinds of chemical elements , their isotopes , or atoms in different electronic or spin states cover already quite some range of interaction strengths , a further tunability of the atom - atom interactions in optical lattices can be achieved using magnetic feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "close to the resonance value of the magnetic field the interaction varies in a wide range of attractive and repulsive values .",
    "ultracold atoms deposited in light crystals are ideal systems for a realization of the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "this model takes into account a single band of a static lattice potential and assumes the interactions to be purely local  @xcite ( low tunneling limit ) . in this case the optical lattice is considered as an array with a very small filling rate ; optimally with one or two atoms per lattice site .",
    "the experimental study of a bosonic mott insulator  @xcite and a fermionic band insulator  @xcite provided such a system .",
    "the fact that the analysis of a single site is sufficient for such systems simplifies their theoretical description drastically .",
    "another interesting aspect is that ultracold atoms can bind together to form ultracold molecules .",
    "the optical lattice can shield the often fragile , very weakly bound molecules from destructive three - body collisions .",
    "the physics of ultracold atom pairs in optical lattices with controllable interactions is thus presently an intensively investigated research area .",
    "recently the observation of confinement - induced molecules , repulsively interacting pairs , and real molecules for both homonuclear  @xcite and heteronuclear  @xcite atomic species in optical lattices has been reported .    in order to describe the behavior of atoms in an optical lattice the latter",
    "is usually considered as an array of harmonic traps .",
    "in such an approach some important features of the optical lattice can be lost .",
    "for example , the correct sinusoidal potential exhibits an energy band with a spread of transition energies while the harmonic potential possesses a discrete equidistant spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the experiment of stferle et al .",
    "@xcite showed good agreement with a simplified theoretical description based on the harmonic approximation . in their analysis ,",
    "stferle et al .",
    "compared the measured binding energies of confinement - induced molecules and real molecules to the ones predicted by a simplified theory in which two atoms are trapped in a harmonic potential and interact _ via _ a @xmath0-function pseudopotential .",
    "within such a model an analytical solution exists in the case of two identical atoms ( in the same quantum states ) @xcite .",
    "however , another experiment that adopted higher resolution spectroscopy and considered a heteronuclear system was interpreted to clearly indicate a break - down of the harmonic approximation  @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the description of two atoms in an optical lattice beyond the harmonic approximation is very laborious .",
    "the anharmonic part of the optical lattice potential leads to a coupling of center - of - mass and relative motion and requires therefore to solve the full six - dimensional problem .",
    "in fact , even within the harmonic approximation different trapping potentials experienced by the two atoms lead to a coupling of center - of - mass and relative motion  @xcite .",
    "this situation occurs , e.g. , for heteronuclear atom pairs or two atoms of the same kind but in different electronic states .    in this work",
    "a numerical approach is developed that allows in principle to describe two atoms trapped in an optical lattice in an exact way , if the interatomic interaction potential is central ( isotropic ) and can be given in terms of a single potential curve .",
    "the fact that this latter curve stems usually from a full molecular calculation and is only given in numerical form is explicitly considered .",
    "extensions to non - central ( like dipolar ) interactions are rather straightforward and planned for the near future .",
    "the anharmonic coupling is treated in a configuration - interaction ( ci ) like fashion also known as exact diagonalization .",
    "it leads for sufficiently large expansion lengths to exact results .",
    "although the approach allows to consider multiple - well potentials and thus more than a single site of an optical lattice  @xcite , the present work focuses on results obtained for two atoms in a single site .",
    "motivated by the experiment reported in  @xcite the heteronuclear atom pair formed by fermionic @xmath1k and bosonic @xmath2rb was used as a generic system in the present study . in order to investigate the influence of the atomic interaction strength ,",
    "its value was varied artificially by a controlled manipulation of the inner wall of the corresponding potential curve . for the investigation of the influence of the mass difference on the results , two other heteronuclear pairs , @xmath3li-@xmath4li (",
    "almost equal masses ) and @xmath3li-@xmath5cs ( very large mass difference ) were considered . after a systematic investigation of the effects of anharmonicity and coupling of center - of - mass and relative motion a comparison to the experimental data  @xcite as well as to a subsequent theoretical analysis  @xcite performed in parallel to the present work",
    "is given .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec.[sec : system ] the theoretical approach is described .",
    "this includes the formulation of the problem in sec.[subsec : hamilt ] as well as a description of the trap parameters ( sec.[subsec : traparam ] ) , the used interatomic interaction potentials ( sec.[subsec : inin ] ) , and its systematic variation in sec.[subsec : manofinin ] .",
    "the section ends with the computational details described in sec.[subsec : compdet ] .",
    "the results presented in sec.[sec : results ] are first discussed in terms of energies ( and their differences ) for the generic @xmath2rb-@xmath1k dimer in sec.[subsec : spectrum ] ) and for other dimers in sec./[subsec : othsys ] .",
    "this is followed by an analysis of the radial pair densities ( sec.[subsec : raddens ] ) and the wavefunctions in absolute coordinates ( sec.[subsec : wfabsolute ] ) .",
    "this is followed by a comparison to the experimental and recent alternative theoretical results in sec.[subsec : compthexp ] .",
    "finally , a conclusion and outlook is given in sec.[sec : outlook ] .",
    "all equations and quantities in this paper are given in atomic units unless otherwise specified .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction of two atoms with coordinate vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 trapped in a three - dimensional optical lattice is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the kinetic energy operator for particle @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the atom - atom interaction potential , and @xmath12 is the trapping potential for particle @xmath10 . for optical lattices",
    "@xmath12 is often ( and also in the present work ) given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the potential depth which particle @xmath10 experiences along direction @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the wave vector and @xmath17 the wavelength of the laser creating the lattice potential along the ( cartesian ) coordinate @xmath15 . a direct solution of the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian given in the form of eq.([eq : origham ] ) is complicated , since @xmath11 depends in general on all six coordinates describing the two - particle system , even if the atom - atom interaction is central , i.e.  @xmath18 with @xmath19 . for realistic interatomic interaction potentials ( that are usually even only known numerically ) , there is no separability and this leads to very demanding six - dimensional integrals .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to treat the two - particle problem in center - of - mass ( com ) and relative ( rel ) motion coordinates .",
    "if spherical coordinates are adopted , a central interaction potential leads to a function of the radial coordinate only .    on the other hand ,",
    "the formulation of the two - particle problem in com and rel coordinates complicates the treatment of the trap potential , since its separability in cartesian coordinates is lost in the com and rel coordinate system .",
    "however , performing a taylor expansion of the sinusoidal trapping potential  ( [ eq : sinform ] ) around the origin simplifies the problem drastically , because the angular parts can be analytically solved for in the case of a central interatomic interaction potential . for two identical atoms in the same state",
    "the use of the harmonic approximation for the trapping potential leads even to a problem that is completely separable in com and rel coordinates  @xcite .",
    "if the true atom - atom interaction is , furthermore , replaced by a @xmath0-function pseudopotential that reproduces only asymptotically the two - body zero - energy s - wave scattering , the schrdinger equation possesses an analytical solution for both isotropic or anisotropic harmonic traps  @xcite .",
    "noteworthy , even within the harmonic approximation the separability is lost , if the two atoms experience different trapping potentials .",
    "this is the case , if a heteronuclear system or two identical atoms in different electronic states are considered .    after performing the taylor expansion of the sinusoidal trapping potential  ( [ eq : sinform ] ) around the origin , the transformation of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : origham ] ) into the com and rel coordinate systems leads to a hamiltonian of the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 it is worth emphasizing that in the present formulation only the truly non - separable terms ( represented by products of com and rel coordinates )",
    "are left in the coupling term @xmath22 .",
    "all separable terms of the optical lattice ( ol ) potential are included into the com and rel hamiltonians @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .    in a first step ,",
    "the eigenstates and -values of the com and rel hamiltonians are obtained independently of each other by means of a numerical solution of the corresponding stationary schrdinger equations,@xmath25 the wavefunctions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are then used to form the configuration state functions @xmath28 . the stationary schrdinger equation with the full hamiltonian given in eq.([eq",
    ": fullham]),@xmath29 is then solved by expanding @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "insertion of this expansion into eq.([eq : fullschroed ] ) leads ( after the usual manipulations ) to a matrix eigenvalue problem that is solved numerically and yields the energies @xmath32 and eigenvector coefficients @xmath33 .      despite the already mentioned breakdown of the harmonic approximation especially for heteronuclear systems",
    "it is still convenient to introduce the mean harmonic - oscillator frequencies @xmath34 and @xmath35 of a single lattice site for the rel and com motion respectively , @xmath36 in eqs .",

    "( [ eq : omegaheteronuc ] ) reduces to the well - known relation @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "some parameters of the trap chosen in the present study were motivated by the recent experiment reported in  @xcite . therein a three - dimensional optical lattice generated by lasers with wavelength @xmath49 of 1030 nm was used for the trapping of ultracold bosonic @xmath2rb and fermionic @xmath1k atoms .",
    "the two different lattice depths @xmath50 and @xmath51 were considered where the individual recoil energy is defined , e.g. , as @xmath52 . since the static dipole polarizabilities of rubidium and potassium are different , @xmath53a.u .  and @xmath54a.u .",
    "@xcite , the two atoms experience different potentials : @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the mean harmonic - oscillator frequencies  ( [ eq : omegaheteronuc ] ) are @xmath59  khz and @xmath60  khz .",
    "while most of the results of this work are obtained for these frequencies , some other values are also considered in order to investigate the influence of the trap frequency in more detail .",
    "the interaction between rubidium and potassium atoms is modeled using the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potential of the @xmath61 electronic state describing the interaction of two spin - polarized atoms . in general",
    "the atom - atom interaction potentials are only known numerically . for the short - range part @xmath62 of the potential in between",
    "@xmath63 $ ] the data of  @xcite are used ( @xmath64 is the bohr radius ) .",
    "the data points at @xmath65 and @xmath66 have been omitted , because their inclusion results in a non - smooth potential curve .",
    "the long range part @xmath67 of the @xmath61 electronic state is constructed in a similar way as was done by zemke et al .",
    "therefore , this long range part is defined as @xmath68 for @xmath69 where @xmath70 and the dispersion coefficients @xmath71 are the values of derevianko and co - workers  @xcite except @xmath72a.u . which was taken from  @xcite .",
    "the exchange interaction is given by @xmath73 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 as given in  @xcite .",
    "to merge the short- and the long - range parts the short - range part is raised up by half of the value @xmath77 . according to  @xcite the @xmath78 state supports 32 bound states and the interaction of the atoms via the @xmath79 potential is strong and repulsive .",
    "the same amount of bound states and the same character of the interaction are observed in the present calculation using the potential curve constructed the way described above .    in order to study the influence of different masses , polarizabilities , different interaction potentials , and also to check the generality of the conclusions of this work other systems are also analyzed . in particular , the heteronuclear @xmath3li-@xmath4li and @xmath3li-@xmath5cs pairs interacting via their respective @xmath61 electronic state are considered .",
    "the potential curves for @xmath3li-@xmath4li and @xmath3li-@xmath5cs were constructed according to  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .      in the limit of zero collision energy",
    "the interaction between two atoms can be characterized by their s - wave scattering length @xmath80 .",
    "the sign of @xmath80 determines the type of interaction ( repulsive or attractive ) and the absolute value determines the interaction strength .",
    "experimentally it is difficult to accurately measure the scattering length .",
    "for example , there is no agreement about the value of the triplet scattering length for the @xmath2rb-@xmath1k system . according to the ongoing discussion  @xcite the value @xmath81 appears to be the most reliable one . a standard way to match",
    "the calculated scattering length with the experimental value is a smooth shift of the inner wall of the bo potential as is described in  @xcite .",
    "this procedure can also be used for an effective variation of the scattering length since a systematic variation of the inner wall allows to shift the least bound ( lb ) state supported by the potential curve as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "if the least bound state is close to the dissociation threshold or moves even into the dissociative continuum , the scattering length and thus the interaction between the ultracold atoms are strongly influenced .",
    "therefore , a small variation of the inner wall of the potential can modify the interatomic interaction potential from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive .",
    "this procedure is adopted in the present work in order to investigate the influence of the interatomic interaction potential .",
    "the scattering length is only well - defined for zero - energy scattering and thus the underlying concept is in principle not applicable to trapped particles with a non - vanishing zero - point energy .",
    "therefore , the scattering - length values ( for a given inner - wall shift ) are determined for the trap - free situation . in this case",
    "@xmath82 can be uniquely determined from the analysis of the shape of the zero - energy scattering wave function  @xcite .",
    "direction ( @xmath83 ) for a system of two _ identical _ atoms if one of them is positioned at the zero of @xmath84 .",
    "the upper graph shows the @xmath85 potential together with the harmonic ( green ) and sextic ( red ) approximations .",
    "while the harmonic and sextic potentials support solely bound states , the energy spectrum of the @xmath85 potential is partly discrete ( for a sufficiently deep value of @xmath86 ) and partly continuous .",
    "the lower graph shows the range of small @xmath84 values on an enlarged scale .",
    "a very tiny variation of the inner wall of the interaction potential leads to a relatively large shift of the least bound and the first trap - induced states .",
    ", width=283,height=226 ]    ignoring the formal problems of defining a scattering length within a trap ( that will be discussed in some more detail below ) , it is often considered useful to introduce a dimension - free interaction parameter @xmath87 that reflects the relative magnitude of the interaction strength with respect to the confinement by the trap . if this confinement is approximated within the harmonic approximation , the interaction parameter is naturally defined as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the characteristic length of a harmonic potential given by @xmath90 . for a heteronuclear atom pair",
    "@xmath91 is again the mean harmonic frequency defined in eq.([eq : omegaheteronuc ] ) .",
    "experimentally , a strong variation of the interaction strength can be realized with the help of magnetic feshbach resonances  ( mfr )  @xcite .",
    "the mfr technique was also used to tune the interatomic interaction from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive in the already mentioned experiments with atoms in the optical lattices  @xcite . in general ,",
    "the correct theoretical description of a mfr requires a multi - channel scattering treatment which in the present case would have to incorporate also the optical lattice . in the analysis of the experiments described in  @xcite it is",
    ", however , assumed that it is possible to model the mfr in an effective two - channel picture  @xcite . within this model",
    "it is straightforward to relate the applied magnetic field to a scattering - length value ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : twochan ] ) below ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonians @xmath92 and @xmath93 are obtained by expressing both @xmath26 and @xmath27 as a linear combination of products of radial @xmath94-spline functions times spherical harmonics .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equations are solved numerically using the rayleigh - ritz - galerkin approach  @xcite which leads to an algebraic eigenproblem .",
    "in general , the lattice leads to a coupling of the angular momenta .",
    "therefore , the spherical harmonics are no eigensolutions of the angular part . due to the cubic trap geometry used in the experiment in  @xcite and also for the present calculations ,",
    "the coupling of different spherical harmonics is weak .",
    "in fact , the orbitals @xmath26 and @xmath27 describing the states relevant to this work are almost converged , even if only @xmath95 is considered . however , the coupling term @xmath96 in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : fullham ] ) leads to a stronger angular momentum coupling .",
    "good convergence was found in the ci calculation , if all spherical harmonics up to @xmath97 ( and thus also @xmath98 ) were included in the calculation of the orbitals @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the required number of @xmath94 splines and their knot sequence depend strongly on the behavior of the wave function ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) that should be described . in the context of ultracold collisions the main interest is put on the energetically low - lying com orbitals @xmath26 that possess a small number of nodes . for the results discussed in this work",
    ", about 70 @xmath94 splines were found to be sufficient to obtain convergence . evidently , more complicated or highly anisotropic trap geometries ( like double or triple wells @xcite ) require larger expansions",
    ".    the numerical description of the rel orbitals @xmath27 is more demanding , if one is interested in the most weakly bound states or the low - lying dissociative states . the bo curves of alkali - metal atom dimers support often a large number of bound states ( for example , the @xmath2rb-@xmath1k system possesses in the @xmath99 state already 32 bound states for @xmath95 ) .",
    "the very long - ranged , weakly bound states consist therefore of a highly oscillatory inner part ( covering the so - called molecular regime and providing the orthogonality to all lower lying bound states ) and a rather smooth long - range part .",
    "correspondingly , it is practical to use two different knot sequences for the @xmath94 splines . in the present case convergence",
    "was found if 200 @xmath94 splines expanded on a linear knot sequence covering the interval @xmath100 are used together with about 70 @xmath94 splines for the remaining @xmath101 range .",
    "the latter 70 @xmath94 splines are expanded on a knot sequence in which the separation between the knot points increases in a geometric fashion",
    ".    converged ci calculations were found , if they comprised configurations built from about 120 rel and 60 com orbitals . after taking symmetry into account",
    "this amounts to about 1060 configurations forming the ci expansion for the states of interest in this work .",
    "the description of an optical lattice beyond the harmonic approximation is in the present work achieved by extending the taylor expansion of the @xmath85 potential beyond the harmonic ( 1st order and thus quadratic ) term . in principle",
    ", one should seek for convergence with respect to the expansion length , but there are some practical reasons why a simple convergence study as a function of the expansion length causes problems .",
    "first of all , even - order expansions like the 2nd order one which leads to polynomials with a degree of up to 4 ( quartic potential ) support an infinite number of bound states with negative energy , since they tend to @xmath102 for @xmath84 approaching either @xmath103 or @xmath102 .",
    "however , these bound states with negative energies are unphysical , since they do not exist in the case of the ( original ) positive definite @xmath85 potential .",
    "the 3rd order expansion that leads to polynomials up to a degree of 6 ( sextic potential ) supports on the other hand ( like all odd - order expansions ) only bound states with positive energy values .",
    "a comparison of this sextic potential with the @xmath85 potentials shows that the sextic potential reproduces extremely well a single site of the @xmath85 potential and thus of the optical lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "therefore , the sextic potential is a good choice for the investigation of the effects of anharmonicity on the bound states in a single site of an optical lattice .",
    "evidently , the sextic potential can not reproduce effects that are due to tunneling between neighbor potential wells .",
    "therefore , extended ( energetically higher lying ) bound states in the optical lattice that are markedly affected by tunneling are not well reproduced by a sextic potential .",
    "noteworthy , even in this case a simple convergence study will , however , not work .",
    "for example , the 5th order and thus next odd - order expansion shows a triple - well structure , but the two outer wells have a depth and width that differs pronouncedly from the correct shape ( and the central well ) .",
    "this leads to completely wrongly described states in these outer wells and may thus show wrong tunneling behavior for the states in the middle well , especially in the case of resonant tunneling .",
    "since the present study concentrates on the anharmonicity effects within a single site of an optical lattice , only the sextic potential and , for comparison , the harmonic one are considered .",
    "effects that are due to tunneling between neighbor wells and thus include more than single - well potentials are investigated in a separate work  @xcite .",
    "the potential seen by the two atoms in an optical lattice contains , of course , in addition to the trap potential also the interatomic interaction potential that in the present case is described by a born - oppenheimer potential curve ( and appears only in the rel coordinates ) . as is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , the interatomic interaction dominates the short - range part of the potential and leads in the case of alkali - metal atoms to a large number of bound molecular states .",
    "since the trap potential is compared to the variation of the bo curve almost constant in the range of the molecular bound states , especially the lower lying of these states will in practice not be influenced by the optical lattice .",
    "the largest possible effect of the optical lattice on the molecular bound states is expected to occur for the energetically highest lying one , the least bound ( lb ) state .    due to the large spatial extension of the trap states of typical",
    "experimentally realized optical lattices these trap - induced states are expected to be only weakly influenced by the molecular potential . however , an immediate consequence of the existence of the molecular bound states below the trap - induced ones is the nodal structure at short distances that is imprinted on the wavefunctions and leads to the required orthogonality of the eigenstates .",
    "the energetically lowest lying and thus first trap - induced ( 1ti ) state possesses thus exactly one more node than the lb state . in the experiments most closely related to the present work @xcite the transition energy between the lb and",
    "the 1ti state has been measured by either rf dissociation or association , respectively .",
    "this transition energy was called binding energy , but it should be kept in mind that its definition does not coincide with the standard definition of a molecular binding energy which is given by the energy difference between a molecular bound state and the ( lowest ) dissociation limit . in the present case",
    "the existence of the optical lattice leads to a discretization of the dissociation continuum and thus to an additional energy shift due to the zero - point energy of the trap .",
    "if the coupling @xmath22 of rel and com coordinates is ignored , the energies @xmath104 and @xmath105 of the least bound and the 1st trap - induced state , respectively , are obtained from the eigenvalues of eq.([eq : comrelschroed ] ) as @xmath106 where @xmath107 specifies the expansion length describing the optical lattice : @xmath108 for a harmonic and @xmath109 for a sextic trap . in accordance with the underlying assumption of an ultracold gas ,",
    "the system is assumed to be in its lowest state with respect to translational motion , i.e.  in the com ground state with energy @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding wavefunctions are given by @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    "the state @xmath30 with a dominant contribution from @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) is then identified as least bound ( 1st - trap - induced ) state with energy @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , where @xmath107 stands again for the order of the taylor expansion of the optical - lattice potential .    in fig .",

    "although this state is at least in the strongly repulsive part of the spectrum long ranged , it `` feels '' the anharmonic form of the trapping potential very weakly .",
    "this state remains thus sufficiently deeply localized in the trap potential and the harmonic approximation works still reasonably well ; even for the rather strong repulsive interaction expressed by the scattering length @xmath128 .",
    "the energy change of the first trap - induced state due to the anharmonicity and rel - com coupling is on the other hand much more pronounced .",
    "this change is thus predominantly defining the modification of the binding energy due to the trap .",

    "independent of the scattering length and thus the interaction strength as well as its type ( repulsive or attractive ) the uncoupled harmonic energy @xmath125 is lowered , if the com - rel coupling is included ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "note , this coupling exists even within the harmonic approximation for a heteronuclear diatomic molecule like rbk , since the two atoms possess different masses and polarizabilities and experience therefore different trap potentials . as a consequence , com and rel motions do not separate . only for diatomic systems made from two atoms in the same electronic state ( or in some accidental situation )",
    "this coupling of com and rel motion vanishes within the harmonic approximation .",
    "an even larger reduction of the energy is observed , if only the anharmonicity is considered as is reflected by @xmath124 in which the coupling of com and rel motion is ignored . for the considered system",
    "the effect of anharmonicity is thus a larger correction to the separable harmonic approximation than the one caused by the coupling of com and rel motion .",
    "a further energy reduction is found , if both effects are considered which leads to @xmath122 .",
    "interestingly , the energy reduction indicated by @xmath122 is larger than the sum of the energy reductions obtained separately for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",

    "the authors in  @xcite proposed that with the aid of the calculation it is in fact possible to improve on the mfr parameters .",
    "such a fit ( with the energy - independent scattering length ) yielded the new resonance parameters @xmath139  g and @xmath140  g  @xcite .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the present fit that yields the new resonance position @xmath137  g but an unchanged width ( @xmath138  g ) , as was discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : manofinin ] .",
    "thus there is a similar ( though slightly larger ) trend for @xmath143 , but disagreement with the results in  @xcite with respect to @xmath144 .    in view of the different fit results ,",
    "it is important to investigate in more detail their sensitivity on the fit parameters .",
    "the quality of the fit depends on the agreement between the calculated binding energy ( @xmath145 ) and the experimental one ( @xmath146 ) .",

    "[ fig : riprmcim ] , any variation of either @xmath144 or @xmath143 from their optimal values results in an increased error for all energy branches and all magnetic fields .",
    "clearly , the fit shows a well defined minimum and thus there is no ambiguity in the fit parameters as it could occur , e.g. , in the case of very shallow minima where the outcome of the fit may be determined by small numerical inaccuracies .",
    "provided the fit fidelity in  @xcite is comparable to the present one , i.e. , a fit with the binding energies calculated in  @xcite using the optimal fit parameters of the present work would disagree with the experiment in a similarly pronounced fashion as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : riprmcim ] , it is presently impossible to conclude whether theory has already reached the level of accuracy that is required for an improved determination of mfr parameters . while both fits appear to indicate a smaller value of @xmath143 compared to the one previously extracted from experiment , the deviation between both fits is only about half as small as the improvement claimed in  @xcite .",
    "clearly , such a result is from a statistical point of view inconclusive . in the case of the width @xmath144",
    "the present finding agrees even fully to the previously determined value and thus disagrees with the result of the fit in  @xcite .    in order to obtain a more conclusive result",
    "it is vital to investigate whether the differences between the results in  @xcite and the present ones are solely due to the use of the pseudopotential approximation or the more realistic interatomic interaction potential in the two studies .",
    "if this were the case , the fit results of the present study should be regarded as the more accurate ones .",
    "furthermore , this would be an important example for the need to consider the interatomic interaction on a more accurate level than the one provided by the pseudopotential approximation .",
    "since the implementation of the pseudopotential is due to the singular behavior of the @xmath0 function non - trivial in the context of the present approach , such an investigation has to be postponed to a separate work .",
    "clearly , more experimental data ( for different heteronuclear systems ) would also be very important for gaining a deeper insight and it is hoped that the present work stimulates such experimental activities .    finally , there are two further uncertainties in the determination of the mfr parameters from a fit like the one in  @xcite or in the present work .",
    "they are related to the way in which the mapping of the theoretical data onto the magnetic field is performed .",
    "as already mentioned , this mapping is usually based on the assumption of validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : twochaninv ] ) and thus on the assumption that the @xmath94-field mapping of the multichannel mfr can be performed based solely on a scattering - length variation . even in this case",
    "there is , however , the problem of the proper determination of the energy - dependent scattering length in an optical lattice which is so far unknown . the use of @xmath149 extracted from the harmonic uncoupled energies for the mapping of the the full sextic energy results effectively in a shift of the energy - independent curve , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfield ] .",
    "however , both the energy - dependent and energy - independent @xmath82 discussed in this work utilize the same harmonic energy curve ignoring also the coupling to the com motion .",
    "how the situation would change , if @xmath149 for a non - harmonic solution would be used , is difficult to predict , since the other curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbk_27_40 ] not only differ in shape , but are also shifted relative to each other and contain the com part .",
    "the overall good agreement of the theoretical binding energies ( with fitted mfr parameters ) to the experimental data is of course very suggestive that these uncertainties have a small influence , but this may be a pure coincidence .    both , the investigation of the appropriateness of the @xmath94-field mapping as well as the question of the possibility to define an energy - dependent scattering length beyond the uncoupled harmonic approximation require a theoretical approach for the treatment of two atoms in an optical lattice as the one presented in this work and is presently pursued .",
    "it should , however , be emphasized that these uncertainties only affect the analysis of dimers close to a ( magnetic ) feshbach resonance or , in general , if the proper description of the atom - pair requires a multi - channel treatment .",
    "the results of the previous sections are valid independently of these uncertainties .",
    "different interaction regimes are experimentally accessible within the validity regime of a single - potential - curve treatment even for the same dimer by considering different isotopes or electronic states .",
    "the simplicity of experimental tunability as is found for magnetic feshbach resonances is then of course lost .",
    "an approach which allows for a full numerical description of two ultracold atoms in 3d optical lattice is developed .",
    "a detailed analysis of anharmonicity and coupling of center - of - mass and relative coordinates in terms of energy values and wave functions was performed for heteronuclear dimers in a single site of an optical lattice .",
    "it is explained , why such a single site is optimally described by a sextic potential , if a finite taylor expansion is used .",
    "the effects of deviations from the harmonic approximation and of the coupling were quantified and analyzed for different heteronuclear systems , confinement strengths and interatomic interaction regimes .",
    "the influence of the lattice is found to be always much stronger for the first trap - induced state than for the least bound state . as a consequence ,",
    "binding energies are modified by the lattice mainly by the modification of the first trap - induced state .    while the energy deviations from the harmonic uncoupled approximation is for all three considered generic heteronuclear dimers largest for strong repulsive interaction , the relative size ( and even sign ) of the energy change due to coupling or anharmonicity varies for the different dimers .",
    "the same is true for the the influence of the trap depth .",
    "a deeper lattice can lead to smaller or larger energy differences between the harmonic uncoupled or the full coupled solution . while the analysis of the radial pair densities shows that the lattice mainly influences the maxima located at large interatomic separations , the analysis of cuts through the wave functions in absolute coordinates reveals non - negligible changes also at short interatomic distances .",
    "this may have important consequences for the validity of pseudopotential approximations .",
    "the results of the present theoretical approach are also compared to a recent experiment in which the binding energies of @xmath2rb-@xmath1k have been measured as a function of an external magnetic field tuned close to a magnetic feshbach resonance .",
    "the assumptions necessary for such a comparison are carefully discussed .",
    "it is found that very good agreement between experiment and theory can only be reached , if the previously experimentally determined resonance parameters are modified . since",
    "this needed modification is within the error bars with which the parameters had been determined before , this is not only reasonable , but may even indicate the possibility to more accurately determine the width and position of magnetic feshbach resonances in ultracold atomic gases , as was proposed recently in a comparable theoretical study .",
    "however , the resonance parameters determined in the previous study based on the pseudopotential approximation differ from the ones found in the present work .",
    "if this deviation is due to the pseudopotential approximation is difficult to judge at this moment .",
    "if this were the case , the then found breakdown of the pseudopotential approximation would , of course , be a very interesting finding .",
    "a further investigation is therefore of great interest , and the present work stimulates hopefully also further experimental work in this direction . since the influence of anharmonicity and coupling becomes more important for less deep optical lattices and for excited trap levels corresponding experiments like the ones in @xcite",
    "are expected to provide further tests of the approach presented in this work .",
    "since the present approach was rather generally formulated and implemented , it allows immediately for further investigations that have partly been started or are planned for the future .",
    "this includes the consideration of highly anisotropic , asymmetric ( disordered ) , or multiple - well lattice geometries .",
    "first results for triple - well potentials have , e.g. , recently been used for the determination of bose - hubbard parameters and an investigation of the validity of the bose - hubbard model itself  @xcite . the study of an interesting physical phenomena like , e.g. , the trap - induced resonances  @xcite are also planned .",
    "further extensions of the approach should also allow to study the case of a pair of atoms or molecules interacting by non - centric , e.g. , dipolar interactions .",
    "finally , it is planned to extend the method for studies of the time - dependent dynamics of atomic pairs in time - varying lattices .",
