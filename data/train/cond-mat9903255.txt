    "the study of cooperative phenomena in optics was initiated by the pioneering work of dicke.@xcite the underlying physics of the cooperative emission can be readily understood using a classical approach .",

    "the intensities ratio of these bands is determined by the details of the excitation .",
    "this type of lifetimes redistribution is caused by the interactions among the oscillators through their radiation fields .",
    "certainly , the classical picture does not describe all aspects of the cooperative emission .",
    "in fact , the original work of dicke@xcite primarily addressed the time evolution of the radiation emission , provided that at the initial moment , @xmath15 , all the oscillators are coherently excited .",
    "for this situation , the classical picture helps in understanding that the radiation is released during a short time , @xmath16 ; understanding of the initial stages of the emission process ( the delay time statistics ) requires , however , a quantum description.@xcite the original treatment in ref . also ignored the dipole ",
    "dipole interactions , which give rise to a spread in the oscillators frequencies ( dephasing ) .",
    "the question whether or not this dephasing would completely destroy the cooperative emission is very non  trivial and was addressed in a number of later works.@xcite    in the previous considerations of cooperative emission , it was assumed that all @xmath7 oscillators ( atoms , molecules or excitons ) have the same frequencies .",
    "such a restriction was adequate for the experimental situation in both gases and single crystals .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only account of disorder in the frequencies of the oscillators was given in ref .",
    ", which addressed the transient behavior of the cooperative emission from molecular aggregates .",
    "the case of @xmath17aggregates corresponds to a symmetrical arrangement of oscillators in a circle .",
    "the authors@xcite treated the disorder within the perturbation theory and averaged the second  order correction to the decay rates ( the first ",
    "order correction vanishes upon averaging ) with a gaussian distribution .",
    "the advantage of the work in ref .",
    "is that the nearest neighbors dipole ",
    "dipole interactions were taken into account exactly .",
    "the drawback is in the perturbative approach , which rules out certain @xmath18 physical effects ( see below ) .    whereas ref .",
    "addressed a rather particular situation , the following _ general _ questions might be asked .",
    "suppose that the oscillators frequencies are randomly distributed with a characteristic width @xmath8 .",
    "obviously , as @xmath8 increases , it would eventually destroy the cooperative features in the emission spectrum .",
    "then what is the critical magnitude of @xmath8 ?",
    "how does this magnitude depend on the parameters of the system @xmath7 , @xmath1 , and @xmath9 ?",
    "what is the structure of the emission spectrum when disorder is smaller than critical ?",
    "these questions have become not purely academic due to the recent advances in the field of laser  action in @xmath19conjugated polymers.@xcite some experiments provide a strong evidence for cooperative emission from an ensemble of excitons in these materials , for excitation intensities exceeding a certain characteristic threshold.@xcite on the other hand , it is well known that the films of @xmath19-conjugated polymers are strongly disordered@xcite ( in the absense of disorder , cooperative emission by polymer chain was considered in ref . ) .",
    "they contain impurities and defects which break the polymer chains into segments of relatively short conjugation length , with a distribution depending on the film quality.@xcite this has a direct effect on the exciton energy , @xmath20 , since it has been found that @xmath20 directly depends on the chain conjugation length.@xcite    the questions formulated above are addressed in the present paper .",
    "we study here the effect of disorder on the cooperative emission spectrum of the system of classical oscillators .",
    "we consider the situation of incoherent excitation , which is most relevant to the experiment.@xcite in contrast to ref .",
    ", we are interested in the nonaveraged ( but universal ) properties of the emission spectrum . in other words ,",
    "our goal is to assess the @xmath21@xcite aspects of the cooperative emission . by mesoscopic",
    "we mean that , in the presence of a disorder , the emission spectrum of a large number of oscillators develops a fine structure .",
    "the actual shape of this spectral structure represents the _ fingerprints _ of the distribution of the oscillator frequencies and positions for a given realization . at the same time , the characteristic period and amplitude of the fine structure are determined by the net parameters of the system : @xmath7 , @xmath1 , and @xmath8 .",

    "this occurs when the value of @xmath213 exceeds the mfs , @xmath164 , which is inconsistent with the above analysis .",
    "the reason for such a discrepancy is that for large @xmath7 , the model with coupling @xmath91 independent of separation between oscillators , becomes inadequate , as we mentioned above .",
    "for the correct description of the peaks smearing at large @xmath7 , the spatial dependence of @xmath91 is crucial ; this question is addressed in section   [ scaling ] .",

    "since the typical spatial separation between two oscillators with close frequencies is @xmath219 , the separation fluctuations are of the same order .",

    "( [ kappa ] ) , the width ( [ lastwidth ] ) can be expressed in terms of the mfs as @xmath229 this result applies when @xmath230 . on the other hand , it was implicit in the above derivation ( section   [ structure ] ) that typical @xmath231 and @xmath196 are smaller than unity .",
    "the latter parameters can be estimated in a similar way from eqs .",
    "( [ imsigsys1 ] )  and   ( [ resigsys1 ] ) with the result : @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",

    "all terms in eqs .",
    "( [ resys1])([resigsys1 ] ) become of the same order of magnitude , and for smaller @xmath226 this system has no _ subradiant _ solutions , as discussed above .",
    "since the mfs exceeds the width @xmath122 within the entire domain @xmath236 , the fine structure in the spectral intensity @xmath56 is well pronounced . in other words , this domain corresponds to the strong mesoscopics regime .",
    "the opposite case @xmath237 is considered in the next section .",
    "in the domain @xmath238 , the system can not sustain eigenmodes that involve all @xmath7 oscillators . as a result ,",
    "the eigenmodes become localized , in the sense that each eigenmode would comprise some @xmath239 oscillators and occupy the volume with characteristic size @xmath240 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath241 and @xmath242 can be estimated from the following argument .",
    "let us divide the system of oscillators into subsystems of increasingly smaller size .",
    "when the size of the subsystem becomes @xmath243 , the system of equations ( [ resys1 ] )  and   ( [ imsys1 ] ) , _ applied _ _ to _ _ a _ _ subsystem _ , first acquires a solution .",

    "in this section we study the effect of dipole - dipole interactions on the cooperative emission from a disordered system .",
    "note that for a `` point '' sample with @xmath250 , the typical magnitude of the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction between two oscillators is much larger than their superradiant coupling , @xmath251 . the structure of the eigenmodes in the absence of superradiant coupling , given by eq .",
    "( [ lastsys ] ) with @xmath184 , was considered in several papers.@xcite renormalization  group arguments of ref .",
    "( see also ref . )",
    "suggest that all eigenmodes are delocalized .",
    "numerical studies@xcite indicate a wide range of spatial scales in eigenmodes and , thus , seem to support this conclusion . in ref .",
    ", the role of general random - matrix perturbation in the spectrum of multilevel system was studied analytically ; he ensemble - averaged renormalization of the spectrum of the system was derived which does not capture , however , the mesoscopic effects .",
    "below we argue that finite disorder in combination with superradiant coupling lead to a certain `` resistance '' of the system to large , but zero on average , dipole ",
    "dipole terms because of the formation of cooperative modes .    in the absence of superradiant coupling ( @xmath184 ) the dipole ",
    "dipole interactions lead to the shifts in the frequencies of individual oscillators .",
    "the resulting additional spread in @xmath23 is , in general , much larger than the `` bare '' spread @xmath8 .",
    "this can be readily seen from the lowest  order correction to the frequency , @xmath252 , which has the form    @xmath253    ( since @xmath254 , the lowest  order correction to @xmath23 is quadratic ) .",
    "the main contribution to the sum comes from pairs of oscillators located closely in space , with @xmath255 ( nearest neighbor interaction ) , so that    @xmath256    since the typical frequency difference for such pairs is @xmath257 , we obtain @xmath258 on the other hand , the results obtained in the previous sections apply only if the additional disorder , caused by dipole  dipole interactions , does not affect the mfs .",
    "this requires the condition @xmath259 to be met . using eq .",
    "( [ oscshift1 ] ) , this condition could be rewritten as @xmath260 .",
    "since the formation of cooperative modes occurs only if @xmath176 , one could draw the conclusion that neglecting the dipole ",
    "dipole interactions would be inconsistent with our basic assumption @xmath250 .",
    "the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies in the observation that , in the presence of superradiant coupling , i.e. @xmath187 , the true eigenmodes of the system are cooperative modes comprised from a large number of oscillators .",
    "therefore , the relevant condition should involve the shifts , @xmath261 , of the _ eigenmodes frequencies _",
    ", rather than @xmath252 .",
    "in the first order , @xmath261 is given by an expression similar to the second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ width1 ] ) [ with @xmath90 instead of @xmath150 ] . since this term _ vanishes _ on average , as discussed above , the typical shift , @xmath262 , can be estimated from [ compare with eq .",
    "( [ fluct ] ) ] @xmath263 there are two main contributions to the sum in the rhs .",
    "the first comes from the nearest ",
    "neighbor interaction with @xmath90 given by eq .",
    "( [ nearest ] ) .",
    "the second contribution originates from the pairs ( @xmath264 ) which are close in frequency ; for such pairs , @xmath265 .",
    "both contributions turn out to be of the _ same _ order of magnitude , resulting in @xmath266 this result is smaller than @xmath252 in eq .",
    "( [ oscshift1 ] ) by the factor @xmath267 .",
    "such a dramatic difference illustrates the `` resistance '' of a coupled system of oscillators with disorder in frequencies to dipole ",
    "dipole interactions , as mentioned above .",
    "this property can also be qualitatively explained as follows .",
    "the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction between two subradiant modes can be viewed as an interaction between a mode and the electric field , @xmath268 , created by the dipole moments of oscillators making up the other mode . since the number of oscillators in a mode is large",
    ", their electric fields effectively cancel each other , so that the resulting net field , @xmath268 , varies in space _ much slower _ than those of the individual oscillators .",
    "note now that a slowly varying electric field couples only weakly to a _ subradiant _ mode .",
    "in fact , the suppression of the dipole  dipole interaction between subradiant modes has the same physical origin as their decoupling from the radiation field : had the electric field @xmath269 been uniform , the cooperative modes would not interact at all with each other .",
    "this is the reason why the corrections to @xmath168 and @xmath171 vanish _ on average _ , and consequently the typical @xmath270 and @xmath122 are determined by the _ fluctuations _ of @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , the frequency shifts of individual oscillators are due to their interactions with the nearest neighbors , so that no cancellations occur .",
    "thus we arrive at the condition @xmath271 , or , in terms of the parameter @xmath226 , @xmath272 this condition should be consistent with the condition for the formation of the cooperative modes , @xmath273 .",
    "we see that both conditions are satisfied for sufficiently large @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath274 . to account for different mesoscopics regimes , it is convenient to present eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) in the form @xmath275 then @xmath276 ,  4 ,  and  5 correspond to the `` point '' sample , strong mesoscopics , and weak mesoscopics regimes , respectively .",
    "the main result of the present paper is that disorder in oscillators frequencies does not destroy the cooperative character of the emission from a `` point '' sample , as long as the mfs , @xmath164 , is smaller than the linewidth of an individual oscillator , @xmath277 . in the opposite case ,",
    "when @xmath278 , the spectrum represents a system of non  overlapping lorentzians with the width @xmath277 .",
    "it is convenient to characterize the disorder in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath279 .",
    "below we summarize our results for the characteristic width , @xmath122 , of the subradiant peaks ( in units of @xmath164 ) for different domains of @xmath226 : @xmath280 where the dimensionless function @xmath281 has the following asymptotes @xmath282 for @xmath283 , the spectrum corresponds to uncoupled oscillators .    in section  [ simple ] , we presented an exact solution of a model with simplified ( separable ) coupling eq .",
    "( [ separab ] ) .",
    "this model describes accurately the first two ( `` point '' sample and strong mesoscopics ) regimes in eq .",
    "( [ asymptotes ] ) .",
    "it becomes , however , inadequate in the third ( weak mesoscopics ) regime , giving a @xmath284 instead of the correct @xmath285 dependence for the period of mesoscopic structure in the cooperative emission spectrum .    throughout the paper",
    "we have considered a three - dimensional system of oscillators . when the oscillators are confined to a plane , only the results for @xmath286 should be modified . in this case , repeating the consideration of section  [ scaling ] , we obtain @xmath287 . also for the relative magnitude of mesoscopic fluctuations , @xmath288 , instead of eq .",
    "( [ decreasing ] ) we obtain @xmath289 .",
    "note finally that in experiments , such as photoexcited excitons in polymer films , the number of oscillators @xmath7 is governed by the excitation intensity.@xcite thus , for a given disorder , the crossover from the strong mesoscopics regime ( @xmath290 ) to the weak mesoscopics regime ( @xmath291 ) can be simply achieved by increasing the excitation intensity level.@xcite    the authors are grateful to s. mukamel and m. i. stockman for helpful discussions .",
