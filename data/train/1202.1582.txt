    "in standard cosmology , the copernican principle is applied i.e. , it is assumed that we are not living at a privileged position in the universe . combining the copernican principle with the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , leads to the conclusion that our universe is well described by the homogeneous and isotropic universe model . in the framework of the homogeneous and isotropic universe ,",
    "the observational data of the luminosity distances of type ia supernovae ( snia ) indicates an acceleration of the cosmic volume expansion of our universe .",
    "the acceleration of the cosmic volume expansion in the homogeneous and isotropic universe implies the existence of so - called dark energy that acts as a source of a repulsive gravitational force if we assume general relativity at cosmological scales . at present",
    ", there is no theory that can naturally explain the origin of dark energy , and it seems worth investigating alternative scenarios . in order to do this",
    ", we have to discard general relativity or the homogeneity assumption .",
    "inhomogeneous cosmological models without dark energy have been proposed independently by tomita  @xcite and clrier  @xcite . in clrier s model",
    ", the observer is located at the symmetry center of a very large spherical void which can explain the snia observations .",
    "since the observer is located at a special position in the universe , we call this model a  the non - copernican universe model \" in this paper . the common assumption of non - copernican universe models is that an observer is located in the vicinity of the symmetry center , which explains the fact that the cmb radiation is observed to be isotropic .",
    "the most common way to describe non - copernican universe models is to use the lematre - tolman - bondi(ltb ) solution for the einstein equations , which describes the motion of spherically symmetric dust .",
    "snia observations in non - copernican universe models have been studied by many researchers  @xcite , and it has been proven that the distance - redshift relation in the @xmath3cdm universe can be reproduced using ltb universe models  @xcite .",
    "non - copernican universe models have been tested by other observations including the cmb acoustic peaks  @xcite , the radial baryon acoustic oscillation scales  @xcite , the kinematic suniyaev - zeldovich effect  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "although these observations have imposed restrictions on these models , they have not yet ruled out the models .",
    "it is not easy to confirm whether our universe follows the copernican principle .    in this paper , we focus on the evolution of structures such as clusters of galaxies and super - clusters in the non - copernican universe in the matter dominant era which is well described by the ltb solution .",
    "it is expected that observations of the large - scale structures and their evolution can be used to test the non - copernican universe model , since the evolution of the anisotropic perturbations reflects the tidal force in the background spacetime .",
    "however , the evolution of perturbations in the ltb solution has not yet been fully studied .",
    "this is because the isometries in the ltb spacetime are less than in the homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "although master equations for perturbations for general spherically symmetric spacetimes have been derived a long time ago  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the ltb background ) , these equations for the ltb solution can not be reduced to ordinary differential equations , in general .",
    "this is a very different situation from the case of the homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "recently , alonso et al .  @xcite performed numerical simulations for non - copernican models including only cold dark matter .",
    "they studied the perturbed einstein - desitter universe with two kinds of perturbations : one forms a spherical void , and the other is a non - spherical perturbation with a power spectrum with a random phase gaussian probability distribution .",
    "they followed the growth of these perturbations using newtonian @xmath4-body simulations .",
    "however , in order to confirm the validity of the tnumerical simulations , analytic complementary studies are necessary .",
    "some authors  @xcite have studied perturbations by using a `` silent approximation '' that neglects the magnetic part of the weyl tensor . here",
    ", we should note that the magnetic part of the weyl tensor usually plays an important role even in newtonian situations  @xcite .",
    "hence , in this paper , we propose another complementary analytic approach .    in many non - copernican models ,",
    "the void structure becomes nonlinear at the present time .",
    "however , enqvist et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the void inhomogeneity remains in a quasi - linear regime @xmath5 inside a past light - cone of an observer at the center of the void .",
    "actually , they considered a linear perturbation in the einstein - desitter universe that is consistent with the snia data , and showed that the fraction of the spherically symmetric linear perturbation does not exceed 30% inside the past light - cone .",
    "this result implies that non - copernican ltb cosmological models compatible with the observed distance - redshift relation may be studied by perturbation theory for the homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with dust at least for the inside of the past light - cone of the central observer .    in this paper , we investigate the growth of perturbations in the non - copernican universe models by applying the above idea .",
    "it is rather difficult to analyze the evolution of anisotropic perturbations in the non - copernican ltb universe model , while it is much easier to study the evolution of non - linear perturbations in the homogeneous and isotropic universe model by successive approximation .",
    "we adopt the latter approach .",
