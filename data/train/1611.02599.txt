    "the greatest similarity with the ceag@xmath28 spectrum is given in case of weakest hybridization , i.e.  for @xmath32  u.c .",
    "the detailed analysis of the xa line shape @xcite reveals that the main contribution to its variation is an increasingly asymmetric response of the individual resonances as the hybridization is increased .",

    "the simulation for @xmath33 u.c . uses symmetric lorentzians ( @xmath35 ev ) to represent the lifetime of the core hole excitation , while asymmetric ones ( see inset ) are employed for @xmath36 u.c .",
    "the pronounced asymmetric spectral response causes the ( apparent ) reduction of the spectral weight of feature a vs.  feature b , at the same time the falling edge of the m@xmath0 absorption is significantly broadened .",
    "the strength of asymmetry in the spectral response correlates directly with the @xmath37 spectral weight @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume that it is a manifestation of an increasingly efficient coupling to low energy excitations in the metallic bands with which the @xmath4 states hybridize and as such related to the edge singularity problem ( see e.g. refs .   and references therein ) .",

    "( c ) calculated effect of the asymmetric response on xa and xld line shapes and magnitudes .",
    "note that relative to the xa strength , the xld is most strongly reduced at feature b. ]    nevertheless , the redistribution of spectral weight towards higher excitation energies not only affects the spectral appearance of the xa spectra but also modifies the spectral shape of xld .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2xasxld](c ) , where we plot simulated xld spectra with the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig2xasxld](b ) along with their isotropic xa counterparts . while the peaks of both xa and xld spectra are reduced in intensity",
    ", we note that the ratios between the magnitudes of xld and xa are affected in different ways for the main spectral features . in particular , while the loss of peak intensity of feature b in xa is partly compensated for by transfer of spectral weight from feature a , the same spectral weight transfer additionally reduces the xld of feature b owing to the sign change in xld between features a and b. overall , the observation of an asymmetric spectral response leads us to expect a systematic decrease of the relative xld amplitude as the hybridization is increased .",
    "experimentally , we shall find this expectation confirmed ( see below ) , but the magnitude of xld is even suppressed well beyond the level to be expected by the modified @xmath43 xa line shape .",
    "similar findings have been reported before and have been suggested to result from hybridization viz .",
    "the kondo interaction @xcite . within the non - crossing approximation @xcite ( nca ) to the impurity problem this",
    "may qualitatively be rationalized as follows .",
    "we represent the many body state as a superposition of states with @xmath37 and @xmath43 character    @xmath44    in the absence of excited state mixing , the squared coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 directly correspond to the relative spectral weights of the @xmath37 and @xmath43 related fractions of the xa spectra @xcite . in a second step we rewrite the @xmath43 part as a superposition of the six @xmath47 states of the ce @xmath4 @xmath48 multiplet . in the nca treatment , each of these states is represented by the resonance of a temperature dependent many body spectral function .",
    "resonance positions are given by the cf scheme and zeeman energies , and they acquire finite width through hybridization .",
    "the statistical weight of each level is obtained by integration over these spectral functions . in particular , due to the hybridization induced width the excited states possess higher occupation probabilities at low temperature than what would be obtained from ordinary statistics of discrete cf states . as a result",
    ", the magnitude of xld is reduced .    just as the xld , the magnetic response",
    "is mainly governed by the occupation of the cf states .",
    "zwicknagl et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a simplified nca scheme which is particularly suited to treat cf splitting and mean field coupling at the same level as the many body kondo physics .",
    "the characteristic failure of the standard nca at low temperature is circumvented in this approach by omission of the divergent term in the spectral function of the @xmath49 state .",
    "the application of this scheme does not yield a satisfactory description of our experimental results though : imposing a kondo scale of order @xmath19 k in accordance with the observed ce @xmath4 occupation @xmath50@xcite leads to a much stronger supression of the low temperature magnetic response than we observe .",
    "conversely , assuming a small effective kondo scale ( @xmath51 ) in the nca , one computes much too large a susceptibility at higher temperatures compared with the experimental data .",
    "we therefore reckon that it is the occurrence of two distinct energy scales which prevents the applicability of the nca scheme in case of cept@xmath0/pt(111 ) .",

    "we represent the possibility of non - thermal cf state occupation by introducing an ` isotropic fraction ' of weight @xmath53 in the normal incidence ( ni ) spectra , where for simplicity we assume this fraction to be temperature independent and the same in the three kramers doublets .",
    "the model equation for the temperature dependence of ni spectra ( @xmath43 part only ) thus reads as follows :    @xmath54    here , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the boltzmann weights representing the thermal excitation probabilities according to the cf splittings @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the standard partition function @xmath59 being given by @xmath60 , @xmath61 is constructed such as to take the isotropic fraction into account , i.e. @xmath62 .    figure  [ fig3xld11uc](a ) displays a selection of ni spectra from the cept@xmath0 specimen with smallest hybridization ( @xmath32 u.c . ) along with the fits according to eq .",
    "( [ nimodel ] ) . the best fit",
    "is obtained for @xmath63 mev , @xmath64 mev and yields @xmath65 .",
    "we thus find a similar energetic ordering of the cf states as in ceag@xmath28 while the total cf splitting ( i.e. @xmath66 ) is larger by about one order of magnitude in cept@xmath0 .    while the data presented in fig .  [ fig3xld11uc](a ) demonstrate that the fits do adequately capture the essential thermal evolution of the xa spectra at normal incidence , the fact that the simulated spectra do not perfectly match the experimental peak positons and line shape gives rise to a non - negligible residual error and thus a fairly shallow optimum with associated parameter uncertainties that are relatively large",
    "the situation further aggravates as the cept@xmath0 layer thickness is reduced owing to both the reduction ce m@xmath21 tey signal above background and the increasing hybridization which reduces the magnitude of xld as discussed above .",
    "we have therefore sought an alternative means to evaluate the cf splitting from the temperature dependent xa data in a way that does not depend on an accurate simulation of the xa line shape . a simple yet robust measure of the magnitude of xld can indeed be found .",
    "it essentially consists of a relation involving ratios of the peak amplitudes of features b and c in the normal and oblique incidence spectra , respectively ( see appendix for details ) .",

    "the essential behavior of the experimental data is well covered by the model , and we obtain @xmath68 ev and @xmath69 ev , largely in line with the foregoing analysis . unlike the fitting of entire spectra , however , the analysis in terms of @xmath67 is readily carried out over the entire thickness range relevant to this study .",
    "we note that just like in fig .",
    "[ fig3xld11uc](b ) we observe @xmath70 in all specimens and at all temperatures .",
    "this finding immediately reveals that the cf state with @xmath71 character must be the one of highest energy .",

    "[ fig3xld11uc](b ) . for specimens with smaller @xmath8 such a low temperature variation of @xmath67 could not unambiguously be determined .",
    "we are therefore led to conclude that @xmath72 assumes such small values that its temperature effect essentially slips out of the temperature range accessible in our xld experiments .",
    "we shall find this idea to be confirmed by the analysis of our xmcd data , the basics of which we discuss next .",
    "the element and orbital specific measurement of the temperature dependent magnetic response provides direct access to the ce @xmath4 magnetic moments as well as independent information on the cf splittings @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4animag](a ) displays normal and oblique incidence xa and xmcd data obtained for @xmath73 u.c . at a temperature of @xmath74 k.",
    "while the small yet finite xld is discernible in the xa spectra , the xmcd datasets reveal a pronounced anisotropy in the paramagnetic response .",
    "just as @xmath75 determines the highest cf states to be of @xmath76 character from xld , it follows from the strong in - plane single ion anisotropy that @xmath77 possess large statistical weight at @xmath74 k and thus either constitute the ground state or are energetically adjacent to it .",

    "@xmath66 determines both the rate of approach of the xld parameter @xmath67 towards unity towards high temperature as well as the position of the marked kink in @xmath125 at normal incidence .",
    "also , the general trend of the paramagnetic ( single ion ) anisotropy becoming less anisotropic as @xmath8 is reduced is compatible with a reduction in @xmath66 ( given that @xmath72 is already small ) .",
    "it is not evident to unequivocally identify the cause of this transition . on the one hand it seems unlikely that the variations in lattice parameter play a major role , since the structural changes ( see ref .  )",
    "are small for @xmath126 u.c . , where the transition in @xmath66 is essentially taking place .",
    "on the other , while the region of small @xmath66 coincides with the occurrence of strong hybridization , there is no obvious further correlation with the nonmonotonous variation in hybridization strength vs.  @xmath8 which occurs in this range of intermetallic thickness .",
    "the latter has a direct bearing on the magnitude of the magnetic response , however , as is manifest from the behavior of the @xmath90 factors representing the moment reductions in fig .",

    ", we notice that a departure from curie weiss behavior may hint at emerging lattice coherence .",
    "this was e.  g.  also suggested @xcite in case of cepb@xmath141 which exhibits a magnetic anomaly very much reminiscent of the one observed here@xcite .",

    "( ref .  ) . obviously , the then expected crossover to the low temperature scaling regime with temperature independent pauli susceptibility is not yet fully undergone at @xmath13 k , indicating a small degeneracy temperature @xmath143  not infrequent in heavy electron systems @xcite .",
    "calculations within the kondo lattice model ( klm ) indicate a considerable robustness of the heavy fermion bands against temperature and magnetic fields @xcite .",

    "[ figanomaly](a ) in the framework of heavy , itinerant ce @xmath4 states .",
    "such an attempt also seems worthwhile since analyzing the measured magnetization curves in terms of local moment magnetization functions results in physically inconsistent parameters .",
    "one characteristic experimental feature is that the magnetization curve visibly approaches some saturation behavior with a ce @xmath4 saturation magnetization of @xmath145 @xmath146 per ce atom .",
    "this value amounts to only a fraction of the expected saturation moment of @xmath147 @xmath146 per atom in the local moment picture , given the hexagonal cf scheme determined above and @xmath24 .    with itinerant @xmath4 electrons ,",
    "the rationale for observing paramagnetic saturation is different from the case of local moments : it is expected to occur as a consequence of a lifshitz transition induced by the applied magnetic field , i.  e.  when the zeeman splitting shifts the chemical potential into the hybridization gap of the majority states @xcite . put differently , at very low temperature",
    "the scale on which magnetic saturation is observed is given by equating zeeman and fermi energies of the heavy band .",
    "the magnitude of saturation magnetization then depends essentially on the fraction of the brillouin zone covered by the heavy band and may indeed be small .    from this perspective , the ce @xmath4 magnetization approaching magnetic saturation at applied fields of the order of @xmath148 t implies a heavy band with a fermi energy around @xmath149 mev , corresponding to a degeneracy temperature of @xmath5 k. this is comparable to the width of the fermi - dirac distribution at 2 k and it follows immediately that a temperature independent ce @xmath4 contribution to the pauli susceptibility will only be obtained at temperatures well below the range accessible to our experiments .",
    "the klm calculations reported in ref .",
    ", when evaluated for the temperature dependent @xmath4 susceptibility , appear to lend support to such an interpretation of our findings .",
    "these caclulations do cover a parameter range down to @xmath150 and a small moment curie weiss like magnetic response is indeed found on this temperature scale @xcite .",
    "these considerations leave the question untouched whether additionally some kind of ` two liquid ' scenario might apply in analogy to those cases with @xmath151 for which this phenomenology was introduced @xcite .",
    "further work shall be required to more firmly establish the validity of the heavy fermion scenario to account for the ce @xmath4 magnetic response in cept@xmath0/pt(111 ) and is currently in progress .",
    "we finally emphasize that no changes of xa line shape and @xmath4 occupation occur in the vicinity of the temperature of the magnetic anomaly @xcite .",
    "this finding illustrates that the main role of the ` delocalization process ' at @xmath152 consists of establishing phase coherence between the ce sites , the ` local physics ' remaining essentially unaltered .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a detailed investigation of the spectral and magnetic response as detected by x - ray absorption and dichroism at the ce m@xmath21 edges of cept@xmath0/pt(111 ) ordered surface intermetallics .",
    "combining pieces of evidence from different spectroscopic modes and geometries we were able to gather relevant information on the interactions and associated energy scales in this material .",
    "the general picture emerging from our study is that for @xmath2 k we are essentially concerned with the `` impurity regime '' featuring substantially kondo - screened local moments , subjected to a hexagonal crystal field and weak ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the cf ground state is essentially a quasi - quartet of the @xmath77 and @xmath153 states .",
    "the @xmath76 states are split off by @xmath154 mev in the range of small intermetallic thickness , whereas the splitting increases to @xmath155 mev at larger @xmath8 .",
    "the tunability of hybridization by epitaxial strain provides us with a non - thermal control parameter in a surface science experiment .",
    "the ce @xmath4 paramagnetic moment clearly depends on hybridization strength and we observe the strongest moment reduction in the case of strongest hybridization .",
    "it is maybe an interesting observation that strong hybridization coincides with small overall cf splitting .",
    "a similar correlation appears to hold in case of ceag@xmath28 , albeit on a much smaller energy scale @xcite .",
    "while the magnitude of kondo screening is compatible with an impurity kondo scale of order @xmath19 k as previously determined from the temperature dependent ce valence@xcite , the magnetic response at lowest temperature is not . instead , for specimens with @xmath73 u.c .",
    "we find an anomaly in the magnetic response at @xmath156 k which we discuss as potentially signalling the onset of lattice coherence .",
    "a coherence temperature of this order is well in line with previous experimental evidence . adopting this view",
    ", we may understand the occurrence of paramagnetic saturation with a small saturation moment as to emerge from a field induced lifshitz transition .",
    "the observation of a saturation field of the order of 6 t is then indicative of a very narrow @xmath4 band with correspondingly small degeneracy temperature .",
    "such a small inherent energy scale readily accounts for the fact that a temperature independent @xmath4 contribution to the pauli susceptibility is not observed within the temperature range of our experiment ( @xmath6 k ) .",
    "altogether , our results demonstrate the promising potential of x - ray absorption measurements for investigations of correlated matter , yielding results that are complementary to other methods of surface science . it is the unique capability of xa and xmcd to specifically detect the spectral and magnetic response of the @xmath4 degrees of freedom which allows one to gain insight in several small energy scales coexisting in heavy fermion materials .",
    "we hope that our work will stimulate interest in carrying over the methodology to other heavy fermion materials .",
