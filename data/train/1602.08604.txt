    "quantum state tomography @xcite , characterizing the state of a quantum system via quantum measurements and data processing , is a starting point and the standard for verification and benchmarking of various quantum information processing tasks , such as quantum computation @xcite , cryptography @xcite , and metrology @xcite .    to reconstruct quantum states wherein we have no _ a priori _ information",
    ", we can resort to informationally ( over)complete measurements .",
    "quantum state tomography @xcite using informationally ( over)complete measurements is referred as _ full quantum state tomography _ ( fqst ) in this paper .",
    "as there are ( @xmath2 ) independent parameters to characterize the density matrix of a @xmath3-dimensional quantum state , fqst needs at least ( @xmath4 ) measurement operators .",
    "note that the dimension @xmath3 grows exponentially with the size of the quantum system .",
    "thus , the number of measurements and the computational complexity of data processing in fqst suffer the curse of dimensionality .",
    "moreover , the time of data processing was found to be even much longer than the time required for implementing the measurements . as reported in @xcite , reconstructing an 8-qubit state using maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) @xcite took almost a week , while the measurement time was only 10 hours @xcite . with the breakthrough and rapid development of experimental techniques ,",
    "the size of quantum systems with entanglement or coherence prepared in the laboratory has already grown from 2 qubits @xcite to 10 qubits in photonic systems ( e.g. , 8 qubits in @xcite and 10 qubits in @xcite ) , 12 qubits in nmr @xcite and to even 14 qubits @xcite in ion traps , overwhelming the capability of the available full quantum state tomography .",
    "much effort has been devoted to improving the performance of quantum state tomography @xcite . some methods focused on extracting partial concerned information .",
    "for example , entanglement witness @xcite can detect entanglement with few measurements ; direct purity estimation @xcite and fidelity estimation @xcite were utilized to obtain the purity of the prepared state and its fidelity with the ideal state ; permutationally invariant tomography @xcite was used to extract information that will not change under permutation .",
    "several approaches were concerned on performing quantum state tomography with _ a priori _ knowledge or assumptions .",
    "for example , compressed sensing @xcite can perform quantum state tomography for quantum states with a low rank .",
    "if a quantum state is a matrix product state , it is possible to develop efficient tomography algorithms @xcite .",
    "however , these methods either extract partial information or have some prior information about the state to be reconstructed .    several approaches have also been presented to reduce the computational complexity in the reconstruction algorithms in fqst @xcite .",
    "for example , the authors in @xcite developed an algorithm which can be used to efficiently reconstruct a 9-qubit state in about five minutes .",
    "however , when the size of the quantum system increases one qubit , the running time will increase by a factor of more than ten according to fig .  1 in @xcite , resulting in years of computation time for a 14-qubit state . in @xcite , a linear regression estimation ( lre ) algorithm",
    "was proposed which has a much lower computational complexity than that of mle for quantum state tomography @xcite . in this paper , we push the data processing capability of fqst to a 14-qubit state using the informationally overcomplete pauli measurements by optimizing the lre algorithm in @xcite and employing parallel programming with graphics processing unit ( gpu ) .    for experimental ease and high level of estimation accuracy , pauli measurements are the preferred choice in experiments of fqst , although they are informationally overcomplete .",
    "lre was demonstrated to be much more efficient than mle in fqst @xcite . however , in order to reconstruct a 14-qubit state efficiently , we need to further optimize the lre method .",
    "the efficiency of fqst in this paper refers solely to the reduced computational complexity of data processing .",
    "our first optimization is based on the fact that the representation of pauli bases in the algorithm has very few nonzero elements under a proper choice of the representation .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the simple lre algorithm which only involves additions and multiplications of vectors and matrices , it is naturally suitable to be sped up by parallel programming . in parallel programming of matrix computation",
    ", gpu works much better than the central processing unit ( cpu ) .",
    "hence , we can use gpu parallel programming to realize the lre algorithm and enhance the fqst capability .",
    "compared with the result in @xcite , in this paper we optimize the lre method with reduced computational complexity and storage requirement , and implement the optimized lre method using gpu parallel programming .",
    "the results show significant enhancement of the fqst capability .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : lre ] provides a brief introduction to the three steps of lre and analyzes the computational complexity and the storage requirement in the case of informationally complete measurements . in sec .",
    "[ sec : complexity ] , computational complexity and storage requirement are discussed based on pauli measurements . in sec .",
    "[ sec : parallel gpu programming ] , the lre algorithm in the first two steps is realized using parallel gpu programming .",
    "the run time of the algorithm with gpu speeding up is also compared with that using cpu programming . in sec .",
    "[ sec : accracy ] , the estimation error of reconstructing a maximally - mixed state is analyzed in terms of squared hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) distance and infidelity .",
    "[ sec : sum ] presents the summary and prospect of this paper .",
    "in linear regression estimation ( lre ) for a @xmath3-dimensional quantum system , the density matrix and measurement bases take a vector form after we choose a representation basis set @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the operators in this basis set are orthonormal , i.e. , @xmath6 . for convenience ,",
    "let @xmath7 and all the bases are traceless except @xmath8 .",

    "a least - squared estimate @xmath20 , without consideration of the positivity restriction of quantum states , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the measured frequency of @xmath15 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the computational complexity in this step is at least @xmath25 , since fqst requires an informationally complete measurement set @xmath13 with @xmath26 . for a 14-qubit state , @xmath27 and the computational complexity",
    "is @xmath28 .    in step ( ii ) , on the basis of the solution @xmath20 to ( [ eq : theta ] ) in step ( i ) , we can obtain a hermitian matrix @xmath17 with @xmath18 by @xmath29 the computational complexity in this step is also @xmath25 .",
    "the state estimate @xmath17 obtained in may have negative eigenvalues and be nonphysical due to the randomness of the finite measurement results . in step ( iii )",
    ", a proper method needs to be adopted to pull @xmath17 back to a physical state . in this step ,",
    "we use the fast algorithm proposed in @xcite , where a physical estimate @xmath19 is chosen to be the closest density matrix to @xmath17 under the matrix 2-norm . according to @xcite ,",
    "the computational complexity in this step is @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that the computational complexity in lre is dominated by the first two steps , which is @xmath25 . for a 14-qubit state ,",
    "this is @xmath28 . in terms of storage , @xmath25 and @xmath31",
    "bytes are required to store all the measurement bases and measurement results , respectively , for an informationally - complete measurement set . for a 14-qubit state ,",
    "this needs tens of thousands of terabytes , which is beyond the capability for practical applications . in the following ,",
    "we develop a method to reduce the computational complexity and storage requirement .",
    "pauli measurements are a good choice to extract information in quantum state tomography of @xmath32-qubit systems ( @xmath33 ) because of not only their experimental ease but also the ability to achieve a high level of accuracy .",
    "with all the possible combinations of pauli measurements for @xmath32-qubit systems , the total number of measurement bases is @xmath34 . without optimization ,",
    "this informationally - overcomplete measurement set further increases the computational complexity in step ( i ) to @xmath0 for a 14-qubit state and also increases the storage requirement from @xmath28 to @xmath0 .",
    "the computational complexity and storage requirement can be greatly reduced because many terms in @xmath14 are zero when @xmath5 are chosen as the tensor product of @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , and pauli matrices @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . for an @xmath32-qubit state ,",
    "@xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    in the 1-qubit scenario , inserting into , one can easily obtain @xmath14 for all the eigenvectors of the three pauli operators @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the term @xmath49 is calculated to be a diagonal matrix with @xmath50 . as for the @xmath32-qubit scenario ,",
    "since the measurement bases are the tensor product of those for single qubits , @xmath14 and @xmath49 are also the tensor products of their counterparts for relevant 1-qubit cases .",
    "thus , there will be only @xmath51 nonzero elements in @xmath14 , instead of the original @xmath52 , and @xmath49 are diagonal . dropping all zero elements will reduce the computational complexity in step ( i ) from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , i.e. , from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , for a 14-qubit state .",
    "after the optimization in step ( i ) , the computational complexity @xmath55 in step ( ii ) is dominant . recall the definition of @xmath56 in ,",
    "there are only @xmath51 nonzero elements .",
    "therefore , after dropping all zero elements , the computational complexity in step ( ii ) can be reduced to @xmath57 ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) for a 14-qubit state .",
    "since the computational complexity in step ( iii ) is only @xmath57 , the total computational complexity with pauli measurements is @xmath54 .    in terms of storage , without dropping the zero elements , @xmath59 bytes are needed to store all the measurement bases . even after dropping all the zero elements ,",
    "the storage requirement is still @xmath60 for the nonzero elements and their locations .",
    "however , the storage requirement of the measurement bases can be further reduced to @xmath61 after the @xmath62 bases are divided into @xmath63 groups .",
    "the @xmath51 operators in each group are all the eigenvectors of one combination of three pauli operators .",
    "the @xmath51 nonzero elements in each of these @xmath51 operators in the same group share the same locations .",
    "all the nonzero values of operators in one group form a @xmath64 nonzero matrix , which is the same for all the @xmath63 groups .",
    "hence , we only need to store @xmath63 types of locations of nonzero elements ( with @xmath61 storage requirement ) , and a @xmath64 nonzero matrix ( with @xmath65 storage requirement ) .",
    "besides , the storage requirement for the measurement results of all the @xmath66 bases also requires @xmath61 .",
    "thus , all the needed storage is only @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the storage cost in the 14-qubit scenario is @xmath67 , which is only tens of giga bytes .",
    "thanks to the direct and simple formula of the lre algorithm in and , only addition and multiplication operations of matrices or vectors are involved , which are naturally suitable for parallel programming .",
    "graphic processing units possess powerful capability for parallel programming .",
    "this technique is exploited to speed up the computation in both step ( i ) and step ( ii ) .",
    "the computer hardware includes 500 gb hard drive , 16 gb memory , i7 - 4770 cpu with 3.5 ghz , 4 cores and 8 threads , and gtx780 gpu with 2304 cuda cores and 3 g standard memory .    as analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec : complexity ] , step ( i ) has the dominant computational complexity @xmath54 .",
    "gpu parallel programming is employed in this step . according to the locations of nonzero elements",
    ", all the measurement bases can be divided into @xmath63 groups .",
    "each group has @xmath51 measurement bases . in parallel gpu programming , firstly , one group of measurement bases and their measurement data",
    "are put in , wherein the data include a @xmath64 nonzero matrix , @xmath51 nonzero locations and @xmath51 measurement results . to be parallel , each thread is devoted to calculating one element of @xmath20 , whose location is in the @xmath51 nonzero locations .",
    "hence , only @xmath51 elements of the total @xmath52 elements in @xmath20 need to be calculated and updated for one group of data .",
    "all the threads are synchronized after updating these @xmath51 elements of @xmath20 to get ready for the computation of the next group of data",
    ". then this process continues until all the @xmath63 groups of data are computed .    in order to show the relationship between the amount of speedup and the number of parallel threads in gpu programming , the reciprocal of the run time in step ( i ) for a maximally - mixed 12-qubit state",
    "is plotted with respect to @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig : threads ] , where @xmath68 is the number of streaming multiprocessors ( sms ) . here , we only consider step ( i ) for simplicity , because step ( i ) has the dominant computational complexity .",
    "there are 12 sms in the gtx780 gpu and each sm contains 192 cuda cores .",
    "since each cuda core is occupied by a thread , @xmath68 sms can execute 192@xmath68 threads in parallel .",
    "[ fig : threads ] shows that the speed in step ( i ) , which is denoted by the reciprocal of the time cost , increases almost proportionally with the number of parallel threads , represented by the number of sms .",
    "hence , all the sms are used in gpu programming to gain the fastest speed in the rest simulations .    using this approach",
    "we now demonstrate the computation time of reconstructing multi - qubit states using our algorithm .",
    "the computation time of gpu programming in step ( i ) costs 2.78 hours for a 14-qubit state as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : first_step ] . in comparison , to reconstruct a 11-qubit state , the cpu programming has taken almost half an hour for step ( i ) and will be difficult to compute larger systems as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : first_step ] .    in step ( ii ) , the time cost of cpu programming for a 14-qubit state approximates to be 10 hours according to the numerical fitting line ( blue dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : second_step ] , which is much longer than the run time of step ( i ) via gpu programming .",
    "hence , gpu programming is also used to speed up the computation in this step .",
    "we note that the nonzero elements in @xmath69 and @xmath70 have the same locations , and so it is for @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus all the @xmath73 @xmath74 , which are constructed in by the above four matrices , can be divided into @xmath51 groups according to the same locations of nonzero elements . in parallel gpu programming , one group of @xmath51 @xmath74 and",
    "the corresponding @xmath51 elements in @xmath20 are put in .",
    "each thread is responsible to calculate one of the corresponding @xmath51 elements in @xmath17 .",
    "all the threads are synchronized after finishing the update of the @xmath51 elements in @xmath17 to get prepared for the next group of data .",
    "then this step is repeated until all the @xmath51 groups of data are calculated . with parallel gpu programming , the computation time in step ( ii )",
    "is reduced to only 0.08 hours , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : second_step ] .    in step ( iii ) , we do not need gpu programming since the time cost of cpu programming with mathematica is only 0.49 hours ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : third_step ] ) for a 14-qubit state , which is already about 5 times shorter than the computation time in step ( i ) using gpu programming .",
    "the total computation time of the whole process in reconstructing a 14-qubit state turns out to be only 3.35 hours , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_step ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : total_step ] , we know that our optimized lre algorithm based on cpu programming ( blue ) is already more than 100 times faster than the efficient algorithm in @xcite for reconstructing a 9-qubit state . however , according to the numerical fitting line in fig .",
    "[ fig : total_step ] , reconstructing a 14-qubit state will take more than a month using our optimized algorithm with cpu programming . this is also a reason why we resort to gpu programming for further speeding up through considering the parallelism of our algorithm . in our numerical simulations ,",
    "all states are chosen as the maximally - mixed states in @xmath32-qubit systems only for the ease of obtaining the simulated measurement frequency .",
    "our method is applicable to other states because the computational complexity and run time are state independent .",
    "in this section , the error between the estimate and the real state is discussed in terms of the squared hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) distance and infidelity .",
    "the mean squared hs distance between the estimate state @xmath17 in step ( ii ) and the true state @xmath10 is @xmath75 , asymptotically given by @xmath76,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the total number of copies for all the @xmath12 operators and @xmath78 , with @xmath79 .",
    "here we have one more factor of @xmath80 than eq .",
    "( 9 ) in @xcite since every @xmath3 measurement bases form a complete set of povm and can be measured simultaneously . as these @xmath3 measurement bases are measured simultaneously , the corresponding off - diagonal elements in @xmath81 are of @xmath82 rather than zero . but these off - diagonal elements are much smaller than the diagonal elements when the size of the quantum system is large .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 is still approximated to only have diagonal elements in the case of simultaneous measurements .",
    "this mean squared hs distance obviously depends on the unknown state . here",
    "we calculate the mean squared hs distance when @xmath10 is chosen as the maximally - mixed state , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "one reason for this state choice is that an elegant theoretical result can be derived due to the simple form of a maximally - mixed state ; the other reason is that the maximally - mixed state often gives the larger mean squared hs distance than the other states . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath84 in the first order of approximation .",
    "when pauli measurements are performed on copies of a @xmath32-qubit maximally - mixed state , the mean squared hs distance ( blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : estimation error 14 ] ) is equal to @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "this theoretical result agrees well with the numerical results of @xmath87 ( blue crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : estimation error 14 ] ) .",
    "thanks to the positivity condition , compared with @xmath87 , the squared hs distance of a physical estimate @xmath19 for the real state ( denoted as red dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : estimation error 14 ] ) is further reduced for @xmath88 although it remains the same when @xmath89 for a 14-qubit maximally - mixed state .",
    "another well - motivated figure of merit is infidelity , defined as @xmath90 .",
    "when @xmath10 is chosen as the maximally - mixed state , infidelity is directly related to the squared hs distance by @xmath91 . in the large - number limit of @xmath92 ,",
    "@xmath17 has non - negative eigenvalues and we have @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the average infidelity is well approximated by @xmath94 ( green line ) in this limit .",
    "however , when @xmath92 is small , @xmath17 will have negative eigenvalues and needs to be pulled back to a physical state @xmath19 .",
    "hence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : estimation error 14 ] , the real infidelity ( green diamonds ) is much smaller than the prediction ( green line ) for @xmath95 in the 14-qubit scenario .",
    "in this paper , we have fully reconstructed a 14-qubit state with a modest computation time of 3.35 hours using informationally overcomplete pauli measurements . by a smart choice of the representation basis set in the algorithm ,",
    "only very few nonzero elements exist and need to be stored and calculated , which reduce the computational complexity by a factor of @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , parallel gpu programming is used to fully exploit the parallelism in the simple lre algorithm .",
    "it is worth pointing out that our method can push the capability of fqst forward to even larger quantum systems .",
    "this is because the measurement bases in our analysis and simulations are chosen as pauli measurements , which are overcomplete .",
    "if we reduce the number of measurement bases from @xmath66 to @xmath52 , the computational complexity can be reduced to @xmath57 from @xmath54 , which can further enhance the capability of fqst via our optimized lre .",
