    "atomic systems driven in the configuration of electromagnetically induced transparency involving a rydberg state ( rydberg eit ) @xcite are promising systems for the investigation of quantum nonlinear optics @xcite and quantum many - body physics @xcite with strong interactions and correlations .",
    "with rydberg eit , non - linearity at the single photon level has been demonstrated with the remarkable realizations of photon filters , deterministic single photon sources , and interaction between pairs of photons @xcite , and also been utilized to implement single - photon transistors @xcite . moreover",
    ", the recent demonstration of interaction enhanced absorption imaging ( ieai ) @xcite confirms the great potential of rydberg eit for the study of many - body physics with rydberg atoms .    in rydberg eit , highly correlated many - body atomic states arising from the interaction - induced blockade @xcite result in strong nonlinear optical response , and can be mapped onto the probe field propagating through the medium .",
    "thus detailed studies on the spectral , temporal , and spatial properties of the transmitted probe light are crucial for proper understanding of such systems and their further applications in quantum optics , quantum information , and quantum many - body physics . because of the large parameter space and complex dynamics of rydberg eit ensembles in the blockade regime ,",
    "many questions remain open in spite of significant investigation efforts , both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite .",
    "all of rydberg eit experiments in the blockade regime have observed the reduction of the eit transparency at the probe resonance due to rydberg blockade induced dissipation , also called photon blockade @xcite .",
    "however , the spectral shift of the transparency resonance , as predicted by several theoretical models , has only been observed in two experiments @xcite , but remains elusive in others .",
    "theoretical calculations , while succeeding to describe certain experimental observations , have yet converged to a comprehensive physical picture due to the challenges posted by strong correlation and dissipation in such systems .    in this article",
    ", we present a study of the rydberg eit spectra in presence of interaction and their dependence on atomic density , input probe light intensity , and principal quantum number of rydberg states .",
    "we show that all the features of the spectra can be quantified phenomenologically via an effective shift and an effective dephasing rate in the optical bloch equations describing the evolution of non interacting atoms driven under conditions of rydberg eit , as in reference @xcite .",
    "our experimental data are in good agreement with a semi - analytical model based on previous results obtained from the monte carlo rate equations approach @xcite and the superatom model @xcite .",
    "we find that the spectral shift is accurately accounted for by an average energy level shift due to the interaction between rydberg atoms , while the effective dephasing rate mainly comes from the photon blockade effect and dephasing inherent to the dispersion of rydberg energy level shifts .",
    "the dephasing rate increases with the eit pulse duration at large parameter regime and deviates from the model because of the presence of additional dephasing mechanisms .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that as the size of a gaussian atomic cloud is increased , the measured spectral shift is reduced .",
    "this study provides important experimental evidences to advance the understanding on the spectral properties of rydberg eit .",

    "atoms were loaded into the odt from a molasses cooled atomic ensemble , the preparation of which was detailed in ref.@xcite .",
    "subsequently , a guiding field of approximately 3.5 gauss along the vertical direction pointing downwards was switched on to define the quantization axis @xmath10 , and the atoms in the odt were optically pumped into the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) state . at this stage ,",

    "[ sizedependent],width=321 ]    an important experimental observation is that the spectral shift is smaller for a gaussian atomic sample with larger size than for a smaller size one , while both have the same peak atomic density , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sizedependent ] .",
    "this reduction in the observed shift can be explained by the inhomogeneity of the eit ensemble together with the dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ extractedplotemf ] .",
    "as the probe light enters the atomic sample , it first sees the lower atomic density at the wing part of the gaussian density profile ; and when the light reaches the center of the sample with the high atomic density , its intensity has already been attenuated due to scattering along its way . given the similar peak atomic density , this effect of inhomogeneity in a thicker atomic sample obviously is more pronounced than that in a thinner one , and correspondingly results in smaller spectral shift .",
    "in conclusion , we have measured the spectral shift and dephasing rate of rydberg eit and clearly mapped out their dependence on density , probe rabi frequency , and rydberg principal quantum number . while the spectral shifts agree very well with theoretical predictions obtained in the frozen gas approximation over the whole parameter range , the dephasing rates are consistently larger than predicted at high rydberg excitation or large blockade .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to motional dephasing and invites further investigations .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the observed spectral shift also depends on the size of the gaussian atomic sample . this clear observation of spectral shift raises the prospect to realize interaction induced optical switches , and these spectroscopic measurements are highly relevant for imaging rydberg excitations via ieai based on rydberg eit",
    ". moreover , it would be interesting to extend our experiment into the parameter regime , where collective excitations could give a rydberg excitation fraction higher than that of a noninteracting rydberg gas @xcite .",
