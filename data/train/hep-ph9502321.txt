    "in the standard model of electroweak interactions all masses are generated by the higgs mechanism . at high temperatures",

    ", the present value of the baryon asymmetry of the universe has finally been determined at the electroweak transition .    in recent years quantitative studies of the electroweak phase transition have been carried out by means of resummed perturbation theory @xcite-@xcite and lattice monte carlo simulations @xcite-@xcite . as a first step towards a treatment of the full standard model , the pure su(2 ) higgs model",
    "is usually investigated , neglecting fermion effects and the mixing between photon and neutral vector boson .",
    "these can be treated in perturbation theory and do not affect the essential infrared problem .",
    "there is general agreement that the phase transition is first - order for higgs masses @xmath2 below the vector boson mass @xmath3 . at larger higgs masses lattice results @xcite , general arguments @xcite and non - perturbative solutions of gap equations",
    "@xcite suggest that the first - order transition changes to a smooth crossover .",
    "however , this conjecture still remains to be firmly established .",
    "the goal of the present paper is a quantitative study of the thermodynamics of the transition for higgs masses below 80 gev .",
    "our analysis will be based on the gauge invariant `` order parameter '' @xmath4 @xcite and the corresponding free energy @xcite .",
    "we shall extend our previous one - loop analysis @xcite to two - loop order and discuss the connection with the conventional landau gauge approach .",
    "the comparison between one - loop and two - loop results , and also between different resummation procedures , will allow us to estimate the uncertainty of perturbative predictions for thermodynamic observables .",
    "it is well known that the electroweak phase transition is influenced by non - perturbative effects whose size is governed by the confinement scale of the effective three - dimensional theory which describes the high - temperature limit of the su(2 ) higgs model .",
    "these effects are particularly relevant in the symmetric phase , and one may worry to what extent a purely perturbative analysis of the phase transition can yield sensible results at all . however , it is not yet known how important these non - perturbative effects are quantitatively for different higgs masses . as we shall see , at two - loop order our results depend only logarithmically on the infrared cutoff needed in the symmetric phase .",
    "we shall then compare the perturbative results with recent non - perturbative results obtained by numerical monte carlo simulations on large lattices @xcite .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we shall discuss several general aspects of the free energy and the various effective potentials used in connection with the electroweak phase transition .",
    "the description of the transition is based on a gauge invariantly coupled source term .",
    "the corresponding gauge invariant free energy can be obtained from the minima of the usual landau gauge potential .    in sect .",
    "3 a useful relation is derived between the latent heat and the gauge invariant order parameter , which follows from the clausius - clapeyron equation by dimensional arguments . this relation is exactly satisfied in perturbation theory , and it holds for the lattice results within the estimated errors .    sect . 4 deals with the free energy at one - loop . a new resummation procedure is introduced which treats the higgs phase and the symmetric phase differently , reproducing the numerical results of @xcite in a different manner .",
    "this also clarifies the connection between the gauge invariant and the usual landau gauge approach .",
    "it is shown that the barrier of the gauge invariant effective potential is given by analytic continuations of the convex potential defined by a legendre transformation .    in sect .",
    "5 higher order corrections are obtained using the new resummation method of the previous section .",
    "this calculation is an extension of the gauge invariant approach of @xcite to the two - loop level .",
    "while previous numerical results for phase transition parameters are qualitatively reproduced , the convergence of perturbation theory is improved in the new approach .",

    "the results are shown in figs . 4 - 6 , assuming standard model values @xmath91 80.22 gev and @xmath92 251.78 gev at zero temperature .    in fig .",
    "4 the critical temperature in units of the higgs mass is plotted as function of the higgs mass in the range 30 gev@xmath9380 gev .",
    "below 30 gev the high - temperature expansion is unreliable , and above 80 gev the convergence of the loop expansion deteriorates rapidly .",
    "the two - loop results are compared with one - loop results for the `` old resummation '' @xcite and for the `` new resummation '' described above . in the `` new resummation ''",

    "the relative change of an observable from one - loop to two - loop may be characterized by @xmath94 . in the `` new resummation '' @xmath95 in the whole range of higgs masses considered .",
    "the jump in the order parameter at the critical temperature @xmath38 is shown in fig .",
    "5 . in the case of",
    "`` old resummation '' @xmath96 corresponds to the position of the second minimum , for `` new resummation '' it is @xmath97 .",
    "again the `` new resummation '' procedure improves the convergence significantly .",
    "the relative error increases from @xmath98 at @xmath99 gev to @xmath100 at @xmath101 gev .    in fig .",
    "6 the latent heat @xmath40 in units of the critical temperature is plotted as function of the higgs mass .",
    "this is a measure of the strength of the first - order phase transition . like the jump in the order parameter it decreases with increasing higgs mass .",
    "based on the clausius - clapeyron equation , which is satisfied exactly , we expect @xmath102 .",
    "hence , the convergence should be worse than for the order parameter .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "the relative error increases from @xmath103 at @xmath99 gev to @xmath104 at @xmath101 gev .",
    "it appears satisfactory that the new , asymmetric resummation procedure leads to an improved convergence of the perturbative expansion .",
    "the `` old resummation '' is based on a systematic expansion of the free energy in powers of the couplings @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "therefore in the symmetric phase , where the scalar masses are positive , the differences can only correspond to contributions of higher order .",
    "this ambiguity in the resummation procedure is analogous to the well known dependence of results in perturbative qcd on the renormalization scheme .",
    "however , setting the goldstone mass to zero in the higgs phase does not correspond to a simple rearrangement of the series , since terms non - analytic in @xmath105 are present .",
    "the correct treatment of the higgs phase is the main qualitative advantage of the new resummation .",
    "in the previous sections we have presented a quantitative description of the electroweak phase transition in the perturbative approach . using different resummations in the higgs phase and in the symmetric phase",
    ", we concluded that for higgs boson masses below @xmath0 gev the perturbative approach converges , and that this description is therefore self - consistent .",
    "however , for higgs masses above the present experimental lower bound , @xmath106 gev , the loop expansion becomes unreliable . in this relevant range of the parameter space the electroweak phase transition can only be understood by means of non - perturbative methods .",
    "lattice monte carlo simulations provide a well defined and systematic approach to study this problem .",
    "for all higgs masses , non - perturbative effects may be important in the symmetric phase . by comparing data from lattice simulations for the su(2 )",
    "higgs model with the perturbative results one can hope to identify non - perturbative features and to achieve a better understanding of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "therefore , in this section we shall present a detailed comparison between data of the recent large scale four - dimensional lattice works @xcite and published results of the `` old resummation '' @xcite . for the considered higgs masses they differ little from the `` new resummation '' results .",
    "monte carlo simulations for higgs boson masses near or above the w - boson mass are technically difficult , thus in @xcite the higgs masses @xmath107 gev and @xmath108 gev have been studied . since in this parameter range",
    "the perturbative expansion converges rather well , one may expect agreement between perturbative and non - perturbative results with comparable accuracy .",
    "the @xmath109-potential of @xcite involves a high - temperature expansion up to order @xmath110 , which is unsatisfactory for @xmath111 gev .",
    "thus , we have included all one - loop contributions of order @xmath112 in our present @xmath109-potential .",
    "note , that the numerical evaluation of the one - loop temperature integrals gives a result which agrees with the above approximation up to a few percent .    for small higgs boson",
    "masses the renormalization scheme dependence is non - negligible . therefore , instead of the @xmath113-scheme with @xmath114 , we shall use the scheme suggested by arnold and espinosa @xcite , which includes the most important zero - temperature renormalization effects . in this scheme",
    "the correction to the @xmath113-potential , used for both the one- and the two - loop results , reads v=^2 2 ( + 1 2 ^ 2 ) + 4 ^4 , where = 9g^4v^2 256 ^2 ,  = -9g^4256 ^ 2(+23 ) . here",
    "@xmath115 is the zero - temperature vacuum expectation value and @xmath3 is the w - boson mass at @xmath116 .    in @xcite",
    "several observables have been determined , including renormalized masses at zero temperature ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , critical temperature ( @xmath38 ) , jump in the order parameter ( @xmath96 ) , latent heat ( @xmath40 ) and surface tension ( @xmath117 ) . as usual , the dimensionful quantities have been normalized by the proper power of the critical temperature .",
    "the simulations have been performed on @xmath118 and @xmath119 lattices ( @xmath120 is the temporal extension of the finite - temperature asymmetric lattice ) .",
    "the @xmath119 results should be closer to the continuum values , and we therefore compare these data with the perturbative results .",
    "an exception is the surface tension for which only @xmath118 data exist .    in the previous sections we have only evaluated @xmath38 , @xmath96 and @xmath121 , which follow from the free energy of a homogeneous phase .",
    "the surface tension is more complicated to calculate , since it involves the boundary between two phases . in perturbation theory",
    "this is related to the effective potential @xmath37 in the region between the two local minima . for completeness",
    ", we include the surface tension in the comparison , although so far no satisfactory treatment has been achieved in perturbation theory for higgs masses above @xmath122 gev .",

    "the systematic errors can be estimated by the difference between the @xmath118 and the @xmath119 data . as fig .",
    "15 of @xcite suggests , the true systematic error for @xmath123 may be larger than this naive estimate .",
    "thus , for @xmath123 we have doubled the above error . for the surface tension , where only @xmath118 data exist",
    ", the systematic error has been estimated as twice the statistical one .",
    "a correct comparison has to include errors on the parameters used in the perturbative calculation .",
    "these uncertainties are connected with the fact that neither the higgs boson mass nor the gauge coupling has been determined exactly .",
    "therefore , the perturbative prediction for an observable is not one definite value but rather an interval , given by the uncertainties of @xmath2 and @xmath53 . in this analysis",
    "only the statistical errors in the determination of the higgs boson mass and the gauge coupling have been included .",
    "we have also neglected corrections due to the different renormalization conditions used for the gauge coupling @xmath53 and the order parameter @xmath4 on the lattice and in the continuum .",
    "these corrections are expected to be of relative order @xmath124 .",
    "let us first check the validity of the clausius - clapeyron equation for the lattice monte carlo simulations .",

    "we emphasize that , both in the perturbative calculation and in the lattice simulations , the surface tension is the most problematic quantity .    for @xmath127 gev ( cf .",

    "the two plots may be interpreted in the following way . for small",
    "higgs boson masses the perturbative approach is in very good shape , already the one - loop approximation gives a reliable result .",
    "as @xmath2 grows , the higher order contributions become more and more important , yet a two - loop calculation is still satisfactory for @xmath126 gev . in this range of parameters",
    "the non - perturbative features of the symmetric phase are not important enough to destroy the perturbative picture .",
    "in the present paper a quantitative description of the electroweak phase transition based on a gauge invariantly coupled source term has been attempted .",
    "our main result is that for higgs masses below @xmath0 gev thermodynamic observables can be evaluated with reasonable accuracy in perturbation theory . above @xmath134",
    "gev the perturbative expansion breaks down , which is in agreement with previous estimates @xcite .",

    "such an improvement has been explicitly verified for the available terms up to two - loop order . due to infrared divergencies of the non - abelian theory a cutoff",
    "is needed in the symmetric phase at two - loop order .",
    "we emphasize that due to the small cutoff dependence at not too large higgs masses perturbation theory may work with some accuracy in the symmetric phase .",
    "the size of non - perturbative effects can only be determined by comparing perturbative results with fully non - perturbative lattice simulations .",
    "we have carried out such a comparison , based on results of recent simulations on large lattices @xcite .",
    "the good quantitative agreement found for higgs mass values @xmath111 gev and @xmath108 gev is interpreted as evidence for the correctness of the present understanding of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "non - perturbative effects present in the symmetric phase are neglected by perturbation theory , but they should contribute to the lattice results . we conclude that these effects can not be of major importance at small higgs mass , since otherwise no quantitative agreement with lattice data could be observed .    applying the clausius - clapeyron equation to the electroweak phase transition a simple relation between latent",
    "heat and jump of the order parameter has been derived .",
    "being in good agreement with perturbative as well as with lattice data , it strengthens confidence in the correctness of the treatment of the phase transition .",
    "the above arguments support the conclusion that our understanding of the electroweak phase transition has reached a quantitative level for higgs masses up to @xmath0 gev . a strong decrease of the strength of the first - order transition with increasing higgs mass is observed .",
    "however , a complete understanding of the process of symmetry restoration for large higgs masses is still lacking .",
    "other important questions include the description of metastable and unstable states , relevant for the dynamics of the transition .",
    "in this appendix , for the convenience of the reader , all the contributions to the effective potential from one and two - loop graphs ( see fig .",
    "9 ) are listed in @xmath113-scheme .",
    "this calculation has already been performed in @xcite up to order @xmath132 and extended in @xcite to the order @xmath135 .",
    "the different contributions are presented according to the counterterm method of resummation , applied to the zero modes only @xcite .",
    "the scalar resummation is left unspecified , since it is different in the symmetric phase and in the higgs phase following the approach of section [ tl ] .",
    "it is characterized by the values of the scalar masses @xmath136 and @xmath137 , and the scalar counter term @xmath138 , present in @xmath139 .",
