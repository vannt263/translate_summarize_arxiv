    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) consist of stellar material ejected by low- and intermediate - mass stars ( 0.81.0  m@xmath5810  m@xmath6 ) . towards the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , these stars experience copious mass loss and eject most of their stellar envelope through a slow , dense agb wind . the ejected material is subsequently ionized by the central star and becomes a pn .",
    "pne eventually disperse into the interstellar medium as they expand , whereas the stellar cores , mainly composed of carbon and oxygen , will evolve toward the white dwarf stage .",
    "near the time when the hot stellar core is exposed , the slow agb wind , with terminal velocities 530 km s@xmath4 @xcite , is superseded by a fast stellar wind with terminal velocities 1,0004,000 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this fast stellar wind sweeps up the slower agb wind to form a pn @xcite . in this",
    "interacting stellar winds ( isw ) model , the physical structure of a pn would be similar to that of a wind - blown bubble , as modeled by @xcite , comprising a central cavity filled with shocked fast wind ( the so - called hot bubble ) , a dense shell of swept - up agb wind at 10@xmath7 k , and an outer envelope of unperturbed expanding agb wind . in a simplistic model , the temperature of the shocked stellar wind inside the hot bubble would be 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath9 k , but turbulent mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or heat conduction @xcite lowers the temperature of the hot gas to 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath8 k and raises its density to produce optimal conditions for the emission of soft x - rays .",
    "therefore , x - ray observations of shock - heated hot gas in pne provide us a direct means to examine the interaction of the fast stellar wind with the agb wind and to investigate the transfer of energy and momentum to the pn envelope .",
    "_ rosat _ observations showed hints of diffuse x - ray emission in a few pne @xcite .",

    ", with their unprecedented resolution and sensitivity , that we were finally able to unambiguously detect hot gas in pne .",

    "there is , however , an unsolved puzzle : the analyses of the chemical composition of the x - ray - emitting plasma in pne suggest that it is mainly composed of stellar wind , with little contamination of material from the cold nebular shell ( e.g. , ngc2392 and ngc6543 , * ? ? ?",

    "these two shells are further enclosed by arcs and a giant broken halo revealed by deep images @xcite .",

    "the comparison between the x - ray contours and the optical image suggests that the x - ray - emitting gas is confined within the innermost shell of ngc3242 , as the location of the lowest intensity level x - ray contours outside the 28@xmath120  inner shell of ngc3242 is most likely caused by the point - spread function ( psf ) of _ xmm - newton _ that is known to have a half energy width ( hew ) of 152 for epic - pn and 130 - 138 for epic - mos and significantly extended wings .",
    "the x - ray image and contours also suggest that the detailed morphology of the x - ray emission is asymmetric , with an emission peak northwest of the central star .",

    "these simulated observations demonstrate that the diffuse x - ray emission from ngc3242 is more consistent with that from a central cavity filled with x - ray - emitting gas than from a thin ellipsoidal shell .",

    "as the hot gas density is @xmath04@xmath51 @xmath44 ( @xmath73 kpc ) , we have plotted the hot gas density as a function of its inner shell radius @xmath72 in figure  [ prof : phys]-_left _ and the thermal pressure in figure  [ prof : phys]-_right_. the hot gas shell s inner radii corresponding to @xmath47 of 0.15 , 0.5 , and 0.8 are marked .",
    "it is apparent that the hot gas pressure exceeds that of the nebular shell only for small filling factor values , @xmath740.15 , thus requiring the hot gas to be concentrated in a thin shell with fractional thickness @xmath750.05 .",
    "the properties of the x - ray emission from ngc3242 , based on a preliminary analysis @xcite , were compared to 1d hydrodynamical models of pne that included the effects of stellar wind evolution and heat conduction by @xcite .",
    "they remarked that the round shape of the rim of the inner shell of ngc3242 makes it a suitable pn for the comparison with their 1d simulations .",
    "the revised values of different x - ray properties of ngc3242 presented here need to be discussed in the framework of @xcite s model .",
    "this revision mostly affects the values of the thermal pressure of the hot bubble and inner shell rim , whereas the x - ray luminosity ( scaled to the distance of 0.55 kpc ) and plasma temperature of ngc3242 are basically the same as those used by @xcite .",
    "we note that the models selected by @xcite have a thermal pressure of the hot bubble that exceeds that of the rim , while our revised values indicate the opposite , i.e. , the thermal pressure of the rim ( @xmath62=3.6@xmath110@xmath60 dyne  @xmath26 ) is higher than that of the bubble ( @xmath62=1.6@xmath110@xmath49 dyne  @xmath26 ) .",
    "one possible outcome to this issue would be a distance for ngc3242 much farther than 0.55 kpc @xcite ; at a distance of 3 kpc , the thermal pressures of the hot bubble and rim would be the same , but this would make ngc3242 too large ( @xmath76 pc ) and evolved ( @xmath77 yrs ) and we consider it to be unlikely .    the other possible solution is to consider a low value for the filling factor of the x - ray - emitting gas in the bubble ; a value @xmath47=0.15 would make both pressures the same .",
    "such a low filling factor is expected to produce a noticeable limb - brightening morphology that is not observed ( figures  [ ximg ] and [ prof ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sim_ximg ] , hints of a limb - brightened morphology are still apparent for a hot gas shell with a fractional thickness of 0.2 ( i.e. , @xmath78 ) even at the _ xmm - newton _ limited spatial resolution ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "it is arguable , however , that extinction has reduced the center - to - limb contrast of the x - ray emission , thus shifting the emission inwards , as this is an effect expected to be noticeable @xcite even for the small extinction ( @xmath24=5@xmath110@xmath25 @xmath26 ) towards the nebula .",
    "alternatively , we must consider the dynamical effects of the photo - ionization of the nebular material , which may have overcome those of the currently diminished stellar wind of ngc3242 @xcite . in this case , the nebular expansion is driven by the thermal pressure increase produced in the rim by photo - ionization .",
    "this may explain the relatively large thickness of ngc3242 inner shell rim , as compared to that of ngc6543 .",
    "we suggest that the rim thickness can be used as an indicator of the relative thermal pressure of hot gas and photo - ionized nebular material ; a sharp rim would imply that the thermal pressure of the hot gas is larger than this of the nebula , and thus that hot gas itself is present ( and detectable ) , while a thick inner shell rim would imply a lower pressure for the hot gas , if present .",
    "the low plasma temperature is puzzling in view of the enhanced n / o ratio of the x - ray - emitting plasma , about three times higher than the n / o ratio of the nebular material .",
    "such differences in the chemical abundances seem to imply that the x - ray - emitting plasma mostly consists of shocked stellar wind , with little contamination of material from the nebula .",
    "the low plasma temperature , however , needs large amounts of material from the cold nebular shell to have been incorporated into the hot bubble .",
    "this problem , similar to that found in other pne such as bd+303639 @xcite , ngc2392 @xcite , and ngc6543 @xcite , may require mechanisms for the production of x - ray emission in pne other than mixing and heat conduction as summarized by @xcite .",
    "there is , finally , a noticeable asymmetry of the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission from ngc3242 , with the northwestern half of the hot bubble being brighter than its southeastern half ( figures  [ ximg ] and [ prof ] ) .",
    "even if we assume that the inner shell of ngc3242 were a tilted ellipsoid with its northwestern tip moving towards us ( and its southeastern tip receding from us ) , it seems unlikely that an uneven spatial distribution of intervening material could be responsible of the observed asymmetry as it may be the case of the dusty pne bd+30@xmath213639 @xcite and ngc7027 @xcite , because only small extinction variations were observed in ngc3242 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , our simulations in section 3.1 suggest that the asymmetric distribution of x - ray emission could result from small number statistics .",
    "we have obtained _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observations of ngc3242 , a multiple - shell pn consisting of an inner shell with a bright , round rim , and an outer envelope .",
    "the observations have detected diffuse , soft x - ray emission confined within the innermost shell of ngc3242 .",
    "the relatively low temperature of the hot gas , @xmath80=2.35@xmath110@xmath2  k , compared to the expected adiabatic post - shock temperature of a stellar wind with a velocity of 2,400 km  s@xmath4 @xcite suggests that heat conduction has taken place .",
    "indeed , models including heat conduction provide a reasonable description of the x - ray temperature and luminosity of ngc3242 @xcite .",
    "however , the chemical abundances of the x - ray - emitting plasma are closer to the stellar values , suggesting little evaporation of cold nebular material into the hot bubble and thus contradicting the expectation of heat conduction .",
    "we have compared the physical properties ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath62 ) of the gas in the hot bubble with those of the gas at the inner shell rim .",
    "the inner shell can be described as a thin shell with a constant density of 2,200 @xmath44 and a thickness 15% its radius , while the envelope is best described by a shell whose density declines @xmath83",
    "r@xmath84 to r@xmath85 .",
    "the gas in the hot bubble has lower thermal pressure than the gas in the shell rim , unless the x - ray - emitting gas is mostly confined within a thin shell , which is not supported by the x - ray morphology observed .",
    "comparisons with simulations favor a large filling factor for the x - ray - emitting gas .",
    "we also note the asymmetric distribution of the x - ray emission within the inner shell of ngc3242 and found it unlikely to be a result of nonuniform absorption of the x - ray emission within the optical shell .",
    "x - ray observations at higher spatial resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( montez et al . , in preparation ) are needed to provide a sharper view of the distribution of the x - ray - emitting plasma within ngc3242 .",
