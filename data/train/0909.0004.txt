    "understanding how planets form has been an active topic of research for centuries , but interest in this subject has increased dramatically since the discovery of the first extra - solar planets @xcite . over 350 such planets",
    "are now known , with a diverse range of properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it was recognized very quickly that many extra - solar planets orbit very close to their parent stars , and that such planets could not have formed at their current locations .",
    "this in turn sparked renewed interest in the established theory of planet migration @xcite , in which planets form far from their parent stars and `` migrate '' to smaller radii through the action of tidal torques .",
    "the migration of low - mass planets remains controversial , but so - called type ii migration , which applies to planets sufficiently massive ( @xmath1m@xmath2 ) to open gaps in their parent gas disks , is now relatively well understood ( see , e.g. , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in a similar vein",
    ", it was discovered in the 1980s that young stars , such as the t tauri stars ( tts ) , possess circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these disks are of order a percent of the mass of their central star @xcite , and we now have a well - established evolutionary picture where disk - bearing , classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) evolve into disk - less , weak - lined t tauri stars ( wtts ) on timescales of a few myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dominant processes driving ( gas ) disk evolution are angular momentum transport , and evaporation due to heating by energetic photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these evolving `` protoplanetary '' disks are the sites of planet formation .",
    "statistically , it is clear that some fraction of observed protoplanetary disks must contain planets . identifying these planet - bearing disks",
    "is of considerable interest , since doing so would provide evidence as to where and when planets typically form within disks , and discriminate between different models for giant planet formation .",
    "unfortunately , although we have a reasonable idea of what a disk containing a planet would look like ( an ordinary disk at large radii , but depleted of gas and dust interior to the planet s orbit ) , we can not say that all the disks observed to show such signatures ( the so - called transitional disks ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contain planets .",
    "a significant fraction of transitional disks may instead represent an intermediate stage of disk evolution prior to final disk clearing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a process that occurs in the presence or absence of planets . here",
    ", we seek to construct models that include both disk evolution and planet formation . by comparing the models against both exoplanet and disk evolution statistics we seek to make maximum use of available observational constraints , and",
    "thereby predict the observational appearance of planets within evolving disks .    in this paper",
    "we present models of giant planet migration in evolving protoplanetary disks .",
    "we restrict ourselves to considering relatively massive planets , @xmath3m@xmath2 , primarily because searches for exoplanets are presently only complete to around the jupiter mass level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . consequently , throughout this paper the term `` planet '' always refers to gas giant planets ; we make no attempt to model planets of lower mass .",
    "our models include viscous transport of angular momentum , photoevaporation , and type ii planet migration .",
    "we adopt a monte carlo approach , running large numbers of models with a range of initial conditions in order to follow the time evolution of distributions of disk and planet properties . in ",
    "[ sec : models ] we present our numerical model , and compare the results to the observed radial distribution of extra - solar planets , and to a large range of observations of protoplanetary disks .",
    "our results compare favourably with the observed properties of both planets and disks , and we discuss how the observational data can constrain various properties of the model .",
    "this is the first study to model populations of transitional disks theoretically , and in  [ sec : trans ] we discuss the transition disk phenomenon .",
    "our relatively simple model reproduces the known properties of these objects well .",
    "the model produces transition disks via two different mechanisms ( gap - opening by planets and disk clearing ) , and we discuss the relative efficiency of these processes in the models .",
    "we show that observations of transition disk masses and accretion rates remain the most straightforward means of distinguishing between different types of transition disks , and make predictions for future observations of such objects .",
    "in our model , protoplanetary disks evolve due to viscous transport of angular momentum and photoevaporation by the central star .",
    "planets migrate due to tidal interaction with the disk ( in the type ii migration regime ) , and the disk is also subject to tidal torques from planets .",
    "the coupled evolution of a protoplanetary disk and a planet is described by the equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the first term on the right - hand side describes ordinary viscous evolution of the disk @xcite , and the @xmath11 term represents the mass - loss due to photoevaporation . the second term describes how the disk responds to the planetary torque : here @xmath12 is the rate of specific angular momentum transfer from the planet to the disk . following @xcite and @xcite , for a planet of mass @xmath13 at radius ( semi - major axis ) @xmath14 we adopt the following form for @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the disk scale - height .",

    "this transfer of angular momentum causes the planet to migrate at a rate @xmath19 this treatment of planet migration is necessarily idealized , but has previously been shown to give results comparable to more sophisticated numerical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the kinematic viscosity @xmath8 governs the transport of angular momentum in the disk , and we adopt an alpha - disk model @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the standard @xcite viscosity parameter and @xmath22 is the orbital frequency .",

    "the mass - loss profile is strongly concentrated close to the critical radius @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the `` gravitational radius '' defined by @xcite is found by equating the keplerian orbital speed with the sound speed of the ionized gas , @xmath37 . ] .",
    "the `` direct '' profile applies when the inner disk has been cleared ( by either viscous or tidal torques ) and is optically thin to ionizing photons . in this case",
    "stellar irradiation ionizes the inner edge of the disk directly , and the disk is cleared from the inside out @xcite .",
    "we make use of the numerical parametrizations given in the appendix of @xcite , and switch between the two profiles when the surface density in the inner disk ( @xmath38 ) falls below some critical value @xmath39 .",
    "we set @xmath40 g @xmath41 , but note that the results are not very sensitive to the exact value adopted ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "we assume a stellar ionizing flux of @xmath42photons per second ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which results in a ( diffuse ) wind rate of @xmath43m@xmath10yr@xmath30 .",
    "the initial surface density profile is taken from the similarity solution of the diffusion equation @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial disk mass .",
    "the scaling radius @xmath46 defines the initial disk size , and also sets the viscous time - scale of the disk .",
    "following @xcite we set @xmath47au , which results in a viscous time - scale of @xmath48yr for @xmath49 .",
    "we solve the diffusion equation for the gas surface density ( equation [ eq:1ddiff ] ) numerically using a standard first - order explicit finite difference scheme , on a grid of points equispaced in @xmath50 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we choose a grid covering the range @xmath51 $ ] , and adopt zero - torque boundary conditions ( i.e. ,  we set @xmath52 in the boundary cells ) . in the absence of a planet the gas disk can be evolved on a fairly coarse grid , but higher resolution is required to maintain accuracy when calculating the effect of the planetary torque . in order to make efficient use of computing resources we therefore use two resolutions : a low resolution with cell spacing @xmath53au@xmath54 and 1000 grid cells , and a high resolution with with @xmath55au@xmath54 and 4000 grid cells . in the absence of a planet",
    "the low resolution is used , but we switch to high resolution when a planet is present . switching to high resolution",
    "is achieved by simple linear interpolation , which is sufficient to conserve mass and angular momentum at very high accuracy .",
    "the time - step is typically limited by the radial velocity of the gas very close to the location of the planet , and evolving the system on such a short time - step is unnecessary after the planet has opened a gap in the disk .",
    "consequently we impose a maximum torque ( and therefore a maximum gas velocity in the radial direction ) of @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , we make no attempt to model the interaction of the planet with the inner edge of the gas disk ( which is truncated by the stellar magnetosphere ) , and simply remove planets when they migrate to radii @xmath57au .",
    "the cumulative numerical errors in the conservation of mass and angular momentum are typically @xmath58% over the lifetime of the model .",
    "the description of planetary migration above does not allow any material to flow across the gap in the disk induced by the presence of a planet .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the disk - planet interaction show that tidal streams of gas do flow across the gap , allowing accretion on to both the planet and the inner disk to persist after the gap has been opened ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rate of accretion on to the planet can be parametrized as the fraction @xmath59 of the disk accretion rate that would be measured in a steady disk in the absence of a planet .",
    "simulations show that the efficiency @xmath59 varies strongly with the mass of the planet , and can approach ( and even exceed ) unity for planets which are marginally able to open a gap in the disk @xcite .    .",
    "the lowest planet mass we consider in our models is 0.5m@xmath2 . ]",
    "fig.[fig : acc_eff ] shows values of @xmath59 obtained from two - dimensional numerical simulations of planets embedded in gaseous disks .",
    "simulations of low - mass and high - mass planets have been normalized by demanding consistency at @xmath60 , and further normalized so that the maximum value of the efficiency , @xmath61 , is equal to unity .",
    "in addition , we also show a simple fitting function which provides a good fit to the numerical results @xcite .",
    "the fitting function takes the form @xmath62 more recent numerical studies suggest that , in addition to allowing accretion on to the planet , tidal streams also permit accretion across the gap from the outer to the inner disk . following @xcite , we define the accretion rate across the gap to be @xmath63 where the accretion rate on to the planet is @xmath64 operationally , we compute the disk accretion rate expected in the absence of a planet , @xmath65 as the accretion rate at three times the radius of the planet : @xmath66 at each timestep we subtract a mass @xmath67 from the cell(s ) immediately outside the gap , and add the appropriate fractions of this mass to the planet and inner gap edge . for consistency with the results of @xcite we adopt @xmath68 , but note that our results are not very sensitive to the exact value of @xmath61 .",
    "this procedure does not explicitly conserve angular momentum , as mass is moved from larger to smaller radii without regard for the different angular momenta of these orbits .",
    "what should happen to this `` excess '' angular momentum is not clear @xcite , but tests show that if all of the excess angular momentum goes to the planet ( the extreme case ) , the migration rate is slowed only at the 12% level .",
    "this is smaller than many of the other uncertainties in the migration model , so we are satisfied that our planetary accretion procedure is robust .       and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "circles denote the model where accretion across the planet - induced gap is permitted ( @xmath70 ) ; crosses the model where no gas flows across the gap .",
    "the lines show the corresponding curves from @xcite , for both partially ( dotted ) and fully suppressed ( dashed ) migration models .",
    "the small discontinuities in the numerical data for the `` flow '' models at final radii @xmath71au occur when the planet triggers disk clearing , as discussed in the text .",
    "when gas does not flow across the gap this triggering is much more dramatic , and no planets survive at radii @xmath0au . ]    in order to test the accuracy of our numerical method , we performed a comparison with the semi - analytic results of @xcite . for this test",
    "we set the initial disk mass to be @xmath72m@xmath73m@xmath10 , and `` form '' planets of initial mass @xmath74m@xmath2  at @xmath75au .",
    "figure [ fig : a07_comp ] shows the final planet radii as a function of formation time , for disks with @xmath49 and @xmath69 and models with @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( i.e. , with and without accretion flow across the planet s orbit ) . also shown are the semi - analytic predictions of @xcite , with parameters adjusted to match the disk model used here , for both `` partially suppressed '' and `` fully suppressed '' models ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exceeds the local disk mass @xmath78 , as the planet s inertia then causes it to migrate on a time - scale longer than the local viscous time - scale .",
    "the degree of suppression is characterised by the parameter @xmath79 : for partial suppression the migration rate is reduced by a factor @xmath80 , while in the fully suppressed case it is reduced by a factor @xmath81 . ] . in both cases",
    "the numerical results agree very well with the predictions of the fully suppressed migration model , so we are satisfied that our numerical procedure is accurate .",
    "the fact that our models appear consistent with the fully suppressed migration model is not altogether surprising , because by allowing gas to flow across the gap we prevent the pile - up of material near the outer gap edge that drives systems into the partially suppressed regime .",
    "we also see from fig.[fig : a07_comp ] that the inclusion of the direct photoevaporative wind results in a degree of coupling between the formation of planets and the onset of disk clearing .",
    "if a planet suppresses accretion in the inner disk sufficiently , the resulting gap in the disk can become optically thin to ionizing photons . as a result the wind switches to the direct regime and clears the disk , preventing further planet migration ; effectively , the planet triggers disk clearing .",
    "this behaviour is distinct from that considered in previous models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which assumed that disk clearing was independent of planet formation and migration .",
    "when accretion across the gap is significant the consequences of this are not dramatic ( as seen in fig.[fig : a07_comp ] ) : the location of the small discontinuity in allowed final planet radii differs for different disk models , and when we assume a spread in disk initial conditions the discontinuity is not reflected in the resulting distribution of planet radii .",
    "however , when accretion across the gap is suppressed ( i.e. , for very low values of @xmath59 ) we see strong coupling between planet formation and disk clearing , with significant implications for the final distribution of planet semi - major axes . in this case",
    "planets can only survive if the outer edge of the gap they induce is outside the critical radius where photoevaporation opens a gap in the disk ( approximately 2au ) ; at smaller radii , the planet is always swept on to the star when the inner disk is cleared .",
    "consequently , planets can only survive at radii @xmath0au if there is an accretion flow across the gap .",
    "such planets are commonly observed , so we conclude that some accretion flow across planetary orbits must occur in real systems .      in order to study the effects of migration and accretion on the disk and planet properties , we run sets of models in which we randomly sample various model parameters .",
    "we first describe our reference model set , and then a number of further model sets in which we explore the effects of varying different parameters in the model .    in the reference model set the parameters of the disk model are fixed to the values described above , but we allow for a spread in initial disk masses .",
    "we use a log - normal distribution of initial disk masses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a mean of @xmath82 and a 3-@xmath83 spread of 0.5dex .",
    "in the absence of a planet the mean disk model has an initial accretion rate of @xmath84m@xmath10yr@xmath30 , starts to undergo photoevaporative clearing after a `` lifetime '' of @xmath85myr , and is completely cleared after @xmath86myr .    not all stars are observed to possess giant planets at au radii , so we form planets only in a subset of our models : the probability of a giant planet forming in each individual model is 10% ( this value chosen arbitrarily in order to reproduce the observed frequency of giant planets ) . in each model which forms a planet , we then allow a single planet of mass @xmath87 to `` form '' at time @xmath88 and radius @xmath89 . in the reference model",
    "set we use a constant planet formation radius of @xmath90au .",
    "we assign the initial planet masses by randomly sampling a distribution @xmath91 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , over the range 0.5m@xmath92m@xmath2 . here",
    "the lower limit of 0.5m@xmath2  is approximately the minimum gap - opening mass for our disk model , and the upper limit is chosen , somewhat arbitrarily , near the limit set by the most massive known extra - solar planets .",
    "the time of formation is assigned randomly in the range to 0.25myr @xmath93 .",
    "the lower limit represents the earliest time at which our disk model is physical ( see  [ sec : model ] above ) , and the upper limit is the time at which the wind begins to clear the gas disk . following @xcite and @xcite we define this time as @xmath94 in addition , we limit the maximum value of @xmath88 such that the planet mass can not exceed the instantaneous disk mass at @xmath88 . in practice , however , the wind begins to clear the gas disk when the disk mass reaches @xmath9510m@xmath2 , so this constraint only applies to the most massive planets .",

    "we follow the approach of @xcite in creating a uniformly - selected , complete sample of extra - solar planets , using the data from the lick radial velocity survey given in @xcite .",
    "these data are complete for doppler velocities @xmath97 m  s@xmath30 and orbital periods @xmath98yr .",
    "consequently , we apply cuts to the sample so that @xmath99m@xmath2  and @xmath100au .",
    "our model makes no attempt to model the survival of `` hot jupiters '' at small radii , so we also require that @xmath101au .",

    "in particular , we are able to follow the accretion rate on to the star ( i.e. , at the inner boundary ) and the disk fraction as functions of time , for our compete set of 1000 disk modes . the evolution of the accretion rate is shown in fig.[fig : mdot_time ] : the color scale denotes the probability of finding an individual disk at any given position in the @xmath121@xmath6 plane .",

    "there is also significant scatter in the evolution : the shortest disk lifetime is 2.3myr , while the longest is 10.7myr .",
    "much of this scatter is due to the intrinsic dispersion in our disk model , but the effects of migrating planets increase the scatter significantly compared to a disk - only model .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which identify disks through near- or mid - infrared excess emission ( which is suppressed or absent in both transitional disks and wtts ) .",
    "we see that the disk fraction declines from nearly 100% at @xmath130myr to almost zero at @xmath131myr , with a median disk lifetime of approximately 4myr .",
    "this behaviour agrees qualitatively with observational studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but for our purposes these binaries can be regarded as contaminants in photometric studies of disk fractions in young clusters . some nearby star - forming regions , such as taurus - auriga , have been the subject of detailed multiplicity surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but more distant and more heavily embedded regions have not been similarly studied .",

    "the suggestion that some young stars are born without disks poses serious questions of our understanding of star formation , but a simpler interpretation is that the majority of these `` disk - less '' objects are in fact binary or multiple systems .",
    "if we assume that 20% of young stars are binaries which do not show strong infrared excesses , then our model agrees very well with the observed data ( see fig.[fig : disc_frac ] ) .",
    "we do not reproduce the long tail of the distribution observed in some older clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we expect giant planets to form over a range of radii , so we also considered sets of models where @xmath89 was assigned randomly in the ranges 2au@xmath139au and 5au@xmath140au .",
    "in addition , we consider three other variant model sets : one with @xmath141 ; one with @xmath69 ; and one with the scale radius @xmath142 assigned randomly in the range 5au@xmath143au .",

    "the resulting distributions of planet radii unfortunately do not discriminate significantly between the various models .",
    "ks tests fail to reject any of the models which allow for a range of initial planet masses ( probabilities in the range 0.515% ) , and on this basis none of these models are strongly preferred ( or disfavoured ) with respect to the reference model .",
    "the frequencies of surviving planets vary only weakly between the models , and given that this depends primarily on the input planet formation frequency this also fails to constrain on the model parameters significantly .",
    "the low - viscosity ( alpha ) and high disk mass ( diskmass ) models are somewhat disfavoured due to their long disk lifetimes ( mean disk lifetimes of 7.4 & 9.8myr respectively ) , but given the intrinsic uncertainties in our understanding of angular momentum transport in disks this is also not especially significant .",
    "similarly , the scale model , in which the disk scale radius @xmath142 varies , is weakly preferred over the reference model , due to the increased dispersion in the resulting disk lifetimes and accretion rates ( see fig.[fig : mdot_time ] ) .",
    "allowing for ranges in planet formation radii does not significantly alter the distribution of planets in the `` migration zone '' ( @xmath145au ) , but does give rise to significant differences in the distribution of planets at larger radii ( @xmath14610au ) .",
    "when the radial velocity surveys for planets become complete to larger radii ( longer orbital periods ) , they will provide stronger constraints on the radii at which giant planets form ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the one model which is strongly rejected is that in which planets form with a fixed mass of 0.5m@xmath2  ( model fixedmass ) . in this model dispersion in planet masses",
    "is solely due to differences in the accretion history of planets during the migration phase , and consequently the final planet masses correlate strongly with radius .",
    "planets which spend a longer time migrating accrete more gas , so the most massive planets are always found at small radii ; such a correlation is not observed in exoplanet surveys .",
    "moreover , planetary accretion is not fast enough to account for the observed range in planet masses : the most massive surviving planets have masses of @xmath147m@xmath2 .",
    "we are therefore able to reject this model at high confidence , and conclude that giant planets must enter the type ii migration regime with a large range of masses .",
    "a critical feature of our migration model is the maximum time at which planets are allowed to form , @xmath148 .",
    "planets which form at late times are only able to migrate a limited distance before the disk is cleared ( see fig.[fig : a07_comp ] ) , so the latest time at which planets can form has important implications for the resulting distribution of planets , especially close to the formation radius @xmath89 .",
    "variations in @xmath148 do not strongly affect the distribution of planets in the reference model at radii @xmath145au , but changing @xmath148 by as little as 10% can result in 3-@xmath83 changes in the distribution at larger radii .",
    "we therefore attach limited significance to our predicted distributions of planets in the range @xmath34310au .",
    "however , we note that even the formation of the observed population of giant planets ( in the migration zone ) requires planets to form at relatively late times , @xmath14912myr ( see fig.[fig : a07_comp ] ) .",
    "this result is predicated on the assumption that protoplanetary disks accrete in a manner consistent with our viscous accretion model .",
    "adopting lower values of @xmath21 reduces the efficiency of type ii migration somewhat , but one can not adopt arbitrarily low values and still reproduce the observed accretion rates . as long as disks are accreting viscously at the observed rates , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that giant planets must be able to form late . at these times",
    "the disk masses in our models are low , @xmath150m@xmath10 , with surface densities at 510au of @xmath151 g @xmath41 .",
    "this is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the surface density in the canonical minimum mass solar nebula @xcite , which is treated as a fiducial value in many calculations of planet formation .",
    "forming planets in disks with such low surface densities may be challenging for modern theories of planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a further limitation of our models is that we consider only the formation of one planet per disk , while in reality many planetary systems contain multiple planets . in such systems planet - planet interactions",
    "can be important , and can modify the extra - solar planet distribution after the dispersal of the gas disk .",
    "indeed , it seems likely that planet - planet scattering is responsible for the observed distribution of exoplanet eccentricities @xcite . in this scenario",
    "many planets in the migration zone undergo additional migration after the gas disk is cleared , and this process causes the innermost planet to migrate by an amount that depends , on average , on the number of giant planets present at the end of the disk lifetime . if this number is typically small ( 23 ) scattering will result in a modest re - mapping of our planet distributions to smaller radii , but will not remove the need for the distribution of planets at small semi - major axes to be primarily established through disk migration .",
    "the shape of the distribution would also change if the scattering properties are not scale - free in radius .",
    "considering these effects would be necessary in precision tests of data against theory , but is not warranted with the limited suitable data samples available at present .",
    "since their discovery by @xcite , the so - called `` transitional disks '' have been thought to represent a crucial step in the evolution of planet - forming disks around young stars .",
    "these disks are characterized by reduced emission in the infrared but longer wavelength emission consistent with normal ctt disks , and this is generally attributed to some degree of inner disk clearing .",
    "the fraction of disks which appear transitional is small , typically 510% @xcite , which leads to the conclusion that the transitional phase is short - lived @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this also means that the sample of well - studied transitional disks is small , and this small sample shows considerable diversity in disk properties .",
    "a detailed understanding of this important phase of disk evolution has thus so far remained elusive ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    theoretically , a number of different physical processes are expected to give rise to disks with `` transitional '' spectral energy distributions : planets @xcite , dust evolution @xcite , disk clearing @xcite and the presence of companions @xcite probably all play a role .",
    "however , recent observational studies , especially those with the _ spitzer space telescope _ , have led to a dramatic increase in the number of known transitional disks , resulting in the first demographic studies of their properties .",
    "@xcite identified a sample of 12 transitional disks in the taurus - auriga cloud , using 530@xmath152 m data from the _ spitzer _ spectroscopic survey of @xcite .",
    "all of the 8 single stars in their sample are actively accreting , but the accretion rates for the transitional disks were found to be , on average , an order of magnitude lower than for ctts with similar disk masses .",
    "@xcite concluded that partial inner disk clearing by embedded planets was the most probable explanation for this result , but noted that other explanations ( notably dust settling or growth ) could not be ruled out .",
    "by contrast , @xcite identified a sample of 26 transitional disks in a number of nearby star - forming clouds , using different selection criteria based on observations across a wider range in wavelengths .",
    "they found that inner disk clearing was associated with significant depletion of the ( outer ) disk mass , and concluded that disk evolution ( presumably due to viscosity and/or photoevaporation ) was the most probable explanation .",
    "these contrasting results suggest that selection biases still dominate these relatively small samples , but also suggest that more than one physical mechanism is responsible for the systems that are broadly classed as `` transitional '' .",
    "this view is further supported by the recent results of @xcite , who used observations of co emission lines to divide a sample of 14 transition disks into `` cleared '' and `` partially depleted '' inner disks .",
    "a key issue in such studies is how transitional disks are defined .",
    "a broad definition , such as that used by @xcite , encompasses settled dust disks , disks where significant grain growth has occurred , disks with inner holes , disks with embedded planets , and some binaries .",
    "a more strict definition , such as that proposed by @xcite , limits the sample to objects with partially or fully cleared inner holes , and thus only selects objects whose gas disks have undergone significant evolution or perturbation . in our models",
    "we can identify , and distinguish , two different types of `` transitional '' disk : disks with holes or gaps due to embedded planets , and disks which are being cleared ( through the combined action of viscosity , photoevaporation , and possibly planetary torques ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a planet which opens a gap in a disk reduces the dust - to - gas ratio in the inner disk , resulting in a corresponding suppression of infrared emission .",
    "as we only consider planets which are massive enough to open such a gap , all planet - bearing disks in our models are likely to be identified as transitional .",
    "in addition , any disk which has evolved to be optically thin in the inner disk at infrared wavelengths but remains optically thick at larger radii ( i.e. , any disk undergoing inside - out clearing ) is likely to be classed as transitional .",
    "consequently , in our models we identify disks as transitional if    @xmath153 g  @xmath41 and @xmath154 g  @xmath41    or    the disk contains a planet .    note , however , that disks identified in this manner represent only a subset of the observed samples of transitional disks , which are generally more broadly defined ( as discussed above and in  [ sec : discussion ] ) .    in our models",
    "the disks are able to spread to arbitrarily large radii , and many of our disks expand to radii of order 1000au .",
    "however , such large disks are not commonly observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in reality the outer edges of disks are likely to be truncated by a variety of different physical processes ( such as photoevaporation by non - ionizing radiation , or tidal interactions with other stars ) .",
    "this simplification does not have a strong effect on the global evolution of our models , but does cause problems in defining when disks have been cleared .",
    "we define all disks which have inner holes larger than some critical radius @xmath155 to be `` cleared '' .",
    "initially we adopt @xmath156au , but we also investigate the effect of varying this parameter on our results .    for clarity we define the following quantities in each set of models , which vary as functions of time :    * the total number of stars ( always 1000 in our models ) . * the number of stars with normal , non - planet - bearing disks , analogous to the number of ctts ( or class ii sources ) . * the number of stars with transitional disks ( according to the above criteria ) . * the number of stars with planet - bearing disks .",
    "these represent a subset of the more broadly - defined transitional disks .",
    "( note that stars with planets but no disk are classified as disk - less . ) * the number of stars with disks cleared to beyond @xmath155 , analogous to the number of wtts ( or class iii sources ) .    by construction , @xmath157 . we note in passing that the term transitional is rather misleading in this context , as many of our disks evolve from a `` transitional '' , planet - bearing phase back into a normal ctt phase before they are finally cleared .      by adopting the definitions above , we are able to identify a subset of transitional disks in our model sets that is broadly consistent with observationally - defined samples of transitional disks .",
    "the fraction of transitional disks ( @xmath128 ) in the reference model varies from 013% , as seen in fig.[fig : disc_frac ] . varying the value of @xmath155 has only a small effect on this result : for @xmath158au the peak transition disk fraction is 10% , while for @xmath159au it rises to 17% .",
    "the transition fraction is initially small , rises to a peak at approximately the median disk lifetime , and then declines .",
    "the increase in the transition disk fraction with time can be understood in terms of the increasing migration time - scale ( due to increased suppression of migration with declining disk mass ) , and also the increasing incidence of clearing discs at later times ; the decline at late times is imposed by overall decrease number in the number of disk - bearing systems .",
    "however , some aspects of the shape of this curve are artefacts of our model : in particular , the lack of transition disks at early times is in part due to the fact that we do not form any planets at @xmath160myr .",

    "as the population evolves photoevaporation becomes important for a progressively larger fraction of disks , so the number of clearing disks increases and the ratio @xmath161 declines . here",
    "the time - scale of @xmath163myr is simply the point at which the first of our disks ( those with the lowest initial masses ) reach the low , @xmath164m@xmath10yr@xmath30  accretion rates where photoevaporation becomes important .",
    "the absolute time - scales in our model are set by the disk viscosity and initial conditions , which are essentially free parameters chosen to match the observed constraints on disk evolution ( as discussed in section  [ sec : ref_model ] ) .",
    "we choose these parameters such that the median disk lifetime is @xmath1654myr , and the time at which the first clearing disks appear is determined by the dispersion in disk lifetimes . in the reference model set this",

    "these results suggest that younger transitional disks may be the most promising candidates for hosting embedded planets ( at least in a statistical sense ) .",

    "this `` transition fraction '' is small , but as the total disk fraction declines @xmath170 increases to around 30% , and approaches unity at very late times ( when only a handful of disks remain , most of which are clearing ) .",
    "in addition , the small denominator causes this ratio to become highly stochastic at last times .",
    "we stress that this behavior is not inconsistent with the rapid disk clearing seen in our models ( as claimed by , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is instead a natural consequence of a rapid transition in a population of stars with a plausible dispersion in disk lifetime . in addition , we note that our models somewhat under - estimate the fraction of transitional disks , as we do not consider processes , such as dust settling or terrestrial planet formation , that may lead to the appearance of `` homologously depleted '' transitional disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . consequently at late times , when only a few disks remain , many , if not most of them will be transitional .",
    "we therefore urge against using the ratio @xmath170 ( or , similarly , @xmath171 ) as a measure of the transition disk fraction , especially in clusters older than a few myr ( where the disk fraction @xmath172 is small ) .",

    "we predict the existence of two populations of transitional disks : weakly accreting disks , which contain embedded planets , and non - accreting disks which are undergoing inside - out clearing . at early times ( @xmath162myr ) essentially all transitional disks are planet - bearing , but the fraction of transition disks which possess planets drops with time ; at late times ( @xmath184myr ) , the vast majority of transitional disks are being cleared by photoevaporation .",
    "future observations will result in much larger samples of transitional disks than are currently known , and should allow us to disentangle the competing processes of disk evolution and planet formation .",
