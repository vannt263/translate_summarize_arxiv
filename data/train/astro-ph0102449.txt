    "carbon chains play a central role in the chemistry and spectroscopy of interstellar space .",
    "the detection of cyanopolyacetylenes in dense interstellar clouds @xcite led to the suggestion by @xcite that carbon chain species be considered as candidates for the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , which are found in the 4000 - 8500 spectral region of stars reddened by interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "since then , many other molecules with a carbon chain backbone have been identified at radio frequencies in dense clouds @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , advances in laboratory measurements have provided an understanding of the types and sizes of carbon chains which have strong electronic transitions in the dib range @xcite .",
    "it is thus somewhat surprising that as yet among the bare carbon species only diatomic c@xmath11 has been identified in interstellar clouds where dib are detected .",
    "the 4052 electronic band system of c@xmath0 was first detected in comets @xcite and then in circumstellar shells by infrared spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "most recently c@xmath0 was identified in a dense cloud using sub - mm measurements of its low frequency bending mode and n@xmath12(c@xmath0)@xmath13 @xmath7 was estimated @xcite .",
    "@xcite established an upper limit of 5@xmath1410@xmath15 @xmath7 for the column density of c@xmath0 in the direction of @xmath2 oph , some two orders of magnitude lower than that set by @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a tentative detection of c@xmath0 towards an eighth magnitude star in the same part of the sky , hd 147889 , at a column density of 4@xmath1410@xmath16 @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , the star turned out to be a ( previously unknown ) double - lined spectroscopic binary which limited their sensitivity .",
    "this letter presents the detection of c@xmath0 towards three stars and infers the column densities in the diffuse clouds .",
    "although c@xmath17 , c@xmath18 and c@xmath19 were not detected , upper limits for their column densities are estimated .",
    "diatomic species , such as ch , cn , c@xmath11 , and ch@xmath20 , have been detected towards two of the stars chosen and their column densities are considered standards with which to compare models for the physical and chemical processes in diffuse regions @xcite . the four bare carbon chains , c@xmath0 , c@xmath17 , c@xmath18 and c@xmath19 , were selected for the present search because gas phase electronic transitions for these species have been identified in the laboratory in the 4000 - 5500 region and their oscillator strengths are known ( see table [ results ] ) .",
    "observations of the reddened stars @xmath2 oph ( hd 149757 ) , @xmath2 per ( hd 24398 ) and 20 aql ( hd 179406 ) were made with the gecko echellette spectrograph on 2000 july 16 and 19 , fiber fed from the cassegrain focus of the canada - france - hawaii 3.6-m telescope ( cfht ) @xcite .",
    "all three stars have a visual extinction , a@xmath21 , near 1 and were chosen because they are bright with sharp interstellar k i lines indicating either single clouds or little doppler distortion ( in the case of @xmath2 oph , @xcite resolved the c@xmath11 at 8756  into two close velocity components separated by 1.1 km s@xmath22 ) .",
    "the detector was a rear illuminated eev1 ccd ( 13.5 @xmath23m@xmath24 pixels ) and the spectral regions were centered at 4047  in the 14th order , and at 5060  and 5400  in the 11th and 10th orders , respectively .",
    "the ultraviolet gecko prism was used to isolate the 14th order , the blue grism for the 11th order , while the stock cfht filter # 1515 was used for the 10th order observations .",
    "individual spectra had exposure times ranging from 5 to 20 minutes and were obtained with continuous fiber agitation to overcome modal noise .",
    "the resulting combined spectra for the individual stars at each wavelength had unusually high signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n@xmath5800 - 4000 ) for ccd observations .",
    "the th / ar comparison arc spectra , taken before and after each spectrograph wavelength reconfiguration , had a typical fwhm of 2.8 pixels , which corresponds to resolutions of @xmath25 = 121000 , 113000 and 101000 at 4047 , 5060 and 5400  , respectively .",
    "processing of the spectra was conventional .",
    "groups of biases were taken several times throughout each night and at each grating setting a series of flat - field spectra of a quartz - iodide lamp were recorded .",
    "the biases and appropriate flats were averaged and used to remove the zero - level offset and pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations of the ccd .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted using standard iraf routines .",
    "spectra of vega and other unreddened stars were used to search for contaminating telluric water vapor lines and stellar photospheric features .",
    "heliocentric corrections were applied to each spectrum .",
    "the observations are summarised in table [ observations ] which lists exposure times and s / n per pixel for each spectral region .",
    "the final column gives the radial velocities measured from the interstellar k i 4044.1 and 4047.2  lines .",
    "these velocities have been applied to each spectrum to put the interstellar features on a laboratory scale .",
    "the @xmath3 origin band of c@xmath0 is quite clearly detected towards all three stars .",
    "figure [ figure1 ] compares the observed spectra with a simulated c@xmath0 absorption spectrum based on the spectrograph resolution and assuming a boltzmann distribution in the ground state rotational levels with a temperature of 80 k. the continuum noise level in the observations is @xmath50.1 % .",
    "low order polynomials have been applied to the stellar data to give a level continuum ( base line ) and , in the case of @xmath2 per , a weak , broad stellar feature at 4053.2 has been removed .",
    "residual broad features in the final spectra are only a few tenths of a percent deep , much less than in the original , and they in no way mask the sharp c@xmath0 lines . in the simulation the rotational line intensities were calculated using the hnl - london factors , while the line positions were taken from the laboratory measurements ( this avoids the problem of a perturbation affecting the low @xmath4 ground state levels which is not accounted for by the fitted spectroscopic constants ) .",
    "the individual rotational p , q and r lines are clearly resolved in the spectra of all three stars .",
    "table [ lines ] lists the observed positions and equivalent widths of each rotational line assigned in the spectra of the three stars .",
    "the table also gives the corresponding positions measured for these transitions in the laboratory ( gausset et al .",
    "the positions of some 30 lines in the spectrum of @xmath2 oph agree with the laboratory data to within 0.1 cm@xmath22 providing an unambiguous identification of c@xmath0 in these diffuse clouds .",
    "figures [ figurec2p ] , [ figurec2 m ] , and [ figurec3 m ] show the results of equivalent searches for @xmath27 origin band of c@xmath17 at 5078.1 ( @xmath2 oph only ) , the @xmath28 origin band of c@xmath18 at 5415.9 and the @xmath29 origin band of c@xmath19 at 4040.4 , together with simulated spectra for these transitions at 80 k based upon the published spectroscopic constants ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the cases of c@xmath30 and",
    "c@xmath31 the linewidth was assumed to be determined by the spectrograph resolution .",
    "for c@xmath32 the excited state has been identified as a short - lived feshbach resonance and the measured natural linewidth of @xmath51 cm@xmath22 is employed in the simulation .",
    "weak telluric lines were been removed from the c@xmath17 and c@xmath18 observations using standard procedures .    unlike the 4050 region for c@xmath0 , each of these spectral regions is contaminated by weak stellar features .",
    "nonetheless , for the c@xmath17 and c@xmath18 ions , there are no sharp features corresponding to the rotational lines in the simulations .",
    "on the other hand , for c@xmath32 there are features in the spectrum of @xmath2 per and ( much less convincing ) in the magnified plot for @xmath2 oph which appear to coincide in position and shape with the simulated band heads .",
    "it is unlikely that these are due to c@xmath32 because the stellar lines in @xmath2 per have exactly the same shape as the coincident features . for @xmath2",
    "oph the whole c@xmath32 spectrum sits within a weak stellar feature ( the lines are broadened by rapid rotation @xmath5400 km s@xmath22 ) .",
    "the photospheric lines in @xmath2 oph show nonradial pulsation ` ripples ' which will be washed out to some extent by the long exposure time employed .",
    "the spectrum of 20 aql , which normally has the strongest interstellar lines of the three , is free of stellar features but has no features coincident with the c@xmath32 simulation .",
    "it is concluded that , while interstellar c@xmath32 might be absent for 20 aql and present for the other two stars , it is more likely that in the latter cases the features are instead stellar .",
    "table [ results ] gives the measured equivalent widths for the most intense c@xmath0 line ( q(8 ) ) for each star together with an 1@xmath33 error estimate .",
    "for c@xmath17 , c@xmath18 and c@xmath19 , 3@xmath33 detection limits are given .",
    "the 1@xmath33 level errors and detection limits are derived from :      where the 1@xmath33 limiting equivalent width , @xmath35 , and the fwhm of the feature , @xmath36 , are both measured in  , the spectrograph dispersion , @xmath37 , in  pixel@xmath22 , and s / n is the signal to noise per pixel . from the simulations , @xmath36 = 0.045 , 1.0 , 0.13 and 0.045 for c@xmath0 , c@xmath19 , c@xmath17 and c@xmath18 , respectively .    in the case of c@xmath0 , equivalent widths , @xmath35 ,",
    "were determined for each rotational line ( varying between 0.3 - 2.7@xmath38 ) and , in combination with the transition oscillator strength , f@xmath39 , and hnl - london factors , the column densities , @xmath40(c@xmath0 ) , of each rotational level ( @xmath4 ) in the ground electronic state were calculated @xcite . in cases where several rotational lines originating from the same level were assigned ( e.g. p(8 ) ,",
    "q(8 ) , r(8 ) ) the mean of the determined column densities was taken .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] shows a boltzmann plot of ln(@xmath41 ) vs. the rotational energy @xcite where the slope is inversely proportional to the rotational temperature . among the lowest rotational levels ( @xmath4214 )",
    "the populations are reasonably approximated by a distribution at 50 - 70 k , whereas the higher rotational levels correspond to a temperature of 200 - 300 k. the simulation in figure 1 uses 80 k as this represents an average temperature for the entire rotational population and allows both the high and low @xmath4 lines to be identified .",
    "the high temperature component of the distribution is apparent in the astronomical spectra where the r band head and the higher q lines are more intense than in the simulation ( figure 1 ) .",
    "@xcite also found a bimodal population distribution for c@xmath11 in diffuse clouds , with similar characteristic temperatures for the low and high @xmath4 values .",
    "the lower temperature is interpreted as the kinetic energy of the cloud and for both c@xmath11 and c@xmath0 the values obtained are comparable to those used in models of diffuse clouds @xcite . the higher temperature component is attributed to repopulation of the levels in the ground electronic state by radiative pumping from excited states . in the case of c@xmath0",
    "it is expected that both the @xmath43 state and the higher lying @xmath44 state will contribute to the radiative pumping .",
    "the sensitivity of these measurements is such that @xmath40(c@xmath0 ) in the range 0.2 - 2@xmath45 @xmath7 is determined for rotational levels up to @xmath4=30 .",
    "the @xmath40 values were summed to give the estimated lower limits in the range 1 - 2@xmath6 @xmath7 for the total column density , @xmath46(c@xmath0 ) , in table [ results ] .      a previous search for c@xmath0 in the direction of @xmath2 oph did not identify the molecule @xcite .",
    "it is unclear why this was the case as , in the light of the present observations , the signal - to - noise quoted for these measurements was adequate and the upper limit given was some thirty times lower than the column density reported here .",
    "the present measurements for the column densities of c@xmath0 are of the same order of magnitude as the tentative estimate for a translucent cloud @xcite and can be compared to those of other polyatomic molecules observed in diffuse interstellar clouds .",
    "column densities ( also towards @xmath2 oph ) in the 10@xmath47 @xmath7 range have been inferred for hco@xmath20 , c@xmath11h and c@xmath0h@xmath11 from observations in the mm region by @xcite , while h@xmath48 has been identified in diffuse regions and n@xmath12(h@xmath48 ) estimated @xmath49 @xmath7 by @xcite .",
    "column densities of c@xmath11 towards @xmath2 oph and @xmath2 per have been determined in the 2 - 3@xmath50 @xmath7 range by @xcite .",
    "a current model of the diffuse clouds by @xcite predicts n@xmath51(c@xmath11)/n@xmath12(c@xmath0 ) @xmath5 20 ( on a 10@xmath52 year time scale ) , implying n@xmath12(c@xmath0)@xmath53 @xmath7 , in agreement with the values deduced from the table [ results ] . the main production route to c@xmath0 is presumed to be the dissociative recombination process : c@xmath0h@xmath20 + @xmath54 @xmath55 c@xmath0 + h , where c@xmath0h@xmath20 is produced from smaller species by c@xmath20 ion insertion . under conditions",
    "where ultra - violet radiation penetrates , photodissociation of c@xmath0 takes place at a threshold of 1653 . as the strong @xmath44@xmath56@xmath57 electronic transition of c@xmath0",
    "is predicted to occur around 1700 @xcite , the dissociation process , c@xmath0",
    "@xmath55 c@xmath11 + c , may be an important destruction pathway in diffuse clouds .",
    "although only upper limits for the column densities of c@xmath19 , c@xmath17 and c@xmath18 could be presently established , these species are of interest as small ionic carbon fragments play a crucial role in the ion  molecule schemes for diffuse cloud chemistry @xcite .",
    "the c@xmath17 ion is the only bare carbon cation for which the gas phase electronic spectrum is known @xcite . in diffuse clouds",
    "it is supposed to be the product of the fundamental step : c@xmath20 + ch @xmath55 c@xmath17 + h. its main destruction mechanism is hydrogenation : c@xmath17 + h@xmath11 @xmath55 c@xmath11h@xmath20 + h , which dominates over recombination with electrons in diffuse regions .",
    "the diffuse cloud model @xcite predicts a c@xmath17 abundance a factor of 10@xmath58 lower than c@xmath11 , implying a column density @xmath59 @xmath7 , in accord with the upper limit in table [ results ]",
    ".    published models for diffuse regions do not include the smallest pure carbon anions , c@xmath18 and c@xmath19 in their reaction libraries .",
    "unlike c@xmath17 , c@xmath18 does not react with h@xmath11 so its main destruction mechanism is expected to be photodetachment .",
    "the similar rotational line widths and oscillator strengths of the c@xmath18 and c@xmath17 transitions lead to similar upper limits for their total column densities .",
    "the width of the unresolved bands for c@xmath19 and the presence of weak stellar features in this spectral region means that a higher column density of this ion could have escaped detection .",
    "the detection of c@xmath0 provides a powerful incentive for the laboratory study of the electronic transitions of longer carbon chains in the gas phase with the aim of comparison with dib data .",
    "the question as to what types and sizes of carbon chains will have strong transitions in the 4000 - 9000 range has already been answered : for example , @xmath44@xmath56@xmath57 transitions of the odd - number bare chains , c@xmath60 , @xmath61=8 - 30 @xcite .",
    "the existence of linear carbon chains up to c@xmath62 has been confirmed by the observation of their electronic spectra in neon matrices @xcite . as the oscillator strength scales almost linearly with the length of the molecule",
    ", one can expect f@xmath6310 - 20 for these carbon chains .",
    "with such an oscillator strength , a species with a column density @xmath64 @xmath7 would be enough to give rise to a strong dib , with an equivalent width of 1 . in view of the column density @xmath510@xmath16 @xmath7 for c@xmath0 determined in this work for three diffuse clouds",
    ", this appears to be a reasonable expectation .    the support of the swiss national science foundation ( project no . 20 - 055285.98 ) , the canadian natural sciences and engineering research council and the national research council of canada is gratefully acknowledged .",
