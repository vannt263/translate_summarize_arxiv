    "furthermore , in corollary  [ corollary : no - exotic - fillings ] , we show that the above proof can be easily extended to the case of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms ; hence there are no exotic symplectic fillings as asserted .",
    "we provide an explicit algorithm for identifying a given milnor fiber as a minimal symplectic filling , that is , as complements @xmath30 . for this",

    "christophersen @xcite , and in particular we answer the question raised in nemethi  popescu - pampu  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as we classified minimal symplectic fillings of quotient surface singularities up to diffeomorphism , the above explicit identification of milnor fibers induces the classification of milnor fibers up to diffeomorphism as follows :    the milnor fibers associated to irreducible components of the reduced semi - universal deformation space of a quotient surface singularity are non - diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "the question is that , for a given minimal symplectic filling , there is a milnor fiber which is diffeomorphic to the minimal symplectic filling .",
    "for cyclic quotient surface singularities , ohta and ono  @xcite proved that a minimal symplectic filling of an @xmath36-singularity is diffeomorphic to its milnor fiber .",
    "then nmethi and popescu - pampu  @xcite showed that every minimal symplectic filling of a cyclic quotient surface singularity is diffeomorphic to a milnor fiber of the singularity , and they provided an explicit one - to - one correspondence between milnor fibers and minimal symplectic fillings .",
    "we briefly review related results . as mentioned above , minimal symplectic fillings of a cyclic quotient surface singularity of type @xmath37 are parametrized by lisca by the set @xmath40 of certain sequences of integers @xmath41 . on the other hand christophersen",
    "@xcite , stevens  @xcite , and de jong and van straten  @xcite parametrized by the same set @xmath40 ( but with different methods ) the reduced irreducible components of the versal deformation space of @xmath1 . since each component contains a smoothing because @xmath1 is a rational singularity , the diffeomorphism types of milnor fibers are invariants of irreducible components of the versal deformation space of the singularity @xmath1 .",
    "hence milnor fibers of @xmath1 are also parametrized by the same set @xmath40 .",
    "so lisca  @xcite raised the following conjecture : the milnor fiber of the irreducible component of the reduced versal base space of the cyclic quotient surface singularity @xmath1 parametrized by @xmath43 is diffeomorphic to @xmath42 .",

    "for non - cyclic quotient surface singularities , ohta and ono  @xcite showed that any minimal symplectic fillings of non - cyclic ade singularities ( i.e. , @xmath44 singularities ) are diffeomorphic to their milnor fibers .",
    "however , the correspondence between milnor fibers and minimal symplectic fillings of the other non - cyclic quotient singularites remained widely open .",
    "all possible minimal symplectic fillings of non - cyclic quotient surface singularity were found by bhupal ",

    "hence it would be natural to raise the question : is there a one - to - one correspondence between milnor fibers and minimal symplectic fillings also for non - cyclic quotient surface singularities ?",
    "since a milnor fiber is a minimal symplectic filling , the question is if every minimal symplectic filling can be realized as a milnor fiber .",
    "we give an affirmative answer in section  [ section : minimal - symplectic - fillings - are - milnor - fibers ] .",

    "ono  @xcite , every minimal symplectic filling of a quotient surface singularity is symplectic deformation equivalent to the complement of the compactifying divisor @xmath31 in a certain rational complex surface @xmath33 .",
    "there are complete lists in lisca  @xcite and bhupal ",
    "ono  @xcite of @xmath79 corresponding to minimal symplectic fillings .",
    "we show that , for each pair @xmath79 in these lists , the divisor @xmath31 supports an ample divisor @xmath86 in @xmath33 .",
    "so there is an embedding of @xmath33 into a projective space @xmath87 by the linear series @xmath88 for some @xmath89 .",
    "taking the affine cone @xmath90 over @xmath33 , it follows by proposition  [ proposition : supporting - ample - divisor ] ( essentially by pinkham  ( * ? ? ?",

    "see also ssw  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  8.1 ) and fowler  ( * ? ? ?",
