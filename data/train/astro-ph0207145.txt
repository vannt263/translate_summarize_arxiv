    "several clusters of galaxies show extended ( @xmath0 mpc size ) synchrotron emission not directly associated with the galaxies but rather diffused into the intracluster medium ( icm ) : these radio sources are called radio halos . in some cooling flow clusters with a central dominant galaxy , the diffuse radio emission is extended on a smaller scale , forming the so  called _ mini  halos _ ( feretti & giovannini 1996 ) .",

    "time of an ensemble of relativistic electrons losing energy by synchrotron emission and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering off the cmb photons is given by @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the magnetic field intensity ( in g ) , @xmath3 is the lorentz factor and @xmath4 g . in a cooling flow region ( i.e. for distances @xmath5 , the cooling radius ) the compression of the thermal icm",
    "is expected to produce a significant increase of the strength of the frozen  in intracluster magnetic field : @xmath6 for radial compression ( soker & sarazin 1990 ) or @xmath7 for isotropic compression ( tribble 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , in absence of a reacceleration or continuous injection mechanisms , relativistic electrons injected at a given time in these intense fields ( of order of some tens of @xmath8 g , e.g. ge & owen 1993 ) should already have lost most of their energy and the radio emission would not be observable for more than @xmath9 yr .",
    "this short lifetime contrasts with the diffuse radio emission observed in mini ",
    "halos , hence it seems plausible that the electrons have been reaccelerated .",
    "the time evolution of the energy of a relativistic electron is determined by the competing processes of losses and reaccelerations ( both related to the magnetic field ) and it is important to study the efficiency of these processes in the cooling flow region as a function of @xmath10 ( isotropic compression of the field is assumed ) : @xmath11 \\\\",
    "\\dot{\\gamma}_{+}&=&+ \\alpha_+ \\gamma \\ , = f(x ) \\ , \\gamma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the coefficient of synchrotron and ic losses , @xmath13 the coulomb losses term , @xmath14 the reacceleration coefficient , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the electron number density at @xmath17 . since the characteristic time of radiative losses is proportional to @xmath18 ,",
    "while that of reacceleration is independent of @xmath3 , the losses dominate the time evolution of the electrons for energies higher than @xmath19 , the break energy ( fig . 1 , left panel ) . in our model ( gitti , brunetti & setti 2002 )",
    "we assume that the relativistic electrons are continuosly reaccelerated by mhd turbulence _ via _ fermi - like processes .",
    "this kind of reacceleration has the correct radial dependence on the parameters in the cooling flow region to naturally balance the radial behaviour of the radiative losses ( fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "the stationary spectrum of the relativistic electrons is : @xmath20 which is essentially peaked at @xmath19 and where we have parameterized the electron energy density as @xmath21 , @xmath22 being a free parameter .",
    "the other free parameters in the model are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the leading mhd turbulence scale at @xmath17 .",
    "the first observed and well studied case of radio mini - halo is that in the perseus cluster ( a426 , at @xmath25 ) , which hosts also a massive cooling flow . the diffuse radio emission ( see left panel in fig .",
    "2 ) has a total extension of @xmath26 ( comparable with that of the cooling flow region , @xmath27 kpc ) , a steep spectrum with spectral index @xmath28 ( between 327 mhz and 609 mhz , @xmath29 ) and its morphology is correlated with that of the cooling flow x - ray map ( ettori et al .",
    "1998 ) . on smaller scales ( @xmath30 ) , bhringer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed evidence of interaction between the radio lobes of the central radiogalaxy 3c84 and the x  ray emitting intracluster gas .",
    "more recent results confirmed this interaction ( fig .",
    "2 , right panel ) and support the interpretation of the holes in the x  ray emission as due to buoyant old radio lobes ( fabian et al .",
    "we notice that the spectral index in the lobes ranges from @xmath31 in the centre to @xmath32 in the outer regions of fig .",
    "2 ( right panel ) , i.e. a value similar to the spectrum of the mini  halo extended over a scale @xmath33 times larger .",
    "thus it is impossible to find a direct connection between the radio lobes and the mini ",
    "halo in terms of simple particle diffusion or buoyancy .",
    "the relativistic electrons of the mini ",
    "halo should then be reaccelerated and the morphological connection with the cooling flow suggests a leading role of the cooling flow itself in powering the reacceleration process .",
    "+ therefore , we have applied our model to the perseus cluster , whose radio properties ( brightness profile , integrated spectrum and radial spectral steepening ) can be well reproduced assuming isotropic compression of the field ( gitti et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this case",
    ", the necessary energy rate to reaccelerate the relic population of electrons in a typical time of few @xmath34 yr is @xmath35 erg s@xmath36 , while the energy rate supplied by the cooling flow is of the order of @xmath37 erg s@xmath36 , so only a small fraction of it is required .",
    "the number of relativistic electrons in the cooling flow region is @xmath38 .",
    "this is comparable to the number of the electrons in a typical radiogalaxy and may suggest an important role of the agns ( and possibly of the central agn ) in the injecton of the electron relic population .",
    "in the framework of our model , large  scale turbulence in the cluster volume is required to balance the radiative losses of the electrons at @xmath17 ( for perseus we found @xmath39 ) , however at the same time the turbulence can not be too high in order to avoid the disruption of the cooling flow .",
    "this scenario is similar to that of the extended radio halos where , however , higher energy electrons ( with @xmath40 ) are required ( e.g. brunetti et al . 2001 ) : this means that the turbulence efficiency would have to be correspondingly greater hence bringing to the disruption of a possible cooling flow , in agreement with the observed anti - correlation between radio halos and cooling flows .",
    "+ based on these considerations , we suggest that the physical conditions of the icm in a cooling flow cluster with a radio mini  halo are intermediate between those which lead to the formation of extended radio halos , hosted by clusters without cooling flows , and those holding in cooling flows clusters without radio halos .",
    "this could explain , at least qualitatively , the rarity of radio mini  halos . in this scenario , where the energetics of the turbulence plays the main part in discriminating between the two opposite situations",
    ", perseus may represent a borderline case : indeed there is evidence for a relatively recent merger event ( dupke & bregman 2001 ) which may have left a fossil turbulence , not energetic enough to produce an extended radio halo , but sufficient for reaccelerating the electrons producing the mini  halo .",
    "in order to extend the application of our model , we have undertaken the analysis of a2626 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this cluster has a radio emission extended on a scale comparable to that of the cooling flow region ( e.g. rizza et al . 2000 ) , and thus it is one of the best mini  halo candidates .",
    "+ we present preliminary results for this cluster , obtained from vla archive data at 1.5 ghz and 330 mhz at different resolutions .",
    "the 1.5 ghz map ( fig .",
    "3 , left panel ) shows an unresolved core ( with a flux density @xmath42 mjy , in agreement with roland et al .",
    "1985 ) and a diffuse emission extended by @xmath43 ( @xmath44 mjy ) ; we have estimated a polarization level @xmath45 % . at 330 mhz we do not detect the emission of the core ( for which we extimated an inverted spectral index @xmath46 ) while the flux density of the diffuse emission is @xmath47 jy . the spectral index of the diffuse emission between @xmath48 mhz and @xmath49 ghz is @xmath50 .",
    "these results indicate that the radio source observed in a2626 shows an amorphous structure which is likely to be not related to the central radiogalaxy .",
    "thus it appears as a good candidate to apply our model for electron reacceleration in cooling flows . in fig .",
