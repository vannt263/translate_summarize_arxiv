    "in this paper we consider two problems over permutations .",
    "our main problem of interest is the _ quadratic assignment problem _ ( qap ) , a well studied hard combinatorial optimization problem , introduced by koopmans and beckman @xcite in 1957 as a mathematical model for the location of indivisible economic activities . in the problem @xmath0",
    ", we are given @xmath3 facilities , @xmath3 locations , a _ flow matrix _",
    "@xmath1 whose entry @xmath4 represents the flow of activity between two facilities @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and a _ distance matrix _",
    "@xmath2 whose entry @xmath7 represents the distance between the locations @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "then the objective is to find an assignment of the facilities to the locations , i.e. , a permutation @xmath8 of the set @xmath9=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] , minimizing the total cost of the assignment .",
    "that is , solve the following optimization problem over all permutations @xmath8 of @xmath9 $ ] : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the cost inferred by assigning facility @xmath5 to location @xmath12 and facility @xmath6 to location @xmath13 .",
    "qap has been extensively studied in the past decades , in particular due to its many real world applications .",
    "we refer e.g. to @xcite and references therein for an exhaustive survey .",
    "qap is an np - hard problem and it can not even be approximated within a constant factor @xcite .",
    "however , there exist many special cases which are solvable in polynomial time by exploiting the structure of the data .",
    "specifically , we are interested in those  easy cases \" where an optimal solution is known in explicit form and is represented by a _ fixed _ permutation .",
    "these cases have a practical importance in designing heuristics , approximation and enumeration algorithms and they occur when the matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 have an specific ordered structure , like being monge , toeplitz or monotone matrices ( see @xcite , @xcite for a survey and the recent works @xcite ) . for instance , if @xmath1 is monotonically nondecreasing ( i.e. , if both its rows and columns are nondecreasing ) and @xmath2 is monotonically nonincreasing ( i.e. , if both its rows and columns are nonincreasing ) , then it is known that the identity permutation is an optimal solution to @xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 8.23 ) .",
    "another instance of @xmath0 for which the identity permutation is optimal arises when @xmath1 is a kalmanson matrix , i.e. , @xmath1 is symmetric and satisfies : @xmath14 and @xmath2 is a symmetric circulant matrix ( i.e. , @xmath7 depends only on @xmath15 modulo @xmath3 ) with decreasing generating function ( i.e. , with @xmath16 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) .",
    "this extends an earlier result of kalmanson @xcite when @xmath2 is the adjacency matrix of the cycle @xmath17 , in which case @xmath0 models the shortest hamitonian cycle problem on the distance matrix  @xmath1 .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to provide a new class of qap instances that admit a closed form optimal solution .",
    "these instances arise when both matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 have a special ordered structure related to the so - called seriation problem , which is our second problem of interest and is described below .    the _ seriation problem _ asks ( roughly ) to linearly order a set of objects in such a way that similar objects are close to each other and dissimilar objects are far apart .",
    "this classical problem was introduced by robinson @xcite in 1951 for reconstructing the chronology of archeological graves from information about their similarities . beside archeological dating @xcite the seriation problem has applications in many other areas including biology @xcite , machine learning @xcite , scheduling @xcite and sparse matrix reordering @xcite .",
    "a more exhaustive list of applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , an @xmath18 symmetric matrix @xmath1 is called a _ robinson similarity _ matrix if its entries decrease monotonically in the rows and the columns when moving away from the main diagonal , i.e. , if @xmath19 given a symmetric matrix @xmath20 , the seriation problem asks to find a simultaneous reodering of its rows and columns , i.e. , a permutation @xmath8 of @xmath9 $ ] , so that the permuted matrix @xmath21 is a robinson similarity .",
    "if such a permutation exists then @xmath1 is said to be a _",
    "robinsonian similarity_. analogously a symmetric matrix @xmath2 is called a _ robinson dissimilarity matrix _ if its entries increase monotonically in the rows and columns when moving away from the main diagonal , i.e. , if @xmath22 is a robinson similarity ; @xmath2 is then a _ robinsonian dissimilarity _ if @xmath22 is a robinsonian similarity .",
    "note that the @xmath23 robinsonian similarity matrices are exactly the symmetric matrices with the well known _",
    "consecutive ones property_. recall that a matrix @xmath24 is a toeplitz matrix if it has constant entries along its diagonals , i.e. , if @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .    our main result in this paper",
    "can then be formulated as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath1 is a robinson similarity , @xmath2 is a robinson dissimilarity and that one of the two matrices @xmath1 or @xmath2 is a toeplitz matrix .",
    "then the identity permutation is an optimal solution for problem @xmath0 ( theorem  [ theomain2 ] ) . from this",
    "we derive a more general result when both matrices are robinsonian ( corollary  [ theomain3 ] ) .",
    "hence our result uncovers an interesting connection between qap and the seriation problem and introduces a new class of qap instances which is solvable in polynomial time .",
    "our result can be seen as an analogue for symmetric matrices of the above mentioned result about qap for monotone matrices , where we replace the monotonicity property by the robinson property ( which implies unimodal rows and columns ) .",
    "moreover our result extends two previously known cases .",
    "the first case is when the robinson similarity @xmath1 is a combination of ( special ) cut matrices and the robinson dissimilarity @xmath2 is the toeplitz matrix @xmath27 , considered in @xcite .",
    "this case ( which in fact has motivated our work ) is discussed in section [ sec2sum ] below ( see proposition [ prep : rcut - matrices ] ) .",
    "the second class of instances ( which was pointed out to us by a referee ) is when the similarity matrix @xmath1 is the adjacency matrix of the path @xmath28 ( thus toeplitz ) , and @xmath2 is a robinson dissimilarity which is metric ( i.e. , @xmath29 $ ] ) and strongly monotone ( i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for all @xmath32 . ) then ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 10 ) shows that @xmath0 is easily solvable , which also follows from our main result .",
    "interestingly the above class of strongly monotone robinson dissimilarity metrics plays a central role in the recognition algorithm of @xcite for matrices that are permutation equivalent to kalmanson matrices .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as it follows . in section  [ sec2sum ]",
    "we introduce the seriation problem and discuss some known algorithms to solve it in polynomial time , and we also discuss links to the 2-sum problem and other instances of qap .",
    "section 3 contains the main result of the paper and in section 4 we present some applications of it leading to new instances of polynomially solvable qap s .      throughout , @xmath33 is the set of permutations of @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath34 is the set of symmetric @xmath18 matrices and @xmath35 is the all - ones matrix . for @xmath36 , @xmath37 denotes the usual trace inner product on @xmath38 . for @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "set @xmath41 . for @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", we have : @xmath44    since @xmath1 is a robinson dissimilarity if @xmath45 is a robinson similarity , we often refer to @xmath1 as a robinson matrix if @xmath1 or @xmath45 is a robinson similarity matrix . clearly , the all - ones matrix @xmath35 is both a similarity and a dissimilarity robinson matrix and thus adding any multiple of @xmath35 preserves the robinson property",
    "therefore , for a robinson matrix @xmath1 , we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath1 is entrywise nonnegative .",
    "we may also assume without loss of generality that all diagonal entries are equal in a robinson similarity and all diagonal entries are equal to 0 in a robinson dissimilarity . on the other hand , observe that when dealing with @xmath0 , if one of the two matrices has zero diagonal entries , then the diagonal entries of the other matrix do not play a role .",
    "given a set of @xmath3 objects to order and a similarity matrix @xmath20 which represents the pairwise correlations between the objects , a _ consistent ordering _ of the objects is a permutation @xmath8 of @xmath9 $ ] for which the permuted matrix @xmath46 is a robinson similarity , i.e. , satisfies the linear constraints ( [ eqr ] ) .",
    "the seriation problem consists in finding ( it they exist ) all possible consistent orderings of the objects .",
    "it is straightforward to verify whether a given matrix @xmath47 is a robinson similarity .",
    "moreover one can decide in polynomial time whether @xmath1 is robinsonian and if so construct all consistent reorderings .",
    "mirkin and rodin first introduced in 1984 an @xmath48 algorithm to recognize robinsonian similarities .",
    "later , chepoi and fichet @xcite and seston @xcite improved the algorithm to respectively @xmath49 and @xmath50 and , very recently , prea and fortin @xcite presented an @xmath51 algorithm .",
    "these algorithms apply to recognize robinsonian dissimilarities and thus also robinson similarities as discussed above .",
    "they are based on a characterization of robinsonian matrices in terms of interval hypergraphs @xcite .",
    "a completely different approach to recognize robinsonian similarities was used by atkins et al .",
    "@xcite , who introduced an interesting spectral sequencing algorithm . given a matrix @xmath40 , its",
    "_ laplacian matrix _ is the matrix @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the all - ones vector and @xmath54 is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal is given by the vector @xmath55 . if @xmath56 then @xmath57 is positive semidefinite and thus its smallest eigenvalue is @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , the second smallest eigenvalue @xmath59 is positive if @xmath1 is irreducible .",
    "fiedler vector _",
    "@xmath60 of @xmath1 is the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue @xmath59 of @xmath57 , which is also known as the _ fiedler value_. the spectral algorithm of atkins et al .",
    "@xcite relies on the following properties of the fiedler vector of a robinson similarity matrix .",
    "@xcite [ prep : atkins r - matrices ] if @xmath61 is a robinson similarity then it has a monotone fiedler vector @xmath62 , i.e. , satisfying : @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite[prep : atkins fiedler vector ] assume that @xmath61 is a robinsonian similarity , that its fiedler value is simple and that the fiedler vector @xmath62 has no repeated entries .",
    "let @xmath8 be the permutation induced by sorting monotonically the values of @xmath62 ( in increasing or decreasing order ) .",
    "then the matrix @xmath46 is a robinson similarity matrix .    in other words ,",
    "the above results show that sorting monotonically the fiedler vector @xmath62 reorders @xmath1 as a robinson similarity .",
    "the complexity of the algorithm of @xcite in the general case is given by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the complexity of computing ( approximately ) eigenvalues of an @xmath18 symmetric matrix .",
    "barnard et al .",
    "@xcite had earlier used the same spectral algorithm to solve the 2-sum problem .",
    "given a matrix @xmath47 , the 2-sum problem is the special instance @xmath0 of qap , where the distance matrix is @xmath67 .",
    "that is , @xmath68 the authors of @xcite show that 2-sum is an np - complete problem and they use the above spectral method of reordering the fiedler vector of @xmath1 to produce a heuristic solution for problem ( [ 2-sum ] ) .",
    "this in turn permits to bound important matrix structural parameters , like envelope - size and bandwidth . however , no assumption is made on the structure of the matrix @xmath1 . as observed in  @xcite , the following fact",
    "can be used to motivate the spectral approach for 2-sum .",
    "if we define the vectors @xmath69 for @xmath70 , then @xmath71 and thus computing the fiedler value arises as a natural continuous relaxation for the 2-sum problem ( [ 2-sum ] ) .",
    "fogel et al .",
    "@xcite point out an interesting connection between the seriation and 2-sum problems .",
    "they consider a special class of robinson similarity matrices for which they can show that the identity permutation is optimal for the 2-sum problem ( [ 2-sum ] ) . namely they consider the following _ cut matrices _ : given two integers @xmath72 , the _ cut matrix _",
    "@xmath73 is the symmetric @xmath18 matrix with @xmath74-th entry 1 if @xmath75 and 0 otherwise .",
    "clearly each cut matrix is a robinson similarity and thus conic combinations of cut matrices as well .",
    "the following result is shown in @xcite , for which we give a short proof .",
    "@xcite[propfogel ] [ prep : rcut - matrices ] if @xmath40 can be written as a conic combination of cut matrices , then the identity permutation is optimal for the 2-sum problem ( [ 2-sum ] ) . more generally if , for some @xmath70 , @xmath46 can be written as a conic combination of cut matrices , then @xmath8 is optimal for the 2-sum problem ( [ 2-sum ] ) .",
    "first we show the result when @xmath1 is a cut matrix .",
    "say , @xmath76 and set @xmath77 .",
    "then , we need to show that * @xmath78 * for any permutation @xmath70 .",
    "suppose that @xmath8 maps the elements of the interval @xmath79 $ ] to the elements of the set @xmath80 , ordered as @xmath81 . because the left - hand side of the above inequality involves all pairs of indices in the interval @xmath79 $ ] , equivalently , we need to show that @xmath82 now the latter easily follows from the fact that @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "hence we have shown that the identity permutation is an optimal solution of problem ( [ 2-sum ] ) when @xmath1 is a cut matrix and this easily implies that this also holds when @xmath1 is a conic combination of cut matrices .",
    "the second statement follows as a direct consequence .",
    "in other words , the above result shows that for similarity matrices as in proposition [ prep : rcut - matrices ] , any permutation reordering @xmath1 as a robinson matrix also solves ( [ 2-sum ] ) . as",
    "not every robinson similarity is a conic combination of cut matrices , this raises the question whether the above result extends to the case when @xmath1 is an arbitrary robinson similarity matrix .",
    "there is a second possible way in which one may want to generalize the result of proposition [ propfogel ] .",
    "indeed , the 2-sum problem ( [ 2-sum ] ) is the instance of @xmath0 , where the distance matrix is @xmath85 , which turns out to be a toeplitz dissimilarity robinson matrix .",
    "in fact there are many other interesting classes of qap whose distance matrix @xmath2 is a toeplitz robinson dissimilarity matrix .",
    "for instance , @xmath0 models the minimum linear arrangement ( aka 1-sum ) problem when @xmath86 and , more generally , the @xmath87-sum problem when we have @xmath88 ( for @xmath89 ) , and @xmath0 models the minimum bandwith problem when @xmath1 is the adjacency matrix of a graph and @xmath2 is of the form @xmath90 , as defined in relation ( [ eqbdelta ] ) below . for more details on these and other",
    "graph ( matrix ) layout problems with pratical impact we refer to the survey @xcite and references therein .",
    "this thus raises the further question whether the result of proposition [ propfogel ] extends to instances of @xmath0 , where @xmath2 is an arbitrary toeplitz dissimilarity matrix .",
    "this is precisely what we do in this paper .",
    "we remove both assumptions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 and show that the identity permutation is optimal for @xmath0 when @xmath1 is any robinson similarity and @xmath2 is any robinson dissimilarity , assuming that @xmath2 ( or @xmath1 ) has a toeplitz structure .",
    "let @xmath1 be a robinson similarity matrix and let @xmath2 be a toeplitz robinson dissimilarity matrix .",
    "the first key ( easy ) observation is that we can decompose @xmath2 as a conic combination of 0/1 toeplitz robinson dissimilarities . given an integer @xmath91 $ ] , we define the symmetric matrix @xmath92 with entries @xmath93 note that for @xmath94 , we have that @xmath95 . clearly , each matrix @xmath90 is a toeplitz matrix and a robinson dissimilarity .",

    "our main result , which we show in this section , is that the identity permutation is optimal for @xmath105 for any integer @xmath106 .",
    "we will mention its application to @xmath0 in section [ secapplication ] .",

    "that is : @xmath110 then we can reformulate the inner products in ( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath111    @xmath112    and ( [ eq1 ] ) is equivalent to the following inequality : @xmath113 we show the inequality ( [ eq2 ] ) using induction on @xmath114 .",
