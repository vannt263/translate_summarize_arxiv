    "we can apply some of the results obtained to estimate the asymptotic behavior of the exponential series equation ( [ eqn20 ] ) when the argument @xmath3 approaches large values .",

    "we would need more terms for the approximation to possibly beat the simple exponential function .",
    "however , that is not justified since the new terms will increase complexity too much .      to select the lowest powers in @xmath3 we pick up the left - slanted diagonals @xmath124 ( see figure [ fig : diagonals ] ) @xmath125 @xmath126 again , higher terms become awkward to evaluate by guessing from the triangle and the general expression is @xmath127 thus @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath124 refers always to the same power @xmath41 of @xmath3 . in order to estimate the behavior",
    "when @xmath3 approaches zero , we may take the terms @xmath130 and @xmath131 to our expressions since they are with the lowest powers .",
    "this case is much more complicated than the preceding one as the series will always start to diverge while approaching the limit .",
    "the question is only , how does it do it ?",
    "the exponential series is @xmath132    @xmath133    the sum will diverge rapidly while @xmath3 approaches zero .",
    "the main term is the unity and the other terms will be big too but of opposite signs . at this end of the range",
    ", we have much more trouble in obtaining a simple approximating function for the generalized exponential function .",
    "since this approach fails , the analysis must be carried out in another way to obtain an asymptotic function near zero .",
    "we are able to investigate the behavior at small @xmath3 in the case of @xmath134 since we can solve the simple series as follows @xmath135 taking the limit of @xmath3 approaching zero shows that the result is a simple pole .",
    "we are not with the liberty of claiming that this would be valid for other values of @xmath4 .",
    "the exponential series and its generalized version having a power of the index @xmath4 , appeared to be a hard nut to be opened .",
    "our aim was to transform the generalized exponential series , to a form with a simpler functional dependence of the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we first decomposed the series by making it a series of nested exponents and restructured it into nested series instead .",
    "we recognized the new form by applying an exponential cauchy - euler differential operator .",
    "this allowed further transformation of the innermost power series to become a polynomial .",
    "this could , on the other hand , be understood as a series of powers of a differential operator acting on an exponential function .",
    "this series was formally identified as the riemann zeta function with an argument @xmath136 , simplifying presentation .",
    "the original series was converted into a nested series of polynomials in @xmath3 , allowing a simplification for further analysis .",

    "those are expressed in the appendices and some results are also in the main text .",
    "the recursion relations for the polynomial were solved , equations ( [ eqn2060 ] ) , ( [ eqn2260 ] ) and ( [ eqn2270 ] ) . with the aid of them",
    ", we presented a self - contained expression for the polynomial , equation ( [ eqn2310 ] ) which can be used for further analysis of the generalized exponential series .",
    "the polynomial can be simply solved by hand with the aid of a triangle as in equations ( [ eqn2000 ] ) , ( [ eqn2010 ] ) and ( [ eqn2050 ] ) .",
    "the generating function for the polynomial is a central tool for unwrapping the properties of the polynomial , equation ( [ eqn2100 ] ) .",
    "it is based on the first recursion relation ( [ eqn2060 ] ) .",
    "some new series expressions for the common exponential function and for the two basic trigonometric functions are in appendix [ apx : appd ] .",
    "they were derived with the aid of the generating function .",
    "we made a change of variable to the generating function forcing it to become symmetric with respect to the two parameters , equation ( [ eqn2102 ] ) .",
    "this is a series of two multiplying functions where the two parameters are separated and can be swapped on both sides .",
    "this led to some new interesting series expressions shown in appendix [ apx : appd ] .",
    "one of our motives was to better understand the asymptotic behavior at large variable values and also near zero .",
    "we tested whether the transformed series can offer a satisfactory approximation .",
    "it appeared that for large @xmath3 by using a few dominant terms of the new series , it fails to give a better asymptotic estimate than the traditional single - term approximation ( @xmath137 ) .",
