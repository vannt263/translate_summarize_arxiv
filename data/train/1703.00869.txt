    "in the past few decades , the study of interfaces between novel materials including metals , semiconductors , superconductors , topological insulators and layered materials harboring charge density waves ( cdws ) has generated the emergence of unexpected phenomena .",
    "these discoveries require a new understanding of underlying mechanisms which in turn may well lead to promising new technologies .",
    "the proximity effect at the superconducting / normal ( s / n ) boundary posits a leakage of cooper pairs into the normal metal accompanied by the appearance of superconductivity at the interface and extending into the metal@xcite .",
    "specifically , detailed study of s / n proximity junctions provides a unique probe of the pairing interaction of both conventional@xcite and unconventional@xcite superconductors .",
    "the reflection of an electron in n as a hole of opposite wave vector ( andreev reflections ) and propagation of paired quasiparticles in s gives rise to phenomena including contact - dependent excess conductance , reduced energy gaps and lower transition temperatures on both sides of the interface .",
    "van der waals ( vdw ) interfaces advantageously reduce concerns about epitaxial matching across the interface and have already been studied using ultra - smooth cleavable superconductors such as : bi-2212 in contact with the topological insulators , bi@xmath5se@xmath6 and bi@xmath5te@xmath6@xcite , 2h - nbse@xmath5 in contact with bi@xmath5se@xmath6@xcite and 2h - nbse@xmath5 in contact with graphene@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are motivated by the question of how coexistence , competition or cooperation of superconductivity with various collective electronic states , in particular charge density wave ordered states , can be studied using the proximity effect .",
    "this question has been discussed in systems of reduced dimensionality which are prone to electronic instabilities , such as the _ coexistence _ of cdw order and superconductivity in 2h - nbse@xmath1@xcite in contrast to the _ competition _ of cdw order and superconductivity in , for example , yttrium cuprate@xcite .",
    "the quasi - two dimensional layered transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) , many of which harbor cdw order , have served as model systems for the investigation of the interplay between cdws and low @xmath4 superconductivity where proximity - induced low-@xmath4 superconductivity can be achieved by the application of pressure@xcite to pristine 1t - tas@xmath5 or by partial substitution of se for s@xcite , fe for ta@xcite or electric - field gate controlled intercalation of li@xcite and is always associated with the more conducting nearly commensurate cdw ( nccdw ) phase and even the higher temperature incommensurate cdw ( iccdw ) phase .",
    "interestingly in the pressure experiments on the pristine 1t - tas@xmath5 the low-@xmath4 superconductivity ( @xmath7 5k ) persists when the pressure is high enough to convert the cdw phase to a metal@xcite .",
    "the tmd , 1t - tas@xmath1 , is a particularly interesting cdw material for such studies because it exhibits a pronounced first order cdw transition with hysteretic resistance transitions in the @xmath8k temperature range .",
    "it is generally recognized that electron  electron as well as electron  phonon interactions in 1t - tas@xmath1@xcite are responsible for the evolution of a nearly commensurate cdw ( nccdw ) to a mott commensurate cdw ( ccdw ) phase dominating at low temperatures .",
    "two opposing arguments focus on where and how low @xmath4 superconductivity forms in 1t - tas@xmath1 .",
    "the first argues that the superconductivity is formed within the metallic interdomain spaces separating the ccdw domains where tens of `` star of david '' clusters clump into rough hexagonal domains reproducing the mott - ccdw phase locally@xcite .",
    "the second argues that the superconductivity , characterized by a shallow electron pocket at the brillouin - zone center , is formed exactly within the clusters of stars@xcite in the nccdw phase in real space .",
    "we note that low-@xmath4 superconductivity at ambient pressure is only found in non - pristine ( i.e. , doped ) 1t - tas@xmath5 where the nccdw phase dominates .    in this study , we find evidence for proximity - induced high-@xmath0 superconductivity in the topmost layers of 1t - tas@xmath1 at the interface of van der waals bonded bi-2212/1t - tas@xmath1 junctions , where pristine bi-2212 is the high-@xmath0 superconductor bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath9 with a transition temperature @xmath10  k and intrinsic energy gap @xmath11  mev .",
    "andreev reflection , marked by excess current and a wide zero - bias conductance peak , is observed at temperatures up to 80  k where the 1t - tas@xmath1 is in the mott - ccdw state .",
    "the proximity induced gap @xmath12 in the 1t - tas@xmath5 is found to be a surprisingly large 20mev , thereby implying a strong coupling limit ( @xmath13 ) instead of the bcs weak coupling limit of 3.5 .",
    "in addition to the induced gap in the 1t - tas@xmath5 , we also observe a depressed gap compared to the intrinsic gap @xmath14 in the vicinity of the interface on the bi-2212 side .",
    "our observation of a transparency - dependent superconducting proximity effect of bi-2212/1t - tas@xmath1 junctions strongly indicates that superconductivity is induced in a metallic phase of 1t - tas@xmath1 .",
    "the transparency is defined as a dimensionless normal conductance , @xmath15 , where the parameter z is extracted from theoretical fitting of conductance spectroscopy data using the extended btk model described below .",
    "the puzzle here is that at the temperatures where bi-2212 is superconducting , the stoichiometrically pure 1t - tas@xmath5 is in the nonmetallic mott - ccdw state and a proximity effect should not be observed .",
    "the resolution of this puzzle is found in evidence for a metastable metallic phase , induced by voltage pulses , laser pulses or current excitations , residing within the mott - ccdw phase .",
    "this metastable state is ascribed to the reduction of onsite coulomb interaction @xmath16 and increase of hubbard band width @xmath17 via phase shifts of the cdw order parameter or interplay between the electron  electron and electron  phonon interactions in the topmost layers@xcite .    the superconducting proximity effect , attributed to the leakage of cooper pairs into a conducting metallic phase of the 1t - tas@xmath1 , is also confirmed by the good agreement of our _ c_-axis conductance spectroscopy @xmath18@xmath19 ) with an extended btk model for _",

    "this picture is incomplete however without comparing the energy of the second feature referenced to the intrinsic gap , @xmath92 and alternatively referenced to the reduced gap at the interface , @xmath86 , using the relation @xmath93 , revealing a slightly larger energy scale than @xmath94 both of which are derived from @xmath95 . for junction 1 - 3 these three boson modes , @xmath43 , @xmath54 and @xmath96 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure5](d ) as a function of temperature .    here",
    ", we provisionally assume the two dip  hump structures in conductance spectroscopies , observed in junction-13 , are due to self energy effects related to electron - boson interaction where phonons serve as the relevant bosons .",
    "we then infer that the `` glue '' assisting the strong - coupled pairing of electrons responsible for the high-@xmath0 superconductivity in 1t - tas@xmath1 arises from phonons .",
    "the key point , here , is whether the additional hump peaked at @xmath42 is the hump corresponding to the suppressed superconducting gap @xmath31 because of a boson mode energy @xmath97 representing the difference between the junction interface and bulk bi-2212 , or a hump related to intrinsic superconducting gap @xmath14 due to a boson mode energy @xmath54 incorporating the effect of interplay between electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions in 1t - tas@xmath1 on the density of states .",
    "for all junctions , the boson mode energy @xmath43 at low temperatures is within the range of 40mev to 60mev ( as indicated by grey background ) as well as being less temperature dependent .",
    "the results are consistent with the stm spectrum on intrinsic bi-2212@xcite .",
    "the yellow background demarcates the possible reduction ( @xmath304mev@xcite ) due to the substitution of @xmath98o by @xmath99o in bi-2212 crystals .",
    "slightly lower energy @xmath97 relative to @xmath43 is observed in all junction 13 . on the other hand ,",
    "all junctions reveal a nearly temperature - independent boson mode energy @xmath54 around 25mev indicated by the horizontal black dashed line ( except junction-2 over limited temperatures ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath54 is in good agreement with the energy scale of an observed  25mev infrared optical phonon@xcite corresponding to a cdw near the same energy@xcite that provides insight into the disorder ",
    "induced quasimetallic phase of 1t - tas@xmath1 residing in the mott - ccdw phase . additionally , the observed evolution of broader ( junction-12 as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) to sharper ( junction-3 as seen in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) line - shape of the hump peaked at @xmath42 is consistent with current evidence and explanations of the transition from a mott - insulating to a metallic phase in 1t - tas@xmath1 due to reduced coulomb interaction @xmath16 and broadened band width @xmath17 of lower hubbard band@xcite .    in conclusion , we have used differential conductance spectroscopy of bi-2212/1t - tas@xmath5 junctions with varying transparencies to find high-@xmath4 superconductivity induced within pristine 1t - tas@xmath5 by the proximity effect .",
    "the cdw order in the 1t - tas@xmath5 appears to play an important role firstly by coexisting with an unexpected and surprisingly high @xmath4 of the proximity gap in the 1t - tas@xmath5 and secondly by revealing a heretofore unseen ancillary dip - hump feature that accompanies a primary dip - hump feature corresponding to a boson ( phonon ) mode @xmath43 previously seen in stm work on intrinsic bi-2212 .",
    "this second dip - hump feature is clearly related to the proximity of the cdw dominated 1t - tas@xmath5 and implies one of two possible boson modes depending on whether the dip - hump feature is referenced to the reduced gap @xmath86 or the intrinsic gap @xmath90 at the interface . in the former case the temperature - dependent boson mode @xmath100 has values in the range 30 - 45 mev , somewhat less than the 40 - 50 mev range shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5](c ) for @xmath43 .",
    "the energy @xmath96 can probably be interpreted as the mode relating to the gap @xmath86 in the same manner as the mode @xmath43 is related to the intrinsic gap @xmath90 . in the latter case however the temperature dependent boson mode @xmath101 has values in the range 20 - 25 mev which is close to the infrared active phonon mode associated with the cdw in 1t - tas@xmath5 as measured by infrared reflectance@xcite .",
    "this more plausible latter interpretation provides independent evidence that the phonon associated with the ccdw phase coexists with and may even enhance the superconductivity in pristine 1t - tas@xmath5 .",
    "however , both of the above scenarios describing the second dip  hump structure provide reasonable rationales for the occurrence of a high-@xmath4 proximity effect in bi-2212/1t - tas@xmath5 junctions .",
    "these correlations confirm a strong interplay between high @xmath4 superconductivity and cdw order which is only beginning to be understood .",
    "high quality , optimally doped single crystals of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath9 ( bi-2212 ) were synthesized using the method of mitzi _ _ et al__@xcite , with the modification that a pt crucible was used in place of an alumina one .",
    "this avoided possible contamination of the melt via reaction with the crucible walls .",
    "single crystals of 1t - tas@xmath102 flakes were prepared using iodine vapor transport@xcite .",
    "the transport measurements shown in fig .",
    "s 1 verify the critical superconducting temperature of bi-2212 to be 85k , and the ccdw - nccdw transition temperatures for cooling and warming processes of 1t - tas@xmath1 to be 180k and 230k respectively .",
    "prior to junction fabrication , thick flake bi-2212 ( thickness around 10@xmath103 was mechanically exfoliated via nitto - revalpha thermal release tape .",
    "then , thick flake bi-2212 was transferred to a clean glass substrate by thin double sided tape .",
    "thin flake bi-2212 ( 0.5 to 2@xmath103 ) was then cleaved via scotch tape .",
    "a cleaved thin flake of 1t - tas@xmath1 ( 2 to 5@xmath103 ) was immediately placed against the cleaved surface of bi-2212 after similar mechanical exfoliation .",
    "the two cleaved flakes strongly adhere to each other via van der waals forces , naturally forming high quality nis or ns heterostructures . junctions with different transparencies , characterized with theoretical modeling by the extended btk model described in manuscript , were randomly achieved .",
    "no significant dependence of the transparency upon area of junction or thickness of flake were recognized .",
    "all steps of fabrication were performed in a dry atmosphere , and all cleaved surfaces of thin flake bi-2212 and 1t - tas@xmath1 were clean and flat with mean roughness within 2@xmath22 as indicated by the afm images shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](c ) ) . also , to implement four - terminal _",
    "c_-axis differential conductance measurements , the thin flake bi-2212 and 1t - tas@xmath1 were fashioned into narrow rectangular shapes oriented perpendicular to each other with an overlap area around 0.2@xmath23 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](d ) .",
    "all measurements including the four - terminal ac differential conductance measurements and the dc current - voltage ( @xmath24 ) measurements were performed over a wide range of temperature ( 2.5k to 120k ) using a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "samples were mounted on a commercial ppms puck and all measurements were performed in a low - noise screen room . for ac measurements , we used 23.3hz as the ac output frequency .",
    "the dc source voltage was supplied by a keithley 2400 source meter and the ac source was supplied by a agilent 33120a ac generator with @xmath104 .",
    "the dc and ac source signals were added using a homemade dc+ac adder and then applied to the junction .",
    "the dc bias across the junctions was measured with hp 3456a multimeter , the ac voltage signal with a sr830 dsp lock - in amplifier , and the ac current signal with a second sr830 lock - in amplifier after converting the current to a voltage using a sr570 current preamplifier .      for non - ideal ns junctions which have different density of states on the n and s sides ,",
    "the conductance at one specific temperature can not be simply normalized because of temperature dependence of the normal conductance .",
    "thus , we normalized the ac differential conductance of non - ideal ns junctions , such as junction-3 , junction-4 and junction-5 discussed in manuscript , by using the conductance at 100k manually scaled into the range of the normal conductance at one specific temperature as the effective normal conductance . for instance , in junction-3 the normal conductance at 5k is around 0.2@xmath37 and the conductance of the normal state at 100k is around 0.4@xmath37 .",
    "hence , the ratio factor @xmath105 is the ratio of the normal conductance at 5k to conductance at 100k , which is around 0.5 .",
    "then , the normalized differential conductance spectroscopy at 5k can be determined by multiplying a ratio factor @xmath105 when calculating the division of @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",

    "<S> understanding the coexistence , competition and/or cooperation between charge density waves ( cdws ) and superconductivity in the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) is an elusive goal which , when realized , promises to reveal fundamental information on this important class of materials . here , we use four - terminal current - voltage measurements to study the van der waals interface between freshly exfoliated flakes of the high-@xmath0 superconductor , bi-2212 , and the cdw - dominated tmd layered material , 1t - tas@xmath1 . for highly transparent barriers </S>",
    "<S> , there is a pronounced andreev reflection feature providing evidence for proximity - induced high-@xmath0 superconductivity in 1t - tas@xmath1 with a surprisingly large energy gap ( @xmath2mev ) equal to half that of intrinsic bi-2212 ( @xmath3mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> our systematic study using conductance spectroscopy of junctions with different transparencies also reveals the presence of two separate boson modes , each associated with a  dip - hump \" structure . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that the proximity - induced high-@xmath4 superconductivity in the 1t - tas@xmath5 is driven by coupling to the metastable metallic phase coexisting within the mott commensurate cdw phase . </S>"
