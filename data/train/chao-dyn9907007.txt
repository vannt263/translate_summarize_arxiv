    "the impressive progress in high - bit - rate optical fiber communications achieved during the last few years was primarily due to the invention of the dispersion management ( dm ) technique @xcite , which has become the key technological component of fiber telecommunications .",
    "a recent example of just how successful this technique is the 1.02  tbit / s data transmission achieved in standard optical fiber with dispersion management over 1000 km @xcite .",
    "the main factor that limits the bit - rate is pulse - broadening due to the chromatic dispersion of optical fiber .",
    "this broadening is characterized by the dispersion length , @xmath0 . here , @xmath1 is the fiber chromatic dispersion and @xmath2 is the bit - rate .",
    "the dispersion length @xmath3 is the distance at which the pulse - width approximately doubles due to dispersive broadening .",
    "this distance decreases as a quadratic function of the bit - rate .",
    "the basic idea of the dm technique is to compensate the fiber chromatic dispersion by periodically incorporating an additional element , such as a dispersion compensating fiber or fiber chirped gratings , whose sign of the chromatic dispersion coefficient is opposite to that of the main optical fiber .",
    "( see fig . ) .",
    "modern optical transmission systems must satisfy very strict requirements for bit - error - rate ( ber @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) .",
    "therefore , the pulse amplitude should be large enough so that it can be effectively detectable . as a consequence",
    ", the kerr nonlinearity of the fiber refractive index @xmath6 ( @xmath7  linear part of the refractive index , @xmath8  pulse intensity , and @xmath9  coefficient of kerr nonlinearity ) should be taken into account .",
    "the spectrum of an optical pulse with characteristic power @xmath10 will experience noticeable nonlinear distortion at distances grater than the characteristic nonlinear length @xmath11 .",
    "a natural idea is to control the nonlinear spectral distortion by properly choosing the value of the residual dispersion over the period of the fiber link .",
    "the dispersion management technique is currently the focus of intensive experimental , numerical and theoretical research @xcite because of its excellent practical performance .",
    "optical pulses in dm fiber links exhibit unexpected soliton - like properties , such as high stability and elastic interaction , despite the fact that the governing equation does not belong any known class of integrable equations .    in this paper ,",
    "we demonstrate that the leading - order equation describing the slow dynamics @xcite of optical pulses in such systems is close to integrable for the case of weak dispersion management .",
    "we also present the next order ( nonintegrable ) correction .",
    "this correction is small for weak dispersion management .",
    "the problem of weak dispersion management was considered in @xcite for the first time as a theoretical example of periodic variation of the dispersion coefficient in the model of transmission link .",
    "the power of lie transform technique proposed by authors earlier in @xcite was also shown in @xcite .",
    "this paper was published long before dispersion compensation became popular and before its strength was proven experimentally .",
    "the main result of this paper was that pulse propagation in fiber links with weak variation of dispersion can be described in leading order by an unperturbed nonlinear schroedinger equation . using a formalism which is common in weak turbulence theory@xcite",
    ", we derived similar results and investigated its validity by calculating the higher order corrections .",
    "the relevant equation for the electric field envelope @xmath12 is the nonlinear schroedinger equation ( nls ) with periodically varying dispersion and an external force representing fiber losses and amplification : @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 describes the fiber losses .",
    "the amplifiers that compensate the fiber losses are placed periodically at points @xmath15 and separated by distances @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficient of amplification @xmath17 is chosen to exactly compensate energy losses after passing the amplification distance @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 without loss of generality , we consider the case when the period of amplification is equal to the period of compensation . the theory can be trivially extended to the general case .    in practice , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , on the scale of the amplification distance @xmath18 , the pulse dynamics is practically linear . on the other hand",
    ", the linear evolution of the signal preserves the fourier spectrum of the pulse .",
    "one can consider optical pulse propagation over one period of a fiber link to be a mapping of the input pulse into the output pulse . to preserve the bit pattern ,",
    "this mapping must be both stationary and stable .",
    "stationarity can be achieved by a proper choice of the amplification coefficient of the amplification and by complete compensation of dispersion . in this case",
    ", stationarity will be achieved for any pulse shape .",
    "stability , on the other hand , is more complicated , and can be investigated through the slow nonlinear pulse dynamics .    in order to consider slow nonlinear pulse dynamics",
    "it is therefore natural to transform the equations into the fourier representation , and study the slow dependence of the spectrum on the coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "one can see the separation of scales in the equation ( [ nls ] ) : @xmath24 is dominated by the rhs and dispersion term .",
    "let us remove the external force ( rhs ) from ( [ nls ] ) by the transformation @xmath25 , and we obtain the equation latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } i q_z + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac { z_{\\rm nl}}{z_{\\rm dis } } d(z ) q_{tt } + c(z )     let us decompose @xmath19 into the sum @xmath27 where @xmath28 following @xcite , we represent @xmath29 as @xmath30 and compute the equation for the slow dynamics of the pulse s fourier spectrum in hamiltonian form @xmath31 with the hamiltonian @xmath32 where @xmath33 note that the kernel @xmath34 depends only on the composed variable @xmath35 , which , as we will see later , leads to important consequences .",
    "the leading - order approximation for the slow nonlinear dynamics can be obtained by averaging ( [ hamilton ] ) over @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting equation is valid if the pulse spectrum does not change appreciably over the amplification distance .",
    "the next order correction to the averaged equation was calculated in @xcite by using a lie transform @xcite .",
    "an alternative method for calculating these corrections was proposed in @xcite .    in the simple case of communication through one frequency channel , with the additional assumption that pulses do not interact with each other",
    ", one can use the quasi self - similar character of the single - pulse behavior @xcite , which was proposed for the first time by talanov ( lens transformation)@xcite . as a result",
    ", the slow dynamics of a single pulse is described by the nonlinear schroedinger equation with a quadratic potential .",
    "this approach was extensively discussed in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , and allows one to explicitly take into account the evolution of the single pulse spectra within the system period .",
    "another advantage of the quasi self - similarity is that it also holds for very small values of the residual dispersion .",
    "it was shown in @xcite,@xcite that stable single pulse propagation is possible for zero or even negative residual dispersion for special configurations of the dispersion map .",
    "however talanov s method can not be applied to the case of several interacting pulses within one frequency channel , nor can it describe the evolution of an optical pulse propagating in a system that utilizes the wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) technique .",
    "the wdm technique exploits several frequency channels for data transmission .",
    "optical pulse streams in systems that use this technique propagate in every channel with their own velocities and interact through the common refractive index .    in the fiber links with dispersion management , the nonlinear effects are smaller than the dispersive effects ,",
    "therefore the fourier spectrum of a pulse does not change much between amplifiers .",
    "hence , equation ( [ canonicalequation ] ) can be replaced by the equation averaged between the amplifiers . in the corresponding averaged hamiltonian ,",
    "@xmath34 is replaced by @xmath37 , so that this hamiltonian becomes @xmath38 this averaging is equivalent to assuming that higher order corrections in the lie expansion are small compared to the leading order .",
    "in our further analysis we will utilize ideas that are well developed in the theory of weak turbulence @xcite .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltontran ] ) as @xmath39 where we define the leading order quadratic dispersion relation as @xmath40 then @xmath41 satisfies the canonical equation of motion : @xmath42 if @xmath43 is a constant independent of the @xmath44 s , then equations ( [ hamiltonian]-[canonicalequation2 ] ) correspond to the usual nls equation . with @xmath45 given by ( [ hamiltontran ] ) @xcite ,",
    "these equations describe the averaged , slow - time evolution of an optical pulse propagating in a fiber - optical link with periodic amplifiers , damping , and dispersion compensators .",
    "to find the leading - order approximation to ( [ hamiltonian]-[canonicalequation2 ] ) , we follow @xcite and perform the transformation    @xmath46    the transformation ( [ transformation ] ) is canonical up to and including the cubic terms if the coefficients @xmath47 satisfy the symmetry condition @xcite @xmath48 substitution of ( [ transformation ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) transforms ( [ hamiltonian ] ) into @xmath49    the main mechanism of wave interaction is four - wave scattering , which occurs when @xmath44 s and @xmath50 s satisfy the following resonant conditions @xmath51 the set of @xmath44 s that satisfies these conditions is called the resonant manifold .",
    "the form of the transformed hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniantransformed ] ) explains the importance of the notion of a resonant manifold . indeed , at the points where ( [ resonancemanifold ] ) holds , in general",
    ", one can not choose the arbitrary coefficients @xmath52 to exclude the terms @xmath53 from the hamiltonian because of `` small resonant denominators '' .",
    "for the case of quadratic dispersion ( [ dispersion ] ) , equations ( [ resonancemanifold ] ) have only trivial solutions @xmath54    in this case the value of @xmath55 on the resonant manifold ( [ resonancemanifold]),([triv4 ] ) is equal to a constant independent of @xmath44 s : @xmath56",
    ". we will show below that the leading nonlinear approximation the equation ( [ canonicalequation2 ] ) with hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and quadratic dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) is the nls , and hence it is integrable .",
    "thus , we can integrate ( [ canonicalequation2 ] ) at the leading nonlinear order .    for the case of interest ,",
    "the interaction matrix element is a function of @xmath57 : @xmath58 now we choose the canonical transformation kernel as @xmath59 or equivalently , @xmath60 note that this expression does not have a `` small denominator '' problem .",
    "it is not singular on trivial resonances , i.e. it is not singular for @xmath61 .",
    "this fact is obvious from an expansion of @xmath62 in powers of @xmath63 : @xmath64 here @xmath65 , i.e. a constant independent of @xmath66 .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian acquires the form @xmath67 which is the hamiltonian of the nls equation to leading order .",
    "thus equation ( [ canonicalequation2 ] ) with hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) and quadratic dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) is integrable at the leading nonlinear order .",
    "the condition of quasi - identity of transformation ( [ transformation ] ) reads as @xmath68 let us estimate the @xmath69 in ( [ transformationkernel ] ) . for the case of a lossless piece - wise constant dispersion map with alternating pieces of fibers of length @xmath70 with dispersion @xmath71 and of length @xmath72 with dispersion @xmath73 , ( @xmath74 )",
    ", @xmath62 acquires the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the strength of a dispersion map . thus condition ( [ condition ] ) becomes @xmath77 so that the transformation ( [ transformation ] ) is quasi - identical for the so called weak dispersion maps , i.e. for the cases of small variation of the dispersion on top of big dispersion .    in this paper",
    ", we only study the sixth - order interaction in the averaged equations .",
    "zakharov @xcite recently pointed out that a canonical transformation similar to ( [ transformation ] ) can also be used to bring the original nonaveraged problem ( [ orig ] ) into a form analogous to that developed here for the averaged equation , namely , the nonlinear schroedinger equation with higher - order corrections .",
    "we believe that the present work is an important stepping stone in the proper development of a more sophisticated transformation , which will give us sufficient understanding to attack this much harder problem .",
    "in this section , we calculate the sixth - order interaction matrix element for the hamiltonian ( [ transformedtonls ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ transformedtonls ] ) is the averaged hamiltonian , and , including sixth - order terms , has the form : @xmath78    there are two ways of calculating the sixth - order interaction matrix element @xmath79 for the hamiltonian ( [ birghoffhigh ] ) .",
    "the first way is to calculate the higher order terms in the canonical transformation ( [ transformation ] ) .",
    "the second way , which is simpler and clearer , is to compute @xmath80 involving standard wyld diagram formalism @xcite which is a generalization of the feynman diagram technique for classical nonequilibrium systems .",
    "following @xcite the matrix element @xmath81 can be represented as sum of all topologically different irreduceable diagrams with no internal loops .",
    "below we present , an example of such a diagram . the structure of this diagram can be understood as follows : this diagram consists of two vortices a and b. each of these vortices forms a diagram which corresponds to four wave mixing . for computing of six",
    "order interaction term in the perturbation theory one should take two four - wave vortesces , connect them using all topologically possible configurations and then summ all of them .",
    "the number of such nonequvalent configurations is nine .",
    "the diagram presented below is one one of these nine terms .",
    "the analytical expression corresponding to this diagram is @xmath82    after summing up all 9 diagrams , the sixth order matrix element @xmath83 can be represented as @xmath84 where the nine variables @xmath85 are given by the following expressions + @xmath86    the resulting expression can be viewed as the measure of the `` distance '' of the perturbed system from its integrable analog .",
    "indeed direct calculations show that for the case of nls , when @xmath87 , this sixth order matrix element is identically equal to zero on the resonant manifold @xmath88 in order to bring equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as close to the integrable limit as possible , we must minimize @xmath81 over all the tunable system parameters .    for the case of a lossless piece - wise constant dispersion map , when the fourth order matrix element is given by ( [ sinus ] ) , we find ( using mathematica 3.0 ) , that the six wave interaction matrix element @xmath89 on the 6-wave resonant manifold ( [ res6 ] ) .",
    "therefore the above perturbation technique is valid for the case of a weak dispersion map . in leading order",
    ", the slow pulse evolution in optical fiber is governed by the integrable nls equation .",
    "we showed that the leading - order equation describing pulse dynamics in optical fiber links with a weak dispersion map is close to integrable . using canonical transformations",
    ", we found a nonintegrable higher order correction to the integrable part of the model equation describing the slow evolution of optical pulses .",
