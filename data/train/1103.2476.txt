    "relativistic fluid dynamics has been applied with success to describe the dynamics of hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic , and recently , at lhc @xcite . despite this success ,",
    "the derivation of relativistic fluid dynamics from an underlying microscopic theory is still an open problem and is under intense theoretical investigation .",
    "this is mainly due to nontrivial consequences imposed by causality and stability in relativistic fluids @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a general method to compute all linear transport coefficients ( such as the shear viscosity and its corresponding relaxation time ) associated with the dissipative behavior of fluids .",
    "in particular , we prove that this prescription gives a value for the shear relaxation time that , under the 14-moment approximation , coincides with the one derived from kinetic theory .",
    "this shows that transient dynamics is determined by the slowest microscopic and not by the fastest fluid - dynamical time scale .",
    "our approach @xcite depends only on generic analytical properties of retarded green s functions .",
    "let us consider the following linear relation between a dissipative current @xmath0 and its thermodynamical force @xmath1 in fourier space , @xmath2where we define the fourier transformation in the following way , @xmath3here , we adopt the following notation for the four - momentum and space - time coordinate , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . in this article , we discuss particle diffusion , in which @xmath6 is the diffusion current of a density @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and shear flow , in which @xmath6 is the shear stress tensor @xmath9 and @xmath10 the shear tensor @xmath11 , with the fluid four - velocity @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "equation ( [ maineq ] ) contains all the information about the linearized underlying microscopic theory in the form of the retarded green s function @xmath16 .",
    "when the system exhibits a clear separation between the typical microscopic and macroscopic scales , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , it is generally assumed that the dynamics of the system can be described in terms of a finite number of macroscopic variables .",
    "the macroscopic scale is associated with the variations of the thermodynamic force @xmath19 and its derivatives @xmath20 .",
    "the microscopic scale @xmath21 is contained in the poles and derivatives of @xmath22 and would be , for example , the mean - free path in dilute gases .",
    "the challenge is to determine the equation of motion satisfied by the current @xmath6 in terms of the microscopic information contained in the retarded green s function @xmath22 when such a separation of scales exists .",
    "the separation between microscopic and macroscopic scales is normally used to determine the macroscopic dynamics of the dissipative current @xmath6 in terms of an expansion in powers of knudsen number , @xmath23 .",
    "the simplest realization of this idea is known as the gradient expansion chapman . in the gradient expansion",
    "the dissipative currents are expressed solely in terms of gradients of fluid - dynamical variables . in practice ,",
    "the gradient expansion is implemented by expanding the retarded green s function , @xmath22 , in a taylor series around the origin , @xmath24 , @xmath25where the terms resulting from the expansion in @xmath26 are not explicitly denoted .",
    "this expansion leads to the following equation of motion for @xmath6@xmath27where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we remark that the gradient expansion usually does not involve time derivatives of the thermodynamic force .",
    "this is not a problem since one can in principle use the conservation laws to replace time derivatives by spatial gradients .    apart from overall factors which ensure the correct dimensionality , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively",
    "thus , the term @xmath33 is of first order in @xmath34 while @xmath35 is of second order in the knudsen number , @xmath36 . if @xmath37 , higher - order gradients can in principle be omitted and one obtains a closed macroscopic theory for @xmath6 .",
    "navier - stokes theory @xcite corresponds to truncating the series at first order while keeping higher - order corrections leads to the burnett equations burnett .",
    "this method , however , leads to unstable fluid - dynamical theories . in the non - relativistic case , the second - order truncation , i.e. , the burnett equation , is unstable @xcite . in the relativistic case ,",
    "navier - stokes theory itself is unstable @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that this instability in relativistic theories is intimately related to the violation of causality @xcite .",
    "such problems prohibit the application of these theories to describe any realistic system .",
    "in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ gradient1 ] ) , two main assumptions were employed : the separation between the microscopic and macroscopic scales and the gradient expansion itself .",
    "the first assumption is essential for the coarse - graining procedure that defines fluid dynamics and can not be disregarded . on the other hand ,",
    "the second assumption is solely based on the idea that the taylor expansion is able to describe the retarded green s function in the whole macroscopic / mesoscopic frequency domain .",
    "this need not be true , since it is known that green s functions are not necessarily analytic in the whole complex plane .",
    "in fact , these functions can have singularities in the complex @xmath39 plane , which necessarily restricts the domain of validity of the taylor expansion .    in order to illustrate the physical meaning of such singularities",
    ", it is convenient to consider the generalized diffusion equation for @xmath6 , also known as the maxwell - cattaneo equation @xcite . in this case , as in the israel - stewart theories of fluid dynamics @xcite , the dissipative current satisfies a relaxation equation . in the linear domain , this can be written as,@xmath40 in these theories there are two transport coefficients : the relaxation time @xmath41 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath42 . in fourier space , eq .",
    "( cattaneo ) can be written in the form @xmath43 , where@xmath44 it is important to notice the existence of a pole of @xmath45 on the imaginary axis . the existence of this pole is directly related to the existence of a non - zero relaxation time and , consequently , to the causal structure of the theory @xcite .",
    "it is also clear from eq .",
    "( cattaneo ) that fick s law and , consequently , the diffusion equation are recovered in the limit of vanishing relaxation time , @xmath46 .",
    "mathematically , this limit pushes the pole to infinity , rendering @xmath47 an analytic function in the whole complex @xmath39 plane . only in this case",
    "a taylor expansion near the origin has an infinite radius of convergence and is able to provide a good description of @xmath48 .",
    "however , in transient theories of fluid dynamics , where the relaxation time is necessarily nonzero , can a taylor expansion still be used ? strictly speaking , the range of the taylor expansion is limited by the existence of the pole .",
    "as was previously shown , the pole is directly related to the relaxation time and , consequently , the taylor expansion is unable to probe time scales of the order of the relaxation time .",
    "next , we consider a general analytical structure for @xmath50 . we assume that @xmath22 has @xmath51 poles in the complex @xmath39 plane , @xmath52 , ",
    ", @xmath53 , while the structure in the @xmath26 plane is analytic .",
    "note that , in principle , the number of singularities does not need to be finite .",
    "also , in many cases @xmath54 contains branch cuts , especially in the uv region , @xmath55 , which is sensitive to temperature - independent properties of the system .",
    "we only consider the region in the complex @xmath39 plane without branch cuts .",
    "then , @xmath22 can be expressed in the following way@xmath56 \\cdots \\left [ \\omega -\\omega_{n } ( \\mathbf{q } ) \\right ] } \\ ; ,   \\label{blabla}\\]]where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are analytic functions in the complex @xmath39 plane .",
    "we write the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ blabla ] ) in a polynomial form , @xmath59 \\cdots   \\left [ \\omega -\\omega_{n } ( \\mathbf{q } ) \\right ] } { \\omega_{1 } ( \\mathbf{q } ) \\cdots \\omega_{n}(\\mathbf{q } ) } \\ ; , \\label{poly}\\ ] ] where the @xmath60 are the zeros of the polynomial on the left - hand side and we introduced the functions @xmath61 @xmath62 combining eqs .",
    "( [ blabla ] ) and ( [ poly ] ) , we obtain @xmath63   \\tilde{g}_{r } ( q ) = \\frac{\\left ( -1\\right)^{n}\\xi ( q )   } { \\omega _ { 1 } ( \\mathbf{q } ) \\cdots \\omega_{n } ( \\mathbf{q } ) } \\;.   \\label{bla}\\ ] ] after taking the inverse fourier transform and expanding the functions @xmath61 in a taylor series around @xmath64 , we obtain a differential equation satisfied by @xmath65",
    ". it should be clear that this will be a linear differential equation of order @xmath51 in time .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath6 can be obtained by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ bla ] ) by @xmath66  and taking the inverse fourier transform .",
    "dnnr for details .",
    "the result is@xmath67here , we omitted all terms involving spatial derivatives .",
    "we introduced the transport coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70    if there is a clear separation of scales , i.e. , @xmath71 , it becomes possible to simplify the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sugoy ] ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath72 , and higher derivatives of @xmath10 can be neglected . however , in order to obtain a relaxation - type equation of motion for @xmath6 , additional approximations are required . for this purpose , one must impose the limiting procedure , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "in such a limiting procedure , all the poles of the retarded green s function except the pole nearest to the origin ( in the following referred to as the first pole ) are pushed to infinity @xcite . assuming that this can be done , we obtain the following equation of motion for @xmath6@xmath75where one can show that @xmath76 note that the time reversal symmetry of the retarded green s function requires the first pole to lie on the imaginary axis , such that @xmath77 is real , as it should be .",
    "it is also important to remark that eq .",
    "( [ 38 ] ) describes the long- ( but not asymptotically long- ) time evolution of the system .",
    "this is the physical origin of the limiting procedure previously implemented and it is the only limit in which a relaxation equation can be obtained and , consequently , a relaxation time can be defined .",
    "if one wants to describe even shorter time scales , it becomes necessary to include more terms @xmath78 in the discussion .",
    "then , the equations of motion will become more complicated .",
    "naturally , the gradient expansion is recovered when all poles are pushed to infinity and , in this sense , the gradient expansion can be interpreted as an asymptotic solution of the more general equation of motion @xcite .",
    "note that this limiting procedure is only allowed when the first pole lies on the imaginary axis . on the other hand , if the first pole and , for reasons of symmetry , its counterpart on the other side of the imaginary axis , have nonzero real parts one can not disregard one of the poles while keeping the other .",
    "then , the long - time evolution of the dissipative current will be characterized by a second - order differential equation and will display oscillatory motion .",
    "therefore , in this case the fluid - dynamical motion can not be reduced to a simple relaxation equation , even in the small - frequency domain .",
    "the discussion presented above is general and can , in principle , be applied to any type of theory . in this section",
    ", we apply this formalism to kinetic theory . in particular",
    ", we calculate the shear viscosity and relaxation time coefficients for a weakly coupled classical gas of hard spheres via the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "we perform all our calculations in the local rest frame of the fluid element , where @xmath79 .",
    "since we restrict our discussion to shear viscosity , we consider the simplified scenario in which the fluid does not accelerate , @xmath80 , and does not expand , @xmath81 , and where temperature , @xmath82 , and chemical potential , @xmath83 , are constant . with all these simplifications , the linearized boltzmann equation can be written as dnnr@xmath84where @xmath85 , with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . here , we introduced the collision operator , @xmath89 , defined as@xmath90where @xmath91 is the transition rate , @xmath92 is the symmetry factor ( @xmath93 for identical particles ) and @xmath94 .    using eqs .",
    "( [ linearboltzmann ] ) and ( [ collisionoperatordefinition ] ) , it is possible to express the fourier transform of the shear stress tensor , @xmath95 , in terms of the fourier transform of the shear tensor , @xmath96 , in the form @xmath97 @xcite , where@xmath98 in order to compute this green s function , we define a function @xmath99 which satisfies@xmath100as shown in the previous section , in order to extract the shear viscosity and relaxation time coefficients , it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath101 .",
    "then , the dependence of @xmath102 on @xmath103 can be expressed via the following expansion,@xmath104substituting eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , we obtain the following expression for @xmath105 , @xmath106where we introduced the thermodynamic integral@xmath107    thus , the relation between @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be cast into a more convenient form @xmath110 , with @xmath111 being given by @xmath112    the whole frequency dependence of @xmath113 is contained in the functions @xmath114 . the problem",
    "is then reduced to determining the analytic properties of @xmath115 . the way to solve",
    "this problem is to substitute the expansion ( expansion ) into eq .",
    "( [ equation ] ) , multiply by @xmath116 , and integrate over @xmath117 .",
    "then one obtains@xmath118where we defined the matrices @xmath119the solution of this equation can be formally expressed as , @xmath120 ^{mn}i_{n+3,2}.\\]]thus , we obtain @xmath121 ^{mn}i_{n+3,2}.\\ ] ] the poles of this function can be obtained from the roots of the determinant @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the relaxation times and viscosity coefficients are determined by inverting and finding eigenvalues of infinite - dimensional matrices . in practice",
    ", however , the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) has to be truncated and one never actually deals with infinite matrices .",
    "this is a common approach and happens quite often when dealing with the collision operator .",
    "let us try the simplest case and consider only one term in the expansion ( this corresponds to using the israel - stewart 14-moment approximation in the moments method ) . then all matrices become numbers and everything simplifies considerably . in this case , the retarded green s function has only one pole , @xmath123 @xcite .    since in this case the thermodynamic force",
    "is given by @xmath124 , the shear viscosity coefficient is given by @xmath125 .",
    "thus , the shear viscosity and relaxation time are given by@xmath126this implies that @xmath127 . in the massless limit , for a gas of hard spheres , @xmath128 @xmath129 , with @xmath130 being the total cross - section .",
    "exactly the same results were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite within a completely different approach .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the relaxation time in israel - stewart theories , which determines the time scale related to transient dynamics , is indeed a microscopic scale . in other words , the relaxation time is determined by the inter - particle scattering rate and not by an arbitrary fluid - dynamical time scale .",
    "in this work we proved that the existence of singularities in the retarded green s functions considerably restricts the applicability of the gradient expansion as a method to extract macroscopic dynamics . as a matter of fact , the causal structure of relativistic fluid dynamics hinges on the presence of poles in the green s functions .",
    "we computed the first pole of the retarded green s function associated with shear stress in a weakly coupled classical gas of hard spheres .",
    "we proved that the inverse of this pole is directly related to the relaxation time that appears in israel - stewart theory .",
    "consequently , the relaxation time in israel - stewart theories corresponds to a microscopic time scale and such theories are indeed describing the real transient dynamics of the fluid .    in summary , the true relaxation time is always given by the first pole of the retarded green s function .",
    "in general , the location of this pole can not be found using a truncated taylor expansion around the origin or , in other words , via the gradient expansion .",
    "this result should be expected since the transient behavior of a given system can not be unambiguously extracted from its asymptotic solution given by the gradient expansion .    the authors thank t.  kodama , t.  koide , a.  ficnar , and g.  torrieri for insightful discussions .",
