    "for many years , high energy physics has been looking forward to the beginning of the lhc program .",
    "there are high expectations that experiment will answer a number of outstanding theoretical issues , such as the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and the resolution of the hierarchy problem .",
    "however , the success of the experimental program will depend upon the development of better theoretical tools .",
    "our ability to identify new physics at the tev scale will depend , in large part , on our ability to accurately describe and separate out the known physics of the standard model .",
    "it is well established that at the tevatron and other colliders that leading order calculations of  processes are insufficient for an accurate description of hadronic interactions .",
    "next - to - leading order ( ) corrections in  are often quite large .",
    "the corrections typically change both the predicted magnitude of the scattering process and the shapes of distributions .    at the tevatron , which has little reach into the multi - hundred gev range ,",
    "it has been found that computing  corrections is generally sufficient to reduce the theoretical uncertainty of a calculation to about 10% . at the lhc , however , with its reach extending above the tev scale , it has been found that electroweak corrections can become quite large .",
    "it is therefore becoming important to develop tools for performing higher - order corrections in the full @xmath0 standard model .    in the past , many of the most exotic computational methods focused on not just because  corrections are large even at relatively low energies , but also because working with massless quarks and gluons simplifies expressions sufficiently to allow complicated algorithms to be worked out .",
    "recent advances now provide a framework in which massive theories can access the sophisticated advances developed for  calculations .",
    "the workhorse in perturbative calculations has long been the feynman diagram approach , which approach systematically includes all perturbative effects .",
    "however , the rapid growth in the number of feynman diagrams with the number of external legs , even for tree - level amplitudes , limits the practical application of this technique .",
    "in addition , feynman diagram calculations are subject to large cancellations among individual diagrams , especially when working with gauge theories .",
    "one tool that has long been used in  calculations to obtain compact results and largely avoid unphysical singularities and gauge cancellations is the helicity method  @xcite .",
    "when combined with recursion relations , both off - shell  @xcite and , more recently , on - shell  @xcite the helicity method can be used to generate compact expressions for for very complicated scattering processes .",
    "another very powerful technique that has greatly simplified the calculation of loop amplitudes in  is the unitarity method  @xcite .",
    "an essential feature of the unitarity method is that it sews together tree - level amplitudes into loop amplitudes .",
    "thus , efficient techniques for computing tree - level amplitudes which give compact expressions , like the use of recursion relations and the helicity method , directly benefit the unitarity method of computing loop amplitudes .",
    "there have been a number of new developments that have significantly enhanced the power of recursive methods and the unitarity method .",
    "these include the use of maximally helicity - violating ( mhv ) vertices in recursion relations at tree - level  @xcite and in loops  @xcite .",
    "unitarity methods have been improved by the use of the holomorphic anomaly  @xcite to evaluate cuts and the use of complex momenta  @xcite within the context of generalized unitarity  @xcite , which allows for the use of multiple cuts in a single amplitude .",
    "these techniques can be combined into a `` unitarity bootstrap ''  @xcite , a systematic , recursive approach to making high - multiplicity  calculations practical .",
    "the bootstrap combines the use of four - dimensional unitarity to determine the logarithmic and polylogarithmic terms in the loop amplitude with on - shell recursion relations to determine the rational contributions .",
    "recently , forde  @xcite has described an efficient method for extracting the coefficients of the triangle and bubble functions in amplitudes where only massless particles circulate in the loops .",
    "combined with the result of ref.@xcite , this is sufficient to determine the cut - constructable part of one - loop qcd amplitudes . in this paper , i will extend forde s formalism and define methods to extract the coefficients of all loop - integral functions in massive as well as massless theories .",
    "this will then allow this method to be used in the full @xmath0 standard model and even in the supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section([sec::notation ] ) , i will discuss the notation used and the application of spinor helicity conventions to massive complex momenta . in section([sec::methods ] ) , i will present an overview of the formalism which allows the simple extraction of the loop integral functions . in section([sec::box ] ) , i will discuss the extraction of the box functions ; in section([sec::triangle ] ) the extraction of the triangle functions ; in section([sec::bubble ] ) , the bubble functions ; and in section([sec::tadpole ] ) , the tadpoles .",
    "finally , i will comment on my results and draw my conclusions .",
    "an important feature of the method described in this paper is that it involves on - shell amplitudes where some of the on - shell momenta are complex .",
    "therefore , i will describe the conventions used to handle complex momenta and , especially , the spinorial representations of complex momenta .",
    "i treat real momenta using the spinor - helicity formalism of mangano and parke  @xcite , which i will summarize briefly .",
