    "in this paper , we discuss timing results for two millisecond pulsars ( msps ) discovered by the palfa consortium with the arecibo telescope .",
    "the palfa survey of the galactic plane and follow - up observations of new discoveries are motivated by the wide applications of pulsar timing in exploring the composition , internal structure , and magnetospheric state of neutron stars .",
    "millisecond pulsars in particular tend to be extremely stable rotators , which can be used to address a variety of problems in fundamental physics and astrophysics .",
    "one such outstanding problem is detecting gravitational waves and studying the properties of gravitational wave radiation from various types of sources and various epochs in the universe s lifetime .",
    "timing observations of msps in binary systems can be used to estimate the pulsar and companion masses via measuring post - keplerian binary parameters .",
    "neutron star mass measurements allow us to constrain the equation of state ( eos ) of matter at densities larger than that of an atomic nucleus .    until recently , all precise measurements of neutron star masses fell within a narrow range around 1.4  _",
    "@xmath1 , the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "however , recent , precise measurements of the masses of some msps showed that they can have significantly higher masses .",
    "psr  j1903 + 0327 @xcite , the first msp found in the palfa survey , has a mass of @xmath6 ( 99.7 % confidence limit , @xcite ) which is significantly above the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "psr j1614@xmath72230 was found to have a mass of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these high masses rule out many eoss for matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus . in particular",
    ", the mass measurement for j1614@xmath72230 rules out or highly constrains most proposed hyperon or boson eoss ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we describe two msps discovered by the palfa survey , which uses the arecibo telescope and the seven - beam alfa receiver @xcite .",
    "in addition to presenting full timing solutions for the two pulsars , we explore what intrinsic or extrinsic effects account for the overall toa uncertainty in both cases .",
    "one of the two discoveries reported here is in a nearly edge - on binary system with a massive companion , allowing measurement of the shapiro delay and consequently estimation of the pulsar and companion masses .",
    "psr j1949 + 3106 and psr j1955 + 2527 were discovered in palfa survey data taken in 2006 and processed by the cornell search pipeline @xcite .",
    "the palfa survey is ongoing since 2004 and uses the seven - beam arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) to search for pulsars in low galactic latitudes ( @xmath9 ) in the portions of the galactic plane visible from arecibo , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "palfa has discovered 97 new pulsars , including 15 msps , as of july 2012 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there are currently 23 pulsars in the atnf catalog @xcite with @xmath12  ms and @xmath13@xmath14  that are not in globular clusters . of those ,",
    "eight have dispersion measures ( dms ) @xmath15  pc  @xmath16 , and only one has @xmath17  pc  @xmath16 . that pulsar is j1903 + 0327 @xcite , an eccentric binary msp discovered by the palfa survey .",
    "the two discoveries we report , j1949 + 3106 and j1955 + 2527 , have @xmath18  pc  @xmath16 and 209  pc  @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "this makes the latter only the second galactic plane msp known with @xmath17  pc  @xmath16 . @xcite",
    "present four new msps with @xmath19  pc  @xmath16 , also found by palfa .",
    "one of these four pulsars has @xmath20  pc  @xmath16 .",
    "along with the high dms of j1903 + 0327 and j1955 + 2527 , this shows that the palfa survey is probing deeper and finding msps whose detectability with earlier instruments may have been hampered by dispersion smearing .    in 2006 , the palfa survey used the wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) backends @xcite with 100  mhz bandwidth per beam , two summed polarization channels , 256 lags , and 64  @xmath21s sampling time @xcite .",
    "since 2009 the survey uses the newer pdev / mock spectrometer , which allows data to be taken across the entire 300  mhz bandwidth of the alfa receiver for each beam , thus increasing sensitivity by a nominal factor of @xmath22 .",
    "this observation setup uses two summed polarizations , 960 channels , and a samping time of 65.5  @xmath21s .",
    "psr j1949 + 3106 and psr j1955 + 2527 were found in a conventional fourier - based periodicity search of wapp data and were not detected in a single pulse search .",
    "timing observations of the pulsars began initially with the green bank telescope .",
    "after a dedicated timing program was established , higher - sensitivity regular timing observations were done with the arecibo , nanay , and jodrell bank telescopes .",
    "green bank timing observations used the s - band receiver and the pulsar spigot backend @xcite with a total bandwidth of 800  mhz centered on 1890  mhz , 1024 lags , and 81.92  @xmath21s sampling time .",
    "because of strong and persistent rfi , the lowest 200  mhz of the band is excluded , leaving 600  mhz of effective bandwidth centered on 1950  mhz .",
    "the arecibo observations used the l - band wide receiver and wapp correlator backends .",
    "the four wapps covered adjacent 50  mhz bands with 512 lags each , centered at 1420 , 1470 , 1520 , and 1570  mhz .",
    "the sampling time for arecibo observations was 64  @xmath21s .",
    "gbt and arecibo observations were made in search mode , with two summed polarizations and continuous data streams recorded for off - line processing .",
    "after data collection , the outputs of the spectral channels were folded at the predicted topocentric period of the pulsar , shifted to compensate for dispersive delays , and summed to produce a total intensity pulse profile .    observations with",
    "the lovell telescope covered a 300-mhz band centered on 1500 mhz .",
    "a digital filterbank with a channel width of 0.5  mhz was used in a synchronous integration mode , in which the data acquisition is synchronous with the pulsar period .",
    "baseband data were collected for the duration of a time bin ( 1/1024 of a pulse period ) .",
    "the power spectrum of these data is then calculated and added to the cumulative spectrum for that bin . after shifting to compensate for dispersive delays ,",
    "the data were summed to produce a total intensity profile .",
    "this setup results in a sampling time of 12.83  @xmath21s for j1949 + 3106 and 4.76  @xmath21s for j1955 + 2527 .",
    "nanay observations were performed with the berkeley - orlans - nanay instrument @xcite and used coherent dedispersion performed by graphics processing units ( gpus ) in 4 mhz channels over a total bandwidth of 128  mhz centered at 1400  ghz . for each pulsar , all the observations at each frequency were integrated to produce a template used to derive topocentric times of arrival ( toas ) following a standard @xmath23 fit in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "we used the tempo2 software package @xcite to perform least - squares fitting of various pulsar parameters by minimizing the square of the differences between expected and measured toas .",
    "we directed tempo2 to fit for constant offsets between toa sets from different observatories by bracketing each toa set with jump statements .",
    "we scaled the toa uncertainties ( via efac statements , table  [ tab_toaerror ] ) so that for each toa set the ratio of @xmath23 to the number of degrees of freedom is close to unity .",
    "tempo2 applies clock corrections based on the location of each observatory and earth rotation data to convert toas to terrestrial time ( tt ) .",
    "conversion from tt to coordinated barycentric time ( tcb ) was done using the de405 solar system ephemeris @xcite . for j1949 + 3106",
    ", we used the damour & deruelle ( henceforth dd ) orbital model @xcite , with the shapiro delay parameterized as in freire & wex ( 2010 ) .",
    "the resulting best - fit parameters and other derived pulsar parameters are listed in table [ tab_pulsars ] .",
    "there are no significant trends in the timing residuals ; this implies that at the current timing precision , the ephemerides presented in table [ tab_pulsars ] describe the toas .",
    "both pulsars have now been timed for four years .",
    "this has allowed very precise measurements of the spin and astrometric parameters , in particular precise determinations of the proper motions of these two new objects , to be discussed below .      in order to measure the polarization characteristics of psr  j1949 + 3106",
    ", we observed it in coherent dedispersion mode at two different frequencies .",
    "our 25 minute gbt observation used guppi to sample a bandwidth of 200  mhz centered on 820  mhz .",
    "we also observed the pulsar for 15 minutes at arecibo using the asp backend @xcite with a bandwidth of 24  mhz centered on 1412  mhz .",
    "the data were analyzed in standard fashion with psrchive ( hotan et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the resulting calibrated full - stokes pulse profiles are shown in figure  [ fig_1949polgbt ] and figure  [ fig_1949polao ] .    at 820  mhz , there is little to no circular polarization in the second component of the pulse profile , or linear polarization in both components .",
    "this is somewhat unusual since pulsars are among the most polarized radio sources and individual pulsars can be up to 100% polarized ( e.g. @xcite ) . at 1412  mhz",
    ", there is some linear polarization in the first component , and the second seems unpolarized .",
    "the rotation measure is unconstrained in either observation . comparing the two profiles ,",
    "it is clear that the second component has a steeper spectrum than the first .",
    "this is confirmed by the observed profile evolution with frequency across the four wapp bands used in arecibo timing observations ( figure  [ fig_profs ] ) . assuming a 20% uncertainty , the measured period - averaged flux density is @xmath24mjy for the 820  mhz gbt observation and @xmath25  mjy for the 1412  mhz arecibo obsservation , giving a spectral index of @xmath26 .",
    "we observed psr  j1955 + 2527 for 10 minutes using the same arecibo asp setup and data reduction method described above .",
    "the calibrated full - stokes pulse profiles are shown in figure  [ fig_1955polao ] .",
    "there is little to no linear polarization and no circular polarization in the pulse profile , and the rotation measure is not constrained .",
    "the period - averaged flux density at 1412  mhz is @xmath27  mjy .",
    "psr  j1955 + 2527 is an isolated msp with a period of 4.87  ms and dispersion measure of 209.97  pc  @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig_profs ] shows a folded pulse profile from an arecibo timing observation .",
    "table  [ tab_pulsars ] summarizes the timing solution parameters , and figure  [ fig_1955resid ] shows timing residuals vs. epoch for the toas after removing the best - fit timing solution .    with its overall post - fit rms timing residual of 11.4  @xmath21s , j1955 + 2527 does not have high enough timing precision to be included in the pulsar sample used by pulsar timing array projects to attempt detection of gravitational waves .",
    "an rms residual on the order of 100  ns or lower is required for that purpose . in section  [ sec_errorbudget ]",
    "we investigate the contributions of various intrinsic and extrinsic effects to the timing residuals of both j1955 + 2527 and j1949 + 3106 .",
    "psr  j1949 + 3106 is an msp with a period of 13.14  ms and dm of 164.13  pc  @xmath16 .",
    "it is in a 1.95-day binary system , and because the orbital plane of the binary is inclined by @xmath28 as viewed from earth , we are able to measure the shapiro delay in the system and derive estimates of the pulsar and companion masses , and the orbital inclination angle .",
    "table  [ tab_pulsars ] summarizes the timing solution parameters for j1949 + 3106 , and figure  [ fig_1949shapiro ] shows timing residuals vs.  orbital phase for the toas used to obtain the solution .",
    "figures  [ fig_1949polgbt ] , [ fig_1949polao ] , and [ fig_profs ] show folded pulse profiles for j1949 + 3106 at 820  mhz , 1412  mhz , and the four wapp subbands , respectively .",
    "the timing solution of any pulsar binary includes the orbital period @xmath29 , the projected semi - major axis of the orbit @xmath30 ( typically expressed in light seconds ) , and parameters depending on the orbital eccentricity @xmath31 , the time of passage through periastron @xmath32 , and the longitude of the ascending node @xmath33 . for psr  j1949 + 3106",
    "they are presented in table  [ tab_pulsars ] . from these",
    ", we can estimate the mass function of the system : f(m_p , m_c ) = = , where @xmath34 is the mass of the pulsar , @xmath35 is the companion mass , @xmath36 is the orbital inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky , @xmath37 is the speed of light , and @xmath38 is the gravitational constant . for psr  j1949 + 3106 , we obtain @xmath39_@xmath1 . assuming that the pulsar has a mass close to the chandrasekhar limit ( 1.4 _ @xmath1 ) and an orbital inclination @xmath40 , we obtain a minimum companion mass of 0.8 _ @xmath1 . to disentangle the masses of the two components from the sine of the orbital inclination angle",
    ", we must be able to measure at least two post - keplerian parameters (   [ sec : shapiro ] ) .",
    "one important goal of pulsar surveys in general is to discover pulsars whose properties can constrain the equation of state of neutron - star matter .",
    "current proposed equations of state differ in their allowed ranges for pulsar rotation periods and masses .",
    "therefore , two ways of constraining them are to find very fast - spinning ( @xmath41  ms ) or very massive neutron stars ( @xmath42  _ @xmath1 ) . while pulsar rotation periods are obtained immediately upon discovery from fourier - based search algorithms , measuring pulsar masses is only possible for binary systems in which one or more post - keplerian effects can be measured .",
    "when the companion is between the pulsar and the earth , pulses traveling from the pulsar to the earth pass through the gravitational well of the companion and a relativistic delay is introduced in their arrival time as seen by the observer  the shapiro delay ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most orbital models parametrize the shapiro delay in terms of the `` range '' @xmath43 and `` shape '' @xmath44 .",
    "once we have fits for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we can solve for @xmath34 based on the mass function of the system .",
    "@xcite rewrite the shapiro delay in terms of two new post - keplerian parameters : @xmath47 , the amplitude of the third orbital harmonic , and @xmath48 , the ratio of the amplitudes of subsequent harmonics .",
    "the correlation between the parameters of this `` orthometric '' model is much weaker than the correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , leading to a better description of the combinations of @xmath35 and @xmath49 allowed by the timing measurements .",
    "we use this variation on the dd binary orbital model for j1949 + 3106 ( table  [ tab_pulsars ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_1949pdfs ] shows the constraints on the pulsar mass , companion mass , and orbital inclination that result from the measurement of @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "it also shows alternative constraints derived using the normal @xmath45-@xmath46 parameterization .",
    "the figure also shows 68.3% contours of the 2-d probability density function ( pdf ) derived from a @xmath23 map of the @xmath47-@xmath50 orthometric space , as described in section 5 of freire & wex ( 2010 ) ; this map provides very similar results to a @xmath23 map of the @xmath51-@xmath35 space .",
    "it is very clear that the 68.3% contours are better described by the @xmath48-@xmath47 parameterization : there are points in the diagram ( signaled in red ) that are 1-@xmath5 consistent with @xmath45 and @xmath46 that provide bad ( i.e. , high @xmath23 ) fits to the timing data .",
    "the lateral panels of figure  [ fig_1949pdfs ] show the projection of the 2-d pdf into the @xmath35 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 axes . from these 1-d pdfs",
    ", we obtain @xmath53  _ @xmath1 , @xmath54  _ @xmath1  and @xmath3@xmath14 , where uncertainties correspond to @xmath4-@xmath5 confidence levels .",
    "intermediate - mass pulsar binaries ( imbp ) have c - o or o - ne - mg wd companions with @xmath55  _ @xmath1  @xcite ; for this reason we classify psr  j1949 + 3106 as a member of this class .",
    "@xcite summarize possible imbp evolution scenarios and argue that the imbp j1802@xmath72124 has undergone common envelope ( ce ) evolution , leading to little mass accretion and a history similar to recycled pulsars with neutron star companions .",
    "imbps with longer orbital periods tend to have larger eccentricities as well @xcite .",
    "j1949 + 3106 is in the orbital period regime where one can argue that ce evolution is likely ( @xmath56  days ) .",
    "the observed eccentricities of imbps ( @xmath57 ) are higher on average than those of low - mass pulsar binaries ( lmbp ) , and the orbital eccentricity of psr  j1949 + 3106 ( @xmath58 ) is well within this interval .",
    "furthermore , the shorter accretion episode in imbps should not lead to the extreme quenching of the magnetic field seen in lmbps .",
    "this also agrees with observation : imbps lie in a region of the @xmath59 space distinct from lmbps @xcite : three of the systems have companion masses typical of lmbps , @xmath60  _ @xmath1 . ] , with higher estimated magnetic fields ( @xmath61 )",
    "again , the @xmath62 , @xmath63 and derived @xmath64 for psr  j1949 + 3106 are consistent with those of previously determined imbps .",
    "measuring the mass of psr  j1949 + 3106 precisely is important to test our understanding of stellar evolution . for imbps ,",
    "the comparatively short accretion episode has another predictable consequence : the total accreted mass should be ( much ) smaller than the 0.1 - 0.5 _",
    "@xmath1  expected for lmbps @xcite .",
    "therefore , the masses of pulsars in imbps should be very similar to their birth masses .",
    "this has recently been confirmed by the mass measurement of the imbp psr  j1802@xmath72124 ( @xmath65 _ @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "this implies that for j1949 + 3106 we should also expect a mass close to the chandrasekhar limit , and the current measurement of @xmath66 is consistent with this expectation .    a precise measurement of three post - keplerian parameters ( @xmath48 , @xmath47 and @xmath67 ) will over - determine the mass equations for this system .",
    "this implies that this system will eventually provide a test of general relativity .      for pulsars with small period derivatives",
    ", the contribution of the shklovskii effect @xcite to @xmath63 can be significant .",
    "the shklovskii effect is due to the change in projected distance between the pulsar and the solar system barycenter .",
    "another effect contributing to the observed @xmath63 is due to the difference in acceleration with respect to the galactic center between the sun and the pulsar .",
    "there is also a small contribution to the observed @xmath63 due to the pulsar being accelerated perpendicularly towards the galactic plane ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the contributions of these three effects to the measured @xmath63 values for j1955 + 2527 and j1949 + 3106 are given in table  [ tab_pdot ] .",
    "the net value is subtracted from @xmath63 listed in table  [ tab_pulsars ] for both pulsars before calculating the estimates for the spin - down luminosity @xmath68 , surface magnetic field @xmath69 , and characteristic age @xmath70 in the same table .",
    "one common feature of j1949 + 3106 and j1955 + 2527 is that the position angles of both pulsars proper motions in galactic coordinates are very closely aligned with the galactic plane ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , table  [ tab_pulsars ] ) .",
    "a major reason for the proper motions being closely aligned with the galactic plane is galactic rotation . with the sun and the pulsar moving around the galactic center in different directions at @xmath73  km  s@xmath74 , the relative velocity due to",
    "this motion is larger than the peculiar motion of the sun and the motion of the msp relative to the standard of rest at its position in the galaxy .",
    "another reason is a selection effect : the palfa search region is in the galactic plane , therefore msps with a significant component of motion away from the plane are less likely to be found .",
    "given the current locations of the two pulsars ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively ) , it is unlikely that they will ever move far from the galactic plane . in this respect",
    "they are very similar to psr  b1855 + 09 ( @xmath77  pc , @xcite ) and psr  j1903 + 0327 ( @xmath78  pc , @xcite ) , which are also close to the galactic plane . for the latter system ,",
    "measurements of the radial velocity of the companion also suggest a relatively small velocity relative to the pulsar s lsr .",
    "many ongoing surveys are , for the first time , finding a significant number of msps near the galactic plane ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . measuring the proper motions of these objects",
    "will be important to ascertain how many msps are tightly confined to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "if there is a statistical excess of such systems then they could represent a separate , low - velocity msp population .",
    "in this section we evaluate the relative contributions to the toa precision that have so far been achieved for j1949 + 3106 and j1955 + 2527 .",
    "first we test whether the residuals are consistent with white noise and then we evaluate the relative contributions to the white noise from three different effects . given the sharp , unresolved main component in the pulse profile of j1949 + 3106 , it is possible that broadband coherent dedispersion ( e.g. with the new puppi backend , a guppi clone recently installed at arecibo ) might achieve significantly improved timing precision in the near future , providing a much more precise shapiro delay , much more precise masses and a test of general relativity , as discussed above .",
    "a simple way to test whether the post - fit timing residuals are consistent with white noise is to count zero crossings @xcite .",
    "this test is applicable to non - uniformly sampled data and is insensitive to discontinuities in the statistics of the white noise , for example jumps in variance due to using different instruments , as is the case with our residuals . for @xmath79 samples of white noise",
    ", we expect on average @xmath80 zero crossings with a standard deviation of @xmath81 .",
    "a comparison between the observed and expected number of zero crossings for the residuals of j1949 + 3106 and j1955 + 2527 is shown in table  [ tab_crossings ] , including overall and per - observatory results . for 1949 + 3106 ,",
    "the number of zero crossings is within 1@xmath5 of the expected white noise value if the data sets from each observatory are treated separately . for j1955 + 2527 ,",
    "the number of actual and expected zero crossings is within 1@xmath5 for gbt toas and within 2@xmath5 for all other observatories .",
    "another white noise test involves fitting for a second frequency or period derivative .",
    "we expect that to be consistent with zero for white - noise - like residuals , and this is the result we obtain for j1949 + 3106 . for j1955 + 2527",
    ", we detect a second frequency derivative of @xmath82  s@xmath83 , confirming the indication from the zero crossing tests that this pulsar s residuals may exhibit some red noise characteristics .",
    "times of arrival are obtained by folding small portions of an observation ( typically a few minutes ) with an ephemeris that describes the timing solution of a pulsar , and then convolving the resulting folded profile with a pulse shape template . the pulse shape template used for extracting toas at a given",
    "observing frequency is the average of the folded profiles of many observations of the same pulsar at the same frequency .",
    "this is the method we use for obtaining toas for j1949 + 3106 and j1955 + 2527 .",
    "since toa extraction is based on matched filtering , we can view the toa and its uncertainty as a measurement of the pulse shape , which is affected both by the quality of the template and the amount of noise in the data .",
    "if the pulse shape does not change between observations , it can be described as an invariant template added to noise .",
    "assuming that the noise is white , @xcite derive the minimum toa error , @xmath84 , from system parameters and an effective pulse width @xmath85 .    for a noiseless gaussian pulse , @xmath86 .",
    "using equation  a2 from @xcite and smoothed versions of the toa extraction templates for arecibo observations of both pulsars with 1024 bins in the folded profile , we obtain @xmath87s for j1949 + 3106 and @xmath88s for j1955 + 2527 . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath89s for j1955 + 2527 , with unresolved structure on the leading edge of the pulse deviating from a gaussian . j1949 +",
    "3106 has a two - component main pulse with the fwhm of the brighter ( and narrower ) component of the main pulse @xmath90s . in both cases , @xmath91 of the main pulse , because the toa precision depends on the width of the narrowest substructure in the pulse that the template can match . in the case of j1949 + 3106 , where the two components of the main pulse are well resolved , @xmath92 of the narrower component . for j1955 + 2527 , @xmath85 is about a third of @xmath93 . even though the pulse profile of this pulsar is gaussian - like , it is not completely featureless .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath85 is likely affected by the presence of an unresolved bump on the leading edge of the main pulse and/or a slight bump at the very top of the pulse .",
    "for arecibo l - band timing observations , @xmath94  k and @xmath95  k / jy , giving @xmath96  jy . the bandwidth per wapp was 50  mhz , and each toa was obtained by folding 500  s of data . the peak pulse flux @xmath97  mjy for j1949 + 3106 and @xmath98  mjy for j1955 + 2527 .",
    "using equation  a1 from @xcite , we obtain @xmath99s for j1949 + 3106 and @xmath100s for j1955 + 2527 .      the folded pulse profile used in toa extraction",
    "is obtained from averaging many pulses . for pulsars in general , each individual pulse is narrower than the average pulse profile , and the average pulse profile extends over the phase window where individual pulses are observed .",
    "individual pulse phases may vary by an amount on the order of a pulse width from one pulse to the next .",
    "the folded pulse profile from which a toa is extracted depends on both the shapes of individual pulses and the distribution of their phases .    the intensity modulation index @xmath101 ( the ratio of intensity rms and mean as a function of pulse phase ) is used to characterize the amplitude modulation and the phase jitter and is typically of order unity ( e. g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
