    "besides being ubiquitous in nature , disorder leads to several intriguing physical phenomena .",
    "arguably , _ spin glasses _ represent one of the most prototypical examples of interesting behavior induced by disorder . while at any finite temperature disorder can prevent the usual magnetic ordering , at low - enough temperatures these systems display a new type of `` order '' . in the past",

    "the last refers to the breaking of the permutation symmetry among the fictitious replicas of the model , which are introduced to perform disorder averages ( via the so - called _ replica trick _",
    "finally , although the applicability of the s - k model to describe realistic spin glasses is still highly debated  @xcite , there are recent proposals on how to realize it in cold - atomic gases  @xcite , or in laser systems  @xcite .    in",
