    "display a variety of interesting dynamics phenomena and have therefore been the focus of many experimental and theoretical studies @xcite . in particular , thin polymer films have recently attracted a lot of interest since understanding their properties such as viscosity @xcite , chain mobility @xcite and stability @xcite is essential for optimization .",
    "a long time ago , taylor @xcite and culick @xcite analyzed the growth of a circular hole in a thin liquid sheet @xcite . by balancing surface tension forces against inertia @xcite",
    ", they found that the rim of liquid at the edge of the films retracts at a constant velocity , a prediction first checked experimentally by mc entee and mysels @xcite .",
    "debrgeas and collaborators @xcite have recently studied the bursting of thin suspended films of very viscous liquids .",
    "these experiments revealed unexpected features : ( a ) first , the retraction velocity grows exponentially with time ( with a characteristic time scale @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the initial film thickness , the viscosity and the spreading coefficient @xcite ) , ( b ) second , the liquid is _ not _ collected into a rim and the film remains flat through the retraction . according to these authors , the uniform thickening of the retracting film was a consequence of its viscoelasticity , which permits an elastic propagation into the film of the surface tension forces acting on the edge .",
    "brenner and gueyffier @xcite showed , however , that the absence of rim can also result from a purely viscous effect @xcite .    very recently",
    "@xcite , reiter studied the dewetting of ultrathin ( _ i.e. _ thinner than the coil size ) , almost glassy polystyrene ( ps ) films deposited onto silicon wafers coated with a polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) monolayer . he found that a highly asymmetric rim , with an extremely steep side towards the interior of the hole and a much slower decay on the rear side , builds up progressively @xcite , with the maximum height increasing linearly with the diameter of the hole .",
    "we recently @xcite proposed a theoretical model to explain such deviations from the behavior of pure liquids , based on the shear - thinning properties of the polymer film .",
    "assuming that the stresses inside the film saturate logarithmically with the strain rates , we showed that different regimes of growth are expected , depending on the initial film thickness and the experimental time range .",

    "as mentioned in @xcite , this logarithmic law does not permit a simple analytical description of _ all _ the regimes of time and thicknesses .",

    "we have checked numerically ( cf . fig.[hm en t^1+m ] ) that the anticipated analytical behavior @xmath134 is obeyed after the crossover time @xmath135 .",

    "_ @xcite carried out experiments on viscous bursting of freely suspended films of long - chain polymers .",

    "( 5 to 250 @xmath139 m ) covers the domain @xmath140 . as the corresponding crossover time is very large ( @xmath141 ) , these experiments mainly covered the first regime @xmath142 ( the criterion @xmath129 is in fact a basic hypothesis of their `` soft balloon '' model @xcite ) . in our model , the velocity field @xmath7",
    "is found to be almost proportional to @xmath143 at any time for thick profiles ( cf .",
    "fig.[speed ] ) , similar to the experimentally observed long range radial plug flow @xcite .",
    "thus , our model accounts well for the exponential growth and the absence of rim characteristics of the dewetting regime observed by debrgeas _",
    "et al . _ for viscous polymer films .",
    "g. reiter @xcite studied the dewetting of ultra - thin , almost glassy polystyrene films deposited onto silicon wafers coated with a polydimethylsiloxane monolayer .",
    "the thicknesses of the ps films used range from @xmath14410 to @xmath14460 nm . compared with the characteristic scale @xmath145 nm , the ratio @xmath146 ranges from about 0.2 to unity .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath17 for ps under the experimental conditions is very long , up to more than a year for the lowest temperatures conditions ( @xmath147 ranges from @xmath148c to @xmath149c , to be compared with the bulk glass transition temperature : @xmath150c ) .",
    "we can thus expect that the relevant regime for comparing our results with reiter s experimental findings is the limit @xmath151 , and @xmath152 small ( cf .",
    "[ thin initial ] ) .",
    "three years ago , dalnoki - veress _",
    "made an experimental study of hole formation and growth in freely standing ps films @xcite . in agreement with debregeas experiments , they observed exponential growth of the hole radius and uniform thickening , but with a deviance from this regime for long - time regimes of growth , a feature they analyzed in terms of shear - thinning properties .",
    "they indeed characterized the polymer rheology at the temperature of their experiments ( @xmath153c ) and found that the best fit for the viscosity @xmath2 versus the shear strain rate @xmath154 is a power - law dependence :    @xmath155    with a power - law index @xmath156 .",
    "for the following , let us suppose that the rheology of ultra - thin ps films used by reiter can be described by the cross model ( eq.[cross model ] ) with such a power - law index : @xmath109 .",
    "it is of course an hypothesis that would need an experimental validation . in particular",
    ", the rheology of ps films at temperatures _ very close _ to the glass transition may be quite different . keeping this point in mind ,",
    "the following remarks are tentative explanations of some regimes of dewetting experimentally observed by reiter .    if @xmath109 , eq.[def of psi ] leads to the exact value @xmath157 .",
    "then eq.[rd vs hm ] turns out to be simply linear :    @xmath158    this property was indeed observed by reiter : the maximum height of the rim grows at the same speed as the radius of the hole @xcite . the special role played by this value @xmath109",
    "was also pointed out by shenoy and sharma in their study of the dewetting of power hardening viscoplastic solid @xcite .",
    "we can also focus on the individual dependences of @xmath100 and @xmath101 versus time .",
    "as precised in part [ thin initial ] , for @xmath159 , the rim height and the hole radius follow a power - law time dependence : @xmath105 and @xmath160 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath109 , we obtain : @xmath161    very recently , reiter @xcite characterized the time dependences of @xmath101 and @xmath100 for very thin films .",
    "he obtained several dewetting regimes , and work is in progress to analyze these results .",
    "it seems that several experimental factors must be taken into account for this analysis . among them",
    ", the influence of film preparation appears to be decisive : the spin - cast ps film is a highly metastable form of matter @xcite . the sample preparation ( including the time of healing ) can lead to thin films where residual constraints on the chains persist , and may have an influence on the dewetting process .    quite interestingly , despite all these remarks , for a 20 nm ps film deposited on a 10 nm pdms layer around @xmath162c , the results of reiter s experiments seem to indicate that the maximum height of rim and the hole radius obey power - laws :    @xmath163    the time range on which reiter calculated these power - law indexes is up to about 100 minutes .",
    "as for a 20 nm film , the ratio @xmath146 is smaller than unity , the crossover time @xmath107 is very short , and we can expect that the power - law regime ( eq.[power laws theor ] ) is established . thus we can compare eqs.[power laws theor ] and [ power laws exp ] and remark that the two experimental coefficients are indeed very close to the predicted one : 1/3 .",
    "this adequation between our model and reiter s experimental results appears to be satisfying .",
    "but many questions remain open , as the role played by the thin pdms monolayer on which the ps film dewets is only taken into account by the free slippage condition @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown by several studies that the lower layer is deformed by the moving upper one @xcite , which can leads to viscous dissipation and to a marked decrease in the dewetting velocity @xcite .",
    "let us conclude by a tentative idea : observing by tappingmode atomic force microscopy ( tm - afm ) the dry zone on the pdms substrate after the removal of ps film , reiter @xcite discovered the formation of straight lines , several microns long , starting to appear at hole diameters larger than about 1 @xmath139 m .",
    "these lines are ps microfibrils , whose width can be as low as about 2 nm ( to be compared with the radius of gyration of the polymer in the bulk , of order 50 nm ) .",
    "this observation suggests that the radial strain - rates are much larger than the orthoradial ones at the hole periphery and involve this elongational deformation of the molecules .",
    "this property could be related to the fact that , in our model , the radial strain - rate ( @xmath41 ) is large compared with the orthoradial one ( @xmath42 ) during the initial stages of growth for thin films ( cf .",
    "fig.[function f(beta ) ] , regime @xmath49 ) .",
    "in particular , note that this dissymmetry between values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a direct consequence of the shear - thinning behavior of the polymer : for a purely viscous fluid , @xmath164 for any thickness .",
    "in conclusion , our model accounts well for the exponential growth and the absence of rim characteristics of the dewetting regime observed by debrgeas _",
    "et al . _ for viscous polymer films .",
    "taking into account the shear - thinning behavior of the polymers near @xmath22 enables us to see the modifications induced by this particular rheology on the film morphology .",
    "it appears from our results that the early stages of dewetting for a shear - thinning polymer film are mainly determined by the ratio of its initial thickness @xmath60 to a characteristic scale @xmath63 ( related to the driving force of the process , @xmath3 , and the rheological response of the material , characterized by @xmath16 ) .",
    "the film profile exhibits a sharp , asymmetric rim similar to the one observed by reiter in his latest experiments with ultrathin ps films .",
    "the rich variety of growth behavior is summarized in appendix [ bilan ] . in all cases ,",
    "the long - time evolution of @xmath100 is a power - law ( whose coefficient depends on the rheology of the material studied ) , and @xmath101 obeys a stretched exponential law . when taking for the power - law index @xmath28 the value obtained by dalnoki - veress _",
    "et al . _ , in the thin - film limit , our predictions for the dry radius and the rim height time - evolutions seem to explain some of reiter s latest experiments . in particular ,",
    "the linear dependence of the rim height versus the dry radius experimentally observed is predicted by our model for the power - law index @xmath109 .",
    "work is now in progress to incorporate in our model the laplace pressure ( see @xcite ) which might lead to oscillatory dewetting fronts @xcite , and to evaluate the possible effects of chain entanglements . in the future , we aim to study the dewetting of thin polymer films _ below _",
    "@xmath22 , where the existence of a yield stress in the rheological response of the material may lead to new dewetting morphologies .",
    "we are grateful to g. reiter for very useful discussions and for providing us with his experimental results on the dewetting of ultra - thin polystyrene films prior to publication .",
    "we also wish to acknowledge fruitful discussions with a. aradian , g. debrgeas , and m. sferrazza .",
    "our choice of model ( see [ the model ] ) for the dewetting film deserves a few comments . as defined above , @xmath7 is the radial part of flow field .",

    "this property is due to the fact that the function @xmath190 is analytical ( in the mathematical sense ) , _ i.e. _ admits a series expansion near @xmath191 whose first non - linear term is @xmath192 .",
    "it indeed corresponds the limit behavior obtained by taking the cross law with @xmath78 .",
    "_ for thin films , at short times _ , a sharp rim grows very quickly ( with an initial speed @xmath193 ) . in this regime , @xmath5 is well described by the integral equation :    @xmath194    _ for thin films , at long times _ , as for the cross law , the hole growth connects with the long - time regime of thick films ( eqs.[hm gd tps log]-[rayon sec a t g tau log ] ) .",
    "figures [ hi ll ho ] and [ hi gg ho ] propose a summary of the different dewetting time regimes for a cross constitutive law , depending on the initial thickness ( to be compared with @xmath110 ) , and relative to different time ranges ( to be compared with crossover times @xmath107 , @xmath121 and @xmath195 ) .",
    "to know the profile @xmath4 , the equation [ edp profil ] has to be solved :    @xmath196    along with the precedently precised initial condition ( eq.[boundary ] ) and the boundary values @xmath197 and @xmath198 . as a a quasi - linear partial derivative equation , eq.[edp profil ]",
    "can be solved using a method of characteristics , as precised in this appendix .",
    "writing @xmath199 , we can replace the partial derivative with respect to @xmath90 thanks to eq.[edp profil ] .",
    "let define a characteristic by the function @xmath200 , indexed by the parameter @xmath201 with @xmath202 , and obeying the following ordinary differential equation :    @xmath203    eq.[def caract ] is tractable , and gives each characteristic as a function of time : @xmath204    in fig.[caracteristiques ] is shown a representation of characteristics @xmath200 versus time , for a thin film ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "note that these curves were extracted numerically from our model , and are not a graphic illustration of solutions of eq.[eqn caract ] .    along a given characteristic , the rim height @xmath206 obeys a simple equation : @xmath207    whose solution is explicit and of the form :    @xmath208    inverting eq.[eqn caract ] to express @xmath201 as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath90 enables us to extract the complete equation of the profile ( eq.[solution profil ] ) :    @xmath209      in the film zone near the hole ( @xmath210 ) , the strain - rates @xmath41 and @xmath42 are high .",

    "it is then found that @xmath218 as long as time @xmath90 is smaller than a critical value @xmath220 given by : @xmath221    for @xmath205 , @xmath109 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 , eq.[t * ] shows that the high strain - rates hypothesis remains valid on a wide region as long as @xmath224 .",
    "thus , the eq.[solution profil ] is a good description of the film profile during all the initial regime of growth .",
    "the results presented above are obtained taking a discontinuous shape for the initial profile of the film : @xmath225        this profile is infinitely derivable at @xmath226 , the parameter @xmath228 giving an order of the characteristic length of transition between the regions @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the profiles obtained with this initial condition are shown in figure [ smooth ] , with @xmath231 ( the shape of the initial profile , represented in dashed lines in fig.[smooth ] , is very smooth ) .",
    "the rim growth seems to be very fast for a thin film ( the time range of curves in fig.[smooth ] is 0 to @xmath232 ) .",
    "similarly , the increasingly asymmetric shape of the profile shows that , even when starting with a smooth profile , the resulting morphology of the rim is the same as in reiter s experiments .",
