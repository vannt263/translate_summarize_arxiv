    "in this short article we address supersmoothness : a phenomenon where under certain circumstances continuity of a function of two variables implies its differentiability at a point or , consequently , differentiability of a bivariate function implies its higher order differentiability at a point .",
    "supersmoothness was first observed for a particular class of piecewise bivariate polynomial functions , called splines , by farin in  @xcite .",
    "he considered a triangle @xmath0 partitioned into three subtriangles @xmath1 and @xmath2 as shown in figure  [ circles ] .            a spline @xmath3 on this triangulation of @xmath0 is a function of two variables such that for each @xmath4",
    ", the restriction @xmath5 a polynomial .",
    "farin proved that if the spline @xmath3 is differentiable of order  @xmath6 , then it has all @xmath7st order partial derivatives at the origin @xmath8 .",
    "that is for all @xmath9 : @xmath10 supersmoothness of splines was observed for trivariate splines in  @xcite , and studied in general in  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been attributed to the polynomial nature of splines .",
    "recently , while flying on delta , the authors were struck by the similarity of the emblem of the airline and figure  [ circles ] .",
    "this lead us to the subject of this paper .    in the next section",
    "we will demonstrate that basic supersmoothness is a rather general property of non - smooth curves , not just polynomials . loosely speaking :",
    "if we want to continuously glue two smooth bivariate functions along a curve with a  corner \" at a point @xmath11 , the resulting continuous function must be differentiable at @xmath11 , as if to compensate for the singularity of the curve .",
    "moreover , locally , supersmoothness characterizes non - smooth curves .    in section 3",
    "we address another peculiarity of supersmoothness .",
    "we first show that property  ( [ 1 ] ) holds for all smooth functions defined over a partition of  @xmath12 by @xmath13 non - collinear rays emanating from the origin , @xmath14 .",
    "the assumption that the rays are not collinear is significant .",
    "if just two of the rays are parallel the phenomenon of automatic supersmoothness disappears alltogether .",
    "this can be seen on the following simple example .",
    "consider the partition of  @xmath12 by the @xmath15-axis .",
    "for any @xmath14 , let @xmath16 be equal to @xmath17 on the upper half plane and zero on the lower one .",
    "we now can add any @xmath6 rays emanating from the origin but not along the @xmath15-axis .",
    "this will form a partition of  @xmath12 by @xmath13 rays as in figure  [ counter ] .",
    "then @xmath18 has all derivatives of order @xmath6 , yet @xmath19 .",
    "we note that all the proofs in this article are simple and should be accessible to undergraduate students familiar with the basics of multivariate calculus , such as in  @xcite .",
    "in this section we will show that a version of supersmoothness occurs when we glue two differentiable functions along a curve with sharp corners as in figure  [ 3 ] .",
    "namely , we will show that the resulting piecewise function is differentiable at every sharp corner of the curve . to some extent",
    "this property of supersmoothness characterizes curves with sharp corners .",
    "in contrast with most of the research on curves in both analysis and differential geometry , we are interested in non - smooth curves . while regularity of a curve is defined globally , non - smoothness has to be localized to a point @xmath20 .",
    "recall ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that a curve @xmath21\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^{2}~\\ ] ] is regular if @xmath22 is differentiable and @xmath23 for all @xmath24 . in particular , for every point @xmath24 at least one of the derivatives , say @xmath25 .",
    "hence the function @xmath26 is invertible in a neighborhood of that point .",
    "setting @xmath27 we have @xmath28 and we can reparametrize a portion of the curve as @xmath29 where @xmath30 .    to keep this article within reach of calculus students we limit our considerations to non - self - intersecting curves and adopt the following , intuitively clear version of  local smoothness \" .",
    "let @xmath31 be the trace of a continuous non - self - intersecting curve @xmath32\\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^{2}$ ] , also known as a jordan arc . without loss of generality assume that @xmath33 and @xmath34    we shall say that @xmath22 is smooth at @xmath11 if @xmath31 can be represented as a graph of a continuously differentiable function in some neighborhood of @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely ,    [ pointsmooth ] the trace of a jordan arc @xmath22 is smooth at a point @xmath11 if there exist open intervals @xmath35 , @xmath36 and a function @xmath37 such that @xmath38    [ newdirect ] the trace of a jordan arc @xmath31 is smooth at @xmath11 if and only if there exists a neighborhood @xmath39 of @xmath11 and a function @xmath40 continuously differentiable on @xmath39 such that @xmath41    if @xmath31 is smooth at @xmath11 we use the neighborhood @xmath42 and the @xmath43-continuous function @xmath18 from definition  [ pointsmooth ] to construct @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , @xmath40 satisfies all the desirable properties .",
    "conversely , without loss of generality , assume @xmath45 and let @xmath40 be a @xmath43-continuous function on some neighborhood  @xmath39 of  @xmath11 , such that @xmath40 vanishes on  @xmath31 , and @xmath46 .",
    "then by the implicit function theorem , there exist open intervals @xmath47 and @xmath48 and a @xmath43-continuous function @xmath18 such that @xmath49 we can assume that @xmath50 , which implies that @xmath51 we now need to show that there exist perhaps other intervals @xmath52 and @xmath53 such that @xmath31 coincides with the graph of @xmath18 in @xmath42 . to this end",
    ", we consider the inverse image @xmath54 , which is an open set in @xmath55 $ ] containing zero .",
    "thus , there exists @xmath56 such that @xmath57 maps @xmath58 into @xmath59 .",
    "we observe that if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 also vanishes since @xmath18 is a function passing through @xmath62 .",
    "then we have @xmath63 which contradicts the assumption that @xmath64 has no self - intersections .",
    "thus , neither @xmath65 nor @xmath66 vanish . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume @xmath67",
    ". then @xmath66 must be negative .",
    "otherwise either @xmath31 has a self - intersection or @xmath18 is not a function .",
    "since @xmath68 is continuous , its trace from @xmath69 to @xmath70 must coincide with the graph of @xmath18 from @xmath71 to @xmath67 .",
    "thus , for @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , the function @xmath18 satisfies definition  [ pointsmooth ] .    as a corollary we obtain the promised result on supersmoothness :    [ direct ] let @xmath74 be the trace of a jordan arc that divides the open disk @xmath75 into two subsets @xmath76 and @xmath77 as in figure  [ 3 ] .",
    "further assume that @xmath31 is not smooth at @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79 be @xmath80 functions on @xmath75 continuously glued along @xmath31 , that is , let @xmath81 be a continuous function on @xmath75",
    ". then the piecewise function @xmath3 is differentiable at @xmath11 , that is , @xmath82    consider a @xmath80 function @xmath83 .",
    "the fact that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are continuously glued along @xmath31 means that @xmath86 and by theorem  [ newdirect ] @xmath87 thus , @xmath88 , and the proof is complete .",
    "a partial converse of theorem  [ direct ] holds true in the following sense :    [ partial ] let @xmath89 be the trace of a jordan arc that divides the open disk @xmath75 into two subsets @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "assume that @xmath22 is smooth at a point @xmath90 .",
    "then there exists a neighborhood @xmath39 of @xmath11 and and two differentiable functions @xmath91 such that the function @xmath92 is not differentiable at @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be chosen as in theorem  [ newdirect ] , i.e. , satisfying conditions  ( [ nd ] ) .",
    "let @xmath93 and @xmath94 . then , since @xmath95 , the function @xmath3 defined by  ( [ 2.1 ] ) is continuous and not differentiable at @xmath11 because @xmath96 .",
    "theorem  [ partial ] provides only a partial converse of theorem  [ direct ] because the function @xmath3 is defined locally , in a neighborhood @xmath39 of @xmath11 , and not on all of  @xmath97 .",
    "we believe that the global version of this theorem also holds and end this section with a conjecture .",
    "[ conj ] let @xmath74 be a continuous curve that divides an open disk  @xmath75 centered at @xmath11 into two subsets @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath31 is smooth at @xmath11 if and only if we can glue two continuously differentiable functions along the curve as in  ( [ 2.1 ] ) so that the resulting piecewise function @xmath3 is not differentiable at  @xmath11 .",
    "consider two non - collinear rays @xmath98 and @xmath99 emanating from the origin in  @xmath12 .",
    "the curve formed by these two rays is not smooth and partitions the open unit disk @xmath75 into two sectors @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "it follows from the results of the previous section that two differentiable functions @xmath102 and @xmath103 continuously glued along the boundary of the sectors as in  ( [ 2.1 ] ) produce a piecewise function @xmath104 differentiable at the origin : @xmath105 farin s observation  ( [ 1 ] ) shows that for three pairwise non - collinear rays emanating from the origin and a piecewise function @xmath106 consisting of three differentiable pieces as in figure  [ circles ] the following holds : @xmath107 however , as it was pointed out in the introduction , for three non - collinear rays amplification  ( [ 3.1 ] ) may not hold , that is , in general @xmath108 in this section we extend this pattern . for a fixed @xmath14 , we partition the open disk @xmath75 into @xmath13 sectors @xmath109 by pairwise non - collinear vectors ( rays )",
    "@xmath110 positioned clockwise as in figure  [ 3.2 ] .",
    "then we create a piecewise function @xmath111 by gluing @xmath13 functions @xmath112 along the rays .",
    "thus for @xmath113 , the sector @xmath114 is formed by @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and the sector @xmath117 is formed by @xmath118 and @xmath98 . we will show that similarly to  ( [ 1 ] ) the following holds : @xmath119 yet the weaker assumption @xmath120 may not imply the associated conclusion that @xmath121 .",
    "we start with a simple lemma that shows that two differentiable functions continuously glued along a ray @xmath122 must be differentiable in the direction of @xmath122 .",
    "we use @xmath123 to denote the directional derivative in the direction of  @xmath122 .",
    "[ lemma ] let @xmath124 be a unit vector in @xmath125 .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath126 be continuously differentiable functions in an @xmath127-neighborhood of the origin in @xmath125 such that @xmath128 then @xmath129        [ main ] let functions @xmath135 be @xmath6 times continuously differentiable on @xmath75 and let @xmath3 be defined piecewise on each sector @xmath136 by @xmath137 , @xmath138 . if @xmath139 then @xmath3 has all derivatives of order @xmath140 at the origin ; that is , @xmath141 , @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath142 , the proof is given in theorem  [ direct ] .",
    "let @xmath9 .",
    "we will show that for two neighboring functions , say @xmath143 and @xmath144 , all partial derivatives of order @xmath140 coincide at the origin .",
    "then for every @xmath145 , @xmath146 which would prove the theorem . without loss of generality",
    "we consider the neighboring functions @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "it is clearly enough to prove that @xmath147 observe that for @xmath148 , the assumption @xmath139 implies that the functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 are continuously glued along the ray  @xmath99 .",
    "hence , by lemma  [ lemma ] we obtain @xmath151 which implies  ( [ deriv ] ) for @xmath148 .",
    "hence it remains to prove that @xmath152 since all the vectors @xmath115 are pairwise non - collinear we can find constants @xmath153 and @xmath154 such that @xmath155 for all @xmath156 .",
    "then @xmath157 for some constant @xmath31 and some homogeneous polynomial @xmath158 of order @xmath159 .",
    "since , by the assumption , @xmath160 and @xmath161 coincide along the ray @xmath99 , by lemma  [ lemma ] @xmath162 similarly , for every @xmath163 , the functions @xmath164 coincide along the ray @xmath165 .",
    "hence , by lemma  [ lemma ] , for every @xmath163 , @xmath166 thus , we obtain the following chain of equalities @xmath167 the last equality follows from lemma  [ lemma ] since @xmath102 and @xmath168 share a common edge @xmath98 .",
    "thus @xmath169 which completes the proof of  ( [ deriv ] ) , and consequently proves the theorem .      [ supmain ] let functions @xmath135 be @xmath170 times continuously differentiable on @xmath75 , with @xmath171 , and let @xmath111 be defined piecewise on each sector @xmath114 by @xmath172 , @xmath173 . if @xmath174 then @xmath111 has all derivatives of order @xmath175 at the origin , that is , @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "we finish this section and this article by constructing polynomials ( hence smooth functions ) @xmath178 , @xmath9 , such that the spline @xmath111 defined by @xmath179 is in @xmath180 yet @xmath181 .",
    "we note that if @xmath142 , it is immediately obvious that @xmath182 and @xmath183 do not join continuously at the origin .",
    "the following observation is the key to the construction :        now we can proceed with our construction . as in figure",
    "[ 3.2 ] , choose @xmath192 consecutive positioned clockwise rays @xmath193 emanating from the origin whose equations are given by the following lines @xmath194 @xmath195 note that without loss of generality we assume that @xmath98 goes along the positive direction of the @xmath15-axis .",
    "define @xmath196 to be the function between @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "let the function between @xmath165 and @xmath197 be defined as follows : @xmath198 with the convention @xmath199 .",
    "we next define : @xmath200 all partial derivatives of @xmath201 of order @xmath159 or less vanish for @xmath202 , that is , at the line @xmath203 .",
    "it remains to choose the coefficients @xmath204 in such a way that @xmath168 is glued smoothly to @xmath205 at @xmath206 , that is , so that all derivatives of order @xmath159 or less of the polynomial @xmath207 vanish at @xmath208 . by lemma  [ simple",
    "] this leads to a system of @xmath6 equations with @xmath140 unknowns @xmath209 that has a nontrivial solution .",
    "hence there exists a non - zero homogeneous polynomial @xmath168 of order @xmath6 between @xmath210 and @xmath206 which is @xmath211-smoothly glued to @xmath212 across @xmath213 and @xmath211-smoothly glued to @xmath205 across @xmath206 .",
    "finally @xmath168 is a nonzero homogeneous polynomial of order @xmath6 .",
    "thus there exists a partial derivative of @xmath168 of order @xmath6 which is a non - zero constant .",
    "in particular , its value at the origin is not zero , yet the same derivative of @xmath205 is zero .",
    "the resulting piecewise function @xmath111 does not have a derivative of order @xmath6 at the origin .",
    "the existence of the spline @xmath111 implicitly constructed above also follows from theorem 9.3 in  @xcite .",
    "indeed this theorem shows that the dimension of polynomial splines of degree @xmath6 and smoothness  @xmath159 defined over the union of @xmath13 sectors is strictly greater than @xmath214 .",
    "the latter is the dimension of bivariate polynomials .",
    "thus , there exists a spline that does not have a derivative of order @xmath6 at the origin .",
