    "experimental observations reveals synchronized oscillations of neuron networks in response to sensory stimuli in a variety of brain areas @xcite .",
    "such synchronized rhythms reflect the hierarchical organization of the brain , and occur over a wide range of both , spatial and temporal scales @xcite .",
    "complex network such as the brain are typically composed by subnetworks that are sparsely linked , leading to the appearance of clusters .",
    "typically , models for brain activity deals with clustered network with small - world architecture @xcite .",
    "certain neurons in the brain exhibit burst activity : bursts of multiple spikes followed by a rest state hyperpolarization .",
    "these bursting neurons are important in different aspects of brain function such as movement control and cognition @xcite .",
    "if the neurons possess two distinct time - scales such as spiking and bursting , the bursts ( slow time - scale ) tend to synchronize at smaller synaptic strengths @xcite .",
    "we consider two or more neurons to be bursting in a synchronized manner if they start a given burst at nearly the same time , even though the fast spiking may not be synchronized .",
    "we want to analyze the collective dynamics the a clustered network of bursting neurons and give bounds for the smallest coupling strength needed to achieve global synchronization on the bursting scale .",
    "we investigate bursting dynamics on excitatory clustered networks .",
    "close to the global synchronized state the phase dynamics of the burst may be described , to first order approximation , by a kuramoto - like model .",
    "further investigations in the kuramoto model allows us to determine the critical coupling strength to obtain burst global synchronization in terms of the probabilities of intracluster and intercluster connections .",
    "we show that the route to a global synchronized state reveals to distinct types of transitions as a function of the interclusters probabilities .",
    "if the intercluster probability is small enough then the transition to global synchronization is smooth , as opposed to higher values of the intercluster probability . in the latter case",
    "the network may present an abrupt transition to global synchronization .",
    "a small - world network has typically an average distance between nodes comparable to the value it would take on a purely random network , while retaining an appreciable degree of clustering , as in regular networks .",
    "typical brain networks also display a small - world property @xcite .",
    "we generate small - world networks following the procedure proposed by newman and watts @xcite , inserting randomly chosen shortcuts in a regular network @xcite . to verify that the coupled map network built according to procedure proposed by newman and watts has the properties of a small - world network , we have computed the so - called clustering coefficient , defined as the average fraction of pairs of neighbors of a site that happen also to be neighbors of each other , and the average separation between sites , that they are showed in fig .",

    "if @xmath11 is small enough , each network is almost independent .",
