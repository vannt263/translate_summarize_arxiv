    "in the last few years spin systems consisting of two interacting spin chains with @xmath1 , now usually called ( two - legged ) spin ladders have attracted considerable attention as recently reviewed by dagotto and rice @xcite .",
    "the spin ladder with isotropic antiferromagnetic interactions exhibits a spin gap in the excitation spectrum which has been shown to be related to the dimer gap ( af coupling on the rungs only ) as well as to the haldane gap ( strong ferromagnetic coupling on the rungs ) .",
    "it has been concluded @xcite that the isotropic spin ladder is in the same phase as the haldane chain - this can formally be described using matrix product ground states in a generalized spin ladder with additional diagonal bonds @xcite .    in the haldane chain ,",
    "the investigation of magnetic as well as nonmagnetic impurities has contributed substantially to our understanding of the system : there exist quasifree spins @xmath1 at the end of the chain segments created by the impurities as qualitatively predicted by the valence bond ground state @xcite and experimentally found in esr experiments on nenp doped with cu @xcite",
    ". we have investigated nonmagnetic impurities in spin ladders and found that these lead to effects both similar to and different from impurities in the haldane chain .",
    "the essential difference is of geometric origin : impurities in a spin ladder do not break the sequence of magnetic interactions , but create weak links : one spin @xmath1 on one leg of the ladder has no counterpart on the other leg and mediates between the adjacent regular ladder structures . in the following we use the term unpaired spin for these spins without counterpart on the opposite leg . a typical configuration with three impurities is shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] ; neighboring impurities may lead to unpaired spins on the same leg ( cis configuration ) or on opposite legs ( trans configuration ) .",
    "this structural effect that the impurities do not break the coupling along the linear arrangement is analogous to the one of impurities in a chain with nn and nnn interactions - which can actually be considered as a generalized ladder @xcite . for a statistical distribution of impurities both",
    "the sequence of cis and trans pairs and the distances between these pairs will be statistical .",
    "the distance between neighboring unpaired spins is conveniently counted by the number @xmath2 of complete rungs between them . assuming small impurity concentration @xmath3 we neglect the possibility of complete breaking of the ladder which is proportional @xmath4 .    for a microscopic understanding of the effects of a low concentration of defects on the spectrum of the spin ladder we present in the following numerical and analytical calculations for the properties of the ground state and of low - lying excited states of impure ladders with @xmath1 and all exchange interactions antiferromagnetic , isotropic and of equal magnitude ( which is set equal to unity ) .",
    "in particular we have considered :    * two spins @xmath1 in either cis or trans configuration at the edges of an open ladder formed by @xmath2 rungs ( exact diagonalization with the lanczos algorithm and analytical estimates ) , * two impurities at varying distances in either cis or trans configuration in the bulk ladder ( exact diagonalization with the lanzcos algorithm for periodic boundary conditions , dmrg calculations for open boundary conditions and estimates from matrix product states ) , * the spin ladder with many impurities ( up to six impurities in dmrg calculations and arguments based on the lieb - mattis theorem ) .",
    "our work is motivated by recent experiments @xcite on the ladder material @xmath5 doped with @xmath6 , which show a tendency of the ladder gap to vanish with increasing @xmath6 concentration .",
    "calculations for similar systems which , however , concentrate on somewhat different aspects have recently been done by motome et al @xcite and martins et al @xcite .",
    "we have performed exact diagonalizations using the lanczos technique for spin ladder systems with two defects and a varying number @xmath7 of complete rungs , i.e.  @xmath8 spins in total and have considered both periodic and open boundary conditions . for open boundary conditions we study a ladder with two impurities at the edges of the system and consequently separated by @xmath2 rungs in either cis or trans configuration . in the case of periodic boundary conditions we fix one defect on the first rung and vary the distance ( @xmath9 $ ] rungs ) to the second defect .",
    "we again consider cis and trans configurations with @xmath10 and @xmath11 rungs .",
    "for these configurations we have calculated the energies of the ground state and of low lying excitations and , for open boundary conditions only , the distribution of the magnetization .    for the normal ladder system projection of the hilbert space on the irreducible representation of the corresponding symmetry groups ( reflection and mirror symmetry , total su(2 ) invariance and , in the case of periodic boundary conditions , translational symmetry ) drastically reduces the amount of memory for diagonalization within these subspaces . as a conseqence of inserting impurities into the ladder most of these symmetries , in particular translational invariance , are no longer present and the computational effort is correspondingly larger .",
    "it is only the su(2 ) invariance of the model which is preserved .",
    "the calculations were performed on a mpp cray t3d sc256 of the zuse computing centre berlin using a parallel implementation of the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the numerical accuracy of these calculations is @xmath12 or better .    whereas the accuracy of the exact diagonalizations using the lanzcos approach is high , it can only be done for relatively small systems . to study longer chains",
    "we have used the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite . using this method",
    "we have studied open ladders from @xmath13 up to @xmath14 spins .",
    "as the defects are found to behave like spins localized on the bulk correlation length scale , defects more than 20 sites away from the ladder ends behave effectively like in an infinite system .    as good quantum number we used the total @xmath15 spin ; in configurations with defects distributed symmetrically around the ladder center , we also used parity .",
    "this allows for fast classification of states .",
    "we typically kept @xmath16 to @xmath17 block states .",
    "a remark is in order on the precision of the dmrg in this particular application . for the defect - free spin ladder ,",
    "truncation errors are very low , for @xmath16 @xmath18 and for @xmath17 @xmath19 , corresponding to an extremely small error in the energies of the defect - free system for low - energy states .",
    "the effective precision of the dmrg is however greatly reduced , when a defect or defect pair are added .",
    "the block states from the step before are not optimally chosen to represent the altered system .",
    "we find that the introduction of defects effectively reduces the precision of the dmrg by up to several orders of magnitude .",
    "this problem becomes particularly pressing in defect configurations _ nonsymmetric _ with respect to the ladder center .",
    "for any even number of defects , the ground state is the lowest eigen state in the @xmath20 sector .",
    "a nonsymmetric defect configuration implies that during the growth process there will be an odd number of defects present in some dmrg steps . the total number of spins on the ladder changes from even to odd .",
    "consequently , the ground state jumps to the @xmath21 sector , to which the available block states are not well adapted , drastically reducing the precision of the dmrg .",
    "however , the error can be greatly reduced by using the finite size dmrg algorithm @xcite : the whole chain is recalculated in the presence of the complete defect configuration without any jumps between different @xmath15 sectors .",
    "the gain in precision by far exceeds the one obtained by increasing @xmath22 .    to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider the case of a @xmath13 spin ladder with two defects in trans - configuration on rungs 24 and 26 .",
    "we have calculated the lowest eigenstates with @xmath20 and @xmath23 , keeping @xmath24 and @xmath16 states . in table",
    "[ tabdmrg ] the energies given are for the chain calculated by conventional dmrg , and after one resp .",
    "two iterations applying the finite size algorithm .",
    "obviously , even for @xmath16 the unmodified dmrg ( first line ) gives results of the order of 0.01 away from the converged result , whereas the finite size algorithm produces highly precise results even for @xmath24 ( compare results in second and third lines ) .",
    "all dmrg calculations were performed on a pentiumpro 200mhz machine running under linux .",
    "in this section we discuss the spectra and spin configurations for two unpaired spins in ladders with both open and periodic boundary conditions , presenting and comparing numerical results from both lanczos and dmrg calculations and from analytical approaches .",
    "we consider the configuration with @xmath2 rungs connecting two spins @xmath25 in either cis or trans configuration at the ends .",
    "using the lanczos algorithm we have exactly diagonalized systems with @xmath26 .",
    "we find that there is an energy gap of the order of the known ladder gap ( @xmath27 ) but the ground state is splitted into a singlet and a triplet state . as a consequence of the lieb - mattis theorem",
    "the lowest state for our configuration is a singlet if the two unpaired spins are on different sublattices ( @xmath2 even for cis spins and @xmath2 odd for trans spins ) and a triplet if they are on the same sublattice ( @xmath2 odd for cis spins and @xmath2 even for trans spins ) as discussed in ref . .",
    "we interpret this splitting as resulting from an effective interaction between the unpaired spins @xmath25 at the ladder boundaries and we derive an effective coupling by writing a hamiltonian in the subspace of these lowest two states as    @xmath28    the index @xmath29 refers to the sign of @xmath0 , i.e.antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic effective interaction respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is given in table  [ tabjopen ] and is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ resultopen ] to show its dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath31 actually is identical to the singlet - triplet splitting of the ground state .",
    "an excellent fit for @xmath32 is obtained as    @xmath33    the uncertainty in these data as determined from a least square fit is @xmath34 for @xmath35 and better for @xmath36 . due to the finite size of the open chain , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 )",
    "can not be determined with equal accuracy .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that the best fit is purely exponentially decaying and that a behavior @xmath39 can be excluded .",
    "this is in parallel to the behavior of an open haldane chain @xcite .",
    "contrary to the lanczos approach the dmrg allows to deal with sufficiently long ladders so that the two unpaired spins can be at some rather large distance and at the same time sufficiently far from the boundaries to identify their bulk interaction .",
    "the splitting of the ground state for two unpaired spins is again described by a hamiltonian as above with @xmath40 replaced by @xmath41 .",
    "the latter quantity is also given in table  [ tabjopen ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ resultopen ] .",
    "we find ( for @xmath32 )    @xmath42    @xmath43 is approximately equal to @xmath44 , but determined less accurately .",
    "we notice that @xmath45 is reduced with respect to @xmath46 by a reduction factor @xmath47 ,    @xmath48    for effectively antiferromagnetic interaction the reduction factor @xmath49 is @xmath2 independent , @xmath50 , for effectively ferromagnetic interaction it approaches this value asymptotically .",
    "this reduction will be explained quantitatively below ; qualitatively it is due to the fact that the unpaired spin projection delocalizes both into its right and left neighborhood in the bulk case whereas there are neighbors on one side only in the boundary case .",
    "the dependence of the effective exchange on distance is again purely exponential and the prediction in ref . , which includes an additional factor @xmath51 is not verified from our data .",
    "the best fit enforcing the factor @xmath51 ends up with @xmath52 , i.e.  a correlation length which is not appropriate .    using the lanczos algorithm ,",
    "we have also done exact diagonalizations for configurations with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and two spins @xmath25 in cis or trans configuration separated by @xmath53 , resp .",

    "we find that the smaller of the two values @xmath57 determines whether the ground state is singlet or triplet when the rules given above for the open ladder are used . from the graphs presented in fig .",
    "[ spectrumpbc ] it is also evident that a much larger singlet - triplet splitting of the ground state is obtained for @xmath58 even than for @xmath58 odd .",
    "the obvious reason is that the two exchange interactions which have to be added for pbc have equal ( different ) sign for @xmath58 even ( odd ) . using again the concept of an effective exchange interaction , @xmath59",
    ", we expect for two unpaired spins ( resulting from two impurities in a periodic ladder )    @xmath60    inserting the results as given before , we find that this relation is obeyed to within 10% .    in fig .",
    "[ spectrumpbc ] we also show the results for the lowest excited states , i.e.  in particular the splitting of the regular ladder gap with energy @xmath61 . for most of the defect configurations",
    "the effective interactions have different sign for the ground state and for the first excited state ( energy of the regular ladder gap ) .",
    "for example , a singlet ground state is related to a triplet as the lower one of the states of energy @xmath61 , as follows from a simple coupling of the impurities to the lowest bulk excitation with @xmath62 .",
    "this rule , however , is not strictly obeyed and a detailed discussion of the structure of the excited states in the impure ladder has to be reserved for future work .      a qualitative understanding of our numerical results for the open ladder can be obtained using matrix product wave functions as described in ref .. we consider a system with two spins at the ladder edges in trans configuration and @xmath2 rungs in between ; a wave function describing this system with four degrees of freedom can be written down as a @xmath63 matrix product ( mp ) wave function ,    @xmath64_{\\sigma , \\sigma ' } ,          \\qquad g_j = \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc }          a|t_0 \\rangle_j + b|s \\rangle_j & -a \\sqrt{2 } |t_+ \\rangle_j \\\\          a \\sqrt{2 } |t_- \\rangle_j & -(a|t_0 \\rangle_j- b|s \\rangle_j )          \\end{array } \\right ) .",

    "the value of @xmath66 is determined by minimization of the energy ; for the numerical estimates below we take the result for the infinite ladder @xcite , @xmath67 .",
    "we have chosen the two edge spins in trans configuration where a mp wave function is easily written down , whereas this is more difficult for two spins in cis configuration ( with e.g. two more spins on the upper leg than on the lower leg ) ; the latter case requires a more detailed analysis which will be published separately .",
    "instructive limiting cases of the wavefunction of eq.([mptrans ] ) are :    * for @xmath68 it is the wave function for @xmath2 singlets on the @xmath2 rungs and truly free boundary spins @xmath25 . this wave function actually is an eigenfunction to the majumdar - ghosh hamiltonian for a finite chain with @xmath69 spins and one additional free spin at each open end .",
    "their spin projections can be identified with the matrix indices @xmath70 .",
    "* for @xmath71 describes @xmath72 units with @xmath62 on the diagonals of the ladder , i.e.it is identical to the 4 eigenfunctions for the aklt chain with open ends @xcite . in this limit",
    "it is known that at the edges there exist quasifree @xmath1 spins which extend somewhat into the bulk of the ladder .",
    "note that the matrix indices @xmath70 now can no more be identified with the spin projections of the edge spins .",
    "* the general case will be intermediate and the boundary spins extend into the adjacent bulk ladder to an extent determined by the correlation length .",
    "this correlation length is underestimated by the mp ansatz but the tendency of the variation is given correctly : it decreases with increasing @xmath73 , i.e. from the aklt limit via the ladder configuration to the majumdar ghosh limit .    for a more quantitative treatment",
    "we couple the 4 mp wavefunctions @xmath74_{\\sigma,\\sigma'}$ ] , @xmath75 , to singlet , resp .  triplet states and calculate the effective exchange energy from the energy difference of these states .",
    "this leads to the following results for a configuration with @xmath2 complete rungs in between :    @xmath76    this gives the correct sign of @xmath0 ( i.e.  ferro- or antiferromagnetic if @xmath77 are on the same or on different sublattices respectively ) and a remarkably good numerical value for @xmath78 ; the decay with distance , however , is too strong , due to the fact that the correlation length is underestimated in mp states .",
    "we notice that the low energy structure of the spectrum is the generalization to spin ladders of the kennedy triplet observed in haldane chains with open boundary conditions @xcite : the latter is obtained ( in the aklt limit ) by taking @xmath79 in our wavefunction . in the ladder",
    "the wavefunction is more general than just a rvb ansatz , but the effect of the quasifree boundary spins is the same . in this sense our results",
    "are related to the results of hida @xcite who investigated the ladder with ferromagnetic coupling @xmath80 on the rungs .",
    "this coupling connects two spins which in our antiferromagnetic ladder are not coupled directly but as nnn by two af bonds ; from our calculations we see that this leads to the same effects .    an alternative approach to arrive at a theoretical estimate for @xmath31 is to integrate out the spin degrees of freedom on the rungs between the boundary spins . for this purpose",
    "we write the general hamiltonian with boundary spins @xmath81 and @xmath82 as    @xmath83    we eliminate @xmath84 and @xmath85 to first order by a suitable canonical transformation and average over the eigenstates of the complete rungs forming the intermediate part of the ladder to end up with an effective low - energy hamiltonian of the form    @xmath86    the explicit results for two and three intermediate rungs between the boundary spins are    @xmath87    these results agree to the numerical data within 20% . for two isolated spins , higher order contributions to the canonical transformation will change the numbers towards the correct values but due to isotropy and to the fact that we are dealing with @xmath1 the form of the hamiltonian will not be affected .",
    "although this approach gives only rough estimates , it serves to illustrate that for more than two unpaired spins higher order terms in the canonical transformation will lead to pair interactions between unpaired spins which are not nearest neighbors and to @xmath88-spin interactions ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the difference between the above analytical result and the numerical results should be considered as an indication that these higher spin interactions can not be neglected at the outset and a description of the impure chain in terms of an effective pair hamiltonian for unpaired spins as in ref .",
    "needs justification .",
    "we will return to this question in section iv .",
    "we now discuss in more detail the spin configuration in the presence of two unpaired spins separated by a number of rungs larger than the correlation length .",
    "then the spin projection will spread into the adjacent part of the ladder , i.e.  into the rungs to the right and to the left of its site ( or into the rungs on one side only in the case of edge spins ) . in order to demonstrate this effect for an unpaired spin with a given projection @xmath90 we consider the quantity @xmath91 , where @xmath88 is the distance from the unpaired spin ( @xmath92 denotes the unpaired spin ) and @xmath29 distinguishes between spins on the same ( + ) , resp .",
    "opposite ( - ) , sublattice as the unpaired spin .",
    "when the two unpaired spins are sufficiently separated we obtain a clear picture of the situation in the neighborhood of a single unpaired spin coupling the two unpaired spins to @xmath93 and considering states with @xmath94 .",
    "results from the dmrg and lanczos which illustrate this redistribuiton of the spin projection are shown in fig .",
    "[ spinspread ] ; all data are of the following form :    @xmath95    when the two unpaired spins are sufficiently far apart , the total spin projection @xmath96 has to be recovered , i.e.     @xmath97    for an unpaired spin in the bulk , and    @xmath98    for an unpaired spin at the edge .",
    "@xmath99 is a correction which approaches zero rapidly for @xmath100 .",
    "quantitative results from the two approaches are :    for an unpaired spin in the bulk ( from dmrg ) :    @xmath101    and for an unpaired spin at the edge ( from lanczos , after corrections for the finite size of the system , i.e.  the contributions of the second impurity ) :    @xmath102    the amplitude @xmath103 characterizes the redistribution of spin projection into the adjacent rungs and is seen to be rather large .",
    "the total excess spin on the positive sublattice is 0.894 ( bulk ) , resp .",
    "1.117 ( edge ) and on the negative sublattice -0.792 ( bulk ) , resp .",
    "-0.965 ( edge ) .",
    "we notice that the asymptotic exponential behavior governed by the correlation length is correct for all sites on the sublattice of the unpaired spin whereas it is approached within typically 5 rungs on the opposite sublattice .",
    "the numbers given above are consistent with the difference between the effective exchange constants @xmath104 and @xmath105 noticed above and give a microscopic understanding of this difference as is seen in the following way : for an unpaired spin in the bulk of the ladder the magnitudes of both @xmath106 and @xmath103 are reduced by a factor of @xmath107 as compared to an unpaired spin at the ladder edge . since the effective interaction of two unpaired spins will be determined by the tails of the spin distribution , @xmath0 will be smaller for unpaired spins in the bulk ladder by    @xmath108    consistent with the value @xmath109 found from the analysis of the energy levels above",
    ".    a redistribution of @xmath110 in the neighborhood of an unpaired edge spin is also obtained from the mp wave function above which gives    @xmath111    the behavior on the adjacent rungs is different in detail from the numerical results : @xmath112 decays with alternating sign and purely exponential with different amplitudes on the leg of the unpaired edge spin ( @xmath113 ) and on the opposite leg ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "again , the mp approach gives a reasonable qualitative picture but fails quantitatively .",
    "it is natural to assume that the results obtained for two unpaired spins can be generalized to give results for the low energy properties of the general impure ladder with impurity concentration @xmath3 by using pair exchange interactions between unpaired spins which are nearest neighbors only and determining sign and magnitude of these interactions from the results in section iii . for a random distribution of impurities",
    "this means that the impure ladder reduces to a spin chain with exchange constants which are random with respect to both sign and magnitude .",
    "this is the model used in ref .  .",
    "in this section we will investigate this assumption more closely by comparing exact ( dmrg ) spectra for various configurations with four and six impurities to spectra obtained from the assumption above .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to an even number of impurities in order to facilitate the comparison between different impurity concentration ( for an odd number of impurities the spin of the ground state will be half integer ) .",
    "a similar approach to the case of the spin - peierls substance @xmath115 with impurities has been done in ref .  .",
    "before presenting these numerical results we want to discuss some aspects of the general impure ladder with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions only and @xmath116 rungs , i.e.  @xmath117 sites , of which @xmath118 sites are occupied by nonmagnetic impurities",
    ". the ground state of the remaining @xmath119 spins @xmath1 can take values @xmath120 of total spin between @xmath121 and @xmath122 , depending on the distribution of the impurities on the two sublattices . for a random distribution of the impurities the distribution of @xmath120 is easily obtained from the theorem of lieb and mattis which states @xmath123 , where @xmath124 are the numbers of defects on the @xmath125 and @xmath126 sublattices respectively ( for configurations with two defects on the same rung , which break the ladder , this gives @xmath120 only for one out of a number of degenerate ground states ) .",
    "thus for a random distribution of defects the probability @xmath127 for a ground state to have total spin @xmath120 is    @xmath128    for @xmath129 we obtain from stirlings formula the relative weight of states with @xmath130 and @xmath93 ( @xmath131 is the total number of defect induced states )    @xmath132    the ground state spin value with largest probability therefore is @xmath62 .",
    "of particular interest are the average values of the ground state spin for a random distribution of @xmath129 impurities .",
    "they are calculated using eq .",
    "( [ spinweight ] ) to give :    @xmath133    thus the result obtained in ref .   from a random walk argument",
    "is seen to be an exact consequence of the lieb - mattis theorem . for a discussion of the low temperature susceptibility in some given defect configuration we use @xmath134 to denote the total spin of the ground state ( with zero energy ) and characterize the remaining states @xmath135 by their total spin @xmath136 and excitation energy @xmath137 .",
    "the limiting susceptibility for low magnetic fields is then given by    @xmath138    with    @xmath139    if the ground state of the impure ladder is not a singlet , i.e.  @xmath140 , leading to @xmath141 , a curie susceptibility results in the low temperature limit .",
    "for @xmath142 , leading to @xmath143 , the susceptibility shows an activated temperature dependence characteristic of a gapped system ( @xmath144 finite ) ; if the low - lying states get dense with an asymptotic density of states @xmath145 the low temperature behavior of the susceptibility changes to @xmath146 . in particular a temperature independent susceptibility results for @xmath147 , i.e.  a constant density of states ( this is the case of the @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain - actually it should be realized in this context that a concentration of @xmath148 is sufficient to turn the ladder geometry into that of a single chain ) .",
    "all these deviations from a curie behavior require a singlet ground state , which according to eq.([s0value ] ) occurs with negligible weight in the limit of a macrosocpic system .",
    "we therefore conclude that the low temperature susceptibility of the impure ladder always follows a curie law .",
    "this confirms from a different point of view the result @xmath149 which has been obtained from a renormalization group approach @xcite .",
    "when the limiting value of the curie constant for @xmath150 is calculated on the basis of the above expressions , we find that due to the random positions of the defects the factor @xmath151 ( resulting from @xmath152 for @xmath1 ) is replaced by @xmath153 .",
    "the experimentally interesting behavior at finite temperatures involves the transition between these two limiting cases , i.e.  a change in curie constant by a factor of @xmath154 .",
    "it will be determined to a large extent by the density of states .",
    "this is not easily accessible , and in the remainder of this section we present what can be learned from numerical calculations .    in fig .",

    "we want to control the effective model , 2 .",
    "we want to illustrate the filling of the gap with defect states , and 3 .",
    "we want to present the effects of the different sign combinations for defects on a given sequence of rungs .    for the comparison between the complete ladder spectra as obtained from the dmrg and the spectra of the effective model we refer to table  [ dmrgspec ] .",
    "we see that the agreement is very satisfying , deviations are generally below 10% with a tendency of better accuracy for low energies .",
    "we note that all dmrg energy spectra overestimate the true energies .",
    "further corrections will therefore rather improve the agreement between effective model and dmrg calculations .",
    "since the spectra obtained by the two approaches agree so well , in fig .",
    "[ ffimps ] dmrg spectra ( full lines ) only are given when these are available .",

    "a statistical distribution of impurities reduces the ladder , as far as its low energy spectrum is concerned ( energy range of the pure ladder gap ) , to a @xmath158 chain with random interactions , a model which has recently been used to discuss the expected low temperature properties of the impure ladder @xcite . from our calculations",
    "precise information on the parameters of the effective interactions is available . for large distances between defects",
    "the effective coupling strength is found to decay purely exponentially .",
    "we have found that it is sufficient to use two spin interactions to describe the spectrum of the effectively random chain to within 10% .",
    "the spectra which we have calculated also illustrate the beginning of the process that a random distribution of impurities with concentration @xmath3 produces a large number ( of the order of @xmath159 ) of low - lying states which will fill the ladder gap as observed experimentally @xcite . applying the lieb - mattis theorem to the impure ladder with antiferromagnetic interactions",
    "only we argue that for @xmath160 the susceptibility is characterized by a @xmath161 divergence with finite curie constant . our numerical results , however , are not sufficiently accurate to draw conclusions about the change in curie constant with increasing temperature .    from our results",
    "it becomes also clear that interactions between unpaired spins which are not nearest neighbors and @xmath162spin interactions are present and can not be neglected in the effective model at the outset .",
    "they have , however , turned out not quantitatively relevant for the low - energy spectra which we have computed .",
    "the effects of impurities on the spin distribution which we have presented show some similarity to what has been discussed in the context of impure haldane chains @xcite and it is useful to qualitatively compare these two phenomena once more : in both systems the unpaired spin at the position of the impurity shares its magnetic moment with the adjacent part of the system - and the degree of this mixing , i.e.  its spatial extent , is determined by the correlation length . in the haldane case , one deals with a physically different magnetic impurity spin ; it interacts with that part of the unpaired boundary spin which remains localized , leading to the experimentally observed splitting of the esr spectra . in the spin ladder",
    "a nonmagnetic impurity is present and the corresponding unpaired spin shares its magnetic moment with the adjacent parts of the ladder ; the tails of this magnetic moment introduce an effective interaction leading to the experimentally observable splitting of the low - energy spectrum .",
    "this work was supported by the german federal ministry of research and technology ( bmbf ) under contract number 03-mi4han-8 .",
    "we wish to thank regionales rechenzentrum niedersachsen and zuse rechenzentrum berlin for their helpful cooperation with part of the numerical calculations ."
