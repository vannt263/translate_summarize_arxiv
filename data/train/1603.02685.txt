    "the observations of rotational velocities of spiral galaxies reveal significant discrepancies from newtonian theory such that the observed and predicted , using the observed baryonic matter , kinematics always do not match @xcite . according to newtonian gravity , the rotational velocity falls with distance from the center of a galaxy ( the so - called keplerian fall - off ) , while the observed data usually show an asymptotically flat rotation curve out to the furthest observationally accessible data points .",
    "one solution to solve this problem is assuming a dark matter halo distributed around each galaxy @xcite .",
    "dark matter had also been inferred to contribute significantly on larger scales in the universe from the large velocity dispersions observed in galaxy clusters by @xcite in the 1930s , gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters such as the bullet cluster , the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies , and more recently by the pattern of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "although the currently favored cold dark matter ( cdm ) model is understood to be successful on large scales ( but see @xcite ) , after much experimental effort up to date , no direct evidence for the existence of dark matter has been found . moreover high resolution n - body simulations of structure formation remain in contradiction with observations and predict significantly more satellites than seen and also a wrong spatial distribution of sub - halos ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have compared the predictions of the concordance cosmological model of the structures in the environment of large spiral galaxies with observed properties of local group galaxies and have shown that there exist prominent observational challenges for the cdm model , which might point towards the necessity of an alternative model .",
    "this inspires astronomers and physicists to search for other explanations of the discrepancy between the newtonian dynamical mass and the luminous mass .",
    "an alternative approach is to replace cold dark matter ( cdm ) by a modification of the newtonian dynamics known as mond @xcite , ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) . within this classical milgromian dynamics framework ,",
    "the newtonian gravitational acceleration @xmath0 is replaced in the spherically symmetric case with @xmath1 when the gravitational acceleration is far smaller than the critical acceleration @xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "bekenstein s ( 2004 ) teves theory was a mile stone in providing a consistent relativistic foundation by introducing a tensor , a vector , and a scalar field into the field equations . for an alternative approach to modified gravity",
    "see moffat ( 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "rotation curves of spiral galaxies have been studied for several decades now , and provide a valuable body of data to determine the radial dependency of the gravitational forces in galactic scales .",
    "indeed milgromian dynamics is scale - invariant and thus yields flat rotation curves ( milgrom 2000 ; see also wu & kroupa 2015 ; kroupa 2015 ) and the tully - fisher relation , which is not well understood in the context of dark matter . ] using only the observed distribution of visible matter and reasonable assumptions about the stellar mass - to - light ratio as input data @xcite . when milgromian dynamics was proposed , rotation curves of a few high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies had been observed . since then , however , rotation curves for low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have become available which provide a more stringent and successful test of the prediction of milgromian dynamics than the earlier data .",
    "although the flattening of galactic rotation curves was one of the first evidence of dark matter , a detailed comparison between mond and cdm @xcite predictions for a sample of spiral galaxies with accurately measured rotation curves concluded that the cdm hypothesis fails to reproduce observed rotation curves ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but on the other hand , mond tightly fits the observations without dark matter in different types of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) and provides the best available description .",
    "it should be emphasized that in mond , rotation curves are constructed with only one slightly adjustable parameter , the stellar mass - to - light ratio , while in most cdm models , two additional model parameters are needed to describe the dark component .",
    "@xcite constructed rotation curves of a large sample of galaxies from the distribution of their detectable matter through a set of different gravity models . while the different models reproduce the observed data with reasonable detail , on a deeper examination , they found significant disparities in their predictions of stellar mass - to - light , @xmath3 , ratios and showed that the stellar population synthesis , sps , analysis and the color @xmath3 correlation predicted therein through various initial mass functions ( imf ) could differentiate between the models .",
    "mond also has been formulated as a generalization of the poisson equation for the newtonian gravitational field . as a result of the nonlinearity of this formulation",
    ", the strong equivalence principle is violated in mond when considering the external field in which a system is embedded ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the internal gravitational dynamics of a system embedded in an external field depends on both the internal and external gravitational field .",
    "this so - called external field effect ( efe ) which is totally absent in newtonian dynamics , is a decisive factor to discriminate between these two dynamics .",
    "the efe allows high velocity stars to escape from the potential of the milky way @xcite and reduces the global velocity dispersion of globular clusters . in mond ,",
    "the internal gravity of a satellite galaxy of the milky way is determined not only by the satellite s stellar distribution ( and therefore mass distribution ) , but also by the local strength of the milky way s gravitational field . for",
    "a simple introduction to the efe see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite investigated analytically the solution for a point mass immersed in a dominating constant external gravitational field .",
    "they found that the efe breaks the spherical symmetry of the potential of a single point - mass , such that the angle between the external field direction and the direction towards the point - mass plays an important role in the total potential . as a result",
    ", the gravity due to the mass is not always directed towards it .",
    "since spiral galaxies may be influenced by the external fields of other nearby galaxies or by the host cluster of galaxies , generally , one can not ignore the efe in the analysis of rotation curves .",
    "in most studies of rotation curves of spiral galaxies in mond that have been done up to now , the authors ignored the external field effect . @xcite",
    "have considered this effect for three tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) .",
    "they considered the efe to show that the mond framework is very likely to correctly explain the kinematics of the tdgs .",
    "@xcite calculated the rotation curve of the mw within the mond framework , allowing for various values of the external field .",
    "recently , @xcite applied the external field effect to predict the masses of galaxies in the proximity of the dwarf galaxies compiled by @xcite assuming they are embedded in an external field of a companion galaxy or a cluster of galaxies .",
    "most recently , @xcite presented an analysis of the galactic rotation curves taking into account the efe and showed that the efe can significantly improve some galactic rotation curve fits by decreasing the predicted velocities of the external part of the rotation curves .",
    "although mond successfully reproduces the observed rotation curves of a large sample of galaxies , there are some galaxies with declining rotation curves in the outer parts not favorable to mond .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the rotation curves of a sample of galaxies with a wide range of luminosities and morphologies from dwarf irregulars to bright spirals under the mondian efe .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : the basics of mond and the efe are discussed in sections [ basic ] and [ efe ] , respectively .",
    "we describe the rotation curve data of a sample of galaxies in section [ data ] .",
    "in section [ fit ] we produce the rotation curve fits to the used sample of galaxies under the influence of the efe .",
    "this is followed by a presentation of the results of fits in section [ result ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in the non - relativistic version of mond , the acceleration of an isolated system , @xmath4 is related to the newtonian acceleration @xmath0 through the following relation :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is an interpolation function which runs smoothly from @xmath7 at @xmath8 to @xmath9 at @xmath10 .",
    "the standard interpolating function is @xmath11 , but @xcite suggested the simple function @xmath12 , which provides a better fit to the rotation curve of the milky way . the simple function is compatible with the relativistic theory of mond ( teves ) put forward by @xcite .",
    "the typical value for the parameter @xmath13 , obtained from an analysis of a sample of spiral galaxies with high - quality rotation curves , is @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that using the simple function leads to a slightly different value of @xmath15 .",
    "the first value corresponds to @xmath16 and the second value to @xmath17 .    for the standard interpolating function ,",
    "one can obtain the mond acceleration , @xmath18 in terms of the newtonian acceleration @xmath19 as follow :    @xmath20    here , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the radius and @xmath23 , includes the total stellar disk , bulge , and gaseous disk , respectively .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are determined by photometric observations , can be scaled according to the chosen , or fitted , stellar mass - to - light ( @xmath3 ) ratio .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is derived from hi observations , when they are available .",
    "therefore , rotation curves in mond can be expressed as :    @xmath27",
    "in the context of mond , the internal dynamics of a stellar system is affected both by the internal and external fields , due to the violation of the strong equivalence principle @xcite . in classical newton / einstein gravity ,",
    "the situation is entirely different , i.e. , a uniform external field does not affect the internal dynamics of a stellar system . if the external field becomes comparable to or larger than @xmath13 , a galaxy embedded in this external field will always be in the newtonian regime , even if the internal accelerations are low . in practice , no objects are truly isolated in the universe and they may be influenced by other systems ( e.g. , from a nearby galaxy , or large scale structure ) . as a consequence of the efe , the predicted velocities of the outer part of the rotation curves of galaxies where the internal acceleration becomes equal to the external acceleration , decreases @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the truncation of the phantom dark matter halo @xcite .    for a galaxy with a density distribution @xmath28 which is embedded in a host galaxy cluster ( or located nearby another galaxy ) with a density distribution @xmath29",

    "one way to solve eq .",
    "[ mon1 ] is then to assume that the total acceleration is the sum of the internal @xmath34 and the external @xmath35 acceleration which both satisfy the generalized poisson equation as @xcite ,    @xmath36 = 4\\pi g \\rho_g . \\label{mon2}\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "[ mon2 ] , the direction of the external acceleration is important for the dynamics of stars in the clusters .",
    "for example , for two stars the acceleration would be different if @xmath35 is parallel or orthogonal to their internal acceleration .",
    "several attempts to solve the generalized milgromian poisson equation considering the efe have been done .",
    "@xcite simulated an isolated object with a static milgromian potential solver , but changed the boundary condition on the outermost grid point to be nonzero . @xcite",
    "estimated the escape velocity of galaxies in milgromian dynamics and assumed @xmath37 . as a first order test they replaced @xmath38 with @xmath39 , or @xmath40",
    "this is an approximation , which reduces a 3-dimensional problem to a one - dimensional one , neglecting the general relative orientations of the acceleration vectors ( i.e. a possible angular difference between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .    using the milgromian dynamics n - body code , nmody @xcite",
    ", @xcite calculated the evolution of globular cluster - scale stellar systems under the influence of the external field of a host galaxy by adding the constant external gravitational field to the internal acceleration inside the @xmath43-function , considering the different angle between external and internal acceleration for all stars throughout the evolution .",
    "this method was the first attempt to include the efe in the milgromian dynamics n - body code to investigate the internal evolution of non - isolated stellar systems .",
    "the implied phase - transition of a star cluster moving away from its host galaxy has been studied by @xcite .",
    "our sample includes a collection of 18 galaxies , taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , spans a wide range of luminocities and morphological types from faint gas - rich dwarfs to bright spiral galaxies .",
    "they are listed in table 1 and shown in fig .",
    "the sample includes several gas dominated low - surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , e.g. ddo 154 and ic 2574 that show large discrepancies between visible mass and their dynamical mass which makes them ideal objects to test mond .",
    "there are also a number of high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies with a massive stellar component and a low gas content with well - extended rotation curves , e.g. , ngc 4100 , and ngc 5033 .",
    "contrary to the lsbs with slowly rising rotation curves , the rotation curves of hsbs rise steeply to a maximum and decline slowly into an almost horizontal asymptote .",
    "nine galaxies of the sample are part of things that are observed in hi with the very large array in the b , c and d configurations @xcite , and their rotation curves are derived by @xcite .",
    "nine other members of the sample are taken from the galaxies used in the mond fits of @xcite .",

    "three of the galaxies listed in table 1 have a central bulge and are treated differently , to be explained shortly .    , in newtonian and mond dynamics and in different external gravitational fields ( @xmath35 ) in units of @xmath13 .",
    "rotation curves of a galaxy embedded in a stronger external field ( @xmath44 ) show the return to a keplerian behavior at large radii .",

    "to calculate the mond rotation curves we used the same method as used in @xcite . however , in principle , the milgromian dynamics poisson equation should be used to calculate the milgromian dynamics circular speed , but @xcite has shown that the results derived for the field equation slightly differ ( @xmath46 ) from those using the original milgromian dynamics prescription . the first step is to determine the newtonian acceleration of the detectable matter , @xmath0 via the classical poisson equation .",
    "the stellar and gaseous mass distribution are assumed to be in a thin disk .",
    "we corrected for the mass fraction of helium by scaling the hi mass by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "we assume the hi gas is in co - planer rotation about the center of the galaxy , an assumption which may not hold in galaxies with strong bars @xcite .",
    "given the newtonian acceleration , the effective acceleration without efe and corresponding rotational velocity is calculated from the mond formulae , i.e. , eqs .",
    "[ amond2 ] and [ v2 ] , respectively .",
    "we assume that the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath3 ) is constant with radius , throughout the galaxy , though this is not strictly the case , because of the color gradient in spiral galaxies . the integrated galactic initial mass function ( igimf ) theory @xcite provides a computable quantification of the radial variation of the imf in a disk galaxy , and age and metallicity gradients also imply a radially changing @xmath47 value .",
    "this is to be studied in the future .    using the standard interpolation function and considering the efe",
    ", a little algebra shows that the circular speed for mond can be expressed as :    @xmath48    [ efe - fit ]    where , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 the newtonian contribution of the stellar disk , bulge and gas to the rotation curve , respectively . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the stellar mass - to - light ratios of the disk and the bulge .",
    "how @xmath55 depends on the efe is demonstrated in fig . 1 ( see sec . 6.1 ) .",
    "as an approximation to the mond rotation curve , we used the 1-d version of eq .",
    "[ mon2 ] which has been shown to be a good approximation of the true 3-d version @xcite and we assume that @xmath35 is perpendicular to the disk - plane of the galaxy .    to fit the observational velocity curve with the theoretical model we employ the @xmath56 goodness - of - fit test .",
    "fitting of the calculated rotation curves to the observed data points is achieved by adjusting the @xmath3 ratio and the external gravitational field ( in the case of a fit with the efe ) , by minimizing the reduced least - squares value @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the observational uncertainty in the rotation speeds and @xmath59 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "@xmath60 is the number of observed velocity values along the radial direction in a galaxy .",

    "here , in this section we present the results of milgromian dynamics fits . before addressing the milgromian dynamics rotation curves ,",
    "first we assess the general effect of the external field on the shape of a rotation curve in milgromian dynamics .",
    "an external gravitational field on a galaxy can be induced by nearby galaxies or clusters of galaxies in which the galaxy is embedded , and consequently it can cause a suppression of the boost to gravity due to mond such that the rotation curve become newtonian . particularly , low surface brightness galaxies ( with internal acceleration much smaller than @xmath13 ) are more affected than others .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to demonstrate the efe on the shape of a typical rotation curve , for different values of the external gravitational field ( in the range @xmath610.1 to 10 @xmath13 ) , we calculate the circular velocity of a galaxy using eq . 6 that consists of two idealized stellar components including a disc potential given by @xmath62 and a central bulge , given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 kpc , @xmath66 kpc , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 kpc .",
    "there is a remarkable difference in predicted rotational velocity in mond with different values of @xmath35 as shown in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the efe has a significant effect on the rotational velocities at the outskirts of galaxies . in",
    "all rotation curves the milgromian dynamics velocity curves lie above the newtonian one .",
    "as the external field gets stronger the rotation curve shifts to the newtonian prediction . in particular , the external field erases the flat behavior of the rotational velocity in the outer parts .",
    "as will be discussed with more detail in the next section , the efe leads to a higher mass - to - light ratio in milgromian dynamics because of the weakening of the effect of milgromian dynamics by pushing the rotation curve towards the newtonian curve , especially in the outer parts .",
    "an unphysical fit to a given falling rotation curve would thus require an unphysically large @xmath3 ratio .",
    "this allows us to assess if fits which are formally good are also physically acceptable .      in this section",
    "we compare the calculated circular velocity curves in the framework of milgromian dynamics in two different regimes ( with and without the efe ) with the observed rotation curves .",
    "first we perform milgromian dynamics fits neglecting the efe by fitting eq .",
    "[ v2 ] to the observed rotation curves with a least square algorithm such that p=1 in eq . 7 .",
    "the milgromian dynamics acceleration is fixed at its standard value ( @xmath69 ) and milgromian dynamics fits are made with only the @xmath3 ratio as a single free parameter in this case .    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we show the results of the one - parameter mond fits of theoretically constructed rcs to the observations of 18 galaxies . in each panel ,",
    "the measured rotational velocities are indicated as red points with error - bars and the best - fitting milgromian dynamics rcs without the efe are shown by blue - dotted lines .",
    "the stellar disk and gas contributions are represented as the pink dotted - line and green dashed line , respectively . in tables [ t1 ] and [ t2 ] , we summarize the key results of the fitted rcs , that is , @xmath56 , and the implied @xmath3 ratios of the stellar components .",
    "three galaxies have a prominent bulge component .",
    "one expects a bulge with an older population of stars to have a higher @xmath3 ratio than a disk with a younger population .",
    "therefore , to obtain a more realistic representation for these galaxies , we have allowed the model to choose different @xmath3s for the disk and the bulge .",
    "the result , shown in table [ t1 ] , confirms the expectation . for ngc 4736 and 5055 , @xmath70 , suggesting the bulge to be older than the disk , as is observed for the mw .",
    "however , for ngc 3031 @xmath71 which may arise if its bulge is younger that the disk suggesting a possibility to test this prediction by further observation .    discrepancies between the rcs predicted by milgromian dynamics without the efe and the observed one are seen for most of the galaxies in the sample . in particular ,",
    "milgromian dynamics without the efe provides acceptable fits ( @xmath72 ) for only 5 out of the 18 galaxies in our sample ( i.e. , ngc 2366 , ngc 3621 , ngc 3769 , ngc 4183 , ugc 6983 ) , and for the other 13 galaxies , mond overestimates the rotation velocities of larger @xmath73 .",
    "the obtained best - fitting milgromian dynamics rcs including the efe are also indicated by the thick lines .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows that there is an observable difference between milgromian dynamics in rcs with and without the efe . in all",
    "rcs the velocity curve of mond with the efe is above the milgromian dynamics one without the efe in the central part of the galaxies , but falls underneath in the outer parts ( see e.g. , ugc 6446 and ugc 6983 in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . adding the efe improves the rcs fits in all galaxies .",
    "the efe improves the rotation curve fits of 14 out of the 18 galaxies in the sample ( i.e. , achieves an acceptable fit with @xmath72 ) . in roughly half of the galaxies ( ddo 154 , ic 2574 , ngc 3198 , ngc 5533 , ngc 5033 , ngc 2998 , ngc 4183 , ugc 6983 , and ugc 6446 )",
    "for which the quality of the fit was quiet poor when neglecting the efe , the rotation curves fit significantly improved such that the corresponding values of @xmath56 decrease by a factor of 2 or 3 .",
    "in particular , for the cases that the milgromian dynamics ( without efe ) curve falls bellow the observed rotation curve in the inner part , and above the rotation curve in the outer region the efe helps to improve the quality of the milgromian dynamics fit to the observation . the case of the galaxy ugc 6446 ( fig . [ f2 ] ) is a very interesting example .",
    "as can be seen , the fit is improved at both small radii because of an increase of the inner part of the rotation curve owing to the increasing of the @xmath3 ratio in milgromian dynamics with the efe and also in the outer part where the rotational speed decreases due to the efe .",

    "the overall trend is similar - the redder the galaxy , the higher the @xmath3 , but the values generally scatter around the models .",
    "we see that the @xmath3 values lie within the range set by a salpeter and a kroupa imf for stars with masses between 0.1 and 100 @xmath76 . according to table 2 , and the color-@xmath3 relation in the k - band , i.e. , @xmath77 @xcite , interestingly there are three cases ( ddo 154 , ic 2574 , and ngc 2366 ) for which the implied @xmath3 ratio from the milgromian dynamics fit without the efe is dramatically lower than the prediction of the sps models . including the efe , the @xmath3 ratios from the mond fits for these three cases are in the reasonable range and in agreement with the prediction of sps models .",

    "indeed , an impressive result from the mond + efe modelling presented here is that the @xmath3 values required to fit the observed rotation curves are well consistent with those of sps models , providing a further consistency test that milgromian dynamics is indeed the correct effective approach in the ultra - weak field gravitational limit . this issue of stellar populations will be addressed in a forthcoming contribution more closely . * we used the efe to constrain the possible source of the gravitational field surrounding each individual galaxy in our sample .",
    "we thus propose that including the efe can be used to resolve the central surface brightness- mond acceleration constant correlation that has been discussed by some authors @xcite , in the sense that the galaxies with higher surface brightness require a higher value of @xmath13 and galaxies with a lower surface brightness tend to have lower @xmath13 .",
    "this is because , adding the efe or decreasing @xmath13 have almost a similar impact , and both lead to the rotation curve of a galaxy bending downwards .",

    "<S> unlike newtonian dynamics which is linear and obeys the strong equivalence principle , in any nonlinear gravitation such as milgromian dynamics ( mond ) , the strong version of the equivalence principle is violated and the gravitational dynamics of a system is influenced by the external gravitational field in which it is embedded . </S>",
    "<S> this so called external field effect ( efe ) is one of the important implications of mond and provides a special context to test milgromian dynamics . here , we study the rotation curves ( rcs ) of 18 spiral galaxies and find that their shapes constrain the efe . we show that the efe can successfully remedy the overestimation of rotation velocities in 80% of the sample galaxies in milgromian dynamics fits by decreasing the velocity in the outer part of the rcs . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the implied external field with the gravitational field for non - negligible nearby sources of each individual galaxy and find that in many cases it is compatible with the efe within the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore argue that in the framework of milgromian dynamics , one can constrain the gravitational field induced from the environment of galaxies using their rcs . </S>",
    "<S> we finally show that taking into account the efe yields more realistic values for the stellar mass - to - light ratio in terms of stellar population synthesis than the ones implied without the efe .    </S>",
