    "the rutheno - cuprate @xmath2 ( ru-1222 ) and @xmath3 ( ru-1212 ) families have attracted considerable interest by the coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity in these compounds @xcite .",
    "the magnetic ordering of the ru moments occurs at a temperature around 100 k , while the superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) is usually no higher than 50 k. the fact that superconductivity occurs in the @xmath4 planes , while the magnetic order is related with the _ ru _ ions , casts some doubt about the genuine coexistence of these two phenomena at a microscopic level . also , the exact nature of the magnetic order is still in debate . in this context , the role played by the oxygen non - stoichiometry in the determination of the magnetic and superconducting properties of these compounds is still not completely clear @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the large number of oxygen vacancies observed in ru-1222 , bigger than in ru-1212 @xcite , was associated with the presence of a spin glass ( sg ) behavior observed in ru-1222 samples @xcite .",
    "although reports on the oxygen doping in ru-1222 can be found in the literature @xcite , the possible correlation of oxygen stoichiometry and the appearance of the sg phase was not explored yet .",
    "in fact , this has been one of the motivations for the present work .",
    "we have studied polycrystalline samples of ru-1222 with different oxygen doping levels by performing magnetization , ac susceptibility and resistivity measurements . for oxygen depleted samples we observed a large variation in the resistivity and a suppression of the superconducting transition , while the magnetic order , above @xmath1 , showed a subtle qualitative modification .",
    "a significant variation in the measured properties of the samples was also observed as a function of time , which may help to explain some contradictory results reported in the literature .",
    "samples of composition @xmath2 were synthesized through a solid - state reaction route .",
    "high purity @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 were mixed in the stoichiometric proportions and calcinated at 1000 , 1020 , 1040 and 1050 @xmath10 each for 24 hours with intermediate grindings .",
    "one pellet was annealed in a flow of high pressure oxygen ( 100 atm ) at 420 @xmath10 for 100 hours and labeled as o@xmath11-annealed .",
    "two other pellets were annealed in air for 48 hours at 1050 @xmath10 ( labeled as air - annealed ) .",
    "one of them was further annealed in nitrogen at 420 @xmath10 for 24 hours ( n@xmath11-annealed ) . in this way it was possible to vary the oxygen content in the studied samples .",
    "though the actual oxygen content of the samples were not determined , qualitatively the same should be maximum for 100 atm o@xmath11 annealed , moderate for air annealed and minimum for the n@xmath11-annealed sample .",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns were obtained at room temperature for all three samples ( mac science : mxp18vahf@xmath12 ; cu__k__@xmath13 radiation ) .",
    "the ac susceptibility measurements were performed in a commercial ppms ( physical properties measurement system ) , while for the dc measurements a squid magnetometer mpms-5 was employed , both equipments made by quantum design company . for the resistivity measurements the four - point technique was used .",
    "analysis of the xrd patterns ( fig .",
    "1 ) revealed that all three samples crystallize in a tetragonal structure ( space group _ i4/mmm _ ) with the following lattice parameters for o@xmath11- , air- and n@xmath11-annealed samples , respectively : @xmath14   and @xmath15  ; @xmath16   and @xmath17  ; and @xmath18   and @xmath19  .",
    "the increase in the lattice parameters from the o@xmath11- to the n@xmath20-annealed samples indicates that the different annealings are not only affecting the grain boundaries but leading to an overall reduction in the oxygen content in the bulk of the air- and n@xmath11-annealed samples .",
    "small impurity peaks were observed in the xrd patterns , which are the same for all samples . despite the presence of these impurity peaks ,",
    "our samples may be considered to be of very good quality if compared to those reported in the literature by several authors @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetization for all three samples is presented in fig .",
    "the samples were cooled in zero magnetic field down to the lowest accessible temperature ( 2 k ) .",
    "after temperature stabilization , a magnetic field of 50 oe was applied and the magnetization recorded as the temperature was raised ( zfc curve ) up to 200 k. then the temperature was decreased back to 2 k , keeping the same applied magnetic field , and the fc curve was obtained .",
    "the zfc curves show a pronounced peak at 68 k , 84 k and 92 k for o@xmath11- , air- and n@xmath11-annealed samples , respectively , while the fc curves show a monotonical increase with the reduction of the temperature . besides the shift to higher temperatures of the peak in the zfc curve",
    ", its height also increase with the reduction in the oxygen content of the samples , going from 0.58 emu / g for the o@xmath11- annealed sample to 0.67 emu / g for n@xmath11- annealed one . in the sg scenario ,",
    "the frustration of the antiferromagnetic interaction is believed to be associated with the presence of disorder due to the large number of oxygen vacancies in this compound @xcite .",
    "thus , an increase in the number of oxygen vacancies would lead to a more disordered system , favoring the occurrence of the sg phase at higher temperatures .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the results presented in fig .",
    "2 . a small antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition can be detected at higher temperatures , around 174 k for all samples ,",
    "although this transition becomes less pronounced with the reduction in oxygen content . at temperatures between the afm transition ( @xmath21 k ) and the sg freezing point ( @xmath22 k ) a small irreversibility can be observed .",
    "as shown in the insets of fig .",
    "2 , the irreversibility is greatly reduced for the air - annealed sample and it is almost completely absent in the n@xmath11-annealed sample .",
    "these results point to the simultaneous occurrence of an ordered phase ( afm ) and a disordered or frustrated phase @xcite , whose configurations freeze into a sg at tf @xmath2380 k. it is likely that as oxygen vacancies are introduced in the sample , a larger fraction of the same becomes disordered favoring the sg phase at the expenses of the afm phase .",
    "in fact , the almost reversible magnetization curve observed for the n@xmath11-annealed sample , above the sg freezing temperature @xmath24 , exhibits the expected behavior of a prevailing sg phase @xcite .",
    "3 presents the temperature dependence of the real part of the complex ac susceptibility @xmath25 , measured with the same routines employed to obtain the magnetization curves .",
    "the measurements were performed at an applied field of @xmath26 oe and revealed well defined peaks at temperatures @xmath27",
    "k@xmath28 @xmath29 k and @xmath30 k for o@xmath11- , air- and n@xmath11-annealed samples , respectively .",
    "the position of these peaks defines the freezing temperature of the spin system , where the zfc and fc curves branch apart from each other in the magnetization measurements ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . for the ac susceptibility ,",
    "the zfc and fc curves are almost identical for all three samples , except for temperatures in the 40 - 90 k range . for these temperatures a small irreversibility",
    "is observed for all samples , being more pronounced for the air - annealed sample and less pronounced for the o@xmath11-annealed sample .",
    "a clear feature present in these curves is a sudden decrease in @xmath31 , associated with the superconducting transition .",
    "we see that the superconducting phase is strongly suppressed by the reduction of the oxygen content in the samples .",
    "both the transition temperature and the superconducting fraction are reduced until the complete suppression for the n@xmath11-annealed samples , which does not present superconductivity down to 2 k.    the frequency dependence of the peak in @xmath31 as a function of the temperature is a clear signature of a sg phase . to check this we repeated the @xmath32 measurements for three different frequencies , for all samples . for the sake of brevity ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 only the results for the n@xmath11-annealed sample .",
    "similar results were found also for the other samples . as observed in fig .",
    "4 , the peak shifts to lower temperatures and its intensity increases as the frequency of the excitation field is decreased , which is the expected behavior for a sg system @xcite .",
    "the results obtained through magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements show unequivocally the presence of a sg phase in all three samples studied , being more noticeable in the oxygen depleted ones . on the other hand",
    ", a reduction in the oxygen content suppresses both the superconducting phase ( below @xmath24 ) and the fraction of the sample that presents afm order ( above @xmath24 ) .",
    "the imaginary component of the complex susceptibility also presents a peak associated with the glassy transition , as can be observed in fig .",
    "5 . this peak occurs about 3 k below the corresponding peak in @xmath31 and is weakly frequency - dependent , as expected for a sg phase @xcite .",
    "however , a second peak appears at 42.9 k , 57.7 k and 65.7 k for the o@xmath11- , air- and n@xmath11-annealed samples , respectively , as shown in fig . 5 for a frequency of the driving field of 1000 hz .",
    "this peak is strongly frequency - dependent , being more intense and shifted to higher temperatures as the frequency is increased , as shown for the n@xmath11-annealed sample in fig .",
    "it is important to notice that the strong frequency dependence of this second peak contrasts with the very weak frequency dependence observed for the sg peak , clearly indicating that it has a different origin .",
    "it shows a more intense signal in the fc branch , if compared with the zfc branch , thus revealing a strong irreversibility .",
    "also , the temperature range where this peak and the irreversibility appear in the @xmath33 measurements coincide with the irreversibility observed in @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . for the o@xmath11 sample",
    "this peak could tentatively be associated with the superconducting transition , which occurs at a close temperature .",
    "however , the same is not true for the other two samples . for the air - annealed sample , for instance",
    ", the peak related to the superconducting transition is located about 47 k below the second peak position .",
    "a more likely explanation for the irreversibility and the second peak in @xmath33 could be associated with the rotation of spins or spin - clusters , due to the excitation field applied during the ac susceptibility measurements .",
    "a recent report on samples of the family ru-1222 shows @xcite that for temperatures in between 30 and 80 k , depending of the exact sample composition , the hysteresis loops are very narrow , with the coercivity field ( @xmath34 ) being zero at a certain temperature within this interval .",
    "this coincides very well with the temperature range where we found an irreversible behavior in our @xmath33 measurements .",
    "if @xmath34 is small enough , then the amplitude of our ac magnetic field ( 1 oe ) could rotate the existing magnetic domains . since this spin rotation is a dissipative process , one should expect an increase in the dissipation ( and then in @xmath33 ) which could peak when @xmath35 .",
    "also , it was shown that the coercive field is larger for samples annealed in high pressure of oxygen , compared with as grown samples @xcite .",
    "therefore it can be inferred that this peak in @xmath33 should be stronger for oxygen depleted samples , in full agreement with our data ( see fig .",
    "although no clear change at this temperature can be detected in the magnetization curves ( fig .",
    "1 ) for any of the three samples , it is possible to argue that this peak indicates a re - arrangement of the spins in the sample , going from a more disordered state ( sg phase ) to a more ordered weak - ferromagnetic ( w - fm ) state .",
    "our results alone are insufficient to clearly identify such re - ordering of the spins , however recent results on zero field muon spin rotation ( zf-@xmath36sr ) have shown two different internal fields at low temperatures , one vanishing at temperatures above 90 k and the second one at 80 k @xcite .",
    "another important property strongly affected by the change in the oxygen content of the samples is their resistivity , as shown in fig .",
    "7 . by reducing the oxygen content of the sample both the resistivity and its variation with temperature increase ( see fig .",
    "7(a ) ) . all samples present an exponential growth of resistivity with decreasing temperature . at low temperatures",
    "the behavior changes : for the o@xmath11 and air annealed samples , the superconducting transition can be undoubtedly identified , while for the n@xmath11 samples the resistivity continues to increase at an even higher rate .",
    "a different result was obtained when we repeated these measurements after a few months . a clear increase in the resistivity was observed , indicating a possible continuous loss of oxygen by the samples , which were kept in a dessecator all the time . after 5 months",
    "( see fig .",
    "7(b ) ) , the resistivity measurements for the air - annealed sample ( open squares ) is similar to the result previously obtained for the n@xmath11 sample , showing no sign of superconductivity . to evaluate if this sample degradation could be due to oxygen loss only , we tried to recover the original state of the air - annealed sample by annealing it in an oxygen atmosphere .",
    "our attempts to re - oxygenate the sample in a 1 atm of oxygen atmosphere for 100 hours at 450 @xmath37c and 100 hours at 800 @xmath37c did not produce any meaningful change in its properties",
    ". then it was annealed again for 100 hours at 420 @xmath37c in 70 atm of o@xmath11 .",
    "the resistivity curve obtained after oxygenation , shown in fig 7(b ) as crossed squares , presented a drastic reduction in its slope , becoming similar to the curve for the o@xmath11-annealed sample .",
    "nevertheless , the superconductivity could not be restored at all . after a second annealing , performed under the same conditions as the previous one , the superconducting transition",
    "could then be partially recovered in this sample ( fig 7(b ) , solid squares ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath38 k indicates that even after both annealings the sample still remains underdoped .",
    "interestingly , the normal state resistivity for the sample after both annealings processes shows a steeper change in resistivity with the decrease in temperature . an @xmath39 curve for @xmath26 oe ( zfc followed by fc ) was also measured for the re - oxygenated sample as shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the basic features previously observed for the oxygen annealed sample are all present , including the irreversibility observed at temperatures immediately above the onset of the sg peak and the afm transition at @xmath40 k ( see inset of fig . 8) .",
    "both resistivity and magnetic measurements indicate that the oxygen content in the sample increased with the annealings but they were not enough to fully re - oxygenate the sample .",
    "the fact that the resistivity is strongly affected by the degradation of the sample and by its re - oxygenation , while the changes in magnetization and susceptibility are more subtle , seems to indicate that both processes affect primarily the grain boundaries .",
    "however , the complete suppression of the superconductivity , not detected even by inductive measurements , and the change in the afm transition for the degraded samples , point to the relevance of processes occurring in the bulk of the grains .",
    "our results indicate that although the oxygen can easily leave the sample , the reverse process of re - oxygenation is quite tricky and difficult .",
    "also , the oxygen content of ru-1222 samples can change with time and that ageing process could be the origin for many discrepancies between results reported in the literature .",
    "for instance , the valence of the ruthenium ions is known to be affected by the change in oxygen content @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that not only the synthesis process may be responsible for the different values of ru valence reported in the literature , due to the different initial oxygen content of the samples .",
    "the time delay between the samples preparation and their measurements could also strongly affect the results .",
    "the magnetic properties of ru-1222 are very complex , with different magnetic transitions and possible phase separation .",
    "the significant role played by oxygen vacancies is still under study and would be benefited by a careful comparison of works from different groups .",
    "it is important to compare results obtained by different techniques in an attempt to reach a better understanding on the interesting properties of this rutheno - cuprate family .",
    "recently , felner et al .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed mssbauer study of ru-1222 where they observed two magnetic transitions .",
    "the first was an afm transition at 160 k , and the second was identified as the onset of a w - fm order at around 90 k. interestingly , only 10 - 20% of the sample volume orders",
    "antiferromagnetically while its major fraction presents a magnetic order only below 90 k. these results gave strong support to the idea of magnetic phases separation in ru-1222 polycrystalline samples @xcite .",
    "further , the mssbauer spectra was rather broad and more than one sub - spectra , besides the one associated with the small afm fraction , was necessary to fit the experimental results , indicating some degree of disorder or inhomogeneity in the sample .",
    "both central conclusions presented in that work , the occurrence of phase separation and the presence of disorder / inhomogeinity are consistent with our results .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by shengelaya et al .",
    "@xcite based on muon spin rotation ( @xmath36sr ) experiments in @xmath41 samples .",
    "they observed that a fraction around 15% of the sample orders magnetically at temperatures around 200 k , while the remaining fraction of the sample orders only at temperatures below 90 k , in close connection with the strong increase in magnetization .",
    "then , a well resolved internal field appears at a lower temperature close to 77 k. another important result is that two different oscillating components were observed .",
    "this may indicate either two different muon stopping sites within the same magnetic phase or two different magnetic phases , with two different but close temperature transitions .",
    "comparing these results with ours , we find again support for the idea of phase separation , with a possible occurrence of afm clusters at temperatures between 90 and 200 k. the majority phase orders at a temperature of 77.6 k , which is close to the freezing temperature observed in our o@xmath11-annealed sample .",
    "our results have demonstrated a strong sensitivity of the magnetic properties of ru-1222 to the sample synthesis process and oxygen content , that changes dramatically from sample to sample and , for the same sample , with time . however , some common ground has been achieved .",
    "it seems clear that two different magnetic phases are present in ru-1222 : one afm phase , that shows a transition temperature around 160  200 k , and another phase that appears at temperatures around 70  90 k. the afm phase presents spin canting that leads to a small ferromagnetic loop , and it is usually a minority phase corresponding to 10  20 % of the sample volume .",
    "our results indicate that this fraction decreases with the reduction of the oxygen content .",
    "the second magnetic transition occurs at @xmath42 k when the rest of the sample starts to show some magnetic order .",
    "the frequency dependence observed in our ac susceptibility data strongly suggests that a sg phase sets in at this temperature leading to an additional ferromagnetic component . as the oxygen content",
    "is reduced and the system becomes more disordered ( or more inhomogeneous ) this sg phase is favored and both its volume fraction and freezing temperature increases .",
    "the dissipative peak observed at temperatures around 60 k ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , in the imaginary component of the ac susceptibility , seems to be related with a coercive field being close to zero in this temperature range @xcite .",
    "this fact may indicate some reordering of the spins , from the sg phase into a more ordered w - fm state .",
    "however , no significant change was observed in the magnetization curves , so if such reordering really occurs it should be quite subtle .",
    "in this work we have explored the influence of the oxygen content in the electrical and magnetic properties of polycrystalline samples of @xmath2 . it was observed that the reduction in the oxygen content favors the development of a spin glass state at the expenses of the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the presence of oxygen vacancies in the system may affect the magnetic ordering of the ru sublattice in two ways : by changing the valence of some of the _ ru _ ions and by distorting the crystalline lattice .",
    "both mechanisms introduce disorder in the system and affect the antiferromagnetic interaction , favoring the appearance of a spin glass phase . by reducing the charge density in the system",
    ", the oxygen depletion also strongly influences the resistivity and the occurrence of superconductivity in ru-1222 , which disappears completely for the n@xmath20-annealed sample .",
    "we also documented the deterioration of the samples in a time window of a few months and its recovery after annealing in a high pressure atmosphere of oxygen . in a polycrystalline sample",
    "it is expected that oxygen first leaves the grain boundaries , thus strongly affecting the resistivity of the sample .",
    "further reduction in the oxygen content occurs at the @xmath5 planes @xcite , affecting strongly the magnetic order and leading to the spin glass phase . in a later stage",
    "the oxygen from the @xmath4 planes possibly starts to leave the sample suppressing gradually the superconductivity .",
    "similarly , in the re - oxygenation process the grain boundaries are easily oxygenated , leading to a quick recover in the resistivity of the sample . however , the oxygen diffusion inside the grains is difficult and slow , being effective only when the sample is annealed in a high oxygen pressure .",
    "since this process was incomplete in our samples the spin glass phase persisted even after a high oxygen filling . by further increasing the oxygen content",
    "it starts to get into the @xmath4 planes and then superconductivity is recovered .",
    "it seems that some rearrangement of the oxygen atoms inside the sample may take place at this point , what could eventually explain why the recovery of superconductivity occurs simultaneously with an increase in the normal state resistivity as observed in this work . in conclusion , these results corroborate previous discussions on the importance of the oxygen doping level in the electrical transport and magnetic properties of ru-1222 samples @xcite .",
    "additionally , we have found that ageing effects could be a possible explanation for some of the contradictory results found in the literature for this ruthenocuprate family .",
