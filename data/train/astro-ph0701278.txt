    "` winged ' , or ` x'-shaped radio galaxies form a small and interesting subclass of extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the usual pair of ` active ' lobes , these objects possess an additional pair of lower surface brightness ` wings ' of emission , thus forming an overall winged or x - shaped appearance ( see figure  [ fig-1 ] for examples ) .    there is no clear explanation for the origin of these unusual morphologies .",
    "one possibility is that the wings result from back - flow @xcite of plasma from the `` working surfaces '' ( hot spots ) in the active lobes into an asymmetric surrounding medium , with subsequent buoyant expansion @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", it has been argued that the expansion of the wings is subsonic and it becomes difficult to explain sources with wings that are longer than the active lobes @xcite .",
    "however , this supposes that the active lobes are expanding supersonically , and into a roughly spherically symmetric medium  neither assumption may be applicable to these objects @xcite .",
    "another explanation that has received much attention lately is that the wings are the remnant left over from a rapid realignment of a central supermassive black hole / accretion disk system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps due to a relatively recent merger of a binary supermassive black - hole ( smbh ) system ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - sources are then one of only a few observational systems attributable to smbh binaries @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "a census of these sources is important to estimate the occurrence rate of mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and recurrence time - scales of ( radio - loud ) active galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one major obstacle in understanding the origin of the x - shaped radio sources as a class is that there are only a small number of known examples  17 in total from our own census of the literature ( table  [ tbl - known ] ) , though wings in radio galaxies are fairly common (   [ section - def ] ) .",
    "it is unclear whether these known ones are representative of the class as a whole .",
    "they are in the majority , identified in imaging surveys of radio samples with high flux density thresholds (   [ section - radiolum ] ) .",
    "this may explain their limited range of properties : the well - known examples are relatively local ( within z@xmath30.3 ) , and the radio luminosities straddle the fanaroff - riley ( fr ) division @xcite , with a dearth of sources showing fr - i morphology @xcite .",
    "of these , only a handful have been studied in sufficient detail to compare to the differing model expectations @xcite . until only recently (   [ section - census ] ;",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , none showed broad - emission lines characteristic of quasars ( i.e. , the population of radio galaxies aligned close to our line of sight ) , stressing the importance of source orientation in identifying new examples (   [ section - appearance ] ) .",
    "we can begin to address these issues by using larger radio imaging surveys to search for more examples of x - sources to expand the current sample for follow - up studies .",
    "we are carrying out such a project in search of new winged and x - shaped radio sources using the first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ) survey @xcite (   [ sec - id ] ) .",
    "our simple search procedure , described here , and applied to a subset of the first database , resulted so far in 100 radio sources we propose as candidates (    [ sec - id ]  and  [ sec - notes ] ) .",
    "although there are already a sufficient number of clear new examples of bona - fide x - shaped radio sources to at least double the known sample , the majority require higher resolution and better sensitivity observations to map out their morphologies more clearly ( figure  [ fig-1 ] ) .",
    "we have included sources with shorter wings ( canonically , @xmath380@xmath2 lobe length ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the hopes of disentangling projection effects .",
    "as part of the search process , we have compiled an up - to - date catalog of known x - shaped radio sources from the literature which is used to evaluate the success of our search methods (   [ section - known ] ) .",
    "a summary is given in ",
    "[ section - summary ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume a @xmath5cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath6/(100 km  s@xmath7 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "as part of our search for new examples , we compiled a list of winged and x - shaped radio sources commonly discussed in the literature ( table  [ tbl - known ] ) .",
    "fourteen well - known examples are listed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( attributed to @xcite ) .",
    "the x - shaped nature of the radio source 4c+04.40 @xcite was revealed contemporaneously to these works .",
    "@xcite recently reported 4c+01.30 as the first x - shaped source with a quasar nucleus ( i.e the population of radio galaxies with the main axis aligned closer to our line - of - sight ) , showing broad emission lines in its spectrum .",
    "one more quasar has since been identified as an x - shaped radio source @xcite , and we located two additional , more distant ( @xmath110.4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) x - shaped radio galaxies in published maps . see the appendix for notes on these five additional examples from the literature .",
    "the known examples show a range of wing to lobe length ratios ( in projection ) .",
    "this brings up the issue of nomenclature and the characteristics distinguishing an x - shaped source from a winged one .",
    "conventionally , winged radio sources with the most extended wings ( @xmath180@xmath2 of the extent of the lobes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are called x - shaped , but these are clearly phenomenologically related to shorter winged objects .",
    "the radio galaxy 4c+32.25 shows the most prominent wings , being just over a factor of two more extended than its lobes .",
    "3c  192 and 3c  379.1 have the shortest wings ( @xmath065@xmath2 of extent of lobes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) , so by convention , do not qualify as being x - shaped .",
    "however , the wings in the latter two examples may appear shortened by projection , or they may be caught in a stage of early growth or later decay ( see   [ section - appearance ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that such effects should be accommodated in further discussions of these objects as a class .",
    "the present search aims to identify new x - shaped radio sources , and winged ones are included with the points above in mind .",
    "in fact , wings are quite commonly seen in deep radio images of 3cr radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , but we will not attempt to catalog them all here .",
    "deeper observations of our candidates should determine the true extent of the wings where they may not be so apparent in the limited sensitivity first survey finder images .",
    "for these reasons , we use winged and x - shaped interchangeably throughout the rest of the text .",
    "the first survey uses the nrao very large array ( vla ) at a wavelength of 20 cm ( 1.4 ghz ) to image the radio sky with an angular resolution of @xmath05  @xcite .",
    "this relatively high resolution and the good sensitivity achieved in the survey images ( typical rms of 0.13 mjy ) has allowed investigations of new fainter samples of morphologically distinct radio sources such as , compact steep spectrum ( css ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hybrid morphology ( with fr - i and ii characteristics ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and core - dominated triples @xcite . here , we are similarly exploiting this unique database to search for new examples of x - shaped radio sources .",
    "one of the main survey products is a catalog of radio `` sources '' derived from fitting 2-dimensional gaussians ( with deconvolved major and minor axes , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and fitted peak flux ) to the images . by virtue of the high angular resolution of the survey , many of these sources are often the separate components in a single object decomposed , e.g. the lobes and/or hot spots in a double - lobed radio galaxy .",
    "most are simply unresolved point sources , or attempts by the software to fit more complicated source structures with a single gaussian when they were inadequately resolved ",
    "see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "this catalog of radio sources can be queried through the search engine on the first website ( http://sundog.stsci.edu/ ) .",
    "we ignored sources flagged by the software as sidelobes due to a nearby bright source .",
    "the latest data release ( 2003 april 11)03apr11.html[foot - first ] ] was utilized ; the sky coverage in this version of the catalog is approximately 8422 deg@xmath14 in the north galactic cap ( 7.0 hr@xmath3r.a.@xmath317.5 hr , @xmath158.0 deg@xmath3dec.@xmath3 + 57.6 deg ) , and 611 deg@xmath14 in the south galactic cap ( 21.3 hr@xmath3r.a.@xmath33.3 hr , @xmath1511.5 deg@xmath3dec.@xmath3 + 1.6 deg ) .",
    "the current first catalog contains @xmath0811,000 sources ( footnote  [ foot - first ] ) .      with the large number of images fields provided by first",
    ", our strategy is to visually examine only a well - defined subset of these :    * fields with sufficient dynamic range ( defined as the ratio of the peak : rms ) in the images to be able to see extended low surface brightness wings , and * those containing sources with resolved structure easily discernible with the @xmath05  resolution of the survey .",
    "these two issues are discussed in turn .    with a given image sensitivity",
    ", it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish the morphology of a low image peaked radio source by - eye ( below a few mjy / bm in first ) . for x - shaped sources ,",
    "the surface brightness of the wings are typically much lower than the brighter active lobes / hot spots ( the usual brightest parts of a radio galaxy ) .",
    "quantitatively , low - peaked fields of x - sources yield at most , only a few sigma detections of possible wing emission . in this work",
    ", we determined that fields with image peaks of 5 mjy / bm and greater ( @xmath040:1 dynamic range ) worked reasonably well enough (   [ section - census ] ) to see the extended emission and set this as the limit in our queries .",
    "ideally , we would have liked to inspect every field containing at least one resolved source indicating the presence of an extended lobe .",
    "this can be done by setting both @xmath12 and @xmath13@xmath15 , the resolution of the first images . however , setting this along with the @xmath15 mjy / bm image peak limit returned a large number of sources ( 8,146 ) , with a small percentage in overlapping fields whenever more than one component in the field matched the search criteria .",
    "( for reference , setting a twice fainter peak level returned approximately double the fields in our queries . ) for this initial phase of our project , we relaxed the fitted major axis to @xmath12@xmath115  which returned a much more manageable 1,648 source fields for visual inspection .",
    "we hope to address the remaining fields in future iterations .",
    "our queries returned color gif images of the 5@xmath165 arcmin@xmath14 first fields which we inspected by - eye and downloaded the fits images of the fields with hints of extended structure characteristic of wings .",
    "the fits images were then further scrutinized using the saoimage - ds9 interface to control the contrast in the images .",
    "a working list of candidates was generated for optical identifications with rough positions estimated from the radio morphologies , usually where the radio lobes intersect when a central source was not present .",
    "the final list of candidates were judged to show at least one wing roughly orthogonal to a pair of active lobes .",
    "we cross - referenced our radio - based estimated positions with ned , the digital sky survey ( dss ) based usno - b1.0 @xcite , and apm @xcite catalogues , and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the identifications were based on the position of the optical object relative to the radio source morphology .",
    "this was aided by making radio / optical overlays of the fields using the first and red - filter dss images ( figure  [ fig - new ] ) . known x - shaped sources (   [ section - known ] )",
    "were identified and removed from the candidate list .    for the objects without catalogued or visible optical counterparts ( 6 cases )",
    ", we kept the best guess radio - morphology based positions ; these are less precise because the radio emission is extended",
    ". an ( uncatalogued ) smudge appears near the radio - predicted position of j1655 + 4551 in the dss red image  we made a by - eye position measurement of this optical source .",
    "of the 100 candidates , 36 are spectroscopically identified , with half of them ( 18/36 ) found in the latest sdss data release ( dr5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is no surprise , as the first survey was designed to have overlapping coverage with the sdss .",

    "the fourth quasar ( j1430 + 5217 ) , at a more modest redshift of @xmath4=0.367 , has the clearest winged appearance among the quartet ( figure  1 ) , although curiously has a redder color ( @xmath18=1.1 ) more like the radio galaxies . the unidentified j1406 + 0657 ( @xmath18=0.0 ) and to a lesser degree , j1342 + 2547 ( @xmath18=0.4 ) ,",
    "are bluer like the highest redshift quasars ; spectroscopic observations are necessary to determine if they are quasars also .",

    ", it is apparent that they are doubles in the nvss maps and the integrated fluxes were measured by us . in the case of j13270203 , we measured the integrated 1.4 ghz flux density from the first map , rather than the nvss one , so that the 60 mjy contaminating source at the northern edge of the 2 field could be accounted for ( figure  [ fig - new ] ) .",
    "we also inspected the nvss maps to search for possible larger scale radio structure and to identify potential misidentifications ( e.g. our candidate may be part of a field source of another object ; see   [ section - census ] ) .",
    "only two objects , j1049 + 4422 and j13390016 , showed hints of diffuse emission that may be associated with our radio source ( i.e. they are not due to additional point sources in the field as seen in the higher resolution first images ) .",
    "these possible associations are difficult to determine conclusively because of the mismatch in resolution between the maps ( factor of 10 difference between nvss and first ) so this is just mentioned for completeness .",
    "a number of the txs positions were offset from our determined ones ( by @xmath191 in some cases ) .",
    "this is because of the extended ( and asymmetric ) source structure of many of these radio sources and the limited resolution of the txs measurements . in the case of the faint source",

    "[ tbl - known ] (   [ section - def ] ) , 11 have first coverage in the current data release and the efficiency in which they are recovered allow us to gauge the limitations of our search process .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows ( see table  [ tbl - known ] , column 10 ) :    * nine objects contain at least one component in the radio source satisfying our selection criteria ( @xmath15 mjy / bm peak and fwhm@xmath15 ;   [ section - search ] ) .",
    "five are readily identifiable as x - shaped sources in the first maps ( 4c+01.30 was actually originally identified as an x - shaped source from its first image ; * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining four , the largest among the known examples , were `` missed '' because of their large angular sizes . although their double lobed nature are evident in some of the first maps , their low surface brightness wing emission were resolved out . * in the two remaining cases , our peak flux and component size thresholds are set too high and we would not have inspected their first field images .",
    "the angular size of the double - lobed structure in j1357 + 4807 is small and none of its diffuse winged emission was distinguishable in the first map . in j2157 + 0037 ,",
    "its x - shaped nature is quite evident in the first map ( we identified it in a printed version in * ? ? ?",
    "however , although its eastern lobe is very bright ( 50.8 mjy / bm peak ) , its deconvolved size of 4.85@xmath163.24  is just under our threshold of 5 .    in one of the missed cases ( 4c+48.29 ) , the first image field containing its southern lobe / hot spot complex was initially selected for further scrutinization based on its double structure and surrounding diffuse emission ( figure  [ fig - j1020 ] ) .",
    "it was subsequently removed from our list because of its association with 4c+48.29 in the nvss map .",
    "all 19 objects have nvss coverage , and as realized in the 4c+48.29 case , many of these are distinguishable as x - shaped sources in the @xmath045  resolution maps while they are too large to be distinguished in the first maps ( see above ) .",
    "conversely , many of the smaller angular size ones identifiable in the first images ( e.g. , 3c  63 , 4c+01.30 , 4c+04.40 ) are unresolved in the nvss maps .",

    "however , short wings in large angular size sources ( e.g. 3c  192 , 3c  379.1 ) are not distinguishable in the low resolution nvss maps , while the first images resolve out the diffuse emission ( like in 3c  192 ) . the main limiting factor in any nvss search is that it is sensitive only to bright , prominently winged large angular size sources and the majority of these have probably already been identified",
    ". see column  11 in table  [ tbl - known ] for a summary of the first and nvss search results of the known sources .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows the 1.4 ghz radio luminosity ",

    "in fact , the four most recently identified x - shaped sources in the literature have flux densities comparable to our first candidates ( j1130 + 0058 and j2157 + 0037 were actually identified in first radio maps ) .",
    "the lower flux threshold makes it possible to identify more distant , and intrinsically lower luminosity ( at a given redshift ) radio sources as x - shaped candidates . simply by inspecting published maps",
    ", we extended the redshift limit of known x - sources from @xmath110.3 to @xmath00.4 with j1357 + 4807 @xcite and j2157 + 0037 @xcite .",
    "we can extend our census even further if we can confirm the morphologies in a number of our candidates ( four radio galaxies , j01150000 , j01430118 , j09410143 , and j13090012 at @xmath4=0.38 to 0.52 , and four quasars from @xmath4=0.37 to 0.8 ) .",
    "in such flux - limited samples , the lowest luminosity objects ( like the fr - i s ) are naturally deselected out .",
    "this makes it important to confirm if some of the less - luminous , more centrally peaked candidates ( e.g. j01440830 , j1345 + 5233 , j1600 + 2058 ) do indeed have fr - i radio morphologies ( like e.g. 3c  315 , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , these are not yet optically classified and are among the faintest and smaller angular size radio sources in our compilation .",
    "consequently , from figure  [ fig-2 ] , we see that to probe the high redshift counterparts of the lower luminosity z@xmath30.3 population ( @xmath010@xmath32 w / hz ) , we must go fainter than @xmath33100 mjy at 1.4 ghz .    for the 16 x - shaped radio _ galaxies _ with spectroscopic identifications comprising the `` literature '' sample ( table  [ tbl - known ] )",

    "beaming ( @xmath3log  @xmath34@xmath1=26.3 w / hz for the six examples ) , has little affect on the values quoted as there are but a few of these .",
    "the connection to the fanaroff - riley luminosity division is unclear although it is tempting to associate this with their transitory appearances  are these the long sought transition objects between fr - i s and fr - ii s ?",
    "however , any definitive statements would be premature as for instance , one is reminded that not all the candidates are yet confirmed x - shaped radio sources .",
    "if one were however to pursue this association further , we must explain the large range of observed luminosities of the x - shaped sources from @xmath010@xmath38 w / hz .",
    "this may find a natural explanation in the fact that the radio luminosity dividing the fanaroff - riley type - i from type - ii morphology sources is known to be dependent on the parent host galaxy magnitude over a comparable radio luminosity range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 1530@xmath2 larger for the range of redshifts considered . ] .",
    "further radio imaging of our candidates and a dedicated host - galaxy imaging program can determine the proper placement of x - shaped radio sources in the owen - ledlow plane , which may serve as a useful diagnostic of the physical origin of these peculiar objects .",
    "observationally , one expects winged / x - shaped sources to be most apparent when _ both _ the wings and active lobes are projected close to the plane of the sky .",
    "it is then no surprise that so far , the majority of them have tended toward galaxies with narrow - line systems @xcite . in unified schemes",
    "@xcite , these are the radio galaxies with active lobes projected near the plane of the sky",
    ". we must then consider the effects of projection and source evolution on their appearance for any attempt at a complete census of this class of objects .",
    "this motivated us to include candidates with shorter wings ( i.e. , wing to lobe length ratios @xmath30.8 like 3c  192 and 3c379.1 ; see   [ section - census ] ) , more amorphous looking ones , and sources with smaller angular sizes in compiling our candidate list .",
    "four of the spectroscopically identified x - shaped radio source candidates are identified as ( higher redshift ; @xmath4=0.40.8 ) quasars , adding to the two known examples ( at lower - redshifts ; table  [ tbl - known ] ) .",
    "the relatively few but increasing number of x - shaped quasars may be because their active lobes are aligned closer to our line of sight and higher dynamic range is required to detect the ( unbeamed ) low - surface brightness wings .",
    "additionally , the number density of quasars peak at @xmath1112 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so naively , we expect more x - shaped quasars to be identified as we push to high - redshifts . as an extreme case ,",
    "@xcite has recently pointed out that the @xmath4=2.065 quasar 0229 + 132 @xcite may be one of the most extreme case of an aligned x - shaped radio source with its large core - dominance .",
    "a significant population of x - shaped radio quasars may have hitherto gone unnoticed .",
    "source distance will also affect the appearance of an x - shaped radio source .",
    "for a given surface brightness ( or constant wing luminosity ) , the natural ( 1+z)@xmath39 dimming of radiation makes it more difficult to detect winged sources at high redshift .",
    "this may be why the two lower - redshift ( @xmath4@xmath30.3 ) x - shaped radio quasars from the literature @xcite have more prominent wings than our higher redshift candidates . in a flux - limited sample , the higher - redshift sources tend toward having higher luminosities ( e.g. , our quasar candidates are an order of magnitude more luminous than the two lower - redshift ones from the literature ) ; this and cosmological dimming may explain the small number of high redshift x - shaped radio galaxies and quasars identified so far ( our high-@xmath4 candidates need improved radio imaging to confirm their x - shape ) .",
    "as alluded to earlier , the extent of the wings can simply be foreshortened by projection . in the active lobes ,",
    "asymmetry / sidedness of the opposite jets serve as a proxy of source orientation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as an analogue , the pronounced asymmetry in the relative prominence between the two wings in some objects may indicate that the wings ( in the realignment scenario , this is the original source axis ) are aligned close to our line of sight .",
    "depolarization asymmetry in the wings could for example , then determine the importance of projection in the wings  this has been used as a proxy of source orientation in the lobes of classical doubles @xcite .",
    "if we can disentangle projection from intrinsic ( i.e. source evolution ) effects , the extent of the wings may indicate the evolutionary stage of the radio source . in a hydrodynamic origin ,",
    "long wings means maximal back - flow activity but short wings may either indicate the initial or terminal stages of source activity . in the realignment scenario ,",
    "the maximal extent and surface brightness of the wings occurs shortly after realignment and decreases thereafter .",
    "radio spectral mapping of the lobes and wings ( spectral index and break frequency ) can thus `` date '' the radio source @xcite to differentiate between these possibilities .    in the evolution scenario",
    ", we should be able to see a continuum of wing to lobe ratios with values so large as to create wing - dominated objects ( at the other extreme are lobe - dominated objects which are the classical doubles ) .",
    "these could masquerades as css or gps sources @xcite . as an extreme example",
    ", @xcite recently found such a gps source with a large scale structure and a inner double source with flat radio spectra ( they associate these with a pair of agn ) .",
    "another possibility is that of the `` relaxed doubles '' which have radio lobes appearing to be fading ; two classic examples ( hercules  a and 3c  310 ) have been found to have parsec - scale structures misaligned with the large - scale lobes @xcite .",
    "finally , the borderline fr - i / ii radio galaxy 3c  293 ( @xmath4=0.0452 ) was identified early on as a possible progenitor of the x - shaped sources @xcite .",
    "its inner @xmath02 kpc ( 0.88 kpc per arcsec ) double - sided source straddles a flat spectrum radio core which is coincident with the optical nucleus ; this is misaligned by @xmath030  from the @xmath0200 kpc double larger structure .",
    "@xcite noted that 3c  293 shows the `` shortest ratio of active lobe length to wing length is the only one which shows clear evidence for a recent merger '' ( cf .",
    "with more sensitive , higher resolution radio imaging of these candidates , many of them will turn out to be bona - fide x - shaped radio sources .",
    "the remaining will probably turn out to be simply winged sources , and a few are likely unrelated to the x - shaped phenomenon .    in particular , some of the objects may be `` bent - doubles , '' which have been targeted previously in a similar search through the first database @xcite . two ( j00330149 , j1111 + 4050 ) resemble narrow - angle tail ( nat ) radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> a small number of double - lobed radio galaxies ( 17 from our own census of the literature ) show an additional pair of low surface brightness ` wings ' , thus forming an overall ` x'-shaped appearance . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the wings in these radio sources is unclear </S>",
    "<S> . they may be the result of back - flowing plasma from the currently active radio lobes into an asymmetric medium surrounding the active nucleus , which would make these ideal systems in which to study thermal / non - thermal plasma interactions in extragalactic radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that the wings are the aging radio lobes left over after a ( rapid ) realignment of the central supermassive black - hole / accretion disk system due perhaps to a merger . </S>",
    "<S> generally , these models are not well tested ; with the small number of known examples , previous works focused on detailed case studies of selected sources with little attempt at a systematic study of a large sample . using the vla - first survey database , we are compiling a large sample of winged and x - shaped radio sources for such studies . as a first step toward this goal , </S>",
    "<S> an initial sample of 100 new candidate objects of this type are presented in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the search process is described , optical identifications from available literature data , and basic radio data are presented . from the limited resolution </S>",
    "<S> first images ( @xmath05 ) , we can already confidently classify a sufficient number of these objects as having the characteristic wing lengths @xmath180@xmath2 of the active lobes to more than double the number of known x - shaped radio sources </S>",
    "<S> . we have also included as candidates , radio sources with shorter wings ( @xmath380@xmath2 wing to lobe length ratios ) , or simply ` winged ' sources , as it is probable that projection effects are important . </S>",
    "<S> finally , among the candidates are four quasars ( @xmath4=0.37 to 0.84 ) , and several have morphologies suggestive of fanaroff - riley type - i ( low - power ) radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> while followup observations are necessary to confirm these identifications , this stresses the importance of source orientation and imaging limitations in finding these enigmatic objects . </S>"
