    "in the last few years a number of experiments have been performed in order to investigate the transport of electrons through small conductors , such as metallic particles and semiconductor quantum dots .",
    "@xcite one of the most commonly studied types of devices is the _ single - electron transistor _ which consists of a quantum dot ( or a small metal particle ) connected to two leads by tunnel junctions .",
    "the particle is usually also capacitively coupled to an additional gate electrode , fig .  [ system ] .",
    "the transport of electrons through the quantum dot is strongly affected by charging effects . indeed , when an electron tunnels into the dot from a lead , the electrostatic energy of the system increases by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the elementary charge , and @xmath2 is the capacitance of the dot .",
    "in a typical experiment the temperature is low , @xmath3 , and the tunneling is strongly suppressed as only a very small fraction of electrons have energy of the order of @xmath4 necessary for the tunneling to occur .",
    "this phenomenon is commonly referred to as the coulomb blockade . in a single electron transistor , the charging energy can be controlled by the gate voltage @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , by applying a positive voltage to the gate , one can lower the increase in electrostatic energy caused by adding an extra electron to the dot . as a result at certain values of @xmath5 the electrostatic gap vanishes , and the transport of electrons through the system is strongly enhanced .",
    "this leads to a sequence of periodic peaks in the conductance of the single electron transistor as a function of @xmath5 , which is often observed in the experiments .",
    "@xcite the positions and the shape of the peaks are in good agreement with the so - called sequential tunneling theory @xcite of conductance which accounts for real processes of electron tunneling between the dot and the leads .    in a number of more recent experiments",
    "the thermopower @xmath6 of a single electron transistor has been studied .",
    "@xcite similarly to the case of conductance , the thermopower shows periodic oscillations as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "the theory of the thermopower in a single electron transistor in the framework of the sequential tunneling approach was developed by beenakker and staring .",
    "@xcite it was confirmed by the experimental data of ref .",
    ", where the sawtooth shape of the thermopower oscillations predicted in ref .   was observed . on the other hand ,",
    "in a recent experiment @xcite the observed thermopower oscillations had a shape different from the sawtooth , and also the amplitude of the oscillations was far smaller than the one predicted in ref .  .",
    "the most significant difference between the experiments of ref .   and ref .",
    "was that the temperature in the latter work was very small , @xmath7 , in comparison with the estimated temperature @xmath8 in ref .  .",
    "the authors of ref .   attributed the deviation of their data from the theory @xcite to the fact that the theory neglected the effects of virtual tunneling ( _ cotunneling _ ) of electrons through the dot .",
    "indeed , it is known that in the case of very low temperatures cotunneling processes @xcite give dominant contribution to the conductance of single electron transistors .",
    "one can therefore expect that this mechanism will result in a different behavior of the thermopower at low temperatures .    in this paper",
    "we develop the theory of the thermopower of single electron transistors in the regime of inelastic cotunneling .",
    "this mechanism dominates the low temperature electron transport in the case of relatively large dots , where the effects of finite quantum level spacing can be neglected .",
    "we find the thermopower oscillations of the shape qualitatively similar to that observed in the experiment , @xcite and the amplitude of the oscillations is significantly lower than the result of the sequential tunneling theory .",
    "@xcite we also study the crossover from the cotunneling behavior of the thermopower to the sawtooth regime of sequential tunneling which occurs as one raises the temperature @xmath9 of the system above a certain crossover temperature @xmath10 .",

    "the change in the transport mechanism from sequential tunneling to cotunneling is more dramatic in the case of the thermopower . unlike the conductance",

    "we review the results for the thermopower in the sequential tunneling regime found by beenakker and staring.@xcite the sequential tunneling current is determined by the following two elementary real transition processes : ( a ) an electron tunnels between the left lead and the dot ; ( b ) an electron tunnels between the dot and the right lead .",
    "both processes are of the first order in the perturbation parameter @xmath65 .",
    "the current in the stationary state can then be derived by means of a kinetic equation which involves the probabilities for the system being in a certain charge state and the tunneling rates obtained by fermi s golden rule .    in the linear - response regime",

    "this means that the thermopower exhibits a sharp jump between two conductance peaks .",
    "if the gate voltage is tuned further towards @xmath74 , the average tunneling electron energy is given by @xmath82 and thus changes linearly with @xmath26 . using this qualitative considerations the result ( [ eq : sequential_s ] ) is reproduced except for an additional numerical factor of @xmath83 .",
    "this factor @xmath83 is due to the fact that not only electrons with energy @xmath84 above the fermi level are involved in the transport .",
    "the probability for an electron with energy @xmath85 to tunnel into the dot is proportional to the average occupation number @xmath86 in the lead and to the density of holes @xmath87 in the dot .",
