    "independent data sets , involving the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the luminosity distances of type ia supernovae @xcite , the large - scale distribution of galaxies @xcite , and cluster abundances @xcite , appear to be all consistent with a single set of cosmological parameters . in the concordance @xmath1cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm )",
    "model , the universe is flat and its expansion rate is currently accelerating ; the cosmic mass density is dominated ( @xmath2 ) by the vacuum ( the so - called cosmological constant or `` dark energy '' ) with the remaining density mostly in the form of cold dark matter ( @xmath3 ) and baryons ( @xmath4 ) .    given the emergence of a standard model in cosmology with a specific set of parameters , it is of much interest to follow the immediate consequence of these parameters in terms of the near future evolution of the @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "while several recent studies considered the qualitative implications of the accelerating universe by analytic means @xcite , it is clear that further quantitative insight can be gained only through direct numerical simulations . in (",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we simulated the evolution of nearby large - scale structure using a constrained realization of the local universe with only dark matter particles .",
    "we have found that structure will freeze within two hubble times from the present epoch , and that the dark matter halo mass function will not evolve subsequently .",
    "@xcite further studied the generic evolution of the density profile around dark matter halos embedded in an accelerating universe .    in this paper we extend previous numerical work and study the evolution of the baryonic component of the universe using a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation . in section  [ section : simulation ] we describe the simulation .",
    "images of the simulated gas mass distribution and gas temperature distribution are presented in section  [ section : visual ] .",
    "we describe the global evolution of gas temperature and overdensity in section  [ section:2d ] , and provide a more quantitative analysis based on the distribution functions of these quantities in section  [ section : dist - overd ] and [ section : dist - temp ] .",
    "the ionization fraction of cosmic gas is analyzed in section  [ section : ionizefrac ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our main conclusions in section  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "we carried out a hydrodynamic simulation with the concordance cosmological parameters ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10)=(0.3 , 0.7 , 0.04 , 0.7 , 0.9 , 1.0 ) from a redshift @xmath11 ( i.e. a scale factor @xmath12 ) through the present time ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and up to 6 hubble times into the future ( @xmath15 ; @xmath16 billion years from today ) .",
    "because the present hubble time @xmath17 gyr is very close to the current age of the universe @xmath18 gyr in the adopted cosmology , the epoch of @xmath15 roughly corresponds to @xmath19 from the big bang ( @xmath20 ) , where a subscript zero denotes present - day values .",
    "we use the updated version of the parallel tree smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget@xcite .",
    "the comoving box size of our simulation is @xmath21 , and the particle number is @xmath22 for the gas and @xmath22 for the dark matter , with corresponding particle masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( so that a group of @xmath25 particles has a total mass comparable to that of the milky way galaxy ) .",
    "we adopt the ` entropy - conserving ' formulation of sph as described by @xcite .",
    "the simulation includes a standard treatment of the radiative cooling and heating of @xcite assuming that the gas is optically thin and in ionization equilibrium ( see section  [ section : ionizefrac ] for the discussion on the validity of this assumption at late times ) .",
    "the abundance of different ionic species , including h@xmath26 , he@xmath26 , h@xmath27 , he@xmath27 , and he@xmath28 , is computed by solving the network of equilibrium equations self - consistently with a uniform ultra - violet ( uv ) background radiation of a modified @xcite spectrum and with complete reionization at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the uv background ( or , equivalently , the photoionization rate @xmath30 of the igm ) is linearly extrapolated beyond the present epoch , after which it quickly approaches zero .",
    "we have tested the validity of this assumption by carrying out another simulation with a maximum uv background field , where the value of the photoionization rate was set equal to the @xmath13 value and remained constant afterwards . even for this maximum uv background field ,",
    "the future thermal evolution of the igm remained similar .",
    "the exact behavior of the uv background field after @xmath13 is unimportant because the photoionization time - scale is rapidly increasing to values much longer than the hubble time .",
    "this follows from the fact that the cosmic volume element ( by which the ionizing photons are diluted ) grows as @xmath31 and @xmath32 grows exponentially with cosmic time , i.e. @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "the evolution of the neutral hydrogen mass density in a similar simulation run was discussed by @xcite .",
    "feedback from star formation and supernovae is formulated as in @xcite ; the underlying assumptions are also reviewed in @xcite .",
    "however , the details of the adopted star formation model should not be very important for the results presented here since the heating of the gas on large scales is dominated by the gravitationally - induced shocks .",
    "although the numerical resolution of our simulation is not adequate for following the detailed star formation history of the universe ( see * ? ?",
    "* ) , it does capture well the large - scale properties of baryons in the igm which are the focus of this work .",
    "future simulation runs with a higher resolution and an improved model of star formation and supernova feedback could address more complicate issues , such as the distribution of metals in the igm .",
    "our simulation was performed at the center for parallel astrophysical computing at harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics .",
    "shows the projected distribution of mass - weighted temperature ( left column ) and the mass surface density ( right column ) of the gas as functions of cosmic time in a slice with a comoving thickness of @xmath35 and a comoving width of @xmath21 on a side .",
    "as shown in paper i , the evolution of large - scale structure in the dark matter distribution freezes within two hubble times from the present epoch .",
    "similarly , the right column of indicates that the gas distribution does not evolve either at late times .",
    "the only noticeable change in comoving coordinates relative to the present epoch is that the filaments thin out as their mass is drained into x - ray clusters .",
    "the two visible x - ray clusters ( one at the top middle and the other at the bottom middle of this simulation ) are still connected by a low - temperature filament of gas and dark matter even at @xmath36 . in physical coordinates , these filaments rarefy considerably as the universe expands exponentially with cosmic time .    due to the adiabatic expansion of the igm , the temperature distribution of the cosmic gas evolves dramatically with time . at @xmath37 ,",
    "the high - temperature clusters ( with @xmath38  k , indicated by yellow ) are connected by filaments with a somewhat lower temperature ( @xmath39  k , indicated by red ) .",
    "as time progresses , the red filaments cool down ( @xmath40  k in green ) , get thinner , and eventually disappear into the dark background .",
    "consequently , virialized dark matter halos with gas temperature @xmath41  k are left as ` island universes ' embedded within the low - temperature igm .    in principle , it is possible for the igm to fragment into baryonic objects ( which do not necessarily overlap with dark matter halos ) due to its rapid adiabatic cooling .",
    "we have tested for this possibility by applying the hop grouping algorithm @xcite to the gas particles in the simulation , but found no evidence for such fragmentation .",
    "we caution , however , that our numerical resolution is not adequate for probing fragmentation below the mass - scale of @xmath42 .",
    "in order to demonstrate the freezing of the structure formation in the future from a different perspective , we examine the evolution of the growth factor of linear density fluctuations in a @xmath1cdm universe . shows the growth factor @xcite as a function of the logarithm of the scale factor , @xmath32 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the curve is normalized to unity at @xmath14 .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that the growth of structure ceases at about two hubble times from the present time in a universe which is dominated by a cosmological constant , consistently with the results of paper i. this saturation is caused by the exponential expansion of @xmath46 as driven by the cosmological constant .",
    "next we project the global evolution of the gas properties on the temperature  gas density ( @xmath47@xmath48 ) plane . in",
    "we show the mass - weighted distribution of baryons on the temperature  gas overdensity plane as a function of cosmic time .",
    "the time and corresponding scale factor values are indicated in each panel , and the plotted contours are equally spaced in six logarithmic intervals between the minimum and maximum values on the plane .",
    "the top left panel shows the familiar geometry of the gas distribution at the present time ; the solid line divides the gas into 3 different categories following the criteria of @xcite .",
    "as shown later , the dividing line of @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the mean density ) has a special meaning in terms of the future evolution of the igm as well .",
    "the bottom left region of the diagram corresponds to the diffuse igm which has a low density and a low temperature .",
    "most of the gas mass in this region lies on the tight nearly - adiabatic power - law relation , which can be described by analytic means @xcite .",
    "a plume - shaped region of shock - heated gas extends above the horizontal solid line at @xmath51  k. the gas with temperatures @xmath39  k is the so called _ warm - hot intergalactic medium _ ( whim ; cen & ostriker , 1999 ) , and the dense gas with @xmath52  k is the _ hot _ gas in clusters of galaxies . in the current study ,",
    "the distinction between the _ warm - hot _ and _ hot _ gas is not particularly important , and so we simply refer to them both as _ hot gas_. finally , the bottom right portion of the diagram is occupied by condensed gas that has cooled radiatively inside dark matter halos .    within two hubble times into the future ( @xmath53 ) , the innermost contour line splits into two islands , one for the low - density diffuse igm and the other for the gas in virialized dark matter halos .",
    "the overdensity of gas in dense regions increases with time because the physical density there remains nearly fixed while the background density rarefies rapidly due to its hubble expansion .",
    "the @xmath47@xmath48 diagram is stretched into a more elongated shape in the distant future .",
    "this elongation of the contour can be understood by considering the gas in clusters of galaxies that have @xmath54  k and overdensity of @xmath55 at @xmath13 .",
    "the bremsstrahlung ( which dominates the cooling rate at this temperature ) cooling time of such gas is much longer than the current hubble time : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the bremsstrahlung cooling rate per electron at a temperature @xmath47 and density @xmath48 of the cluster gas .",
    "the factor of 2 in the numerator accounts for the thermal energy of the protons in addition to that of the cooling electrons .",
    "because of this long cooling time , such gas in the outskirts of clusters of galaxies will remain hot in the distant future .",
    "the contour peak at @xmath58  k and @xmath59 corresponds to gas inside galaxies and groups of galaxies . for this gas ,",
    "the significance of metal line cooling increases with time as the gas gets enriched with supernova ejecta , and the cooling time of the enriched gas is already shorter than the hubble time at present .",
    "since our simulation does not include metal cooling and star formation is not treated accurately due to lack of numerical resolution , we can not rule out the possibility that the peak at @xmath60  k disappears at late times .",
    "after six hubble times ( @xmath36 ) , the flat bottom of the contour plot reaches the temperature floor of @xmath61  k , which is set by hand in the simulation and is not physical .",
    "the virialized gas maintains a temperature above @xmath62  k because its cooling curve drops sharply below this temperature .",
    "the vertical solid line indicates the dividing overdensity of @xmath63 .",
    "the horizontal solid line at @xmath64k will be discussed later .",
    "to describe the evolution of the igm more quantitatively , we show in the mass - weighted distribution function of the cosmic gas as a function of its density contrast @xmath65 [ panel ( a ) ] , and the cumulative mass fraction of gas with overdensity larger than a specific value @xmath66 [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "hereafter , we denote the gas mass fraction in general by @xmath67 .",
    "panel ( a ) indicates that the gas distribution becomes bimodal as time progresses ; the bottom of the valley that separates the gas into two islands is located near a density contrast @xmath68 at @xmath36 , as indicated by the vertical dotted line .",
    "this makes @xmath69 a natural choice for the borderline separating the gas into its two phases : the diffuse igm and the phase which remains bound in virialized dark matter halos ( as marked by the solid lines in ) .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that more gas shifts toward higher overdensities as it falls into the potential wells of dark matter halos at late times .",
    "this is partially because the physical density in virialized halos remains nearly the same while the background density rarefies rapidly due to the exponential expansion of the universe . from this panel ,",
    "we derive the gas mass fraction that is in the region above some overdensity value , as indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "we find that the gas mass fraction with @xmath70 is 10% ( 40% ) at @xmath37 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the gas mass fraction with @xmath71 is 22% ( 43% ) at @xmath37 ( @xmath36 ) . finally , the fraction with @xmath72 is 47% ( 58% ) at @xmath37 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "these results are summarized in , which shows the gas mass fraction @xmath73 with density contrast higher than @xmath74 ( solid ) , 200 ( short - dashed ) , and 1000 ( long - dashed line ) , as a function of cosmic time from the present epoch in units of the current hubble time .",
    "this figure shows the convergence of the amount of gas that is trapped inside virialized dark matter halos in two hubble times from the present time .",
    "the gas mass fractions with @xmath71 and @xmath75 both converge to @xmath76 at @xmath36 . at the lower threshold overdensity of @xmath77 , the mass fraction increases to 58% .",
    "the threshold value of 17.6 was derived in paper i as the critical overdensity above which mass remains bound to virialized objects at late times .",
    "shows the mass - weighted distribution function of gas as a function of the logarithm of the temperature @xmath78 [ panel ( a ) ] , and the cumulative mass fraction of gas @xmath79 with a temperature larger than a certain value [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that the minimum igm temperature decreases as a function of time due to the expansion of the universe , while the maximum temperature stays constant at @xmath80  k due to the lack of growth in the potential well depth of dark matter halos .",
    "the artificial cutoff at the temperature floor of @xmath61  k is set by hand in the simulation .",
    "panel ( b ) implies that the mass fraction of gas with @xmath81  k is roughly 60% at @xmath37 , and that this fraction decreases to 20% at @xmath36 .",
    "the mass fraction of gas with @xmath82  k is 40% at @xmath36 ( corresponding to the mass fraction above @xmath83 in ) .    shows the evolution of the maximum temperature for gas with a fixed gas mass fraction of 40% in lower density regions as a function of the logarithm of the scale factor .",
    "this quantity measures the evolution of the temperature at @xmath84 in panel ( b ) of because was a cumulative plot .",
    "indicates that the temperature of the diffuse igm cools down roughly according to the adiabatic expansion law , @xmath85 , as illustrated by the dashed line .",
    "we confirmed that the result does nt change very much even in the ` max - uv field ' run which we described in section  [ section : simulation ] .",
    "shows the mean ( mass - weighted ) temperature of all the gas in the universe , @xmath86 , as a function of the scale factor , @xmath87 .",
    "the upper horizontal axis indicates the corresponding redshift , @xmath88 .",
    "it can be seen that the beginning ( redshifts @xmath89 ) of the thermal history of the diffuse igm are dominated by the adiabatic cooling .",
    "this is also true for the end of the thermal history of the diffuse igm as we already showed in . in between these two cooling phases",
    ", there is an epoch of structure formation during which the igm is heated through large - scale shocks or the radiation emitted by stars and quasars .",
    "the value of @xmath86 at late times is dominated by the gas trapped in virialized dark matter halos which will cool only slowly with cosmic time .",
    "overall , we find that @xmath86 will peak at a value of @xmath90  k at @xmath91 , only one hubble time ( @xmath92 billion years ) from the present epoch .",
    "the appearance of the peak value of @xmath86 in the relatively near future simply reflects the lack of subsequent growth in the mass function of virialized halos .",
    "finally , we consider the ionization fraction of the cosmic gas , which we define as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the electron number density , and @xmath95 is the total number density of neutral atoms . since our simulation includes only the ionization of hydrogen and helium , @xmath96 . with this definition , @xmath97 for a fully ionized gas and @xmath98 for fully neutral gas",
    ".    shows the mass - weighted distribution of the ionization fraction as a function of the comoving gas overdensity .",
    "the contours and the gray levels are displayed on six equal logarithmic intervals in between minimum and maximum values of the projected gas mass density .",
    "the top left panel indicates that most of the gas at @xmath37 is fully ionized except for a pockets of neutral gas in star forming regions at @xmath99 . at even higher densities ( @xmath100 )",
    ", the gas is ionized again due to supernovae feedback .    the neutral fraction in star forming regions ( corresponding to the narrow contour structure extending down to the lower - right corner of each panel at @xmath101 ) continues to grow until @xmath102 , but diminishes afterwards as the neutral gas is consumed by star formation .",
    "additional infall onto virialized halos is suppressed in an exponentially expanding universe .",
    "after @xmath103 , recombination is only important in the dense cores of virialized halos , and the igm remains ionized as it continues to expand and cool .",
    "the distribution of @xmath104 in the igm does not evolve at later times .",
    "shows the mass - weighted distribution function of the gas mass as a function of its ionization fraction , i.e. @xmath105 . the lower end of the distribution gradually extends to lower @xmath104 values between @xmath37 and @xmath103 , although most of the mass is still fully ionized ( @xmath106 ) . at @xmath103 , 99% of the gas mass has an ionization fraction higher than 80% .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath104 distribution freezes outside the dense cores of virialized halos .    in our simulation , we have assumed that the gas is optically thin and in ionization equilibrium when computing the abundance of different ionic species .",
    "this assumption is of course only valid in the high density region where the collisional ionization and recombination time scales are shorter than the hubble time .",
    "we find that the ionization fraction evolve only for @xmath107 until @xmath103 . in this regime of densities ,",
    "the recombination rate is still higher than @xmath108 , and the assumption of ionization equilibrium is justified .",
    "after @xmath103 , the recombination time - scale becomes much longer than the hubble time for most of the plotted range of densities , and the distribution of ionization fraction of the igm is expected to freeze for gas that has not assembled into dark matter halos .",
    "we have simulated the future evolution of the intergalactic medium in a universe dominated by a cosmological constant , focusing on the overdensity , temperature , and ionization fraction of the cosmic gas .",
    "we have found that within a few hubble times from the present epoch , the baryons will split into two major phases : one phase of low - density , low - temperature , diffuse igm which cools adiabatically ( with @xmath109 ; see ) , and a second phase of high - density , high - temperature gas in virialized dark matter halos which cools more slowly by up to two orders of magnitude [ see equation ( [ eq : cooling ] ) ] .",
    "the mass fraction of gas which is confined in virialized dark matter halos ( defined as regions with an overdensity larger than @xmath110 ) converges to @xmath76 at late times , about twice its calculated value at the present epoch .",
    "the simulated maps of gas temperature show that the large - scale filaments disperse and merge with the low - temperature igm background after a few hubble times , and only the ` island universes ' of virialized gas maintain their physical structure .",
    "although these islands are linked by filaments of dark matter and gas in comoving coordinates , the filaments rarefy and disperse in physical coordinates due to the exponential temporal growth of the cosmic scale factor , @xmath32 .",
    "we do not find evidence for fragmentation of the baryons in the igm at later times above the mass - scale of @xmath111 .",
    "the recombination time of the expanding igm exceeds the hubble time by a factor that grows rapidly in the future , and so most of the igm gas remains ionized .",
    "after three hubble times from the present epoch , 99% of the gas mass maintains an ionization fraction above 80% .",
    "if the universe is indeed dominated by a true cosmological constant , then the diffuse igm outside virialized dark matter halos will get extremely cold but remain highly ionized .",
