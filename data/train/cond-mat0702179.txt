    "although initially disorder was considered an unwanted feature @xcite , in the light of the study of ideal systems of lower dimensionality , later it was realized that it might induce new behaviors and essentially open the way to the study of fundamental effects and to possible applications @xcite . in particular , disorder breaks the in - plane translational symmetry and can lead to a dramatic change in the physical behaviour of the interband excitations , producing multiple scattering and localization .",
    "this behaviour has several implications in the optical response of the system .",
    "in particular , it produces an inhomogeneous spectral broadening that is often used as a figure of merit of the interface quality .",
    "disorder in heterostructures and its influence on the exciton optical response have been a topic of intense research in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "in addition to inhomogeneous spectral broadening , in fact , disorder in heterostructures leads to several manifestations of fundamental quantum physics of disorder , that have been over the years one of the main motivation for these studies . in quantum wells ( qws ) in particular ,",
    "the exciton motion subject to weak disorder is an almost ideal physical realization of a particle obeying schrdinger equation in presence of a two - dimensional static disorder potential .",
    "its optical response provides direct access to the eigenstates of the exciton motion , and is an excellent mean for studying the physics of anderson localization .",
    "apart from the fundamental implications of these studies , a more practical motivation resides in the possibility of an accurate characterization of the interface structure , giving access to information complementary to that obtained by means of microscopy techniques .",
    "more recently , the influence of heterointerface disorder on exciton - polaritons in semiconductor microcavities ( mcs ) was also investigated @xcite . in this system",
    ", the fundamental excitations are the two - dimensional analog of bulk polaritons , namely normal modes of the linear coupling between excitons in a qw and the electromagnetic mode of a planar resonator @xcite .",
    "most of the existing theoretical studies have concentrated on the influence of qw disorder on polaritons @xcite , with the conclusion that polaritons are almost unaffected by qw disorder provided that the amplitude of the energy fluctuations is sufficiently smaller than the rabi energy characterizing the linear exciton - photon coupling . some experiments @xcite have recently suggested that disorder at the mc interfaces might affect the polariton quasi - particle even more than qw disorder , through its influence on the spectral properties of the resonant electromagnetic mode .",
    "in particular , unambiguous signatures of long - range defects characterizing the mc interfaces appear in the angular pattern of resonantly scattered light .",
    "these measurements even suggest that polaritons can undergo localization in the same way as excitons , however over a much larger spatial range of the order of a few @xmath0 m .",
    "there have been many theoretical studies of the influence of qw disorder on the optical response of excitons .",
    "these studies have been recently reviewed by zimmermann _",
    "@xcite in a very comprehensive manner .",
    "the influence of disorder on polaritons has received less attention in the past . in particular , theoretical studies have principally addressed the effect of qw disorder while completely overlooking the role of disorder acting on the photon component of polaritons @xcite .",
    "here , i will give an overview of the influence of disorder on excitons and polaritons in heterostructures .",
    "in the first part , i will briefly review the basic properties of qw excitons in presence of weak disorder .",
    "this review is only meant to introduce the main physical aspects that are later important in the context of mc polaritons .",

    ", i will present some original results stemming from the numerical analysis of a model that accounts both for the exciton and the photon components of disorder .",
    "this preliminary analysis clarifies the mutual roles of exciton and photon disorder , and confirms the first experimental evidence that photon disorder has the strongest influence on polaritons .",
    "it also provides a first estimate of the polariton localization length , which ranges from a few @xmath0 m to a few tens of @xmath0 m in typical samples .",
    "disorder in qws has mainly two origins .",
    "first , the height fluctuations of the qw interfaces , resulting in a variation of the qw thickness . second , alloy disorder , arising when a semiconductor alloy is used but also at an interface between two pure species ( e.g. gaas - alas ) due to segregation or interdiffusion of atoms at the interface @xcite . both effects result in an in - plane fluctuation of the electron and hole confinement energy in the qw . while alloy disorder is short - ranged",
    ", interface fluctuations can take place over a correlation length of 10 to 100 nm , especially if growth interruption is used @xcite . here , we are mainly interested in how qw disorder affects the exciton states .",
    "qw excitons display inhomogeneous spectral broadening that was shown by weisbuch _",
    "_ @xcite to be related to the thickness fluctuations resulting in a variation of the exciton confinement energy in the qw . by that time it was still unclear ,",
    "however , that disorder can affect not only the potential but also the kinetic energy of the exciton moving along the qw plane .",
    "the exciton then behaves as a massive particle subject to a disordered potential , giving rise to spatially localized eigenstates of the center of mass ( com ) .",
    "the theory of exciton states and their optical properties in disordered qws has been mainly developed over the last two decades by r. zimmermann .",
    "a complete review of this topic is found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we present a short overview of the basic elements of the theory , highlighting the aspects that are most relevant to the mc polariton problem , that is addressed in the next section .    in principle , an exciton in a disordered qw is described , within the envelope function approximation , by a two - particle schrdinger equation for the electron and the hole in three dimensions @xmath1 the confinement potentials @xmath2 describe the spatial variation of the local band edges . the @xmath3-axis is taken along the growth direction .",
    "these potentials depend on the band edge difference between barrier and well material , and contain all information on the qw disorder . in most qws of average quality , both based on iii - v and ii - vi materials , the exciton binding energy is significantly smaller than the inhomogeneous spectral broadening .",
    "this suggests that disorder has only a weak influence on the electron - hole relative motion in the exciton state .",
    "a more rigorous formulation of this idea can be given in terms of the _ rigid exciton approximation_. in practice , it is assumed that the perturbation introduced by disorder is not sufficient to produce a transition from the exciton @xmath4 state to higher states of the relative electron - hole motion .",
    "hence , the exciton stays always in the @xmath4 state and only its com motion is affected by disorder .",
    "we make the following factorization ansatz for the exciton wave function @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the com coordinate in two dimensions and @xmath7 the exciton kinetic mass . here",
    "we take @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the solutions of the schrdinger equation of an ideally flat qw structure having a confinement potential @xmath10 averaged over the in - plane coordinate .",
    "the factorized ansatz ( [ factorwf ] ) is an exact solution of the schrdinger equation with the translation - invariant potential @xmath11 .",
    "we can therefore perform a first - order perturbation theory with respect to the difference @xmath12 .",
    "this results in an effective schrdinger equation for the com wave function @xmath13 where the @xmath4 exciton energy @xmath14 of the averaged qw has been set to zero for simplicity .",

    "this result shows that the effective com potential derives from the actual energy fluctuation averaged over the relative e - h motion . due to the mass factors @xmath20",
    ", different weights are given to the electron and the hole contribution . in materials such as gaas / algaas , for example",
    ", the hole mass is larger and the well width fluctuations are averaged less efficiently , making the hole contribution dominant in ( [ vr ] ) . the validity of this rigid exciton approximation has been checked for typical qws made of iii - v semiconductors @xcite and turns out to provide an extremely good description of the exciton optical response when the inhomogeneous exciton broadening does not exceed the @xmath4 binding energy .    a microscopic model of the exciton disorder potential would require a detailed knowledge of the interface structure responsible of the confinement energy fluctuation @xmath21 .",
    "this structure depends dramatically on the growth conditions . for high quality structures made using growth interruption at both qw interfaces @xcite ,",
    "for example , interfaces are characterized by monolayer steps having size of up to 100 nm and anisotropic shape with a preferential orientation @xcite . in this case , a very detailed model for @xmath17 can be built on the basis of the experimental observations @xcite . in most situations in which growth interruption",
    "is not applied , on the other hand , the correlation length of interface fluctuations is expected to be shorter . as eq .",
    "( [ vr ] ) suggests , the short - range details of the fluctuating potential @xmath21 are smeared out in the convolution with the @xmath4 exciton wave function , which extends over a distance given by the exciton bohr radius .",
    "then , a reliable model for the effective com potential @xmath17 is given in terms of a gauss - distributed spatially - correlated random potential characterized by the correlation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the standard deviation of the gauss energy distribution and @xmath24 is a correlation function equal to 1 at @xmath25 and decaying to zero over a correlation length @xmath26 .",
    "this simple disorder model was successful in describing several features of the exciton optical response , including the level - repulsion in the statistics of energy level distances measured by near - field optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the problem of modeling the optical response of the eigenstates of eq .",
    "( [ com ] ) for the evaluation of the optical response we derive the optical matrix element for the transition between the semiconductor ground state and the exciton state ( [ factorwf ] ) .",

    "experimentally , a small angular average in the detection process is always introduced .",

    "enhanced backscattering was recently predicted and measured for excitons in very high quality qws @xcite .",
    "mc polaritons arise from the normal - mode coupling between an exciton in a qw and the lowest - frequency electromagnetic mode of a fabry - prot planar resonator in which the qw is embedded @xcite . for an ideal system without disorder ,",
    "the in - plane translational symmetry implies that the in - plane momentum @xmath62 is a good quantum number .",

    "first , it does not account for the cavity _ leaky modes _ , that can be resonant with the exciton band at finite momentum , modifying the polariton dispersion and altering the polariton radiative rate @xcite .",
    "second , the polariton non - radiative damping rates have to be modeled consistently with the steep polariton dispersion , resulting in a suppression of the damping in the strong - coupling region @xcite .",
    "the most important limitation of the coupled oscillator model , however , is its inability to model disorder effects  basically because it assumes in - plane momentum conservation that is instead lifted in presence of disorder .",
    "historically , the problem was brought up in an attempt to explain the measured inhomogeneous broadening of the mc polariton spectral lines and their dependence on exciton - cavity detuning @xcite .",
    "in particular , the coupled oscillator model ( [ poleq ] ) , only accounting for homogeneous broadening , predicts equal linewidhs for upper and lower polariton at resonance , given by the average @xmath75 .",
    "experiments instead show that , at zero detuning , the lower polariton always features a spectral line narrower than that of the upper polariton . the early theoretical models of polariton inhomogeneous broadening assumed phenomenologically an energy distribution of exciton resonances , linearly coupled to the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "this approach can explain how only a small part of the exciton spectral density concurs to the formation of polaritons , while the remaining part is weakly coupled to light and appears as a weak spectral feature at the bare exciton energy .",

    "this increase is indeed a quantum effect originating from the nonlinearity in the optical response of a two - level system and modeled by the jaynes - commings hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "_ proved that in the single - atom case instead , the vacuum - field rabi splitting was not a quantum effect and could simply be explained in terms of the classical response of a lorentz oscillator .",
    "the debate on the classical vs quantum origin of the rabi splitting was also started in connection to mc polaritons shortly after their first observation by weisbuch _",
    "@xcite , and is discussed extensively in the review by khitrova _",
    "@xcite      the effect of disorder on polaritons was first studied in connection to the interpretation of inhomogeneous polariton spectra , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "all these studies assumed that only disorder of the qw interfaces affects polaritons through their exciton component .",
    "as already pointed out , experiments brought systematic evidence of a lower polariton line narrower than the upper polariton one .    on the theoretical side , whittaker _",
    "_ @xcite were the first to study the problem in terms of in - plane propagation of the exciton subject to a disorder potential acting on its com .",
    "they suggested that _",
    "polariton motional narrowing _ could explain the small inhomogeneous broadening of the lower polariton at resonance .",
    "this conclusion however stems from the assumption that the polariton is a quasi - particle with a perfect parabolic dispersion , determined by its effective mass , at all momenta . in particular , in ref",
    "@xcite this assumption was used to evaluate the polariton linewidth from a scaling argument , that was however applied incorrectly .",

    "the correlation energy is here defined as @xmath81 in terms of the polariton effective mass @xmath82 . for typical values of the parameters of a gaas mc , vanishingly small values of @xmath79 in the range of @xmath83 mev are predicted . in reality , the description of polaritons as quasi particles with a constant effective mass is inappropriate .",
    "the lower polariton branch , in particular , recovers the curvature of the bare exciton dispersion outside the strong coupling region , as seen in fig . [",
    "fig01pol](b ) .",
    "the upper polariton , on the other hand , is resonant with exciton states at large momentum , to which elastic scattering can take place .",

    "_ was that the polariton inhomogeneous broadening is determined by the multiple scattering processes that , starting from the initial polariton states , bring to the exciton - like states at large momentum .",
    "the smaller inhomogeneous broadening of the lower polariton branch is then explained by the energy separation between the lower polariton at @xmath84 and the exciton - like states at large @xmath85 . for the upper polariton instead ,",
    "exciton - like states of the lower polariton branch exist at the same energy , thus making multiple elastic scattering more effective .",
    "this interpretation , although technically correct , somewhat hides the actual physical origin of the broadening .",
    "a more elegant interpretation was proposed by d. whittaker in two seminal papers @xcite . in simple words ,",
    "the exciton - photon scattering is assumed as momentum - conserving , while disorder acts solely in the bare exciton propagation , resulting in the inhomogeneous energy distribution of the exciton spectrum .",
    "this approximation neglects all multiple scattering terms that , starting from a photon with momentum @xmath62 , have _ intermediate photon states _ with momentum @xmath86 .",
    "the resulting green s function of the polariton in - plane motion can be written as @xmath87 where the exciton green s function @xmath88 enters as a self - energy contribution to the bare photon propagator .",
    "this equation is the most complete formulation of the linear dispersion theory .",
    "it states that a momentum - conserving polariton theory including an inhomogeneous energy distribution correctly describes the polariton spectrum , provided the microscopic model of the exciton distribution is used .",
    "the smaller inhomogeneous broadening of the lower polariton branch is then simply explained in terms of the longer high - energy tail of @xmath88 due to exciton motional narrowing .",
    "the error with respect to a full calculation is given by the polariton multiple scattering terms , that are vanishingly small as predicted by the polariton motional narrowing argument .",
    "the linear dispersion theory was carefully checked in an experiment by ell _",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath88 was independently determined by measuring the transmission spectrum of a reference qw fabricated under the same conditions as the mc sample , and applying kramers - kronig relations .",
    "as already discussed , in - plane disorder is not only responsible of a spectral broadening .",
    "the breaking of the in - plane translational symmetry still implies momentum non - conservation .",
    "experimentally , momentum scattering manifests itself in the observation of rrs .",
    "many experiments were carried out to study polariton rrs @xcite .",
    "they showed that rrs largely dominates over incoherent photoluminescence following inelastic scattering processes .",
    "the theory of polariton rrs can be developed under assuptions analogous to the linear dispersion theory , as was done by whittaker @xcite and independently by shchegrov _",
    "_ @xcite . to model rrs",
    ", they considered only the first - order scattering between two polaritons described by the propagator ( [ greenpol ] ) , occurring via scattering of the exciton component by disorder .",
    "this approximation is called the _ rrs filter model _ and assumes , in the same spirit as the linear dispersion theory , that cavity photons are subject to the least possible amount of momentum - changing scattering processes .",
    "the model describes well the experimental results qualitatively @xcite and , to a reasonably good extent , quantitatively @xcite .",
    "are the linear dispersion and rrs filter models sufficient to model all manifestations of disorder on mc polaritons ? intuitively , we expect that in mc samples with state - of - the - art interfaces  especially at large negative cavity - exciton detuning  the spectral density of the qw exciton is vanishingly small in correspondnce to the lower polariton energy .",
    "in such a case , the contribution from the linear dispersion or rrs filter models will eventually become comparable to the polariton multiple - scattering contribution to the line broadening .",
    "more generally , multiple scattering on disorder gives rise to anderson localization @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very important to investigate polariton localization and estimate the typical polariton localization length , that might be very large due to the light polariton effective mass .",
    "however occurring over a long range , localization still might play an important role in some aspects of polariton physics , such as the possibility of undergoing bose - einstein condensation , as we point out in our conclusions .",

    "_ @xcite have clearly found signatures of enhanced resonant backscattering @xcite , that can not be explained within the single - scattering picture .",
    "w. langbein @xcite has also studied the polariton localization length in a high - quality mc , by measuring the momentum spread of rrs under highly directional pulsed excitation and in the long - time limit .",
    "a lower bound to the localization length in this particular sample was set to 30 @xmath0 m .",
    "further evidence of polariton localization over the @xmath0 m scale was recently provided by gurioli _",

    "@xcite under high excitation density and spatial resolution , the polariton population buildup in the lowest energy levels allowed a direct imaging of the shape of localized eigenstates .",
    "their spatial extension was about 5 - 10 @xmath0 m , consistently with the larger disorder amplitude expected in ii - vi samples .",
    "to our knowledge , very few theoretical works studied polariton localization @xcite , and the only quantitative theoretical analysis of polariton localization was carried out by michetti _",
    "@xcite , however using a one - dimensional model and considering frenkel excitons in organic materials , thus characterized by a large disorder amplitude .",
    "their conclusion is that the polaritons are localized over 1 @xmath0 m in this particular system .",
    "another important fact that has been well established in several experimental works , concerns the role of disorder in the cavity structure , acting on the photon component .",
    "in particular , gurioli _ et al . _ @xcite were the first to remark that rrs occurs also in the case of large negative detuning of the cavity mode with respect to the exciton energy .",
    "in this situation , the exciton component of the involved polaritons is negligible and rrs can only be explained by assuming a disorder acting on the photon component .",
    "furthermore , all rrs measurements @xcite have brought evidence of a peculiar cross - shaped pattern , centered at the momentum of the excitation beam , appearing in the momentum plane in addition to the rrs ring .",
    "@xcite , and langbein _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have suggested that this is the signature of cross - hatch disorder at the interfaces of the cavity slab , originating from misfit dislocations oriented along the two orthogonal crystal axes .",
    "it is very remarkable that , despite this clear experimental evidence , all theoretical analyses of disorder effects on mc polaritons exclusively focused on excitonic disorder in the qw .",
    "below , we extend the mc polariton model to include disorder components acting both on the exciton and on the photon degrees of freedom . by computing numerical solutions of the model equations ,",
    "we review some of the main issues of polariton disorder , with special focus on the relevance of exciton and photon disorder , and briefly discuss the theoretical predictions related to the polariton rrs spectrum and localization .",
    "we present here a model that accounts both for excitonic and photonic components of disorder .",
    "before , however , some considerations on the disorder correlation length must be made . in an epitaxially grown structure",
    "we expect structural disorder on a wide range of length scales . on the shortest atomic scale ,",
    "disorder is caused by segregation of one material into the other and by alloy fluctuations in the case when a semiconductor alloy is used . on a longer length scale , typically of 10 to 100 nm , epitaxial growth causes the formation of monolayer - step fluctuations , whose lateral extension and amplitude can be only partially controlled by growth interruption @xcite . finally , the intrinsic properties of molecular beam epitaxy can produce fluctuations on a length scale above one micron @xcite .",
    "it was however shown that in qws the long and medium range interface fluctuations are almost fully correlated between the direct and the inverse interface @xcite .",
    "thus , long - range variations of the qw thickness will take place over a very long scale , practically not affecting the exciton com motion .",
    "the medium - range component , on the other hand , produces a qw thickness fluctuation only due to the different correlation lengths of the two qw interfaces @xcite .",
    "finally , the short - range component also has a contribution that is however partly averaged over the electron - hole relative wave function , as seen previously @xcite .",
    "in addition , motional narrowing reduces the influence of medium- and short - range contributions in the white noise limit @xmath46 @xcite .    in a planar mc",
    ", we can define a photon effective mass as deriving from the curvature of the photon dispersion at @xmath84 .",
    "in typical gaas - based mcs , this effective mass is as small as @xmath89 times the free electron mass .",
    "we will see below that maxwell equations for the photon motion along the plane are equivalent to an effective schrdinger equation where the photon effective mass enters the kinetic term .",
    "hence , similar considerations as for the exciton com motion apply . given the very light mass , disorder components with correlation length @xmath90 nm have @xmath91 mev .",
    "a realistic upper bound for the energy fluctuation of the photon mode is @xmath92 mev , deduced from the measured cavity - mode linewidth in modern samples .",
    "the same scaling argument used for the exciton suggests that short- and medium - range components of the mc disorder scarcely affect the in - plane motion of the photon .",
    "the long - range disorder component however is still relevant . in particular , given the large thickness of the cavity slab , the fluctuations characterizing the two interfaces are expected to be uncorrelated , differently from a qw , resulting in an overall fluctuation of the cavity thickness that will locally affect the resonant frequency of the cavity mode .",
    "since the cavity - slab thickness varies very smoothly over lengths comparable to the wavelength , we make the simplifying assumption that the electromagnetic field inside the cavity is locally equal to that of an ideally planar cavity .",
    "we introduce the further approximation of assuming a scalar electric field , thus neglecting the possible polarization vectors of the field and the corresponding selection rules for the linear coupling to the exciton spin states @xcite .",
    "the interplay between disorder and the vector nature of the polariton field was recently investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , and results in a rotation of the polarization direction of the rrs field over a timescale of a few tens of ps . within our scalar approximation ,",
    "the electric field at position @xmath93 is @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a position - dependent photon momentum along the @xmath3-direction . by neglecting terms proportional to the gradient of @xmath95 ,",
    "maxwell equations give @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the spacer dielectric constant , while @xmath98 is the excitonic macroscopic polarization field .",
    "if we consider energies close to the photon - mode energy at zero momentum @xmath99 , we can expand the @xmath100 term in ( [ maxwell2d ] ) and keep only the linear term in the expansion .",
    "the equation can now be fourier transformed to the time domain , resulting in a schrdinger - like equation for the electric field .",
    "we can expand @xmath101 to the first order in the fluctuations @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "we further define the photon effective mass @xmath104 through the kinetic term in the equation , as @xmath105 we finally obtain @xmath106 where we have defined the effective disorder potential affecting the in - plane motion of the photon @xmath107 here , we have further related the potential energy fluctuations to the cavity thickness fluctuations @xmath108 through the cavity thickness @xmath109 and the effective dbr penetration length @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the exciton macroscopic polarization @xmath111 depends linearly on the exciton center - of - mass wavefunction @xmath112 .",
    "this latter is governed by a schrdinger equation that includes the disorder potential acting on the qw exciton and the electric field as an external source @xcite .",
    "if we approximate the linear exciton - photon coupling by a constant factor @xmath113 , which holds for momentum components smaller than @xmath114 , this finally leads to two coupled schrdinger equations that we can rewrite as @xmath115 where @xmath14 is the ground exciton energy and we have introduced the damping rates @xmath116 and @xmath117 , for the photon and exciton respectively .",
    "these rates describe phenomenologically the photon escape rate from the mc and the non - radiative exciton lifetime",
    ".    equations ( [ pol1 ] ) and ( [ pol2 ] ) model the polariton dynamics in presence of disorder potentials for both the exciton and the photon fields .",
    "the vacuum - field rabi splitting is given by @xmath70 and is used as an input parameter in the calculations .",
    "the main difficulty in treating eqs .",
    "( [ pol1 ] ) and ( [ pol2 ] ) is related to the large difference in the correlation length of the disorder potentials acting on the exciton and photon components .",
    "a basic requirement for the numerical solution of a time - dependent schrdinger equation in real space , is that the size of the simulation grid step @xmath118 is small enough to correctly sample the features of the disorder potential . in more rigorous terms",
    ", the criterion is that the hopping energy @xmath119 be much larger than the two energy parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 , characterizing respectively the correlation length and amplitude of the disorder potential . in the present problem ,",
    "however , these two parameters take different values for the exciton and the photon . while the two problems are likely to be characterized by comparable values of @xmath23 , and @xmath122 , the values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 will differ considerably , due to the large difference in effective mass and correlation length . in particular",
    ", @xmath123 is much larger than @xmath124 .",
    "then , in order to correctly model the exciton kinetics , one needs to choose a value of @xmath118 reasonably smaller than 10 nm . at the same time",
    ", the simulation domain must extend over several @xmath0 m in order to model the photon propagation .",
    "this situation calls for large scale simulations with thousands of grid points for each spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "a possible way of overcoming this limitation is given by the remark that , for polaritons in the strong coupling region , the in - plane kinetics is governed essentially by the photon effective mass .",
    "hence , taking the limit @xmath125 should leave the results in the strong coupling region unchanged , while affecting the predictivity of the model in the exciton - like part of the lower polariton branch .",
    "we call this approximation _ local oscillator model _ , as the exciton part of the dynamics is now described by a set of independent local oscillators at each simulation site . in the absence of photon disorder ,",
    "the validity of this approximation was suggested by whittaker @xcite , who showed that the influence of exciton disorder on the polaritons in the strong coupling region is to all extents negligible , already in the case @xmath126 .    in order to test the local oscillator model also in presence of photon disorder ,",
    "we have carried out large - scale numerical simulations of the polariton spectrum , comparing the local - oscillator and full kinetic results .",

    "disorder potentials were assumed gauss - correlated in space , with @xmath129 mev , @xmath49 nm , @xmath130 mev , and @xmath131 m , corresponding to currently available good quality systems . the rabi splitting was @xmath132 mev , as for a typical sample embedding a single gaas qw , while zero exciton - cavity detuning was assumed .",
    "equations ( [ pol1 ] ) and ( [ pol2 ] ) were solved using the kernel - polynomial method @xcite .",
    "this method gives direct access to the spectrally resolved green s function .",
    "with respect to time - evolution methods @xcite it has the advantage of a rapid convergence , as the relative energy resolution scales as @xmath133 with the number @xmath134 of momenta in the polynomial expansion , at the boundary of the @xmath135-wide tight - binding spectral domain .",
    "we needed @xmath136 to reach an energy resolution better than the typical polariton homogeneous broadening of about @xmath137ev .",
    "as each momentum requires one application of the linear operator defined by the right - hand side of ( [ pol1])-([pol2 ] ) , this number should be compared to the number of time - steps in a time - evolution simulation which is typically of a few millions for the same energy resolution . as initial state , we assumed an excitation pulse of 1 @xmath0 m gauss - width .",
    "the simulation gives access to the polariton spectral function , defined as the fourier - transformed electric field as @xmath138 .",

    "although the log - scale plot does not provide a clear quantitative information , still two important features can be guessed .",

    "the numerical approach that we use does not give direct access to the polariton wave functions , but we can guess that in this disorder realization at least one well localized state of both upper and lower polariton exist .",
    "the localization length can be inferred from the extension on the momentum axis and amounts to a few @xmath0 m .",
    "the second important feature to be noticed is the rather sharp spectrum of the lower branch at large momentum , where the polariton is almost fully exciton - like . here ,",

    "[ fig04pol ] ( a ) and ( b ) the polariton spectrum taken at @xmath84 and @xmath144 respectively . in each plot ,",
    "four curves are compared , corresponding ( i ) to the full simulation , ( ii ) to setting @xmath141 and @xmath130 mev , ( iii ) to setting @xmath129 mev and @xmath142 , and ( iv ) to the local oscillator limit in which both disorder amplitudes are nonzero . at @xmath84 , the spectrum obtained by setting @xmath141 matches very well to the full simulation . in particular , both the linewidths and the relative intensity of upper and lower polaritons",
    "are well reproduced .",
    "we notice a small energy shift due to the overall exciton localization energy and some speckles that are not present in the curve with @xmath141 .",
    "this first comparison suggests that exciton disorder does affect the polariton spectrum , but only marginally , whereas the main spectral features are essentially determined by photon disorder .",
    "indeed , the spectrum obtained by setting @xmath142 differs more significantly from the full simulation .",
    "it underestimates in particular the upper polariton linewidth while largely overestimating its peak intensity .",
    "finally , we notice that the local oscillator limit reproduces fairly well the full result .",
    "again , the upper polariton strength is overestimated , although less dramatically than in the spectrum with @xmath142 .",

    "contrarily to the previous case , the spectrum with @xmath141 differs significantly from the full simulation , which is instead almost exactly reproduced by the simulation with @xmath142 .",
    "this difference is expected , as in this region photon and exciton modes are practically uncoupled . in particular , the lower branch is almost fully exciton - like and disorder on the exciton component plays a major role .",
    "finally , we point out that the local - oscillator limit in fig .",
    "[ fig04pol ] ( b ) completely misses the sharp features in the spectral region of the lower polariton .",
    "the reason is again clear , as in this region the exciton motional narrowing due to its finite mass is effective in determining the spectral features . in conclusion ,",
    "the comparison between the four different cases gives two important indications .",
    "first , in the strong - coupling region the main spectral features are determined almost exclusively by the disorder acting on the photon component , whereas both disorder components become important in the regions where exciton and photon modes are decoupled .",
    "second , the local oscillator limit is a very good approximation in the strong coupling region , where exciton motional narrowing does not affect the polariton spectrum @xcite .     for a single exciton disorder realization , with @xmath142 and @xmath23 taking the values indicated in the plot.,width=384 ]    to conclude this section , we take advantage of the simulations to study how the exciton disorder affects the polariton spectrum for increasing disorder amplitude . in fig .",
    "[ fig05pol ] , we display polariton spectra computed at @xmath84 for increasing values of the exciton disorder amplitude @xmath23 , while keeping @xmath142 .",
    "the polariton linewidth is practically unaffected by exciton disorder for @xmath147 mev .",
    "in particular , the lower polariton branch proves to be more robust than the upper one to inhomogeneous broadening . starting from @xmath148 mev",
    ", both polariton peaks display a considerable inhomogeneous broadening of the same order as @xmath23 .",
    "eventually , polariton localization becomes the dominant mechanism and the rabi splitting is completely washed out for @xmath149 mev .",
    "the behaviour observed in this numerical simulation essentially confirms the result that were obtained by d. whittaker @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of that work was that the polariton inhomogeneous broadening originates almost only from multiple scattering to more or less localized exciton states weakly coupled to the photon mode . for small disorder , these states have a vanishing spectral density at the energy of the lower polariton branch , thus explaining the robustness of this line to inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "multiple scattering of polaritons within the strong coupling region contributes only negligibly , due to the very short spatial range of the qw disorder , thus also preventing polariton localization . here",
    ", by considering an additional source of disorder acting on the photon component , we might generalize this statement as follows .",
    "_ polariton multiple scattering within the strong coupling region  and consequent polariton localization  are exclusively due to scattering by the long - range disorder acting on the photon component , provided the amplitude of exciton disorder is significantly smaller than the vacuum - field rabi splitting_. consistently , the inhomogeneous broadening of the lower polariton line is mostly due to photon disorder .      in the previous section ,",
    "we have checked the validity of the local oscillator approximation .",
    "we can now take advantage of this approximation for performing numerical simulations of large spatial domains .",
    "for the numerical simulations , we remind that the step @xmath118 of the simulation grid must be chosen in such a way that the hopping energy @xmath119 is much larger than any other characteristic energy of the system .",
    "contrarily to the full simulation , now we are only limited by the very small photon effective mass @xmath82 , which results in very large values of @xmath150 . this makes it possible to use much larger values of the grid step , therefore giving access to simulations over a very large spatial domain .    as an example",

    "( a ) , the spectral broadening of both lower and upper polariton in the strong coupling region is however significantly larger than in panel ( b ) , as a result of the photon disorder .",

    "[ fig06pol ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we also notice that the first spectrum is rigidly shifted to slightly lower energy with respect to the second one .",

    "as already pointed out in the previous section , both are clear signatures of polariton spatial localization due to the long - range photon disorder .",
    "in particular , the flat features in the energy - momentum rrs plots correspond to discrete polariton eigenstates that are localized via their photon component .",

    ", we can estimate the localization length from the momentum spread of the rrs spectral pattern . in the case with nonzero photon disorder amplitude ,",

    "the case with only exciton disorder , on the other hand , gives 50 @xmath0 m as a strict lower bound for the polariton localization length at the band bottom .",
    "we have presented an overview of the research on disorder effects on excitons in qws and polaritons in mcs . as a general rule , the most direct consequences of disorder are the inhomogeneous spectral broadening and the rrs in the optical response .",
    "microscopically , disorder in two dimensions is expected to give rise to spatial localization of the com motion . in the case of qw excitons ,",
    "com localization was the object of a careful analysis , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "the effect of disorder on polaritons , on the other hand , awaits a more detailed anaysis .",
    "the existing studies have mainly focused on the effect of qw disorder .",
    "the effect of disorder in the dielectric structure of the mc was pointed out by some recent experimental studies but never investigated in detail . moreover , due to the very light effective mass of the polariton quasi - particle at the bottom of the polariton dispersion , the idea that localized states of polaritons might arise was overlooked by most studies .    in the second part of this work ,",
    "we have presented an original study of disorder on polaritons , based on a model that accounts for qw and mc disorder components on equal footing .",
    "preliminary numerical results suggest that polaritons are mostly affected by the long - range photon component of disorder , which is responsible for rrs and polariton localization .",
    "the localization length of polaritons , predicted for typical parameters of today s semiconductor heterostructures , ranges from a few @xmath0 m to a few tens of @xmath0 m at the bottom of the polariton band , in agreement with the few existing experimental studies .",
    "localization is very important in view of the recent experiments aimed at achieving bose - einstein condensation of qw excitons @xcite or mc polaritons @xcite in two - dimensional systems . in a bose gas in two dimensions , conventional bose - einstein condensation with occurrence of off - diagonal long - range order can not take place , as stated by the hohenberg - mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "theory instead predicts the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite from a disordered phase with spontaneous formation of vortices , to an ordered phase called quasi - condensate , characterized by a bogolubov spectrum of collective excitations and a polynomial decay of long - range spatial correlations @xcite .",
    "if however the bose gas is trapped @xcite or subject to disorder @xcite , then a genuine bose - einstein condensate can be expected , provided the localization occurs over a sufficiently small scale . with increasing size of the condensate , on the other hand , a crossover from genuine bose - einstein condensation to a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless behaviour should take place .",
    "a thorough characterization of exciton and polariton localization and of its influence on the phase transition is then a necessary step for understanding the nature of these collective phenomena .",
