    "the goal of this work is to extend the analysis inward toward the galaxy nucleus , using a combination of hst and ground based imaging to obtain surface brightness profiles ranging from @xmath120 pc to a few kpc .",
    "we perform psf - convolved sersic + exponential fits and describe the behaviour of the profiles in the inner few hundred parsec .",
    "we work with 19 galaxies extracted from the balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) sample of inclined disk galaxies . for these galaxies , we have obtained hst / wfpc2 and hst / nicmos images . other analysis of this sample may be found in peletier & balcells ( 1996 ) , peletier et al .",

    "we analyze the hst / nicmos f160w nic2 images ( 19@xmath919  , 0.075 `` /pixel ) with galphot ( jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1992 ) and extract elliptically - averaged surface brightness profiles .",
    "these are converted to @xmath10 band magnitudes .",
    "we then use the elliptically - averaged @xmath0-band surface brightness profiles derived from ukirt / nicmos3 images ( 75''@xmath975  , 0.291/pixel ) published by peletier & balcells ( 1997 ) , which we transform to @xmath10 band using the relation @xmath11 ( leitherer et al .",

    "the distribution of shape indices @xmath6 vs morphological type t is shown in figure  [ mb2:fig : sersic]c . albeit with poor statistics , we reproduce the well - known result that shape indices @xmath6 reach higher values in early - type galaxies ( andredakis et al . 1995 ; graham 2001 ) .",
    "intermediate - type galaxies have @xmath14 , ie .",
    "the bulges of these galaxies do not follow the de vaucouleurs law .",
    "these values of @xmath6 are systematically higher than those obtained from the fits to the ground - based data alone .",
    "why is that ? because the bulge light profiles , when seen with hst spatial resolution , show central light excesses which force the sersic fit to a higher @xmath6 .",
    "the fits show deviations in the outer parts .",
    "we show the prevalence of excesses with respect to the sersic profile by plotting residuals with respect to the fits performed over a radial range that excludes the central 0.5 \" ( fig .",

    "21 @xmath15 9% show central depressions .",
    "21% follow the sersic profile over the entire radial range .",
    "the presence of light excess does not correlate with morphological type in the present data set .",
    "we conclude that the sersic law can not provide a full description of the surface brightness profiles of bulges from @xmath120pc out to a few kpc .",
    "other functional forms are required .",
    "we have investigated nuker profiles ( faber et al .",

    "we obtain values that scatter around @xmath19 .",
    "only one in 19 profiles has a flat - profile `` core '' , given by a low @xmath20 . the observed range is comparable to that obtained for intermediate luminosity ellipticals and lenticulars by nuker fits to hst data ( faber et al . 1997 ) .",

    ". the value of @xmath17 does not correlate with morphological type for the present sample .",
