    "over the last two decades scientific activities in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics have discovered universal relations regarded as extensions of the second law of thermodynamics . examples of such universal relations include fluctuation theorems that claim identities leading to the positivity of entropy production in non - equilibrium steady states ( ness ) @xcite , jarzynski s work relations by which free energy differences are estimated in non - equilibrium processes @xcite , and steady state thermodynamics ( sst ) in which state variables are defined by ( excess ) heat or works in ness @xcite .",
    "recently , for over - damped systems near equilibrium , sivak and crooks presented a work relation associated with a generalized free energy for a time - dependent state realized by a finite - speed operation to an equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "the free energy they defined is expressed as the relative entropy of the probability density with respect to an equilibrium state realized after sufficient relaxation @xcite .",
    "remarkably , when the quasi - static limit is considered , a variation of the sivak and crooks relation ( see ) becomes equivalent to a thermodynamic relation between work and the difference in equilibrium free energies .",
    "this means that the sivak and crooks relation is an extension of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "a natural question arising here is whether the sivak and crooks relation is connected to previously known relations , such as fluctuation theorems , jarzynski s work relations , or formulas proposed in sst .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find a direct connection to previous studies by presenting a simpler derivation of the sivak and crooks relation .",
    "our re - derivation clearly demonstrates that the sivak and crooks relation corresponds to a non - stationary version of the extended clausius relation proposed in sst @xcite .",
    "following the idea proposed in sst , we successfully generalize the sivak and crooks relation to be valid for systems with momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "we study systems consisting of @xmath0 particles under isothermal environment of inverse temperature @xmath1 . examples of such systems include ( i ) a hamiltonian system in contact with a heat bath , ( ii ) an under - damped langevin equation , or ( iii ) an over - damped langevin equation .",
    "the microscopic coordinates of @xmath0 particles are collectively denoted by @xmath2 for hamiltonian systems and under - damped langevin equations or @xmath3 for over - damped langevin equations .",
    "for all the considered cases , a hamiltonian @xmath4 characterizes the system , where @xmath5 represents a set of parameters . for simplicity , we assume @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the time - reversal of @xmath8 defined as @xmath9 .",

    "note that the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath31 is not written explicitly , but the @xmath20 dependence is shown .",
    "for the reversed protocol @xmath21 , we express the probability density of @xmath26 as @xmath32 .",
    "the important assumption of our model is that @xmath28 satisfies the local detailed balance condition @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the energy that flows from the heat bath to the system in the path @xmath23}$ ] for the protocol @xmath11 .",

    "the boltzmann constant is set to be unity .",
    "when the parameter value is fixed as @xmath5 ( that is , @xmath35 is independent of @xmath36 ) , the probability density converges to the canonical one @xmath37 in the limit @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the free energy defined by @xmath40 now , we fix a functional form of the scaled protocol @xmath41 @xmath42 and assume that the system is in equilibrium at @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be the probability density of the time - dependent state at the end of the protocol @xmath11 with @xmath46 .",
    "formally , in terms of the path probability measure @xmath47 , we express @xmath48 as @xmath49 we shall characterize this probability density .",
    "let us suppose that the value of @xmath5 in the system is fixed as @xmath50 after finishing the protocol @xmath11 .",
    "the system relaxes from the time - dependent state @xmath51 , and the probability density approaches the canonical one @xmath52 .",
    "we then measure the distance of @xmath51 from @xmath52 by the relative entropy @xmath53 , whose definition is given as @xmath54 for any two probability densities @xmath55 and @xmath56 . the relative entropy has been a useful quantity in the characterization of the dissipation @xcite as well as in information science @xcite . in particular , it should be noted that @xmath53 is connected to a generalized free energy @xmath57 defined as @xmath58 with @xmath59 the calligraphic font used in @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 represents their functional dependence of @xmath51 .",

    "the work @xmath83 in @xmath11 and @xmath84 in @xmath21 are measured . ]",
    "by using the energy conservation @xmath85 we rewrite the local detailed balance condition as @xmath86 e^{-\\beta\\frac{{w_\\mathrm{irr}}({\\hat{\\gamma}})}{2 } } = { \\rho^\\mathrm{can}}_{{\\nu_1}}(\\gamma^*({\\tau } ) ) { \\mathcal{t}}_{\\epsilon}^\\dagger[{\\hat{\\gamma}^\\dagger } ] e^{-\\beta\\frac{{w_\\mathrm{irr}^{\\dagger}}({\\hat{\\gamma}^\\dagger})}{2 } } , \\label{e : symmetry2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "integrating over all paths , we have a symmetric jarzynski - type equality @xmath90 furthermore , by integrating over paths @xmath26 that satisfy the condition @xmath91 , we obtain the following expression for @xmath51 : @xmath92 the relations ( [ e : jarzynski ] ) and ( [ e : knlike ] ) are basic equations in our derivation .    to expand the relations ( [ e : jarzynski ] ) and ( [ e : knlike ] ) in terms of @xmath20 , we prepare the following three estimations .",

    "is further rewritten as @xmath106 by combining this expression with and , we can derive the following relation for the entropy : @xmath107 this is an extended clausius relation , because ( [ e : sre ] ) leads to the standard equilibrium clausius relation @xmath108 in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "similarly , leads to the standard equilibrium work relation in the limit @xmath110 .",
    "let us compare ( [ e : sre ] ) with the extended clausius relation in sst , where it has been shown that heat measurement enables us to experimentally determine state variables for non - equilibrium steady states driven by a non - conservative force or by non - equilibrium boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it is found that ( [ e : sre ] ) takes the same form as an expression reported in ref .",
    "( see eq .",
    "( 11 ) of ref .",
    "this is not accidental .",
    "in fact , the derivation method of ( [ e : sre ] ) or ( [ e : re4 ] ) is essentially the same as that used in ref .",
    "furthermore , the sivak and crooks relations can be easily formulated for time - dependent states generated by an external operation to ness . from these considerations , in our viewpoint , ( [ e :",

    "next , we consider under - damped systems ( @xmath111 ) .",

    "@xcite , the symmetric shannon entropy was proposed as a new state variable determined operationally by measuring the excess heat in the quasi - static operation connecting two ness near equilibrium .",
    "explicitly , the symmetric free energy @xmath117 is written as @xmath118 the right - hand side is not the relative entropy .",
    "rather , it can be called `` symmetric relative entropy . ''",

    "now , we present the inequality @xmath140 for any @xmath141 . the essence of the proof is to notice the monotonically decreasing property of the relative entropy in relaxation processes @xcite , that is , @xmath142 for any @xmath141 . in order to utilize this property",

    "furthermore , we point out that @xmath145 ( or @xmath146 for underdamped cases ) corresponds to the concept of the free energy for partially equilibrated states when @xmath132 is much larger than local equilibration time scales but much shorter than a global equilibration time . since partially",
    "equilibrated states are often observed in several complex systems such as proteins , the present scheme might be useful for experimental determination of the free energy of such states @xcite .    in sum",
