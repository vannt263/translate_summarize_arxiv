    "these reflections are detected by the transducer array in a reception phase , where a second beamforming process is applied , aimed at localizing the scattering structures while improving signal to noise ratio ( snr )  @xcite .",
    "the reception beamforming process involves averaging the detected signals , after aligning them with time - varying delays .",

    "was proposed in  @xcite , where the signals detected in each element were assumed to satisfy the fri property  @xcite . applying the fri framework ,  @xcite derive schemes , which allow reconstruction of ultrasound signals from samples taken at sub - nyquist rates .",
    "these approaches follow the spirit of xampling  @xcite , a term which refers to the combination of classical sampling theory with recent developments in compressed sensing ( cs )",
    ". however , applying such schemes to data reflected from biological tissues , the resulting signal parameters are often erroneous .",
    "this is mainly due to the noisy nature of multiple reflections , also known as  speckles \"  @xcite , which are scattered by microscopic perturbations in the tissue .    in order to cope with the noisy nature of the signals detected in individual elements ,  @xcite",
    "first introduces a multi - sensor xampling scheme , which enhances the snr of the low - rate samples .",
    "this is achieved , by integrating traditional beamforming with fri xampling .",
    "the approach proposed in  @xcite is farther developed in  @xcite , resulting in a more straightforward sampling mechanism . both approaches , referred to by the term  compressed beamforming \" ,",
    "are derived and simulated for the special case of linear , b - mode scan .    in the current work ,",
    "we generalize the method introduced in  @xcite to the case of polar scan . additionally , we propose reconstructing the sampled signal by applying cs techniques , rather than spectral analysis methods , traditionally used in the fri framework  @xcite .",
    "finally , we apply our approach to real cardiac ultrasound data , where we successfully image macroscopic perturbations , while achieving a nearly eight - fold reduction in sampling rate , compared to standard imaging techniques .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:02 ] , we outline the principles of beamforming in ultrasound imaging . in section [ sec:03 ]",
    "we discuss the fri model in the context of ultrasound imaging , and its contribution to rate reduction when sampling signals at individual receivers .",
    "our multiple - receiver xampling scheme , which integrates beamforming into the xampling process , is presented in section [ sec:04 ] . in section [ sec:05 ]",
    "we introduce experimental results , obtained for cardiac ultrasound data .",
    "we begin by outlining the beamforming process , lying at the heart of ultrasound imaging .",
    "the process is carried out both in transmission and reception . during transmission ,",
    "modulated pulses are transmitted from all active array elements . applying appropriate delays to the transmitting elements",
    ", the propagating energy may be directed along a narrow beam , in any desired direction , the result of a constructive and destructive interference pattern .",
    "the acoustic reciprocity theorem allows to perform a similar process during reception . in this case",
    ", we regard the perturbations , which reflect the transmitted energy , as point transmitters . applying appropriate delays to the detected signals",
    ", the array may be focused to any coordinate , such that if , indeed , energy was scattered from that point , then the combined signals will undergo constructive interference . knowing that most energy propagates along a narrow beam , and knowing its propagation velocity , we may associate time instances to radiated points in the medium , thus optimizing the reception focal point at these instances .",
    "the resulting process , in which time - varying delays are applied to the detected signals , prior to combining them for snr enhancement , is referred to as  dynamic focusing \" .    in order to derive an explicit expression for dynamic focusing , consider an array of @xmath0 receivers , aligned along the @xmath1 axis .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the distance from the @xmath3th receiver to the origin .",
    "assume a pulse of energy , transmitted at @xmath4 from the origin , at direction @xmath5 .",
    "the setup is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] . at time @xmath6",
    ", the pulse , propagating at velocity @xmath7 , crosses @xmath8 .",
    "a reflection originating from this coordinate will reach the @xmath3th element at time : @xmath9 with @xmath10 . denoting by @xmath11 the index of a reference receiver ,",
    "satisfying @xmath12 , it is readily seen that @xmath13 .",
    "hence , in order to align the reflection detected in the @xmath3th receiver with the one detected in the reference receiver , we need to apply a delay to the detected signal , @xmath14 , such that the resulting signal , @xmath15 , satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "this implies a time - varying time delay , applied to @xmath14 , resulting in the following distorted signal : @xmath17 the aligned signals may be combined into the beamformed signal @xmath18 which exhibits enhanced snr compared to @xmath19 .",
    "although defined over continuous time , ultrasound systems perform the process formulated in - in the digital domain , requiring that the analog signals @xmath20 first be sampled . confined to classic nyquist - shannon sampling theorem , these systems sample the signals at twice their baseband bandwidth , in order to avoid aliasing .",
    "the detected signals typically occupy only a portion of their baseband bandwidth . exploiting this fact , some state of the art systems manage to reduce the amount of samples transmitted from the front - end , by down - sampling the data , after demodulation and low - pass filtering .",
    "however , since such operations are carried out digitally , the preliminary sampling - rate remains unchanged .",
    "our goal is to produce an ultrasound image from samples taken far below the nyquist rate . a first step in this direction",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where the signals detected in each element were assumed to satisfy the fri property .",
    "more specifically , they were approximated as @xmath21 replicas of a known - shape pulse , @xmath22 , caused by scattering of the transmitted pulse from @xmath21 reflectors , located along the narrow transmission beam .",
    "explicitly , the signal detected in the @xmath3th receiver was modeled as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the time , in which the reflection , originating from the @xmath25th reflector , arrives at the @xmath3th receiver , and @xmath26 denotes the reflection amplitude .",
    "hence , the detected signal is completely defined by @xmath27 parameters , @xmath28 . as shown in @xcite , spectral analysis techniques ( e.g. annihilating filter  @xcite )",
    "may be applied , in order to extract the signal parameters , from its projection onto a @xmath27-dimensional subspace , corresponding to its fourier series coefficients .",
    "the sampling scheme is thus reduced to the problem of extracting @xmath29 frequency samples of the detected signal , where @xmath30 .",
    "denote the temporal support of the detected signal , @xmath14 , by @xmath31 .",
    "imaging to a nominal depth of @xmath32 , @xmath33 is approximately @xmath34 .",
    "the signal s baseband bandwidth requires a nominal sampling rate of @xmath35 , resulting in an overall number of @xmath36 real - valued samples . still within classical sampling framework , assuming that the signal s passband bandwidth is only @xmath37 , the data sampled at nyquist rate may be down - sampled to 1680 real - valued samples .",
    "thus , as long as the number of reflected pulses satisfies @xmath38 , substantial rate reduction may be achieved by an fri xampling scheme .",
    "the scheme proposed in @xcite enables sub - nyquist sampling of the signal detected in an individual array element .",
    "sampling signals reflected from phantom targets , it managed to achieve good signal reconstruction . however , when applied to data reflected from biological tissues , the resulting signal parameters are often erroneous .",
    "this is mainly the result of multiple reflections , scattered from microscopic perturbations , manifested as noise . in extreme scenarios , where the noise masks the fri component ,",
    "the extracted parameters will be meaningless , such that any attempt to cope with errors in the parametric space will turn out useless .",
    "the novelty of our approach regards the assumption , that the fri scheme applied to an individual element may be equally applied to the beamformed signal defined in , which obviously exhibits much better snr .",
    "indeed , it may be shown that , if the signals @xmath20 obey the fri model , then @xmath39 is * approximately * of the form : @xmath40 and may thus be regarded as fri . the parameters @xmath41 in depend on @xmath5 , yet we omit this dependency from our notation , for convenience .",
    "an obvious problem is that , as stated in section [ sec:02 ] , the signal @xmath39 does not exist in the analog domain . in the next section ,",
    "we derive our scheme , which manages to estimate its necessary low - rate samples from low - rate samples of filtered versions of @xmath20 .",
    "the fri xampling scheme applies spectral analysis techniques , in order to estimate the @xmath27 unknown signal parameters , from a subset of its consecutive fourier coefficients . denoting the cardinality of this subset by @xmath29",
    ", perfect reconstruction requires that @xmath30 .",
    "denote by @xmath42 the set of indices @xmath43 , corresponding to the selected fourier coefficients .",
    "having obtained these coefficients , other mechanisms may be applied , in order to reconstruct the signal . in our work , for instance , we use cs methodology .",
    "since each of the signals @xmath20 is supported on @xmath31 , then , by - , @xmath39 may only be constructed on a support contained in @xmath31 .",
    "considering its fourier series , calculated with respect to this interval , let us explicitly write the @xmath44th fourier coefficient , @xmath45 .",
    "we will additionally assume , that the time delays , @xmath46 , are quantized with @xmath47 quantization step , such that @xmath48 , @xmath49 : @xmath50 here @xmath51 denotes the ctft of @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the ratio @xmath53 .",
    "then may be brought into the following matrix form : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath56 diagonal matrix with @xmath57 as its @xmath58th element , and @xmath59 is a length @xmath52 vector , whose @xmath58th element equals @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 otherwise . finally , @xmath63 is a @xmath64 matrix , formed by taking the set @xmath42 of rows from a @xmath65 fft matrix . assuming that @xmath66 , this is a cs problem , aimed at estimating the @xmath21-sparse vector @xmath59 from @xmath29 samples , taken with a measurement matrix @xmath67 .",
    "a common technique for recovering @xmath68 is the orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) algorithm , which we use in our work .",
    "we now return to the problem of obtaining the set @xmath42 of @xmath39 s fourier coefficients .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the @xmath58th fourier coefficient of @xmath39 .",
    "then , @xmath69 where , from : @xmath70 applying a change of variable to the integral , we can write as @xmath71 with @xmath72 here @xmath73 denotes an indicator function having the value 1 for @xmath74 and 0 otherwise , and @xmath75 is the maximal time value which is mapped , under the temporal distortion defined in , to the support of the beamformed signal .",
    "the process defined in - can be translated into a multi - channel xampling scheme , in which each signal , @xmath14 , is multiplied by a bank of kernels @xmath76 defined by , and integrated over @xmath77 .",
    "this results in a vector @xmath78^t$ ] .",
    "the vectors @xmath79 are then averaged in @xmath80^t$ ] , which has the desired improved snr property , and provides a basis for extracting the @xmath27 parameters which define @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , the complexity of the analog kernels , together with their dependency on @xmath5 , makes hardware implementation of such a scheme extremely complicated .",
    "we thereby take an additional step , approximating the samples @xmath81 from low - rate samples of @xmath14 , taken in a much more straightforward manner .",
    "first , we substitute @xmath14 of by its fourier series , calculated with respect to @xmath31 . denoting the @xmath82th fourier coefficient by @xmath83",
    "$ ] , we get : @xmath84\\frac{1}{t}\\int_0^t{q_{j , m}(t;\\theta)e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{t}\\left(k_j - n\\right ) t}dt}}\\\\ & = \\sum_{n}{\\phi_m\\left[k_j - n\\right]q_{j , m;\\theta}\\left[n\\right ] } , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 $ ] are the fourier series coefficients of @xmath86 , also defined on @xmath77 . replacing the infinite summation of by its finite approximation : @xmath87q_{j , m;\\theta}\\left[n\\right ] } , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "it can be shown that , for any @xmath88 , and for any selection @xmath89 , there exist @xmath90 and @xmath91 such that @xmath92 . therefore , with the finite sum , we may approximate @xmath93 to any accuracy .",
    "furthermore , setting an upper bound on the energy of @xmath14 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 may be chosen off - line , subject to the decay properties of the sequence @xmath96\\right\\}_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}$ ] .    with this result",
    "we can , for each @xmath5 and receiver index @xmath3 , find the minimal set of @xmath14 s fourier series coefficients , from which we can simultaneously approximate the set @xmath81 . denoting the set of indices corresponding to these coefficients by @xmath97 ,",
    "arrange the set @xmath98\\right\\}_{k\\in\\kappa_m}$ ] in a length @xmath99 vector @xmath100 .",

    "is obtained with just a small sampling overhead .",
    "our final xampling scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] .",
    "note the simple mechanism used for obtaining the fourier coefficients in each individual element : a linear transformation , @xmath105 , is applied to point - wise samples of the signal , taken at a sub - nyquist rate , after filtering it with an appropriate kernel , @xmath106 , such as the sum of sincs  @xcite .",
