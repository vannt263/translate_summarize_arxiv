    "relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) relies on a number of interpretational rules which allow to make measurable predictions . in the non - relativistic limit of quantum theory ( qt ) a state vector",
    "can be defined which evolves according to two laws : ( a )  unitary , continuous time evolution in agreement with the non - relativistic equations of motion and ( b ) the state vector reduction or collapse postulate , which dictates how the state vector changes as a result of measurement .",
    "together , they allow to define a unique state vector history . in the following the notation physical state vector ( psv )",
    "is used for a state vector which , in its coordinate space representation , is well defined at all spacetime points .    for the relativistic theory",
    "the definition of a psv faces difficulties  @xcite due to the fact that spacelike measurements which are instantaneous in one inertial frame are no longer instantaneous in another .",
    "collapse has to take place in a covariant fashion .",
    "this requirement restricts us to using light cone sections .",
    "it turns out that the forward light cone ( flc ) is insufficient , as follows most stringent from experiments ( see  @xcite and references therein ) performed in connection with measuring violations of bell s  @xcite inequalities .",
    "indeed , a prescription for reduction on the backward light cone ( blc ) was already proposed in an early paper  @xcite on the subject .",
    "but , subsequently aharonov and albert  @xcite ( aa ) concluded that a relativistically satisfactory version of the collapse postulate can not be found at all .",
    "their analysis relies on constructing _ local devices _ which allow to monitor a _",
    "non - local history_. as stressed by them , the empirical meaning of their procedure is crucial",
    ". otherwise it would be without physical content to assert that the system is in an eigenstate of some non - local operator and , being in such a state , excluding collapse on the blc . in summary , aa state that the relativistic theory still has the capacity to predict probabilities , but lacks the capacity to define a consistent psv .",
    "it is one purpose of the present paper to show that measurements of the aharonov - albert type are ruled out , once the measurement device is considered to be part of the psv and reduction is understood as a physical process , distinct from unitary and continuous time evolution . in section ii.a the non - relativistic psv evolution is reviewed , followed by introducing its relativistic generalization .",
    "section ii.b introduces an unconventional formulation of the reduction process .",
    "namely , each reduction is attributed to the action of a detector .",
    "for the non - relativistic limit this is shown to agree with the conventional formulation .",
    "the full relativistic spacetime picture is developed in section  ii.c and our rules for reduction are distinct from those of ref.@xcite . it is shown in section  ii.d that aa measurements become impossible within the developed framework .    to give some illustrations ,",
    "section  iii deals first with spacelike measurement of charge for a particle which is in a superposition of two waves localized at spacelike positions .",
    "the introduction of aa - like devices ( for a precise definition see there ) does not lead to inconsistencies .",
    "section  ii.b considers spacelike measurements on the entangled singlet state of two distinguishable spin  @xmath0 particles .",
    "this example , also discussed by aharonov and albert , is for various features of interest the technically simplest illustration .",
    "in particular , it turns out that the remains of the aa idea are still sufficient to show inconsistency for the proposal by hellwig and kraus  @xcite . in section iii.c measurement",
    "is briefly discussed for the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state  @xcite , mainly to give an example where three detectors at spacelike positions are involved .",
    "conclusion are drawn in the final section  iv .",
    "we deal with states in the schrdinger picture . the question may arise , whether statistical mixtures ought better to be considered .",
    "let us first have a look at classical physics .",
    "there , the existence of a single state is guaranteed by definition and statistics is an essential tool in view of the practical impossibility to control a large number initial conditions . here",
    "i take a similar stance on qt , i assume that a psv of the world @xmath1 exists , although a complete set of measurements to determine the initial state can not be performed .",
    "the essential feature of qt is that even complete knowledge of the state does only allow stochastic predictions . introducing a density matrix approach at this point , where we are dealing with the fundamental nature of qt , may more obscure than enlighten this central issue .",
    "whether a state or a density matrix reflects the underlying fundamental physics correctly , either case is an assumption , and newton s first rule for reasoning in philosophy decides the matter in favor of the state .      in the following a microscopic object ( photon , electron , proton , etc . ) , as studied in many qt applications , is called quantum object ( qo ) .",
    "let us define @xmath2 in the sense that whenever these symbols are used the indicated limits have to be taken outside of all other operations . in the non - relativistic qt state vectors of qos @xmath3 are defined on the instantaneous hyperplane of @xmath4 spacetime and evolve according to two laws :    \\(a ) unitary , causal time evolution @xmath5 @xmath6 when no measurements are carried out .",
    "\\(b ) an instantaneous , stochastic transformation ( state vector reduction or collapse ) @xmath7 when a measurement is carried out at time @xmath8 .",
    "the initial state @xmath9 can , in principle , uniquely be specified by measuring a complete , commuting set of observables .",
    "let @xmath10 represent operators corresponding to such a set of observables and assume that the possible results of their measurements are given by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where each @xmath11 represents an entire set of eigenvalues and , hence , specifies a unique state @xmath13 for which @xmath14 holds .",
    "assume , the operators of @xmath10 are measured at time @xmath15 , then qt predicts that @xmath11 is found with probability @xmath16 given that the particular set of eigenvalues @xmath11 is observed at time @xmath17 , the state @xmath18 of ( [ law_b ] ) is @xmath19 . in this way a series of complete measurements @xmath20 at times @xmath21 ( where each capital letter represents a complete set of operators ) defines a _ physical state _",
    "history @xmath22 .",
    "this state history can be monitored by performing non - demolition experiments , which measure the last complete set of operators again , before the next reduction .",
    "for instance , for time @xmath23 in the range @xmath24 we would measure the observables @xmath25 .",
    "this reproduces the result @xmath11 with certainty and without disturbing the state @xmath26 .",
    "the idea of a psv has considerable intuitive appeal and should not be given up easily . here",
    "i embark on a starting point which is kind of opposite to the one of ref.@xcite .",
    "assuming the existence of @xmath1 , a distinct understanding of measurements is developed . as explained in the next subsections , each reduction is attributed to a detector and new restrictions emerge , because every detector has to be part of the psv .",
    "while the non - relativistic limit is found to agree with the scenario sketched above , aa measurements become ruled out , and a consistent psv may exist .",
    "first , we need some notation . in the following we call two spacetime points @xmath27 and @xmath28 spacelike when @xmath29 holds . in case of the equal sign",
    ", we assume that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are defined as the limit of points @xmath32 a lorentz covariant spacelike hypersurface ( lcsh ) is now defined to be a hypersurface @xmath33 which fulfills two conditions : ( 1 )  equation  ( [ spacelike ] ) holds for any two points @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "( 2 )  to insure lorentz covariance of the collapse process , @xmath33 is build from light cone sections .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be lcshs .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath37 is said to be in the _ future _ of @xmath36 , when for any two points @xmath34 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 we have @xmath40 , and there exist some such points with @xmath41 .",
    "similarly single spacetime points or sets of such points are defined to be in the future ( or past ) of a lcsh .",
    "finally , for each lcsh @xmath33 hypersurfaces @xmath42 and @xmath43 are defined by taking the time component of all their spacetime points in accordance with the limits defined by equation  ( [ tlimits ] ) .",
    "assume a state vector is initially defined on some lcsh @xmath44 .",
    "its relativistic evolution follows then rules similar to the laws ( a ) and ( b ) :    ( a@xmath45 ) unitary and causal evolution to some lcsh @xmath46 in the future of @xmath44 latexmath:[\\[\\label{law_a ' }     when no reduction happens on any hypersurface in - between @xmath46 and @xmath44 .",
    "( b@xmath45 ) a stochastic transformation latexmath:[\\[\\label{law_b ' }     on @xmath37 . from @xmath49",
    "the state vector evolves to a next lcsh @xmath50 by unitary and causal evolution . on @xmath51 reduction takes place , and so on .",
    "the process is graphically depicted in figure  1 .",
    "a light cone section becomes added to the initial lcsh @xmath36 such that the created surface @xmath37 is in the future of @xmath36 .",
    "on @xmath37 reduction takes place from @xmath46 to @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath53 surfaces are not explicitly indicated in figure  1 , their locations are obvious . in the next subsection we consider the reduction  ( b@xmath45 ) in detail and come to a process where the addition of a single new light cone section ( not spelled out in rule ( a@xmath45 ) ) is typical",
    ". by reasons explained then , the definition of reduction in ( b@xmath45 ) is not entirely identical with the one of ( b ) .",
    "namely , some measurements will constitute reductions and others not .",
    "this is just a notational issue .",
    "the physical content of ( a ) and ( b ) is fully recovered in the non - relativistic limit of ( a@xmath45 ) and ( b@xmath45 ) .",
    "in particular , for the speed of light @xmath54 the lcsh of figure  1 becomes the instantaneous hyperplane .",
    "from the fact that experimental measurements are made , it follows that it is possible to construct bound states @xmath55 , called detectors , which have the ability to perform them .",
    "eventually the detector may project some quantum state on an eigenstate of certain operators , or onto a state out of the space of eigenstates in case that the eigenvalue in question is degenerate .",
    "i proceed with a description in terms of the psv : a detector @xmath55 can be constructed and a qo @xmath56 ( for instance a single electron ) can be prepared , such that over some time  @xcite period the factorization @xmath57 describes the rest of the world , is meaningful in the following sense : although , due to interactions , this factorization can never be exact , the evolution of latexmath:[\\[\\label{psi }    describes nevertheless the features we are interested in correctly and proceeds as follows . initially there is very little overlap between the wave functions of the qo and of the detector , such that approximately latexmath:[\\[\\label{detector }    @xmath56 and @xmath55 interact and this is expressed by the notation @xmath59 , which is already used in equations ( [ wfct ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) . at some point in its spacetime",
    "the detector performs a transition @xmath60 constitutes a measurement of an observable or set of observables @xmath61 , according to the purpose for which the detector was constructed .",
    "the measurement ( [ measure ] ) is here interpreted as a physical ability of the detector . besides avoiding the word reduction at the moment and emphasizing the role of the detector as part of a state vector this is not distinct from standard qt . in the non - relativistic limit complete measurements  ( [ complete ] )",
    "can be performed to the extent that it is possible to design a detector which measures the complete set of operators  @xmath10 such that the state @xmath62 factorizes in the form latexmath:[\\[\\label{factor }    @xmath13 is the eigenstate of ( [ complete ] ) and the state @xmath64 allows us to access this information ( through the neglected interactions with @xmath65 ) .",
    "it should be noted that for real detectors the factorization ( [ factor ] ) is the exception and not the rule .",
    "to give one example , to measure the @xmath66 spin component of an electron ala stern - gerlach one does first split the electron wave function by employing a magnetic field .",
    "subsequently one detects the electron in one of two alternative branches , for instance by using a channel electron multiplier ( cem ) which actually digests the electron .",
    "we may employ just one cem , say in the branch corresponding to @xmath67 , and distinguish two states of the cem : @xmath55 when nothing happens and @xmath68 when a signal current is put out .",
    "the interpretation of the latter case is that a @xmath67 electron has been detected .",
    "further , if the detection efficiency would be 100% and we could make sure by some initial measurement that one electron enters the device , we would interpret the @xmath55 state as a measurement of @xmath69 . in practice",
    ", one would rather count the electron in the @xmath69 branch with a second cem . to stay close with what actually happens ,",
    "we use in the following the symbol @xmath70 to denote measurement results , with the understanding that factorization ( [ factor ] ) is included as a special case .",
    "we are now ready to define reduction . for the measurement process ( [ measure ] )",
    "we distinguish two cases :    \\(1 ) @xmath71 holds for the initial qo . then the transformation ( [ measure ] ) appears to be consistent with the time evolution ( a@xmath45 ) and we assume that this is indeed the case .",
    "for the just given practical example this would be when an electron is either initially prepared in the spin @xmath67 state and the resulting detector state is @xmath72 , or when the electron is initially prepared in the @xmath69 state and the resulting detector state is @xmath55 .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and @xmath75 holds for the initial qo .",
    "then the transformation ( [ measure ] ) appears to be inconsistent with the time evolution ( a@xmath45 ) .",
    "we assume that this is indeed the case and understand reduction ( b@xmath45 ) as a physical law distinct from ( a@xmath45 ) . in the following",
    "we limit the definition of reduction strictly to the situation where it constitutes an interruption of the time evolution  ( a@xmath45 ) . for",
    "our practical example reduction would , for instance , take place when the electron is initially prepared in an @xmath76 eigenstate , say @xmath77 .",
    "the possible outcomes , each with 50% probability , are then the cem states @xmath55 versus @xmath68 , both somehow labelled by the superscript @xmath78 in equation  ( [ measure ] ) .    case ( 1 ) is measurement without reduction .",
    "when , in addition , also the factorization ( [ factor ] ) holds , we have a non - demolition measurement .",
    "although not every measurement constitutes now a reduction , every detector has to be attributed the ability to perform reductions .",
    "this follows from the fact that a detector is a device constructed for performing measurements of some observable(s ) on certain qos .",
    "we can then confront the detector with a qo which is prepared to have some component orthogonal to the measured eigenstate(s ) . according to the standard rules of qt",
    ", the detector has then to make a decision between the eigenstate(s ) and the orthogonal complement , _",
    "i.e. _ performs a reduction in the sense just defined .",
    "to move , in a finite time , from one detector state to another requires a difference in energy distribution @xmath79 . assuming that the only driving property which constitute the ability to perform reductions is being a boundstate confronted with a ( not necessarily macroscopic ) difference in energy distribution @xmath79 , a heuristic approach to quantum measurement was developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "subsequently , this motivated the present work , which may allow to express the ideas of  @xcite within a more appropriate framework .",
    "relevant questions about the physical nature of detectors are postponed to future work .",
    "this paper is devoted to defining a psv and the next subsection deals with the central issue of constructing a relativistically consistent spacetime picture for the reduction process .",
    "we consider non - overlapping detectors @xmath80 each localized in a well - defined spacetime region .",
    "the basic idea is that these detectors perform reductions in a well - defined order , which in the following is called _ reduction order _ and indicated by the symbol  @xmath81 .",
    "the labelling of the detectors may be chosen such that the reduction order @xmath82 holds .",
    "if detectors measure at _ timelike _ positions with respect to one another , their reduction order is requested to agree with the time order of the measurements : @xmath83 . for detectors at _ spacelike",
    "_ positions the reduction order is still assumed to exist , but does no longer correspond to a well - defined time order .",
    "we use the reduction order to construct a psv @xmath84 in spacetime . as spacelike",
    "operators commute , measurable effects are supposed to be independent of the chosen reduction order .    by assumption , the psv is initially defined on a lcsh @xmath44 : @xmath85 and all reductions happen in the future ( as defined in ii.a ) of @xmath44 .",
    "detector @xmath86 is first in reduction order .",
    "some section of its blc is in the future of @xmath44 and denoted @xmath87 .",
    "the next lcsh @xmath46 is obtained by replacing the part of @xmath44 which is in the past of @xmath87 by @xmath88 . by unitary and causal time evolution of law",
    "( a@xmath45 ) the psv becomes defined on @xmath46 : @xmath89 .",
    "this is always possible , because the definition of the reduction order makes sure that no reduction process can be in the way .",
    "for this causal evolution it is sufficient to know the psv on the section of @xmath44 which is within the blc of the detector s reduction position . on @xmath37 detector",
    "@xmath86 performs then the stochastic reduction of law  ( b@xmath45 ) and the psv becomes defined on @xmath49 : latexmath:[$|\\psi\\rangle =     @xmath44 is at @xmath91 for all its space points , then @xmath37 is just the blc of @xmath86 .",
    "involving detector @xmath92 , the promotion of the psv from @xmath49 to @xmath50 and from there to @xmath93 follows precisely the same scheme . by induction",
    "we proceed from detector to detector , always promoting the lcsh , with the psv defined on it , forward in time : @xmath94 in the sense of time - ordering of lcshs .",
    "should there be a last detector , we can promote the psv by unitary and causal time evolution to @xmath95 for all space points .",
    "figure  2 illustrates a situation involving three detectors .",
    "our construction exploits the fact that spacelike operators commute to attribute each reduction to the action of a local detector .",
    "despite the fact that the reduction order can not be verified experimentally , this has some physical appeal .",
    "in contrast to this the procedure proposed by hellwig and kraus  @xcite is entirely formal and remains inconsistent ( see section  iii.b ) even after our critical assessment of aa measurements .",
    "the statement of aharonov and albert ( aa ) is that it is possible to design procedures which combine several local interactions to measure some non - local property of the quantum system .",
    "for instance , they propose two arrays of devices , called aa devices henceforth , to measure the non - local variable @xmath96 of two distinguishable particles .",
    "these devices interact with the quantum system @xmath97 through the hamiltonian @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the position of particle @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the position of the @xmath102th aa device corresponding to particle @xmath100 , and @xmath103 is some internal variable of the device .",
    "the coupling @xmath104 is non - zero only during a short interval @xmath105 , when the devices are switched on .",
    "the position of particle @xmath100 becomes then coupled to the canonical conjugate momentum @xmath106 of array @xmath100 , where @xmath107 is the canonical conjugate momentum of the correspondingly labelled aa device .",
    "aa claim that it is possible to prepare all devices in initial states such that , when separated , they allow for measurement @xmath96 , but not for measurement of @xmath31 , @xmath108 or @xmath109 , in accordance with @xmath110 = 0 ~~{\\rm but}~~   \\left [ \\pi_j , q_1+q_2 \\right ] \\ne 0 ~~{\\rm and}~~ \\left [ \\pi_1+\\pi_2 , q_1+q_2 \\right ] \\ne 0\\,.\\ ] ] see equations ( 7 ) to ( 16 ) in their paper @xcite for more details .",
    "let us try to combine the aa approach with the concept of measurement developed in this paper .",
    "first , the interactions of nature can not be turned on and off at will .",
    "they are all supposed to be described by the lagrangian @xmath111 of a fundamental qft .",
    "however , this point is minor .",
    "it is perfectly reasonable to assume that we can prepare aa devices @xmath112 such that , through preparation of their initial state , their interaction with the quantum system @xmath97 is effectively described by hamiltonians @xmath113 with @xmath114 given by  ( [ aa ] ) .",
    "a second minor point is that in practice we can only employ a finite number of such devices , say @xmath115 .",
    "it makes sense to assume that such a finite discretization still gives , within certain limitations of accuracy and response efficiency , the desired result .",
    "hence , the relevant state vector is @xmath116 ) . in particular , at times when interaction takes place the expression @xmath117 is appropriate to indicate it , compare equation  ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "this product structure of devices limits non - local measurement severely and can not be avoided , because every degree of freedom in qft enters as a factor into the state vector .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the non - local operator @xmath118 ( the terminal points of the two aa arrays are at spacelike positions ) has no representation in terms of detectors .",
    "devices as imagined in the aa paper can not be part of the state vector",
    ".    one may want to address the question , to where the state vector ( [ aastate ] ) eventually leads us .",
    "neither of the two aa arrays alone can be a detector .",
    "namely , by its purpose array @xmath100 is not allowed to produce a definite result for its conjugate momentum @xmath119 and hence a local measurement of the position @xmath99 of particle @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "the only way the aa devices could possibly function is through unitary and causal interaction with the quantum system @xmath120 , then feeding the gained information into a final device @xmath121 which is a detector .",
    "each of the two aa arrays has to be positioned within the blc of the spacetime point at which detector @xmath122 performs its measurements in accordance with the scheme developed in the previous two sections .",
    "in the rest of this paper we interpret aa devices in this sense ( aa - like devices in the introduction and in the figure captions ) .",
    "not only our notion of measurement is distinct from aa , but also our notion of a psv . as element in fock space",
    "our psv exist only on certain spacelike hyperplanes ( never cross reduction lines ! ) . however , where it does not exist it can not be monitored .",
    "an example is given in section  iii.a .",
    "in the next subsection we deal with detection of a single , charged particle by detectors @xmath86 and @xmath92 at spacelike positions .",
    "in addition it is shown why non - local monitoring , involving two aa devices and a third detector @xmath122 fails .    in the other subsections we work out various examples of spacelike measurements on states made from distinguishable spin  @xmath123 particles .",
    "detectors are denoted by @xmath86 , @xmath92 and @xmath122 and assumed to act at spacelike positions in reduction order @xmath124 ( or in a different reduction order when explicitly stated ) .",
    "each detector can measure the spin of an incoming particle with respect to one of @xmath78 different axis @xmath125 , @xmath115 .",
    "as the particles are distinguishable , we can ( and do ) label them by the detectors which eventually measure them .",
    "the following equation defines then eigenstates with respect to the axis @xmath125 as measured by detector @xmath86 @xmath126 where the superscripts @xmath127 and @xmath128 label the @xmath129 and @xmath130 eigenstates , respectively .",
    "the same notation is used for the other detectors , replacing @xmath86 by @xmath92 or @xmath122 ( and @xmath131 by @xmath132 or @xmath133 ) .",
    "we consider a single charged particle which has been split by a magnetic field into a superposition of two localized waves @xmath134 where @xmath135 heads towards detector @xmath86 and @xmath136 towards detector @xmath92 along the lines indicated in figure  3  @xcite .",
    "each detector will measure simply whether a charged particle comes in or not .",
    "the initial lcsh @xmath36 is chosen to be at @xmath91 , out of the picture .",
    "aa devices are positioned on spacetime worldlines @xmath137 and @xmath138 of this figure ( as they are not measurement devices the same kind of lines as for qos are used ) . in the present example",
    "we assume that the charged particle is scalar or an electron with given spin .",
    "the no - cloning theorem  @xcite does then allow to assume that an aa device is able to make a copy of the state it encounters and to send this copy to the detector  @xmath122 . without bothering about the experimental feasibility",
    ", this seems to be the most favorable assumption about the eventual performance of such devices .",
    "the copy will be denoted by @xmath139 when originating from aa device @xmath140 .",
    "detector @xmath122 performs the same kind of measurement as detectors @xmath86 and @xmath92 do and allows to trace the direction from where the charged particle comes .",
    "detector @xmath86 reduces the state vector on the lcsh @xmath37 . on the @xmath46 side of this surface",
    "the psv , obtained from @xmath44 by unitary and causal time evolution , reads @xmath141 where the state vector includes detectors and aa devices .",
    "@xmath137 has created the copy @xmath142 of @xmath135 .",
    "the reduction ( 100% efficiency assumed ) by detector @xmath86 transforms @xmath143 either into @xmath144 indicates that a charged particle has been detected , or into latexmath:[\\[\\label{s1b }     when no particle is detected by @xmath86 . in either case",
    "@xmath143 is then defined on the lcsh @xmath49 .",
    "continuing with  ( [ s1a ] ) , the final state state , defined on the spacelike surface @xmath146 of figure  3 , will be @xmath147 _ i.e. _ a charged particle has now also been detected by detector @xmath122 in a measurement which is not a reduction . as the picture for this case is rather obvious ,",

    "is not conserved on all spacelike hyperplanes . as charge",
    "is a superselection rule , this means on such hyperplanes a psv as vector in fock space does not exist .",
    "our example enlightens that these non - existing states can not be monitored and our psv evolution remains empirically satisfactory .      as in the previous subsection the @xmath36 lcsh is moved to @xmath91 . including the detectors @xmath86 and @xmath92",

    "the final reduction simply reads @xmath166 note that the reduction performed by @xmath92 is entirely local , affecting the psv only in the immediate neighbourhood of @xmath92 .",
    "given axis @xmath125 for @xmath86 and @xmath164 for @xmath92 , let us find the qt probability @xmath167 that @xmath155 is measured by @xmath86 and @xmath165 by @xmath92 . for the reduction step from ( [ singlet ] ) to ( [ sreda ] )",
    "the probability is @xmath168 \\right|^2 = { 1\\over 2}\\ ] ] and for the step ( [ sredb ] ) it is @xmath169 .",
    "together this implies @xmath170 note that for @xmath171 the matrix element becomes @xmath172 : detector @xmath92 still measures , but no reduction takes place . finally , the reader can easily verify that the same probability @xmath167 , namely @xmath173 , is obtained when @xmath92 measures @xmath165 first in reduction order , and @xmath86 measures then  @xmath155 .",
    "we compare now with the construction by hellwig and kraus  @xcite . as in figure  3 of their paper ,",
    "regions  1 to  4 are defined in our figure  6 .",
    "positions of the detectors @xmath86 and @xmath92 are identical with those in figure  5 , but now both blcs are drawn .",
    "we ignore detector @xmath122 at the moment and construct a state on a spacelike hypersurface within one region of figure  6 by crossing all worldline available there , but never leaving the region .",
    "for the measurement process described above , we obtain the following results :    * equation ( [ singlet ] ) in region 1 .",
    "* @xmath174 in region 2 due to measurement at @xmath92 . * @xmath175 in region 3 due to measurement at @xmath86 , compare equation  ( [ sreda ] ) .",
    "* @xmath176 in region 4 , compare equation  ( [ sredb ] ) .",
    "the major difference to the construction of this paper is that the assignment in the regions  2 and  3 is a formal one , defining the results as if both detectors @xmath86 and @xmath92 would have carried out their reductions .",
    "serious consequences are implied .",
    "let us introduce aa devices @xmath137 and @xmath138 as in the previous subsection , see figure  3 .",
    "they create the state @xmath177 in region  2 and @xmath178 in region  3 .",
    "this amounts to sending the copy state @xmath179 to detector @xmath122 , resulting in the conditional probability @xmath180 in case that detector @xmath122 measures the spin of particle @xmath181 with respect to the @xmath164 axis and the spin of particle @xmath182 with respect to the @xmath125 axis .",
    "this probability is in disagreement with qt ( _ i.e. _ false ) .",
    "in contrast , the reduction process of this paper stays correct by the simple fact that @xmath122 performs just another spacelike , local measurement ( _ i.e _ commutes with @xmath86 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "straightforward but lengthy algebra allows to verify explicitly that all reduction orders lead to the same result . for the remainder of this subsection , we follow our standard order @xmath124 and include @xmath183  devices .    at the positions indicated in figure  3 we imagine the aa devices @xmath137 and @xmath138 in figure  5 . for notational convenience , we do no longer include detectors and aa devices explicitly . after passing @xmath137",
    "the state vector becomes then @xmath184 when reduction by detector @xmath86 has produced the measurement result @xmath155 we have @xmath185 and this happens with with probability ( [ prob1 ] ) . after passing @xmath138",
    "the state vector becomes @xmath186 remarkable with this equation are two points : ( 1 ) the same result is obtained when passing @xmath138 proceeds the reduction by detector @xmath86 .",
    "( 2 )  due to the locality of their interaction , the aa devices are unable to copy ( _ i.e. _ measure non - locally ) the fully entangled state  ( [ singlet ] ) , which would be latexmath:[\\[\\sim\\ \\",
    "{ |c_1^{k-}\\rangle\\ ,    expression would have to show up as a simple overall factor .",
    "instead , the copying process has produced a new entanglement .",
    "the device has no ability to monitor non - locally the spin zero content of the initial state , as envisioned in  @xcite .",
    "still , this new entanglement is non - local enough to produce an inconsistency for the prescription proposed by hellwig and kraus .",
    "namely , the reduction by @xmath92 for the measurement @xmath165 yields @xmath188 where the constant is determined by the normalization condition @xmath189 .",
    "the probability for this to happen is a bit lengthy and spared the reader , because it is not really of importance .",
    "important is , once it happened the conditional probability that detector @xmath122 finds @xmath190 for particle @xmath181 and @xmath191 for particle @xmath182 is in general less than one , as follows from calculating @xmath192 .",
    "a ghz state  @xcite is a state of three distinguishable spin  @xmath123 particles which gained some popularity  @xcite as a theoretical example for which local realistic theories and qt differ in 100% of the results for some measurements . here",
    "our interest in it is limited to illustrating reduction for a case involving three detectors . for the following discussion",
    "we define @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 and do not consider any other axis .",
    "reduction for our standard order is depicted in figure  7 . including the detectors , one of the eight ghz states reads  @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\label{ghz }       |a^{3+}\\rangle\\,|b^{3+}\\rangle\\,|c^{3+}\\rangle   - |a^{3-}\\rangle\\,|b^{3-}\\rangle\\,|c^{3-}\\rangle \\}\\ ,    @xmath86 measures the @xmath76 spin component and that the result is @xmath129 .",
    "the corresponding reduction is @xmath197 next , let @xmath92 measures @xmath198 and the result is assumed to be @xmath129 again . then the reduction on @xmath51 of figure  7 is @xmath199 reductions ( [ greda ] ) and ( [ gredb ] ) are both non - local .",
    "note that the geometry of figure  7 is chosen such that the change affecting particle @xmath200 happens in a region where @xmath51 falls , up to the proper definition of limits , on @xmath37 .",
    "this is the reason why different line symbols are used to indicate the continuation of the @xmath163 and @xmath200 worldlines after reduction .",
    "the reduction for @xmath163 is on @xmath37 , whereas @xmath200 undergoes two reductions : on @xmath37 and @xmath51 in a region where these surfaces fall on top of one another .",
    "the final reduction by detector @xmath122 is local and when detector @xmath122 measures @xmath198 the result is with certainty @xmath129 , _",
    "i.e. _ a measurement without reduction .",
    "the central point of this paper is that it is possible to understand reduction in qft as a _ fundamental physical process_. each reduction is performed _ locally _ by a detector , whereas the consequences can be _ global_. essential for such an interpretation of the reduction process is the existence of a consistent spacetime picture .",
    "this was shown by explicit construction of a psv .",
    "in contrast to the non - relativistic limit the psv can no longer be monitored , because the order in which detectors at spacelike separations perform their reductions can not be verified experimentally . therefore , the developed spacetime picture has not to be taken literally .",
    "potentially , our framework is a building block of a theory of reduction .",
    "it opens the door towards investigating questions like : which conglomerates of matter have under which circumstances the ability to perform reductions ( _ i.e. _ can act as detectors ) ? are there frequency laws of reduction ? these issues will be addressed in future work .",
    "preliminary thoughts exist  @xcite and , actually , motivated the present investigation .",
    "the goal is to formulate reduction as a stochastic process , which goes on independently of whether measurements are performed or not , such that the measurement process becomes explained .",
    "interestingly , there can then be experimental implications beyond standard qt which allow to verify such a stochastic process .",
