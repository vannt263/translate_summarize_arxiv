    "until recently , little was known about the population of transient sources at low radio frequencies due to the lack of previous dedicated , sensitive surveys .",
    "many of the known target transient populations are synchrotron sources , hence predicted to be faint and vary on long timescales at low radio frequencies ( such as afterglows from gamma - ray bursts and tidal disruption events ; for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "however , there are a number of different populations of sources that are expected to emit short duration bursts of low frequency coherent radio emission and are anticipated to be detectable in short snapshot low radio frequency images ( e.g. giant pulses from pulsars and flares from brown dwarfs or exoplanets ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one such coherently emitting target is the population of fast radio bursts ( frbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "frbs were discovered at 1.4 ghz using high time resolution observations from the parkes radio telescope .",
    "these sources constitute single , non - repeating , bright pulses of millisecond duration at 1.4 ghz that are highly dispersed , suggesting an extra - galactic origin .",
    "a number of theories have been proposed as the progenitors of frbs , including both extra - galactic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and galactic origins ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the scattering for frbs is highly dependent upon the observing frequency and is expected to smear out the pulse to much longer durations at low radio frequencies @xcite .",
    "the pulse durations at low radio frequencies make them more difficult to detect using standard search methods at high time resolution . instead",
    ", their durations are expected to be comparable to those attainable in short snapshot images .",
    "however , it is unclear what the rates of frbs at low frequencies will be because the rates are still being constrained at higher frequencies and little is known about their spectral shape ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , observations at low frequencies will aid in constraining both the rates and the spectral slopes of frbs . by more tightly constraining the rates ,",
    "some progenitor mechanisms may be ruled out , including those associated with other populations with relatively low rates ( such as short gamma - ray bursts ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally all frbs to date have been detected using single dish telescopes leading to large positional uncertainties ( e.g. 14 arcmin ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by detecting frbs in short snapshot image plane data",
    "observed using a low frequency radio interferometer , their positions can be constrained to higher accuracy ( @xmath31 arcmin ) enabling host galaxy associations and deep constraints on multi - wavelength counterparts .",
    "additionally , an interferometer will obtain more reliable flux densities , as single dish observations are subject to flux density uncertainties as the position of the source within the primary beam is unknown .",
    "this provides better constraints on the flux density distribution of sources ( @xmath6@xmath7 distribution ) .    over the past few years",
    ", the search for transient sources at low radio frequencies has intensified with the arrival of sensitive , wide - field instruments such as the murchison wide - field array ( mwa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the low frequency array ( lofar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the long wavelength array station 1 ( lwa1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the automated processing of very large datasets is being enabled via the long - term source monitoring capabilities of specially developed pipelines , including the lofar transients pipeline ( trap ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the pipeline for the askap survey for variables and slow transients ( vast ; * ? ? ?",
    "dedicated transient surveys are utilising the improvement in instrumentation and software to constrain the surface densities of transients at these low frequencies on a range of timescales and sensitivities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity or search area will be required to more tightly constrain their rates .",
    "this can be attained by the next generation of radio telescopes , such as the square kilometre array ( ska ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , obtaining the required observation time may be difficult on over - subscribed instruments and transient surveys will need to utilise commensal observations .",
    "this paper uses observations from one such dataset , the mwa observations for the campaign to detect the epoch of re - ionisation ( eor ) in which hundreds of hours of observing time are required on individual fields .",
    "this dataset can probe variability and transients on timescales ranging from seconds up to years , enabling constraints to be placed on both the long timescale incoherent emission mechanisms , e.g. synchrotron emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , short timescale coherent emission mechanisms such as frbs and scintillation processes on a range of timescales .",
    "this paper describes a pilot transient and variability search using 78 hours of the mwa eor dataset , producing highly competitive transient rates .",
    "the 28 second snapshot timescale is chosen to specifically target the expected population of frbs .",
    "this work complements @xcite , a search for frbs using mwa observations imaged on a much shorter integration time ( 2 seconds ) and conducting an image plane de - dispersion to search for frbs . via this method ,",
    "@xcite are able to attain an improvement in sensitivity for frbs in comparison to the standard processing strategies at the expense of processing speed and resolution . whereas a standard imaging strategy , such as that utilised in this paper , enables more observations to be processed in a comparable timescale and the use of the data products for additional science such as longer duration transient and variability studies . without de - dispersion ,",
    "a dispersed frb will be detected at a lower flux density in the short snapshot images as the original signal is averaged over both time and frequency .",
    "therefore , these two approaches are complementary ; @xcite increases sensitivity by sacrificing surveyed area whereas the survey conducted in this paper sacrifices sensitivity to increase the amount of surveyed area .",
    "additionally , candidate frbs identified in this analysis can be independently confirmed as frbs by measuring their dispersed signal using the pipeline developed @xcite .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes the processing strategies used to make all the images and the analysis strategies implemented to conduct quality control and to search for transient sources . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the limits on transients detected on a range of timescales and focus on the implications for the rates and spectral shapes of frbs by comparison to previous studies at other frequencies .",
    "finally , section 4 provides an initial analysis of variability of known sources within the field .",
    "the data used in this paper are obtained from a commensally observed dataset for the transients team and the eor team .",
    "the full dataset comprises of @xmath81000 hours targeting 3 specific fields , well off the galactic plane , centred on 2 different observing frequencies ( 154 and 182 mhz ) .",
    "processing the full dataset is a `` big data '' scale computational challenge due to the supercomputing time required and the data volume at all of the processing stages . by targeting a subsample of the dataset , we can develop automated strategies to make the data volume more manageable and quantify the supercomputing requirements for the full dataset . in this study",
    ", we choose observations of a single target field , centred on ra : 0.00 deg , dec : -27.00 deg ( 00:00:00 , @xmath927:00:00 ; j2000 ) , at the observing frequency of 182 mhz and at elevations of @xmath875 degrees .",
    "this field is centred on the galactic co - ordinates l : 30.636 deg , b : -78.553 deg ( 30:38:08.4 , -78:33:10.6 ) .",
    "the observations were conducted by taking multiple pointed observations as the field drifts through 5 different azimuth - elevation pointing directions centred on zenith .",
    "these observations were then phase centred to ra : 0.00 dec : @xmath927.00 deg ( j2000 ) , with a primary beam half width half maximum ( hwhm ) of 11.3 degrees .",
    "this leads to a sample size of 3010 individual observations of 2 minute integration times , or 100 hours , in the time range 2013 august 23  2014 september 14 .",
    ".the wsclean settings used to image all the observations presented in this analysis .",
    "all other settings were the default settings . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for this section , we put all the images through trap utilising the monitoring strategy described in section 2.6 and monitor the variability of sources detected in the median image with flux densities in excess of 0.5 jy .",
    "as stated previously , there are residual primary beam issues when comparing images at different az - el pointing directions so we process each pointing direction separately .",
    "variable candidates are then compared between each of the pointing directions .",
    "trap measures two key variability parameters for every unique source in the dataset .",
    "the first parameter is the reduced weighted @xmath10 at a given observing frequency , @xmath11 , given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of datapoints , @xmath14 is the flux density of a datapoint , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the error on the @xmath17-th flux density measurement and over bars represent the mean values ( the full derivation of this from the standard reduced weighted @xmath10 is given in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the second parameter is the coefficient of variation ( also known as the modulation index ) at each observing frequency , @xmath18 , given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the standard deviation of the observed flux densities .",
    "these parameters are measured for each time step that the source is observed . in the following analysis , we focus on the variability parameters for each unique source from the final time step .                in figure [ variplt ]",
    ", we show these variability parameters from the end of each trap run for each of the 5 unique azimuth - elevation pointing directions .",
    "as the timescales probed by each of the different pointing directions is roughly the same , it is expected that the typical source parameters for the different pointing directions will be in good agreement and this is clearly the case in figure [ variplt ] . the @xmath18 distribution is well fitted with a gaussian distribution , with a typical value of @xmath21 , consistent with the typical flux density uncertainties measured in section 2.8 .",
    "we note that the absolute @xmath11 values should be a factor @xmath03 lower due to the correlated noise observed in these images ( see section 2.4 ) ; this does not affect the analysis in this section as we are only considering sources that are anomalous to the distribution .",
    "this factor will need to be considered when quantifying low level variability in future analysis .",
    "the @xmath11 distribution is clearly right - skewed with an excess of sources at higher values , suggesting that there may be variability in some of the source light curves . however , as the @xmath18 parameters of these sources are comparable to the rest of the population , this is unlikely ( variable sources have anomalously high values for both variability parameters and are expected reside in the top right corner of this plot ) . by visual inspection",
    ", we note that many sources show variation on specific nights , pointing to a possible ionospheric origin or residual calibration issues .",
    "further analysis is ongoing .",
    "using additional source parameters ( particularly the maximum flux density that a source attains and the ratio between that maximum flux density and the average flux density of the source ) can aid in understanding the population of sources and can be used to more clearly separate the variable sources from a stable population . in figure",
    "[ variplt2 ] , we plot these 4 parameters for each of the different pointing directions .",
    "we see a clear correlation between the maximum flux density and @xmath11 as expected ( this is caused by the measurement accuracy of flux densities for bright sources , which does not take into account systematic uncertainties ) . additionally , we observe a negative trend between the maximum flux densities and @xmath18",
    ", however there is a clear diversion from this trend at flux densities @xmath82 jy . this diversion is caused by a large number of images , coincident in time , having a systematic flux density scale offset ( of order 10% ) from the rest of the images .",
    "this is likely caused by uncertainties in the primary beam model and is expected to be resolved in future work when we address the issues between different pointing directions .    to avoid the region where the systematic uncertainties are dominating ,",
    "we utilise a @xmath22 threshold on both the @xmath11 and @xmath18 parameters to identify variable sources .",
    "this corresponds to variable sources requiring @xmath23 and @xmath24 , equivalent to a flux density variation in excess of 20% .",
    "these thresholds will only identify sources which are significantly more variable than the typical population and does not address any intrinsic low level variability , such as the phenomenon of `` low frequency variability '' likely caused by refractive interstellar scintillation ( although this is not expected to occur in our dataset as it typically has timescales of @xmath51 year and is more prevalent at lower galactic latitudes ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . from the skewed @xmath11 distribution and visual inspection of a large number of light curves , we note that there is low - level variability on specific observing nights which may correspond to ionospheric activity .",
    "no significantly variable sources were identified via this method .",
    "two sources within this field have observed variability , with timescales of 2 seconds at @xmath0150 mhz , which has been interpreted as interplanetary scintillation ( ips ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the zenith observations , we identify these two sources within our dataset and determine their variability parameters .",
    "pks 2322 - 275 has @xmath25 and @xmath26 and pks 2318 - 195 has @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "both of these sources are well below the variability thresholds and their parameters are highly typical for the source population .",
    "@xcite show that these sources have a typical variability timescale which is significantly shorter then the 30 second integration timescale used in this analysis .",
    "therefore , any ips events would be statistically averaged to the mean value in these images .",
    "additionally , there is one pulsar within the field , psr 2327 - 20 .",
    "this pulsar has a low dm and , hence , may undergo diffractive and refractive scintillation . in our median image , we note that this source is very faint , with a flux density of @xmath00.07 jy , and is unlikely to be detected in our images .",
    "we monitored the position of this pulsar to see if this pulsar scintillates above the detection threshold .",
    "psr 2327 - 20 is not detected in any of the snapshot images .",
    "although this analysis has not identified any significant variability , we note that the variability analysis needs a significant amount of further work to be able to identify variability of sources corresponding to @xmath2920% of their flux densities . for future analysis :    * we intend to resolve remaining systematic primary beam uncertainties within the images .",
    "this will enable all the pointing directions to be processed at once , giving a much larger dataset for characterising the sources .",
    "additionally , it will resolve the deviation in @xmath18 at flux densities in excess of 2 jy , which will lead to an increase in sensitivity . * the variability parameters for",
    "sources can change significantly as the number of data points in the light curve increase .",
    "for instance , if a source emits a single flare at early times this variability may not be apparent using the variability parameters from the final time step in the dataset .",
    "this means that we may be missing interesting variability on short timescales due to processing large numbers of images at once .",
    "trap records these variability parameters as a function of snapshot and , in future , we aim to develop methods to study the variability of sources as a function of time .",
    "from our analysis of @xmath010,000 images , we note that the eor0 field is remarkably stable at 182 mhz .",
    "there are no convincing transient candidates and all sources have flux density variations of @xmath2920% . in future work , we will target remaining systematic flux density uncertainties to enable us explore low level variation within the field .",
    "the transient surface densities obtained are more constraining than previous surveys by orders of magnitude in timescale , sensitivity and snapshot rates ; although we note that this field is not sensitive to a galactic population of transient sources due to being well off the galactic plane ( galactic latitudes @xmath30 degrees ) . despite expecting to observe transients comparable to the source observed by @xcite , we instead place a constraining limit on their surface densities and/or spectral indices . on the shortest timescale",
    ", predictions scaled from the observed populations suggested that this survey would identify a small number of frbs .",
    "again , there are no detections , which are consistent with suggestions of lower rates and flat spectral indices .    to further pursue these elusive transients at low radio frequencies , we need to conduct similar surveys at a range of frequencies , whilst also increasing the sensitivities and surveyed area by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "finally , there are a range of timescales that this survey does not explore , most notably the very short and @xmath81 year where a range of transient sources are anticipated .",

    "<S> down to a detection threshold of 0.285 jy , no transient candidates were identified , making this the most constraining low - frequency survey to date and placing a limit on the surface density of transients of @xmath1 deg@xmath2 for the shortest timescale considered . at these frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> emission from fast radio bursts ( frbs ) is expected to be detectable in the shortest timescale images without any corrections for interstellar or intergalactic dispersion . at an frb limiting flux density of 7980 jy , we find a rate of @xmath382 frbs per sky per day for dispersion measures @xmath3700 pc @xmath4 . assuming a cosmological population of standard candles , our rate limits are consistent with the frb rates obtained by @xcite if they have a flat spectral slope . finally , we conduct an initial variability survey of sources in the field with flux densities @xmath50.5 jy and identify no sources with significant variability in their lightcurves . however , we note that substantial further work is required to fully characterise both the short term and low level variability within this field .    </S>",
