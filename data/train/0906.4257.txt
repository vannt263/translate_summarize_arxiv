    "qcd is the theory of strong interactions describing quarks and gluons which displays confinement at low energies .",
    "the mechanism behind confinement is still not successfully described .",
    "even if one omits the quarks , the theory remains confining .",
    "therefore , confinement is highly entangled with the dynamics of gluons , which makes glueballs very interesting objects to investigate .",
    "the existence of glueballs would be a pinnacle of the correctness of qcd , however , so far , there is still no clear experimental evidence for the existence of glueballs .",
    "this is mainly due to the mixing of glueball states with meson states which contain quarks . by increasing the statistics and/or by doing more involved experiments creating certain glueball states which can not mix with quark states ( oddballs )",
    ", one hopes to uncover some clear evidence for glueball states .",
    "we mention a few experiments to demonstrate the general interest in glueballs : @xmath3anda @xcite , bes iii @xcite and gluex @xcite , alice at cern @xcite .",
    "+   + the lack of experimental evidence has not stopped the community to widely investigate glueballs in various theoretical models , see @xcite and their references therein .",
    "currently , theoretical estimates of e.g.  masses of the different glueballs are compared to the lattice data . in lattice gauge theories , there is no doubt about the existence of glueballs and one can even work in pure yang - mills gauge theory @xcite .",
    "there are many phenomenological models which contribute to our intuition in glueballs .",
    "more direct contact with fundamental qcd can be made by identifying suitable gauge invariant operators , which carry the correct quantum numbers to create / annihilate particular glueball states @xcite .",
    "this is in accordance with the direct approach to study bound states in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the mass of the glueball can then be determined by the leading singularity in its propagator which , if the glueball is stable , is just a simple pole . of course",
    ", it is necessary to take into account non - perturbative effects , as glueballs are inherently connected to the non - perturbative region of qcd .",
    "one widely used method to estimate these propagators is based on qcd sumrules @xcite , while taking into account condensates , sometimes in combination with instanton or other nonperturbative effects .",
    "also in holographic descriptions of qcd , such glueball correlators have already been investigated , see for instance @xcite .",
    "+   + in this paper , we shall concentrate on identifying a suitable composite operator @xmath4 , which is a renormalization group invariant containing @xmath1 , representing the lightest scalar glueball .",
    "let us explain how we shall take into account a particular source of non - perturbative effects .",
    "for this , we need a bit of background .",
    "as is well known , the faddeev - popov quantization of the yang - mills gauge theory was constructed in order to restrict the path integration only over gauge inequivalent fields .",
    "this restriction is translated at the level of the action by implementing a gauge , e.g.  the landau gauge @xmath5 , through the introduction of extra terms in the action , which in return break the local gauge invariance . in 1977 , gribov showed @xcite that this gauge fixing procedure in yang - mills gauge theories does not entirely restrict the path integration to gauge inequivalent fields , i.e.  there are still multiple gauge copies @xmath6 which all fulfill the landau gauge condition .",
    "moreover , it appeared that the infrared behavior of the gluon and the ghost propagator is strongly influenced when handling these copies .",
    "therefore , there was a need for a formalism which took into account these gribov copies , even if it would be only in a partial way .",
    "after a semiclassical treatment by gribov in @xcite , zwanziger managed to construct an action which analytically implements the restriction to the gribov region @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this action is called the gribov - zwanziger action @xmath8 .",
    "the region @xmath7 is defined as the set of field configurations fulfilling the landau gauge condition and for which the faddeev - popov operator , @xmath9 is strictly positive .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 the boundary , @xmath11 , of the region @xmath7 is called the ( first ) gribov horizon .",
    "the restriction of the path integral to @xmath7 removes most of the gribov copies in the landau gauge related to ( infinitesimal ) gauge transformations @xcite .",
    "however , there are still copies present in @xmath7 and hence a further restriction to the fundamental modular region ( fmr ) , the region free of any gribov copies , should be implemented .",
    "unfortunately , till now , nobody knows how to handle such a restriction to the fmr .",
    "therefore , the best analytical approach to restrict the number of gauge copies is by working with @xmath8 .",
    "we recall that @xmath8 is renormalizable to all orders @xcite , even in the presence of massless @xcite or massive quarks @xcite . implementing",
    "the restriction to the horizon introduces a first non - perturbative mass scale , the so - called gribov parameter @xmath12 .",
    "also , we have found in @xcite that the auxiliary fields introduced by zwanziger to construct the action @xmath8 , develop their own dynamics .",
    "this can introduce a second mass scale into the action .",
    "generally , such non - perturbative mass scales are expected to be transmitted into the pole mass of the correlation functions .",
    "+   + in a previous paper @xcite we have investigated the operator @xmath1 in the ordinary yang - mills theory with landau gauge fixing .",
    "this was already far from being trivial as at the quantum level mixing occurs with two other 4 dimensional operators , i.e.  a brst exact operator @xmath13 , and an operator @xmath14 which vanishes upon using the equations of motion .",
    "we have shown that this mixing does not have consequences when turning to physical states .",
    "indeed , a brst exact operator is always irrelevant at the level of physical states as the yang - mills action is invariant under the brst symmetry . in this paper",
    ", we shall elaborate on the operator @xmath1 by investigating it in the more complex gribov - zwanziger framework , whereby exploiting the construction we have set up in @xcite . in this case , a similar mixing shall occur , but , in contrast with the yang - mills case this mixing shall have consequences at the physical level . indeed , as the gribov - zwanziger action gives rise to a soft breaking of the brst symmetry @xcite , one can figure out that the corresponding brst exact operator which will mix with @xmath15 , will no longer be irrelevant . let us mention that an attempt to calculate the glueball correlator @xmath16 has been done in @xcite , but without taking into account the mixing of @xmath1 with other operators .",
    "we start the paper with an overview of the gribov - zwanziger action in section 2 .",
    "we also recapitulate the refined gribov - zwanziger action which takes into account the dynamics of the new fields introduced by zwanziger . in section 3 , a renormalizable action including the local , non - integrated operator @xmath17 is constructed whereby in section 4 we shall analyze the mixing of this operator to all orders . in section 5",
    ", we shall determine the renormalization group invariant which contains @xmath1 .",
    "we end this paper with a conclusion in section 6 , where we also present some insights on the potential relevance of the soft brst symmetry breaking of the gz action .",
    "in this section we shall shortly recapitulate the ordinary gribov - zwanziger action in euclidean space time which implements the restriction of the path integral to the region @xmath7 . in @xcite , zwanziger derived the following action , @xmath18 with @xmath19 the classical yang - mills action , @xmath20 @xmath21 the faddeev - popov gauge fixing @xmath22 and @xmath23 the horizon function , @xmath24 the horizon condition : @xmath25 with @xmath26 the number of space - time dimensions , needs to be fulfilled in order to assure that we are working with a gauge theory quantized in the landau gauge .",
    "this was proven using statistical arguments in @xcite .",
    "the action @xmath27 contains a non - local term , but one can localize the horizon function by introducing the following set of additional fields : @xmath28 which is a pair of complex conjugate bosonic fields , and @xmath29 , which is a pair of grasmann fields . after this procedure , @xmath27 gets replaced by @xmath8 , which reads @xmath30 with @xmath31 we can further simplify the notation of the additional fields @xmath32 as @xmath33 displays a symmetry with respect to the composite index @xmath34 . therefore , we can set @xmath35 so we get @xmath36 finally , the horizon condition can be written in a more practical version as @xmath37 whereby the quantum action @xmath38 is obtained through the definition @xmath39 { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-s_{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{gz } } } } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 $ ] stands for the integration over all the fields . +   + for the gribov - zwanziger action , the conventional brst symmetry is softly broken @xcite .",
    "we recall that the brst transformations of all the fields are given by @xmath41 the existence of this explicit breaking can be easily checked by releasing the brst transformation @xmath42 onto the action @xmath8 , @xmath43 we refer to @xcite for more details concerning this breaking .",
    "+   + in order to discuss the renormalizability of @xmath8 , we treat the breaking as a composite operator to be introduced into the action by means of a suitable set of external sources .",
    "this procedure can be done in a brst invariant way , by embedding @xmath8 into a larger action , namely @xmath44 whereby @xmath45 we have introduced 4 new sources @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 with the following brst transformations , and @xmath50 this embedding into a larger action is necessary for the algebraic proof of the renormalizability as this heavily relies on having a brst symmetry . replacing the sources with their physical values in the end , returns the gribov - zwanziger action , @xmath51 as one can easily check .",
    "let us explain the origin of the refined gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "in the original gribov - zwanziger framework in 4 dimensions , one obtains an infrared suppressed , positivity violating gluon propagator which tends towards zero for zero momentum and an infrared enhanced ghost propagator .",
    "this behavior of the gluon and the ghost propagator stemming from the action @xmath8 seemed to be in agreement with the lattice results for a long time . until more recently , the authors of @xcite discovered a completely different behavior of the propagators in the deep infrared working on larger lattices .",
    "now the ghost propagator no longer seems to be enhanced and the gluon propagator reaches a finite value at zero momentum . since the publication of @xcite , more lattice data have confirmed these striking results @xcite .",
    "therefore , the gribov - zwanziger framework appeared to be in disagreement with these newest lattice data .",
    "however , in @xcite , we have shown that it is still possible to obtain results with the help of the gribov - zwanziger action which are in qualitative concordance with these new lattice data by taking into account the dynamics of the fields @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54,@xmath55 ) .",
    "this gives rise to additional non - perturbative effects within the gribov - zwanziger framework as , for instance , the dimension two condensate @xmath56 , which has been found @xcite to be proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "it is apparent that the dynamics of these extra fields is highly entangled to the existence of the horizon .",
    "therefore , we have refined the gribov - zwanziger action by explicitly adding the operator @xmath57 from the start , while preserving the renormalizability of the theory . +   + the refined gribov - zwanziger action is thus given by @xmath58 whereby @xmath59 we have introduced a new parameter @xmath60 and a new mass @xmath61 .",
    "the second term @xmath62 is a constant term , which is comparable with the term @xmath63 in the original gribov - zwanziger formulation .",
    "this term will allow us to remain inside the gribov region @xmath7 .",
    "for more details on this construction , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the most natural way to study the lightest scalar glueball is by determining the correlator containing @xmath1 , so we can calculate @xmath64 . ]",
    "this correlator can be obtained by adding the operator @xmath66 to the ( refined ) gribov - zwanziger action by coupling it to a source @xmath67 . in this fashion",
    ", we obtain the correlator as follows , @xmath68_{q=0 } & = & \\braket { \\frac{f^2(x)}{4 } \\frac{f^2(y)}{4}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath69 the generator of connected green functions . in @xcite",
    "we have studied the glueball operator in the standard yang - mills theory , supplemented with the landau gauge fixing .",
    "the framework we have set up for pure yang - mills theories , can be now extended to the more complex case of the gribov - zwanziger action , which is our current goal .",
    "+   + unfortunately , simply adding @xmath70 to the action turns out to be too naive . in @xcite",
    ", we have seen that the 4 dimensional operator @xmath70 mixes with other 4 dimensional operators in @xmath0 , in agreement with the general theory concerning the renormalization of gauge invariant operators @xcite .",
    "+   + obviously , we also expect a similar mixing in the gribov - zwanziger framework .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , we can distinguish between 3 different classes of dimension 4 operators .",
    "the first class @xmath71 is the set of the gauge invariant operators , for example @xmath70 .",
    "the cohomology of the nilpotent brst symmetry generator @xmath42 allows to identify the @xmath71 operators @xmath72 as those which can be written as @xmath73 , but also @xmath74 .",
    "the second class @xmath75 are the brst exact operators , which are trivially brst invariant due to the nilpotency of the brst operator .",
    "thus @xmath76 if and only if @xmath77 .",
    "the third class @xmath78 contains operators which vanish when the equations of motion are invoked .",
    "one can then argue that the mixing matrix of these operators must be upper triangular , @xmath79 this particular behavior of the mixing of the various class of operators can be easily understood @xcite .",
    "bare @xmath75 operators can not receive contributions from gauge invariant @xmath71 operators : matrix elements of a bare brst exact operator @xmath80 between physical states are zero .",
    "but , if there would be a renormalized gauge invariant @xmath71 contribution in the expansion of @xmath80 , then there would be room for a nonvanishing contribution , which is of course a contradiction .",
    "likewise , any @xmath78 operator vanishes upon using the equations of motion , while @xmath71- and a @xmath75 operators in general do not , hence a @xmath78 operator will not receive corrections from the other type of operators .",
    "+   + in @xcite , we have strictly proven in an algebraic fashion the upper triangular form of the mixing matrix for the operator @xmath70 , just by using the ward identities of the action .",
    "in particular , we have proven that the following action is renormalizable for ordinary yang - mills gauge theories in the landau gauge , @xmath81 whereby we see the three different classes of operators arising . we have introduced three new sources : the doublet ( @xmath82,@xmath83 ) with @xmath84 and the color singlet @xmath85 .",
    "the term @xmath86 is indeed an element belonging to the second class @xmath75 , as we can rewrite it as @xmath87 . in @xcite",
    ", we have introduced the last term through a shift of the gluon field @xmath88 .      with the mixing of the 4 dimensional operators in mind",
    ", we can propose an enlarged gribov - zwanziger action containing the glueball operator @xmath1 .",
    "this action will turn out to be renormalizable . for this , we can make two observations .",
    "firstly , the limit , @xmath89 , has to lead to our original yang - mills action @xmath90 with the addition of the glueball terms given by equation .",
    "secondly , setting all the terms related to the glueball term @xmath91 equal to zero , we should recover the gribov - zwanziger action @xmath92 in equation .",

    "notice that in principle , we could have taken other possible starting actions which also enjoy these two correct limits .",
    "we could have tried to couple different sources to the different brst exact terms instead of employing only one source @xmath83 . however",
    ", this would not lead to a renormalizable action , while the action does turn out to be renormalizable , as we shall prove .",
    "+   + we shall now try to establish the renormalizability of by using the algebraic renormalization formalism @xcite .",
    "+   + the first step is to introduce two auxiliary terms necessary for the process of renormalization .",
    "firstly , we add an additional external term @xmath96 to the action , @xmath97 which is needed to define the nonlinear brst transformations of the gauge field @xmath98 and of the ghost field @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath101 are two new brst invariant sources which shall be set equal to zero in the end , @xmath102 therefore , these sources can be seen as two auxiliary sources which do not change the physics of the theory .",
    "secondly , we also introduce the following external term , @xmath103 whereby @xmath104 is a new doublet of sources , i.e.  @xmath105 .",
    "this additional term is necessary in order to have a sufficient powerful set of ward identities . without this term ,",
    "two ward identities of the original gribov - zwanziger action would be broken which are absolutely indispensable for the proof a the renormalization of the action ( see ward identity 8 . and 9 . in the list below ) .",

    "all the other relations stay valid of course .",
    "as the final step of our analysis , we shall try to determine a renormalization group invariant operator which contains @xmath364 .",
    "this is useful as we would want to obtain a renormalization group invariant estimate for the the glueball mass , i.e.  the pole of the corresponding correlator .",
    "this analysis is completely similar to the one presented in @xcite , due to the fact that the mixing matrix @xmath2 is exactly the same .",
    "however , for the benefit of the reader , let us repeat the analysis .",
    "we define the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath38 of the mixing matrix @xmath2 as @xmath365 with the following derivatives , @xmath366 we obtain @xmath367 notice that this anomalous dimension matrix is finite , as it should be .",
    "this matrix @xmath38 is related to the anomalous dimension of the operators , since @xmath368 with @xmath369 we now have all the ingredients at our disposal to determine a renormalization group invariant operator .",
    "we set @xmath370 with @xmath371 , @xmath372 and @xmath373 functions of @xmath289 , to be chosen in such a way that @xmath374 hence @xmath375 we therefore choose @xmath376 and we conclude that @xmath377 is a renormalization group invariant scalar operator containing @xmath70 , in the case of the gribov - zwanziger action @xmath92 as well as in the case of the refined action @xmath259 .",
    "as we have found a renormalization group invariant , the final goal @xcite shall be that of evaluating the glueball correlator @xmath378 using the ( refined ) gribov - zwanziger action .",
    "however , this is beyond the scope of the present article as this calculation shall be far from trivial , even at lowest order .",
    "+   + as usual the equation of motion terms like @xmath14 will not play a role .",
    "let us demonstrate this with a simple example , @xmath379 \\mathcal f(x )   a_\\mu^a ( y ) \\frac{\\delta s_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{rgz } } } } } { \\delta a_\\mu^a ( y ) } { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-s_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{rgz } } } } } ~=~   - \\int [ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\phi ] \\mathcal f(x ) a_\\mu^a ( y ) \\frac{\\delta   { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-s_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{rgz } } } } } } { \\delta a_\\mu^a ( y ) }   \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int [ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\phi ]    { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-s_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{rgz } } } } }   \\frac{\\delta   \\left ( a_\\mu^a ( y ) \\mathcal f(x ) \\right ) } { \\delta a_\\mu^a ( y ) }   ~=~ \\ldots \\delta(x - y ) + \\delta(0 ) \\braket{\\mathcal f(x)}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is zero as @xmath380 and @xmath381 in dimensional regularization .",
    "therefore , expression reduces to , @xmath382",
    "in this paper , we have scrutinized the glueball operator @xmath383 using the ( refined ) gribov - zwanziger action @xmath8 ( @xmath272 ) . for this , we have followed the framework of an earlier work @xcite where we have investigated this operator for the more simple case of the usual yang - mills gauge theory , quantized in the landau gauge . however , this framework is heavily based on the existence of the brst symmetry while neither @xmath8 nor @xmath272 are brst invariant @xcite .",
    "therefore , throughout the paper , we have relied on the extended model @xmath92 and @xmath259 . with these `` enlarged '' actions",
    ", one can then draw very similar conclusions as in the ordinary yang - mills case .",
    "the results of interest , i.e. those for the ( refined ) gribov - zwanziger action , then easily follow from these extended models in the physical limit , in which case certain external sources are assigned a suitable value .",
    "+   + firstly , the classically gauge invariant operator @xmath1 mixes with two other operators , a brst exact operator , @xmath384 $ ] , and an operator proportional to the gluon equation of motion , @xmath385 . by using the algebraic renormalization procedure ,",
    "we have determined the form of the mixing matrix @xmath2 to all orders , @xmath386 which has an upper triangular form , as required @xcite .",
    "+   + in a second part of the paper , we have completely fixed all the elements of this mixing matrix , by using only algebraic arguments .",
    "we have found @xmath387 which is completely analogous as in the case of the ordinary yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "this is already a remarkable fact .",
    "in addition , we have also encountered numerous checks on our results as we have recovered multiple known relations between the anomalous dimensions of all the fields and sources .",
    "+   + in the final part , we have determined a renormalization group invariant including @xmath1 , given by @xmath388 which is the main result of this paper . this operator would then be a good point to start the study of the ( lightest ) scalar glueball from , by means of the correlator @xmath389 @xcite .",
    "+   + in standard yang - mills gauge theories , gauge invariant operators @xmath390 only mix with brst exact and equation of motion type terms . while the latter always yield trivial information at the level of correlators , the brst exact pieces drop out due to the brst invariance of the gauge invariant operator @xmath390 and of the vacuum . in the gribov - zwanziger approach , the situation gets more complicated due to the breaking of the brst symmetry . at present",
    ", it is however unclear if and how such a nonlocal symmetry , nilpotent @xcite or not @xcite , can be used to define physical operators . ] . in the physical limit , @xmath254 is no longer a brst invariant operator .",
    "in addition , the brst symmetry is softly broken .",
    "therefore , when turning to physical states , @xmath254 will no longer be irrelevant , and explicitly influence the value of the correlator .",
    "this is not the only observation we can make .",
    "@xmath391 is not the only renormalization group invariant of dimension 4 . indeed ,",
    "also the operator @xmath392 does not run with the scale , as we directly infer from equations and .",
    "we can therefore imagine to study correlators of linear combinations of the operators @xmath393 and @xmath394 , where the linear combination is chosen in such a way that the emerging pole structure would be real .",
    "we notice that this is not a trivial issue in the gribov - zwanziger framework @xcite , basically due to the fact that the poles of the gluon propagator itself are already not necessarily real - valued .",
    "when the gribov parameter @xmath12 is formally set back to zero , we shall recover the correlators of the usual kind in yang - mills gauge theories , as the brst symmetry gets restored , as well as the brst exactness of the operator @xmath80 .",
    "+   + a research project along the previous lines would thus be very interesting to pursue .",
    "it would also enable us to show that the soft brst breaking , deeply related to the presence of the gribov horizon , is not necessarily a negative feature of the theory .",
    "rather , it could be very helpful in the construction of suitable operators @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the results in this paper have to be seen as a first step towards the construction of ( hopefully ) physical correlators in the gz theory . as it should have become clear from this paper , an important tool has been the possibility of embedding the ( r)gz theory into the extended model .",
    "the nilpotent exact brst symmetry of the latter model can be used to identify the renormalizable operators by using cohomological techniques , which then also give the renormalizable operators in the physical limit .",
    "these latter operators will contain the classically gauge invariant operators . at the same time ,",
    "also renormalizable brst exact operators can be found , which reduce to renormalizable operators in the physical limit , being not necessarily brst exact .",
    "it then remains to be seen whether suitable linear combinations of these two types of operators can be found that successfully describe physical correlators .",
    "this will be the topic of future work . as there are multiple mass scales present in the ( refined ) gribov - zwanziger framework",
