    "be stars  defined as b - type stars showing or having showed emission lines instead of absorption lines in the balmer spectrum @xcite  are known to produce an infrared ( ir ) flux which is higher than predicted by kurucz stellar atmosphere models @xcite .",
    "it has long been speculated that be stars possess an extended circumstellar envelope or disc ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and optical interferometry observations confirm the presence of an extended circumstellar envelope which is symmetrical around the rotation axis ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these circumstellar discs act as reverse accretion discs as they are regions ( confined to a disc structure ) of increased stellar outflow .",
    "the free - free and free - bound emission which occurs in the disc is presumably responsible for the observed ir excess .",
    "these discs also show great variability and grow and shrink over periods of hundreds to thousands of days . for a review of classical be stars , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "an important be x - ray pulsar binary ( be - xpb ) example is the tev gamma - ray system psr  b1259 - 63  which consists of a 48  ms pulsar in orbit around a be star , ss  2883 , and was initially detected as part of a radio survey of the southern galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the orbit is eccentric ( @xmath1 ) and unpulsed tev gamma - ray emission has been detected by hess close to the periastron passage @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar disc is mis - aligned to the orbital plane and the pulsar is believed to pass through it twice : before and after periastron .",
    "previous observations have also detected unpulsed radio emission near periastron ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) and the system has been observed at x - ray frequencies across the whole orbit ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations show that the unpulsed emission is variable at all wavelengths with respect to the orbital period .",
    "the system is powered by the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar and the unpulsed radiation is believed to originate from a stand - off shock front between the pulsar and stellar wind ; extensive modelling has been presented in @xcite . in this model",
    "the x - rays are produced via synchrotron radiation of ultra - relativistic electrons ( lorentz factor @xmath2 ) and the gamma - ray emission through the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of target photons from the be star .",
    "the ratio between the x - ray and gamma - ray flux is dependent on the radiative and adiabatic cooling times of the post - shocked wind and ic cooling was predicted to increase near periastron .",
    "ic cooling of the pre - shocked wind was also suggested by @xcite .    a slower wind model has also been proposed @xcite where the pulsar wind has a lorentz factor of @xmath3 and up - scatters the target photons from the be star via ic processes to x - ray energies .",
    "the tev gamma - rays are then explained via the interaction of the pulsar with the circumstellar disc and are the result of proton - proton collisions , ic scattering and bremsstrahlung emission @xcite .",
    "if the tev gamma - rays are the result of ic scattering of target photons from the be star , this implies that electron energies are of the order of tev and the observed tev gamma - rays are the result of scattering which occurred in the klein ",
    "nishina limit .",
    "while previous models have considered ic scattering in the general case , there are currently only tev gamma - ray observations of psr  b1259 - 63  and the emphasis has been to model the tev emission which will occur in the klein  nishina limit .",
    "previous models have not considered how the scattering of the ir excess from the circumstellar disc , occurring in the thomson limit , will influence the gamma - ray production .",
    "it can be shown ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that ic scattering between a relativistic electron with a lorentz factor @xmath4 and a photon with a frequency @xmath5 will occur in the classical thomson limit if @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent planck s constant , the electron mass and the speed of light respectively .",
    "to explain the results of previous hess observations of psr  b1259 - 63 , @xcite proposed that electrons are accelerated in the shock between the pulsar ( @xmath10 ) and stellar wind , resulting in the ic scattering of stellar photons .",
    "this scattering will occur in the thomson limit for target photons with frequency @xmath11  hz , i.e. radio to ir .",
    "the ir excess provides an additional reservoir of soft target photons for ic scattering and an attractive framework to explain gamma - ray production through ic scattering in the thomson limit , where the cross - section is significantly higher than the klein ",
    "nishina limit .",
    "a more detailed discussion , especially focussing on the ic spectral properties , will be presented in section  [ ic ] .",
    "since the ir excess is tied to the growth and decay of the circumstellar disc , the size of the disc near periastron will influence gamma - ray production not only through the constraints on the plerion shock , but also through ic scattering in the thomson limit .",
    "this study will discuss the effect of the ir excess on ic gamma - ray production in be - xpbs using psr  b1259 - 63  as a trial case .",
    "results of modelling the full ic scattering spectrum ( thomson and klein  nishina limit ) of an isotropic distribution of photons and electrons will be presented here as an initial argument towards the importance of the contribution of the ir excess .",
    "the additional effects of the different electron cooling processes in the plerion shock front and the changing scattering angle , due to orbital motion , will not be discussed at this time as the goal of this paper is to validate the importance of the ir excess on ic gamma - ray production . in order to include the ir",
    "excess the target photon distribution will be determined using the curve of growth method proposed by @xcite ( referred to hereafter as the cog method ) fitted to previous optical and ir observations .    an outline of previous observations and studies of psr  b1259 - 63  will be presented ( section  [ psrb ] ) before discussing the cog method ( section  [ be - stars ] ) and ic scattering ( section  [ ic ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : modelling ] will outline the modelling undertaken in this study and sections  [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] will discuss the results and implications thereof .",
    "while this paper focuses only on one aspect of the the multiwavelength emission from psr  b1259 - 63 , a complete model needs to take into account all wavelengths to accurately explain the radiative processes in the system . below a brief summary",
    "is given of previous observations and modelling of the system which is relevant to the discussion presented in this paper .",
    "there have been few photometric observations of ss  2883 , the optical companion to psr  b1259 - 63 , but some measurements are available in bright star catalogues ( table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "for example , @xcite presented photometric and visual extinction measurements for ss  2883 as part of their catalogue of ob stars near the southern coalsack .",
    "comparison of the catalogue s observations show little change in the optical magnitude . from this and other observations",
    "@xcite confined the spectral range of ss  2883 to a o9 - b2 type star and assumed a spectral type b2e , with @xmath12  m@xmath13 and @xmath14  r@xmath15 .",
    "@xcite also undertook spectroscopic observations of the system and observed double peak h@xmath16 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath17 and he  i  5876 emission lines .",
    "analysis showed that the h@xmath16 emission occurred at a radius of @xmath18 , assuming a keplerian circumstellar disc , which infers a circumstellar disc radius @xmath19 .",
    "there are also few observations in the mid  to  near ir , but observations are available from the _ 2mass _ @xcite and _ _ msx _",
    "_ @xcite missions .",
    "the ir data is shown in table  [ tab : tab2 ] . due to the large uncertainty in the c - band measurement",
    "it was not considered when modelling this system .",
    "in addition to the pulsed radio signal , an unpulsed radio signal has been detected from the system close to periastron ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observations of the system during consecutive periastron passages show an eclipse of the pulsar  and a decrease in the unpulsed synchrotron emission ",
    "roughly 20 days before and after periastron passage as it passes through and behind the circumstellar disc .",
    "for example , the pulsar eclipse lasted from 16 days before until 18 days after periastron during the 2000 passage @xcite and from 15.8 days before until 16.1 days after periastron during the 2004 passage @xcite . at @xmath20  days from periastron",
    "the binary separation is @xmath21 , assuming @xmath22 , which implies that the circumstellar disc must at least extend to these distances .",
    "while the synchrotron radio observations show many similarities there are marked differences in the flux levels during consecutive periastron passages , attributed to variations in the circumstellar disc and material ( see e.g. fig .  3 and discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "for the case of the broad electron energy distribution ( @xmath26 ) the gamma - ray spectrum is dominated by electrons with lorentz factors @xmath27 scattering photons from the peak of the stellar spectrum .",
    "this scattering will occur in the thomson limit and produce gamma - rays with energies @xmath28 as a result , the major contribution at gev energies is from the thomson scattering of the whole stellar spectrum and the resulting gamma - ray spectrum is negligibly affected by the ir excess , as is shown in fig .",

    "a disc radius of @xmath32 is assumed for all cases . ]",
    "since it is known that the circumstellar discs around be stars are variable over periods of hundreds to thousands of days , the resulting change in the ir flux should also create variability in the gev gamma - ray emission from psr  b1259 - 63 .",
    "a simple prediction can be made to show how the changing ir excess will modify the gamma - ray emission for psr  b1259 - 63 . by changing the disc radius parameter in the cog method ( while keeping the other parameters constant i.e.  @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) the magnitude of the ir excess can be simulated for different size circumstellar discs in psr  b1259 - 63 .",

    "the modelling above assumes that the circumstellar disc only influences the photon distribution at ir wavelengths .",
    "however , it is known that the circumstellar disc also increases the magnitude of be stars at optical wavelengths .",
    "this will greatly increase the total number of target photons and may result in an even greater possible variability of the gamma - ray flux during consecutive periastron passages .",
    "an increase in the be star s flux at optical wavelengths could also lead to variability in the case of the broad electron distribution ( @xmath26 ) as an increase in the flux near the peak of the stellar spectrum will lead to an increase in the total gamma - ray flux .",
    "the increase in the gamma - ray flux due to the inclusion of the ir excess in an isotropic approximation will not be observable with current gamma - ray telescopes .",
    "if the modelled fluxes are compared to the hess spectrum the modified flux will fall below the _ fermi _ detection threshold .",
    "a larger broad electron spectrum with more electrons around @xmath37 may produce a gamma - ray spectrum large enough to be be detected by _",
    "fermi _ , but the variability due to the ir excess reported here would not be observable .",
    "the analysis discussed here does however assume only isotropic scattering and the geometric size of the disc has not been considered .",
    "anisotropic modelling of the system may show a more pronounced effect , especially close to periastron where the circumstellar disc not only provides an ir excess but scattering will occur over the larger solid angle of the disc .",
    "psr  b1259 - 63  is a particularly important gamma - ray binary system since it contains an independently confirmed 48  ms pulsar compact object ( as opposed to ls  5039 and ls  i  + 61@xmath38303 where the nature of the compact object must be inferred ) and the gamma - ray emission is most likely created through the ic scattering of target photons from the optical companion via the electrons / positrons emanating from the pulsar wind .",
    "previous modelling of the ic gamma - ray emission has not taken into account the ir excess created by the circumstellar disc and how these additional target photons will influence the ic scattering .    in this paper",
    "the @xcite cog method was fitted to ss  2883 using optical , near - ir and mid - ir data available in literature and archives , under the assumption that the circumstellar disc has a radius of @xmath39 , and that the be star is a main sequence star with the parameters @xmath40  k , @xmath41 , @xmath12  m@xmath13 and @xmath14  r@xmath15 based on the least squares fit performed in this paper and @xcite .",
    "the fit was used to calculate the target photon number density which was in turn used to calculate the ic spectrum for psr  b1259 - 63 . for a first approximation only isotropic scattering",
    "was considered in order to demonstrate the relevance of the ir excess .",
    "the modelling shows that the ir excess has a non - trivial influence on the ic spectrum , particularly at gev energy gamma - rays where the flux increases by a factor @xmath0 for reasonable electron distributions .",
    "it has also been shown ( since the circumstellar disc is variable ) how changes in the ir excess will manifest as variability at gamma - ray energies .",
    "consequently , observations of consecutive periastron passages may show differences in the gev gamma - ray light curve as a result of a possibly changing ir excess .",
    "the results presented above have implications for other be - xpbs and gamma - ray binary systems .",
    "previous modelling of the ic spectrum only considered a blackbody or mono - energy distribution for the target photons , however , the results above show that the ir excess from the circumstellar disc will have a non - trivial influence on the ic gamma - ray spectrum that must be accounted for when modelling psr  b1259 - 63 .",
