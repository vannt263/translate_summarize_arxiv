    "since the critical point symmetries @xcite of the nuclear shape phase transitions were proposed , many experimental and theoretical efforts were made to find the nuclei described by the new symmetries . while at the beginning the x(5 )",
    "@xcite candidates were found in the mass region of @xmath3 @xcite , recently a new region has been suggested for os and pt isotopes with @xmath4 @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite data for the isotopes @xmath5os were analyzed with the sextic and spheroidal approach ( ssa ) @xcite , the davidson and spheroidal approach ( dsa ) @xcite , the infinite square well and spheroidal approach ( iswsa ) @xcite and the results were compared with those of the coherent state model ( csm ) @xcite and x(5 ) . according to our analysis these isotopes present features for the @xmath6 shape phase transition with the critical point reached for @xmath7os and @xmath8os .",
    "on the other hand , applying the sextic and mathieu approach ( sma ) @xcite to @xmath9os , one points out that the isotope @xmath10os is a good candidate for the critical point of the phase transition between the prolate and the oblate shapes through the triaxial shape corresponding to @xmath11 .    encouraged by the results for the os isotopes , we consider the above mentioned models also for the even - even @xmath2pt isotopes .",
    "we aim not only at determining the energy spectra and the electric transition probabilities but also at showing the static deformation of each isotope in both the ground and excited states .",
    "new features like the shape coexistence or a transition from the prolate to oblate shapes through a triaxial deformation are expected to show up . keeping in mind that the sma , the iswma and the z(5 ) @xcite are suitable for the description of the triaxial nuclei lying close to @xmath11 , a comparison of their predictions represent a challenging task .",
    "iswma is the inedited model proposed of this paper .",
    "recently , in ref . @xcite it was shown that the isotope @xmath12pt has some of the x(5 ) features . according to the interacting boson model-1 ( ibm-1 ) @xcite and the general collective model @xcite , this isotope manifests shape coexistence and it is close to the critical point of the @xmath6 shape phase transition . evidences for shape coexistence",
    "were also presented for @xmath13pt @xcite , @xmath14pt @xcite , @xmath15pt @xcite and @xmath8pt @xcite , which suggests that this behavior is a specific feature for pt isotopes .",

    "we advise the reader to consult refs .",

    "moreover , the x(5 ) failure in explaining the data from the @xmath0 band is removed by ssa , and that happens especially for @xmath12pt . concerning the @xmath1 band , all three formalisms , ssa , iswsa and x(5 ) , encounter difficulties in explaining the band head energy .",

    "an explanation for this picture could be that x(5 ) and z(5 ) use only the zero order approximation of the harmonic part of the transition operator ( [ transop ] ) . indeed ,",
    "as shown in table [ tab-5 ] , for @xmath79pt the results obtained by ssa and iswsa using only the harmonic transition operator are almost identical with those of x(5 ) .",
    "by contrast for @xmath82pt where the anharmonic contributions were included , the results of ssa and iswsa are better than those of x(5 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the r.m.s .",
    "associated to z(5 ) for @xmath10pt and @xmath83pt are smaller than those provided by iswma .",
    "this situation might be caused by the fact the two approached considered for the @xmath1 band different descriptions .",
    "indeed , in the framework of z(5 ) the states of @xmath1 band are characterized by @xmath84 , while the iswma @xmath1 states have @xmath85 .",
    "[ tab-5 ]    [ tab-6 ]    in table vii we list the results for branching ratios of few states from the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands obtained by ssa , iswsa , sma and iswma approaches , respectively .",

    "for @xmath86pt we list also the results yielded by the z(5 ) formalism .",
    "the parameters determining the transition operator were fixed as follows . for @xmath8pt and @xmath87pt",
    "we kept @xmath88 as given in tables iii and iv respectively , while @xmath89 was fixed by a least square procedure .",
    "the results for @xmath89 are also listed in table vii . as for the rest of isotopes from the mentioned table , the parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 are as listed in tables iii ,",
    "another objective of the present work is to determine the isotope shape in ground and excited states , within both the ssa and the sma .",
    "indeed , it is interesting to see how the shape changes when one passes from one isotope to another and moreover whether this picture is state dependent.we expect to visualize the shape phase transition and also possible shape coexistence .",
    "the static shape is defined by the values of the intrinsic variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 for which the probability density ( the probability in the volume unit of @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 reaches a maximum value . in fig.1 ,",
    "the contour plots are represented in the coordinates @xmath92 . in order to save the space we chose two representatives for ssa , @xmath79pt and @xmath8pt , and one for sma , @xmath87pt .",
    "indeed , the graphs corresponding to @xmath93pt are similar to that of @xmath79pt and those of @xmath94pt resemble that of @xmath87pt .",
    "we may ask ourself why to make such plots once we know that the power expansion in @xmath1 was performed around @xmath95 and @xmath96 we notice that the density maxima are met not in the same point where the potential is minimum .",
    "the reason is that the density accounts also for the kinetic energy and moreover includes a factor defining the measure of the integration in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 coordinates .",
    "these figures reflect the structure of the wave functions . indeed , since the @xmath1 dependent function depends on @xmath97 and the spheroidal functions are symmetric with respect to the space reflection transformation , the graphs exhibit the symmetry @xmath98 . concerning sma",
    "the mentioned symmetry is caused by the fact the potential in @xmath1 is function of @xmath99 .",
    "also , the node of the @xmath0 function causes a doublet maxima with the same @xmath1 . for @xmath8pt",
    "we notice equal density curves which surround two maxima of identical beta .",
    "this situation is specific to the shape coexistence .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such transition is showing up despite the fact that for all isotopes @xmath100pt we used a power expansion in @xmath1 around @xmath101 .",
    "that means that the transition is caused not only by the potential shape but also by the structure coefficients involved in the associated differential equations . actually , we calculated the spectroscopic properties of pt isotopes with @xmath102 also with a power expansion in @xmath1 around @xmath103 .",
    "however , the results of sma are characterized by a smaller r.m.s values for the deviations of the predictions from the experimental data . it is interesting to note that although we changed the description when we passed from @xmath8pt to @xmath87pt the probability density undergoes a smooth transition .",
    "the maxima surrounded by equidensity curves merge in one maximum at @xmath104 for ground and @xmath0 band states , while for @xmath1 band states the doublets are well separated .",
    "how this picture is modified when additional degrees of freedom like octupole @xcite or single particle @xcite will be analyzed elsewhere .",
    "note that for @xmath87pt the considered excited state in the @xmath0 band is @xmath105 and not @xmath106 as happens for other isotopes .",
    "the reason is that , as seen from table v , the highest spin state for which energies in nuclei with @xmath107 , calculated with sma , is @xmath105 .    ,",
    "@xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath80 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 of @xmath114pt and @xmath87pt , calculated with ssa and sma , respectively .",

    "exceptions are @xmath115 for @xmath8pt and @xmath116 for @xmath87pt , where the steps are 12 and 25 , respectively . , width=529,height=793 ]",
    "in the previous section we described some even - even isotopes of pt by four solvable models emerging from the generalized bohr mottelson hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , for the isotopes with @xmath117 the approaches are those abbreviated by ssa and iswsa , respectively , while for the rest of nuclei , @xmath118 , the sma and iswma are alternatively used .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the approach called iswma was used for the first time in the present paper .",
    "since the first set exhibits some features of the x(5 ) `` symmetry '' we compared the results of our calculations with those obtained with the x(5 ) formalism , if they are available .",
    "as for the other isotopes the results were compared with the z(5 ) results .",
    "one concludes that our results are slightly better than those obtained with x(5 ) and z(5 ) methods regarding both the excitation energies and reduced e2 transition probabilities .    the wave function structure is nicely reflected in the contour plots for the probability density .",
    "it is suggested that due to the hamiltonian symmetries the wave functions might be suitable for accounting for shape evolution as well as for possible shape coexistence ."
