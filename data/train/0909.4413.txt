    "euler s 3-body problem is a soluble special case of the general 3-body problem , in which a test particle moves in the gravitational field of two gravitational sources - point masses - which are fixed in space .",
    "it is liouville integrable since , besides the energy and one component of the angular momentum , there is a third constant of the motion ( see e.g. @xcite ; see @xcite for a hyperbolic space version of the problem which is still integrable ) .",
    "a natural relativistic generalisation of this problem is to consider the motion of test particles in a weyl solution describing two schwarzschild black holes , which are kept in equilibrium due to a strut in between them . for this problem",
    "there is no known analogue to euler s constant ( see @xcite for a discussion about this point ) ; equivalently , there is no known separability for the geodesic equations .",
    "generic geodesics have , therefore , to be studied numerically . for",
    "the special case in which the two black holes have equal mass , there is , however , a 1 + 2 dimensional totally geodesic sub - manifold in which geodesics are liouville integrable .",
    "in particular it is straightforward to derive all circular causal orbits .",
    "regular ( on and outside an event horizon ) static black holes in vacuum general relativity do not admit causal circular geodesics below a certain critical radius , which lies outside the event horizon . below this radius ,",
    "the angular momentum term in the radial equation of motion , usually centrifugal ( with respect to the black hole ) , becomes centripetal , making equilibrium impossible .",
    "this change in character of the angular momentum term has a geometric interpretation in terms of optical geometry @xcite : define  outwards \" as the direction in which fixed points sets of the optical geometry s isometry group ( spheres ) increase their proper size ; then , the angular momentum term is always  outwards \" .",
    "similar considerations may be made about stationary black holes .",
    "however , in this case the optical geometry is a randers - finsler rather than riemannian geometry , making the interpretation more subtle @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the optical geometry of the aforementioned relativistic euler s 3-body problem is richer than the standard one of the schwarzschild black hole . to be concrete let the two black holes in the weyl solution considered have equal mass @xmath2 and separation @xmath3 between them .",
    "this choice of masses implies that there is a discrete @xmath0 symmetry of the solution .",
    "the set of fixed points of this discrete symmetry is a totally geodesic sub - manifold , @xmath11 .",
    "the optical geometry of this sub - manifold then has the following feature : for sufficiently small but non - zero @xmath9 the notion of  outwards `` , defined as above , changes continuously twice , rather than just once .",
    "this means that , on @xmath11 , there is an annulus - like region in which ' ' outwards \" means a decreasing radial weyl canonical coordinate .",
    "the boundaries of this annular region are the loci of two circular photon orbits , and the region itself is a forbidden band for time - like circular geodesics , which are allowed everywhere outside this band . as @xmath9 increases , the two boundaries of the annular region approach one another and coalesce when @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the golden ratio ! for larger @xmath9 , @xmath11 admits no circular photon orbits and time - like circular geodesics are allowed everywhere , just as in the @xmath0 symmetric euler s 3-body problem .",
    "considering a weyl solution with an array of @xmath10 , rather than two , black holes along a line , still possessing a @xmath0 discrete symmetry , leads to two cases . for @xmath10 even ( odd ) , we essentially recover the optical geometry of the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) case .",
    "we shall also consider charged black holes in einstein - maxwell theory , by using a solution generating technique @xcite that allows the introduction of a charge parameter in weyl solutions .",
    "for black holes , the charge parameter is the ratio of charge to mass , which is the same for all the black holes in the solution . in this case , as we increase the charge for fixed @xmath14 , the proper area of the forbidden band increases ; for @xmath15 , this area diverges as we reach extremality , as a consequence of the infinite ` throat ' developed by extremal black holes . keeping the charge and @xmath2 fixed ,",
    "the area of the forbidden band decreases as @xmath9 is increased , just as for the uncharged case , becoming zero at some maximum value of @xmath9 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "after a brief discussion of the newtonian euler s 3-body problem in section 2 , we describe in section 3.1 the weyl solutions that shall be used in the relativistic version of the problem , as well as the circular null and time - like orbits . in section 3.2",
    "the charged case is considered . in section 4",
    "the interpretation of the forbidden band for time - like circular orbits is given in terms of optical geometry .",
    "in section 5 we briefly discuss the case of multiple black holes .",
    "we close with some final remarks .",
    "in euler s 3-body problem , a.k.a . the two - centre kepler problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , with both masses equal to @xmath16 , the motion of a test particle moving in the symmetry plane between the two masses obeys ( ) ^2=2e - v ( )  , v()=-  , [ radequ ] where @xmath17 is a radial cylindrical coordinate , @xmath18 are the energy and angular momentum per unit mass and @xmath9 is the distance from either mass to the symmetry plane .",

    "let us remark that , as a newtonian problem , the passage from point particles to two equal rods , aligned with the direction of separation , does not alter the previous conclusion : in the symmetry plane , circular orbits still exist at any radial distance from the symmetry axis .",
