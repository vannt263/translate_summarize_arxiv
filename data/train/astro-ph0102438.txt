    "the nearby ( distance of 7.2@xmath150.3 mpc , herrnstein et al . 1999 ) , bright ( @xmath16 ) , sabbc galaxy ngc4258 ( m106 ) is spectroscopically classified as a 1.9 seyfert galaxy ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 , who find [ oiii]/h@xmath17=10.3 , and [ sii]/h@xmath18=0.94 ) . wilkes et al . ( 1995 ) find relatively broad ( 1000 km s@xmath1 ) emission lines , which are strongly polarized ( 5 - 10% ) , supporting the existence of an obscured active nucleus in this galaxy .",
    "further support to this case comes from high resolution observations of the water maser in the galaxy nucleus .",
    "miyoshi et al . ( 1995 ) discovered a highly inclined thin disk between 0.13 and 0.25 pc .",
    "the inclination of the disk is estimated to 82@xmath151 degrees ( herrnstein et al . 1999 , the inclination of the galaxy is 70 degrees , ho et al .",
    "the aspect ratio of the disk is extremely small , @xmath19 ( herrnstein et al .",
    "the keplerian rotation curve traced by the water maser requires a central binding mass , presumably in the form of a supermassive black hole , of @xmath20 m@xmath21 ( herrnstein et al .",
    "1999 ) . to date , this is the strongest evidence for a supermassive black hole in a galaxy and the best measurement of its mass . the implied eddington luminosity is @xmath22 erg s@xmath1 . pending an accurate estimate of the observed nuclear luminosity , it is therefore possible in this case to constrain tightly the @xmath23 ratio of the active nucleus .    the evaluation of the nuclear luminosity and spectrum is not an easy task because the nucleus is highly obscured .",
    "wilkes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) discovered a faint , blue , highly polarized nuclear continuum , but the uncertainty on the optical nuclear luminosity is large ( two orders of magnitude , depending on the nature of the scattering region ) .",
    "similar uncertainties are found using the intensity of the emission lines .",
    "chary & becklin ( 1997 ) found a `` nuclear '' emission at 2 micron , in excess of that expected from the galaxy profile , of 4.5 mjy , corresponding to a luminosity ( @xmath24 ) of about @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the nucleus is not detected in vlba radio maps .",
    "herrnstein et al .",
    "( 1998 ) report upper limits to the 22 ghz flux and luminosity of 0.22 mjy and @xmath25 erg s@xmath1 respectively .",
    "conversely , a double , twisted radio jet is visible on scales from milliarcsec to a few arcmin ( the latter scale corresponding to a few kiloparsec at the galaxy distance ) .",
    "the jets are visible in optical and x - ray images too .",
    "in particular , cecil , wilson & de pree ( 1995 ) resolved the jets in rosat hri observations and measured a 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosity of @xmath26 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "they also detected an unresolved `` nuclear '' emission of comparable luminosity , confirming previous einstein results ( fabbiano et al .",
    "asca spectra ( makishima et al . 1994 , ptak et al . 1999 , reynolds et al .",
    "2000 ) resolve at least two distinct components , a thermal component dominating the spectrum up to 2 - 3 kev and a highly absorbed power law dominating the spectrum above this energy .",
    "the asca power law energy index is @xmath27 and the neutral absorbing column is in the range @xmath28 @xmath5 ( see reynolds et al .",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev flux observed by asca varied between @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( reynolds et al . 2000 ) , ( 6 - 15)@xmath31 , when corrected for intrinsic absorption , during several observations performed between may 1993 and may 1999 .",
    "this implies a 2 - 10 nuclear luminosity in the range @xmath32 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainties on the spectral index and absorbing column are quite large ( 0.20.3 and @xmath33 @xmath5 respectively ) , due to the fact that only a narrow energy band is unaffected by the bright thermal component , and so is the uncertainty on the unobscured flux .",
    "reynolds et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also report the detection of a narrow 6.4 kev iron k@xmath18 line of equivalent width of @xmath34 ev .",
    "because of the small luminosity in terms of the eddington one , the nuclear emission of ngc4258 can be explained either by a standard accretion disk with a very small accretion rate , or by radiatively inefficient accretion models , such as the advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf , e.g. narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "the radio to x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) has been interpreted in terms of emission from an adaf with a critical accretion rate @xmath35 ( lasota et al , 1996 ; @xmath36 is the viscosity parameter in units of 0.1 ) or @xmath37 ( gammie et al .",
    "1999 , their modeling also includes the nir data and the 22 ghz upper limit ) . in adaf models",
    "the radio luminosity comes from synchrotron emission and the x - ray comes from the combined contributions of a high temperature ( kt@xmath38100 kev ) thermal bremsstrahlung and comptonization of the synchrotron photons .",
    "lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) point out that this representation is not unique , because of the substantial uncertainties in the optical - uv and x - ray data and because of the difficulty in distinguishing an adaf from thermal comptonization , using only the x - ray spectral shape .",
    "both lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and gammie et al .",
    "( 1999 ) do not account in their models for the strong wind expected from the inner accretion disk ( blandford & begelman 1999 , di matteo et al .",
    "the wind carries a significant fraction of the mass , energy and angular momentum .",
    "in particular , it drastically reduces the synchrotron emission in the radio band and the compton emission in the o - uv and x - ray bands ( di matteo et al .",
    "2000 ) . in both modelings",
    "the nir luminosity is generated by a standard , geometrically thin disk , external to the adaf transition radius .",
    "bepposax , with its good sensitivity over a broad ( 0.1 - 200 kev ) band , can help in separating the different x - ray spectral components and can provide a strong constraint on the nuclear power law spectral index and on the high energy cut - off ( predicted by both adaf models and thermal comptonization models ) .",
    "it can help understanding whether the ngc4258 nucleus hosts a `` normal '' agn ( although of low luminsity ) or rather an adaf .",
    "bepposax observed ngc4258 for about 100 ks on december 19 - 22 1998 .",
    "the nuclear component was in a high state in comparison with most asca observations .",
    "this , together with the broad band ( the source is detected with a signal to noise ratio @xmath39 up to about 70 kev ) allows us to tightly constrain the flux and spectral shape of the nuclear hard component .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the data and gives information on their reduction ; section 3 presents a variability analysis ; section 4 presents the spectral analysis and the broad band , radio to x - ray spectral indices ; section 5 discusses the main results on the hard nuclear component and on the low energy components .",
    "the observations were performed with the bepposax narrow field instruments , lecs ( 0.1 - 10 kev , parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) , mecs ( 1.3 - 10 kev , boella et al .",
    "1997b ) , hpgspc ( 4 - 60 kev , manzo et al . 1997 ) and pds ( 13 - 200 kev , frontera et al .",
    "lecs and mecs are imaging gas scintillation proportional counters , the hpgspc is a collimated high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter and the pds consists of four phoswich units .",
    "the pds is operated in the so called `` rocking mode '' , with a pair of units pointing to the source while the other pair monitor the background @xmath40 arcmin away .",
    "the units on and off source are interchanged every 96 seconds .",
    "we report here the analysis of the lecs , mecs and pds data ; the hpgspc data are very noisy , due to high hpgspc background .",
    "the mecs observations were performed with units 2 and 3 ( on 1997 may 6@xmath41 a technical failure caused the switch off of unit mecs1 ) ; these data were combined together after gain equalization .",
    "the lecs is operated during dark time only , therefore lecs exposure times are usually smaller than mecs ones ( a factor of 3 for ngc4258 ) .",
    "table 1 gives the lecs , mecs and pds exposure times and the count rates .",
    "standard data reduction was performed using the saxdas software package version 2.0 following fiore , guainazzi and grandi ( 1999 ) . in particular ,",
    "data are linearized and cleaned from earth occultation periods ( we accumulated data for earth elevation angles @xmath42 degrees ) and unwanted periods of high particle background ( satellite passages through the south atlantic anomaly and periods with magnetic cut - off rigidity @xmath43 gev / c ) .",
    "the internal background of the lecs , mecs and pds during the accepted periods is relatively low and stable ( variations at most of 30% during the orbit ) due to the low inclination of the satellite orbit ( 3.95 degrees ) .",
    "lecs and mecs spectra were extracted from regions of 8 arcmin and 3 arcmin radii respectively .",
    "these radii maximize the signal - to - noise ratio below 1 kev in the lecs and above 2 kev in the mecs .",
    "background spectra were extracted in detector coordinates from high galactic latitude ` blank ' fields ( 98_11 issue ) using regions equal in size to the source extraction region .",
    "we have checked that the mean level of the background in the lecs and mecs `` blank fields '' observations is comparable with the mean level of the background in the ngc4258 observations using source free regions at various positions in the detectors .",
    "the pds data have been reduced using the variable risetime threshold technique to reject particle background ( see fiore , guainazzi & grandi 1999 ) .",
    "this technique reduces the total 13 - 200 kev background to about 20 counts s@xmath1 and the 13 - 80 kev background to about 6 counts s@xmath1 ( instead of 30 and 10 counts s@xmath1 respectively , obtained using the standard fixed risetime threshold technique ) .",
    "the pds rocking mode provides a very reliable background subtraction .",
    "this can be checked looking at the spectrum between 200 and 300 kev , where the effective area of the pds to x - ray photons is small and therefore the source contribution is negligible ; we obtain after background subtraction 0.0085@xmath150.012 counts s@xmath1 , consistent with the expected value of 0 .",
    "the net ( background subtracted ) 13 - 130 kev on - source signal is 0.121@xmath150.024 counts s@xmath1 .",
    "the source is detected with a signal to noise ratio @xmath6 up to @xmath44 kev .",
    "the 13 - 130 kev pds count rate is @xmath45 times the systematic uncertainty in the pds background subtraction , equal to 0.020@xmath150.015 , ( guainazzi & matteuzzi 1997 ) . confusion in the pds collimator field of view ( 1.4 degrees fwhm ) ultimately limits our capability to constrain the high energy spectrum .",
    "we have carefully checked for any possible contaminant in a region of 1.5 degrees radius around ngc4258 ( using the ned , simbad , agn , clusters , cvs , radio and x - ray sources catalogs ) finding no obvious bright hard x - ray source .",
    "of course there is the possibility of a bright `` unknown '' source in the pds field of view .",
    "the chance of finding a source in any given 2  square degrees , the pds beam area , is however small .",
    "the heao-1 a4 all sky catalog ( levine et al .",
    "1984 ) lists just 7 high galactic latitude sources in the 13 - 80  kev band down to a flux of 2@xmath4610@xmath47 ( 10mcrab ) .",
    "the 13 - 80 kev flux is about 20 times smaller than this figure and so , assuming a logn - logs slope of @xmath481.5 , we expect a chance coincidence rate of 2% .",

    "the spectral indices of the obscured and unobscured power laws are linked together      to study the low energy spectrum of ngc4258 we now include in the spectral fitting the mecs data in the full 1.7 - 10 kev band and the lecs spectrum , which covers the 0.1 - 4 kev band .",
    "the lecs , mecs and pds data were fitted with an optically thin thermal plasma model ( mekal ) plus the nuclear absorbed power law component and an iron k@xmath18 line .",
    "an additional absorbing column of density fixed to the galactic value along the line of sight ( @xmath54 @xmath5 ) has been included in the fit .",
    "the best fit power law spectral index and intrinsic absorption resulted very close to the best fit values found in the previous section . in table 3",
    "we give only the parameters of the low energy component .",
    "the fit with a single thermal component is not completely satisfactory ( see figure [ lecs_spe1 ] , upper panel ) , with rather large residuals between 0.5 and 1 kev .",
    "the lecs and mecs spectra have therefore been fitted with a two temperature model plus the highly absorbed power law and the iron k@xmath18 line ( figure [ lecs_spe1 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the improvement in @xmath55 is significant ( @xmath56 for three additional parameters , corresponding to a probability of 99.98% , according to the f test , see table 3 ) .",
    "while the temperature of the cooler component is well constrained , for the hotter component we obtain only a lower limit of about 1.3 kev .",
    "the metal abundance of the cooler component is constrained to be higher than 0.2 solar , while that of the hot component is constrained to be smaller than 0.9 solar .",
    "the results on the other parameters do not change fixing the metal abundances to the solar value .",
    "the 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosities of the cool and hot components are about 10 and 7 @xmath57 erg s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev luminosity of the hot component is @xmath58 erg s@xmath1 . because of the complexity of the model and of the limited energy resolution of the lecs and the mecs the uncertainties on these values are however rather large , the order of 50% .",
    "a slightly better fit is obtained by replacing the thermal `` hot '' component with an unobscured power law . in this case",
    "the improvement in @xmath55 is significant at the 99.998% confidence level ( @xmath59 for two additional parameters ) .",
    "fixing the spectral index of the unobscured power law to that of the obscured nuclear component ( so mimicking a partial covering model ) produces a @xmath55 of 89.6 , still acceptable .",
    "the covering fraction is in this case @xmath60 .",
    "the bepposax 2 - 10 kev flux is about 2 times higher than in the may 1993 and may 1999 asca observations , while it is similar to that in the 1996 observations ( reynolds et al .",
    "the power law index is consistent with the asca measurements .",

    "the luminosity of the `` cool '' and `` hot '' components are slightly higher than in the rosat pspc and hri observations and in the asca observations , if taken at the face value , but the uncertainties in both the bepposax data on these luminosities are rather large ( 30 to 50% ) .",
    "the energy and equivalent width of the iron line are consistent with the asca determination .      as said in the introduction the sed of ngc4258",
    "was compared with broad band adaf models by lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and gammie et al .",
    "the fit of detailed adaf models to the radio to x - ray sed is beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we limit ourselves to consider the two broad band spectral ratios @xmath65= l(22ghz)/l(5kev ) and @xmath66=l(@xmath67)/l(5kev ) , plotted in figure [ rxirx ] .",
    "the ngc4258 bepposax and asca data have been combined with the herrnstein et al .",
    "( 1998 ) 22 ghz upper limit and with the chary & becklin ( 1997 ) @xmath67 `` nuclear '' emission .",
    "the resulting ratios are compared with the analogous ratios built from the di matteo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) best fit adaf + wind models to the seds of six nearby elliptical galaxies ; and with the ratios computed from the average seds of uvx selected radio quiet quasars ( elvis et al . 1994 ) . from figure [ rxirx ]",
    "we note that the ngc4258 points are in the region occupied by radio quiet agn ; and that the @xmath65 and @xmath66 values are 2 - 4 orders of magnitude lower and higher , respectively , than in adaf plus wind best fit models .",
    "the nuclear luminosity l(2 - 10 kev ) of ngc4258 during the bepposax observation was about @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 , similar to the nir @xmath67 luminosity estimated by chary & becklin ( 1997 ) .",
    "this is consistent with an extrapolation of the x - ray power law down to a few microns . on the high energy side ,",
    "the bepposax data are not able to provide a strong constraint on the cut - off . however , bepposax measured a cut - off energy of 100 - 200 kev in half a dozen seyfert galaxies ( matt 2000 and references therein ; see also zdziarski et al . 2000 , and references therein , for gro / osse results ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the nuclear power law component can be extrapolated up to @xmath68 kev .",
    "if this is the case the 3 micron to 200 kev total nuclear luminosity is of the order of @xmath69 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty on this number strongly depends on the assumed nir to x - ray spectral index ( an uncertainty of 0.2 on this spectral index would imply a @xmath70 uncertainty on the total luminosity ) .",
    "the nuclear nir to x - ray luminosity is similar to the minimum _ bolometric _ luminosity implied by the wilkes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) detection of polarized flux . a nuclear nir to x - ray luminosity of @xmath69 erg s@xmath1 and a black hole mass of @xmath20 m@xmath21 ( herrnstein et al .",

    "although higher than the eddington ratios estimated by lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and gammie et al .",
    "( 1999 ) this is still in the adaf regime ( e.g. narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore discuss briefly in the following the applicability of adaf models to the nuclear emission of ngc4258 .",
    "the sed of adaf models depends on a variety of parameters and assumptions ( narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 , quataert & narayan 1999 , di matteo et al .",
    "2000 ) . here",
    "we distinguish between two main families of models , ( a ) those in which strong winds efficiently deplete the emission region of emitting electrons and reduce the synchrotron radio emission together with the inverse compton emission in x - rays ( e.g. di matteo et al 2000 ) , and ( b ) those without winds .",
    "the observed 2.5 - 70 kev spectral index ( @xmath7 ) is steeper than what expected in adaf models where the contribution of comptonization is negligible and the x - ray luminosity is mostly due to thermal bremsstrahlung with kt=100 - 200 kev , i.e. @xmath72 at energies below 50 - 100 kev ( case ( a ) , see e.g. di matteo et al .",
    "an additional kt@xmath73 kev bremsstrahlung component can contribute for at most one third of the broad band x - ray luminosity of the main ( @xmath74 ) power law component ( see sect .",
    "on the other hand , if the x - ray band is dominated by comptonization , case ( b ) , the observed x - ray spectral index can be easily explained . in this case",
    "we would expect either strong synchrotron emission in the radio band , or strong infrared emission from the outer thin disk , to provide enough soft photons for the inverse compton scattering .",
    "we discuss these two possibilities in turn .      given the x - ray luminosity observed by asca and the higher one observed by bepposax , the herrnstein et al .",
    "( 1998 ) 22ghz upper limit is barely consistent with the gammie et al .",
    "( 1999 ) adaf models without wind .",
    "furthermore , the observed radio - to - x - ray luminosity ratio is 23 orders of magnitude lower than in nearby elliptical galaxies supposed to host an adaf ( see figure [ rxirx ] and sect .",
    "adaf solutions with or without winds seem more `` radio - loud '' than the ngc4258 nucleus .",
    "conversely , the radio - to - x - ray luminosity ratio is consistent with that found in radio - quiet agns ( elvis et al .",
    "we also note that the 22ghz upper limit is consistent with the luminosity of a radio jet , whose power is proportional to the optical luminosity of a standard accretion disc ( as inferred from the optical emission lines , falcke & biermann 1999 ) .",
    "the nir to x - ray ratio of ngc4258 is also similar to that of radio - quiet agns ( see figure [ rxirx ] ) , while it is higher than in the di matteo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) adaf models with winds by 2 - 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact , gammie et al .",
    "( 1999 ) associate the strong nuclear nir luminosity detected by chary & becklin ( 1997 ) to emission from a thin disc extending down to 5 - 50 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "according to gammie et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the flow should become advection dominated and produce a geometrically thick configuration at this transition radius .",
    "the size of the x - ray emission region and therefore the putative transition radius can be constrained through x - ray variability studies .",
    "there are at least two relevant timescales here , the local dynamical timescale @xmath76 and the causality timescale @xmath77 .",
    "large variations on timescales of @xmath78 seconds are present in the 3 - 10 kev light curve of ngc4258 , as well as 10 - 20% variations on shorther ( @xmath79 hour ) timescales . associating the longer timescales to @xmath80 ,",
    "as expected if the hard x - ray luminosity is mostly due to bremsstrahlung emission , produces an emission radius in units of @xmath81 of @xmath82 . associating the same timescale to @xmath83 produces @xmath84 .",
    "these radii are still consistent with the adaf transition radius of @xmath85 suggested by gammie et al .",
    "we note however , that even if a transition radius as small as @xmath86 may be mathematically correct , it is less than two times the last stable orbit in a schwarzschild metric . since the transition between a geometrically thin disk to a thick configuration is unlikely to be very sharp , this leaves little space for the putative hot plasma region responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "reynolds et al . ( 2000 ) suggest that the size of the nuclear x - ray source may be as large as @xmath87 , based on the limit on the width of the iron k@xmath18 line .",
    "however , a sizeable fraction of the line emission may well be produced by outer gas , as for example the gas responsible for the x - ray absorption , see sect .",
    "4.1 .    in conclusion , adaf models with strong winds can be ruled out for the nuclear emission of ngc4258 , based on both the measured x - ray spectral shape and the x - ray variability .",
    "adaf models without strong winds may be applicable but it is not clear if they are a viable physical solution ( blandford & begelman 1999 , di matteo et al .",
    "moreover , they imply a radio to x - ray ratio barely consistent with the measured upper limit , and also for them the x - ray observed variability constrains the transition radius to be rather small ( between @xmath88 and 100 @xmath81 ) .",
    "the ir - to - x - ray eddington ratio , the x - ray variability and spectral shape , and the radio - to - x - ray and nir - to - x - ray luminosity ratios suggest that the nucleus of ngc4258 is an agn in a low state ( see e.g. siemiginowska et al .",
    "1996 ) or a scaled - down version of a seyfert nucleus .",
    "this is also consistent with the conclusions of neufeld & maloney ( 1995 ) who suggest that the low luminosity of ngc4258 is the result of low accretion rate ( @xmath89 ) . in the model of neufeld & maloney ( 1995 )",
    "the radiative efficieny is high , @xmath90 , in contrast to the low efficiency adaf models .",
    "the x - ray nuclear luminosity can be naturally explained in terms of comptonization of soft photons in a hot corona ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 , haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "witt et al . ( 1997 ) developed a model of accretion disc plus corona introducing a coupling between the energy dissipated in the corona and the accretion rate .",
    "they found that if the viscosity mechanisms are the same in the disc and in the corona , the corona does not form for accretion rates smaller than a critical value , because compton cooling wins against viscous heating in the corona .",
    "this critical value is @xmath91 at small radii and increases with the radius . under this condition ,",
    "if the eddington ratio of 0.0002 is linearly proportional to @xmath92 and if the efficiency in the conversion of accretion power into radiation is @xmath93 , a corona should not form in the nucleus of ngc4258 .",
    "there are at least two ways out from this problem .",
    "the first is that the efficiency @xmath94 is at least as small as 0.01 .",
    "this may be the case if a large part of the accretion power is carried out by a different channel , for example kinetic energy in a wind ( as also foreseen in the witt et al .",
    "second , the dissipation of accretion power and the viscosity mechanisms may be very different in the disc and in the corona , as in the case of local magnetic reconnection flares in the corona , envisaged by haardt , maraschi & ghisellini ( 1994 ) .",
    "more theoretical work is clearly needed to understand if accretion rates as small as 0.0002 in eddington units may power a low luminosity version of a normal seyfert galaxy nucleus , although this already seems for ngc4258 the most likely and less demanding , in terms of complexity , scenario .",

    "one component must be thermal , given the strong iron l complex detected , and its best fit temperature is kt@xmath96 kev .",
    "it can be due to shocks formed in the interaction of the jet with the interstellar matter ( cecil et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the shape of the second component is not well constrained by the bepposax data .",
    "it is consistent with both thermal emission with temperature of kt@xmath97 kev or a power law with energy index @xmath98 .",
    "this component may consist of a fraction of 0.935@xmath99 of the nuclear power law spilling out from a non uniform absorber .",
    "ngc4258 is known to be highly polarized ( wilkes etal 1995 ) .",
    "this implies that there are lines of sight to the nucleus scattering photons towards us and providing an unobscured view .",
    "such geometry mimicks a partial covering of the nuclear continuum .",
    "the observed covering fraction of is consistent with the 510 polarization observed in this source ( wilkes etal 1995 ) .",
    "alternatively , the second component may be due to integrated emission from binaries and supernova remnants .",
    "the contribution from these discrete sources may be estimated from the b band luminosity of ngc4258 ( trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 , canizares , trinchieri & fabbiano 1987 , fabbiano et al .",
    "the total b magnitude , corrected for extinction , is b=8.53 ( de vaucouleurs et al 1991 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity in the b band , in units of the solar luminosity , of log@xmath100=10.49 .",
    "the fabbiano et al .",
    "( 1992 ) relationship between @xmath101 and @xmath100 for normal spiral galaxies implies a 0.2 - 4 kev luminosity of @xmath102 erg s@xmath1 from discrete sources , which is @xmath103 the measured `` hot '' component 0.2 - 4 kev luminosity . since the scatter in the fabbiano et al .",
    "( 1992 ) correlation is a factor of three we can not exclude that the entire observed `` hot '' component is due to discrete x - ray sources in the host galaxy .",
    "high spatial resolution observations , like those allowed by the superior telescopes on board the chandra satellite , will be able to resolve the discrete sources in the galaxy and therefore measure or put strong limits to any truly diffuse `` hot '' component .",
    "the nuclear continuum of ngc4258 varies on a timescale of half a day ( see sect .",
    "3 ) . our data are not good enough to detect fe - k line variability",
    ". however , all the observations to date are consistent with fe like flux being constant over at least few times 10@xmath104 seconds .",
    "we also find that the flux of the fe line is consistent with its origin in the absorbing gas ( sect .",
    "all this places the fe line , and so the absorber at a distance of @xmath105 cm .",
    "the water maser emission in ngc4258 originates at 0.13 pc from the nucleus .",
    "thus the location of the x - ray absorber is consistent with being the same as that of the maser emission .",
    "such an association between the x - ray absorber and maser emission is further corroborated by a general tendency of maser sources to show strong x - ray absorption , see for example ngc4945 circinus galaxy , ngc1068 ( matt .",
    "et al . 2000 and references therein ) , eso103-g35 ( wilkes et al . 2001 ) and possibly ngc3079 ( bassani et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in the models of neufeld & maloney ( 1995 ) for maser emission in ngc4258 ,",
    "the x - rays from the nuclear agn are shielded by gas of large column density . such shielding helps creating the layer of warm molecular gas in the midplane of the circumnuclear disk .",
    "the column density of the shielding gas in the neufeld & maloney ( 1995 ) model is @xmath106 @xmath5 , exacly what we measure in the present bepposax observation .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the large column density gas responsible for the nuclear x - ray absorption is also shielding the molecular gas .",
    "neufeld & maloney ( 1995 ) also note that if the circumnuclear disk is absolutely flat , i.e. not warped , then it would not be illuminated by the x - ray continuum .",
    "in this situation the temperature in the midplane of the disk would be too cold to excite water maser emission .",
    "note that in such a geometry there would not be any x - ray absorption either .",
    "all the above facts point towards a direct causal link between strong x - ray absorption and water maser emission .",
    "illumination by x - ray continuum and subsequent shielding by a large column density gas seems to be required for maser emission , at least in some models .",
    "if such a scenario is correct , then every maser emitting agn would show absoption in its x - ray spectrum .",
    "we would like to thank the bepposax hardware teams for the development and calibration of the instruments .",
    "in particular , we would like to remember the late daniele dal fiume for his continuous dedication and his fundamental contribution to an instrument of unprecedented sensitivity and robustness like the bepposax pds .",
    "this research has made use of saxdas linearized and cleaned event files ( rev.2.0 ) produced at the bepposax science data center .",
