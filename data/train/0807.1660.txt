    "constraints on the phase diagram of qcd under extreme conditions of high excitation ( temperature ) and compression ( density ) are of vital interest for large - scale experimental programmes with ultrarelativistic heavy - ion beams , searching for signatures of the qcd phase transitions : chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement .    under conditions of finite temperature @xmath6 and small chemical potentials @xmath7 , which are probed in heavy ion collisions at sps , rhic and in the near future at lhc , lattice qcd simulations have provided insight into the phase structure since the temperature - dependent change of the order parameters of the above phases , namely the chiral condensate @xmath8 and the traced polyakov loop @xmath9 , have been determined  @xcite .",
    "the peak positions of the susceptibilities derived from these calculations for both transitions are remarkably coincident at the same pseudocritical temperature @xmath10 .",
    "this might be understood in terms of general effective theory  @xcite .",
    "it is also remarkable that these results can be nicely described with an effective model of the njl type , extended with the inclusion of a coupling to the polyakov loop @xcite with a potential @xmath11 that can be extracted from lattice qcd simulations of the pressure in the pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the challenge for experiments as well as for theory is to extend this knowledge into the domain of finite baryon densities , where precursors of color superconductivity ( pseudogap phase  @xcite ) or even color superconducting quark matter phases themselves can occur  @xcite and new constraints from observations of compact star properties may apply @xcite .    most of the effective model analyses addressing the chiral phase transition in the qcd phase diagram have been performed with njl type models which , however , lack quark confinement and lead to an onset of finite quark densities already at unphysically low temperatures of about 50 mev @xcite , far below the deconfinement temperature of about 200 mev @xcite .",
    "the straightforward step to implement the effects of confining forces and to suppress unphysical quark degrees of freedom is to study the phase diagram of quark matter in the polyakov loop njl ( pnjl ) model .",
    "this has been carried out , e.g. , in refs .",

    "@xcite . in that paper , however , only the high - density region for a quark chemical potential @xmath12  mev has been considered , and light quark masses have been neglected .",
    "it has been found that the polyakov - loop formulation together with neutrality constraints can give rise to an increase of the critical temperature for the color superconductivity transition , in deviation from the well - known bcs relationship .",
    "an investigation of the interrelation between chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath1sb ) and color superconductivity , as well as a study of the effect of color neutrality without enforcing electric neutrality , is still missing .",

    "[ fig4 ] , the presence of diquark condensation leads to a reduction of the expectation value of the traced polyakov loop @xmath9 and thus enforce the confining aspects of the model .",
    "it is important to point out that the presence of a nonvanishing polyakov loop variable @xmath5 breaks the color su(3 ) symmetry down to su(2 ) , so that the rotational invariance for the choice of the orientation of the 2sc gap under color neutrality constraints @xcite might be lost . as a consequence , the above ansatz for @xmath71 may not correspond to the true minimum of the thermodynamical potential which instead might point to a different direction in the @xmath42 space @xcite .",
    "while accounting for such a disorientation of the 2sc condensate may lead to quantitative corrections , we believe that the qualitative structure of the phase diagram for the pnjl model under color neutrality constraints shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "the 2sc phase might coexist with chiral symmetry breaking and confinement in the temperature range between about 50 mev and 100 mev at densities below the onset of chiral restoration with possible observable consequences in heavy - ion collision experiments , e.g. , due to diquark - antidiquark annihilation into lepton pairs @xcite .",
    "note that with the coexistence of @xmath1sb and 2sc phases the condition for bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of diquark bound states is fulfilled and the chiral restoration transition in the above temperature window may therefore be characterized as a bec - bcs crossover transition where the diquark bound states undergo a mott effect to unbound , but resonant diquark cooper pairs @xcite",
    "in this paper we have explored the consequences of imposing the color neutrality constraint within the framework of the standard mean field treatment of the pnjl model at finite chemical potential .",
    "we have found that the fulfillment of such a constraint leads to some changes in the phase diagram of the model , as e.g.  a shrinking of the @xmath1sb domain in the @xmath2 plane and a shift of the end point to lower temperatures .",
    "the most noticeable effect turns out to be the presence of a coexistence region of @xmath1sb and 2sc phases , which may have consequences for possible applications of the model in heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "the effects can be understood due to the nonvanishing color chemical potential @xmath3 , which is introduced to compensate the color charge @xmath4 induced by the color background field @xmath5 . for a given baryochemical potential @xmath7 , @xmath146 reduces the chemical potential of blue quarks , while simultaneously increasing that of red and green ones .",
    "the net effect is a shift of the @xmath1sb phase border to lower @xmath7 values than without the color neutrality constraint , due to the nonlinear dependence of the quark mass gap on the chemical potential close to its critical value for a given , not too low temperature .",
    "it is seen that this effect is relatively slight , taking into account the theoretical uncertainty that can be in general expected from an effective quark model .",
    "in addition , the increase of chemical potentials of red and green quarks , which pair in the 2sc channel , entails an effective lowering of the critical value of @xmath147 for the onset of the 2sc phase , again for not too low temperatures .",
    "one finds in this way a @xmath1sb-2sc coexisting phase , whose size depends on the value of the parameter @xmath129 that drives the quark - quark interaction .",
    "we notice that the 2sc border has been obtained after choosing a given ansatz for the mean field values @xmath71 .",
    "the actual orientation of the 2sc gap in color space under the presence of the polyakov loop is a subject that deserves further study .",
    "moreover , it is worth to point out that at finite densities there is no fundamental need to be restricted to lorentz invariant condensates , thus more general mean field configurations could be considered .",
    "signatures of the coexisting @xmath1sb and 2sc phases might become apparent in not too energetic heavy - ion collision experiments ( about 3 - 5 gev / nucleon ) , as they are possible at the future facilities fair - cbm ( darmstadt ) , nica - mpd ( dubna ) and j - parc ( japan ) .",
    "such a mixed phase can give rise , e.g. , to an enhancement of low - mass dilepton production due to diquark - antidiquark annihilation .",
    "it is a realization of the bec - bcs crossover in quark matter .",
    "while such a transition has previously been discussed in the njl model by artificially increasing the diquark coupling to large values  @xcite , which can result in conflicts with the nuclear matter ground state , in the present pnjl model the @xmath1sb-2sc coexisting phase has been obtained without any artificial tuning of parameters .",
    "it just occurs as a consequence of color neutrality in a domain of temperatures and chemical potentials around the critical end point of the first order chiral phase transitions for the standard fierz - value of the diquark coupling , @xmath141 , without affecting the nuclear matter ground state at @xmath89 .",
    "finally , it has been shown that the coexistence of confinement and chiral symmetry restoration characterizing a quarkyonic phase in the pnjl model at finite densities and low temperatures gets even reinforced due to color superconductivity .",
    "the occurrence of diquark condensation reduces the expectation value of the traced polyakov loop and thus acts towards strengthening the confinement aspect of the model .",

    "<S> the phase diagram of a two - flavor polyakov loop nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio model is analyzed imposing the constraint of color charge neutrality . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect of this constraint is a coexistence of the chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath1sb ) and two - flavor superconducting phases . </S>",
    "<S> additional effects are a shrinking of the @xmath1sb domain in the @xmath2 plane and a shift of the end point to lower temperatures , but their quantitative importance is shadowed by the intrinsic uncertainties of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the effects can be understood in view of the presence of a nonvanishing color chemical potential @xmath3 , which is introduced to compensate the color charge density @xmath4 induced by a background color gauge mean field @xmath5 . at low temperatures and large chemical potentials the model exhibits a quarkyonic phase , which gets additional support from the diquark condensation . </S>"
