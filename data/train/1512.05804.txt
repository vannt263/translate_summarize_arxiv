    "research into 5d transition metal compounds has blossomed in recent years due to the potential for new electronic and magnetic phenomena to emerge from the interplay between crystal field effects , electronic correlations ( hubbard u ) and strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",

    "j _  =  @xmath7 electronic state in the presence of strong soc @xcite .",
    "further , iridates are known to crystallize in numerous structure types , each with unique ir - ir connectivity , and this fact has made them an active area of study@xcite . in aggregate ,",
    "recent literature on the magnetic and electronic properties of iridates are unified by a desire to probe the influence of strong soc and u on electronic behavior@xcite .",
    "based honeycombs , in particular the _ a_@xmath1iro@xmath0 ( _ a _",
    "=  li / na ) family , have fallen under intense scrutiny following predictions that they might host a spin - liquid ground state@xcite .",
    "efforts to produce new iridium oxide honeycomb lattices have intensified@xcite , but 4d and 5d materials containing continuous honeycomb connectivity remain scarce .    here",
    "we report the synthesis and characterization of two new honeycomb iridates based on ir@xmath8 ( 5d@xmath5 ) .",
    "the first , nairo@xmath0  is produced via  _ chimie douce _ oxidative deintercalation of sodium from na@xmath1iro@xmath0 , which preserves the planar honeycomb network of edge - sharing iro@xmath3 octahedra .",
    "the second , sr@xmath0cair@xmath1o@xmath2 , is a 2:1 ordered perovskite , which shares its structure with sr@xmath0caru@xmath1o@xmath2@xcite , and consists of layers of iro@xmath3 octahedra forming a buckled honeycomb lattice .",
    "magnetic susceptibility data collected on both compounds demonstrate weak temperature - independent magnetism , and resistivity measurements show semiconducting behavior consistent with hopping conductivity .",
    "these compounds are thus ideal to investigate the interplay between non - cubic crystal fields and soc . by comparison with related 4d and 5d honeycomb compounds with",
    "partially filled t@xmath9 subshells , we find that d electron count correlates strongly with the magnetic behavior , and present a thorough structural analysis of sr@xmath0cair@xmath1o@xmath2  and sr@xmath0caru@xmath1o@xmath2  that ultimately suggests the correlation is driven by soc .",
    "nairo@xmath0  was prepared _ via _",
    "the oxidative deintercalation reaction : @xmath10 the 1:1 relationship between oxidant consumption and na@xmath11 deintercalation of equation 1 was confirmed by laboratory x - ray powder diffraction ( xrpd ) data collected on powders after vacuum evaporation of the solvent , which showed crystalline nabr as the only side product . in contrast to the precursor material na@xmath1iro@xmath0  which degrades rapidly in laboratory air@xcite , nairo@xmath0  is stable under ambient conditions , as xrpd data showed no evidence of decomposition after several months of air exposure .",
    "however , nairo@xmath0  degrades rapidly upon heating above 200@xmath12c in air , as evidenced by the broadening of diffraction peaks and appearance of new reflections .",
    "attempts at producing intermediate stoichiometries ( i.e. na@xmath13iro@xmath0 ) were unsuccessful , and instead produced two - phase samples containing a mixture of na@xmath1iro@xmath0  and nairo@xmath0 .",
    "further , no phase width was observed in nairo@xmath0 , as reactions performed with excess bromine produced only nairo@xmath0  with no observable difference in lattice parameters or physical properties .",
    "the structure of nairo@xmath0  was solved in space group @xmath14 _ via _  rietveld refinement to laboratory xrpd data ( fig .",
    "[ nairo3_rietveld](a ) ) .",
    "final structural parameters are available in the si .",
    "solution of the structure in higher symmetry cells was prevented by the high degree of inter - plane stacking disorder , which arises due to the fact that there are several possible translations that can take place in the honeycomb plane from one layer to another , each of which generates a different stacking pattern at minimal energetic cost .",
    "stacking disorder is a well known structural perturbation in many layered compounds , and evidence of this disorder can be plainly seen in the poorly - fit peak broadening and incorrect intensities present at low diffraction angles .",
    "further evidence of this structural disorder is provided by synchrotron xrpd data ( fig .",
    "[ nairo3_rietveld ] ( a , inset ) ) , which show highly asymmetric @xmath150 0 l@xmath16 peaks  this may occur as a consequence of decomposition in the intense synchrotron beam . using diffax@xcite , we modeled the diffraction patterns for three distinct stacking variants . when viewed from perpendicular to the honeycomb plane ,",
    "these stacking variants can be described based on which atoms in the honeycomb plane eclipse ( sit directly above ) the na ion in the adjacent plane .",
    "the three primary stacking possibilities are : 1 ) na - ir eclipsed ; 2 ) na - na fully eclipsed , which produces infinite na channels ; 3 )  staggered , in which none of the atoms in the honeycomb plane eclipse those in the adjacent plane , which is the pattern adopted by the parent material na@xmath1iro@xmath0 .",
    "the simulated diffraction patterns for these stacking arrangements , along with xrpd data collected on a sample of na@xmath1iro@xmath0  are shown in figure fig .",
    "[ nairo3_rietveld](b ) .",
    "the observed xrpd pattern closely resembles the simulation obtained for the na - ir eclipsed variant , but with noticeable broadening and attenuation of several peaks .",
    "a fourth pattern was simulated based on a model consisting of 95% na - ir eclipsed stacking with a 5% probability of a fully - eclipsed stacking fault .",
    "this model produces a good qualitative agreement with the raw xrpd data , suggesting that the fully eclipsed stacking variant may only be slightly less energetically favorable than the na - ir eclipsed variant .",
    "the presence of the fully eclipsed stacking fault suggests that further synthetic work may yield control over stacking order in this compound .",
    "for an in - depth discussion on stacking disorder in honeycomb iridates , see ref .",
    "this is the second known structure with the formula nairo@xmath0-a post - perovksite structure with the same formula is obtained when synthesized under high - pressure and temperature @xcite .",
    "neither structural polymorph of nairo@xmath0  can be synthesized using conventional solid - state techniques , a fact that underscores the novelty and relative instability of the ir@xmath4 oxidation state .",
    "the structure of sr@xmath0cair@xmath1o@xmath2  was solved in space group _ p_2@xmath17/_c _ ( 14 ) _ via _  rietveld refinement to neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) and xrpd data ( fig .",

    "while the structure of sr@xmath0cair@xmath1o@xmath2  may seem odd given the apparent wealth of other barium - based compounds with analogous stoichiometry , it is actually unsurprising that a conventional perovskite lattice is formed in this case due to the improved match in ionic radii between sr and ir . the same is true of sr@xmath0caru@xmath1o@xmath2 , which also has a similar collection of ba - based 6h - perovskite - type cousins .",
    "while many different perovskites containing iridium have been reported in addition to the widely studied sr@xmath1iro@xmath20 , this seems to be a rare example of an iridium - based perovskite containing honeycomb connectivity .",
    "furthermore , the corner - sharing bonding motif of the honeycomb lattice is the first of its kind in iridates , and thus opens a new avenue along which to search for new honeycomb materials that are free from stacking disorder and are air  stable .",
    "the corefinement of the sr@xmath0cair@xmath1o@xmath2  structure to both xrpd and npd data yielded stable oxygen positions that can be used to investigate the honeycomb connectivity in detail ( fig .",

    "1.92(4 )  , respectively ) .",
    "these non - uniform exchange interactions result in an effective dimerization between ir sites even though the distances between adjacent iridium sites on the honeycomb lattice are remarkably similar .",
