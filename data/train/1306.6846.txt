    "heavy - ion fusion below the coulomb barrier presents the opportunity to study the quantum tunneling of many - body systems  @xcite . for relatively light systems ( @xmath4 , the fusion probability below the barrier",
    "can be described well using the single barrier penetration model ( bpm )  @xcite . however , for heavier systems dramatic enhancements beyond the bpm were observed in the fusion probability below the barrier  @xcite .",
    "this was discovered to be associated with the coupling of additional degrees of freedom , such as vibrational and rotational excitations , which modify the single coulomb barrier producing a distribution of barriers  @xcite .",
    "coupled - channel calculations provide a powerful tool to calculate the fusion excitation functions with the inclusion of couplings to inelastic excitations and/or rotational bands  @xcite .",
    "while nucleon transfer has been considered a `` doorway '' to heavy - ion fusion  @xcite , the coupling of transfer channels to the sub - barrier fusion process is not fully understood  @xcite .",
    "a variety of experimental measurements have shown strong correlations between the presence of positive q - value neutron transfer ( pqnt ) channels and enhanced sub - barrier fusion probabilities ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , the fusion of the symmetric @xmath1ca+@xmath1ca and @xmath5ca+@xmath5ca systems show very similar excitation functions when taking into account the differences in the barrier height and nuclear radii . however , the fusion probability is over an order of magnitude greater for the cross system , @xmath1ca+@xmath5ca , at @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the coulomb barrier )  @xcite .",
    "the most significant difference of the cross system compared to the symmetric systems is the presence of pqnt channels , which suggests that the enhanced sub - barrier fusion is related to the coupling to transfer channels .",
    "in contrast , we previously examined the fusion excitation functions of different sn+ni and te+ni systems , which have large variations in the q - value and number of pqnt channels , and observed no significant enhancement in relation to the pqnt channels  @xcite .",
    "a recent measurement of @xmath8o  +  @xmath9ge fusion by jia _",
    "et al . _ showed a similar lack of enhancement with respect to the presence of pqnt channels  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is unclear why the enhancement from couplings to transfer channels is only present in certain systems .    presently , it is difficult to included transfer couplings in a consistent manner into the coupled - channel calculations  @xcite .",
    "zagrebaev proposed a semi - empirical formulation to account for the coupling of transfer channels with positive q - values which demonstrated reasonable agreement with both fusion excitation functions and neutron transfer cross sections  @xcite . using a quantum diffusion approach , sargsyan _ et al . _",
    "proposed that the fusion enhancement could be attributed to changes in the deformations of the nuclei from nucleon transfer  @xcite .",
    "recently oberacker and umar addressed the issue using a microscopic approach with the density constrained time - dependent hartee - fock ( dc - tdhf ) method and examined the fusion of @xmath10sn  +  @xmath11ca  @xcite .",
    "the dc - tdhf results showed that the enhancement in the fusion of the @xmath12sn  +  @xmath1ca system ( which has many pqnt channels ) was due to a narrower width of the ion - ion potential for that system .",
    "systematic comparisons between different measured fusion excitation functions  @xcite and continued theoretical efforts should help in understanding the mechanism in which transfer channels effect the fusion process . in the present work ,",

    "the setup consisted of two microchannel plate timing detectors ( mcps ) placed upstream from the target that monitored the beam rate and served as a timing references .",

    "the configuration was identical to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the distance between the target and third mcp was increased from 169  mm ( standard configuration  @xcite ) to 329  mm to increase the time of flight ( tof ) path length .",

    "the beam , downscaled by 1000 , was also counted in the ionization chamber allowing for the er cross sections to be calculated . since the energy loss of the beam in the target is about 30  mev , the effective reaction energy was determined by the fitted spline method  @xcite .",
    "the effective reaction energy will be between the initial beam energy ( e@xmath20 ) and the energy after passing through the target ( e@xmath21 ) .",

    "however , fluctuations in the above barrier cross sections of the sn + ca systems , likely due to the difficulty of the rib experiment , create some uncertainty in shift constant .",
    "therefore , it is possible that a larger shift constant could be required which would reduce the enhancement of the @xmath1ca systems .    while the comparison with the sn  +  ca systems indicated an enhancement due to the transfer channel couplings , it is important to examine if couplings to inelastic excitations in the @xmath0te  +  @xmath1ca fusion can reproduce the sub - barrier enhancement .",
