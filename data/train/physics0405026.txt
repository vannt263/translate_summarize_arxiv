    "<S> in this paper , we extend the conventional plane wave expansion method in 3d anisotropic photonic crystal to be able to calculate the complex @xmath0 even if permittivity and permeability are complex numbers or the functions of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> there are some tricks in the derivation process , so we show the process in detail . besides , we also provide an example for testing and explaining , and we also compare the results with the band structure derived from conventional plane wave expansion method , then we finally find that there is a good consistency between them .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the researches of the properties of the photonic crystals ( pcs ) have aroused great interests , since the concept of the pcs has been proposed by yablonovitch and john@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> briefly speaking , pcs are periodically structured electromagnetic media , generally processing photonic band gap ( pbg ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of the studies stress the pbg structures with the use of conventional plane - wave expanded ( pwe ) method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are still many articles explore the influence of interface , such as the studies of transmission , reflection , and the penetration depth etc.@xcite furthermore , the penetration depth relates to the imaginary part of wave vector . as for the complex @xmath2 calculation in 2d isotropic photonic crystals , we had sufficiently discussed about it in the last paper[13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> now , this paper is to continue with the last one . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the emphasis of this paper is put on the general formula , 3d anisotropic case , of extended plane wave expansion ( epwe ) method .    </S>",
    "<S> though the main part of the idea resembles in 2d isotropic case[13 ] , the formula and derivative process are much more complicated than that in 2d isotropic case , because the basis of wave functions can not be treated as scalar functions , te and tm modes in 2d isotropic case . </S>",
    "<S> however , the problem of the difficult part has been overcome and we will explain it in the following description . besides , the eigenfunctions set derived from this epwe method is completely the same as that derived from the conventional pwe method . </S>",
    "<S> so we have no qualms about the inaccuracy of the propagation modes between these two methods .    </S>",
    "<S> the system we discussed is periodically structured without charge @xmath3 and current @xmath4 . therefore , according to maxwell equation , the magnetic field @xmath5 should obey @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the reciprocal lattice vectors , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are the frequency and wave vector , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the tensors of permittivity and permeability of which @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the fourier expansion components , respectively .    </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath0 is provided , eq.(2 ) becomes an eigenvalue problem in which the eigenvalue is @xmath1 and is the conventional pwe method . </S>",
    "<S> now , there comes up an interesting question that is whether @xmath0 must be a vector of which the components are real numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the answer is  no  , and we just need to do some modification on eq.(2 ) to get the complex @xmath0 , because eq.(2 ) is a 4 variables ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) equation .    in the beginning , </S>",
    "<S> two important things need discussing . </S>",
    "<S> first , the inner product of @xmath26 and eq.(2 ) results in @xmath27 which are the restriction functions of which the amount is @xmath28 , meanwhile , @xmath28 is the amount of @xmath29 set . therefore , the certain amount of the independent eigenfunctions in eq.(2 ) is @xmath30 not @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> that s why we will get the fake eigenvalues which are @xmath32 if eq.(2 ) is calculated as an eigenvalue equation directly .    </S>",
    "<S> to avoid this situation occurring in our method , the eigenvector we selected in our method is @xmath33{c}% \\mathbf{h}_{\\mathbf{g}\\perp}\\\\ \\mathbf{\\tilde{h}}_{\\mathbf{g}\\perp}% \\end{array } \\right )   $ ] not @xmath33{c}% </S>",

    "<S> second , there are no @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 in eq.(2a ) , which is the @xmath14 component of eq.(1 ) , because the inner products of eq.(1 ) and @xmath43 will cause the existence of just one @xmath44 or even no , and @xmath45 part will restrict the existence of @xmath46 .    therefore , the treatment of @xmath14 component will be different from @xmath15 and @xmath16 components . </S>",
    "<S> the following is the detail derivation process :    first of all , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 components of eq.(2 ) can be written as a matrix formula@xmath47   \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\mathbf{h}_{\\mathbf{g}}\\\\ \\mathbf{\\tilde{h}}_{\\mathbf{g}}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\mathbf{\\hat{a}}\\left (   k_{x}\\mathbf{\\tilde{h}}_{\\mathbf{g\\perp}% } \\right )   , \\ ] ]    and its expansion type is@xmath48{c}% \\mathbf{h}_{\\mathbf{g}\\perp}\\\\ \\mathbf{\\tilde{h}}_{\\mathbf{g}\\perp}% \\end{array } \\right )   = k_{x}\\mathbf{\\hat{a}}\\left (   \\mathbf{\\tilde{h}}_{\\mathbf{g\\perp}% } \\right )   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath54 matrices and their elements will be illustrated in appendix .    as regards the @xmath14 component of eq.(2 ) , we can write in another form which is different from @xmath15 and @xmath16 components of eq.(2 ) . thus the matrix form of eq.(2a ) </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath60 and their elements are also in appendix .    from eq.(4 ) we obtain    @xmath62    where eq.(5b ) is the production of eq.(5a ) multiplied by @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of eqs.(3 ) and ( 5 ) yields    @xmath63   ^{-1}\\left [   \\left ( \\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_{1}\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_{1}^{-1}\\right )   \\left (   -\\mathbf{\\hat { e}}_{2}\\vdots\\mathbf{\\hat{d}}\\right )   + \\left (   \\mathbf{\\hat{c}}% _ { 1}\\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_{1}^{-1}\\right )   \\left (   \\o\\vdots-\\mathbf{\\hat{e}% } _ { 2}\\right )   + \\left (   \\mathbf{\\hat{b}}_{2}\\vdots\\mathbf{\\hat{c}}_{2}\\right ) \\right ]   \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\mathbf{h}_{\\mathbf{g}\\perp}\\\\ \\mathbf{\\tilde{h}}_{\\mathbf{g}\\perp}% \\end{array } \\right )   \\\\ & \\equiv \\mathbf{\\hat{f}}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\mathbf{h}_{\\mathbf{g}\\perp}\\\\ \\mathbf{\\tilde{h}}_{\\mathbf{g}\\perp}% \\end{array } \\right )   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 is a @xmath65 matrix . considering the equation above with @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> , we finally have an equation @xmath67{c}% \\ ; \\o \\ ; \\vdots \\ ; \\mathbf{i } \\ ; \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> in addition , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath71 zero matrix and identity matrix , alternatively .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 and @xmath73 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice constant , width of square rods and @xmath74 of gaas are @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +    for testing this method , we use an intel centrino 1.4 g , 512 mb ram with matlab code published on mathworks website to run an isotropic simple cubic case in which the gaas square rods  their widths are @xmath76 , and @xmath75 is the lattice constant  cross together from @xmath14,@xmath15 and @xmath16 direction in the vacuum . in this system the permittivity @xmath74 of gaas and vacuum are @xmath78 and @xmath79 , alternatively , and the permeability @xmath80 is @xmath81 everywhere . </S>",
    "<S> you can see its structure in fig.(1 ) and calculation results in fig.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we spent about 6 hours on getting figs.(2b ) and ( 2c ) when using 729 @xmath82 and taking @xmath83 @xmath84 points from @xmath85 to @xmath86 to accomplish the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> as regards fig.(2a ) , it is the band structure which is derived from eq.(2 ) and used to compare with our method . in fig.(2a ) , we can find that @xmath87 is not located in band gap , so such kind of condition should also appeared in our method when we choose the same @xmath1 to plot the contour line or surface . </S>",
    "<S> figure ( 2b ) in which @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath84 scanned from @xmath90 to @xmath86 is the figure of real value solution of @xmath44 derived from eq.(6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when fig.(2a ) compares with fig.(2b ) , we will find out the width of contour in fig.(2b ) equals the width of @xmath91 region in fig.(2a ) .     line . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) and ( c ) are the equal frequency contour line of propagation modes in k space and the @xmath92 vs. @xmath93 figure , alternatively . </S>",
    "<S> the circle in ( b ) denotes the incident light of which @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> both of them are derived from eq.(6 ) when @xmath87 , @xmath94 and @xmath93 is scanned from @xmath90 to @xmath86.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] +    besides , we can find that there are two propagation modes toward right when @xmath84 is a fixed number in fig.(2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these modes are similar to te and tm modes in 2d isotropic pc , however , they can not be distinguished in 3d pc , we just plot them directly . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath95 symmetry exists in fig.(2b ) but not in the figure of real part of complex @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is the real number solutions of @xmath44 are the @xmath44 of the propagation modes which are the solutions of bulk system in which the @xmath95 symmetry exist . </S>",
    "<S> however , the above is not correct when @xmath44 are complex numbers , because the complex means that there is an interface destroying the @xmath95 symmetry and facing @xmath14 direction in the system as well . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , all the evanescent modes of which @xmath44 are complex numbers just exist near the interface and their penetration depths correspond to @xmath96 owing to @xmath97 , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote real and imaginary parts , alternatively . </S>",
    "<S> the most remarkable one of the complex @xmath44 relates to the longest penetration depth denoted as @xmath100 , because almost nothing but the propagation modes can exist in this system when the distance from the detecting position to the interface is larger than @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a semi - infinite system can be treated as two individual regions : surface and bulk regions , all the evanescent modes just exist in the surface region of which the width is @xmath102 definded as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a fixed frequency . for a finite size pc , </S>",
    "<S> if the effect of corner is not important , @xmath102 decides the smallest size of pc . if the size is smaller than the smallest one , the system no longer can be treated as a periodic structured media . </S>",
    "<S> figure(2c ) is the figure of @xmath105 vs. @xmath84 at @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure indicates that the @xmath105 drops to zero quickly when @xmath84 is located at the edge of contour in fig.(2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of situation arises while the state located at the edge of contour changes from propagation mode to evanescent mode . besides , because @xmath106 when the incident light is a propagation mode in vacuum , we can find that @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the longest penetration depth is @xmath108 for all incident light perpendicular to @xmath16 direction .    in conclusion , because eq.(6 ) is a @xmath44 eigenvalue equation when @xmath1 , @xmath84 and @xmath109 are provided , the @xmath1 can be a real number at any time , and @xmath74 and @xmath80 can be the function of @xmath1 , @xmath84 and @xmath109 or complex tensors . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , since most of @xmath44 are complex numbers , the minimum of @xmath110 must exist , and this value will decide how large a pc is able to treated as a single crystal if the influence of corner is not important . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one of the issues we proceed to research is the influence of corner . </S>",
    "<S> we thank prof . ping shen for his opinion to excite us to find out the 3d formula epwe method . </S>"
