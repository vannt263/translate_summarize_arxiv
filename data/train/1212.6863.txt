    "different cosmological scenarios have been devised to evade the initial singularity of the big bang standard model .",
    "these include bouncing universes and the emergent universe . here",
    "we shall focus on a representative of the latter put forward by ellis and maartens @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the initial singularity is replaced by an einstein static phase in which the scale factor of the friedmann - robertson - walker metric does not vanish and , accordingly , the energy density , pressure and so on stay finite .",
    "thus , the universe starts expanding from the said phase , smoothly joins a stage of exponential inflation followed by standard reheating to subsequently approach the classical thermal radiation dominated era of the conventional big bang cosmology .",
    "figure [ aba : fig1 ] depicts this evolution . fairly generally ,",
    "the static phase is dominated pressureless matter and radiation ( subscripts @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) , curvature ( which has to be positive , @xmath2 ) and a scalar field .",
    "thus the total energy density in this phase ( subscript @xmath3 ) obeys , @xmath4 . in this scenario",
    "the potential must be asymptotically flat in the infinite past , @xmath5 and fall toward a minimum at some finite value .",
    "accordingly , the field rolls down from the static state at @xmath6 and the potential slowly decreases from its initial value , @xmath7 , in the infinite past . to have acceleration",
    "the inequality @xmath8 ought to be fulfilled .",
    "since @xmath9 decreases and @xmath10 augments , at some time , say @xmath11 , inflation terminates , then @xmath12 oscillates about the minimum and reheating takes place , the latter followed by the radiation dominated era .",
    "as demonstrated by bekenstein , the entropy of a black hole plus the entropy of its surroundings can not diminish @xcite .",
    "this law , aptly named the  generalized second law \" ( gsl ) of thermodynamics as it considers conventional matter / fields and an event horizon , was extended by several authors to cosmological settings in which the black hole horizon is replaced by a causal cosmic horizon @xcite .",
    "this version of the said law establishes that the entropy of the horizon plus the entropy of the matter and fields within the horizon can never decrease . in this note",
    "we study which constraints ( if any ) the gsl imposes on the two intermediate phases , i.e. , from the static phase to exponential inflation and from the reheating to thermal radiation domination ( in the static , inflationary , and thermal radiation dominated phases the gsl is trivially fulfilled ; see @xcite for details ) . as causal horizon",
    "we shall consider the apparent horizon of area @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes its radius @xcite . notice that neither the particle horizon nor the event horizon exist in the static phase ; only the particle horizon is meaningful in all the phases considered here .",
    "neglecting quantum effects , the horizon entropy can be written as @xmath15 . assuming the scalar field is in a pure quantum state",
    ", the gsl reads @xmath16 , where the prime means derivative with respect the scale factor , @xmath17 .",
    "in the transition from the static to the inflationary phase ( @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ aba : fig1 ] ) one has @xmath19 , as well as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the equation of state parameter of the overall fluid -including the scalar field .    with the help of the einstein field equation @xmath23 it follows that the gsl is fulfilled provided the upper bound @xmath24}{|1\\ , + \\ , 3w|}\\ , , \\label{constraint2}\\ ] ] on the amount of radiation energy in the stationary phase",
    "is met -see @xcite for details .",
    "the transition between the period of exponential inflation and the thermal radiation dominated phase begins at @xmath25 and ends when the products of the inflaton decay at reheating get fully thermalized . in this phase ,",
    "@xmath26 , the pressureless matter particles have essentially disappeared , and again @xmath27 . in its turn",
    ", the entropy of the mixture of radiation and relativistic particles originated in the decay of the inflaton is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sderiv].2 ) , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 replaced by @xmath30 which is positive - definite .",
    "( the tilde is to reminds us that the mixture is not thermalized though @xmath31 as the thermalization process goes on ) .",
    "thus , in this transition the gsl is guaranteed .",
    "for a cosmological model to be worthy of consideration , aside from passing the observational tests , it must comply with thermodynamics ; more specifically , it must respect the gsl .",
    "we have shown that the toy model of ref .",
    "@xcite is thermodynamically safe provided that the radiation energy does not contribute largely to the static phase .",
    "finally , it should be explored if this nice feature is also present in other emergent scenarios .",
