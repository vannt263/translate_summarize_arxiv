    "the computation of the resistance between two nodes in a resistor network is a classical problem in electric circuit theory , indeed it was studied by numerous authors over many years . since electrical potentials on a grid are governed by the same difference equations as those occurring in other problems , the computation of the resistances can be applied to a wide range of problems , such as lattice green s functions , random walks , the theory of harmonic functions and others . due to variety of applications of the resistance problem and various methods of solution , this problem is still actual and intensively studied  @xcite .",
    "the resistance problem was often transformed in that of solving the difference equations , which is most conveniently carried out for infinite networks .",
    "little attention was paid to finite networks , though these are occurring in real life . in 2004 ,",
    "an important result for finite lattices was published in  @xcite .",
    "he expressed the resistance between two arbitrary nodes in a resistor network in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the laplacian matrix * l * associated with the network . in  @xcite ,",
    "the laplacian * l * is a real symmetric @xmath0 matrix with @xmath1 real eigenvalues @xmath2 and an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors @xmath3 .",
    "the resistance between the nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by @xmath6    however , if the laplacian matrix of the network is non - symmetric , the relation   fails .    in this work ,",
    "we study resistance networks with a real laplacian matrix * l * , symmetric or not .",
    "the laplacian * l * is a real diagonalizable @xmath0 matrix with @xmath1 real eigenvalues @xmath2 and two basis of mutually orthogonal left and right - hand eigenvectors @xmath7 . to our best knowledge , this is the first work that presents an explicit formula for the total resistance between two nodes in a resistor network with a real laplacian matrix , in general non - symmetric .",
    "the obtained formula    @xmath8    is an extension of  .",
    "the method used in this paper is similar to that of  @xcite , where the orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of the matrix * l * is replaced by two mutually orthogonal basis of left and right - hand eigenvectors of * l*.    the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : motivation ]",
    "our motivation coming from the fault analysis of integrated circuits is presented and the nodal conductance matrix of a circuit , which is the laplacian * l * , and some of its properties are described .",
    "section  [ sec : theoretical ] gives a theoretical framework , which is based on the theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real matrices .",
    "the existence of mutually orthogonal basis @xmath9 and @xmath10 of left and right - hand eigenvectors of a real diagonalizable matrix * a * is proved .",
    "keeping the vectors @xmath9 intact , a convenient basis of right eigenvectors is constructed .",
    "then , the main result is formulated as theorem and proved in the second part of section  [ sec : theoretical ] .",
    "section  [ sec : examples ] is devoted to calculating the two - point resistance for several circuit networks . the formula proved in section  [ sec : theoretical ]",
    "is demonstrated on a simple bridge for two cases : simple eigenvalues and multiple eigenvalues .",
    "also , an example of resistance calculation for a real life circuit , an operational amplifier , is given .",
    "today s integrated circuits ( ics ) represent complex systems realized on a small area using advanced fabrication technologies . at the early age of monolithic integration ( early sixties ) , the fabrication process was dominated by yield as low as 10% due to poor process control  @xcite .",
    "as the fabrication process has evolved , the process control reached acceptable limits and the yield improved . on the other hand , with the increasing resolution ,",
    "the fabrication process became more sensitive to impurities of the environment and had to be moved to controlled areas , where the ambient impurity level was under control .",
    "these days , a typical mixed - signal ic can consist of thousands to millions of transistors , occupy an area of several tens of square mm , while the fabrication process yield with resolution as high as tens of nanometers is well above 90% .",
    "anyhow , even in a well controlled environment , the ambient still exhibits certain level of impurities . besides , the fabrication process control is becoming even more complex and thus , resulting in a necessity to test the produced ics .    during the test development process",
    ", so called _ fault simulations _ have to be conducted to determine the fault coverage of a given test .",
    "if performed in a traditional way , this step might be rather time consuming , since it requires a huge amount of simulations to be executed due to large amount of circuit nodes and possible faults taken into account . during the simulation , a set of nonlinear equations describing the circuit has to be solved using an iterative algorithm , e.g. newton - raphson .",
    "application of such an algorithm to circuit analysis is described in  @xcite .",
    "the numerical approach to dc fault simulations , presented in this paper , evaluates the resistance between two arbitrary nodes of the circuit in a more time efficient way .",
    "this evaluation requires only one simulation for the given circuit configuration , providing information on the operating point , to be executed .",
    "it means that a system of nonlinear equations describing the circuit has to be solved only once for the given operating point . from this operating point information ,",
    "the circuit s nodal conductance matrix can be created and the resistance between the selected two nodes can be calculated .",
    "as has been already shown for symmetrical matrices , such an approach can lead to a significant analysis time reduction  @xcite .",
    "this resistance calculation can be used in the development of resistance - based tests , e.g. @xmath11 testing , where the resistance is indirectly evaluated by measuring the current flowing from the supply source  @xcite . for a circuit network ,",
    "where active elements such as mos transistors are present , the nodal conductance matrix can become non - symmetrical , since voltage - controlled current sources ( vccs ) are used to model such devices , as described below .",
    "formulation of the nodal conductance matrix , which is the laplacian , is based on the kirchhoff current law ( kcl ) which states the following  @xcite    @xmath12    here , @xmath13 is the conductance of a resistor connected to nodes @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the electrical potentials at nodes @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath18 is the current flowing into the network at node @xmath14 .",
    "the prime denotes the omission of the term @xmath19 . as a consequence",
    ", the following constraint applies :    @xmath20    in general , a circuit of @xmath1 nodes can be described by a matrix equation of the form :    @xmath21    or    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the laplacian ( nodal conductance matrix ) with elements @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a column vector of node potentials , and @xmath26 is a column vector of independent current sources  @xcite .    to compute the resistance between two arbitrary nodes @xmath27 of the network , an external source has to be connected to these nodes . let the current flowing from the source be @xmath28 and the potentials at the two nodes @xmath29 . then the desired resistance is determined by the ohm s law    @xmath30    now",
    ", the computation is reduced to solving   for @xmath29 with the current given by    @xmath31    an important property of the @xmath23 matrix is    @xmath32    from this equation follows , that since the kcl requires the sum on the right side to be zero , the sum of conductances in each column of @xmath23 is equal to zero .",
    "another important property is given by  :    @xmath33    since @xmath17 is a nonzero voltage source , the sum must be equal to zero .",
    "therefore , the sum of conductances in each row of @xmath23 is equal to zero .",
    "as long as the network consists of resistances only , the laplacian remains symmetric , since for a resistive element of a conductance @xmath34 connected between the nodes @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the nodal conductance matrix @xmath35 can be expressed as follows :    @xmath36    if this matrix is added to the laplacian of the network , the symmetry of the laplacian is maintained . on the other hand , if a vccs is present in the network , the laplacian can become non - symmetrical in cases when the input terminals are connected to different nodes as the output ones . in general , the nodal conductance matrix @xmath37 of a vccs , as depicted in  , can be written as    @xmath38        since most of the real life circuits contain active elements that are represented by vccss , an extension of the approach published in  @xcite to non - symmetrical laplacians is of great importance .",
    "in various applications based on matrix theory , a diagonalization of a square matrix is needed . a real @xmath0 matrix * a * is diagonalizable , if there exists an invertible matrix * p * such that @xmath39 , where * d * is a diagonal matrix . here , column vectors of * p * are right - hand eigenvectors of * a * and row vectors of @xmath40 are left - hand eigenvectors .",
    "when the matrix * a * is symmetric , the eigenvectors can be chosen to form an orthonormal basis of @xmath41 . in this case ,",
    "* p * is an orthogonal matrix and @xmath40 equals the transpose of * p*. the diagonal elements of * d * are eigenvalues of both * a * as * d*.    when a diagonalizable matrix * a * is non - symmetric , the orthogonality of eigenvectors fails .",
    "nevertheless , since neither the orthogonality of right eigenvectors nor that of left ones is necessary in our approach , this problem can be overpassed . what we need , is the mutual orthogonality of the left and right eigenvectors . then , if @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote matrices of left and right - hand eigenvectors of a square matrix * a * , the matrix @xmath44 is diagonal .",
    "its diagonal elements are not necessarilly the eigenvalues of * a*.    we state our main result as a theorem . in its proof , we use a similar method as in the proof of theorem in  @xcite .    from kirchhoff s law we know that at least one eigenvalue of laplacian matrix * l * is zero .",
    "we consider this eigenvalue simple and put @xmath45 .",
    "the associated left and right - hand eigenvectors are @xmath46 .",
    "the condition of orthogonality of left and right - hand eigenvectors @xmath47 can be fulfilled for arbitrary diagonalizable matrix that satisfies any other condition of the following theorem . + * theorem . * _ consider a resistance network with @xmath1 nodes defined by a diagonalizable laplacian matrix @xmath23 not necessarily symmetric .",
    "suppose that @xmath23 has @xmath1 real eigenvalues @xmath2 ( including the multiplicity ) with left and right - hand eigenvectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are orthogonal if and only if @xmath52 .",
    "denote @xmath53 the zero eigenvalue .",
    "then the resistance between nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by _",
    "* proof . * since one of eigenvalues of * l",
    "* is zero , introducing of @xmath55 to the laplacian * l * will be helpful .",
    "thus we will manipulate the laplacian @xmath56 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath57 are @xmath58 and for a suitable value of @xmath59 , no one of them equals zero .",
    "the left and right - hand eigenvectors are those of * l*. similarly as in  @xcite , we will compute the inverse function @xmath60 of @xmath57 .    naturally , @xmath57 is not symmetric , because * l * is not .",
    "non - symmetric matrices * l * and @xmath57 are diagonalizable as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the matrix of left - hand eigenvectors ( rows ) and @xmath63 that of right - hand eigenvectors ( columns ) of * l * and @xmath57 . finally , @xmath64 is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are @xmath65 .",
    "both @xmath62 and @xmath63 are invertible , because @xmath66 as well as @xmath67 define a basis of @xmath41 . from   we",
    "obtain    @xmath68    hence    @xmath69    really , @xmath70 is an inverse matrix of @xmath57 , because    @xmath71 ,    as well as    @xmath72 .",
    "from   it follows that elements of the matrix @xmath70 are    @xmath73    so , the function @xmath70 is explicitly expressed .",
    "now , return to the equation @xmath74 and multiply it from the left by @xmath70 .",
    "we obtain @xmath75 .",
    "coordinates of the vector @xmath76 are    @xmath77    denote in     @xmath78    the substitution of @xmath79 in   yields @xmath80 since @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 and we can put @xmath83.this gives    @xmath84    where @xmath16 and @xmath85 replace @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we use   in @xmath88 which is     @xmath89    due to   we obtain    @xmath90    the last expression can be simplified as    @xmath91    we introduce   with @xmath83 and   becomes    @xmath92    a simple rearrangement of the last relation returns  .",
