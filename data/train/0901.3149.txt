    "everywhere we look , baryons are missing .",
    "globally , observations only account for around half the baryons today  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "simulations indicate that the missing baryons are contained in intergalactic gas at @xmath5  k , called the warm - hot intergalactic medium  ( whim ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "initially , absorbers seen in quasar spectra were thought to be collisionally - ionized tracers of whim gas  @xcite .",
    "but recent simulations and observations suggest that most intergalactic is actually photo - ionized  ( * ? ? ? * and refs therein ) , and so the whim must be traced using higher ionization lines  ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "baryons are also missing on galactic scales .",
    "current hierarchical structure formation models predict that baryons do not substantially decouple from dark matter until well inside of halos , hence the expectation is that halos should contain roughly the cosmic fraction of baryons .",
    "however , dynamical modeling of the milky way s disk and halo reveals that it contains at best half of its cosmic share of baryons in stars and cold gas  @xcite ; the same is true of m31  @xcite .",
    "this is the  missing halo baryons \" problem . either a substantial portion of the @xmath6 galaxies halo baryons are in some heretofore hidden form , or else there has been a sizeable exodus of baryons into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "many models have advocated the former possibility , suggesting by analogy with the whim that the missing halo gas is in some warm - hot component  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or cold clouds  @xcite . however , there is little observational evidence for massive coronae of hot gas around typical spirals  @xcite , and furthermore if all halos contained such coronae , this would substantially overpredict the soft x - ray background  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the mass in cold clumps as traced by high velocity clouds is unlikely to be sizeable even in optimistic scenarios  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite developed an analytic model that argued for a substantial fraction of baryons being removed by galactic outflows .",
    "in fact , silk presciently predicted that such outflows could solve a surprisingly wide range of current dilemmas in galaxy formation , which our simulations have largely confirmed .",
    "clusters also seem to have a missing baryon problem . in a recent census by @xcite ,",
    "baryons make up @xmath7% of the mass of the cluster , while the latest wmap-5 results  @xcite favor a cosmic mean value of @xmath8% .",
    "this is a small but persistent discrepancy which could have implications for using clusters as probes of precision cosmology .    in these proceedings",
    "we examine the baryonic content of galaxy halos in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with and without galactic outflows .",
    "the outflow model implemented in our simulations is unique in that it matches detailed properties of a wide range of outflow - related observables , including igm enrichment at various epochs  @xcite , the galaxy mass - metallicity relation  @xcite , early galaxy luminosity functions  @xcite , and intragroup gas enrichment and entropy  @xcite .",
    "even though our modeling of outflows is parameterized and heuristic , these successes suggest that it plausibly moves mass , metals , and energy on large scales in a manner consistent with the real universe .",
    "-0.5 in    -0.5 in    we run simulations using our modified version of gadget-2  @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "the runs here employ @xmath9 particles in volumes of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with our wmap3-concordant _ d - series _ cosmology  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we identify halos using a spherical overdensity algorithm  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and consider only  resolved \" halos with masses @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the dark matter and gas particles masses for the @xmath15 volumes , respectively .",
    "we run two versions of these simulations : one with no winds , and one with our favored momentum - driven ( m - d ) wind model that matches a range of data as mentioned above .",
    "outflows are implemented in a probabalistic monte carlo fashion by giving kicks to gas particles ; details are in @xcite .",
    "the fraction of baryons within halos are shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : halofcomp ] . in the no - wind case ( blue points , upper swath ) , halos of milky way s size and below have , as expected , roughly their cosmic share of baryons ( shown by the dotted line at @xmath16 ) . in detail",
    ", adiabatic contraction causes the baryon fraction to typically be slightly greater than the cosmic mean .",
    "this shows that without any strong feedback , baryons do indeed mostly trace dark matter on halo scales in @xmath17 galaxies .    in more massive halos ( @xmath18 ) , the increasing predominance of hot halo gas  (",
    "* see also bottom panels of figure  [ fig : halofcomp ] ) causes pressure support that pushes baryons farther out than the dark matter , and the baryon content is lowered . at the highest masses probed by @xmath0 ( @xmath19 ) , this reduction reaches 6% , which is not trivial but still insufficient to explain observed cluster baryon fractions .",
    "now we consider the m - d wind runs , shown by the lower ( green ) swath of points .",
    "outflows have a dramatic impact , increasingly so to smaller halo masses .",
    "already by @xmath2 , typical halos ( @xmath20 ) have had their baryon fraction reduced by @xmath21% compared to the cosmic mean . at @xmath2",
    "there is only a mild trend with halo mass , but by @xmath0 the trend becomes much stronger : milky way - sized halos ( @xmath22 ) have lost roughly 40% of their baryons , while the smallest halos we probe at @xmath23 have lost 60% .",
    "this indicates that _ missing halo baryons have mostly been ejected by outflows .",
    "_    outflows have a noticeable impact on large halos as well .",
    "@xcite showed that outflows add substantial entropy on poor group scales , and this translates into increased pressure support over the no - wind case . with outflows , the most massive ( @xmath18 )",
    "halos now contain only 85% of their cosmic share of baryons , and the trend is essentially flat with halo mass .",
    "this value is in better agreement with observational estimates @xcite .",
    "the falling baryon fraction in low - mass halos is a consequence of wind recycling in our outflow model , i.e. the re - accretion of previously ejected wind material . in @xcite",
    ", we found that small galaxies push their winds out farther relative to large galaxies ( owing primarily to the fact that they reside in less dense surroundings ) , and as a result the time for winds to be re - accreted onto small systems is longer . at early epochs",
    ", recycling is relatively unimportant , because there hasnt been sufficient time to permit substantial re - accretion .",
    "the weak trend seen at @xmath2 owes to the fact that our mass loss rate scales inversely with velocity dispersion in our momentum - driven wind scalings . by @xmath0 , however , the longer recycling times in smaller systems results in much more cumulative mass loss from small halos relative to larger halos . hence _",
    "differential wind recycling is the dominant driver in establishing the baryon fraction trends with halo mass . _",
    "as we will see next , it is also critical for regulating the star formation efficiency in smaller systems .",
    "we now separate baryons within each halo into three phases : stars , cool gas ( @xmath24k ) , and hot gas ( @xmath25k ) .",
    "star - forming gas is included in cool gas .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ fig : halofcomp ] show the baryon fractions in stars and hot gas , respectively ; the remainder is in cool gas ( not shown ) . in this section",
    "we examine stellar baryon fractions .    with no outflows ,",
    "there is a serious overcooling problem : star formation is far too efficient . in sub-@xmath4 halos ,",
    "the fraction of baryons in stars approaches 90% , while observed small galaxies have stellar fractions under 10% .",
    "moreover , the trend is wrong ; with no winds , smaller galaxies have a higher baryon fraction in stars , while the shallow slope of the stellar mass function below @xmath4 relative to the halo mass function indicates that the stellar mass fraction should be lower in small halos . at group scales ,",
    "the stellar baryon fraction is down to 25% of the cosmic mean , but that is still too high compared to data as pointed out in @xcite . of course",
    ", these results are not surprising , as it is well known that outflows , particularly at early epochs , are required to suppress overcooling  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with outflows ,",
    "the situation improves dramatically .",
    "stellar fractions are reduced to a maximum of @xmath26% for @xmath3 halos , falling to either smaller or larger halos .",
    "a milky way - sized halo now has a @xmath27 stellar fraction ( relative to @xmath28 ) , which is in general agreement with observations of comparable disk galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the stellar fraction drops towards lower halo masses , suggesting a flatter stellar mass function compared to the halo mass function , as observed .",
    "the slope of the @xmath0 fit ( red line ) is approximately @xmath29 for @xmath30 , which when combined with the halo mass function slope of @xmath31 , yields a stellar mass function slope of @xmath32 .",
    "this is in general agreement with observations of the sub-@xmath4 stellar mass function slope  @xcite , though still too steep ; in fact , the faint - end slope turns out to be even shallower , as will be shown in a forthcoming paper .",
    "note that the stellar fraction slope at @xmath2 is less steep , reflecting the shallower slope in the overall halo baryon fraction ( top right panel ) .",
    "our models naturally yield a flattening of the faint end slope with time .",
    "the qualitative trend of the star formation efficiency having a maximum at some mass and dropping fairly rapidly to low masses , along with the faint end slope evolution , is a direct consequence of differential wind recycling . without it ,",
    "the star formation efficiency would continue to increase to small masses , as in the no - wind case",
    ". hence models of galaxy formation must not only include outflows , but must also track the _ dynamics _ of wind material on its journey through the igm to properly capture its impact on galaxy evolution .",
    "turning to the hot gas ( @xmath33  k ) baryon fractions ( bottom panels of figure  [ fig : halofcomp ] ) , there is a strong trend of hot gas fraction increasing with halo mass , which is mostly independent of redshift and whether or not outflows are included . in the no - wind case ,",
    "the hot gas fraction exceeds the stellar fraction ( which comprises the vast majority of condensed baryons ) at @xmath0 for @xmath34 .",
    "this transition occurs at a somewhat larger mass than found in @xcite , likely because our runs include metal - line cooling .    with outflows ,",
    "the fraction of halo gas in hot form is more substantial , exceeding the stellar fraction in the outflow case at all masses probed here .",
    "this is due to the suppression of star formation , rather than an increase in the amount of hot gas .",
    "relative to the baryon fraction , the hot gas fraction is about one - third of all halo baryons at the smallest masses probed , and increases to three - fourths or more for @xmath18 .",
    "this indicates that there is still a substantial reservoir of baryons in a difficult - to - detect phase within typical galaxies , and indeed x - ray observations do indicate a warm - hot corona around a nearby spiral galaxy  @xcite . however , the amount of hot gas we predict is still a factor of two to three smaller than in models that place the majority of missing halo baryons into this phase .",
    "this roughly translates into up to an order of magnitude reduction in the predicted x - ray flux  ( as compared to e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence the typical non - detection of x - ray halos around spiral galaxies should not be surprising , but deeper observations with future x - ray telescopes should uncover this phase more ubiquitously .    it is noteworthy that our outflows do not significantly increase the amount of hot gas into halos ( as seen by comparing to the no - wind case ) .",
    "winds in our models tend to escape halos without depositing a significant amount of energy along the way via shocks .",
    "this is contrary to typical assumptions in analytic or semi - analytic models of outflows  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and simply reflects the fact that in realistic three - dimensional models outflows prefer to blow holes rather than share their energy with ambient gas .",
    "this is also consistent with x - ray observations of hot gas around galaxies that indicate they are radiating a small fraction of the supernova energy input  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another factor is that outflows are typically quite enriched , so that the gas cooling times are short , and hence even if outflow material is heated it condenses out quickly . at low-@xmath35",
    "this results in a  halo fountain \" that may be the origin of compact high velocity clouds  @xcite .",
    "we have examined halo baryon fraction in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , comparing models with and without galactic outflows .",
    "our outflow model is heuristic , but is well - constrained to match a variety of galaxy and igm observations at a range of epochs .",
    "we find that these same outflows may help resolve some puzzles regarding the baryonic content of galactic halos",
    ".    for low mass halos , outflows remove a significant portion of halo baryons by @xmath0 .",
    "the fraction of ejected baryons increases sharply to lower masses , so that @xmath36 halos have lost 40% of their baryons , and @xmath37 halos 60% .",
    "the trend is not as pronounced at @xmath2 , showing that the longer wind recycling times in small galaxies ( i.e. differential wind recycling ) plays a critical role in suppressing the baryon fractions in small halos between @xmath38 .",
    "this may explain why the faint - end slope of the luminosity function becomes shallower with time . by today , this produces a peak in star formation efficiency at @xmath39 , above and below which the efficiency falls . meanwhile , hot gas fractions are mostly unaffected by outflows , showing that outflows do not deposit much of their energy into halo gas , instead preferring to blow holes and escape .",
    "a milky way - sized halo today has about 60% of its cosmic share of baryons , half of which are in hot gas , one - third in cool gas , and the remainder in stars .    for high mass halos ( @xmath18 )",
    ", there is a mild suppression of baryon fractions owing to larger pressure support from an increasingly substantial hot gaseous halo . without winds ,",
    "the suppression is fairly small ( @xmath40 ) . in our outflow run ,",
    "conversely , the suppression is much more substantial , @xmath41 , independent of mass , which agrees better with data .",
    "this demonstrates that outflows impact even massive halos today .",
    "the key is that most of the ejection occurs at early epochs , when those halos were much smaller .",
    "our implementation of outflows is primarily constrained to match igm enrichment at @xmath42  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that this model naturally yields observationally - consistent results for halo baryon fractions at @xmath43 is highly encouraging , and represents another significant success for our outflow model based on momentum - driven wind scalings",
    ". it may be that we are approaching a heuristic understanding of how outflows operate on extragalactic scales , even though the detailed mechanisms by which outflows are driven out of galaxies remain unclear .",
