    "most radio - loud quasars contain a compact , parsec - scale , flat - spectrum radio core , and lower - surface - brightness extended kiloparsec lobes .",
    "the wide range in the ratio of core to total lobe emission is usually attributed to doppler boosting of the core in those sources that contain a jet aligned close to the observer s line of sight .",
    "but a substantial fraction of radio - loud quasars do not fit into this ` unified model ' .",
    "these are the _ compact steep - spectrum quasars _",
    "( css quasars ) , which are characterized by a steep power - law radio spectrum , usually with a low - frequency turnover below 1  ghz due to synchrotron self absorption , and sometimes with spectral flattening at high frequencies .",
    "the radio structures extend no more than about 15 kpc .",
    "about 30 per cent of radio sources found in high - frequency surveys have spectra of this type ( peacock & wall 1982 ) .",
    "a review is found in odea ( 1998 ) .",
    "the essential difference between css quasars and those with flat core spectra has not yet been identified .",
    "the css sources , as a class , can not be normal extended double sources seen end - on , because in most cases the overall size is smaller than the lobe - widths of normal double sources , and the low - frequency spectral turnover occurs at higher frequencies .",
    "there are also too many css sources for them all to be attributed to projection effects ( fanti et al .",
    ".    the role of relativistic boosting in the vlbi structures may not be as significant in css quasars as in their flat - spectrum counterparts ( odea 1998 ) .",
    "however , in 3c147 and 3c309.1 , for example , the x - ray flux densities from _ einstein _",
    "are smaller than the inverse - compton emission predicted from the radio flux densities , thus providing evidence for bulk relativistic motion ( simon et al .",
    "1983 ; kus et al .  1990 ) .",
    "superluminal motion is detected in 3c216 , 3c309.1 , 3c380 and 3c138 ( barthel et al .  1988 ; kus et al .",
    "1993 ; cotton et al .",
    "1997 ) , although it is now thought that 3c216 and 3c380 may be large doubles in projection rather than true members of the css class ( odea 1998 ) .",
    "less controversially , in contrast to flat - spectrum quasars it appears that the jets of css quasars have more complex and distorted morphology and have not escaped from the host galaxy . while the underlying cause ( whether they are young or are smothered by dense interstellar gas ) remains an issue of debate , some level of interaction between the radio jets and the local galactic environment would seem inevitable .",
    "x - ray measurements of css quasars are important for the following reasons : ( a ) in conjunction with radio vlbi observations , they place lower limits on the bulk flow velocity in the emitting regions by the inverse - compton argument ; ( b ) they may show evidence for higher neutral gas density in these objects than in other quasars ; ( c ) they may be able to show whether an additional emission mechanism ( e.g. , thermal ) is operating , or whether all the radiation is consistent with a nuclear and jet origin ; ( d ) large spectral differences between objects may indicate that they do not form a homogeneous class .",
    "our best composite x - ray knowledge to date comes from objects drawn from the 3crr sample ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) . _",
    "_  observed several such css quasars , but the derived overall knowledge of their soft x - ray spectra is poor compared with other classes of radio - loud quasars ( figure  [ fig : xml ] ) .",
    "radio - loud , flat - spectrum core - dominated quasars have spectra consistent with a power law with a typical energy spectral index in the sense @xmath2 @xmath3 ( worrall & wilkes 1990 ) , and there is a tendency for the slope to steepen with decreasing core dominance ( shastri et al .",
    "it is not known whether the large contour for css sources in figure  [ fig : xml ] is because of poor statistics or because they show a much larger spread in their x - ray spectral indices .    8.0 cm    in this paper we report _ rosat _  and _ chandra _  x - ray results for 3c48 , one of the strongest and most peculiar css quasars .",
    "we present previously unreported variability between the two observations with the _ rosat _  position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and within the observation with the high resolution imager ( hri ) . in comparison with an earlier _ einstein _",
    "observatory observation we infer the presence of a two - component spectrum which is supported by the new _ chandra _  data .",
    "we also present new multifrequency _ vlba _  observations which we use to predict the non - thermal x - ray emission for comparison with the x - ray results .    to ease comparison with earlier work we use a cosmology in which @xmath4  km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 . at 3c48 s",
    "redshift of 0.367 , 1  arcsec corresponds to 6.8  kpc in the source frame .",
    "3c48  was the second quasar to be recognized ( matthews & sandage 1963 ; greenstein & matthews 1963 ) .",
    "it is classified as a css source on the basis of its steep radio spectrum and its small angular size .",
    "the integrated radio spectrum shows a low - frequency peak at about 100  mhz and is reasonably straight ( a slight concave curvature ) from @xmath7  mhz to @xmath8  ghz with @xmath9 at 1  ghz ( ott et al .",
    "most of the radio emission occurs on a scale less than about 0.6  arcsec ( @xmath10 kpc ) , although at low frequencies there is emission on scales up to 3.5 arcsec ( hartas et al .",
    "1983 ; woan 1992 ) .",
    "vlbi images [ wilkinson et al .  1990 , 1991 ( 1.6  ghz ) ; simon et al .  1990 ( 329  mhz ) ; nan et al .",
    "1991 ( 608  mhz ) ] show a compact , inverted - spectrum ` core ' , a , at the southern end of the source , with a ` hotspot ' , b , 50  mas to the north of a , from which a one - sided , broad disrupted jet or plume extends @xmath11 arcsec to the north and northeast .",
    "this is unlike most other css sources which generally show more - or - less symmetrical double or triple structures .",
    "the vlbi images show no sign of a counterjet , but a high dynamic - range _ vla _  image at 8 ghz ( briggs 1995 ) finds a component on the counterjet side , with an inferred jet - counterjet ratio around 100:1 .",
    "there have been no vlbi images published at frequencies higher than 1.6  ghz .",
    "the flux density appears to be variable by a few per cent over decades at frequencies above a ghz ( ott et al .",

    "3c48  has associated optical nebulosity .",
    "broad and narrow [ oiii ] and [ oii ] emission - line regions form a chain of compact knots which extends to 6 arcsec north of the core , beyond the radio structures ; photoionization by the quasar nucleus is believed to play the dominant role in this gas excitation ( axon et al .",
    "excess continuum and emission - line nebulosity closer to the quasar core , and in particular at about 1 arcsec northeast of the nucleus , is variously interpreted as the nucleus of a galaxy merging with the host galaxy of 3c48(stockton & ridgway 1991 ) or a radio - jet - related star - forming region ( chatzichristou , vanderriest & jaffe 1999 ) .",
    "3c48  has unusually strong infrared emission ( neugebauer , soifer , & miley 1985 ) , comparable with the most luminous infrared galaxies , and the detection of co emission ( scoville et al .",
    "1993 ) implies the presence of about twice as much molecular gas as in ultraluminous _",
    "iras _ galaxies .",
    "this evidence , together with the irregular appearance of the galaxy in optical continuum ( stockton & ridgway 1991 ) , supports the idea of a recent merger .",
    "fabian et al .  ( 1987 ) suggest that the extensive emission - line nebulosity is photoionized gas resulting from a cooling flow of @xmath12  yr@xmath5 rather than a galaxy merger .",
    "3c48  was detected in x - rays with the _ einstein _  ipc on 1980 jul 25 ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "the spectrum was consistent with a power - law with @xmath13 and a flux density at 1  kev of @xmath14 @xmath15jy ( 90 per cent errors for 2 interesting parameters ; @xmath16 ) .",
    "( our reanalysis of the data shows the quoted error in flux density is more appropriate for @xmath17 for 2 interesting parameters ; @xmath18 . )",
    "the _ rosat _  observations , whose",
    "dates and exposure times are given in table  [ tab : xobs ] , were made with the source in the center of the telescope field of view and in normal ` wobble ' mode during the pointed phase of the mission .",
    "3c48  was observed twice with the pspc and once with the hri .",
    "the data were corrected for instrumental effects and the motion of the satellite .",
    "our analysis of the hri data includes ` dewobbling ' ( harris et al .",
    "1998 ) to remove some of the time - dependent aspect uncertainties arising from pixel - to - pixel gain variations in the aspect camera ccd , as well as the use of a broadened psf ( calculated by fitting to data within 10 arcsec of the source centroid ) to take account of residual aspect uncertainties .",
    "our analysis used the post reduction off - line software ( pros x - ray package which runs in the iraf environment .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , < , < , > , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the nic contribution would be increased if the ir radiation were increased through beaming . to contribute the observed x - rays , assuming equipartition , a component of beamed ir emission would need both to be about a factor of 100 brighter than the measured ir ( as seen by the jet ) and have a rather large opening angle ( figure  [ fig : vlbimaps ] ) to cover the whole jet .",
    "although such extra ir emission can not be ruled out , there are no observations of which we are aware which support the presence of dominant beamed ir emission . on the contrary , meissenheimer et al.(2001 )",
    "argue that radio galaxies and quasars have similar ir luminosities , implying that the emission seen is emitted isotropically . to get a maximum gain from scattering geometry",
    ", the nuclear beamed emission should be directed away from the line of sight .",
    "it then seems most likely that equal and opposite beamed emission should dominate the ir which is observed , and this is insufficient to produce the observed x - rays .",
    "we thus consider it unlikely that beamed ir radiation is the dominant photon source for producing the x - rays .      in figure",
    "[ fig : const ] we presented the range of beaming parameters that are consistent with the observed sidedness and the possible detection of sub - luminal motion .",
    "as a representative example we take @xmath19 and @xmath20 degrees , giving a bulk relativistic doppler factor of @xmath21 .",
    "we take the projection of the velocity vector on the sky to point along the direction of apparent motion of component b , i.e. approximately n on the radio map . in this model ,",
    "the boosted cmb radiation is the dominant photon population in the source frame ( table  [ tab : icftab ] ) .",
    "inverse - square law and doppler effects greatly reduce the effects of the nuclear illumination .",
    "the resulting total predicted x - ray emission is two orders of magnitude below the observed value .",
    "the magnetic field would have to be considerably below the equipartition value to achieve results approaching the observed x - ray flux , and we conclude that in this beamed model the plume is highly unlikely to contribute to any significant extent to the observed x - rays",
    ".    we can ask how large the beaming would need to be to increase the cmb / ic prediction to the observed level .",
    "the result is that we would require all the electrons in the plume to have @xmath22 , @xmath23 degrees , @xmath24 . unless the source has an unusually small intrinsic opening angle which is maintained for hundreds of kpc close to the line of sight",
    ", only a fraction of the electrons will participate in such boosting , and these parameters represent a lower limit to the required beaming .",
    "we thus conclude that it is unlikely that all the observed hard x - ray emission is from this mechanism .      a possible site for radio - related x - ray emission ( although not one which alone would explain the position of 3c48  in figure  [ fig : xrplot ] ) is emission from within component a. here the nic can be high if the radio component is unbeamed . for example , modelling the photon and electron spectra as above , and providing the photon illumination from a point source embedded in the base of a cylindrical jet of radius 0.25  mas ( from gaussian fits to two components ) and length 4  mas ( from measurement ) , we predict x - ray emission of 20  njy at 1  kev , somewhat above that from the extended plume .",
    "our modelling of the far - infrared radiation source as point - like to component a is probably consistent with meisenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) s interpretation as originating from the type of dusty torus required by models unifying radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "however , if the source of this radiation is larger than component a , or if it is point - like and the quasar nucleus is south of component a , the predicted x - ray flux will be lower . taking the adopted geometry at face value",
    ", it is possible to make the hard x - ray component with a magnetic field strength only a factor of two to three below equipartition .",
    "this is in line with the level of field deduced from x - ray inverse compton measurements in components of powerful radio galaxies and quasars on larger scales ( e.g. , brunetti et al .",
    "1999 ; hardcastle et al .",
    "our modelling finds a declining x - ray to radio ratio with distance from the nucleus when knot a and the plume are compared under similar equipartition assumptions .    while the fast variability seen at soft x - ray energies with _",
    "_  may suggest unbeamed emission from the high - energy spectral tail of an accretion disc , we can consider the alternative possibility that we are seeing a somewhat larger beamed component embedded in the core . simple models of a spherical moving blob have proved relatively successful in describing the multiwavelength spectra of blazars up to gamma - ray ( and in some cases tev ) energies via ssc or inverse compton scattering of external photons ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "the energy at which the compton - scattered emission becomes dominant as a hard component is normally in the x - ray band , and so may explain the concave spectrum that we observe . in figure",
    "[ fig : blazar ] we plot the spectrum of the core , together with an example ssc model .",
    "we have chosen beaming parameters consistent with the constraints at larger radii ( assuming a symmetrical jet ) of figure [ fig : const ] , and a source size which is consistent with the observed soft x - ray variability .",
    "the model parameters are selected to describe roughly the level of x - ray emission while not overproducing emission at lower energies .",
    "the radio emission , much of the far - ir emission , and the blue bump are not described by the model , and the position of 3c48  in figure [ fig : xrplot ] is not explained .",
    "measurements of gamma rays from 3c48  could help establish the credibility of an embedded blazar explanation for the x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 3c48  is the composite of a soft , steep - spectrum component and harder , power - law emission of slope consistent with the 1  ghz radio spectrum .",
    "the variability measured with _ rosat",
    "_  suggests that at least part of the x - ray emission ( principally the softest ) arises from a region of accretion - disc size or from a beamed blazar component .",
    "the _ chandra _  data give only a marginal detection of extended emission .",
    "even if this component is real and due to cluster gas , the radio plume is over - pressured unless it is beamed towards us at an angle of less than 0.4 degrees to the line of sight and a bulk velocity of more than 0.985c .",
    "the gas pressure at the radius of the extended emission - line regions is at most @xmath25 pa .",
    "we have used our new multifrequency _ vlba _  data to study the relationship between the x - ray and radio components .",
    "there is no excess absorption in the x - ray spectrum which might have allowed us to conclude that 3c48  is small ( most of the emission is within 0.5 arcsec of the nucleus ) because it is bottled up by cold neutral gas .",
    "we find weak ( @xmath0 ) evidence for a proper motion of @xmath26 in the compact radio component b , about 0.05 arcsec from the core .",
    "it is quite plausible that the radio emission from 3c48  undergoes sufficient interaction with the external medium that the source is intrinsically one sided at such distances from the nucleus . in that case",
    "relativistic beaming may not be important .",
    "however , if we assume intrinsic symmetry , the upper limit to the flux of knot b s counterjet and the measured proper motion combine to suggest that relativistic boosting along the line of sight is important .",
    "the x - ray emission of core - dominated radio - loud quasars is believed to be dominated by non - thermal radiation from the radio core , and indeed these sources show a good correlation between radio and x - ray flux .",
    "the fact that 3c48  is consistent with the correlation leads to an expectation that substantial x - ray emission should arise from its radio features . at vlbi resolution ,",
    "3c48  is unusual as compared with flat - spectrum quasars in that less than 1 per cent of its 1.5-ghz flux density arises from the core , and so x - ray emission from these extended radio regions would be required .",
    "the radio source is so compact that even _",
    "s resolution is insufficient to resolve spatially any x - ray emission from the radio structures .",
    "however , using the x - ray spectral results we find that synchrotron - emitting electrons in the radio plume could contribute significantly to the harder x - ray emission through ssc and up - scattering infra - red emission from the quasar nucleus .",
    "this requires the radio - regions to be free from relativistic boosting , in which case we would infer that the radio source is intrinsically one sided at distances of 300 pc and more from the nucleus , and it requires that the magnetic field is a factor of six to ten below the equipartition value .",
    "stringent requirements on the jet opening angle make it unlikely that all of the x - ray emission is from a fast jet which sees boosted cmb emission and emits beamed x - rays in the observer s frame , the model which is currently the most popular for explaining resolved x - ray emission from large - scale quasar jets .",
    "the possibility remains that the x - ray emission from 3c48  arises from close to the central engine .",
    "it may be unrelated to the radio emission , either from an embedded blazar or associated with the accretion processes , or the hard x - ray emission may arise from the up - scattering of infra - red emission from the quasar nucleus if the geometry is favourable and the magnetic field in the inner region is a factor of two to three below equipartition .",
    "the fact that the ratio of x - ray to radio emission is so close to that in quasars where a radio - x - ray relationship is established is then a coincidence .",

    "<S> we combine results from _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ , and multifrequency _ vlba_observations of the compact steep spectrum quasar 3c48  in an attempt to understand why the radio source is so small and unusual . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum shows no evidence for the excess absorption which might have allowed us to conclude that 3c48  is small because it is bottled up by cold neutral gas . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that the x - ray spectrum of the nucleus is made up of a soft , variable , steep - spectrum component , and harder , power - law emission of slope consistent with the 1  ghz radio spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of 3c48 s x - ray to radio ratio to that seen in core - dominated radio - loud quasars leads us to examine the possibility that the harder x - ray emission is inverse compton radiation from the radio source , which is more than 99 per cent resolved in our _ vlba _  data . </S>",
    "<S> the weak ( @xmath0 ) evidence that we find for a proper motion of @xmath1 in a compact radio component about 0.05 arcsec from the core implies that if this component has a highly relativistic bulk motion , it is at a very small angle to the line of sight </S>",
    "<S> . however , stringent requirements on the jet opening angle make it unlikely that all the x - ray emission is from a fast jet which sees boosted cosmic microwave background emission and emits beamed x - rays in the observer s frame . </S>",
    "<S> if the unusual radio structures are intrinsically one - sided and unbeamed , the inverse compton mechanism can provide an appreciable fraction of the x - ray emission if the magnetic field strength is a factor of six to ten below that which gives equal energy in radiating relativistic particles and magnetic fields and roughly minimizes the total energy in the source . </S>",
    "<S> it remains possible that the unresolved x - ray emission arises from close to the central engine , either as an embedded blazar or associated with the accretion processes .    </S>",
