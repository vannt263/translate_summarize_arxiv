    "the technological advances promised by quantum information processing ( qip ) science require an unprecedented level of control in characterizing , manipulating , and measuring quantum systems @xcite . in reality",
    ", no quantum system may be perfectly isolated from its surrounding environment and available means for control and measurement are unavoidably limited . as a results , deviations from the intended dynamical evolution arise , which are collectively referred to as ` errors ' .",
    "active quantum error correction ( qec ) methods aim to detect and counteract the effects of errors during both quantum storage and processing of information via non - trivial quantum gates @xcite . given limited control resources , accurate quantum computation ( qc ) on an arbitrarily large ( scalable )",
    "qi processor is only possible if qec is implemented fault - tolerantly , that is , more errors is removed than is generated when operations are themselves imperfect .",
    "the theory of fault - tolerant qec ( ftqec ) guarantees that this is possible in principle , provided that the _ error per gate _ ( epg ) is below a minimum threshold @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , while architectures which can tolerate epgs comparable with experimentally achieved values have been proposed @xcite , the corresponding resource overheads remain prohibitive for existing qip test - beds .",
    "thus , qec strategies which can effectively reduce errors _ at the physical level _ are both crucial for boosting control fidelities in current quantum devices and , in the long run , for enabling fault - tolerant qc .    while traditional qec methods achieve information protection by resorting to suitable redundant encodings and non - unitary quantum operations , _ dynamical quantum error correction _ ( dqec ) aims to counteract the effects of decoherence in a quantum system in a purely ` open - loop ' fashion , that is , solely based on suitable unitary ( hamiltonian ) control .",
    "historically , dynamical procedures for effectively removing unwanted couplings and/or evolution by time - dependent ` coherent averaging ' have decades of tradition in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy @xcite , resulting in an unmatched degree of coherent control in liquid - state nuclear - spin qubits @xcite .",
    "in particular , dynamical decoupling ( dd ) sequences in nmr are early examples of dqec for a _ closed _ quantum system , specifically designed to ` time - suspend ' the underlying spin evolution by achieving a net trivial ( identity ) propagator , or noop gate . in the qip context",
    ", dd methods have evolved into a powerful and versatile framework for achieving decoherence suppression in _ non - markovian open _ quantum systems in a variety of control settings @xcite . while recent theoretical developments include the exploitation of randomized design @xcite , and the construction of concatenated @xcite and optimal @xcite dd sequences , the growing practical significance of dqec methods is witnessed by the intense parallel effort in the experimental qip community .",
    "following simple proof - of - principle demonstrations in a single - photon polarization interferometer @xcite , dd in its simplest ( so - called ` bang - bang ' ) form has been successfully implemented by now in solid - state nuclear quadrupole qubits @xcite , fullerene qubits @xcite , coupled electron - nuclear systems @xcite , flying polarization qubits @xcite , and , most recently , trapped ions @xcite .    although the advances mentioned above demonstrate the usefulness of dqec toward removing unwanted decoherence _ in between _ control pulses and achieving a robust noop implementation ,",
    "full - fledged dqec demands that decoherence be removed both _ in between and during _ control pulses , while implementing a robust non - trivial ( non - identity ) quantum gate .",
    "_ dynamically corrected gates _ ( dcgs ) were introduced in ref . precisely to meet this goal . as opposed to readily available ` primitive gates , ' which effect a unitary operation on the system with a ` bare ' epg , each dcg consists of a suitably designated sequence of control inputs in such a way that the desired target transformation is effected with a net reduced epg .",
    "dcgs are inspired by both composite - pulse techniques for reducing classical control errors ( in particular , so - called ` fully compensating ' or ` universal rotation ' sequences ) @xcite as well as strongly - modulating pulses @xcite for high - fidelity ` soft ' pulses in nmr , while differing from either strategy in important ways .",
    "specifically , dgcs compensate for error evolution due to a _ dynamical quantum environment over which neither quantitative knowledge nor direct control is assumed_. although dcg constructions are useful only in the short gating time / weak coupling limit and can not counter stochastic control errors ,",
    "a key advantage is that no extra qubits or measurement capabilities are needed , thanks to the underlying open - loop control design . on the one hand ,",
    "dcgs relate to ongoing effort on improving pulse - shaping methods in order to better accommodate physical constraints and/or increase robustness against different errors .",
    "in particular , dd - inspired constructions for pulses capable to ` self - refocus ' unwanted couplings have been recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "these efforts nonetheless consider a specific control task ( noop implementation ) and/or do not incorporate the effect of generic quantum errors .",
    "dcgs , on the other hand , are applicable to any desired unitary operation , and have the flexibility to handle a generic class of non - markovian error models on qubits .",
    "furthermore , dcgs are designed having high portability in mind , so that they can replace the already available gates whenever appropriate ( mild ) compatibility conditions are met . substituting primitive gates with dcgs can then significantly lower physical epgs , ultimately paving the way for more practical ftqec architectures .    in this paper",
    ", we expand our analysis of dcg constructions with the twofold goal of describing in detail the mathematical groundwork underlying the results of @xcite , as well as further demonstrating the flexibility and potential of dcgs for high - fidelity quantum control in open quantum systems .",

    "@xmath43 to the set of error generators we wish to suppress . for linear decoherence ,",
    "@xmath44 includes arbitrary system - bath operators that induce single - qubit errors on @xmath0 .",

    "we have provided the mathematical and control - theoretic framework for dcgs as introduced in ref . , and further explored their range of applicability . besides examining in full detail the analytical construction of decoherence - protected gates in the prototypical scenario of arbitrary single - qubit errors , a physically motivated setting involving spin - bath decoherence has been characterized through exact numerical simulation .",
    "this has both confirmed the expected performance of dcgs in a wide parameter regime and yielded insight into the interplay of different open - system and control features .",
    "additional challenges arising in the synthesis of dgcs under realistic control assumptions involving drifts and control errors have been laid out , and proof - of - concept solutions constructed in specific representative situations .",
    "our present analysis naturally points to several directions for further investigation .",
    "first , our focus here has been on dcg constructions that cancel errors only up to the first order in magnus expansion . in principle",
    ", it is possible to go beyond the first order dcg constructions and produce even more efficient dqec protocols @xcite . while this will unavoidably involve a higher level of sophistication in the resulting control modulation and/or the computational effort involved in numerical search processes , a clear understanding of relevant complexity properties",
    "is needed .",
    "making contact with the concept of ` quantum control landspace ' as recently proposed for the generation of unitary transformations in closed quantum systems @xcite might prove especially insightful .",
    "second , we only considered a limited set of permissible control hamiltonians for dcg constructions . a general analysis of what we referred to as the ` gate permissibility problem ' for a given open quantum systems is , as mentioned , still lacking .",
    "this generalization appears even more interesting by observing that the set of permissible controls can be directly related to the specific representation of the dd group used in the dcg construction .",
    "in fact , the apparent freedom in the choice of dd representation independently motivates the existence of dqec proposals for the same tasks as dcgs that do not rely upon dd explicitly .",
    "numerical optimization is , in this sense , a compelling option to consider for investigating more general dqec constructions .",
    "lastly , different options exist for incorporating dqec protocols into actual qip architectures .",
    "while we have stressed the potential usefulness of dcgs directly at the _ physical _ level , dcg constructions could potentially be envisioned on top of a _ logical _ encoding , for instance to reduce epgs in silicon double - quantum - dot logical qubits as considered in @xcite .",
    "once an algorithm is specified , whether at the physical or logical level , one may further consider whether to produce the dcg version of each circuit gate , and obtain an error - suppressed algorithm accordingly ; or whether instead to dynamically correct the whole algorithm viewed as a complex unitary transformation . while a thorough understanding of such design issues is fundamental for real - world applications , optimal solutions will ultimately depend on various details and constraints in place and , as such ,",
    "are most effectively addressed in specific contexts .",
    "it is our hope that this work will prompt further interest and investigation in dqec approaches from the qip implementation community .",

    "arbitrary precision matrices turned out to be necessary for the following reasons : ( i ) small errors correspond to toggling - frame error propagators that are close to identity , thus it is essential that any numerical error be much smaller than the physical effect being probed .",
    "( ii ) each matrix multiplication effectively reduces the precision of the calculation by a fixed amount which depends on the dimension of the matrices used .",
