    "let @xmath14 denote a sample of the discrete gaussian free field ( gff ) on @xmath3 pinned to 0 at the origin .",
    "explicitly , @xmath15 is a centered gaussian process such that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the green function in @xmath18 ; i.e. , the expected number of visits to @xmath19 for the simple random walk on @xmath3 started at @xmath20 and killed upon reaching the origin . for @xmath21 and conditional on the sample  @xmath6 of the gff , let @xmath22 be a discrete - time markov chain with transition probabilities given  by @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath25-norm on  @xmath3 .",
    "we will write @xmath26 for the law of the above random walk such that @xmath27 and use  @xmath28 to denote the corresponding expectation .",
    "we also write  @xmath29 for the law of the gff and use  @xmath30 ( as above ) to denote the expectation with respect to  @xmath29 .",
    "the transition kernel  @xmath31 depends only on the differences @xmath32 whose law is , as it turns out , invariant and ergodic with respect to the translates of  @xmath3 .",
    "the markov chain @xmath33 is thus an example of a random walk in a stationary random environment .",
    "the main conclusion we prove about this random walk is then :    [ thm_main_spectral ]    for each  @xmath0 and each @xmath34 , @xmath35 furthermore , @xmath36 is recurrent for @xmath29-almost every @xmath6 .",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath31 are such that the walk prefers to move along the edges where  @xmath6 increases ; the walk is thus driven towards larger values of the field .",
    "this has been predicted ( e.g. , in @xcite ) to result in a subdiffusive behavior .",
    "we prove a version of subdiffusivity for the expected exit time from large balls :    [ thm_main_exit_time ] let @xmath37 denote the first exit time of @xmath38 from @xmath39 ^ 2\\cap{\\mathbb{z}}^2 $ ] . for each  @xmath34",
    ", we then have @xmath40 where @xmath41 4\\gamma/\\gamma_{{\\text{\\rm c}}},\\qquad&\\text{otherwise}. \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    the bounds on the expected hitting time indicate that @xmath42 should scale as @xmath43 for large  @xmath44 .",
    "although we expect this to be true , we have so far only been able to prove a corresponding lower  bound :    [ thm_main_diffusive_exponent ] for @xmath29-almost every  @xmath6 and each  @xmath34 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is as in  .",
    "we note that theorems  [ thm_main_exit_time ] and  [ thm_main_diffusive_exponent ] are consistent with the predictions in @xcite for general log - correlated fields .",
    "in particular , confirms the prediction for the diffusive exponent of the walk from @xcite as a lower bound .",
    "the reason why the bounds in   are not sufficient is that we do not know whether @xmath37 scales with  @xmath10 proportionally to its expectation .",
    "a full proof of subdiffusive behavior thus remains elusive .",
    "the technical approach that makes our analysis possible stems from the following simple rewrite of the transition kernel , @xmath47 this represents @xmath33 as a random walk among random conductances , or a random conductance model to which a large body of literature has been dedicated in recent years ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "an immediate benefit of the rewrite is that the process is now reversible with respect to the measure @xmath48 on  @xmath3 defined by @xmath49 a price to pay is that the conductance @xmath50 of edge @xmath51 now depends on  @xmath6 and not just its gradients , and the law of the conductances is thus not translation invariant .",
    "as it turns out , the change of the behavior of the expected exit time at the critical point @xmath52 ( see theorem  [ thm_main_exit_time ] ) arises , in its entirety , from the asymptotic @xmath53 this is , roughly speaking , because point - to - point effective resistances in the associated random conductance network @xmath54 behave , for points at distance  @xmath10 , as  @xmath13 for every  @xmath0 .",
    "the precise statement is the subject of :    [ thm - effective - resistance ] let us regard @xmath39 ^ 2\\cap{\\mathbb{z}}^2 $ ] as a conductance network where edge @xmath51 has conductance @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath55 denote the effective resistance between  @xmath20 and  @xmath19 in network  @xmath56 .",
    "for each  @xmath0 there are @xmath57 such that @xmath58 holds for each  @xmath59 and each  @xmath60 . moreover , for the corresponding network @xmath54 on all of  @xmath3 , there is a constant @xmath61 such that @xmath62 and , for each  @xmath0 and each  @xmath34 , also @xmath63    the effective resistance and further background on the theory of resistor networks are discussed in detail in section  [ sec : sec_gen_par_ser ] .",

    "the construction of the process was carried out in @xcite , with the associated heat kernel constructed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the spectral dimension ( defined as 2 times the exponent for the return probability computed in almost sure sense with respect to the underlying random environment ) for lbm was computed , and in @xcite some nontrivial bounds for off - diagonal lbm heat kernel were established .",
    "a random walk naturally associated with lbm is the continuous time simple symmetric random walk with exponential holding time at  @xmath72 having parameter @xmath73 where , in our notation , @xmath74 .",
    "a more natural ( albeit qualitatively similar , as far as long - time behavior is concerned ) modification is to use @xmath75 ( see  ) in instead of  @xmath76 ; we will refer to the associated process as the liouville random walk ( lrw ) below .",
    "formally , this process is a continuous - time markov chain on @xmath3 with generator @xmath77.\\ ] ] the nature of the transition rates of the lrw precludes formulation using conductances and , no surprise , our analysis is thus quite different from those mentioned above .",
    "for instance , unlike for the lrw , our random walk moves preferably towards neighbors with a higher potential , emphasizing the trapping effects of the random environment ; see fig .",
    "the off - diagonal heat kernel computation in @xcite is also of a different flavor : our control of the return probability relies crucially on the electric - resistance metric while the off - diagonal lbm heat kernel is expected to be related to the liouville first passage ( liouville fpp ) percolation metric ( see @xcite ) .",
    "notwithstanding the above differences , both the lrw and our random walk share the following fact : @xmath78 defined above is a stationary measure ( conditional on @xmath6 ) for both processes . the same thus applies to any interpolation between the lrw and our random walk ; namely , the continuous - time markov chain with generator @xmath79\\ ] ] for any @xmath80 $ ] . assuming that the scaling limits of these random walks can eventually be extracted",
    ", one may thus obtain a one - parameter family of natural diffusions evolving on the background of a continuum gaussian free field .",
    "another series of related works is on random walks on random planar maps .",
    "this is thanks to the conjectural relation between lqg and random planar maps ( note that part of the conjecture has been established in @xcite ) .",
    "building on ideas from the theory of circle packings  @xcite , the authors of @xcite proved that the uniform infinite planar triangulation and quadrangulation are both almost surely recurrent . in @xcite , it was shown that the random walk on the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation is sub - diffusive , where an upper bound of @xmath81 on the exponent was given while the conjectured exponent is @xmath82 .",
    "as mentioned above , our work relies on estimates of effective resistances , which is a fundamental metric for a graph . recently ,",
    "some other metric properties of gff have been studied , including the pseudo - metric defined via the zero - set of the gff on the metric graph @xcite , the liouville fpp metric @xcite ( which is roughly the graph distance on the network @xmath83 if we regard edge conductances as passage times ) and the chemical distance for the level - set percolation @xcite .",
    "these studies reveal different facets of the metric properties of the gff . in particular , by @xcite and the present paper , we see that putting random weights / conductances as exponential of the gff substantially distorts the graph distance of @xmath2 but has much less of an effect on the resistance metric of  @xmath2 .      in light of the connection between random walks and effective resistances ( see , e.g. , @xcite for some background ) , the principal step ( and the bulk of the paper ) is the proof of theorem  [ thm - effective - resistance ] .",
    "this theorem is proved by a novel combination of planar and electrostatic duality , gaussian concentration inequality and the russo - seymour - welsh theory , as we outline below .",
    "duality considerations for planar electric networks are quire classical .",
    "they invariably boil down to the simple fact that , in a planar network , every harmonic function comes hand - in - hand with its harmonic conjugate .",
    "an example of a duality statement , and a source of inspiration for us , is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 9.4 ) , where it is shown that , for locally - finite planar networks with sufficient connectivity , the wired effective resistance across an edge ( with the edge removed ) is equal to the free effective conductance across the dual edge in the dual network ( with the dual edge removed ) . however , the need to deal with more complex geometric settings steered us to develop a version of duality that is phrased in purely geometric terms .",
    "in particular , we use that , in planar networks with a bounded degree , cutsets can naturally be associated with paths and _ vice versa_.    the starting point of our proofs is thus a representation of the effective resistance , resp . ,",
    "conductance as a variational minimum of the dirichlet energy for _ families _ of paths , resp .",
    ", cutsets .",
    "although these generalize well - known upper bounds on these quantities ( e.g. , the nash - williams estimate ) , we prefer to think of them merely as extensions of the parallel and series law . indeed , the variational characterizations are obtained by replacing individual edges by equivalent collections of new edges , connected either in series or parallel depending on the context , and noting that the said upper bounds become sharp once we allow for optimization over all such replacements .",
    "we refer to propositions  [ prop : fundamental_prop_resistance ] and [ prop : fundamental_prop_conductance ] in section  [ sec : sec_gen_par_ser ] for more details .",
    "another useful fact that we rely on heavily is the symmetry  @xmath84 which implies that the joint laws of the conductances are those of the resistances . using this we can _",
    "almost _ argue that the law of the effective resistance between the left and right boundaries of a square centered at the origin is the same as the law of the effective conductance between the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "the rotation symmetry of  @xmath6 and the ( electrostatic ) duality between the effective conductance and resistance would then imply that the law of the effective resistance through a square is the same as that of its reciprocal value .",
    "combined with a gaussian concentration inequality ( see @xcite ) , this would readily show that , for the square of side  @xmath10 , this effective resistance is typically @xmath13 .",
    "however , some care is needed to make the `` almost duality '' argument work .",
    "in fact , we do not expect an exact duality of the kind valid for critical bond percolation on  @xmath3 to hold in our case .",
    "indeed , such a duality might for instance entail that the law of the conductances on a minimal cutset ( separating , say , two points ) in the primal network is the same as the law of the resistances on the dual path `` cutting through '' this cutset .",
    "although the gffs on a graph and its dual are quite closely related ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we do not see how this property can possibly be true .",
    "notwithstanding , we are more than happy to work with just an approximate duality which , as it turns out , requires only a uniform bound on the _ ratio _ of resistances of neighboring edges .",
    "this ratio would be unmanageably too large if applied the duality argument to the network based on the gff itself .",
    "for this reason , we invoke a decomposition of gff ( see lemma  [ lem : field_decomp_smooth ] ) into a sum of two independent fields , one of which has small variance and the other is a highly smooth field .",
    "we then apply the approximate duality to the network derived from the smooth field , and we argue that the influence from the other field is small since it has small variance .",
    "we have so far explained only how to estimate the effective resistances between the boundaries of a _",
    "square_. however , in order to prove our theorems , we need to estimate effective resistances between vertices , for which a crucial ingredient is an estimate of the effective resistances between the two short boundaries of a _ rectangle_. questions of this type fall into the framework of the russo - seymour - welsh ( rsw ) theory .",
    "this is an important technique in planar statistical physics , initiated in @xcite with the aim to prove uniform positivity of the probability of a crossing of a rectangle in critical bernoulli percolation .",
    "recently , the theory has been adapted to include fk percolation , see e.g. @xcite , and , in @xcite , also voronoi percolation .",
    "in fact , the beautiful method in @xcite is widely applicable to percolation problems satisfying the fkg inequality , mild symmetry assumptions , and weak correlation between well - separated regions .",
    "for example , in @xcite , this method was used to give a simpler proof of the result of @xcite , and in @xcite , a rsw theorem was proved for the crossing probability of level sets of the planar gff .     the current flow realizing ( through thomson s principle ) the effective resistance between two points in the network associated with a sample of the gff in a square of side @xmath85 and  @xmath86 ( left ) and @xmath87 ( right ) .",
    "the source / sink of the current lie on the diagonal of the square ( see the dark spots in the left figure ) .",

    "the source / sink of the current lie on the diagonal of the square ( see the dark spots in the left figure ) .",
    "the intensity of the shade increases with the value of the current . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=42.0% ]    0.0 cm    our rsw proof is _ hugely _ inspired by @xcite , with the novelty of incorporating the ( resistance ) metric rather than merely considering connectivity .",
    "we remark that in a recent work @xcite , a rsw result was established for the liouville fpp metric , again inspired by @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say that the rsw result in the present paper is less complicated than that in @xcite , for the reason that we have the approximate duality in our context which was not available in @xcite .",
    "however , our rsw proof has its own subtlety since , for instance , we need to consider crossings by whole collections of paths simultaneously . the rsw proof is carried out in section  [ sec : rsw ] .",
    "once the effective resistances are under control , we move on to the proof of the results on random walks .",
    "the upper bound on the return probability is proved in section  [ subsec : spectral_dim_upper ] using the methods drawn from @xcite .",
    "the lower bound on the return probability is more subtle as it requires showing that the effective resistivity from @xmath88 to  @xmath19 in @xmath56 is bounded by the sum of the resistances from @xmath88 to  @xmath89 and from  @xmath19 to  @xmath90 ) .",
    "this amounts to bounding a _ difference _ of effective resistances , which is not immediate from the estimates obtained thus far .",
    "we approach this by invoking a concentric decomposition of the gff along a sequence of annuli , which permits representing of the typical value of the resistance as an exponential of a random walk .",
    "the law of the iterated logarithm then shows that the natural fluctuations of the effective resistance ( which are of order @xmath91 ) can be beaten in at least one of the annuli .",
    "these key steps are the content of proposition  [ prop-5.8 ] and lemma  [ lemma-5.11 ] . as an immediate consequence ,",
    "we then get recurrence and , in fact , also the bounds in theorem  [ thm - effective - resistance ] .",
    "voltage profiles for the same geometric setting as in fig .  1 but for two different samples of gff at @xmath92 ( left ) and @xmath87 ( right ) .",
    "notice that the profile represents the probability that a random walk hits the highest point before hitting the lowest point in this graph.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] -8 mm    0.0 cm      we feel that our method of estimating effective resistances provides a novel framework which may have applications in other planar random media .",
    "in fact , from our proofs we should be able to see that our method can be adapted to some other log - correlated gaussian fields such as those considered in @xcite .",
    "we refrain ourselves from doing so , for the reason that we do not yet know how to characterize the class of log - correlated gaussian fields with subpolynomial ( i.e. , @xmath13-like ) growth of the effective resistances .",
    "one important , and perhaps less conspicuous , ingredient of our proofs is the estimate of the effective resistance by means of the gaussian concentration inequality .",
    "when the underlying random media is not a function of a gaussian process , a derivation of such a concentration inequality seems to be a challenge .",
    "a natural class of non - gaussian models where one should try to prove an analogue of theorem  [ thm - effective - resistance ] is that of gradient fields with uniformly convex interactions .",
    "indeed , there the required concentration is implied by the brascamp - lieb inequality .",
    "concerning our future goals for the problem at hand , our first attempt will aim at the computation of the spectral dimension ( which amounts to an almost sure version of ) and an upper bound on the diffusive exponent matching the lower bound in theorem  [ thm_main_diffusive_exponent ] .",
    "our ultimate goal is to prove existence of an appropriate scaling limit of the whole problem .",
    "this applies not only to the walk itself , but also to the resistance metric as well as the associated current and voltage configurations ; see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] for illustrations .",
    "we wish to thank takashi kumagai , hubert lacoin , rmi rhodes , steve lalley , vincent vargas and ofer zeitouni for helpful discussions .",
    "as noted above , our asymptotic statements on the random walk hinge on estimates of effective resistance between various sets in  @xmath3 .",
    "these will in turn rely crucially on a certain duality between the effective resistance and the effective conductance which will itself be based on the distributional equality of  @xmath6 with  @xmath93 .",
    "the exposition of our proofs thus starts with general versions of these duality statements .",
    "these can be viewed as refinements of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 9.4 ) and are therefore of general interest as well .",
