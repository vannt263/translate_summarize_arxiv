    "in the field of electromagnetic optics , the past fifteen years have seen the emergence of new and astounding concepts directly connected with the potential availability of artificial materials , such as nano - engineered materials @xcite or photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "these metamaterials are rationally designed to exhibit unprecedented optical properties like negative @xcite or zero @xcite index of refraction , which create ways to achieve innovative functionalities unattainable with natural materials , as the perfect flat lens @xcite or the invisibility cloak @xcite .    beside the first preliminary experimental demonstrations of these new and exciting concepts ,",
    "the thin - film community was used to play with tailored `` arbitrary indices in the complex plane '' and to build complex optical functions based on their use : the implementation of the admittance formalism @xcite was the main mathematical tool to allow for such tailoring . however , despite this favorable context , negative indices have not really been disseminated within this community .    the main objective of this work is to help rectify this situation , by adapting the concept of negative index to the admittance theory , and then by using this extended formalism to analyze the optical properties of some standard multilayer stacks , like the quarter - wavelength bragg mirror , the fabry - perot bandpass filter , or the antireflection coating , where one or more layers of these stacks involve negative index materials ( nims ) .",
    "in general , the refractive index of a medium at a frequency @xmath0 is given from maxwell s equations by the following relation @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fourier transforms of the temporal electric permittivity @xmath4 and magnetic permeability @xmath5 of the medium , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the electromagnetic properties of vacuum .",
    "equation ( [ eq : refractiveindex ] ) is valid for linear and isotropic media , and the fourier transform involves an exponential in the form @xmath8 .",
    "these frequency dependent quantities are complex , hence the refractive index @xmath9 is not a well - defined single - valued function .",
    "therefore , the computation of the square root of @xmath10 requires the choice of a branch ( also called a riemann sheet @xcite ) , that is a portion of its range over which this function is single - valued . for the square root function ,",
    "the two possible principal values differ only by their signs .",
    "although the choice of this sign for the refractive index of left - handed metamaterials has been a subject of controversy @xcite , all the proposed approaches provide identical conclusions for media that are both negatively refracting and nonamplifying .",
    "as shown in next paragraphs , the choice of the negative sign leads to conditions ( on the permittivity and permeability ) derived from maxwell s equation s and causality .",
    "a first set of relations is @xmath11 where prime and double prime denote the real and imaginary parts of each complex quantity , respectively .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : dissipativerequirement ] ) is simply the dissipative requirement corresponding to an absorbing or transparent medium . as to the relation ( [ eq : amplitudedecay ] ) , it plays a vital role since , as shown hereafter , it ensures that a plane wave decays in amplitude as it propagates in a dissipative nim medium .",
    "finally , in the low - loss regime , the combination of these relations yields the well - known conditions @xmath12    in order to understand the link between these last two relations and the wave amplitude decay in a nim medium , we first compute the square roots of a complex number @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) by using the following general formula @xcite @xmath15_{\\pm}=\\pm\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{|z|+x}{2}}+i\\thinspace\\text{sgn}(y)\\sqrt{\\frac{|z|-x}{2}}\\right ] \\label{eq : complexsquareroot}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 corresponds to the sign of the imaginary part @xmath17 . then , by introducing the real and imaginary parts of each quantity in equation ( [ eq : refractiveindex ] ) , we infer @xmath18 and thus , for the refractive index @xmath9 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 for a plane wave propagating in the positive @xmath13 direction in a nim medium , the phase and amplitude changes are driven by an exponential in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the modulus of the wave - vector in vacuum .    thus , for a nim medium ( @xmath24 ) , we must choose the minus sign in the general square root formula ( [ eq : complexsquareroot ] ) , while the decay of the wave amplitude during the propagation imposes that the condition that @xmath25 be positive or equal to zero , which leads to @xmath26 moreover , in the low - loss regime , we can write , as a first approximation @xmath27 if the product @xmath28 was negative , @xmath29 would be negative too , following ( [ eq : dissipativerequirement ] ) and ( [ eq : xy ] ) , and @xmath30 would be equal to zero , in accordance with ( [ eq : nprimendoubleprime ] ) taken at the same level of approximation .",
    "this means that the product @xmath28 must be positive : the two real parts @xmath31 and @xmath32 are thus of the same sign , and from conditions ( [ eq : dissipativerequirement ] ) and ( [ eq : amplitudedecay ] ) , we can conclude that they are simultaneously negative , see ( [ eq : nim ] ) , whereas the refractive index @xmath9 is given , in the same low - loss regime , by @xcite @xmath33",
    "let us now consider a multilayer stack deposited at the surface of a plane substrate and illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave at an angle of incidence ( aoi ) @xmath34 .",
    "at any position within the stack , the tangential component of the magnetic field @xmath35 and the cross product between the normal to the substrate @xmath36 and the tangential component of the electric field @xmath37 are parallel @xcite .",
    "the algebraic ratio of these quantities is called the complex admittance @xmath38 . hence @xmath39",
    "if we are able to compute the complex admittance @xmath40 of the entire stack , we can easily determine the amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath41 of the plane wave on the stack by using the formula @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the effective index of the incident medium , i.e. the proportionality factor between the same vectors as previously stated , but for the incoming plane wave .",
    "the computation of the @xmath40 factor is based on the application of a recursive formula linking the admittances at two consecutive boundaries @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the layer number , @xmath46 its effective index and @xmath47 the phase delay introduced by the crossing of this layer .",
    "the initialization of this recursive formula is made in the substrate where only the outgoing plane wave is present @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total number of layers in the stack and @xmath50 the effective index of the substrate .",
    "therefore , to define the optical properties of a multilayer stack including a negative index material , we first need to determine the * effective index * @xmath51 of this artificial material , and then the * phase delay * @xmath52 associated with the crossing of a layer thickness @xmath53 .      in general ,",
    "the effective indices of a medium are given by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is defined by @xmath56    if we first consider the propagation of a plane wave within a transparent positive index material ( pim ) , we have @xmath57 and then @xmath58 for a plane wave passing through a multilayer stack , @xmath59 is an invariant while @xmath55 depends on the layer medium .",
    "therefore , the effective indices of a pim medium are defined by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the vacuum impedance .    for a negative index material illuminated by a plane wave at an angle of incidence @xmath34 , relation ( [ eq : alpha2 ] )",
    "becomes @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the refractive index of the incident medium . to compute @xmath55",
    ", we again need to obtain the square root of a complex number whose real and imaginary parts in this case are defined by @xmath64=(\\epsilon_r'\\mu_r'-n_0 ^ 2\\sin^2\\theta_0)-\\epsilon_r''\\mu_r''\\\\ & \\im\\left[\\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\omega^2\\epsilon_0\\mu_0}\\right]=\\epsilon_r'\\mu_r''+\\epsilon_r''\\mu_r ' \\label{eq : xyalpha } \\end{aligned } \\right.\\ ] ] to apply here an approach strictly identical to the one detailed in section [ sec : negativeindexofrefraction ] for a nim medium in the low - loss regime , we need to satisfy an additional condition @xmath65 which allows us to give an approximate expression for @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath66 moreover , in the transparency regime ( @xmath67 ) , relation ( [ eq : additionalcondition ] ) can be rewritten as a _ propagating condition _ @xmath68 and the effective indices of the nim medium are thus given by @xmath69    the effective indices of a transparent nim layer ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) are then * positive * in the _ propagating mode_.    besides from that , by using the invariance of @xmath59 , we can replace in ( [ eq : nimeffectiveindices ] ) @xmath72 by @xmath73 to obtain @xmath74 the relations defining the effective indices of a nim layer are thus seen to be identical to those obtained for the effective indices of a pim layer .      making use of the results from the previous section , we can easily compute a general expression for the phase delay @xmath52 associated with a nim layer thickness @xmath53 in the _ propagating mode _ of the transparency regime @xmath75 using the same approach as in section [ sec : nimeffectiveindices ] ( replacement of @xmath72 by @xmath73 ) , we can rewrite relation ( [ eq : deltanim ] ) in the form @xmath76      let us consider a transparent nim layer and a standard positive index material ( pim ) whose electromagnetic properties ( relative electric permittivity and relative magnetic permeability ) are equal and opposite to the nim ones @xmath77 in the propagating mode of the transparency regime , one can write @xmath78 this last equation shows that we can simulate the properties of a nim layer by replacing it with an equivalent pim layer , provided that we use for this pim layer a * virtual * thickness * opposite * to that of the nim layer ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we now call this layer the correlated pim _ mirror image _",
    "( pimmi ) of the nim layer .",
    "this property is essential because it allows us to use standard thin - film software to predict , in the propagating mode , the optical properties of interference coatings including one or more nim layers .",
    "before we can systematically investigate the reflection and transmission of a plane wave by multilayer thin films containing both positively and negatively refracting materials , we start by analyzing the specific case of the _ perfect lens _ @xcite with the help of the admittance formalism detailed in the previous section",
    ".    a perfect lens can be described as a slab ( in other words a single layer ) of -1 index material with @xmath80 and surrounded by air ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) . at any aoi @xmath34 , we have @xmath83 and then following ( [ eq : recurrencerelation ] ) @xmath84 regardless of the slab thickness @xmath85 .",
    "this implies that the reflection coefficient @xmath41 is equal to zero at any angle of incidence and state of polarization ( sop ) , while the law of conservation of the spatial pulsation takes the form @xmath86 which imposes : @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "thanks to the admittance formalism , we also recover very easily two of the three fundamental properties of the _ perfect lens _ , i.e. its antireflection behavior and its imaging ability . details of the third fundamental property ( evanescent wave amplification @xcite ) are not required to understand the optical properties of multilayer optics in the propagating mode ; thus they are not discussed here .",
    "in this work , we consider ideal negative index materials , i.e. * without absorption and spectral dispersion * , and above all , without any restriction on the choice of nim electromagnetic properties .",
    "moreover , in this section , all the computations are made in the propagating mode , and thus , all the effective indices and phase delays are real .",
    "let us consider an all - nim multilayer stack ( refractive index @xmath89 , physical thickness @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) deposited on the surface of a pim semi - infinite substrate ( refractive index @xmath92 ) .",
    "the complex admittance @xmath93 of this all - nim stack can be computed with the recursive formula ( [ eq : recurrencerelation ] ) and the initialization condition ( [ eq : recurrenceinitialization ] ) @xmath94 as stressed in section [ sec : pimmirrorimage ] , we can replace each nim layer number by its correlated pim mirror image ( refractive index @xmath95 , physical thickness @xmath96 , @xmath91 ) and write @xmath97^*\\ ] ] @xmath98^*\\cos\\delta_{p-1}+i\\tilde{n}_{p-1}\\sin\\delta_{p-1}}{\\cos\\delta_{p-1}+i([y_{p-1}^{\\text{pim}}]^*/\\tilde{n}_{p-1})\\sin\\delta_{p-1}}\\\\ & = [ y_{p-2}^{\\text{pim}}]^ * \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath99 @xmath100^*\\cos\\delta_1+i\\tilde{n}_1\\sin\\delta_1}{\\cos\\delta_1+i([y_1^{\\text{pim}}]^*/\\tilde{n}_1)\\sin\\delta_1}=[y_{0}^{\\text{pim}}]^*\\ ] ] where @xmath101 are the complex admittances of the correlated classical all - pim multilayer stack ( refractive index @xmath95 , physical thickness @xmath90 ) .    as a consequence @xmath102^*}{\\tilde{n}_0+[y_{0}^{\\text{pim}}]^*}=r_{\\text{pim}}^*\\ ] ] which means that the only difference between an all - nim multilayer configuration and the corresponding all - pim one is a sign change in the phase of the reflection coefficient .",
    "therefore , the use of all - nim stacks does not provide any effective benefit with respect to the related all - pim configurations .",
    "let us consider a standard quarter - wavelength mirror including seven high and low index alternated layers deposited on a semi - infinite glass substrate ( @xmath103 ) with air as the incident medium ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this stack can be described by the following synthetic formula    air / hlhlhlh / glass    where h ( respectively l ) is a high - index ( respectively low - index ) quarter - wavelength layer at the central wavelength of the mirror .",
    "for our simulations , we choose @xmath105 nm as the design wavelength , silica ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) as the low index material , and tantalum pentoxide ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) as the high index material .",

    "however the spectral properties of these three configurations are not exactly identical , and , in order to highlight their differences , we have summarized in table [ tab : comparisonfp ] , for each fp configuration , the values of the two parameters introduced in the previous section , i.e. the filter bandwidth @xmath122 ( fwhm ) and the maximum rejection level @xmath123 in the stopband .",

    "the same approach ( minimizing the spectral dependence of the overall round trip phase @xmath124 ) can be used to design a kind of _ white _ fabry - perot cavity , i.e. a multilayer cavity that spontaneously exhibits a resonant behavior over a very large spectral range .",
    "the description of this optimization scheme exceeds the frame of this paper and will be described further in a dedicated article @xcite .",
    "we restrict our study to single - layer and double - layer antireflection stacks providing zero reflectance at a given design wavelength ( here 600 nm ) and normal incidence .",
    "theoretical analyses using admittance formalism @xcite shows that we have only two possible configurations    * a single - layer solution ( 1a ) whose refractive index and optical thickness are imposed ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 at the design wavelength ) , or * a double - layer solution for which the phase delays of both layers must satisfy the following set of equations @xmath127 in this case , we can either choose the same low - index and high - index materials as above , i.e. @xmath106 ( @xmath128 ) and @xmath108 ( @xmath129 ) and thereby define two different solutions following the sign of @xmath130 + solution 2a : air / 1.312l 0.317h / glass + solution 2b : air / 0.688l 1.683h / glass + or we can impose that the optical thicknesses of both layers be equal to @xmath131 , which leads to the following relation @xmath132 if we use silica for the top layer ( @xmath128 ) , the refractive index @xmath133 of the bottom layer will be equal to 1.825 , the formula of the corresponding stack being simply given in this case by + solution 2c : air / l h / glass    the figure [ fig : arpimlambda ] shows the spectral dependence of the reflectance @xmath110 of the single - layer solution ( 1a ) as well as the three double - layer solutions ( 2a , 2b and 2c ) at zero aoi .",
    "clearly the single - layer solution is the best one in terms of behavior throughout the spectral range .          in accordance with the conclusion of section [ sec : allpim ] , we do not need to analyze the optical properties of all - nim antireflection coatings , because the spectral dependence of their reflectance @xmath134 would be identical to those shown in fig .",
