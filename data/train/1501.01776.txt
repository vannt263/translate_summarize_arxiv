    "conformal symmetry plays a considerable role both in high energy and condensed matter physics .",
    "there has been a renewed interest in recent years , particularly because of the ads / cft conjecture @xcite and the successful use of conformal methods in three - dimensional critical physics @xcite .",
    "the groundbreaking papers of the 1970s and 1980s @xcite solved two fundamental issues in two dimensions : first , scale invariance implies conformal invariance under mild assumptions @xcite and , second , conformal symmetry enables us to solve most of the scale invariant problems that is , to determine critical exponents and correlation functions @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient for the exact solution of two - dimensional conformal models is the existence of an infinite number of generators of the conformal group . in higher dimensions , the number of generators is finite , and we could naively conclude that symmetry arguments alone are not sufficient to solve a model in the critical regime",
    ". however , it is well - known that scale - invariant theories are in a one - to - one correspondence with the fixed points of the wilson renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite , and that the fixed point of a theory completely determines all the correlation functions of a critical model for sufficiently small wavenumbers . therefore , at the level of principles , scale ( and _ a fortiori _ conformal ) invariance is sufficient to determine all the universal critical properties of a model .",
    "of course , in practice , the computation of these critical properties requires us to solve the functional wilson rg equations .",
    "this is a formidable task that we do not know how to carry out without approximations .",
    "any supplementary information , even if redundant , is therefore welcome and this is what conformal invariance could provide .",
    "a breakthrough in this direction has been achieved these last years with the conformal bootstrap program @xcite , which led to the _ exact _ ( although numerical ) computation of the critical exponents of the ising model in three dimensions assuming , among other things , conformal invariance .    in parallel ,",
    "a large activity has been devoted to understanding the relation between scale and conformal invariance in  or close to  four dimensions .",
    "it has been proven to all orders of perturbation theory that scale invariance implies conformal invariance @xcite in four - dimensional unitary and poincar invariant theories .",
    "moreover , there are strong indications that a non - perturbative proof could be at reach in this dimension @xcite .    despite decades of effort",
    ", it is still an open question to know whether a typical statistical model is conformally invariant at criticality in three dimensions .",
    "the aim of this article is twofold .",
    "first , we derive a sufficient condition which , when fulfilled , ensures that scale invariance implies conformal invariance . in the second part of the paper , we prove that this condition is fulfilled in any dimension for the euclidean @xmath1 model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec_nprg ] , we make a brief review of the nonperturbative renormalization - group .",
    "we then recall in sect .",
    "[ sec_scale ] the relation between scale invariance and the nprg . by using the same methods",
    ", we generalize these considerations to the case of conformal invariance in sect .",
    "[ sec_conformal ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec_sufficient ] , we finally derive a sufficient condition for the validity of conformal invariance in scale invariant models",
    ". we show , on general arguments that this condition is expected to be fulfilled in o(@xmath2 ) models ( and in generalizations thereof ) . in sect",
    "[ sec_proof ] , these considerations are made rigourous for the ising universality class .",
    "we give our conclusions in sect  [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "the proof of conformal invariance in all dimensions presented below is intimately related to the deep structure of the wilson rg and scale invariance .",
    "we therefore start by recalling , in the case of the @xmath1 model , the formalism of the modern formulations ( sometimes called nonperturbative rg , or functional rg ) of the wilson rg @xcite .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure at some rg scale @xmath3 is implemented by smoothly decoupling the long - wavelength modes @xmath4 of the system , also called the slow modes , by giving them a large mass , while keeping unchanged the dynamics of the short - wavelength / rapid ones @xmath5 .",
    "this decoupling is conveniently implemented by modifying the action or the hamiltonian of the model : @xmath6\\to s[\\varphi]+ \\delta s_k[\\varphi]$ ] where @xmath7 $ ] is quadratic in the field and reads , in fourier space , @xmath7=1/2 \\int_q\\ , r_k(q^2)\\varphi(q ) \\varphi(-q)$ ] . the precise shape of @xmath8 does not matter for what follows as long as it can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the field renormalization factor and @xmath11 is a function that , ( i ) falls off rapidly to 0 for @xmath12  the rapid modes @xmath5 are not affected by @xmath13  and ( ii ) goes to a constant for @xmath14  the slow modes @xmath4 acquire a mass of order @xmath3 and thus smoothly decouple .",
    "the partition function , which now depends on the rg parameter @xmath3 , reads : @xmath15=\\int { \\mathcal d}\\varphi\\ , \\exp\\left(- s[\\varphi]- \\delta s_k[\\varphi ] + \\int_x j\\varphi\\right)\\ ] ] where the field @xmath16 is a source term which corresponds to the magnetic field in the ising model and where the ultra - violet ( uv ) regime of the functional integral is assumed to be regularized at a momentum scale @xmath17 , see for instance @xcite for a lattice regularization in this formalism .",
    "it is convenient to define the free energy @xmath18=",
    "\\ln{\\cal z}_k[j]$ ] and its ( slightly modified ) legendre transform by @xmath19+{\\cal w}_k[j]= \\int_x j\\phi -\\frac 1 2 \\int_{xy } r_k(\\vert x - y\\vert)\\,\\phi(x)\\phi(y),\\ ] ] with @xmath20 , @xmath21 the inverse fourier transform of @xmath22 and where the last term has been added for the following reason .",
    "when @xmath3 is close to @xmath17 , all modes are completely frozen by the @xmath13 term because , for all @xmath23 , @xmath24 is very large .",
    "thus , @xmath25 can be computed by the saddle - point method and it is then straightforward to show that the presence of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq_legendre ] ) leads to @xmath26\\simeq s[\\varphi=\\phi ] $ ] . on the contrary , when @xmath27",
    ", the definition of @xmath28 implies that @xmath29 and the original model is recovered : @xmath30= { \\cal z}[j]$ ] and @xmath31=\\gamma[\\phi]$ ] , with @xmath32 $ ] the usual gibbs free energy or generating functional of one - particle - irreducible correlation functions .",
    "the exact rg equation for @xmath33 reads @xcite : @xmath34=\\frac 1 2 \\int_{xy } \\partial_t r_k(\\vert x - y\\vert)g_{k , x y}[\\phi],\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 $ ] is the field - dependent propagator : @xmath37= \\frac{\\delta^2\\gamma_k[\\phi]}{\\delta\\phi(x)\\,\\delta\\phi(y)}.\\ ] ]",
    "we now discuss how scale invariance emerges in the nprg formalism .",
    "we first consider a scale - invariant model described by an action @xmath38 . as we discuss in the following ,",
    "the existence of such a model is not necessary for our proof but it is convenient to imagine that it exists to motivate the form of the expected ward identity ( wi ) of scale invariance .",
    "if such a model existed , this wi would be obtained by performing the following infinitesimal change of variables @xmath39 in the functional integral , with @xmath40 the scaling dimension of the field , usually written in terms of the anomalous dimension @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",
    "actually , the analysis of this model and of its wi faces both uv and infrared ( ir ) problems . in the ir regime ,",
    "non - analyticities are present and , in the uv , it is difficult to control mathematically the continuum limit : @xmath43",
    ". let us first discuss the ir aspect .",
    "since @xmath44 $ ] acts as an ir regulator , the wilson rg offers a solution to the ir problem : the regularized model , eq .",
    "( [ eq_part ] ) , is not scale invariant even if the original model associated with @xmath38 were and , thus , all @xmath45 are regular contrarily to @xmath46 .",
    "the price to pay for regularity is the breaking of scale invariance that manifests itself through a modification of the wi [ see @xcite for situations where @xmath28 breaks symmetries ] . by enlarging the space of cutoff functions",
    "@xmath28 to arbitrary functions @xmath47 that are neither constrained to satisfy ( [ cutoff - rg ] ) nor to be invariant under rotations and translations [ as also done in @xcite ] , this modified wi for scale invariance , obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_part],[eq_legendre ] ) , reads @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the scaling dimension of @xmath28 which implies that the field renormalization in eq .",
    "( [ cutoff - rg ] ) behaves as @xmath51 . by constraining @xmath52 to be of the form ( [ cutoff - rg ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ idwardmoddilat - r ] ) can be conveniently rewritten ( following  @xcite ) : @xmath53=-\\int_{x } ( d^x + d_\\phi)\\phi(x)\\,\\frac{\\delta \\gamma_k[\\phi]}{\\delta \\phi(x)}.\\ ] ] introducing dimensionless and renormalized quantities ( denoted with a tilde ) @xmath54&=\\gamma_k[\\phi ]   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",

    "( [ idwardmoddilat2 ] ) means that an hypothetical scale - invariant action @xmath38 would lead , in its regularized and _ not _ scale - invariant version @xmath56 , to a rg flow where @xmath57 $ ] would be at a fixed point @xmath58 $ ] for all values of @xmath59 : @xmath60=0 $ ] .",
    "the very structure of the wilson rg ( or nprg ) also solves the uv problem .",
    "actual models have a natural uv cutoff @xmath17 ( e.g. a lattice spacing ) at which is defined their microscopic action @xmath61 . the momentum integrals are therefore cut - off at @xmath17 and are thus uv finite . at scales of order @xmath17 ( i.e. , if we consider correlation functions , in the regime where at least one external momentum or @xmath3 or the magnetic field in appropriate units , is of the order of @xmath17 ) , the model is not scale invariant .",
    "in fact scale invariance is an emergent property that appears in the ir when some parameter ( such as the temperature ) has been fine - tuned .",
    "we call @xmath62 the corresponding action . in the rg formalism ,",
    "scale invariance emerges in the ir regime when integrating the rg flow starting at @xmath63= s_{\\rm crit}[\\varphi=\\phi ] $ ] because @xmath64 gets close to a fixed point for large negative @xmath59 , that is , @xmath65 .",
    "as discussed above , the fixed - point condition coincides with the wi for scale invariance in presence of a regulator , see eqs .",
    "( [ idwardmoddilat],[idwardmoddilat2 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "if the rg flow is attracted towards an ir fixed - point , then scale invariance emerges in the universal , long - distance regime .. it is only around the fixed point that @xmath66 approaches a fixed - point value which is nothing else than @xmath41 . ]",
    "we stress that this discussion does not rely on the actual existence of a well - defined continuum limit associated with a scale - invariant action @xmath38 which is , _ per se _ , an interesting issue , but that we do not need to address in the present work .    when the microscopic action is slightly different from the critical one ( e.g. choosing a temperature slightly away from the critical one ) , the rg trajectory approaches the fixed point and then stays close to it for a long rg `` time '' , before departing .",
    "in this situation , the correlation length @xmath67 is finite but large and the wi is almost fulfilled for momenta @xmath68 .",
    "this defines the critical regime of the theory .",
    "the closer the microscopic action is tuned to the critical one , the larger the correlation length @xmath67 , and the better the wi is fulfilled .",
    "let us now make two comments .",
    "first , when @xmath69 , @xmath70 $ ] becomes negligible compared to any @xmath3-independent finite scale and @xmath71 . in this",
    "limit , eqs .",
    "( [ idwardmoddilat],[idwardmoddilat2 ] ) become the usual wi of scale invariance , as expected .",
    "second , the above analysis shows that among the continuous infinity of solutions of the fixed point equation @xmath72=0 $ ] , only those that are regular for all fields are acceptable since they must be the limit when @xmath73 of the smooth evolution of @xmath74 $ ] from @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "there is generically only a discrete , often finite , number of such physical fixed - points .",
    "model in @xmath76 @xcite and the discrete infinity of ( multicritical ) @xmath77-invariant fixed points in @xmath76 @xcite . ]",
    "a characteristic feature of the physical fixed - points is that the linearized flow around them has a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues from which some critical exponents can be straightforwardly obtained @xcite .",
    "the discrete character of the eigenperturbations around a fixed point has been studied intensively by perturbative means .",
    "as for the wilson rg , it has been studied in detail in the particular case of the o@xmath78 models in @xcite .",
    "although obtained within the derivative expansion of the exact rg flow ( [ eqnprg ] ) , its discrete character certainly remains true beyond this approximation .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath79 are obtained from the flow by substituting @xmath74\\to \\tilde\\gamma^*[\\tilde\\phi ] + \\epsilon\\ , \\exp(\\lambda t)\\tilde\\gamma[\\tilde\\phi]$ ] and retaining only the @xmath80 terms .",
    "( with our definition of @xmath59 , a relevant operator has a negative eigenvalue . )",

    "let us now study conformal invariance by following the same method as above .",

    "we put aside for now the problem of the existence of this model since , as discussed below , we do not need that it actually exists for our proof .",

    "this density only depends on the field and its derivatives .",
    "this proof generalizes trivially to other scalar models .",

    "it would then prove useful to approach the problem by computing the scaling behavior of vector operators by monte - carlo simulations .",
    "another promising line of investigation consists in making use of the conformal invariance in the wilson framework to perform actual calculations of universal quantities . on the one hand , and in the best case , this would lead to closed and numerically tractable equations for the critical exponents . on the other hand , the approximation schemes currently used for solving the wilson rg flow equation being incompatible with exact conformal invariance , we can expect that constraining them to be conformally invariant at the fixed point would improve their accuracy .",

    "@xmath228 is a functional of @xmath229 and not of @xmath89 ; it is built from @xmath33 and not from @xmath61 ; what matters is that its density vanishes up to a surface term and not that it is conserved .",
    "moreover , as we already explained , we only deal with a regularized theory which enables us to consider only the analytic candidates for @xmath230 contrary to what should be done in a nonregularized theory . in any case , a clarification of the relation between the two approaches would be welcome . in this respect ,",
