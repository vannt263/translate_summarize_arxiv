    "an @xmath1 real matrix @xmath2 is _ diagonally dominant _ if @xmath3 irreducible , diagonally dominant matrices are always invertible , and such matrices arise often in theory and applications . as a recent example , the work of spielman and teng @xcite gives algorithms to solve symmetric , diagonally dominant linear systems in nearly - linear time in the input size , a fundamental advance in algorithmic complexity theory and numerical computation .",
    "these systems are important since they arise naturally in many practical applications of linear algebra to graph theory @xcite . in this paper , we study mathematical properties of the inverse and determinant of symmetric diagonally dominant matrices that have only positive entries .    by far ,",
    "the most useful information about the inverses of such matrices in applications are bounds on their norms , so we discuss these properties first . a classical result of varah  @xcite states that if @xmath2 is _ strictly diagonally dominant _ , i.e. if @xmath4 for @xmath5 , then the inverse of @xmath2 satisfies the bound : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the maximum absolute row sum of a matrix , which is the matrix norm induced by the infinity norm @xmath8 on vectors in @xmath9 .",
    "generalizations of this basic estimate can be found in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite , but all involve the quantity @xmath10 . in practice",
    ", however , one sometimes requires bounds when @xmath11 for some @xmath12 , in which case the estimates appearing in  @xcite do not apply .",
    "a particularly interesting case is when @xmath11 for all @xmath12 ; we call such matrices _ diagonally balanced_.    we prove a tight bound on @xmath13 for symmetric diagonally dominant @xmath2 with positive entries that is independent of the quantities @xmath14 , and thus also of the maximum entry of @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the diagonally balanced matrix whose off - diagonal entries are all equal to @xmath16 , and recall the _ loewner partial ordering _ on symmetric matrices : @xmath17 means that @xmath18 is positive semidefinite .",
    "we shall also write @xmath19 if @xmath18 is a nonnegative matrix . in lemma  [ lem : eigbalanced ]",
    "below , we show that if @xmath20 and @xmath2 is a symmetric diagonally dominant matrix satisfying @xmath21 , then @xmath22 ; in particular , @xmath2 is invertible . throughout this paper ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the @xmath25 identity matrix and the @xmath26-dimensional column vector consisting of all ones , respectively .",
    "we also write @xmath27 and @xmath28 if the dimension @xmath26 is understood .",
    "the following is our first main result .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath29 .",
    "for any symmetric diagonally dominant matrix @xmath2 with @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 moreover , equality is achieved if and only if @xmath32 .    [ ex : nonsym ] theorem  [ thm : main ] fails to hold if we relax the assumption that @xmath2 be symmetric . for @xmath33 , consider the following diagonally balanced matrices and their inverses : @xmath34 we have @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "in other words , the map @xmath37 over the ( translated ) cone of symmetric diagonally dominant matrices @xmath21 is maximized uniquely at the point of the cone ; i.e. , when @xmath32 .",
    "if the off - diagonal entries of @xmath2 are bounded above by @xmath38 and the largest of the diagonal dominances @xmath14 is @xmath39 , we also have the trivial lower bound : @xmath40 which follows from submultiplicativity of the matrix norm @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath42 is tightly constrained for bounded @xmath43 and @xmath39 .",
    "we now probe some of the difficulty of theorem [ thm : main ] by first deriving an estimate using standard bounds in matrix analysis .",
    "the relation @xmath44 is equivalent to @xmath45  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary  7.7.4 ) , and therefore by a basic inequality  ( * ? ? ?",
    "14 ) , we have @xmath46 for any unitarily invariant matrix norm @xmath47 , such as the spectral @xmath48 , frobenius , or ky - fan norms .",
    "it follows , for instance , that @xmath49 however , this bound is @xmath50 , whereas the bound given in theorem  [ thm : main ] is @xmath51 . in some applications",
    "this difference can be crucial .",
    "for instance , we explain in section [ sec : app ] how theorem  [ thm : main ] proves the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator for some random graph distributions inspired by neuroscience @xcite .",
    "another standard approach to proving norm estimates such as the one in theorem  [ thm : main ] is a perturbation analysis .",
    "more specifically , given a symmetric diagonally dominant @xmath2 with entries bounded below by @xmath52 , one tries to replace each entry @xmath53 by @xmath52 and prove that the norm of the inverse of the resulting matrix is larger .",
    "however , such a method will not succeed , even in the balanced case , as the following examples demonstrate .",
    "consider the following two balanced matrices : @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is obtained from @xmath2 by changing its @xmath56-entry to @xmath16 and then keeping the resulting matrix balanced .",
    "a direct computation shows that @xmath57 . as another example , the following two matrices : @xmath58 also have @xmath57 . here , the @xmath56-entry was changed _ without _ keeping the matrix balanced .",
    "we next describe an interesting special case revealing some surprising combinatorics underlying theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "let @xmath59 be a symmetric diagonally dominant matrix with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "each such matrix @xmath59 is a _",
    "signless laplacian _ of an undirected , unweighted graph @xmath62 , possibly with self - loops . the limits @xmath63 form special cases of theorem [ thm : main ] , and we compute them explicitly in section  [ sec : infinity ] . as we shall see , they are an essential calculation for our proof .",
    "the matrices @xmath64 are determined by the bipartition structure of the connected components of @xmath62 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath62 is connected and not bipartite , the limit ( [ eqn : nlim ] ) is the zero matrix ( see corollary  [ thm : blockconstants ] ) .",
    "example [ ex : graphs ] and figure [ fig_graph_limits ] below contain more interesting cases .",
    "for some recent work on the general eigenstructure of signless laplacians , we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein .    [",
    "ex : graphs ] consider the chain graph @xmath62 with edges @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 . if @xmath26 is odd then @xmath68 since @xmath62 is not bipartite , while if @xmath26 is even , the limit @xmath64 has alternating entries : @xmath69 as another example , consider the star graph @xmath62 , which has edges @xmath70 for @xmath71 . in this case ,    & & n_1i = n_i1 = - , i = 2,  ,n ; n_ij = , . & &    we next describe our second collection of main results concerning the determinant and adjugate of positive , diagonally dominant symmetric matrices @xmath2 . recall the formula : @xmath72 in which @xmath73 is the adjugate ( or classical adjoint ) of @xmath2 . to prove theorem [ thm : main ]",
    ", one might first try to bound @xmath74 from above and @xmath75 from below , preferably separately .",
    "we first focus on estimating the latter , which is already nontrivial .",
    "it is classical that the determinant of a positive semidefinite matrix @xmath76 is bounded above by the product of its diagonal entries : @xmath77 this well - known result is sometimes called hadamard s inequality  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  7.8.1 ) . a lower bound of this form , however , is not possible without additional assumptions .",
    "surprisingly , there is such an inequality when @xmath2 is diagonally dominant with positive entries ; and , when @xmath2 is also balanced , an improved upper bound .",
    "[ thm : detbound ] let @xmath29 , and let @xmath2 be an @xmath25 symmetric matrix with off - diagonal entries @xmath78 .    1 .",
    "if @xmath2 is diagonally dominant , then @xmath79 2 .",
    "if @xmath2 is diagonally balanced , then @xmath80        the bounds above depend on the largest off - diagonal entry of @xmath2 ( in an essential way for ( * a * ) ; see example [ nonupperbndex ] ) , and thus are ill - adapted to prove theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "for instance , combining theorem [ thm : detbound ] ( * a * ) with hadamard s inequality applied to the positive definite @xmath73 in the obvious way gives estimates which are worse than ( [ eq : spectralinftybound ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , theorem  [ thm : detbound ] should be of independent interest , and we prove it in section  [ sec : hadamard ] .    as an immediate application of theorems [ thm : main ] and [ thm : detbound ] , we obtain a bound on @xmath73 for balanced , positive @xmath2 .    [ adjugatecor ] let @xmath29 , and let @xmath2 be a symmetric @xmath25 matrix @xmath2 with off - diagonal entries @xmath81 . if @xmath2 is diagonally balanced , then the adjugate @xmath73 satisfies the bound : @xmath82    we finish this introduction with a brief overview of how our main results are proved .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] will be generalized in theorem  [ thm : generalmain ] where we consider diagonally dominant matrices @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "we break up the proof of this general theorem into three main steps in sections  [ sec : cornercase ] to [ sec : mainproof ] , where we write @xmath85 as @xmath86 for simplicity .",
    "the first step considers the problem of maximizing @xmath13 over symmetric diagonally dominant @xmath2 with @xmath53 and @xmath14 in some finite intervals ( section  [ sec : cornercase ] ) . in this case , the maximum is achieved when @xmath2 is on the _ corners _ of the space ; namely , when @xmath53 and @xmath14 are one of the endpoints of the finite intervals . in the second step ( section  [ sec : infinity ] ) , we analyze the behavior of corner matrices at infinity and show that the limit @xmath87 as @xmath36 when @xmath59 is a signless laplacian ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) is at most @xmath88 . combined with the first step , this verifies that the matrix @xmath86 maximizes @xmath13 over the space of symmetric diagonally dominant matrices @xmath89 .",
    "the remainder of the argument deals with the behavior of @xmath13 near @xmath86 to show that @xmath86 is indeed the unique maximizer ( section  [ sec : smallt ] ) .",
    "all three steps are combined in section [ sec : mainproof ] .",
    "the inequalities of theorem [ thm : detbound ] are proved using a block matrix factorization in section  [ sec : hadamard ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with a brief discussion of open questions in section  [ sec : problems ] .",
    "the ( @xmath0-norm ) condition number @xmath90 of a matrix @xmath76 plays an important role in numerical linear algebra . for instance , the relative error @xmath91 of an approximate solution @xmath92 to a set of linear equations @xmath93 is bounded by the product of @xmath94 and the relative size of the residual , @xmath95 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . directly from theorem [ thm : main ] , we may bound the condition number of a positive , diagonally dominant symmetric matrix .",
    "thus , numerical linear computation involving such matrices is well - behaved .",

    "we next discuss another application of theorem [ thm : main ] to the numerical stability of inverses of a large family of functions .",

    "we remark that solutions @xmath139 to equations ( [ mom_match_eqn ] ) also exhibit a rich combinatorial structure which has been explored ( within a more general framework ) by sanyal , sturmfels , and vinzant using matroid theory and algebraic geometry @xcite .",
