    "understanding of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is one of the main topics in the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the qgp created in these reactions is by no means a static matter and exists as a transient state whose lifetime is of the order of @xmath2 1 - 10 fm/@xmath3 .",
    "it is non - trivial even whether local equilibrium is really reached or not , which should be also clarified through the observation .",
    "hence , one first has to justify the local equilibration by comparing the model calculation with experimental data .",
    "this is the starting point of further studies on the qgp under equilibrium . in order to understand thermodynamical ( bulk ) and transport properties of the qgp in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "one then has to develop a _",
    "dynamical _ analysis tool which links the observables with the equation of state ( eos ) and transport coefficients of the qgp .",
    "it is inevitable to apply each relevant model to each stage of the collisions and unify these models consistently to describe the whole stage of the reactions .    along the line of thought",
    ", we have constructed a dynamical and unified model based on a fully three - dimensional hydrodynamic description of the qgp @xcite .",
    "one of the major discoveries at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is that elliptic flow parameters , which are intimately related with the degree of thermalisation , are well described within a framework of relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "an assumption of local thermalisation has to be made in hydrodynamics .",
    "however , local thermalisation can be expected only in the intermediate stage .",
    "thus , one needs to model dynamics of reactions appropriately before and after the hydrodynamic stage to draw informations of the qgp from experimental data .",
    "once we obtain the hydrodynamic evolution of the qgp , information of local thermodynamic variables is available to analyse other observables such as @xmath1 suppression , heavy quark diffusion and thermal radiation . in this way ,",
    "hydrodynamic models enable one to analyse a vast body of data in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "hydrodynamics is a general framework to describe the space - time evolution of locally thermalised matter for a given eos .",
    "this framework has been applied to the intermediate stage in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we neglect the effects of dissipation and concentrate on discussion about ideal hydrodynamic models .",
    "the main ingredient in ideal hydrodynamic models is the eos of hot and dense matter governed by qcd .",
    "in addition , one also needs to assign initial conditions to the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "hydrodynamics can be applied to a system as long as its local thermalisation is maintained .",
    "however , in the final stage the particles are freely streaming toward the detectors and their mean free path is almost infinite .",
    "this is obviously beyond the applicability of hydrodynamics .",
    "hence we also need a description to decouple the particles from the rest of the system .",
    "the hydrodynamic modeling of relativistic heavy ion collisions needs an eos , initial conditions and a decoupling prescription .",
    "hydrodynamic modeling has been sophisticated for these years and tested against rhic data @xcite .",
    "the eos is in principle calculated from lattice qcd simulations . instead of using the result from lattice qcd simulations ,",
    "we employ a phenomenological model in this study . at high energy density",
    ", the eos can be described by a bag model @xmath4 here @xmath5 is pressure and @xmath6 is energy density .",
    "the bag constant @xmath7 is tuned to match pressure of the qgp phase to that of a hadron resonance gas at critical temperature @xmath8 : @xmath9 . a hadron gas in heavy ion collisions is not in chemical equilibrium below the chemical freezeout temperature @xmath10 which is close to @xmath8 @xcite , so the hadron phase may not be chemically equilibrated .",
    "a chemically frozen ( or only partially equilibrated ) hadron resonance gas can be described by introducing the chemical potential for each hadron @xcite .    for a decoupling prescription ,",
    "the cooper - frye formula @xcite is almost a unique choice to convert the hydrodynamic picture to the particle picture .",
    "contribution from resonance decays should be taken into account by applying decay kinematics to the outcome of the cooper - frye formula .",
    "the decoupling temperature @xmath11 is fixed through _ simultaneous _ fitting of @xmath12 spectra for various hadrons in the low @xmath12 region .",
    "the prescription to calculate the momentum distribution as above is sometimes called the sudden freezeout model since the mean free path of the particles changes from zero ( ideal fluid ) to infinity ( free streaming ) within a thin layer .",
    "although this model is too simple , it has been used in hydrodynamic calculations for a long time .",
    "recently one utilises hadronic cascade models to describe the gradual freezeout @xcite in a more realistic way . as will be shown",
    ", the hadronic afterburner is mandatory in understanding elliptic flow data .",
    "phase space distributions for hadrons are initialized below @xmath8 by using the cooper - frye formula .",
    "we employ a hadronic cascade model jam @xcite to describe the space - time evolution of the interacting hadron gas .",
    "this kind of hybrid approaches in which the qgp fluids are followed by hadronic cascade models automatically describes both the chemical and thermal freezeout and is much more realistic especially for the late stage than the naive cooper - frye prescription .",
    "initial conditions in hydrodynamic simulations are so chosen as to reproduce the centrality and rapidity dependences of multiplicity @xmath13 .",
    "initial conditions here are energy density distribution @xmath14 and flow velocity @xmath15 at the initial time @xmath16 . again baryon density is neglected since the net baryon density is quite small at midrapidity at rhic . at mid-(space - time)rapidity @xmath17 , one can parametrise the initial entropy density based on the glauber model @xmath18 the soft / hard fraction @xmath19 is adjusted to reproduce the measured centrality dependence @xcite of the charged hadron multiplicity at midrapidity . by using the eos , one can calculate the initial energy density distribution together with pressure and temperature distributions from eq .",
    "( [ eq : entroini ] ) . for space - time rapidity dependence of initial conditions and",
    "a novel initial condition based on the colour glass condensate ( cgc ) picture , see refs .",
    "the fitting of multiplicity is the starting point of further analysis based on hydrodynamic simulations .    in the hydrodynamic models , various combinations of initial conditions , eos and decoupling prescriptions are available to analyse the experimental data .",
    "of course , final results largely depend on modeling of each stage .",
    "so it is quite important to constrain each model and its inherent parameters through systematic analysis of the data toward a comprehensive understanding of the qgp .",
    "anisotropic transverse flow can be quantified by fourier components of azimuthal distribution , @xmath20 , where the average is taken over by weighting azimuthal distribution .",
    "the second harmonics @xmath21 is called elliptic flow parameter and is intimately related with the eos and the degree of thermalisation @xcite .      the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath21 observed by phobos @xcite has a triangular shape : @xmath21 is maximum at midrapidity and decreases as moving away from midrapidity . on the other hand , in the ideal hydrodynamic calculations with @xmath22 mev",
    ", @xmath21 depends mildly on pseudorapidity in @xmath23 .",

    "it is clear that for peripheral collisions where the multiplicity is small the hadronic viscosity plays an important role in description of the @xmath21 data .",
    "one may notice that the result from the hybrid model systematically and slightly smaller than the data .",
    "however , there could exist an effect of initial eccentricity fluctuations which is absent in the present hydrodynamic calculations and could enhance @xmath21 by @xmath25 in 0 - 5% and by @xmath26 in 50 - 60% centralities @xcite .",
    "the deviation between the results and the data may be interpreted quantitatively by this eccentricity fluctuation effect .",

    "[ fig : v2pt ] ( right ) .",
    "as demonstrated in this figure , at low @xmath29 the pion curve moves up while the proton curve moves down through rescatterings .",
    "so the hadronic rescatterings are attributed to the observed splitting patterns of @xmath30 .",
    "it should be noted that the same hadronic rescattering effect is also seen in the recent study based on the different hadronic cascade model @xcite . one can conclude that the large magnitude of the integrated @xmath21 and the strong mass ordering of the differential @xmath31 observed at rhic result from a subtle interplay between perfect fluid dynamics of the early qgp stage and dissipative dynamics of the late hadronic stage .",
    "the large magnitude of @xmath21 is due to the large overall momentum anisotropy , generated predominantly in the early qgp stage . whereas the strong mass splitting behavior at low @xmath29 reflects the redistribution of this momentum anisotropy among the different hadron species during the hadronic rescattering phase .",
    "hadronic rescattering turns out to cause the mass ordering of @xmath28 .",
    "then , what happens to the ( hidden ) strangeness sector in which rescattering with other hadrons does not happen so frequently @xcite ?",
    "figure [ fig : v2pt_phi ] ( left ) shows @xmath28 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath28 curves for pions and protons separate as discussed before , whereas @xmath28 for the @xmath0 meson remains almost unchanged during the hadronic stage . as a result of rescattering the proton elliptic flow ends up being smaller than that of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath34 for @xmath35gev/@xmath3 , even though @xmath36 .",
    "hadronic dissipative effects are seen to be particle specific , depending on their scattering cross sections which couple them to the medium .",
