    "multiple stellar populations are routinely found in old galactic and intermediate - age magellanic clouds star clusters ( piotto 2008 and references therein ) . whether they are a signature of the cluster formation process or a result of the star formation history and related stellar evolution effects , is still matter of lively discussion ( renzini 2008 , bekki et al .",
    "2008 , decressin et al .",
    "the prototype of globular hosting multiple populations has for long time been @xmath0   cen ( villanova et al .",
    "2007 ) , although the current understanding is that it is possibly the remnant of a dwarf galaxy ( carraro & lia 2000 , tsuchiya et al .",
    "2004 , romano et al .",
    "+ most chemical studies of the stellar population in @xmath0   cen are restricted within 20 arcmin of the cluster radius center ( see norris & da costa 1995 , villanova et al . 2007 ) , where , probably , the diverse stellar components are better mixed and less subjected to external perturbations , like the galactic tidal stress , than the outer regions . assessing whether there are population inhomogeneities in @xmath0 cen or gradients in metal abundance is a crucial step to progress in our understanding of this fascinating stellar system .",
    "+ in scarpa et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2007 ) we presented the results of a spectroscopic campaign to study the stellar radial velocity dispersion profile at @xmath1 25 arcmin , half way to the tidal radius ( @xmath1 57 arcmin , harris 1996 ) , in an attempt to find a new way to verify the mond ( modified newtonian dynamics , milgrom 1983 ) theory of gravitation .",
    "+ in this paper we make use of a subsample of those spectra ( the ones taken for rgb stars ) and extract estimates of metal abundances for some of the most interesting elements . the aim is to study the chemical trends of the stellar populations in the cluster periphery , to try to learn whether the cluster outskirts contain , both qualitatively and quantitatively , the same population mix and to infer from this additional information on the cluster formation and evolution .",
    "+ the layout of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we describe observations and data reduction , while sect .  3",
    "is dedicated to the derivation of metal abundances .",
    "these latter are then discussed in detail in sect .",
    "5 is devoted to the comparison of the metal abundance trends in the inner and outer regions of @xmath0   cen , and , finally , sect .",

    ". a straight line has been fitted to mpp stars .",
    "the value of the slope ( _ a _ ) is given .",
    "in both cases _ a _ is out of more than 3@xmath3 with respect the null trend value , implying that trends for mpp are real . ]",
    "looking at fig .  6 , we immediately recognize two important facts .",
    "+ first , all the studies we culled from the literature for omega cen central regions show the same trends .",
    "+ second , and more important for the purpose of this paper , we do not see any significant difference bewteen the outer ( filled circles ) and inner ( all the other symbols ) regions of the cluster .",
    "only ti seems to be slightly over - abundant in the outer regions with respect to the more central ones .                as for the more scattered elements ( see fig .",
    "7 ) we notice that na shows the opposite trend in the outer regions with respect to the inner ones , but this is possibly related to a bias induced by the signal to noise of our data which does not allow us to detect na - poor stars in the metal poor population . on the other hand",
    ", y and ba do not show any spatial difference .",
    "+ interestingly enough , at low metallicity ba shows quite a significant scattered distribution , expecially for stars more metal - poor than -1.2 dex , covering a range of 1.5 dex .",
    "this behaviour is shared with y and na , althought at a lower level .",
    "furthermore , looking carefully at fig .",
    "4 , it is possible to see a hint of bimodality for the ba content of the stars having [ fe / h]@xmath4 - 1.5 dex ( i.e. belonging to the mmp ) , with the presence of a group of objects having [ ba / fe]@xmath11.0 dex , and another having [ ba / fe]@xmath1 - 0.2 dex .",
    "the same trend is visible in all the literature data . + we remind the reader that such a bimodal distribution is similar to that found by johnson et al .",
    "( 2009 , thier fig .",
    "8) for al .",
    "+ finally , we compare our y vs. ba trend with literature in fig .",
    "also in this case the agreement is very good and no radial trend is found .",
    "+ the stars studied by wylie - de boer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) deserve special attention .",
    "they belong to the kapteyn group , but their kinematics and chemistry suggest a likely association with @xmath0 cen . these stars , in spite of being part of a moving group , exhibit quite a large iron abundance spread ( see fig . 6 and 7 ) ,",
    "totally compatible with the one of @xmath0 cen .",
    "also their na and ba abundance ( see fig .",
    "7 ) are comparable with those of the cluster .",
    "we suggest that the comparison with our data reinforces the idea that the kapteyn group is likely formed by stars stripped away from @xmath0 cen .",
    "in this study , we analized a sample of 48 rgb stars located half - way to the tidal radius of @xmath0 cen , well beyond any previous study devoted to the detailed chemical composition of the different cluster sub - populations .",
    "+ we compared the abundance trends in the cluster outer regions with literature studies which focus on the inner regions of @xmath0 cen .",
    "+ the results of this study can be summarized as follows :    @xmath5 we could not highlight any difference between the outer and inner regions as far as [ fe / h]is concerned : the same mix of different iron abundance population is present in both locations ;    @xmath5 most elements appear in the same proportion both in the inner and in the outer zone , irrespective of the particular investigation one takes into account for the comparison ;    @xmath5 [ ba / fe ] shows an indication of a bimodal distribution at low metallicity at any location in the cluster , which deserves further investigation ;    @xmath5 no indications emerge of gradients in the radial abundance trend of the elements we could measure .",
    "our results clearly depend on a small data - set , and more extended studies are encouraged to confirm or deny our findings .",
