    "spectral moments are integrals of powers of frequency multiplied by the corresponding spectral function and integrated over all frequency .",
    "they can reveal important information about the structure and spread of the spectral function and , in some cases , can also reveal interesting information about different many - body correlation functions . in theory , knowledge of all spectral moments",
    "allows one to reconstruct the function , but that procedure is well - known to be unstable and is not commonly used in numerical calculations .",
    "the spectral moments also correspond to derivatives of the green functions with respect to relative time ( either real time or imaginary time ) , evaluated at the point where the relative time is zero . as such ,",
    "the spectral moments provide information about the relative - time dependence , when expanded as a taylor series in time .",
    "spectral moment sum rules for the many - body problem were investigated in 1967 by harris and lange  @xcite shortly after the hubbard model@xcite was introduced . in that work , one can find the moment sum rules for the first three moments of the retarded green function of the hubbard model and various approximations like the alloy analogy problem ( which is equivalent to an inhomogeneous falicov - kimball model@xcite ) .",
    "they also developed a strong - coupling projection method to find spectral moments within each of the different hubbard bands .",
    "this approach is an approximate one , as the projection operator is developed in a power series of the hopping divided by the interaction strength . shortly thereafter ,",
    "nolting@xcite applied the spectral moment sum rules to develop approximations for the momentum - dependent green function that have two poles , with the weights and locations of the poles fixed by the corresponding sum rules .",
    "this approach has been developed quite extensively , and applied to a variety of different problems including dynamical mean - field theory@xcite . that work examined ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic long - range order in the hubbard model , different approximation schemes for perturbation theory that produce the correct strong - coupling limit , and extended the sum rules to the retarded self - energy .",
    "the approach has also been applied to photoemission and inverse photoemission@xcite , where it was recognized that the moments of the so - called lesser and greater green functions play an important role .",
    "finally , harris and lange s projection technique was applied to the lesser and greater green functions to examine spectral properties of the hubbard model@xcite .",
    "most of that work has had as its focus using the sum rules to develop different approximations , or to learn semiquantitative features of the many - body problem .",
    "but there is another application of spectral moment sum rules that is quite important for computational work .",
    "the sum rules allow , in certain circumstances , for numerically exact computations to be benchmarked against the sum rules .",
    "steven white applied this to the hubbard model in two dimensions@xcite , and deisz , hess , and serene applied it to the fluctuation - exchange approximation@xcite at the matsubara frequencies .",
    "the sum rules have been generalized to nonequilibrium situations for the green functions@xcite and self - energies@xcite . in the case",
    "when one applies a spatially uniform , but time - dependent , electric field to the system , it turns out that many of the low - order moments are time - independent , even though the hamiltonian has explicit time - dependence due to the field being turned on at a specific time ( or because the field has nontrivial time dependence ) .",
    "nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory@xcite can solve the many - body problem exactly , and the sum rules are employed to benchmark the quality of the solutions@xcite .",
    "finally , spectral moment sum rules , when viewed as a taylor series expansion in time , are now being employed to improve both the speed and the quality of hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo approaches@xcite for solving the impurity problem in dynamical mean - field theory@xcite . in particular ,",
    "recent work@xcite has shown that employing the exact taylor series expansions for short imaginary times allows one to use much larger trotter error , yet achieve high accuracy with the hirsch - fye algorithm , so that it is competitive with continuous - time - based approaches@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we want to extend the spectral - moment sum rules for the retarded green function and retarded self - energy to inhomogeneous cases , which are becoming more important , and where one can find similar improvement in the efficiency of impurity solvers for use in inhomogeneous dynamical mean - field theory problems .",
    "there are four main thrusts of work in the inhomogeneous many - body problem currently : ( i ) examining the properties of strongly correlated multilayers because of their potential for quantum - mechanical engineering of device properties@xcite ; ( ii ) examining the properties of ultracold atoms on optical lattices but spatially confined by a magnetic or optical trap@xcite ; ( iii ) examining the properties of a strongly correlated material that is disordered ; and ( iv ) examining properties of strongly correlated materials with inhomogeneous spatial ordering ( like a charge or spin density wave ) . in the multilayer problem ,",
    "most solutions have relied on approximate techniques for the hubbard model , or have examined simplified models like the falicov - kimball model ( recently , however , the numerical renormalization group has been applied to multilayer hubbard systems@xcite ) . in the cold atom problem , little work has been applied to green function - based techniques ( although this is increasing ) ; here the spectral - moment sum rules could aid both in benchmarking and in improving the accuracy and efficiency of numerical algorithms .",
    "the strongly correlated material with disorder problem has had many different techniques applied to it , but most of them are approximate in one way or another , so understanding the quality of the approximations is important .",
    "less work has taken place in ordered phase calculations , especially for sum rules when the system is spatially ordered ; these results can be immediately examined with the results presented here . in all cases ,",
    "use of sum rules can help provide quantitative data to analyze how accurate the numerical solutions are .",
    "finally , inhomogeneous systems are likely to be studied within the nonequilibrium context . here",
    ", we also generalize the nonequilibrium sum rules to the inhomogeneous environment and we consider a wide range of different nonequilibrium contexts .    the remainder of this contribution is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the formalism for deriving the spectral moments in equilibrium ; in section iii , we generalize to nonequilibrium cases ; in section iv , we discuss different applications of sum rules within dynamical mean - field theory ; and in section v , we present the conclusions and summary .",
    "the equilibrium hamiltonian for the inhomogeneous falicov - kimball@xcite and hubbard@xcite models can be written in the following unified form : @xmath0 here @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for a conduction electron at site @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding operators for a localized electron at site @xmath3 ; in the case of the hubbard model , the @xmath6-electrons are the spin - up electrons and the @xmath7-electrons are the spin - down electrons .",
    "the hopping matrix is denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the @xmath6- and @xmath7-electrons , respectively ; for the falicov - kimball model we have @xmath10 , while for the hubbard model we have @xmath11 ( one can also consider an asymmetric hubbard model with @xmath12 ) .",
    "note that the hopping matrix need not be translationally invariant , the only requirement is that it is hermitian .",
    "the local chemical potentials are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the conduction and localized electrons with @xmath15 and @xmath16 the corresponding local potentials ( @xmath17 for the hubbard model in a vanishing magnetic field ; @xmath18 for the falicov - kimball model , since it does not enter into the conduction electron moments ) , and the local interaction between different particles is @xmath19 . in the case of disorder ,",
    "one often averages the hamiltonian , and different measurable operator expectation values , over the given disorder distribution for the different parameters that are disordered .",
    "we will not discuss the details of how to treat those kinds of problems here .",
    "the sum rules we derive would be for one quenched disorder configuration ( corresponding to a particular choice of parameters in the hamiltonian ) , and could subsequently be averaged with respect to the given disorder distribution , if desired .",
    "note that this hamiltonian is time independent , and we have no net current flow , so it corresponds to an equilibrium problem ( in other words , it is in the `` slow limit '' if the potentials correspond to an electric field , where the charge rearranges itself into a static redistribution in response to the potential rather than allowing current to flow ) .",
    "we will also examine a wide class of nonequilibrium cases below .",
    "we do not make any assumptions about the translational invariance of any of the parameters that enter the hamiltonian , so the green function will generically depend on two spatial coordinates rather than on their difference .",
    "but in equilibrium , the system does have time - translation invariance , so we can describe the green functions with a single frequency by making a temporal fourier transform .",
    "the retarded green function is defined to be @xmath20 in the time representation , with @xmath21 the partition function , @xmath22 the inverse temperature , and @xmath23 the anticommutator .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators are in the ( equilibrium ) heisenberg representation , where @xmath24 for any operator @xmath25 ; in this representation , the time - translation invariance is easy to show due to the invariance properties of the trace and the fact that the hamiltonian commutes with itself .",

    "note , that in cases where we have inhomogeneity arising from the spatial long - range order ( say charge or spin density wave order , for example ) , then the hamiltonian is actually translationally invariant , but the sum rules have inhomogeneous results due to the explicit evaluation of the different expectation values ( the charge density will vary from site to site in a charge density wave , for example ) .",

    "this procedure requires one to perform calculations over a range of different disorder distributions and then perform the averaging . if the system tends to self - average , not too many specific configurations would be needed , but if there is interesting physics arising from rare regions of the distributions , many calculations would be needed , and these calculations can get to be rather lengthy .",
    "one rather general form for the nonequilibrium hubbard - falicov - kimball hamiltonian is @xmath56 in this case , we have added time dependence to all of the parameters in the hamiltonian , but have not introduced any additional forms of interaction within the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , this generalization allows for a rather rich class of nonequilibrium problems to be studied .",
    "for example , if we are examining a multilayered device with electronic charge reconstruction  @xcite ( where the potentials @xmath15 and @xmath57 are determined by an additional semiclassical poisson equation ) , and we use a vector potential to describe an external electric field that drives current through the system  @xcite , then we would have a time dependent hopping determined by the peierls substitution  @xcite .",
    "if we want to examine an interaction quench , as is often studied in cold atom systems , we would have a ( typically harmonic ) trapping potential @xmath15 and @xmath57 and the interaction @xmath19 would become time dependent switching from one value for early times to another value for later times  @xcite such as would occur near a feshbach resonance if the bias magnetic field is changed from one value to another ( for some experiments , the potentials or hopping could also change when the coupling changes ) ; the switching could be sudden as in a rapid quench , or adiabatic , with a slowly varying change , or anything in between .",
    "in addition , within the cold - atom picture , we could imagine creating time - dependent trap potentials @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this would allow us to examine what would happen if we applied an impulse to the atomic cloud , or if we shifted the origin of the harmonic potential from one spatial location to another , and then examined how the center - of - mass oscillates and damps back to the thermal state , or to some nonthermal steady state .",
    "finally , we could examine the so - called bragg spectroscopy experiment , where the optical lattice potential amplitude is oscillated with some set frequency and one observes things like the change in the momentum distribution after the system is driven for a certain period of time , or the change in the double occupancy . in this case",
    ", the hopping , the local potentials , and the interaction could all become time dependent , but can still be described by the general form of our hamiltonian .",
    "there are a few subtle points to keep in mind with these nonequilibrium problems .",
    "for example , in the case of a multilayered system with electronic charge reconstruction , the charge reconstruction is created in the distant past , so it corresponds to an equilibrium static potential which does not contribute to any flow of current .",
    "the field that drives the current is described by a time - dependent vector potential , which is turned on at a particular time .",
    "one can examine the transient current flow or the steady - state current flow by examining how the system responds to the external field .",
    "there are two immediate applications of spectral moment sum rules within dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "the first is to use them to evaluate the high - frequency asymptotic behavior exactly and then supplement the high frequency results by numerical calculations at low frequencies , and the second , closely related , is to use them to evaluate the short imaginary time behavior exactly and supplement with long - time numerical calculations .",
    "the latter has been already discussed within the context of the hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo algorithm for solving the impurity problem in dynamical mean - field theory and the results there show great promise as a means to improve the accuracy and the efficiency of calculations@xcite . the basic idea ( at half - filling )",
    "is that the curvature , which grows sharply with increasing @xmath71 , immediately determines the short - time behavior for the green function .",
    "because of the sharp dependence on @xmath72 , one would need to use a very small discretization step for the qmc to accurately describe such behavior , which would then be very costly in terms of computational time .",
    "instead , one uses a coarser grid , but before performing the fourier transform to matsubara frequencies , one simply creates a finer grid and uses the short time relations to find the behavior close to @xmath73 , and uses simple interpolation for other time values ( a shape preserving spline would work well in this context ) . then the fourier transformation will much more accurately reflect the true behavior of the system , and all of the high - frequency structure will be properly recovered , so that the qmc can be used to determine the low - frequency data where it is most accurate .",
    "( it has already been demonstrated that this approach is competitive with other qmc techniques such as the continuous - time algorithm . )",
    "issues of accuracy and efficiency will become increasingly important for inhomogeneous dynamical mean - field theory problems ( like multilayers or ultracold atoms in a trap ) because one needs to solve an impurity problem at each inequivalent lattice site of the inhomogeneous system .",
    "this can range from tens to hundreds of impurity solvers for multilayered systems to many thousands or more for ultracold atomic systems in a trap .",
    "we wo nt discuss the application within quantum monte carlo approaches further here , and instead will concentrate on examining a different application , which is to solve the dynamical mean - field theory for the falicov - kimball model with fixed local chemical potentials on the lattice sites .",
    "this approach works equally well ( with appropriate modifications ) for the two - site approximation to the hubbard model@xcite in the insulating phase .    the dynamical mean - field theory for the falicov - kimball model is well established in the literature@xcite , so we just present the relevant formulas .",
    "starting from a local self - energy @xmath74 , one must solve the dyson equation for the local green function [ @xmath75 @xmath76\\delta_{ik}+t_{ik}\\right \\}g_{kj}(i\\omega_n)=\\delta_{ij}. \\label{eq : dmft_dyson}\\ ] ] here @xmath77 is the fermionic matsubara frequency . when the system is homogeneous , a fourier transformation allows this problem to be solved immediately .",
    "when one has inhomogeneity in one dimension , as in multilayered structures , the local green function ( of an infinite device ) can be found from the so - called quantum zipper algorithm@xcite which expresses the green function in terms of continued fractions . for finite cold atom systems , one can use lapack ( or sparse matrix ) routines to perform numerical matrix inversions to find the local green function@xcite .",

    "the most critical one is that the equilibrium dos , when there is no field present , has a divergence in it that goes like an inverse square root of frequency .",
    "such a singularity requires an infinite time domain to properly find the fourier transform ( because the function has an amplitude that decays like a power law in time ) , but our numerical calculations are always truncated to a finite range , so the fourier transform has the singularity smoothed over and the truncation can lead to unphysical oscillations in the dos as a function of frequency ( due to the presence of a sharp cutoff in time ) .",
    "furthermore , we calculate on a discrete grid in time , which can have further effects on the fourier transform , especially for high enough frequencies . finally , the results , particularly at large times , are sensitive to the number of energy points in the integration grid over the two energies .",
    "all of these challenges make it much more useful to directly calculate the results for the moments by evaluating the derivatives of the green functions as functions of time .",
    "this can actually be done analytically for the form of the green function ( because of the time - ordered products ) , and it produces exactly the requisite moments .",
    "in addition , we can do it numerically in the time domain , and we verify that the sum rules are satisfied to an accuracy much smaller than the step size in time ( when evaluated in the time domain via numerical differentiation ) .    even though the numerical calculation of the dos in the cdw phase is challenging , as explained above , we present results for this calculation in figs .",
    "[ fig : dos_cdw_u=1.5 ] and [ fig : dos_cdw_u=3 ] for the @xmath152 sublattice dos .",
    "the parameters chosen are an electric field equal to 1 , and turned on at time @xmath135 , and interaction strength @xmath133 and @xmath148 ( we have a time domain cutoff running from @xmath154 to @xmath155 with a time step of @xmath156 ) .",
    "we compare a number of different average time results including ( a ) the equilibrium result @xmath157 , ( b ) @xmath158 , ( c ) @xmath159 , and ( d ) @xmath160 .",
    "we do not use the `` equilibrium '' results from the real time calculation because our finite time - domain cutoff leads to spurious oscillations .",
    "in addition , the dos is already modified at @xmath158 because the relative time fourier transform involves a large number of points in time where the field is on , and because the green function has structure with such long - ranged tails in time , one can see an effect even before the average time where the field has been turned on .",
    "when the field is turned on , the dos naturally changes shape ( and the square - root singularity appears to be smoothed into a finite peak ) , but the changes are much smaller than in the normal phase .",
    "surprisingly , we predominantly see structure at either odd bloch frequencies or even bloch frequencies , but not both , and the structure does not look like a broadened , and split delta function as in the normal phase , but instead looks more like some kind of ordered phase gap structure , but the features can be quite small in some cases . it is clear we have not yet fully reached the steady state , but it also appears clear what the steady state dos will eventually look like . finally , we comment that if we take the dos as functions of frequency ( our frequency range is chosen to run from @xmath161 ) , multiply by the appropriate power of frequency and integrate to check the sum rules , then all sum rules except the second moment are satisfied to better than 1% .",
    "the second moment is worse , because we get significant contributions from the noisy tails of the dos which do nt cancel as they do for the odd moments .",
    "if we put the frequency cutoff closer to @xmath162 , then the second moment accuracy increases dramatically .",
    "but we know that this is the least accurate way to check the moment sum rules .",
    "in this work , we have shown how to determine exact spectral moment sum rules for the retarded green functions and self - energies of inhomogeneous strongly correlated systems .",
    "while our analysis is quite general , for concreteness , we provided explicit results for a combined hubbard - falicov - kimball model .",
    "we envision these results can be applied to strongly correlated multilayers , ultracold atomic systems in traps , or strongly correlated materials with disorder ( although we did not discuss the last case in much detail ) .",
    "the sum rules can be used to gain qualitative information about the many - body solutions , benchmark numerical calculations , be used to evaluate the tails of infinite sums ( or infinite products ) allowing for smaller energy cutoffs , or be used to improve the accuracy of hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo approaches by determining the short - imaginary - time behavior exactly .",
    "we provided a full derivation of the sum rules in equilibrium , and then discussed a number of different nonequilibrium situations appropriate for multilayers , for cold atom systems , and for ordered phase systems ( such as a cdw ) . in the case of multilayers ,",
    "the change in the local electrical potential energy , induced by an electronic charge reconstruction , modifies the sum rules , but the additional scalar potential , that creates an electric field to drive current through the device , does not .",
    "this motivates one to decouple the description , using a scalar potential and poisson s equation in a semiclassical analysis to determine the modified hamiltonian due to the electronic charge reconstruction , but use a time - dependent vector potential to describe the electric field that drives current through the system . in the case of cold atoms , we discussed nonequilibrium situations corresponding to pulling the lattice in the presence of a static trap , rapidly changing the location of the trap and examining the transient response , and changing the interaction strength ( say due to a feshbach resonance , by changing the magnetic field ) and examining the response to an interaction quench .",
    "for the ordered phase , we examined the cdw state of the falicov - kimball model at zero temperature , with an uniform electric field turned on at a specific time .",
    "we feel these sum rules will have a broad application across a number of different systems and calculations .",
    "it is obvious that a similar exercise can be carried out for bosonic systems .",
    "these will have most relevance for cold atom problems , where bosonic atoms are readily available within the alkali family .",
    "the sum rules for bosons become more complicated , especially at higher orders , because we used identities such as @xmath163 which hold only for fermionic systems .",
    "we are currently working on the generalization of these sum rules to bosonic problems which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "of particular interest is a falicov - kimball model with light fermions and heavy bosons , which is realized in k - rb mixtures used to make dipolar molecules if the system is placed on a deep enough optical lattice .",
