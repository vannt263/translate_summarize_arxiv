    "the galactic center is a complex environment , harboring what is believed to be a supermassive black hole , sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) , surrounded by a blend of new and old stellar populations , thermal and nonthermal gas components , and a wide array of both compact and diffuse high - energy sources ( see @xcite or @xcite for recent reviews ) . in an exciting recent development , the galactic center has been identified as a source of tev @xmath0-rays  by the air erenkov  telescopes hess @xcite , whipple @xcite , cangaroo @xcite and magic @xcite . while many of the original observations initially measured different spectra and luminosities for the galactic center source @xcite , subsequent reprocessing and analysis has brought all the detections into agreement @xcite . here , we concentrate exclusively on the hess data as they provide the best constraints on the source properties .",
    "the signal from the galactic center was detected by hess in observations conducted over two epochs ( june - august 2003 and march - september 2004 ; @xcite ) with a combined @xmath9 excess above the background @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this source is a power law with photon index @xmath10 , and the total flux above 1  tev is @xmath11  m@xmath12  s@xmath13 @xcite . as argued by @xcite , this hess source does not appear to be coincident with the egret galactic center source 3eg  j1746 - 2851 .",
    "there are two reasons for this : first , the egret source excludes the galactic center at the @xmath14 confidence level @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the hess source is coincident within @xmath15 of sgr a * , though with a centroid displaced roughly @xmath16 ( @xmath17  pc ) to the east of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "second , the egret spectrum extrapolated into the hess energy range over - predicts ( by a factor @xmath18 ) the tev @xmath0-ray flux of the galactic center source . although it is possible that both sources are associated with the snr sagittarius a east , the hess tev source is probably associated with the black hole itself , given its angular proximity to sgr a*.    if the tev @xmath0-rays  do originate from sgr a * , then this presents somewhat of a theoretical puzzle : given what we understand about sgr a *  and the interactions with its nearby environment , this object should not be directly producing a significant flux of tev photons .",
    "several possible scenarios for producing these @xmath0-rays  have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including that of @xcite .",
    "these last authors show that protons can be energized to tev energies by stochastic acceleration in a magnetically dominated funnel close to the black hole ( @xmath19  schwarzschild radii ) .",
    "the proton acceleration models of @xcite may also be active ( or even dominant ) in sgr a*. in either case , the relativistic protons will then diffuse along magnetic fields from small scales to large radii without experiencing adiabatic loss as is the case for ejections of plasma blobs .",
    "as the protons diffuse out through the surrounding medium , they may scatter with hydrogen nuclei in a shocked stellar wind region , and with the circumnuclear disk surrounding the black hole .",
    "such pp scattering events produce @xmath2 s , which subsequently decay into two photons .",
    "thus , this model suggests that protons random - walking their way into the gaseous few central parsecs surrounding sgr a *  may ultimately be the source of the hess - detected tev @xmath0-rays  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is this process that we aim to examine carefully in this _",
    "letter _ by carrying out a highly - detailed analysis of the proton transport and interaction , starting at the acceleration site near the black hole and extending out as far as several parsecs .",
    "we assume a distance to the galactic center of @xmath20  kpc @xcite .",
    "the motion of a relativistic proton moving through the ism is governed solely by the lorentz force due to the interstellar magnetic field : @xmath21 , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor for a proton with velocity @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the gyrofrequency for a particle with charge @xmath24 and mass @xmath25 under the influence of a magnetic field @xmath26 .",
    "thus , given a description for the magnetic field in the computational volume , the trajectory of the proton can be followed exactly . as there is no net electric field",
    ", the magnitude of the velocity @xmath27 remains constant .",
    "proton trajectories are calculated in a 6  pc@xmath16  pc@xmath16  pc cube consisting of @xmath28 equally spaced cells centered on the galactic center .",
    "the hydrogen density @xmath29 within this volume is taken from the results of simulations by @xcite .",
    "these authors computed the density distribution in this region caused by the interactions of stellar winds from the surrounding young stars .",
    "in addition to the stellar wind gas , the volume also contains a high - density ` torus ' with an inner radius of 1.2  pc and a thickness of 1  pc representing the observed circumnuclear disk containing molecular gas .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be generated everywhere in this region with an intensity that is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "the average density in the model stellar - wind gas ( taken to be any region where @xmath30  @xmath31 ) is @xmath32  @xmath31 , while it is @xmath33 233,222  @xmath31 within the model molecular torus .",
    "taking @xmath34  kev as the average temperature of the stellar - wind gas @xcite , 100  k for the temperature of the molecular torus ( @xcite and references therein ) , and assuming equipartition , the average field intensity @xmath35 is @xmath36  mg in the stellar - wind region and @xmath37  mg within the torus . as the proton moves through different densities in the computational domain ,",
    "@xmath35 is scaled to the appropriate value , indicated by the local gas density .",
    "while the above procedure scales the magnetic field intensity at any position in the grid , we also require a physical description of the field direction at each point .",
    "a useful prescription for describing a turbulent magnetic field was developed by @xcite to analyze the fundamental physics of ionic motion in the ism ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this quasi - analytic approach assumes that the magnetic field fluctuations are static and follow a kolmogorov spectrum ( though in principle any type of turbulence may be modeled in this way ) . at every position in the grid , the three - dimensional magnetic field is written as the sum over a given number of transverse waves of random polarization , with a wavevector oriented in a random direction .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we add together fluctuations from 200 wavelengths , ranging from 0.1@xmath38 to 10@xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the proton gyrofrequency at @xmath35 . in this fashion",
    ", we may then generate all three components of the magnetic field as functions of the position coordinates , for each proton released from the origin with initial velocity @xmath40 in a random direction .    with the above ingredients , the trajectory of each proton can be calculated exactly as it traverses the volume around sgr a*. the calculation",
    "is completed once the proton leaves the computational domain .",
    "since the observed - frame time step is proportional to @xmath41 , computational resources limited the calculations to proton energies between @xmath5 and @xmath42  tev .",
    "a total of 222,617 proton trajectories were calculated with energies uniformly distributed in this range .",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] shows a typical trajectory calculated in this fashion .",
    "as the proton random - walks its way toward the edge of the calculation domain by scattering off the turbulent magnetic field , it may collide with a low - energy proton in the ambient medium and produce pions via the reaction @xmath43 , where a variable number of pions are produced to conserve charge .",
    "the neutral pion will subsequently decay into two photons . in principle",
    ", one or more of the two protons in each scattering event may retain ( or gain ) sufficient energy to produce additional pions in subsequent interactions , but we will ignore their contribution to the overall pion production rate for this application .",
    "in addition , a charge exchange may occur ( roughly @xmath44 of the time ) , in which a neutron is produced in the exit channel . a fitting formula for the cross - section of pp - scattering is given by @xcite , and is typically @xmath45  mbarns for proton energies between 1 and 10  tev .",
    "to compute the fraction of relativistic protons that undergo pp - scattering , we first split the trajectories into @xmath46 energy bins ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "each proton path is then followed and if the particle enters a volume element with @xmath48  @xmath31 ( these regions will dominate the @xmath0-ray emissivity ) the incremental optical depth @xmath49 to pp - scattering within this grid cell is calculated . here , @xmath50 is the distance the proton traveled since the previous time step ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 is the average density encountered by the proton as it moved a distance @xmath50 . as long as the particle remains in that cell , we continue to sum @xmath53 .",
    "if the proton scatters out of the volume element and then subsequently returns , the new values of @xmath53 are added to the previous total .",
    "this procedure is followed for each proton trajectory in each of the 21 energy bins . the fraction of protons at energy @xmath54 that undergo a pp - scattering event in a volume element with @xmath48  @xmath31 is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the number of calculated trajectories at energy bin @xmath54 .",
    "a power - law spectrum of proton energies in the relativistic regime is a natural consequence of many acceleration processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the exact value of the spectral index depends on the details of how the protons escape . as we shall see below , the rate of diffusion and subsequent scattering of the protons is highly energy dependent .",
    "therefore , we treat the  injected \" spectral index as a variable to be fixed by the fitting procedure . by",
    " injected \" we mean the distribution of protons leaving sgr a * s region of influence and entering the wind - shocked region surrounding it .",
    "the proton spectrum is thus written as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , the total energy in protons in ergs between @xmath59  tev and @xmath6  tev .",
    "the spectrum of scattered protons in a grid cell is thus @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , defined above , is the fraction of protons with energy @xmath54 which collide with an ambient proton in that volume element .",
    "however , @xmath61 is only known down to @xmath62 , so @xmath63 is extrapolated to @xmath64  tev using the chosen power - law index @xmath65 and the value of @xmath61 at @xmath62 . as @xmath0-rays  at a given energy",
    "are preferentially produced by protons with @xmath66 greater energy , this extrapolation will not greatly affect the predictions between 0.1 and 1  tev .",
    "the fraction of protons that interact with the circumnuclear torus becomes very small at energies greater than 100  tev ( see   [ sect : results ] ) , so it is not necessary to extrapolate @xmath63 beyond 100  tev .",
    "now armed with the @xmath63 profile within each cell , we calculate the @xmath2 and @xmath0-ray emissivity for different values of @xmath67 and @xmath65 using the formalism described by @xcite .",
    "the emissivities are then converted into fluxes before the values are summed to produce the predicted @xmath0-ray spectrum from 0.1100  tev .",
    "we compared the model spectra to the observed 2003 and 2004 hess data between 0.3 and 30  tev ( taken from @xcite ) using @xmath68 fitting .",
    "the lowest @xmath68 was found for @xmath69  ergs and @xmath70 [ @xmath71d.o.f@xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) using the smaller ( larger ) of the observed error bars , and d.o.f .",
    "= degrees of freedom ] .",
    "this value for the spectral index is very robust with @xmath74 for @xmath75 or @xmath76 . the predicted 0.1100  tev spectrum and 110  tev image of the galactic center with these parameters are shown in fig .  [ fig : spect ] .",
    "the expected 110  tev luminosity from this spectrum is @xmath77  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "the predicted 1100  tev flux is @xmath78  m@xmath12  s@xmath13 , in good agreement with the observed value of @xmath79  m@xmath12  s@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "ergs , and the injected spectrum is @xmath80 .",
    "the open data points are the 2003 observed values from hess taken from @xcite , while the solid points are from the 2004 hess observations @xcite .",
    "( bottom ) contours of 110  tev flux predicted from the same model that produced the spectrum in the left - hand panel .",
    "the contours are at @xmath81 and @xmath82 [ s@xmath13  m@xmath12 ] .",
    "the oblateness evident in this image is due to the tilt angle of the molecular torus .",
    "sgr a *  is at the origin.,scaledwidth=50.5% ]    the fact that the best fit corresponds to @xmath70 indicates that the spectrum of injected particles must be significantly harder than the observed tev @xmath0-ray spectrum ( for which the spectral index is @xmath10 ) .",
    "this is simply because the higher energy protons diffuse outward from the galactic center faster than the low energy ones and as a result traverse , on average , a much smaller path length .",
    "these particles are then less likely to encounter the molecular torus and undergo a pp - scattering event that will produce a tev @xmath0-ray .",
    "a harder intrinsic spectrum is therefore required to compensate for this deficit and account for the observed spectral shape .",
    "the derived value of @xmath70 is much harder than the  standard \" power law with index @xmath84 that one might expect from simple first - order fermi scattering .",
    "perhaps this may be taken as an indication that sgr a * is not the source of energetic hadrons producing the @xmath0-ray glow in its vicinity .",
    "alternatively , the intrinsic @xmath85 proton spectrum may have been altered by interactions much closer to the black hole .",
    "another possibility is that the required hard proton spectrum might be an indication that stochastic acceleration continues as the particles diffuse outwards from the initial injection region .",
    "future work will investigate the origin and viability of the hard proton spectrum .",
    "we find that only about 30% of the computed trajectories encounter the circumnuclear torus ; the rest travel unimpeded to larger distances .",
    "however , this fraction is highly energy dependent : @xmath86% of the emitted protons encounter the torus at @xmath871212.4 , but this drops to 47% at @xmath88 , and finally to 5% at @xmath89 . as a result , the predicted @xmath0-ray spectrum exhibits a roll - over at energies @xmath90  tev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] ) .",
    "this is a robust prediction of models where sgr a *  is the source of the relativistic protons and can be tested with future hess observations .",
    "the energy - dependent proton interaction rate also suggests that a significant flux of tev protons escapes from the inner few pc surrounding sgr a *  to interact with more distant molecular gas .",
    "this would be consistent with the observed emission from the galactic center ridge .",
    "@xcite report that the inner 200  pc of the galaxy glows in tev @xmath0-rays , with the dominant emission correlated with the distribution of dense molecular gas .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of the galactic ridge emission is observed to be close to that of the galactic center source .",
    "the best - fitting model for the galactic center hess source predicts an energy of @xmath91  ergs in protons between 1 and 40  tev .",
    "@xcite estimate that a hadron distribution with an energy @xmath92  ergs ( from 440  tev ) is required to produce the observed galactic ridge emission .",
    "the ridge region is much larger than the volume within which the galactic center tev source is produced , so the escaping protons would build up the much larger energy content over time .",
    "the diffusion time to reach such large distances is @xmath93  years @xcite , so the particle accelerator would have to be at least that old .",
    "our simulations show that an injected proton index @xmath94 is required to produce the observed @xmath0-ray index @xmath95 , a steepening of @xmath96 .",
    "homogeneous diffusion with a kolmogorov or bohm turbulence spectrum would produce a steepening of @xmath97 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "our treatment in this paper has followed the diffusion of protons taking into account the variable 3-d gas density and magnetic field surrounding sgr a*. on the other hand , diffusion calculations assume a homogeneous medium , which produces misleading results when applied to regions as complex as that near sgr a*. as such , our finding that a steepening of 3/2 is required , instead of @xmath98 , may be traceable to our more accurate treatment of inhomogeneity .",
    "the hess observations suggest that there may be a common cause for both the galactic - center point source and the diffuse emission along the ridge .",
    "tev protons accelerated near sgr a *  can account for the observed flux and spectrum of the central source through scattering events with ambient protons within the circumnuclear ring .",
    "the proton spectrum injected into the gas surrounding sgr a *  must have a hard power - law index of @xmath99 , implying a non - standard acceleration process or interactions close to the acceleration region .",
    "our simulations have resulted in a predicted 110  tev image of the source for comparison with future high - resolution observations .",
    "we have found , in particular , that the predicted tev image mirrors closely the structure of the torus , including an oblateness due to projection effects in the plane of the sky . the total energy required in protons between 1 and 40  tev is @xmath100  ergs and a significant fraction of the protons do escape the neighborhood of sgr a *  without undergoing a pp collision ; these presumably diffuse to much larger distances where they can interact with other molecular material , possibly accounting for the observed galactic ridge emission .",
    "although future calculations are required to confirm this suggestion , and other origins for the observed hess source are possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this work supports the view that sgr a *  may be an important site for particle acceleration at the center of the galaxy .",
