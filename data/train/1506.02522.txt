    "perturbation methods applied in macroeconomics are used to expand the exact solution around a deterministic steady state in powers of state variables and a small parameter scaling the uncertainty in the economy .",
    "the solutions based on the taylor series expansion are intrinsically local , i.e. they are accurate in some neighborhood ( presumably small ) of the deterministic steady state . out of the neighborhood",
    "the solutions may behave odd , for example , can imply explosive dynamics @xcite .",
    "the other problem with the perturbation method is that we do not know a priori for non - trivial models how small the neighborhood must be to achieve a given level of accuracy .",
    "the recent crisis has renewed an interest in methods that provide global solutions to dsge models , i.e. the solutions some points of which are far away from the steady state .",
    "this may occur after a big shock hitting the economy , or if the initial conditions are far away from the steady state , the examples of this situation are the economies in transition and developing economies .",
    "this study presents an approach based on a perturbation technique to construct global solutions to dsge models .",
    "the proposed solutions are represented as a series in powers of a small parameter @xmath0 scaling the covariance matrix of the shocks .",
    "the zero order approximation corresponds to the solution to the deterministic model , because all shocks vanish as @xmath1 .",
    "global solutions to deterministic models can be obtained reasonably fast by effective numerical methods even for large size models @xcite .",
    "for this reason the next stages of the method are implemented assuming that the solution to the deterministic model under given initial conditions is known .",
    "higher - order systems depend only on quantities of lower orders , hence they can be solved recursively .",
    "the homogeneous part of these systems is the same for all orders and depends on the deterministic solution .",
    "consequently , each system can be represented as a rational expectation model with time - varying parameters . in the case of rational expectations models with constant parameters the stable block of equations",
    "can be isolated and solved forward .",
    "this is not possible for models with time - varying parameters .",
    "the other contribution of the present work is a method proposed for solving general systems of linear rational expectations models with time - varying parameters and determines the conditions under which the solutions of the method exist .",
    "the method starts with finding a finite - horizon solution by using backward recursion .",
    "next we prove that as the horizon tends to infinity the finite - horizon solutions approach to a limit solution that is bounded for all positive time .",
    "the proposed method for solving linear rational expectations models with time - varying parameters may be valuable in itself , for example , for solving models with anticipated structural and policy changes .",
    "notice that whenever the deterministic solution is global in state variables so is the approximate solution to the stochastic problem . at the same time , if the parameter @xmath0 is small enough , then the solution obtained is close to the deterministic one .",
    "for this reason , we shall call this approach semi - global .    to illustrating how the method works we apply it to the asset pricing model of @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the model allows for obtaining the approximations in an analytical form .",
    "we compare the policy functions of the second order solution of the semi - global method with the local taylor series expansion of orders two and six @xcite .",
    "the results show that the semi - global solution is more accurate , in some sense , than even the sixth order of the local taylor expansion .",
    "this paper contributes to a growing literature on using the perturbation technique for solving dsge models .",
    "the perturbation methodology in economics has been advanced by judd and co - authors as in @xcite .",
    "@xcite give a theoretical basis for using perturbation methods in dsge modeling ; namely , applying the implicit function theorem , they prove that the perturbed rational expectations solution continuously depends on a parameter and therefore tends to the deterministic solution as the parameter tends to zero .",
    "almost all of the literature is concerned with the approximations around the steady state as in @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite make use of series expansion in powers of @xmath2 to provide a theoretical foundation for pruning methods @xcite , which is aimed to avoid the explosive behavior of a solution .",
    "@xcite develop the same approach for higher - order approximations .",
    "lombardo and uhlig s approach can be treated as a special case of the method proposed in the current study , namely a deterministic solution around which the expansion is used is only the steady state .",
    "both approaches based on the perturbation methodology used in applied mathematics ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the essence of the methodology is to expand a solution in a series of powers of a small parameter , and thus obtain a set of problems that can be solved recursively .",
    "it is supposed that each of this problems is easier to solve than the original one .",
    "actually in applied mathematics literature ( @xcite and @xcite ) , the zeroth - order approximation is typically a function of time @xmath3 rather than a steady state as in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* chapter 13 ) outlines how to apply perturbations around the known entire solution , which is not necessarily the steady state .",
    "he considers a simple continuous - time stochastic growth models in the dynamic programming framework .",
    "this paper develops an approach to construct approximate solutions to discrete - time dsge models in general form by using the perturbation method around a global deterministic path .    despite the fact that the pruning procedure avoids the explosive behavior of a solution ,",
    "it remains local , and as such may have some undesirable properties .",
    "for example , the pruning procedure might provide a first few impulse responses with wrong signs under a sufficiently large shock .",
    "this case seems even worse than the explosive dynamics since the impulse responses for a first few periods are most interesting and relevant for theoretical implications of a model as well as a policy analysis ; therefore , their incorrect signs could mislead a researcher or a policymaker . in this situation",
    "the pruning procedure just conceals the real problem . as we will show in the example , the problem with a wrong sign of impulse responses can occur even in a situation where the pruning is not needed .",
