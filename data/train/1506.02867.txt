    "ic 1613 is a local group dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "its proximity ( 0.72 mpc scowcroft et al . 2013 ) and isolation , together with its low foreground extinction ( e.g. foreground @xmath4 mag ; schlegel et al . 1998 ) have made it an attractive target for various programmes .",
    "studies of young stars show a metallicity similar to that of the smc , but with a low oxygen abundance ( garcia et al .",
    "2014 ; bouret et al .",
    "2015 ) , while older stars appear to be more metal - deficient ( e.g. skillman et al . 2014 ) .",
    "a recent investigation of the star formation history ( skillman et al . 2014 ) supports earlier suggestions that it has been constant over time , without any dominant phase of star formation .",
    "borissova et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied the distribution of luminous cool stars from @xmath5 and @xmath6-band imaging and found agb stars covering a wide range in age .",
    "albert , demers & kunkel ( 2000 ) conducted a narrow - band wide field survey of ic1613 for c and m stars , and found the ( intermediate age ) c stars extended out to 15 arcmin , well beyond the regions where star formation is currently active .",
    "bernard et al .",
    "( 2007 ) conducted a wide field optical survey of ic1613 , and traced red giant branch ( rgb ) stars out to a radius of 16.5 arcmin ( 3.6 kpc ) , showing the galaxy to be more extended than previously thought .",
    "sibbons et al .",
    "( 2015 ) use @xmath7 photometry to identify the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) at @xmath8 mag and to discuss the relative numbers of o- and c - rich agb stars .",
    "jackson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and boyer et al .",
    "( 2009 ; 2015 ) use spitzer mid - infrared photometry to discuss dust production and demonstrate that there are agb stars in ic1613 that are too red to be found by surveys at shorter wavelengths .",
    "various supergiants , including cepheids and other variables , were identified by sandage ( 1971 ) .",
    "spectra were taken of some by humphreys ( 1980 ) and infrared photometry obtained by elias & frogel ( 1985 ) .",
    "more recently surveys for variables have been made by saha et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , antonello et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) , mantegazza et al . ( 2001 ) , bernard et al . ( 2007 , 2010 ) and ogle ii ( soszyski et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the present work forms part of a broad study of agb variables in local group galaxies which so far has covered the dwarf spheroidals : leo  i ( menzies et al . 2002 ; 2010 ) , phoenix ( menzies et al .",
    "2008 ) , fornax ( whitelock et al . 2009 ) and sculptor ( menzies et al .",
    "2011 ) , as well as ngc6822 ( whitelock et al . 2013 ) , another dwarf irregular .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ sibbons ]",
    "in the discussion of distances below we follow the same procedure for determining bolometric magnitudes as in our previous papers because this will give us consistent values that are useful , at least , for estimating distances via the period luminosity ( pl ) relation .",
    "note that the caveats outlined at the start of section 7 of whitelock et al .",
    "( 2013 ) apply as much to the present work on ic1613 as they did to ngc6822 .",
    "the photometry was reddening corrected assuming @xmath9 mag , which makes some allowance for reddening internal to ic1613 ( e.g. georgiev et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "bolometric magnitudes for presumed c stars were calculated by applying a colour - dependent bolometric correction to the reddening - corrected @xmath6 magnitudes on the saao photometric system ( whitelock et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the carpenter ( 2001 ; web page updatejmc/2mass / v3/transformations/ ] ) formulation is used to transform from the 2mass system ( table  [ c_miras ] ) to the saao system .",
    "the resulting bolometric magnitudes are listed in the same table .",
    "fig.[fig_bolpl ] shows the pl relation .",
    "nine stars is insufficient to determine both a slope and a zero - point for the pl relation , so we assume that the slope of the pl - relation derived for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) will apply to ic1613 and use the expression : @xmath10 this enables us to determine the distance modulus of ic1613 with respect to the lmc , assuming that the lmc has @xmath11 mag ( feast 2013 ) .",
    "the fact that the slope of the pl relation determined for 50 stars in ncc6822 ( whitelock et a. 2013 ) was identical , within the uncertainties , to that of the lmc gives us confidence that this is a valid assumption .",
    "the distance modulus derived for ic1613 is @xmath12 mag , where the error is statistical and does not take into account any additional uncertainty in the slope of the pl relation or distance to the lmc . if we leave g3083 out of the solution , because of the uncertainty in its period , we derive @xmath13 mag .",
    "whilst this is the first estimate of the ic1613 distance from mira variables , there have been many attempts to derive it in other ways , e.g. , classical cepheids , rr lyrae variables , trgb , red clump .",
    "summaries have been given by , among others , bernard et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and scowcroft et al .",
    "bernard et al .",
    "( their fig .",
    "16 ) standardize previous results to an adopted lmc modulus of @xmath14 and a reddening of @xmath15 .",
    "they find a mean of various estimates to be @xmath16 , where we have converted their value to our adopted lmc distance modulus ( 18.50 mag ) .",
    "the quoted error is internal only .",
    "two recent multicolour studies of classical cepheids in ic1613 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006 , scowcroft et al .",
    "2013 ) , when adopting an lmc modulus of 18.50 , lead to @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( internal errors only ) , respectively , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "uncertainty in the reddening , illustrated by the three estimates given above , will obviously affect optical observations more severely than those in the near- or mid - infrared .",
    "some modulus derivations , including those obtained from optical observations of rr lyrae variables , rely on an adopted metallicity",
    ". others , including the classical cepheid determinations just mentioned , assume metallicity effects are negligible there is some evidence ( majaess et al . 2014 ) that the cepheids in the central region of ic1613 are affected by crowding .",
    "their results indicate that , allowing for such an effect by excluding cepheids in the crowded centre , would increase the cepheid distances just mentioned by @xmath21 mag . finally , although a common lmc modulus is adopted , there is no guarantee that all the lmc calibrators are at the same mean distance ( see for instance feast et al .",
    "given the above our current estimate of @xmath22 from miras is well within the uncertainties of other estimates . as in our previous work on other local group galaxies",
    ", this confirms the reliability of these objects as distance indicators .",
    "the pl(@xmath6 ) diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_kpl ] , where the line uses the distance modulus derived above in the relation for o - rich stars in the galaxy ( whitelock et al .",
    "2008 ) : @xmath23    in comparison to the pl(@xmath6 ) relation in ngc6822 ( whitelock et al .",
    "2013 fig 8) the absence of c stars below the pl relation is very noticeable .",
    "this is almost certainly a selection effect caused by the limited depth of our survey ; many of the redder sources we found in ngc6822 would not have been detected had they been at the distance of ic1613 and @xmath24 mag fainter .",
    "the fact that the luminous o - rich stars lie above the pl relationship in figs.[fig_kpl ] and [ fig_bolpl ] is another indication that these stars are undergoing hbb , supporting the conclusions from the presence of lithium ( section 4 ) and the isochrone fits ( section 9 ) .",
    "the implications of this are discussed further in the conclusion ( section 11 ) below .",
    ".,width=302 ]     period luminosity relation .",
    "o - rich and c - rich stars shown as open circles and closed circles respectively . the line is equation 5 with @xmath25.,width=302 ]",
    "it has already been established that star formation in ic1613 took place over a very long period ( skillman et al .",
    "2014 ) . our observations support this and indicate a clear young ( few @xmath26 yrs ) agb population , a significant population with ages up to a few @xmath27 yrs as well as indications of a much older ( @xmath28 gyr ) population . a deeper survey is required to say more about the older agb variables and to identify post - hbb stars with thick shells .",
    "it seems that ic1613 offers a potentially very interesting environment in which to test agb evolution and in particular the lifetimes and flux contributions from hbb and stars with high mass - loss rates .",
    "deeper and more detailed observations in the near - infrared and at longer wavelengths will be needed to provide an effective test of the models .",
    "this type of work could go some way to resolving the controversy associated with the fraction of light from intermediate age agb stars that is contributed to the integrated infrared flux of galaxies at moderate redshift ( e.g. , maraston et al . 2006 ; zibetti et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "selecting stars by @xmath3 colour rather than by their variability provides a distinctly different sample of agb stars and in particular misses some of the most luminous large amplitude o - rich agb stars",
    ". it will be important to recognize this in future .",
    "whitelock et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested that the luminous o - rich miras that lie above the pl relation in the lmc are hot bottom burning .",
    "the discovery of lithium in the spectrum of g3011 , a luminous mira in ic1613 , together with the ages implied from the isochrone fits to this and similar variables , provides strong support for this idea .",
    "it also leads us to suggest that more attention should be given to stars with large amplitude pulsations that lie above the fundamental pl relation .",
    "these may be pulsating in the first overtone ( feast 2009 ) and , unlike fundamental pulsators , are not at the end of their agb evolution .",
    "the marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) isochrones indicate that they have a great deal of mass to loose before becoming white dwarfs .",
    "it seem possible that they evolve into oh / ir stars , or possibly extreme c - stars , at a later stage after hbb terminates . as oh / ir stars they would have much longer periods , be enshrouded in dust , and presumably pulsate in the fundamental mode .",
    "this work demonstrates that a small ( 1.4 m ) telescope can be used to make a very reasonable estimate of the distances to mira variables at around 750kpc .",
    "it will obviously be possible to use larger telescopes to get a bigger sample of agb variables in ic1613 and make a more accurate distance measurement .",
    "this paper is based on observations made with the southern african large telescope ( salt ) and the irsf and makes use of observations from the lcogt network .",
