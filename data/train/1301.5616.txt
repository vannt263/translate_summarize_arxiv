    "the first observing runs of the advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( aligo ) are expected in @xmath4 , with advanced virgo following on a similar schedule  @xcite .",
    "the primary source for these observatories is the coalescence of binaries containing black holes and/or neutron stars , with predicted rates between a few and several hundred per year at detector design sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "the components of these binaries are formed in supernovae when the core of a massive star collapses to a compact remnant , although the exact collapse mechanism remains unknown .",
    "detailed knowledge of the mass distribution of black holes and neutron stars will provide vital clues to their formation as well as explore the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter at high densities .",
    "measuring the upper and lower limits of neutron - star masses allows us to constrain the supernova engine and the nuclear physics of neutron - star remnants  @xcite .",
    "for example , the collapse of low - mass stars ( @xmath5 ) is believed to quickly produce explosions with very little mass accreted in a convective engine phase .",
    "the predicted mass of the compact remnant will be less than the chandrasekhar mass by an amount that depends on the collapse model  @xcite .",
    "if we can place an upper limit on the mass of a low mass neutron star ( in the @xmath6 range ) , we can distinguish between current models , effectively using these low - mass systems to constrain the eos and neutrino physics in core - collapse . at higher masses , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have argued that there is a gap between @xmath7 where no compact objects exist .",
    "if true , the amount of material that falls back onto the newly formed compact remnant must be small , arguing against engine mechanisms that take a long time ( more than 200ms ) to develop  @xcite .",
    "however , this mass gap may simply be an artifact of poor mass resolution of x - ray binaries and poor statistics  @xcite .",
    "black - hole mass distributions will allow us to explore the fall - back of material in a weak supernova explosion and black - hole masses in solar metallicity environments will provide clues into stellar mass loss . with an accurate black - hole mass distribution , we can study these open questions in stellar evolution .",
    "the binary s gravitational - wave phasing depends at leading order on its chirp mass @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the binary s component masses  @xcite ; this quantity will be most accurately measured in a gravitational - wave detection .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath11 enters through higher - order corrections and is less accurately measured ; see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "there is also a partial degeneracy between the mass ratio and the angular momentum @xmath12 of each compact object ( the spin ) , which further limits our ability to measure the binary s component masses .",
    "heuristically , this can be understood as follows : a binary with spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum will inspiral more slowly than a non - spinning system . similarly ,",
    "a binary of the same _ total mass _ but with more extreme mass ratio will inspiral more slowly .",
    "however , a binary with the same _ chirp mass _ but with more extreme mass ratio will inspiral more quickly . the effect on the waveform of decreasing @xmath13 can be mimicked by increasing the component spins .",
    "we investigate the accuracy with which the component masses can be determined from gravitational - wave observations of binary - neutron - star ( bns ) , neutron - star  black - hole ( nsbh ) , and binary - black - hole ( bbh ) systems , focussing on systems where the object s spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum . since the first signals detected by aligo are likely to have signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) close to the observable network threshold of @xmath1412  @xcite , we focus on signals with snrs 1020 , which will account for @xmath1480% of observations . for these snrs , we find that the mass - ratio  spin degeneracy will prevent us from accurately measuring component masses .",
    "we identify the region of the mass parameter space for which it will not be possible to determine whether the compact objects are black holes or neutron stars using gravitational - wave observations alone , when we can conclusively measure compact - object masses outside the currently observed limits , and show how the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart to an nsbh could be used to constrain the black - hole spin .",
    "fisher - matrix methods show that the binary s chirp mass is recovered well by matched filtering , with accuracies of @xmath15 for typical bns systems in aligo  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the neutron stars are nonspinning @xmath13 can be measured to an accuracy of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "estimates of the effect of the mass - ratio  spin degeneracy were first made by @xcite and @xcite using the fisher approach .",
    "the degeneracy between the mass ratio and the total effective spin @xmath17 degrades the ability to measure the mass ratio and hence the component masses .",
    "we go beyond these studies , using the method introduced in @xcite to equate a confidence interval with a region where the match between the signal and model waveforms exceeds a given threshold .",
    "we use this method to investigate parameter degeneracies for a wide range of binaries and interpret the expected measurement accuracy in the context of the astrophysical questions discussed above .",
    "we model the waveforms with the taylorf2 inspiral approximant @xcite to leading order in amplitude and 3.5 post - newtonian ( pn ) order in phase  @xcite with spin - orbit terms to 3.5pn order and spin terms to 2pn order  @xcite . for systems with total masses below @xmath18 ,",
    "our results with taylorf2 are consistent with those from phenomenological bbh models that include the merger and ringdown  @xcite , calibrated against numerical - relativity waveforms with mass ratios up to 1:4  @xcite . for the higher - mass bbh results in sec .",

    "[ fig : bns ] shows the regions of the mass plane that are consistent with this source at 90% confidence for snrs 10 and 20 .",
    "the component masses consistent with the signal lie roughly along a line of constant chirp mass .",
    "however , there is significant spread in the recovered component masses due to the degeneracy between @xmath13 and @xmath34 in the gravitational - wave phase evolution .",

    "although any configuration along this line is of interest , we can not strongly constrain the component masses with gravitational - wave observations at low snr . in particular , even if we assume that neutron stars are nonspinning and that the minimum bh mass is 3@xmath52 , we can not rule out that the possibility that it is a nsbh system : our assumption would only remove the portion of the confidence interval with @xmath68 , and the observation would be of _ either _ a bns system with well - constrained masses , _ or _ an nsbh .",
    "finally , we consider a binary with component masses at the upper end of the neutron - star mass limit , above which we expect the components to be black holes . in this case",
    ", we could conclusively say that one of the components must be a black hole , although the degeneracy limits our ability to draw strong conclusions on the component masses .",
