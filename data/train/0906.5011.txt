    "for the 2nd subaru international conference on `` exoplanets and disks : their formation and diversity '' , the goal of my introductory talk was to succinctly summarize some recent observational constraints on the parameters describing circumstellar disks relevant to planet formation .",
    "rather than give short shrift to many subtopics within too few pages , i have elected to focus this manuscript on only one aspect of disk evolution : _ primordial disk lifetimes_. for reviews on recent results on other aspects of circumstellar disk evolution , i refer the reader to the other reviews in this volume that were presented at the kona meeting : especially those on disk geometry and coronagraphic polarimetry by m. perrin , observations of debris disks by a. moro - martn , dynamical theory of planets , planetesimals , and dust by m. wyatt , imaging debris disks by p. kalas , modeling circumstellar disks by s. wolf , spectroscopy of disks by m. goto , characterizing gas and dust around main sequence stars by c. chen , and dust growth in disks by h. tanaka . for more exhaustive recent reviews on circumstellar disks around young stars ,",
    "i refer the reader to the book by @xcite , and the reviews by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "investigations of circumstellar disks and extrasolar planets have experienced explosive ( and seemingly parallel ) growth over the past two decades .",
    "our knowledge of extrasolar planets has been driven mostly by enhanced techniques of optical spectroscopy ( e.g. doppler surveys ) , and more recently , photometry ( e.g. transits , microlensing ) .",
    "our knowledge regarding circumstellar disks orbiting young stars has been driven mostly by infrared and millimeter photometry and imaging , and more recently , spectroscopy ( with obvious contributions to understanding accretion from optical spectroscopy ) .",
    "protoplanetary disks set the initial conditions of planet formation , and to understand the diversity of planetary systems , we need to understand the physics , chemistry , and evolution of primordial disks .",
    "the existence of primordial disks around young stars was originally inferred through the spectroscopic evidence for accretion among classical t tauri stars ( @xmath42 m@xmath3 pre - main sequence stars ) and evidence of circumstellar dust structures , later confirmed to be geometrically distributed as disks ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "classical t tauri stars have typical isochronal ages of @xmath45 myr , typical accretion rates of @xmath010@xmath510@xmath6 m@xmath3yr@xmath7 @xcite , disk masses of @xmath05 @xmath8 10@xmath9 m@xmath3 ( @xmath00.5 dex dispersion ) , and median disk / star mass ratios of @xmath00.5% @xcite . among the classical t tauri star populations in star - forming regions are weak - line t tauri stars  pre - ms stars lacking spectroscopic of accretion and/or photometric evidence for circumstellar dust .",
    "the disk masses inferred for weak - lined t tauri stars from submillimeter observations are almost always @xmath410@xmath10 m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "integration of the minimum - mass solar nebula model over the range of orbital radii for planets in our solar system leads to a disk mass of @xmath010@xmath11 m@xmath3 , ( i.e. @xmath02@xmath8 the typical disk mass inferred for classical t tauri stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that by the time low - mass stars evolve to the weak - line t tauri phase their disk surface density is likely to be at least an order of magnitude too low to form planets like jupiter and saturn . by ages of @xmath010 myr , samples of typical solar - type stars appear to have less than @xmath4tens of m@xmath12 of gas within a few au , and @xmath4few m@xmath12 of circumstellar gas at orbital radii of @xmath010 - 40 au @xcite .",
    "early in the protostar s life , the disk ( and protostar ) are fed by infall from a vast molecular envelope associated with cloud cores .",
    "the molecular clouds forming embedded star clusters appear to disperse within @xmath03 myr of star formation @xcite , effectively removing the source of dense gas feeding primordial circumstellar disks .",
    "the mechanisms for removing reservoirs of circumstellar gas are numerous , including viscous accretion radially inward toward the star ( with some material subsequently ejected outward via jet ) , outward viscous decretion ( through conservation of angular momentum ) , accretion into planets , photoevaporation by the central star , or even photoevaporation by a neighboring star @xcite . given the numerous mechanisms for dispersing primordial disks , it is perhaps unsurprising that we find that typical disk lifetimes are similar to the brief timescale when the protostar is immersed in a sea of dense molecular gas .    while the longevity of the sun s protoplanetary disk is unknown ,",
    "there are weak constraints .",
    "detailed modeling of the geophysical , thermal , and rotational evolution of saturn s outermost large , regular satellite iapetus by @xcite requires that iapetus accreted most of its mass within @xmath03.45.4 myral decay . ] after the formation of the solar system ( defined by the formation of ca - al - rich inclusions 4,567.2@xmath130.6 myr ago ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that saturn itself had accreted the majority of its mass ( which is at least @xmath06780% hydrogen & helium ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the sun s protoplanetary disk within @xmath03.45.4 myr .",
    "variations of the ` nice model ' by @xcite can form the gas giants jupiter and saturn through core accretion , form uranus and neptune as ` failed ' gas giants in the @xmath0510 au zone , and scatter them to near their current orbital radii  all within 5 myr  for models where the disk surface density is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the canonical @xcite minimum - mass solar nebula .",
    "these results suggest that the formation of giant planets is at least plausible within the @xmath010@xmath14 yr lifetime of gas - rich protoplanetary disks , given the observed physical properties of observed primordial disks .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic observations appear to be telling us that the circumstellar disks of young stars undergo radically divergent evolutionary paths at a very young age .",
    "early @xmath03 - 4@xmath15 m surveys suggested @xcite , and recent spitzer surveys of nearby young stellar groups have confirmed @xcite , that primordial accretion disks around lower - mass stars tend to last longer than around higher - mass stars .",
    "however within a given mass range , there appears to be quite a dispersion in disk lifetimes .",
    "shorter disk lifetimes have been demonstrated for stars which are higher in mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in multiple systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which are in the immediate vicinity ( @xmath40.5 pc ) of o - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or are in denser stellar clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence there appear to be multiple variables affecting primordial disk lifetimes .",
    "although the well - cited disk survey of @xcite pointed towards a maximum disk lifetime of 6 myr , we now know of many convincing examples of older accretors : multiple examples in the @xmath0610 myr - old @xmath16 cha , tw hya , and 25 ori groups , the accretor pds 66 in lower cen crux ( stellar age @xmath1717 myr ) , and the unusual binary sth@xmath17 34 ( @xmath0825 myr ) @xcite .    a modern version of the `` haisch - lada@xmath18 plot '' ( disk fraction vs. sample age ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diskfrac ] .",
    "while the observational definitions of what constitutes a star with a probable primordial accretion disk can vary slightly from study to study , this plot represents a best effort to summarize the situation with the data available . as demonstrated by @xcite from the sample of known t tauri stars in taurus @xcite , 3 - 4@xmath15 m excesses trace spectroscopically identified classical t tauri stars @xmath0100% of time , while @xmath02@xmath15 m excesses trace classical t tauri stars only @xmath070% of the time .",
    "similarly , @xcite detected 3.6@xmath15 m excess emission solely around previously known classical t tauri stars among a large sample of fgk - type stars with ages @xmath03 myr to @xmath03 gyr . with these findings in mind ,",
    "i consider stars to be accretors whether they are ( 1 ) spectroscopically identified as classical t tauri stars ( through a h@xmath17 emission criterion ) , and/or ( 2 ) through l - band or spitzer 3.6@xmath15 m excess , and/or ( 3 ) their emission beyond 3.6@xmath15 m was classified by the authors as being likely due to primordial disk due to the sed shape or strength of the ir excess .",
    "the nature of some disks is unclear . @xcite and others have identified stars with weak ir excesses whose nature as stars with either accretion disks of lower optical depth or simply warm dusty debris disks is at present ambiguous . given the rarity of `` transition disks '' ( disks with large inner holes ) , their inclusion or exclusion is usually within the disk fraction uncertainties , and will have negligible impact on this analysis .",
    "the fraction of stars in the transition phase has been noted to be very high in a young sample ( e.g. @xmath01 myr cra ; * ? ? ?",
    "i have not yet attempted to disentangle the effects of stellar mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : diskfrac ] , so the reader should simply interpret the disk fractions as being most representative of the low - mass population of stars ( @xmath42 m@xmath3 ) as they dominate the stellar samples .",
    "i have omitted results for more distant clusters whose disk fraction statistics were completely dominated by high mass stars ( @xmath212 m@xmath3 ) .",
    "ages and age uncertainties are taken from the published studies , however minimum age uncertainties of @xmath131 myr or @xmath1330% ( whichever is greater ) were adopted if uncertainties were not quoted .",
    "the usual caveats exist for the ages plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diskfrac ] .",
    "there are significant differences in the ages estimated using different evolutionary tracks , and even as a function of mass for a single set of tracks @xcite , and none of the tracks have consistently matched predictions of masses with dynamically - constrained masses over the stellar mass spectrum .",
    "[ fig : diskfrac ] demonstrates that any statements regarding the lifetimes of primordial disks need to be statistical in nature .",
    "statements to the effect that `` all disks disappear '' by @xmath03 or @xmath06 myr are oversimplified assessments .",
    "i have decided to be provocative and plot an exponential function to fit the data .",
    "an exponential is convenient as it has a value of one at age zero ( assuming that all stars are born with disks ) , trends towards zero as age increases ( all primordial accretion disks eventually disappear ) , and one only needs to fit one parameter ( the e - folding timescale @xmath19 ) . when simultaneously minimizing the residuals in the disk fraction and age ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diskfrac ] ) , i arrive at a best fit timescale of @xmath19 = 2.5 myr .",
    "unfortunately the best fit has reduced @xmath20 @xmath1 2.5 , suggesting that either ( 1 ) the uncertainties in the assessed disk fractions and ages are significantly underestimated ( by factor of @xmath21 @xmath1 1.6 ) , and/or ( 2 ) there are significant cluster - to - cluster differences in disk fraction decay time , and/or ( 3 ) an exponential function is simply inadequate for fitting the trend . as cluster - to - cluster variations have been demonstrated  especially at age @xmath05 myr @xcite , and cluster ages are especially uncertain , i suspect that these two factors are the primary causes of the high @xmath22 of the best fit .",
    "removing individual clusters from the fit varies @xmath19 by @xmath410% , which is probably a reasonable estimate of the precision in @xmath19 given our current knowledge of the ages of these star - forming regions .",
    "recent spitzer surveys have quoted disk fractions as a function of stellar mass in cluster samples .",
    "we can now look at these data in a different way , and combine the various results and quote a single metric ( @xmath19 ) to more concisely summarize the observed trend and allow comparison between non - coeval samples .",
    "the exponential decay formalism is convenient for calculating e - folding times for various subsamples where we have sparse data available .",
    "if disk fraction evolves as an exponential decay , and a cluster of a given age is observed to have a disk fraction that is assumed to lie on that decay curve , one can estimate the primordial disk decay timescale from that subsample :      where @xmath24 is the age of the sample , and @xmath25 is the observed disk fraction . using this technique",
    ", i will estimate preliminary values of @xmath19 for stellar subsamples segregated by stellar mass .",
    "_ what is the characteristic timescale for the primordial disks around brown dwarfs ?",
    "_ results from early surveys identifying 3 - 4@xmath15 m excesses among small samples of substellar objects hinted that half of all disks were likely dispersed within @xmath013 myr @xcite .",
    "more recent disk fractions for larger samples of substellar objects have been quoted in a series of papers by luhman and collaborators , notably for ic 348 ( @xmath24 = 2.5 myr ; @xmath25 = 42% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cha i ( @xmath24 @xmath1 2.5 myr ;",

    "to this set , i include the disk fraction of substellar objects in upper sco ( @xmath24 = 5 myr ) from @xcite , which ranged from @xmath0520% depending on whether the accretors were defined via spectroscopic or photometric techniques ( we assume 12.5@xmath137.5 % ) .",
    "note that the individual @xmath25 values have uncertainties of @xmath0720% , which translate into significant errors in @xmath19 , especially for small @xmath25 . using equation [ eqn : taudisk ] ,",
    "these disk fractions and ages translate into decay timescales of @xmath19 @xmath1 2.9 , 2.9 , 5.9 , and 2.4 myr , for ic 348 , cha i , @xmath26 ori , and upper sco , respectively .",
    "these results suggest that the typical primordial disk decay timescale for brown dwarfs is approximately @xmath19 @xmath1 3 myr ",
    "i.e. marginally longer than for stellar samples ( @xmath02.5 myr ) .",
    "_ what is the characteristic decay timescale for primordial disks around high mass stars ? _ the small disk fractions , and low numbers of high mass stars in stellar groups , make this surprisingly difficult to quantify .",

    "these results are also broadly consistent with the frequency of @xmath22m@xmath3 herbig ae / be stars in nearby associations @xcite .",
    "it is possible that @xmath19 could be used as a _ very _ coarse age estimator for multi - wavelength investigations of distant star - forming regions imaged both in the infrared and in x - rays where there is an estimate of the young stellar population both with primordial disks ( class o / i / ii objects ) and without ( class iii objects ) .",

    "this estimate would only provide the coarsest of ages ( as we now have evidence that disk lifetimes are dependent on stellar mass and environment ) , however in the quest for useful stellar age estimators , even the bluntest of diagnostics can be helpful .    in summary , it is clear from _ spitzer _ surveys that the lifetime of primordial disks is not only a function of age , but stellar mass , multiplicity , and proximity to o - type stars .",
