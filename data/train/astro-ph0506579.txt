    "galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe .",
    "they typically contain several hundreds to thousands of galaxies orbiting in a gravitational potential well formed primarily by dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they are also filled with hot gas with @xmath4 kev that loses thermal energy prolifically by emitting x - rays . in the absence of any heat sources ,",
    "the radiative cooling in the cores of rich clusters would result in a cooling flow in which gas settles in the gravitational potential and drops out as cold condensations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent high resolution _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations have not shown the expected signature of gas cooling below one - third of the virial temperature @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that there must be some source of heat that manages to balance the radiative cooling and thus prevents the mass dropout at the central regions of galaxy clusters .",
    "most theoretical models proposed so far for cluster heating fall into the following two groups : ( 1 ) energy injection via radiations , jets , outflows , bubbles , or sound waves from a central active galactic nucleus ( @xcite and references therein ) ; ( 2 ) diffusive transport of heat from the outer regions of the cluster to the center via conduction @xcite or turbulent mixing @xcite .",
    "although less well studied than those mentioned above , there are clearly other energy sources in the cluster environments .",
    "these include kinetic energy in the orbital motions of galaxies @xcite , gravitational potential energy of the gas @xcite , feedback from intracluster supernovae @xcite , dissipation of turbulent energy driven by infall of subclusters @xcite , etc .",
    "amount of available energy in each source is comparable to or larger than thermal energy of the intracluster medium ( icm ) , so that radiative cooling would be easily offset if there exist physical mechanisms that can tap the energy from the sources and convert it into thermal energy in the icm .",
    "one such process is dynamical fiction ( df ) which occurs when a galaxy moving around a cluster center interacts with its gravitationally induced wake in the icm ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because of the gravitational drag , the galaxy loses some of its kinetic energy .",
    "turbulence in the icm generated by the superposition of the wakes of many galaxies or by other processes will absorb the lost kinetic energy and , in the presence of tangled magnetic fields and/or viscosity , turns it into heat at the dissipation scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite independently estimated the heating rates by df of galaxies and found that the df - induced heating can fairly well balance radiative cooling of a rich cluster , provided the mass - to - light ratio is about 20 . using updated data for the properties of galaxies and gas in the perseus cluster and employing monte - carlo approaches , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ekk04 ) very recently showed that the total power generated by df within the cooling radius is comparable to radiative loss from that region if the average mass - to - light ratio of galaxies is about 10 .",
    "they also noted that this mechanism is self - regulating in the sense that gas would not be overheated since the df of galaxies becomes ineffective when it attains high enough temperature for which galaxy motions become subsonic ( see also @xcite ) .    while the results of the aforementioned work suggest that the _ total _ power supplied by the motions of member galaxies is comparable to x - ray luminosity of a typical rich cluster , it is sill uncertain whether it can balance the radiative cooling _",
    "locally _ as well . if the df of galaxy motions is to serve as a primary heat supplier in clusters in equilibrium , observed density and temperature profiles of clusters should be a natural consequence of the local heat balance between radiative cooling and df - induced heating .",
    "since optically - thin , x - ray emitting gas is prone to thermal instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is also an interesting question whether the df - induced heating is able to suppress thermal instability completely or at least lengthen its growth time to the level comparable to the ages of clusters ; even an equilibrium cluster would otherwise be subject to a mass dropout at its center @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we take one step further from @xcite and ekk04 to investigate equilibrium cluster models in which df - induced heating is a main heating mechanism .",
    "we will first construct density and temperature distributions of the gas in clusters that are in strict hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium and compare them with observed profiles .",
    "we note that recent x - ray data from _ bepposax _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton _ observations indicate that gas temperature in rich clusters rapidly increases with radius for @xmath5 , remains roughly isothermal up to @xmath6 , and then gradually declines farther out ( @xcite , see also @xcite for _ asca _ results ) . here",
    ", @xmath7 is a virial radius the interior of which has the mean density of gas equal to 180 times the critical density . while declining temperature profiles at large radii may provide important clues to cosmological structure formation",
    ", they appear not to be directly relevant to the cooling flow problem . this is because gas density in clusters decreases as or faster than @xmath8 at the outer parts , so that the radiative cooling time in the @xmath9 regions are much longer than the hubble time .",
    "indeed , the results of numerical simulations for cluster formation show that the shapes of declining temperature profiles are essentially independent of the presence of radiative cooling and/or supernova feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for this reason ,",
    "when we compare our model results with observations , we pay attention to density and temperature profiles only in cooling regions with @xmath10 ( typically @xmath11 mpc ) beyond which the effect of radiative cooling is not serious and thus heating mechanisms are not required .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we evaluate the total heating rate resulting from the df of galaxies using the formula given by @xcite for gravitational drag force in a gaseous medium . while @xcite and ekk04 approximated galaxy motions as being highly supersonic ,",
    "we allow for both subsonic and supersonic motions of galaxies . in ",
    "3 we calculate equilibrium density and temperature profiles of galaxy clusters by assuming that the df - induced heating is deposited at the locations of galaxies .",
    "effects of distributed heating of df and the radial mass variation of galaxies are discussed in  4 . in ",
    "5 we analyze local thermal stability of the gas while in  6 we present the results of numerical hydrodynamic simulations that investigate the evolution of initially out of equilibrium configurations . finally ,",
    "in  7 we conclude this work and discuss other potential consequences of df of galaxies in clusters .",
    "galaxies orbiting around the center of a galaxy cluster gravitationally induce wakes in the icm .",
    "the gravitational interaction between the galaxies and wakes causes the former to lose their orbital kinetic energy and converts it into thermal energy of the icm via either compressional heating ( including shock ) or turbulent dissipation of the gas kinetic energy in the wakes .",
    "although the notion that df of galaxies can generate heat in the hot icm has been well recognized and widely studied , most of previous work on this subject assumed galaxies in highly supersonic motions , estimated only total heating rate , and compared it with total radiative loss rate in clusters ( @xcite ; ekk04 ) .",
    "however , the motions of galaxies are only slightly supersonic , with an average mach number of about 1.5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and even become subsonic at the outer parts of clusters . in this paper",
    "we consider both subsonic and supersonic galaxy motions and adopt the general formula of @xcite for the df force in a gaseous medium .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a galaxy of mass @xmath12 moving at velocity @xmath13 through a uniform medium with density @xmath14 and sound speed @xmath15 . the dynamical - friction force that the galaxy experiences is given by @xmath16 where the efficiency factor @xmath17 is defined by @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the mach number of the galaxy motion and @xmath20 the effective size of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath21 , equations ( [ fdf ] ) and ( [ i ] ) with @xmath22 corresponding to the maximum system size , become identical to the @xcite formula for the drag force due to collisionless particles .",
    "although equation ( [ fdf ] ) is valid for a perturber moving on rectilinear trajectory through a uniform - density medium , numerical simulations show that it is a good approximation even in a radially - stratified , spherical system @xcite .",
    "we assume that the orbital velocities of @xmath23 galaxies that contribute to heating of the gas are described by the maxwellian distribution , @xmath24 with a one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath25",
    ". the total heating rate due to the df is then given by @xmath26 where the angular brackets denote an average over equation ( [ maxwell ] ) .",
    "using equations ( [ i ] ) and ( [ maxwell ] ) , one can evaluate @xmath27 numerically .",
    "figure [ i_over_m ] plots @xmath27 as functions of @xmath28 for some values of @xmath29 . for supersonic cases ,",
    "the density perturbations in the wake are highly asymmetric and the regions influenced by the perturber shrink as @xmath30 increases .",
    "this results in a smaller heating rate for larger @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", one can show @xmath31 for @xmath32 . for a subsonically moving perturber ,",
    "on the other hand , the perturbed density in the front and back sides of the perturber becomes more or less symmetric , producing a smaller heating rate with decreasing @xmath30 . in the limit of vanishingly small @xmath30 , @xmath33 .",
    "in general , @xmath27 peaks at @xmath34 , as figure [ i_over_m ] indicates .    taking @xmath35 mpc from a typical size of clusters and @xmath36 kpc as the galaxy size , @xmath37 . since @xmath30 usually varies from 0.8 to 3 , @xmath38 . therefore , we have the total heating rate @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the electron number density and gas temperature , respectively , and we adopt the solar abundance .",
    "notice that the rate of gas heating given in equation ( [ num ] ) is similar to typical x - ray luminosity of rich clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that there is a sufficient amount of energy available in the orbital motions of galaxies .",
    "this is essentially what led ekk04 to conclude that the dynamical - friction coupling between cluster galaxies and gas can provide thermal energy enough to compensate for radiative loss .",
    "however , it is still questionable whether df of galaxies heats the gas in a right manner .",
    "that is , are the observed density and temperature profiles of the icm a direct consequence of energy balance between heating by df and radiative cooling ? is the intracluster gas heated by df thermally stable ? in what follows , we shall study models of clusters with df - induced heating in detail by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and thermal energy balance .",
    "df of galaxies is mediated by gravity which is a long - range force , so that heating of gas due to a single galaxy is likely to be well distributed throughout its wake .",
    "the functional form of heat distribution is unknown and its derivation may require numerical simulations , which are beyond the scope of the present work . in this section , we instead make a simplifying assumption that heat is deposited _ locally _ at the galaxy position .",
    "the effects of heat distribution will be discussed in  4 .",
    "consider a spherically symmetric distribution of galaxies , with the number density given by @xmath42 at radius @xmath43 .",
    "the local heating rate per unit volume due to df is given by @xmath44 where we assume equal galaxy mass .",
    "to find @xmath42 , we assume that the orbits of galaxies are isotropic and isothermal .",
    "the usual jeans equation ( e.g. , eq .  [ 4 - 55 ] of @xcite ) then reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the gravitational potential .    under the nfw distribution of dark matter @xmath47 with a scale radius @xmath48 and a characteristic mass @xmath49 , the gravitational acceleration is given by @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the dimensionless radius @xcite .",

    "while the functional form of @xmath57 looks strange , it behaves quite well near @xmath58 and gives density profiles similar to the isothermal @xmath59-model of gas distributions @xcite or to the king model of the observed galaxy distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite found that the best - fit distribution of galaxies in a1795 is @xmath60^{-1.27}$ ] with a core radius @xmath61 pc , which is plotted as a solid line in figure [ den_comp ] . on the other hand , x - ray and optical observations",
    "indicate @xmath62 , @xmath63 kpc , and @xmath64 for a1795 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "figure [ den_comp ] plots as a dotted line the @xmath57 curve with @xmath66 , which is in good agreement with the observed galaxy distribution .",
    "we take @xmath67 as the outer boundary of a cluster . inserting equation ( [ ng ] ) into equation ( [ edotr ] ) , one obtains @xmath68 where @xmath69 kpc ) , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the temperature of the gas in units of kev .",
    "equation ( [ edot ] ) is our desired equation for the volume heating rate due to the df of galaxies .",
    "note that @xmath73 at @xmath74 and depends on temperature .",
    "we look for cluster density and temperature distributions in which the hot gas satisfies both hydrostatic equilibrium and energy balance between radiative cooling and df - induced heating . for thermal bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the rate of energy loss per unit volume is given by @xmath75 @xcite . from equations ( [ edot ] ) and ( [ j ] ) ,",
    "the condition of thermal energy balance yields @xmath76 neglecting the weak temperature dependence of @xmath77 and assuming that @xmath12 does not vary with radius , equation ( [ net ] ) states that the gas pressure in equilibrium should trace the distribution of galaxies .",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas requires @xmath78 where @xmath79 is an _",
    "sound speed at @xmath80 .",

    "can then be found from equation ( [ net ] ) .",
    "since @xmath83 depends rather sensitively on less - well known quantities such and @xmath23 and @xmath84 and is easily influenced by the mass profile of galaxies , we concentrate on @xmath82 that is independent of the properties of galaxies other than @xmath25 .    equation ( [ diff ] ) has a trivial isothermal solution @xmath85 independent of the radius .",
    "the corresponding density profile is @xmath86 where @xmath87 , indicating that the gas density follows the galaxy distribution exactly .",
    "considering uncertainties in the values of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , if the contribution from dark halos is taken into account ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "equation ( [ nsol ] ) gives @xmath92 at the cluster centers , which is not much different from observed values .",
    "note that the mach number corresponding to @xmath0 is @xmath93 . for later purposes ,",
    "we define the transonic temperature @xmath94 corresponding to unity mach number of galaxy motions .    the isothermal solution ( [ tsol ] ) is consistent with what has long been known as the scaling relation between the gas temperature and the velocity dispersion of galaxies for many clusters ( e.g. , @xcite , see also @xcite for review ) .",
    "it explains why the values of the @xmath59 @xmath95 parameter in the @xmath59 models for gas distributions are close to unity @xcite .",
    "physically , the scaling relation implies that the plasma and the galaxies are well relaxed under the common gravitational potential .",
    "it is uncertain whether the observed scaling law results truly from the df coupling between the icm and galaxies , but equation ( [ tsol ] ) suggests that the latter certainly makes the former tighter .",
    "although gas in the regions surrounding cooling cores of clusters has nearly constant temperatures close to the virial values , recent x - ray observations exhibit positive radial gradients of gas temperatures at the central @xmath96 kpc regions @xcite , while showing declining temperature distributions at far outer regions @xcite .",
    "thus , the isothermal solution can not describe the observed temperature distributions for the whole range of radii .",
    "we are particularly interested in the regions within and adjacent to the cooling radius in which gas density is high enough to experience significant radiative cooling .",
    "to check whether the general solutions of equation ( [ diff ] ) produce temperature and density distributions similar to the observed in such regions , we solve it numerically .",
    "we adopt @xmath66 , @xmath63 kpc , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 corresponding to @xmath100 kev .",
    "we choose a value for the central temperature @xmath101 and then integrate equation ( [ diff ] ) from @xmath102 to @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting temperature and density profiles for a few selected values of @xmath101 are plotted in figure [ local ] .",
    "the spatial behavior of the solutions depends critically on @xmath101 .",
    "when @xmath103 , galaxy motions are subsonic and @xmath104 from figure [ i_over_m ] .",
    "if @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) , equation ( [ diff ] ) gives @xmath107 for @xmath105 , implying @xmath108 .",
    "as temperature monotonically decreases with radius , @xmath30 increases until it reaches the isothermal value @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "one can similarly show that @xmath111 for @xmath112 , and thus temperature slowly increases toward @xmath0 .",
    "as long as @xmath103 , the solutions asymptote to the isothermal ones ( eqs .  [ [ tsol ] ] and [ [ nsol ] ] ) as the radius increases . on the other hand , @xmath108",
    "when @xmath113 ( or @xmath114 ) .",
    "since @xmath30 increases with decreasing @xmath41 and since @xmath115 does not change its sign for @xmath114 , @xmath108 is satisfied for all radii .",
    "the decrease of temperature is much faster than that of @xmath57 , resulting in a unrealistic distribution of electron number density that increases with radius .    as figure [ local ] shows , the local heat balance with df - induced heating yields rising temperature profiles , if and only if @xmath116 .",
    "while this is a tantalizing result considering the central depression of temperatures seen in cooling - flow clusters , the required range of temperatures is very narrow .",
    "if we identify @xmath0 with the virial temperature , the central temperatures in our equilibrium models must be larger than @xmath117 ( for @xmath118 ) , which is about twice larger than the observed values of @xmath119 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by having too stringent upper and lower limits of temperatures ,",
    "therefore , heating by df of galaxies alone is unlikely to explain observed temperature and density distributions of galaxy clusters .",
    "we note however that the tight range of temperatures for the rising temperature profiles may be caused by the basic assumptions of this section , namely that df - induced heating of the icm is all localized at the positions of galaxies , and that all galaxies have equal mass .",
    "we relax these assumptions in the next section .",
    "in the presence of viscosity and/or turbulent magnetic fields in the icm , the kinetic energy lost by a galaxy via df will eventually be converted into heat , rather than bulk motions distributed onto the gravitational wakes of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite used a quasi - linear fluctuation theory to derive the spatial structure ( in fourier space ) of mechanical heating in a turbulent medium self - consistently driven by df of many galaxies .",
    "to our knowledge , there is no published work that study spatial heat distribution ( in real space ) caused by df . if icm heating by df of galaxies occurs through turbulent dissipation of gas kinetic energy , finding the functional form of the heat distribution would not be viable unless the characteristics of icm turbulence and related processes are prescribed @xcite . instead of attempting to derive a realistic heat distribution , in this work we simply adopt a gaussian function to parametrize the spatial extent to which heat is distributed .",
    "our aim in this section is to examine the effects of heat distribution on equilibrium structures in comparison with the localized heating models . since masses of galaxies inside a cluster are likely to vary with the radius within the cluster , we also allow for spatially varying galaxy masses .",
    "assuming that heat distribution follows a gaussian profile centered at the location of the galaxy , we write the heating rate per unit volume as @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a convolution of @xmath122 with the gaussian function with scale length @xmath123 . in writing equations ( [ dist_edotr ] ) and ( [ conv ] )",
    ", we assume that density and temperature of the gas do not change significantly inside the wake of a galaxy , which is acceptable within the framework of equation ( [ fdf ] ) .",
    "the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium and thermal energy balance is then reduced to @xmath124   - \\frac{d\\ln h(x)}{dx}.\\ ] ] it can be easily verified that equation ( [ diff2 ] ) recovers equation ( [ diff ] ) in the limit of @xmath125 .",
    "figure [ disth ] plots the solutions of equation ( [ diff2 ] ) for the case of constant @xmath12 .",
    "more widely distributed heating is equivalent to localized heating with a flatter distribution of galaxy number density , causing the @xmath126 term in equation ( [ diff2 ] ) to be smaller .",
    "consequently , an equilibrium cluster with a larger value of @xmath123 tends to make @xmath77 decreases faster with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that for @xmath113 ( @xmath103 ) , the temperature in models with non - zero @xmath123 decreases ( increases ) more rapidly than in the @xmath127 counterpart , although the difference between models with @xmath128 and 1.0 is negligible for small @xmath43 .",
    "note that even when @xmath105 , for which localized - heating models have declining temperature profiles , equilibrium temperature in distributed - heating models increases in the regions with @xmath129 and eventually converges to @xmath0 at @xmath130 .",
    "we see that distributed heating does not change the condition @xmath116 for the existence of rising temperature distributions .",
    "the distributed - heating models do not work better than the localized - heating model in terms of producing temperature distributions similar to observations ; it in fact aggravates the situation by making all of the gas in clusters nearly isothermal except only in the central @xmath131 kpc regions .",
    "another factor that may affect the equilibrium structure is the radial mass variation of cluster galaxies .",
    "although galaxies located near the central parts of clusters tend to have a large fraction of luminous matter , ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the strong tidal stripping of dark - matter halos is likely to cause the total ( luminous + dark ) masses of individual galaxies to be smaller toward the cluster center ( @xcite ; ekk04 ; @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by this consideration , we adopt several algebraic forms of @xmath132 that either monotonically decrease or increase by about a factor of 20 or less from the cluster center to @xmath133 , and then solve equation ( [ diff2 ] ) .",
    "the resulting temperature profiles are almost identical to those of the constant - mass cases presented in figure [ disth ] . because the distribution of galaxy masses appears logarithmically in equation ( [ diff2 ] ) , it does not considerably affect temperature structures , although it dramatically changes electron number - density profiles .",
    "we now discuss thermal stability of a system in which radiative cooling is locally balanced by df - mediated heating . for spatially localized heating , the net loss function @xmath134 is given by @xmath135 where the power index @xmath136 accounts for the local temperature dependence of @xmath77 in a piecewise manner , and the positive constants @xmath137 and @xmath59 contain all information on the cluster properties other than gas density and temperature .",
    "figure [ slope ] plots @xmath138 as a function of @xmath30 , which gives @xmath139 at around the transonic temperature ( @xmath140 ) , while @xmath141 for supersonic temperatures ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the curves asymptote to @xmath142 for @xmath143 and to @xmath144 for @xmath32 , as the asymptotic formulae given in  2 suggest .",
    "note that @xmath136 is insensitive to the choice of @xmath145 as long as @xmath146 .",
    "thermal stability of a system can be easily checked by using the generalized field criterion which states that the system is thermally unstable to isobaric perturbations if @xmath147 =   - p \\frac{\\alpha \\rho}{t^{3/2 } } < 0,\\ ] ] where the second equality assumes @xmath148 corresponding to thermal equilibrium @xcite . since @xmath149 for @xmath114 ( and @xmath150 for @xmath151 ) , this implies that the icm is thermally unstable ( stable ) if heating is caused preferentially by galaxies moving at a supersonic ( subsonic ) speed .",
    "dense inner parts of galaxy clusters , where the cooling time is less than the hubble time , are filled with low - temperature gas such that galaxy motions are readily supersonic , implying that df - induced heating is unable to quench thermal instability in those cooling cores .",
    "whether thermal instability has important dynamical consequences on cluster evolution can be judged by considering its growth time which amounts to @xmath152 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . even if cooling cores are thermally unstable , therefore , the virulence of thermal instability may or may not manifest itself during the lifetime of clusters depending on the value of @xmath136 .",
    "for example , for a cluster with @xmath99 and @xmath153 kev at the central regions , @xmath154 and @xmath155 from figure [ slope ] , giving @xmath156 gyr .",
    "this is almost comparable to the ages of clusters since the last major merger event ( @xmath157 gyr for massive clusters ; @xcite ) , suggesting that thermally instability may be dynamically unimportant for practical purposes .",
    "the inability of df - induced heating to suppress thermal instability seems not to be a fatal problem as long as the following two conditions are met : i ) cooling cores are in thermal equilibrium , a basic premise of the stability analysis ; and ii ) galaxies near the central parts move at near - transonic speeds ( @xmath158 ) , so as to have a sufficiently small value of @xmath136 .",
    "while the second condition appears to be easily satisfied in clusters , the results of the preceding section suggests that the first condition may not be so if df - induced heating is to balance radiative cooling for the _ whole _ range of radii . since the cooling time outside",
    "the cooling radius is longer than the hubble time , one may argue that material beyond the cooling radius does not need any heating source and that it is sufficient for df of galaxies to supply heat to gas only in cooling cores .",
    "we address this possibility in the next section .    as a final remark of this section",
    ", we compare our results with previous work .",
    "formally , equation ( [ gfield ] ) implies that gas subject to df - induced heating has a critical temperature above ( below ) which it becomes thermally stable ( unstable ) and that this critical temperature corresponds exactly to unity mach number of galaxy motions .",
    "this result is quite different from those of previous work which made some approximations on the heating function .",
    "for instance , @xcite argued that gas with drag heating is always thermally unstable and rapidly turns into a multi - phase medium , a consequence of his neglecting the temperature dependence of the heating function ( corresponding to @xmath159 in eq .",
    "[ [ call ] ] ) . although @xcite found a similar critical gas temperature , they considered only the supersonic regime and used an approximate heating function from the shock jump conditions , which makes their critical temperature smaller than ours by a factor of about three .",
    "our result , based on the general formula of @xcite for the drag force applicable for both supersonic and subsonic cases , represents the situation better .",
    "we have shown in the preceding sections that an equilibrium cluster subject to df - mediated heating has a temperature profile that either decreases ( for @xmath160 or @xmath161 ) or increases ( for @xmath116 ) with radius .",
    "while the radially increasing temperature profile is attractive , the requirement that thermal energy is balanced locally in the entire regions out to @xmath67 causes the central gas temperature to be no less than 0.6 times the virial temperature , about a factor two larger than observations . since",
    "radiative cooling is important only in the dense central parts inside the cooling radius , however , it would be sufficient for df of galaxies to provide heat only in such a cooling core instead of the entire regions .",
    "in addition , thermal instability would not be an issue provided that gas is in thermal equilibrium and that galaxy motions are near transonic (  5 ) .",
    "therefore , it may be possible for a cluster to start from an arbitrary non - equilibrium state and evolve slowly under both radiative cooling and df - mediated heating , ending up with an equilibrium core in which thermal instability has a very long growth time .",
    "the resulting temperature profile , albeit consistent with observations , need not represent an equilibrium for the whole range of radii .",
    "to test this idea , we have run a number of one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in spherical polar coordinates .",
    "we set up a logarithmically spaced radial grid , with 400 zones , from 1 kpc to 1 mpc , and explicitly implement the net cooling - heating function described by equation ( [ call ] ) .",
    "we also include the effect of gravitational potential due to _ passive _ dark matter using equation ( [ dphi_dr ] ) with @xmath162 and @xmath63 kpc ; the df - coupling between gas and the dark matter and back reaction on the latter component are not taken into account . as initial conditions , we consider spherically symmetric clusters and",
    "take @xmath163 with the central electron density @xmath164 , 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.02 @xmath165 , and fix @xmath166 kev independent of the radius for all models .",
    "we adopt @xmath63 kpc , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , and consider both localized heating and distributed heating with @xmath1670.1 and 1 .",
    "note that the corresponding equilibrium density profile has @xmath168 @xmath165 when heating is localized .",
    "we adopt the outflow boundary conditions for scalar variables ( i.e. , density , energy , etc . )",
    "that assign the same values in the ghost zones as in the corresponding active zones . for the radial velocity ,",
    "we allow it to vary as a linear function of radius at the inner boundary , while fixing it to be zero at the outer boundary ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using the zeus hydrodynamic code @xcite",
    ", we solve the basic hydrodynamic equations and follow the nonlinear evolution of each model cluster .",
    "the resulting radial profiles of electron number density and temperature of model a with @xmath169 and model b with @xmath170 , both of which assume spatially localized heating , are shown in figure [ evol ] for a few time epochs .",
    "model a , which initially has larger density than the equilibrium value everywhere , immediately develops radial mass inflows .",
    "as time evolves , the temperature drops and the density increases .",
    "compared to pure cooling cases which fairly well maintain near isobaric conditions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , df - induced heating is found to cause thermal pressure to increase with density as @xmath171 . since @xmath172 and @xmath173 with @xmath149 for supersonic galaxy motions , however , the system is thermally unstable and cooling occurs at a much faster rate as temperature decreases .",
    "model a experiences a cooling catastrophe in less than 4 gyr .",
    "on the other hand , model b with initial overheating becomes hotter and less dense , which in turn tends to increase the ratio of heating rate to the cooling rate for @xmath174 .",
    "as the gas temperature increases , the mach number of galaxy motions become smaller , reducing the value of @xmath136 .",
    "the cooling rate will therefore eventually exceed the heating rate and the cluster evolution will be reversed . in the case of model",
    "b , this turnaround will occur at @xmath175 gyr when @xmath176 kev ( or @xmath177 ) is reached .",
    "the evolution of models with different density and different length scales for heat distribution is qualitatively similar to those of models a and b , namely that clusters catastrophically evolve toward vanishing central temperature if cooling dominates initially , while clusters with initial excessive heating heat up steadily .",
    "this suggests that df - induced heating does not naturally lead non - equilibrium clusters to thermally stable , equilibrium cores . as shown in  3 and  4",
    ", df of galaxies does not explain the observed temperature distributions of clusters if the condition of thermal energy balance is imposed for all radii .",
    "although it is enough for df - induced heating to balance radiative cooling only in cooling cores , such cooling cores do not naturally form from non - equilibrium states .",
    "unless the properties and galaxies and icm are fine tuned , small departures from an equilibrium state rapidly evolve into an extreme configuration .",
    "therefore , we conclude that df - induced heating _ alone _ is not likely to account for the absence of cold gas in the centers of galaxy clusters .",
    "although heating by df from galaxies does not appear to provide a complete solution to the cooling flow problem , we see that the df - induced heating can still offset a considerable amount of radiative cooling .",
    "the isobaric cooling time is given by @xmath178 where @xmath179 represents the contribution of the df - induced heating .",
    "figure [ tscale ] plots as solid lines the cooling time as a function of @xmath40 for @xmath180 or as a function of @xmath181 with varying density .",
    "the cases without any heating are compared as dotted lines .",
    "the time epochs when clusters experience cooling catastrophe in the numerical simulations are marked in figure [ tscale]@xmath182 as solid circle , triangle , cross , and open circle for no heating , the distributed heating with @xmath183 and 0.1 , and the localized heating cases , respectively .",
    "the numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "models with distributed heating tend to have longer cooling time . when @xmath180 and @xmath184 , figure [ tscale]@xmath182 shows that df - induced heating lengthens the cooling time by about 13% compared to the pure cooling case .",
    "however , as figure [ tscale]@xmath185 indicates , the offset of cooling by df - induced heating is increasingly larger as @xmath186 increases .",
    "the increment of the cooling time could be as large as 140% when @xmath187 and @xmath188 , suggesting that thermal energy supplied by df of galaxies is by no means non - negligible .",
    "friction of galaxy motions via the gravitational interaction with their own gravitationally induced wake in the icm has often been invoked as an efficient heating mechanism of the gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; ekk04 ) .",
    "this idea of df - mediated heating of the icm is quite attractive because there is sufficient energy available in galaxy motions and the mechanism is self - regulating ; it operates effectively only when the temperature of gas is in a certain range , which happens to be the typical gas temperatures in the cooling cores of galaxy clusters . in this paper",
    ", we take one step further from @xcite and ekk04 to calculate equilibrium density and temperature profiles of the hot gas heated by df of galaxies . instead of restricting to cases where galaxy motions are all supersonic",
    ", we use the general formula derived by @xcite for the drag force that takes allowance for both supersonic and subsonic galaxy motions in a gaseous medium .",
    "we show that the total heating rate due to the df of galaxies in a typical rich cluster is comparable to its total x - ray luminosity , confirming the results of @xcite and ekk04 ( see  2 ) .",
    "next , we derive the local heating function ( eq .  [ [ edot ] ] ) assuming that the orbits of galaxies are isotropic and isothermal under the nfw distribution of dark matter and that the kinetic energy lost by a galaxy is deposited into heat at the location of the galaxy .",
    "the condition that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium and maintains energy balance requires the temperature profile to be one of the following three kinds : isothermal , with @xmath110 ; a decreasing profile with radius when @xmath161 or @xmath160 ; an increasing profile when @xmath116 , where @xmath0 and @xmath189 denote the temperatures corresponding to unity mach number of galaxy motions with respect to the isothermal and adiabatic sound speeds , respectively ( eqs .",
    "[ [ tsol ] ] and [ [ tsonic ] ] ) .",
    "the isothermal solution is interesting because it quite well describes the observed scaling relationship among clusters properties .",
    "although the rising temperature solution is attractive since clusters usually show a temperatures drop at the central regions , it strictly requires the central temperature to be no lower than 0.6 times the virial temperature , which is roughly twice smaller than the observed values (  3 ) .",
    "we also consider cases in which df - induced heating is distributed in space according to a gaussian form , and/or the masses of cluster galaxies vary over radius , and find that the stringent limit of @xmath190 for rising temperature distributions remains unchanged (  4 ) .",
    "using the local heating function we have derived , we analyze thermal stability of the gas subject to radiative cooling and df - mediated heating (  5 ) .",
    "when galaxy motions are subsonic , the heating rate that deceases steeply with temperature suppresses thermal instability completely . on the other hand , supersonic galaxy motions for which the heating rate is relatively insensitive to temperature are unable to stop the growth of thermal instability",
    "the growth time in the presence of df - induced heating is at least twice that in the pure cooling case , and becomes progressively longer as the mach number of galaxies decreases .",
    "when galaxies move at slightly supersonic velocities with mach number less than 2 , which is very likely at cluster centers , the growth time becomes comparable to the ages of clusters .",
    "this implies that thermal instability , even if operates , may have insignificant dynamical consequences on cluster evolution .    noting that regions outside the cooling radius need not be in strict thermal equilibrium , we look for a possibility using numerical hydrodynamic simulations that clusters evolve from an arbitrary non - equilibrium state and form current cooling cores in which df - induced heating balances radiative cooling (  6 ) .",
    "we find that clusters that were initially dominated by cooling unavoidably develop radial mass inflows and decreases their central temperatures in a runaway fashion , whereas clusters with initial overheating slowly heat up and result in radially decreasing temperature profiles .",
    "equilibrium solutions therefore do not appear to form an attracting set for galaxy and gas configurations , suggesting that when df from galaxies is the sole heating source , it is extremely difficult to obtain equilibrium cores by smoothly evolving non - equilibrium clusters ( even if in some cases the cooling catastrophe can be deferred so as to occur on a longer timescale ) .",
    "putting together all the results of this paper we conclude that df of galaxies _ alone _ , albeit an interesting heating mechanism with a lot of available energy , can not be the lone heating agency to balance radiative cooling in rich galaxy clusters .",
    "we nonetheless note that the heating due df of galaxies could considerably lengthen the cooling time , depending on the value of @xmath191 , and thus should not be neglected in energetics of galaxy clusters .",
    "one of the key assumptions made in this paper is that all the kinetic energy lost by galaxies via df is transferred to the thermal energy of the surrounding gas .",
    "the rationale behind this assumption is that the superposition of the wakes produces turbulence in the icm and the kinetic energy injected into the icm turbulence at saturation cascades down along the kolmogorov - like energy spectrum , and eventually transforms into heat through viscous dissipation at small scales .",
    "another possibility is that a large fraction of the kinetic energy of galaxies is used to merely enhance the level of the turbulence instead of being converted into heat .",
    "this may occur when the turbulence is not fully developed yet .",
    "the characteristics of the icm turbulence is not well known , yet observations and numerical simulations suggest an average velocity dispersion @xmath192 on scales of @xmath193 kpc @xcite .",
    "the associated turbulent kinetic energy is @xmath194 erg for the total mass @xmath195 of the icm in a rich cluster .",
    "let us assume that this energy is supplied solely by df of galaxies at a rate given by equation ( [ num ] ) .",
    "if the level of turbulence keeps increasing without dissipation , it would take about 7 gyr for the df of galaxies to feed the icm turbulence to the observed level , which is almost comparable to the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "conversely , if the turbulence is fully developed and in a steady state such that the energy injection rate by df is equal to the rate of dissipation , it would have @xmath196 for @xmath197 kpc , which is too small to explain the observations .",
    "all of these imply that the contribution from the df of galaxies to the icm turbulence is not considerable ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if the dissipation of the ( fully developed ) turbulence is to provide enough heat to balance radiative cooling , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , the energy injection should not be entirely due to the df of galaxies ; it requires other energy sources , including jets from active galactic nuclei and mergers with smaller groups or clusters .",
    "the assertion that the conversion of galaxy kinetic energy into thermal energy of the gas may not be so effective is supported by the results of @xcite who studied using numerical simulations cluster formation in @xmath198cdm cosmology , with the df of galaxies included explicitly .",
    "they found that ( 1 ) the motions of galaxies at the present epoch are slightly supersonic , with an average mach number of @xmath199 ; ( 2 ) gas within the virial radius has a velocity dispersion @xmath200 resulting probably from infall motions of galaxies and small groups , with small contribution from the df of galaxies ; and ( 3 ) the clusters still suffer from the cooling catastrophe . although higher - resolution , more - controlled simulations are required to make a definitive statement , the last point of their results suggests that the system is thermally unstable or heating by df may be quite inefficient  for , as we have seen in the previous section , systems evolved from arbitrary initial conditions do not generally tend to the equilibrium solutions , which do not therefore form an attracting set ; and for some initial parameters the delay in the cooling catastrophe that the df mechanism leads to is not significant .",
    "we finally note that several issues of potential importance were not investigated in this paper .",
    "one of these relates to the galaxy velocity anisotropy .",
    "it is easy to show that , for isothermal distribution with constant anisotropy , it is possible to obtain equilibrium solutions with smaller central gas temperatures , more in line with observations .",
    "however these tend to have unrealistic galaxy number density distributions .",
    "the equilibrium and stability of gas configurations in more realistic anisotropic models have not been investigated .",
    "we have adopted the general formula of @xcite for the drag force on a galaxy moving at an arbitrary speed .",
    "this is an improvement over previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; ekk04 ) that considered only supersonic galaxy motions . while its explicit dependence on the mach number enabled us to explore temperature profiles of equilibrium clusters , the formula still assumes a galaxy moving in a _ straight - line _ orbit through a _ uniform _ gaseous medium . clearly , the icm is radially stratified and galaxies follow curved rather than rectilinear trajectories . in a collisionless system ,",
    "@xcite recently showed that the density inhomogeneity reduces the coulomb logarithm of the chandrasekhar formula by limiting the the maximum impact parameter to the local scale length of density variation ( see also @xcite ) , and induces an additional drag force in the lateral direction of the galaxy motion ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they further showed that the reduction of the coulomb logarithm makes the orbital energy loss 15% less effective , inhibiting the circularization of the orbit , while the additional tangential drag force has a negligible effect on the orbital evolution .",
    "similar effects are expected to occur in a gaseous medium , yet their consequences are not known quantitatively .",
    "a related important question is how heat ( or turbulent ) energy is distributed in the wakes that form in the turbulent , inhomogeneous , magnetized icm .",
    "a real assessment of the effects of df to dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters requires answers to the above questions , which will direct our future research .",
