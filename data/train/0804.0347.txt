    "the main goal of the araucaria project is to improve the calibration of the cosmic distance scale from accurate observations of the various primary stellar distance indicators in nearby galaxies ( e.g. gieren et al .",
    "in particular , we are significantly improving the distance measurements to the araucaria target galaxies using ir photometry , which minimizes both the influence of interstellar extinction , and of metallicity and/or age on the brightness of stellar distance indicators .",
    "indeed , in our previous papers we have demonstrated that the red clump stars ( pietrzynski and gieren 2002 ; pietrzynski , gieren and udalski 2003 ) , and cepheid variable stars ( e.g. pietrzynski et al .",
    "2006 ; gieren et al .",
    "2005a , 2006 , 2008 ; soszynski et al .",
    "2006 ) are outstanding distance indicators in the near - infrared domain .",
    "thanks to several recent and important theoretical and empirical studies of rr lyrae stars we have now good reasons to believe that rr lyrae stars are also capable of providing much improved distances from their magnitudes in the near - infrared regime , as compared to the traditional optical studies .",
    "longmore et al .",
    "( 1986 ) were the first to show that rr lyrae stars follow a period - luminosity ( pl ) relation in the k band",
    ". then important contributions were added by carney et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , nemec et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , jones et al .",
    "( 1993 ) frolov and samus ( 1998 ) and bono et al .",
    "dallora et al .",
    "( 2004 ) later demonstrated that such a relation could be very tight for rr lyrae stars in a globular cluster , with its very low metallicity spread .",
    "detailed theoretical studies of the rr lyrae period - mean magnitude - metallicity relations in different near - infrared passbands were done by bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and catelan et al .",
    "sollima et al . ( 2006 ) analyzed near - infrared k - band data of rr lyrae stars for some 15 galactic globular clusters and provided the first extensive empirical calibration of the period - luminosity - metallicity ( plz ) relation in the k band .",
    "most recently , the zero point of this relation was improved based on accurate near - infrared observations of the rr lyrae star ( sollima et al .",
    "these existing theoretical and empirical results have demonstrated that a near - infrared plz relation for rr lyrae stars appears to be a very accurate means for distance determination to galaxies containing an abundant old stellar population .",
    "we are therefore including this tool in our project and expect that we will be able to improve on its current calibration by conducting near - infrared observations of large numbers of rr lyrae variables in a number of nearby galaxies , and comparing the resulting rr lyrae distances to those emerging from other methods , like the trgb technique .    with its rich population of both rrab and rrc stars which span a wide range of metallicities ( clementini et al .",
    "2005 ) , the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy is an ideal laboratory for studying the infrared plz relations defined by these variables .",
    "therefore we included this galaxy in the target list of the araucaria project . in this paper , we present first results from deep single - phase near - infrared imaging of 78 rr lyrae stars in sculptor .",
    "we will show that these data allow a distance determination for sculptor with very small intrinsic error .",
    "the near infrared data presented in this paper were collected as a part of the araucaria project , with the eso ntt telescope on la silla equipped with the sofi infrered camera ( moorwood , a. , cuby , j.g . ,",
    "lindman , c. , 1998 ) . the large field setup , with a field of view of 4.9 x 4.9 arcmin , and a scale of 0.288 arcsec / pixel was used .",
    "during one photometric night we observed two fields in sculptor , which contain a large number of rr lyrae stars .",
    "their locations are shown in fig .",
    "1 . we secured single deep j and ks observations for each field under excellent ( 0.6 \" ) seeing conditions . in order to account for rapid sky level variations in the infrared domain ,",
    "our observations were performed with a dithering technique .",
    "the resulting total integration times were 44 and 21 minutes for ks and j band images , respectively .",
    "all reductions and calibrations were performed with a pipeline developed and used in the course of the araucaria project .",
    "briefly , the sky subtraction was applied in two - step process implying masking of stars with the xdimsum iraf package ( see pietrzyski and gieren ( 2002 ) for more details ) .",
    "then the single images were flat - fielded and stacked into the final , deep images .",
    "psf photometry and aperture corrections were derived using daophot and allstar programs , in an identical manner as described in pietrzyski , gieren , and udalski ( 2002 ) .    in order to calibrate our photometry to the standard system 9 standard stars from the ukirt list ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) were observed under photometric conditions at different airmasses together with our target fields .",
    "the chosen standards have colors which bracket the colors of the rr lyrae stars in sculptor . given the large number of standard stars the accuracy of the zero point of our photometry",
    "was estimated to be about 0.02 mag .    in order to make an external check of our photometry",
    "the magnitudes of the bright stars in our fields were transformed onto the 2mass photometric system and then compared with the 2mass photometry .",
    "we found the following differences ( in the sense 2mass photometry minus our results ) : -0.01 @xmath0 0.11 mag ( k ) , -0.03 @xmath0 0.13 mag ( j ) .",
    "the j and k band magnitudes of the observed rr lyrae stars , together with the corresponding errors as returned by daophot , and the time of the beginning of each exposure are given in table 1 .",
    "since the ir light curves of rr lyrae stars are nearly sinusoidal and have relatively small amplitudes ( e.g. del principe et al . 2006 ) , single - phase measurements of j and k magnitudes of rr lyrae stars give approximations of reasonable accuracy to their mean magnitudes in these bands . the pl relations in j and k we obtain from our random single - phase data are presented in fig .",
    "2 . two sequences are clearly visible , corresponding to the first overtone ( rrc ) and fundamental mode ( rrab ) pulsators , respectively .",
    "the relatively large scatter observed in this figure is caused by the three following factors : firstly , a single phase ir measurement is expected to approximate the mean magnitude of a rr lyrae variable to about 0.15 mag only .",
    "secondly , a rather large spread of metallicities is observed for the rr lyrae stars of this galaxy ( clementini et al .",
    "2005 , kaluzny et al .",
    "clementini et al ( 2005 ) determined a mean metallicity ( on the zinn and west scale ) of rr lyrae stars of -1.83 @xmath0 0.26 dex . assuming a metallicity dependence in the k and j bands of 0.175 and 0.190 mag / dex , respectively ( catelan et al . 2004 )",
    ", we expect an additional scatter in the ir magnitudes of fig . 2 of about 0.05 mag ( one @xmath1 ) due to the metallicity inhomogeneity of our sample of rr lyrae stars in sculptor .",
    "finally , the accuracy of our individual magnitudes is between 0.04 and 0.07 mag for stars having k band magnitudes in the range from 18.6 to 19.5 . clearly , the largest source for the scatter in fig .",
    "2 is the replacement of mean magnitudes derived from complete light curves by the single - phase observations .",
    "unfortunatelly due to a very large gap between the optical survey by kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and our ir observations it is not possible to use the template light curves provided by jones et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to calculate more accurate mean magnitudes .",
    "the slopes of the pl relations followed by the rrab and rrc stars , and by the whole , combined rrab+rrc sample of rr lyrae stars as obtained from free least - square fits to a line in both j and k band filters are given in table 2 . in order to merge the first overtone and fundamental pulsators",
    ", a value of 0.127 was added to the logarithm of the periods of the rrc stars , following dallora et al .",
    "unfortunately , the relatively large errors associated with these slope determinations do not allow us to conduct a detailed discussion on these results .",
    "we can only conclude that within the limited accuracy we can achieve in this study we can not detect any significant difference between the slopes of the k- and j - band pl relations obtained for the rrc and rrab stars , respectively .",
    "the slopes agree furthermore very well with both , the existing theoretical ( bono et al .",
    "2003 , catelan et al .",
    "2004 ) and empirical ( sollima et al . 2008 ) slope results obtained for field rr lyrae stars .",
    "in order to derive the apparent distance moduli to the sculptor galaxy from our data , we used the following calibrations of the near - infrared pl relations of mixed population rr lyrae stars : + @xmath2 = -1.07 @xmath3 2.38 log p + 0.08 [ fe / h ] ; sollima et al ( 2008 ) ( 1 ) + @xmath2 = -0.77 @xmath3 2.101 logp + 0.231 [ fe / h ] ; bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( 2 ) + @xmath2 = -0.597 @xmath3 2.353 logp + 0.175 logz ; catelan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( 3 ) + @xmath4 = -0.141 @xmath3 1.773 logp + 0.190 logz ; catelan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( 4 ) + we recall that the calibration of sollima et al .",
    "( 2008 ) was constructed for the 2mass photometric system , while the calibrations of bono et al . and catelan et al .",
    "are valid for the bessel and brett and glass systems .",
    "therefore , we transformed our own data , calibrated onto the ukirt system ( hawarden et al .",
    "2001 ) , to the bessel and brett and glass systems using the transformations given by carpenter ( 2001 ) , before calculating distances using the calibrations of bono et al . and catelan et al .",
    ", respectively .",
    "since there is virtually no difference between the k - band filters of 2mass and ukirt ( carpenter 2001 ) , we did not apply any transformations to our data for the sollima et al .",
    "calibrations .    assuming the mean metallicity of our rr lyrae sample to be -1.83 @xmath0 0.26 dex ( clementini et al . 2005 ) , we calculated the k- and j- band apparent distance moduli as tabulated in table 3 .",
    "the corresponding fits to a straight line are presented in figure 3 .",
    "the calculations were made for the rrab star sample alone , and for the combined sample of rrab and rrc stars , after adding 0.127 in logarithm of period to the rrc stars .",
    "the results obtained for both samples are in an excellent agreement ( within 0.5 @xmath1 ) , so hereinafter we decided to adopt the slightly more accurate results from the whole sample of rr lyrae stars observed in this galaxy ( e.g. rrab and rrc ) for further discussion .    to correct the obtained apparent distance moduli for interstellar reddening , we adopted a foreground reddening of e(b - v ) = 0.018 mag which is calculated toward the sculptor galaxy from the galactic exctinction maps of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . assuming the reddening law from this same paper we obtain the following values for the selective extinctions in the different bands : @xmath5=0.007 mag , @xmath6=0.017 mag , @xmath7=0.059 mag .",
    "the resulting true distance moduli for sculptor are summarized in table 4 .",
    "we also include the true distance modulus to the sculptor galaxy from the optical v band data of kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in this table .",
    "the results in table 4 demonstrate that the true distance moduli obtained from the theoretical calibrations of the rr lyrae plz relation in the j and k bands of catelan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are practically identical .",
    "they also agree very well with the results obtained from the empirical calibration of sandage ( 1993 ) for the v band , and the v - band data of kaluzny et al .",
    "this hints at a very small internal reddening produced inside the sculptor galaxy .",
    "the distance modululi obtained from the independent theoretical calibration of catelan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and bono et al.(2003 ) and empirical calibration of sollima et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the k band , are different by some 0.05 mag .",
    "such a difference is not significant taking into account all uncertainties involved in those calibrations .",
    "there are several sources of systematic error in our procedure of distance determinations .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties of the coefficients of the adopted calibrations , on the one hand ; assuming an error of the adopted mean metallicity of our rr lyrae sample of 0.26 dex as given by clementini et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; assuming an accuracy of the photometric zero points of 0.02 mag ; and finally , taking into account an uncertainty of 0.01 mag associated to the absorption correction , we estimate the systematic errors on each of the distance determinations as listed in table 4 .",
    "they are significantly larger than the corresponding statistical errors and are dominated by the errors associated with the uncertainty of the assumed ( constant ) metallicity of the individual rr lyrae stars in our sample .",
    "we adopt from our study 19.67 @xmath0 0.02 ( statistical ) @xmath0 0.12 ( systematic ) mag ( e.g. the mean value ) as the true distance modulus of the sculptor dsph galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , there is very little information about the distance to sculptor galaxy in the literature .",
    "our adopted distance agrees very well with the results obtained by rizzi ( 2002 ) from the optical photometry of the trgb ( 19.64 @xmath0 0.08 mag ) and hb ( 19.66 @xmath0 0.15 mag ) .",
    "our results also indicate that the systematic errors of the different empirical and theoretical calibrations in the literature were probably estimated quite conservatively and may in fact be smaller",
    ". we will be able to check on this more closely once we can compare the present results from ir photometry of rr lyrae variables with distance results from other techniques .",
    "29 rr lyrae stars from our sample are in common with the list of rr lyrae stars with metallicity determinations reported by clementini et al .",
    "this provides an opportunity to calculate distances to individual stars based on equations ( 1 - 4 ) and then compare the results with the values obtained from fitting of the plk relations and assuming a mean metallicity of -1.83 dex .",
    "the following values calculated as the mean from the 29 individual true distance moduli were obtained : 19.60 @xmath0 0.05 ( sollima et al . , k band ) , 19.69 @xmath0 0.05 ( bono et al , k band ) , 19.66 @xmath0 0.04 ( catelan et al . , k band ) , and 19.68 @xmath0 0.06 ( catelan et al . , j band ) . as can be seen",
    "these moduli are fully consistent with the values listed in the table 4 .",
    "we have determined the distance to the local group sculptor dwarf galaxy from single - phase near - infrared observations in j and k of 78 rr lyrae stars .",
    "different calibrations of the near - infrared plz relation for rr lyrae stars yield closely consistent distance results which also agree with the distance modulus derived from optical v - band data .",
    "while our data are very well suited for a precise distance determination to this galaxy , it will be necessary to secure additional data to study in detail the slope of the plz relation in j and k , and to perform a high - precision empirical determination of the metallicity dependence of the relation .",
