    "a starting point for these theoretical efforts is a reasonable band structure for fese .",

    "we also calculated the spin fluctuation exchange pairing interaction , and showed that it yielded a superconducting ground state with gap structure consistent with stm and penetration depth measurements.@xcite    recently , the first inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) results on this system became available@xcite , showing the dominance of `` conventional '' @xmath2 spin fluctuations at low energies and persisting up to @xmath14 , while previous _ ab initio _ approaches did not find low - energy excitations at that momentum@xcite . for @xmath5",
    "greater than @xmath14 , both ins and nmr experiments have suggested that no significant low - energy spin fluctuation weight was present , in contrast to pnictide systems such as bafe@xmath15as@xmath15 , where such strong magnetic fluctuations were tied to the nematic transition@xcite .",
    "understanding the cause for suppression of @xmath2 spin fluctuations seen in neutron scattering and nmr at high @xmath5 is clearly important to understand the physical reasons for the suppression of magnetic order in these systems , and the relation , if any , between spin fluctuations , nematic order and orbital order .",
    "several novel proposals have been made recently about how unusual magnetic effects might prevent the occurrence of long range magnetic order@xcite or lead to a type of order that is difficult to observe@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 spin fluctuations in fese have a broad maximum , according to ins , at very low energy , of order @xmath16 , which acquires significant amplitude immediately below @xmath14@xcite .",

    "one proposal to reconcile the results of these two probes is the presence of an apparent spin gap in the ins measurements below about 2 mev ; there is no apparent explanation for such a spin gap , however .",
    "another possibility is that the spin fluctuations remain at intermediate @xmath5 and nmr spin relaxation is less sensitive to them in this material due to the presence of competing fluctuations that evolve differently with the evolution of @xmath5-dependent band structure .",

    "we reproduce the low - energy @xmath2 spin fluctuations and the neutron resonance in the superconducting state , but show that at higher energies the spin fluctuations disperse to wave vectors along the @xmath20 line in momentum space .",
    "we continue to find a @xmath5-dependence of the knight shift and @xmath13 in agreement with experiment , despite the fact that our model does not have a low - energy normal state spin gap .",
    "we attribute the apparent insensitivity of the nmr to the @xmath2 fluctuations at high @xmath5 to the weak overall weight at this wave vector , due to the electronic structure of this material .",
    "the superconducting order parameter derived from spin - fluctuation pairing has @xmath21 character with accidental nodes , leading to a v - shaped density of states ( dos ) at the fermi surface .",

    "these predictions can be checked experimentally in a single - domain sample .",
    "the overall picture that emerges for this material is a system driven to the verge of a magnetic instability by orbital ordering .",

    "a band structure that is consistent with the observed electronic structure in fese has been provided in ref .  , where it was shown that the rather complex renormalizations of band structure relative to dft observed in fe - based superconducting systems@xcite , involving both fermi velocity changes and relative shifts of hole and electron bands , could be captured in terms of relatively simple modifications of a few short - range matrix elements ( details can be found in appendix a ) .",

    "this combination of orbital ordering is motivated by a recent arpes measurement on detwinned fese@xcite , showing that the band splitting between the @xmath0 bands occurs in opposite directions at the @xmath41 and m points .",

    "[ fig : staticchi ] shows the bare and rpa spin susceptibilities @xmath48 and @xmath45 as a function of momentum .",

    "this is reminiscent of the scenario of glasbrenner _",

    "[ fig : staticchi ] , singling out the @xmath2 fluctuations as the dominant ones .",
    "this remains true also with the susceptibility enhanced by interactions in the rpa scheme ; spectral weight is moved downwards in energy near @xmath2 to dominate the spin spectrum up to @xmath52 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : highneut ] . from the fermi surface plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandfscut ] in appendix a it can be inferred that there is no obvious nesting at the fermi surface that can readily explain the larger noninteracting susceptibility at @xmath2 compared to @xmath53 .",

    "[ fig : highneut ] we also find similar @xmath2 fluctuations extending up to @xmath57 when the interactions are tuned close to the stoner instability ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the band renormalization factor ) such that there is no magnetic instability at least down to the temperature of the superconducting transition .",
    "note that at these high energies , the @xmath2 excitations are present both below and above the structural transition , as in experiment@xcite .",
    "we will come back to differences in weights of the stripe fluctuations close to @xmath2 and nel fluctuations close to @xmath3 as a function of @xmath5 later . additionally , the imaginary part of the susceptibility disperses and becomes more intense along the line from @xmath2 to @xmath3 as we move to higher energies .",
    "furthermore , there are weaker incommensurate branches which soften near @xmath3 , in contrast to observed spin excitations in fe pnictides@xcite .",

    "note that the increase in @xmath64 at low @xmath5 with decreasing @xmath65 is due to the low - energy peak in @xmath64 since the system is close to the magnetic instability .",
    "this unusual @xmath5 dependence is primarily due to an enhancement of low - energy spin fluctuations induced by the orbital ordering . by introducing correlations that push the system close to the magnetic instability",
    ", the low-@xmath5 fluctuations are amplified more strongly compared to high @xmath5 .",
    "we argue therefore that the suppression of the high-@xmath5 spin fluctuations seen in nmr experiments is not necessarily due to the presence of a spin gap , but may arise simply due to @xmath5-dependent electronic structure effects .",
    "for example , we note that while the @xmath2 fluctuations strengthen at low @xmath5 , those near @xmath3 lose spectral weight .",
    "since both such fluctuations contribute to the nmr spin relaxation , they evidently compensate each other to some extent , leaving a flatter @xmath5 dependence in the intermediate-@xmath5 region ; thus @xmath13 does not rise until close to @xmath7 when the @xmath2 fluctuations completely dominate , as discussed in appendix b.     at @xmath62 for the same interaction parameters as in fig .",

    "this has the principal virtue of confirming that the main physical phenomenon driving the subtle evolution of the electronic excitations is orbital ordering .",
    "we have proposed that both site - centered and bond - centered orbital order of similar order of magnitude are required to explain the existing experimental data . in the superconducting state , we find an order parameter with accidental nodes leading to a v - shaped dos and an anisotropy in the penetration depth as well as an enhanced magnetic response at momentum transfer @xmath2 .",
