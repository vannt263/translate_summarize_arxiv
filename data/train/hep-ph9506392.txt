    "the standard model of electro - weak ( qfd ) and strong ( qcd ) interactions is remarkably successfull .",
    "its perturbative formulation ( `` feynman diagrammatics '' ) appears to be theoretically consistent and agrees with present experiments .",
    "nevertheless , even for small couplings , there exist processes that can not be described by conventional perturbation theory and , notably , violate the classical conservation laws of certain fermionic quantum numbers  @xcite ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "[ bht ]    such anomalous processes are induced by _",
    "instantons _  @xcite which represent tunnelling processes in yang - mills gauge theories , associated with the highly degenerate vacuum structure .    for many years",
    ", such tunnelling transitions have been considered largely of academic interest , due to their exponential suppression @xmath1 at low energies .",
    "a few years ago , however , much activity in this field was generated by the observation  @xcite that instanton - induced processes may well become unsuppressed , i.e. observable , _ at high energies_.    the basic significance and possible importance of qcd - instanton effects in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) for decreasing bjorken variable @xmath2 and high photon virtuality @xmath3 has recently been emphasized  @xcite :    * first of all , qcd - instanton effects for decreasing @xmath2 are largely analogous  @xcite to the manifestation of electro - weak instantons at increasing energies .",
    "the anomalous @xmath4 violation due to electro - weak instantons is paralleled by a chirality violation induced by qcd - instantons  @xcite ( c.f .",
    "fig.1 ) . *",
    "secondly , discovery of qcd - instanton induced dis - events would itself be of basic significance , since they correspond to a novel , non - perturbative manifestation of qcd .    whereas a promising search for anomalous electro - weak events is only possible in the far future , presumably at a post - lhc collider  @xcite or at cosmic ray facilities  @xcite , the search for anomalous events induced by qcd - instantons can start right now , in deep inelastic @xmath5 scattering at hera .    [ hbt ]    naturally",
    ", the first observables where manifestations of qcd - instantons may be looked for are the nucleon structure functions .    within the theoretical framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , we have performed  @xcite a state of the art evaluation of the instanton - induced contribution to @xmath6 ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "it rises strongly with decreasing @xmath2 and tends to reach the size of the experimental data around @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , due to inherent uncertainties , the calculation can not be trusted anymore for @xmath8 , say .",
    "nevertheless , the trend is very suggestive !",
    "there are a number of reasons  @xcite that favour experimental searches for instanton - induced `` footprints '' in the multi - particle final state over searches via the structure functions , the latter being the most inclusive observables in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "it is the purpose of this contribution to present a brief status report on our phenomenological analysis of the instanton induced final state .",
    "the instanton - induced contribution to the multi - particle final state in dis arises in form of an instanton - induced subprocess ( denoted by `` @xmath9 '' in fig.3 ) along with a current - quark jet .",
    "the relevant kinematical variables are summarized in table  1 .",

    "* strong peaking of the @xmath9-subprocess total cross section  @xcite for decreasing bjorken variables @xmath17 : @xmath18 the importance of instanton - induced events at small @xmath19 crucially relies on the precise functional dependence of the `` holy grail '' function @xmath20 ( c.f .",

    "the qualitative event structure is expected to consist of a current - quark jet along with a densely populated hadronic `` band '' in the @xmath23-plane  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic band directly reflects the isotropy in the @xmath9-rest system along with a large multiplicity of semi - hard quarks and gluons .      a monte carlo simulation for instanton - induced events at hera",

    "it includes full hadronization . while it should already account for the composition of the final state quite well",
    ", we do not yet quote absolute production rates , since a _",
    "reliable _ theoretical estimate of the cross sections , in particular at smaller values of @xmath19 and @xmath24 , is quite difficult and still in progress  @xcite .",
    "the main questions addressed so far , concern the typical event - structure , and transverse energy as well as muon and @xmath0 flows and some characteristic event distributions .",

    "furthermore , we impose a cut on the total invariant mass in the @xmath9-subprocess , @xmath27 gev , in order to guarantee a minimum virtuality @xmath28 gev@xmath29 .    in fig.5",
    "a typical instanton - induced event is displayed . the current - quark jet ( around @xmath30 ) along with the expected , densely populated hadronic `` band '' , centered around @xmath31 , are apparent .",
    "the electron is shown here as well .    in fig.6 ,",
    "the transverse energy flow versus @xmath32 is displayed .",
    "it exhibits a strong enhancement across the hadronic `` band '' , since each of the many hadrons from the @xmath9-subprocess contributes a comparable energy into a single @xmath32 bin of width @xmath33 .",
    "a related important quantity is the distribution of the transverse energy for hadrons within the `` band '' ( fig.7 ) .",
    "it peaks around @xmath34 gev , i.e. at a value much larger than the one from present experimental data .",
    "the @xmath0 and muon flows , displayed in figs.8 and 9 , again peak at the center of the band of hadrons emerging from the @xmath9-subprocess .",
    "this is presumably a distinctive signature for instanton induced events .",
    "it directly reflects the basic fact that in _ each _ such event a pair of strange and of charmed quarks is produced ( c.f .",

    "clearly , hera offers a unique window in dis !",
    "a discovery of such events would be of basic importance : first of all , as a novel , non - perturbative manifestation of qcd and secondly , because of the close analogy to anomalous @xmath4 violation in electro - weak processes in the multi - tev regime .",
