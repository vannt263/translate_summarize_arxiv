    "experimental techniques in the fields of mesoscopics and ultracold atoms have advanced to the point where it is feasible to explore the physics of few - boson and few - fermion systems , in particular in lattice systems which have traditionally been the basis for many - particle physics studies .",
    "the study of a few quantum particles in lattice situations provides surprises and unexpected phenomena quite distinct from issues in bulk condensed matter physics , whose focus is on _ many_-particle ground states , and from atomic or optical physics , where lattice systems are not very common .",
    "for example , a recent experiment has explored repulsive binding of boson pairs in a one - dimensional optical lattice @xcite .",
    "this is therefore the appropriate time to investigate further intricate and non - intuitive phenomena involving a few quantum particles in lattice systems . in this article",
    ", we consider interacting bosons or fermions in one - dimensional finite lattices , and present studies of _ localization _ at the lattice edge .",
    "we characterize the edge - localized states , and distinguish them from bound non - localized states , through analyses of the energy spectrum and band structure , density profiles of eigenstates , and dynamics .    for bosons ,",
    "we use the well - known bose - hubbard model @xcite , which has attracted a great deal of attention in the last decade due to its relevance to describing laser - cooled bosonic atoms subjected to an optical - lattice potential @xcite .",
    "localization in the bose - hubbard model is of particular interest because its large - boson limit can for many purposes be approximated by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation , which displays a host of localization phenomena .",
    "nonlinearity allows time - periodic and spatially - localized solutions of the dnls ( and other lattice nonlinear differential equations ) known as _ intrinsic localized modes _ or _ discrete breathers _",
    "more relevant to the present work , the dnls on finite lattices also possesses edge - localized modes , sometimes called discrete surface solitons @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that the large - boson limit of the open - boundary bose - hubbard model will possess eigenstates in which the bosons are localized at the edge . in this article",
    ", we pose the edge - localization question in the extreme opposite limit of a _ few _ quantum particles , where the mean - field approximation ( dnls equation ) can not _ a priori _ be expected to provide the correct intuition .",
    "the answer turns out to be subtle  this phenomenon is not present for the case of two particles , but appears when the particle number is three or more , as follows from numerical studies in ref .",
    "@xcite .    remarkably , we find that the phenomenon is not restricted to bosons , but also happens in other quantum lattice models .",
    "for example , the spinless fermion model with nearest - neighbor interactions , sometimes known as the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , has similar behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ , it possesses no edge states with two fermions , but does have such localized eigenstates with three fermions .",
    "since this model does not allow multiple occupancies , localization in this case refers to a sequence of neighboring sites being occupied , rather than all the particles clustered in one site as in the case of bosons .",
    "although the current work will focus on the two models mentioned above , our finding indicates that edge - localization may well be a generic phenomenon in quantum finite lattice systems .",
    "localization in quantum models generally does not appear in simple hamiltonians , but instead requires disorder @xcite or impurities breaking the translation invariance .",
    "( this is in contrast to lattice differential equations , _",
    "e.g. _ , the dnls equation , where the interplay of nonlinearity and spatial discreteness is sufficient to create localization . ) it is therefore of significant theoretical interest to explore the simple mechanism for quantum localization that is studied here , requiring only open boundary conditions in an interacting lattice hamiltonian .",
    "we also note that localization due to impurities / disorder is generally a single - particle effect , while the mechanism we present is a _ collective _ phenomenon since it requires at least three particles .",
    "while we focus on small numbers of bosons or fermions , the basic message is that edge states exist for any number of particles larger than two .",
    "we give an explanation based on perturbation theory .",
    "we also provide some hints toward the many - particle situation , by showing that the four - boson case has an additional type of edge - localized eigenstate in addition to the obvious generalization .",

    "in the three - boson or three - fermion case , only the breather band splits at higher than second order , while the other two bands have degeneracy lifting at linear order .",
    "( the linear splitting is manifested in the shapes of the non - breather bands in figures [ fig_bh - spectra]-d and [ fig_spectrumspinlessferm]-d . ) therefore in the three - particle systems only the breather band can have a subband ; this subband turns out to have two members which are edge states .    to rephrase , edge localization from the breather band",
    "can be seen as a result of the competition between ( a ) the distinct energy shifts @xmath106 recieved by the edge states , and ( b ) the degeneracy splitting for which the energy scale is @xmath107 , for an @xmath16-boson system . for @xmath78 , analogous energy scale competitions can also play a role in other ( multi - breather ) bands where splitting occurs at larger order , leading to subbands and more complicated edge states .",
    "we have illustrated this for @xmath79 , in section [ sec_4bosons ] .",
    "finally , we note that the two edge states separating out from the breather band are themselves very nearly degenerate at strong interactions .",
    "this degeneracy gets broken only at much higher order ; the relevant energy scale is @xmath108 , with @xmath109 for a chain with @xmath2 sites .      _",
    "possible applications_.  the edge localization has real - space effects on the dynamics , as revealed by our time evolution calculations ( section [ sec_dynamics ] and figure [ fig_3fermions10sites_dynamics ] ) .",
    "this raises the possibility of exploiting these effects for experimental quantum control of bosons or fermions in one - dimensional lattices . if one starts at a breather - band configuration that is not an edge state , the edge modes will not be excited , and conversely , fermions or bosons populated in an edge configuration remain stable in that configuration for a long time ( figure [ fig_3fermions10sites_dynamics ] ) .",
    "one can conceivably use this effect , arising from fine structures in the energy spectrum , to manipulate and select sites for a few - particle lattice system in cold - atom or quantum wire experiments .",
    "_ open issues_.  our work opens up a host of open questions and issues , of which we mention a few .",
    "first , our calculations shown in figure [ fig_gammadependence ] indicate that for moderate - sized lattices , edge localization persists in some form at weak interactions .",
    "the fate of this weak - interaction localization for large lattice sizes remains an un - resolved question .",
    "our work with two separate hamiltonians results suggest that edge localization is a generic phenomena for quantum lattice models .",
    "analogous phenomena can possibly be found in other one - dimensional itinerant fermionic and bosonic models .",
    "it is obviously of interest to investigate this phenomenon in various other quantum chain models , such as the one - dimensional fermionic hubbard and extended hubbard models . in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation",
    ", one can find localized states at all lattice sites , both bulk and edge @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for three or four bosons we have only found localization of all particles at the edge , even though some of our localized states have a finite width of more than one site .",
    "can the bose - hubbard model support solitons some distance away from the edge , perhaps at larger boson numbers ?    finally ,",
    "since edge - localized classical breathers are known for two - dimensional lattices @xcite , there is the intriguing possibility of edge states in two - dimensional quantum lattices , which remains unexplored at present .",
