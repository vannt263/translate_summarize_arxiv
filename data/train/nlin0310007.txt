    "a plane wave scattering onto a medium which possess a natural forbidden band gap , is totally reflected if its frequency falls in the gap .",
    "such may not be the case if the medium is nonlinear , as the sine - gordon model considered in @xcite where the incident wave was shown to generate , above some amplitude threshold , a sequence of nonlinear modes propagating in the medium .",
    "this threshold was given an analytic expression in @xcite ( still in the sine - gordon case ) and the property of the nonlinear medium to transmit energy in the gap has been called _",
    "nonlinear supratransmission_. it has been shown then to hold for different models ( nonlinear klein - gordon , double sine - gordon , josephson transmission lines ) , and has been experimentally realized on a chain of coupled pendula @xcite .",
    "energy transmission by gap soliton generation is a phenomenon that has been experimentally discovered in bragg media with kerr nonlinearity @xcite . in that case",
    "the underlying simplified model is the _ coupled mode system _ @xcite and it has been recently demonstrated that the very mechanism of the switch from a bragg mirror to a medium with high transmissivity is the nonlinear supratransmission @xcite .",
    "again there the theory allows for an analytic expression of the threshold amplitude , based on the expression of the soliton solution of the coupled mode system found in @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate here that the process of nonlinear supratransmission is a natural consequence of a generic instability of the evanescent profile generated in a nonlinear medium when it is constrained at one end by a periodic boundary driving of frequency in a forbidden band gap .",
    "let us consider the lagrangian of a scalar field @xmath0 in the half - plane @xmath1 @xmath2 the equation of motion @xmath3 reads @xmath4 where _ prime _ denotes differentiation with respect to the argument .",
    "the wave equation is submitted to dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath5 associated with cauchy initial data @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which can be vanishing or adapted to the boundary forcing .",
    "note that this approach can be extended to neumann boundary conditions .    from now on we",
    "adopt the quite generic assumtion of a potential energy @xmath8 which possess a local minimum locally symmetric . by a convenient choice of the reference frame",
    ", this minimum can be taken to be located at @xmath9 .",
    "then the symmetric requirement means that the potential is _ locally _ an even function of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , by a convenient choice of the units of @xmath11 and @xmath12 we can always scale the value of @xmath13 to the value @xmath14 . in summary",
    "the potential @xmath8 obeys the following requirements @xmath15 note that the _ local parity assumption _",
    "@xmath16 is not essential but simplifies the expressions .    as a consequence the equation , by taylor expansion of @xmath17 about the minimum @xmath18 , has the linear limit @xmath19 with dispersion relation @xmath20 having the gap @xmath21 $ ] in the frequency .",
    "the second restiction is on the class of boundary datum @xmath22 which we take to be a periodic forcing with a frequency belonging to the forbidden band gap .",
    "more precisely we assume @xmath23 this problem is quite generic and describes e.g. the scattering of a monochromatic wave into a medium in one of its forbidden band gaps .    for the linear limit , the boundary condition would generate the solution ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 called the linear evanescent wave .",
    "this solution is a reasonable approximate solution of the nonlinear evolution as long as the amplitude @xmath26 is small enough .",
    "we show hereafter that in the nonlinear case , under some additional simple conditions on the potential @xmath8 , the medium can present _ nonlinear supratransmission _ as a result of a fundamental instability generated by the evanescent wave , above some threshold for the amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "let us start with the simplest nonlinear correction resulting from the assumption , namely the nonlinear wave equation @xmath27 where the nonlinear factor @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29    it is essential to remark at this step that the first effect of the nonlinearity on a boundary driving is to _ deform _ the ( linear ) evanescent profile .",
    "such a deformation can be illustrated analytically and numerically in the static case @xmath30 in .",
    "indeed the equation with @xmath31 for @xmath32 submitted to @xmath33 , possess the solution @xmath34 this is the profile displayed on the figure [ fig : profiles ] with @xmath35 ( full line ) in perfect agreement to numerical simulations ( dots ) .",
    "the numerical method is explained in the appendix and here we have solved with a boundary datum @xmath36 slowly increasing from @xmath37 to the value @xmath35 and the solution ( represented by the crosses in fig . [",
    "fig : profiles ] ) is plotted long after the boundary datum has been setteled .",
    "we have plotted also for comparaison to the exponential ( linear ) shape namely @xmath38 ( dashed line ) .    in the dynamical case ( @xmath39 )",
    "we denote by @xmath40 the _ deformed evanescent profile _ , solution of , hence required to obey the boundary value , namely @xmath41 although this solution @xmath40 may not be known analytically , we shall actually discover that the worst approximation of it , namely the linear evanescent profile @xmath42 itself , still generates the seeked instability , hence providing a qualitative understanding of the generation of nonlinear supratransmission .",
    "the second effect of the boundary driving is obtained by studying the perturbation of the exact solution @xmath40 of as @xmath43 at order @xmath44 , the evolution for the perturbation @xmath45 then reads @xmath46=0\\ , \\quad v(x , t)=\\frac12\\alpha u_1 ^ 2(x , t)\\ .\\ ] ] this linear wave equation in the potential @xmath47 on the semi - axis @xmath24 is our main tool and contains all the ingredients required for a qualitative description of the onset of instability .",
    "the linear equation can be thought of as a two - dimensional scattering problem on the half - plane for a potential which is periodic in the infinite @xmath12-dimension and localized around @xmath48 in the positive @xmath11-direction .",
    "the study of this mixed periodic - localized 2d scattering problem is a tough technical question that we report in a future investigation .",
    "however we show hereafter that the instability can be qualitatively understood by considering the _ static case _ where @xmath47 is assumed to depend only on the space variable @xmath11 .",
    "the scattering problem can then be reduced to the radial s - wave schrdinger spectral problem @xmath49\\psi(\\zeta , x)=0\\ , \\ ] ] for the spectral parameter @xmath50 and eigenfunction @xmath51 defined by @xmath52 we argue then that equation develops an instability if the potential @xmath47 possess a bound state , say @xmath53 , with _ sufficient energy _ , namely if @xmath54 which causes the first order correction @xmath55 to diverge in time .",
    "in particular it is clear from that the instability will develop only when @xmath56 as a necessary ( not sufficient ) condition to have a bound state for @xmath47 . in order to allow for a comparaison with sine - gordon , and",
    "because the value of @xmath28 in can be scaled with @xmath26 , we set @xmath57    the potential @xmath58 is obtained from the _ deformed evanescent profile _ @xmath40 by considering its extremum on a period , namely we take @xmath59 we now illustrate the obtained expression for the threshold of instability for two particular choices for @xmath60 , first the linear evanescent profile , second a standard sech - type profile .",
    "both cases allow for an explicit computation of this threshold and we compare in figure [ fig : compare - seuil ] these results to numerical simulation of the pde .",
    "the choice @xmath61 $ ] for @xmath62 provides from the following spectral problem on the half - line @xmath63\\psi(\\zeta , x)=0\\ .\\ ] ] the two ( positve , real - valued ) parameters are the amplitude @xmath26 and the _ wave number _ @xmath64 .",
    "the direct scattering problem @xcite essentially consists in finding the jost solution of which can be written @xmath65 this solution is usually written in terms of the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath66 .",
    "we find it more convenient to express it in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function @xmath67 .",
    "indeed it readily provides the asymptotic behavior @xmath68 and the jost function @xmath69    the bound states are the zeroes of this jost function in the upper complex @xmath50-plane , actually located on the imaginary axis as the potential is real valued .",
    "our instability criterion then tells that an instability for @xmath55 will develops as soon as the amplitude @xmath26 reaches the value @xmath70 for which the first bound state reaches the value @xmath71 .",
    "this occurs for each value of the parameter @xmath72 and thus the threshold @xmath73 is defined by the implicit equation @xmath74 we have solved this equation numerically and the result is plotted in terms of @xmath75 in the left figure [ fig : compare - seuil ] .",
    "it is compared there with the results of the numerical solution ( see appendix ) of ( with @xmath31 ) submitted to the boundary driving , namely @xmath76 .",
    "although the theoretical threshold does not fit perfectly the simulations , the principle of the nonlinear supratransmission is qualitatively understood .",
    "the discrepancy results both from the asumption of an exponential profile for @xmath40 and a static approximation of it .",
    "a better fit is obtained by assuming instead of the exponential profile the following sech - type profile obtained from the solution at its maximum amplitude ( i.e. for @xmath77 where the instability is expected ) @xmath78 the presence of a periodic boundary datum is taken into account by the parameter @xmath72 ( wave number ) .",
    "this choice is expected to give good results for small @xmath79 and it leads to the spectral problem @xmath80\\psi(\\zeta , x)=0\\ .\\ ] ] this potential belongs to the eckart class @xcite and its jost solution reads @xmath81 with the parameter @xmath82 this solution does obey the asymptotic and the jost function is @xmath83    according to the instability criterion we then seek the value @xmath70 for the threshold amplitude generating a bound state ( zero of this jost function on the upper imaginary @xmath50-axis ) at the value @xmath71 . from @xcite we can write also as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the standard euler gamma function that possess poles at @xmath86 .    the bound states are thus given by the poles of the function @xmath87 on the positive imaginary @xmath50-axis , and the first bound state reaches the point @xmath71 as soon as @xmath88 verifies @xmath89 replacing there the value of the parameter @xmath88 , the threshold of instability @xmath70 can then be expressed in terms of @xmath75 as @xmath90 this is the curve represented in the right graph of figure [ fig : compare - seuil ] .",
    "we see then that the sech - like profile provides as expected a much better fit of the instability threshold , especially for small @xmath79 where the static approximation becomes more accurate .",
    "so far we have demonstrated the existence of an onset of instability in the nonlinear simple model ( with @xmath56 ) . in that case",
    "the instability causes the solution to diverge because the related potential @xmath91 is not confining for large @xmath10 .    to illustrate the nonlinear supratransmission as an effect of the instability",
    ", we consider now the sine - gordon case @xmath92 treated in @xcite , namely @xmath93 in this situation , the solution induced by the boundary datum of amplitude _ below _ the threshold of instability is the _ non - travelling _ breather @xmath94\\ , \\quad x_b<0\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the breather center .",
    "the onset of nonlinear supratransmission is reached , at given frequency @xmath79 , for the maximum amplitude of @xmath96 , obtained of course for @xmath97 .",

    "this is why we have used numerical simulations and shown by figure [ fig : sg ] that the stationary limit does produce a consistent result : the threshold of instability of the pde obtained by varying @xmath107 , at each fixed @xmath79 , fits suprisingly well the exact prediction .",

    "the instability comes into play and generates a nonlinear mode that propagates in the medium carrying energy , what have been called nonlinear supratransmission and have been experimentally realized on a chain of pendula @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that a nonlinear medium , under some generic conditions on the structure of the nonlinearity ( existence of a forbidden band gap , local minimum for the potential , ... ) may create an instability of the evanescent profile generated by a periodic boundary driving at a frequency in the gap .",
    "this instability is the generating process at the origin of nonlinear supratransmission , when the nonlinear medium supports nonlinear modes ( breathers , solitons , kinks , ... ) .",
    "the instability has been described by using a stationary limit for the evanescent profile which has allowed us to prove that the occurence of the instability is related to the appearence of a bound state with sufficient energy , according to .",
    "we have dealt here with a scalar wave - like equation and it is worth mentionning that the process works also for different types of systems like for instance the coupled mode equations in bragg media @xcite . the generating instability in this case will be considered in a future work .",
