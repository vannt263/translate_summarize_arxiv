    "evidence has been accumulated both from astrophysics and cosmology that about 1/4 of the energy budget of the present universe consists of the so - called ( cold ) dark matter ( dm ) , namely , a component which is non - relativistic and neither feels the electromagnetic nor the the strong interaction .",
    "it is fair to say that the most popular dm candidate for a wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supersymmetric models with @xmath4-parity conservation .",
    "leaving aside the axion and the axino , the superpartners with the right properties for playing the role of a wimp in the universe are the gravitino and the lightest neutralino ( @xmath5 ) - by far , the most discussed case in the literature .",
    "although the lhc is running smoothly and collecting large amounts of data useful to look for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , other complementary facilities are certainly needed , especially concerning dm detection . in fact , dama / libra , cogent , and more recently cresst experiments have reported the observation of events in excess of the expected background , hinting at the existence of a light wimp  @xcite",
    ". however , exclusion limits set by other direct searches , such as xenon10  @xcite and xenon100  @xcite , are in tension with the above claims .    in the nmssm , a light neutralino ( as a dm candidate )",
    "can efficiently annihilate through the resonant s - channel via a light pseudoscalar higgs mediator satisfying the requirements from the relic density  @xcite .",
    "however , following a scan of the nmssm parameter space , the authors of @xcite obtained upper limits on the spin - independent ( si ) @xmath5-nucleon cross section which are substantially below the requirements of dama and cogent .",
    "the spin - dependent ( sd ) cross section ( via @xmath6-exchange ) was also found several orders of magnitude below current experimental bounds . on the other hand ,",
    "the authors of @xcite were able to achieve a somewhat larger si cross section in a similar scenario .",
    "admittedly , such cross sections can be further enhanced by increasing the @xmath7-quark content of the nucleon , but the agreement with the low range of dama results turns out to be only marginally acceptable .    in this work",
    "we revisit sd @xmath5-nucleon scattering via pseudocalar - exchange in the nmssm , usually neglected in most analyses @xcite , which however might be enhanced due to a non - perturbative mechanism as later argued .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm contains six independent parameters : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , whose definitions can be found elsewhere  @xcite . notice that @xmath10 is generated as the vev of the singlet field @xmath11 ; it is also useful to define @xmath12 .",
    "two physical pseudoscalar states appear in the spectrum of the nmssm as superpositions of the mssm - like state @xmath13 and the singlet - like state @xmath14 .",
    "in particular for the lightest cp - odd higgs boson @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the mixing angle  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 reduced coupling @xmath18 to down - type quarks and leptons ( normalized with respect to the coupling of the cp - even higgs boson of the sm ) reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 .    an analysis of a particular region of the nmssm parameter space where @xmath18 can be relatively large at high @xmath21 , together with a light cp - odd higgs boson ( @xmath22 gev ) , was carried out in @xcite although without including the relic abundance constraint .",
    "let us stress here again that this scenario is quite different from the pq - symmetry - limit ( @xmath23 ) or r - symmetry - limit ( @xmath24 ) , where @xmath18 remains moderate even in the large @xmath21 limit . although not motivated by any symmetry as in the latter cases , we remark that @xmath25 for large values of @xmath26 @xcite , giving consistency to our scenario which implies ( relatively ) small values of @xmath27 .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite a large @xmath18 could induce a non - negligible mixing of the cp - odd state and @xmath28 hadronic resonances . for the sake of simplicity , we only consider the @xmath17 mixing with the nearest ( in mass ) pseudoscalar resonance , generically denoted hereafter as @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the @xmath17 and @xmath2 physical states can be written approximately as @xmath30 where subindex zero refers to unmixed states throughout .",
    "( the dominant components may of course be reversed if @xmath31 . ) in any event , one should keep in mind that the @xmath32 can mix ( to a greater or lesser extent ) with more than a single pseudoscalar hadronic state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the strength of the mixing is determined by the angle @xmath33 given by  @xcite [ eq : alpha ] 2  =  ^-1/2 , where the imaginary part has been neglected and @xmath34 can be computed by means of a non - relativistic quark potential model : @xmath35 where @xmath36 gev and @xmath37 stands for the radial wave function at the origin of the corresponding @xmath29 state ( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , a substantial mixing of a @xmath0 gev cp - odd higgs boson with @xmath29 resonances can modify ( hindering ) a signal based on direct observation of a monochromatic peak in the photon spectrum of radiative @xmath1 decays @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a light cp - odd higgs could still show up as a slight breaking of lepton universality in the ratio @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes the tauonic , and @xmath40 the electronic ( @xmath41 ) or muonic ( @xmath42 ) branching ratios of the @xmath1 resonance , respectively @xcite .",
    "in view of the greatly improved accuracy of the recent measurements of the leptonic bfs ( and likely so in the forthcoming babar analysis of @xmath43 decays @xcite ) , it seems advisable to remove the dependence on the final - state lepton mass ( @xmath44 ) dividing the branching fraction ( bf ) by @xmath45 , which behaves as a ( smoothly ) decreasing function of @xmath46 : @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "therefore defining @xmath49 the contribution of a pseudoscalar higgs to the ( inclusive ) decay rate would imply an enhancement of the tauonic mode and therefore small but positive values of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the experimental results obtained from the pdg listing @xcite are shown in table  1 .",
    "the good agreement of the @xmath51 measurements with the sm expectations , together with the systematic disagreement of the @xmath1 family , are consistent with a slight enhancement of the tauonic decay mode of @xmath1 resonances versus the electronic and muonic decay modes , due to an extra contribution of a light pseudoscalar higgs boson , which couples to down - type quarks ( at large @xmath21 ) but of negligible effect for up - type quarks in this limit .",
    "furthermore , unexpected values for the hyperfine splittings in the bottomonium spectrum : @xmath52 ( @xmath53 )  @xcite can be induced by the mixing ( [ eq : mixing1]-[eq : mixing2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath54 mev obtained by babar and cleo using hindered radiative @xmath43 decays @xcite appears to be significantly larger than expected from perturbative qcd , estimated to be @xmath55 mev @xcite .",
    "however , the recent belle measurement of the @xmath56 mass based on the @xmath57 decay @xcite leads to @xmath58 mev , in very good agreement with lattice nrqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "note in passing that the discovery of the @xmath59 state and its mass determination would provide a crucial check when compared to the lattice prediction for @xmath60 @xcite .      in order to assess the impact of the @xmath61 mixing on dm phenomenology",
    ", we first have to review the present bounds from b physics , lep and dm relic abundance .",
    "to this aim the latest version of nmssmtools @xcite was employed to scan the nmssm parameter space with micromegas turned on in the main code .",
    "we focus on a narrow mass window for @xmath17 , where current experimental constraints still permit large @xmath18 values @xcite under examination in this paper .",

    "it is also worth noting that if condition _",
    "iii ) _ is removed from the scan , the allowed values of @xmath18 become higher , notably about @xmath88 since the aforementioned resonant condition does not apply anymore .",

    "next we address neutralino elastic scattering off nuclei based on our analysis of the nmssm parameter space . as is well - known , the si scattering cross section is enhanced by a coherent factor proportional to the atomic number squared @xmath93 . for sd interactions ,",
    "the cross section depends on the total spin of the nucleus and is typically a factor @xmath93 smaller .",
    "the total wimp - nucleus cross section has contributions from both the si and sd interactions , though one contribution is expected to dominate the other depending on the target nucleus ( e.g. according to the even / odd number of protons and neutrons ) and the detection technique employed in the experiment .",
    "the contributions to the si cross section arise in the interaction lagrangian of the wimp with quarks and gluons of the nucleon from scalar and vector couplings whereas the sd part is attributed to the axial - vector couplings .",
    "pseudoscalar interaction is usually neglected because of a strong velocity and/or momentum transfer suppression .",
    "nevertheless , momentum - dependent interactions have been put forward   @xcite in order to alleviate the tension between the dama signal and the null results from other experiments . in this work",
    "we propose that a significant @xmath61 mixing could dramatically modify the sd @xmath5-nucleon cross section , in analogy with the well - known _ vector - meson - dominance model _",
    "( vmd ) for electron ( or real photon ) scattering off nuclei @xcite , where the virtual ( or real ) photon interacts with nucleons via one of its hadronic components . in fig .  2 we depict two graphs illustrating how the mixing of a pseudoscalar ( left ) , or a photonic mediator ( right ) , with hadronic resonances can modify the effective coupling to the nucleon for wimp and electron scattering , respectively .",
    "likewise , a similar mechanism could be envisaged for the mixing of scalar resonances ( e.g. @xmath94 states ) and a light enough cp - even higgs boson .",
    "however , it is widely accepted that , contrary to the cp - odd higgs , present bounds exclude a @xmath0 gev scalar boson with relatively large couplings to quarks and leptons ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the lightest scalar higgs state in our nmssm scan has a mass @xmath95 $ \\sim$}}~}110 $ ]  gev , whereby the mixing with hadronic states would be negligible .",
    "the axial - vector and pseudoscalar @xmath96 couplings defined via @xmath97 lead to a @xmath3-suppression factor at the rate level , where @xmath98 is the momentum transfer of the neutralino to the nucleon .",
    "an additional @xmath3 factor stems from the @xmath99 vertex , yielding altogether a @xmath100 suppression factor in the scattering cross section , where @xmath101 stands for the target and neutralino mass , respectively .    the effective coupling to the nucleon of either the mixed @xmath17 or @xmath2 state via its hadronic component reads @xmath102 respectively , where the mixing angle @xmath33 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) .    in turn , the effective coupling of either the mixed @xmath17 or @xmath2 state to the neutralino reads [ eq : geff3 ] g_a_1^eff= g_a_10  ,   g__b^eff=- g_a_10 respectively , as a result of its higgs component .     or @xmath2 state ) to the neutralino sd scattering cross section .",
    "right : vector - meson - dominance model in the electron scattering off nucleons @xcite where vector resonances ( @xmath103 can couple to the exchanged photon . ]    let us remark that both @xmath17 and @xmath2 are considered as physical states in our model , i.e. mass eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian without transitions among their constituents apart from interactions with external particles .",
    "note , however , that the wimp scattering off nuclei takes place at very low momentum transfer , so that the pseudoscalar mediator in fig.2 is quite off - shell . to the extent that the interaction amplitude is not too sensitive to the energy difference between on - shell and off - shell states , should our model make sense .    on the other hand , let us note that the @xmath6-boson coupling to the neutralino ( @xmath104 ) should be of the same order as the @xmath32 coupling , but the @xmath32-coupling to strange quarks would be tiny ( especially for a dominantly singlet - like @xmath32 ) as compared to the @xmath6-boson coupling to nucleons ( @xmath105 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the effective coupling ( [ eq : geff1 ] ) of mixed @xmath106 states to the latter could be significantly enhanced via a non - perturbative effect .",
    "indeed , the experimental value @xmath107 \\simeq 10^{-3}$ ] @xcite turns out to be unexpectedly large in view of the helicity suppression resulting in a perturbative framework . even after including finite mass effects ,",
    "a discrepancy of three or four orders of magnitude still remains with respect to theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "we shall return later to this point of paramount importance in our work , after examining the spin - dependent @xmath5-nucleon cross section mediated by a pseudoscalar higgs versus a @xmath6-boson .",
    "the @xmath5-nucleon scattering cross section with @xmath106 mixing ( @xmath108 ) can be estimated from the ratio @xmath109@xmath110 , where @xmath111 denotes the @xmath6-exchange sd cross section , according to : @xmath112 ^ 2 \\biggl[\\frac{g_{\\eta_{b0}nn}}{g_{znn}}\\biggr]^2 \\biggl[\\frac{90 ( \\mathrm{gev})}{m_{a_1}}\\biggr]^4\\ \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\biggl[\\frac{q^2}{m_{n,\\chi}^2}\\biggr]^2 f^2[m_{a_{1}},m_{\\eta_b},q^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 $ ] takes into account the interference effect due to the sign difference in eqs.([eq : geff1]-[eq : geff3 ] ) . at vanishing @xmath3 and the range of masses considered in this work",
    ", one gets @xmath114 $ ] @xmath115 .",
    "actually a summation over all possible mixed states should be understood in ( [ eq : r ] ) , albeit with variable weight depending on both their mixing strength and the effective @xmath116-nucleon coupling .",
    "let us first examine the ratio [ ration ] ^2  ^2_a , with @xmath117 denoting the different ( bino , higgsino ... ) components of the lightest neutralino , and the couplings @xmath118 and @xmath119 satisfy : @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the weinberg angle .",
    "bounds from the invisible decay width of the @xmath6-boson imply that @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , in our scan we always find @xmath123 close to unity ( at large @xmath21 where also @xmath124 ) , and @xmath125 $ ] ; hence we can write [ ration2 ] ^2 ~o(10 ^ -1 - 1 ) . setting @xmath126 gev , @xmath127 ( typically expected from ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ) and @xmath3 @xmath128 as reference values",
    ", we are led to [ eq : ratiog ]  o(10 ^ 3 ) , so that the @xmath17/@xmath2 exchange channel would become comparable numerically to the @xmath6-exchange , i.e. @xmath129 .    naively one would expect the above ratio to be of order @xmath130 ( where @xmath131 and @xmath132 denote the strong interaction and electromagnetic coupling strengths , respectively ) which hardly can yield such a large factor .",
    "yet a big enhancement of ( [ eq : ratiog ] ) could be plausible if a non - perturbative mechanism contributes to the @xmath29-nucleon coupling , as it likely happens in the @xmath133 decay into a @xmath134 pair ( though at quite larger @xmath3 ) .",
    "indeed , an explanation of the large observed @xmath135 decay rate seems to require a fundamental modification of the perturbative approach to account for this decay mode .",
    "different proposals have been put forward in terms of a non - perturbative mechanism : mixing of the resonance and gluonium states @xcite , instanton effects @xcite , intermediate meson loop contribution  @xcite or higher fock components @xcite . despite many uncertainties ,",
    "it is conceivable that a long - distance contribution also affects @xmath116 resonances .",
    "let us focus hereafter on instanton effects , which play a fundamental role in understanding the qcd vacuum and many other topics related to hadronic physics , especially concerning light hadrons ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "nevertheless , instanton effects can still be relevant in heavy quark systems , e.g. for the non - perturbative gluon condensate in charmonium @xcite .    in particular , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite studied the instanton contribution to non - perturbative chiral symmetry breaking in proton - proton scattering at high energy .",
    "the same authors later considered this interaction contributing to the decay of the @xmath136 resonance into a @xmath134 pair @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the meson resonance annihilates into two gluons ( perturbative part ) that are absorbed by instantons , which couple to a baryon pair ( non - perturbative part ) .    in the following we envisage whether such an instanton - induced interaction could still affect the @xmath2 resonance coupling to baryons for a momentum transfer from @xmath137 down to @xmath138 mev .",
    "if so , the wimp scattering off nuclei might then bear an unexpected resemblance to @xmath139-@xmath139 elastic scattering ( at small @xmath140 ) .",
    "instanton effects are usually assumed to depend linearly on the instanton density given by @xcite : [ eq : exp ] ~  [ _ s(^-1)]^-6 , where @xmath141 denotes the instanton size ( such that @xmath142 ) .",
    "quite in general , instanton effects are expected to be weighted by the euclidean instanton action of the exponential factor in eq.([eq : exp ] ) , becoming more relevant at smaller @xmath3 ( hence larger @xmath131 ) .",
    "now , in order to obtain an estimate of the @xmath143 decay rate within this framework , we first rescale the perturbative part of the calculation in @xcite to the bottomonium system according to :     0.3 , where the wave function of the spin - singlet state can be approximated by the corresponding spin - triplet one @xcite .    turning now to the non - perturbative part of the calculation",
    ", we will assume ( as usual ) that the instanton - induced coupling to nucleons depends on the number of instantons @xmath144 relevant in the process , obtained by integration of the instanton density ( [ eq : exp ] ) over @xmath145 .",
    "note that the resulting value should be controlled by the exponential dependence on @xmath141 around the inverse mass of the heavy resonance .",
    "varying the momentum transfer to baryons , from @xmath146 to @xmath147 , @xmath144 decreases roughly by two orders of magnitude , hence lowering the rate ( which depends on @xmath148 ) by about four orders of magnitude .    even though phase space favours the @xmath149 decay rate with respect to the @xmath136 by a factor @xmath150 , we finally conclude , taking into account both perturbative and non - perturbative parts , that the partial width @xmath151 $ ] induced by instanton effects should be about four orders of magnitude ( though with large uncertainties ) smaller than @xmath152 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding bf can be obtained making use of the central value for the @xmath56 full width @xmath153 mev , recently found by belle @xcite .    in sum , our order - of - magnitude estimate based on instanton - induced interaction reads : [ eq : bfeta ] b[_b p|p ] 10 ^ -7 - 10 ^ -6    yet the @xmath56 can decay into a @xmath134 pair at an observable rate at b ( super ) factories @xcite . the experimental determination of ( [ eq : bfeta ] ) thus becomes relevant to uncover possible non - perturbative effects ( the present upper limit being @xmath154 @xcite ) associated to the @xmath2 state , permitting a reliable comparison with perturbative qcd predictions because of the heavier bottom mass .    on the other hand ,",
    "as already commented , instanton - induced effects should become quite more important at low momentum transfer because of the exponential in eq.([eq : exp ] ) .",
    "thus , a sizable non - perturbative effect in @xmath2 decays into baryons occurring at @xmath155 should be enhanced ( actually less suppressed ) at the much lower energy scale set by the small momentum transfer in wimp scattering off nuclei , @xmath98 @xmath156 . however ,",
    "extrapolation to such low @xmath98 value from the @xmath136 or @xmath2 mass requires a further and detailed examination @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our previous caveat concerning the off - shellness of the pseudoscalar mediator of fig.2 is in order as indeed @xmath157 . in particular",
    ", its hadronic component could display in the nucleon - nucleon vertex a different behaviour than an on - shell @xmath2 resonance .",
    "similarly , in a non - covariant language , one can invoke the time - energy uncertainty principle implying that the time for a virtual @xmath158 pair is likely too short for the @xmath2 bound state to be formed .",
    "therefore the above calculation of the perturbative part can not not straightforwardly be applied .",
    "nonetheless , quantum numbers of the virtual @xmath158 pair should still correspond to a pseudoscalar state thereby permitting two gluons to be emitted , ultimately leading to instanton - induced ( spin - dependent ) effective interaction of wimps with nuclei .",
    "conversely , such a mechanism should not significantly affect neutralino annihilation into sm particles via a @xmath7-channel exchange of a cp - odd higgs boson , for the energy scale would be again of order @xmath0 gev , thereby avoiding an extra tension with indirect detection limits , such as cosmic - ray antiprotons @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have considered a particular scenario within the nmssm with both a light neutralino and a light cp - odd higgs boson , the latter sizably mixing with pseudoscalar @xmath2 resonances .",
    "implicit in our work is the idea that non - perturbative effects ( e.g. instanton - induced interaction ) may lead to a non - negligible pseudoscalar contribution to the @xmath5-nucleus scattering , thereby introducing a momentum - dependent form factor in the cross section which might be helpful ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) to interpret the results of direct dm search experiments , with variable sensitivity along the nuclear recoil energy range .    to conclude we",
