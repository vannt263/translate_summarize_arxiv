    "the exploration of symmetries and their breaking have always been an active and interesting area of research in nuclear physics .",
    "one of the well known examples , that can be cited here , is the nuclear @xmath3 decay which violates parity that led to the discovery of the weak interaction .",
    "our present concern , however , is the strong interaction where , in particular , we focus attention to the charge symmetry violation ( csv ) in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction .",
    "charge symmetry implies invariance of the @xmath4 interaction under rotation in isospin space , which in nature , is violated .",
    "the csv , at the fundamental level is caused by the finite mass difference between up @xmath5 and down @xmath6 quarks @xcite . as a consequence , at the hadronic level , charge symmetry ( cs )",
    "is violated due to non - degenerate mass of hadrons of the same isospin multiplet .",
    "the general goal of the research in this area is to find small but observable effects of csv which might provide significant insight into the strong interaction dynamics .",
    "there are several experimental data which indicate csv in @xmath4 interaction .",
    "for instance , the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering lengths at @xmath9s@xmath10 state is non - zero @xcite",
    ". other convincing evidence of csv comes from the binding energy difference of mirror nuclei which is known as okamoto - nolen - schifer ( ons ) anomaly @xcite .",
    "the modern manifestation of csv includes difference of neutron - proton form factors , hadronic correction to @xmath11 @xcite , the observation of the decay of @xmath12 etc @xcite .",
    "in nuclear physics , one constructs csv potential to see its consequences on various observables .",
    "the construction of csv potential involves evaluation of the @xmath4 scattering diagrams with intermediate states that include mixing of various isospin states like @xmath1-@xmath2 or @xmath13-@xmath14 mesons .",
    "the former is found to be most dominant @xcite which we consider here .",
    "most of the calculations performed initially to construct csv potential considered the on - shell @xcite or constant @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude @xcite , which are claimed to be successful in explaining various csv observables @xcite .",
    "this success has been called into question @xcite on the ground of the use of on - shell mixing amplitude for the construction of csv potential .",
    "first in @xcite and then in @xcite , it is shown that the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing has strong momentum dependence which even changes its sign as one moves away from the @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) pole to the space - like region which is relevant for the construction of the csv potential",
    ". therefore inclusion of off - shell corrections are necessary for the calculation of csv potential .",
    "we here deal with such mixing amplitude induced by the @xmath15-@xmath15 loop incorporating off - shell corrections .    in vacuum ,",
    "the charge symmetry is broken explicitly due to the non - degenerate nucleon masses . in matter",
    ", there can be another source of symmetry breaking if the ground state contains unequal number of neutrons ( @xmath16 ) and protons ( @xmath17 ) giving rise to ground state induced mixing of various charged states like @xmath1-@xmath2 meson even in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "this additional source of symmetry breaking for the construction of csv potential has , to the best of our knowledge , not been considered before .",
    "the possibility of such matter induced mixing was first studied in @xcite and was subsequently studied in @xcite . for the case of @xmath13-@xmath14 meson also",
    "such asymmetry driven mixing is studied in @xcite . but",
    "none of these deal with the construction of two - body potential and the calculations are mostly confined to the time - like region where the main motivation is to investigate the role of such matter induced mixing on the dilepton spectrum observed in heavy ion collisions , pion form factor , meson dispersion relations etc . @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", attempt has been made to calculate the density dependent csv potential where only the effect of the scalar mean field on the nucleon mass is considered excluding the possibility of matter driven mixing .",
    "all existing matter induced mixing calculations , however , suggest that , at least in the @xmath1-@xmath2 sector , the inclusion of such a matter induced mixing amplitude into the two body @xmath4 interaction potential can significantly change the results both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "it is also to be noted that such mixing amplitudes , in asymmetric nuclear matter ( anm ) , have non - zero contribution even if the quark or nucleon masses are taken to be equal @xcite .",
    "we consider both of these mechanisms to construct the csv potential .",
    "physically , in dense system , intermediate mesons might be absorbed and re - emitted from the fermi spheres .",
    "in symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) the emission and absorption involving different isospin states like @xmath1 and @xmath2 cancel when the contributions of both the proton and neutron fermi spheres are added provided the nucleon masses are taken to be equal . in anm , on the other hand , the unbalanced contributions coming from the scattering of neutron and proton fermi spheres , lead to the mixing which depends both on the density @xmath19 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "inclusion of this process is depicted by the second diagram in fig.[fig00 ] represented by @xmath21 which is non - zero even in symmetric nuclear matter if explicit mass differences of nucleons are retained . in the first diagram",

    "the other important element which we include here is the contribution coming from the external legs .",
    "this is another source of explicit symmetry violation which significantly modify the csv potential in vacuum as has been shown only recently by the present authors @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
