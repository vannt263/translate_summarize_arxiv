    "one - way waveguides are important building blocks for many functional systems in acoustics and electromagnetics .",
    "they find applications as isolators and circulators , as a mean to reduce disorder effects in waveguides @xcite , or even as a mean to match waveguide to a load @xcite or to a leaky wave nano - antenna @xcite .",
    "non - reciprocity and one - way guiding can be achieved either by medium s non - linearities , by spatiotemporal modulation , or by magnetic biasing .",
    "non - linear non - reciprocal structures @xcite use the fact that reciprocity does not imply symmetric field distributions of the forward and backward propagating modes .",
    "therefore , spatially - varying material nonlinearity created in an initially reciprocal waveguide , may affect the two modes differently and eventually result in non - reciprocity .",
    "since it is based on nonlinear effects , this method requires large volumes , it is power - dependent , and may lead to signal distortion . alternatively ,",
    "spatiotemporal variation of the medium s properties may violate reciprocity .",
    "for example , by using a traveling wave to modulate the medium s constitutive parameters one may asymmetrically add a `` momentum '' ( wave number ) bias to the otherwise - symmetric mode picture .",
    "several non - reciprocal components and one - way waveguides have been proposed using this idea , for electromagnetic waves @xcite as well as for acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "these structures are linear and magnetic - biasing free . however , the modulation effect is usually quite weak thus yielding a narrow one - way bandwidth and a large device , many wavelengths long .",
    "the third way to violate reciprocity is using magneto - optical effects produced by static magnetic biasing under which ferrites and plasmas become gyrotropic .",
    "then , if a waveguide is asymmetrically loaded , isolation can be obtained @xcite .",
    "many of the recently proposed one - way schemes in optics are based on this idea @xcite . however , these structures have lateral width of at least one wavelength .",
    "ring resonators have been proposed as a mean to enhance non - reciprocity and reduce the device s size .",
    "the degeneracy of a pair of counter propagating modes can be removed by azimuthal spatiotemporal modulation @xcite , or by magnetization @xcite - yielding a mode - q - factor dependent isolation with device footprint of the order of a wavelength .",
    "along an apparently different research endeavor , linear periodic chains of equally - spaced identical plasmonic nano - particles were studied in a number of publications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "particle chains were proposed as guiding structures and junctions in @xcite-@xcite , as surface waves couplers @xcite , and as polarization - sensitive waveguides @xcite . when the inter - particle distance is sufficiently small , the guided optical wave in such chains is highly localized , i.e.  it s spatial width is much smaller than the wavelength that corresponds to the operation frequency .",
    "hence , they are termed as sub - diffraction chains ( sdc s ) .",
    "the chain green s function was calculated in @xcite , and the sdc s modal features were studied using a general approach and spectral analysis in @xcite and were also considered in @xcite .",
    "green s function theories revealing all the wave constituents that can be excited in these structures , were developed and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "scattering due to structural disorder and its effect on the modes were studied in @xcite , and in @xcite .",
    "propagation in curved sdc s has been considered recently in @xcite .",
    "the effect of liquid - crystal host of sdc s has been studied in @xcite , where the interesting option of dynamically controlled sdc is suggested .    in @xcite a family of magnetized plasmonic sdc s one - way waveguides , based on the ` two - type rotation' principle",
    "was proposed for one - way guiding and optical isolation .",
    "as has been shown there , exposing a conventional spherical particles sdc to external magnetic bias may formally create non - reciprocity due to the faraday rotation induced in the plasmonic particles .",
    "however , this is _ not sufficient for optical isolation _ since the resulting dispersion @xmath0 is still an even function and no preferred direction is created . to achieve the one - way property ,",
    "the suggested structures consist of magnetized , _ non - spherical _ , plasmonic particles arranged as a linear array .",
    "each particle in the array is rotated with respect to its neighbors , rendering the chain chiral .",
    "the interplay between the field polarization rotation due to the gyrotropy of the resonant particles and the structural chirality is utilized in order to enhance non - reciprocity and create uneven dispersion .",
    "significant optical isolation and one - way guiding are then obtained at operation points near the light - cone - see @xcite .",
    "these structures have two main advantages over other one - way schemes .",
    "first , as said above , the effective lateral width of the guided mode is much smaller than the wavelength .",
    "second , it has been shown that the required magnetic bias is considerably weaker than the bias used in other magnetization - based one - way schemes .",
    "this bias may be further reduced by utilizing the enhanced faraday rotation in a plasmonic particle consisting of a core - shell geometry such as the particles studied in @xcite . however , despite their appealing properties , a nanoscale fabrication of the proposed structures might be somewhat challenging due to the apparent requirement for a precisely characterized geometrical features in the particles .",
    "here we approach the problem of enhanced non - reciprocity from a wider point of view .",
    "our study provides the _ necessary _ conditions for uneven dispersion curves and one - way guiding in planar particle arrays , some examples of which are shown schematically in fig .",
    "the particles may or may not be identical and symmetric .",
    "the necessary conditions for uneven dispersion are characterized in the frieze symmetry - groups framework .",
    "the previously reported one - way chains based on the two - type rotation principle @xcite are shown to be a special case that conveys the narrowest structure ( but not the simplest to fabricate ) .",
    "one of the important conclusions of the present study is that _ almost any random construction _ of the structure s period would result , under magnetic bias , in uneven dispersion and may function as an optical isolator .",
    "in fact , due to the structural asymmetry requirements for uneven dispersion studied here , and due to the fact that fabrication errors are unavoidable , it may turn out that under magnetic bias uneven dispersion is easier to obtain than even dispersion .    ):",

    ", it has been shown that if the structure possesses inversion symmetry ( @xmath67 group ) , reflection symmetry with respect to the chain axis ( @xmath68 group ) , or glide - reflection symmetry ( @xmath69 group ) , an even dispersion is guaranteed even if the particles themselves possess non reciprocal property such as that arises e.g.  by magnetized plasmonic material .",
    "so far we have discussed the symmetries on the unit cell level . however , while the period length , @xmath8 , is unique , the choice of a unit cell is not .",
    "the latter always consists of @xmath14 particles , and there are up to @xmath14 different choices for the unit cell and even more possible @xmath70 ( due to the freedom of `` numbering '' the particles in the same unit cell @xcite ) .",
    "let us define the set @xmath71 as the set of all possible matrices @xmath70 for a certain structure .",
    "if the determinant of the matrix @xmath70 vanishes for a certain choice of the unit cell , then it must vanish for all @xmath71 - since all the matrices in @xmath71 represent the wave dynamics of the same structure .",
    "therefore , if the operations done on @xmath70 in the previous subsections do not result in the mentioned variations of the same @xmath70 but do result in these variations of one of the other matrices in @xmath71 then the structure must still possess even dispersion .",
    "for example , if the unit cell does not posses an inversion symmetry , but upon inverting the unit cell we obtain a differently structured unit cell , but of the exact same _ original , pre - inverted _ structure - then the dispersion is rendered even since the substitution @xmath72 still preserves the zero determinant . a good example for this is the @xmath73 group , displayed in fig .  [ fig1]d",
    ". a unit cell does not posses any of the discussed symmetries - invariance under @xmath4 or under @xmath2 . however , under @xmath2 we obtain a different unit cell of the same structure , and therefore it is reciprocal .",
    "this fact helps us finally establish the list of frieze groups that host even dispersions : @xmath68 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "uneven dispersion can only be found in groups @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "consider a periodic chain whose period is randomly generated ( e.g.  randomly locating @xmath14 particles inside the period ) .",
    "clearly , for @xmath79 the notion of randomness becomes meaningless . for @xmath80 and if @xmath81 , one may verify that the period would always be invariant under @xmath4 , i.e. it resides in the * p2 * group and hence it possesses an even dispersion .",
    "note that this argument holds only for dipole - moment excitation .",
    "if higher order excitations become relevant ( e.g.  quadrupoles ) , then the above conclusion may not hold .",
    "however , for @xmath82 nearly any random construction would reside in the * p1 * group whether the particles are identical or not , yielding uneven dispersion under magnetic bias ( see sec .",
    "[ seq : ex ] below ) .      a new family of metasurfaces , termed as",
    "_ metaweaves _ , can be obtained by invoking a procedure of `` weaving '' one - way particle chains ( one - way `` threads '' ) .",
    "the resulting surface possesses a novel `` @xmath83 sector - way '' dynamics : when the surface is excited by a point dipole it allows the propagation of trapped modes only into a cone whose vertex - angle is @xmath83 .",
    "this structure has been suggested and studied in @xcite . with the present approach , however , one may design non - reciprocal sector - way metasurfaces without the need to directly `` weave '' one - way threads .",
    "generally , the symmetries of such metasurfaces can be studied in the framework of the wallpaper groups in a manner similar to the study in the previous subsections",
    ". however , there are 17 symmetry groups , hence for brevity we use here a rule of thumb ( see example below ) . to achieve sector - way dynamics it is sufficient to create a periodic metasurface whose period does not possess @xmath84 , and @xmath4 symmetries ( i.e.  the two - dimensional period should not be invariant under these operations ) .",
    "consider a particle with no circular symmetry , but with an isotropic ( scalar ) polarizability when not magnetized .",
    "a cube made of isotropic dielectric material is an example for such a particle @xcite .",
    "an example of a structure made of such particles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1ba]a .",
    "formally , this structure resides in the * p1m1 * group ( or in * p1 * group if the particles in the a lower chain are rotated by an angle smaller than @xmath85 ) .",
    "however , since the polarizabilities are isotropic , this asymmetry will not show up in the particle - dipole model , and the corresponding dispersion is even also under magnetization .",
    "it should be emphasized that the theoretical analysis above relate only to the particle s polarizabilities , as seen in e.g.  eq .",

    "particle structures _ may _ possess `` hidden '' symmetries that take effect only when the particles are small , and disappear when considering larger particles or continuous medium . furthermore",
    ", the ability to assign `` point - wise '' rotation to a particle whose polarizability is non - isotropic ( e.g. ellipsoids ) , adds degrees of freedom not available in continuous medium or in 1d photonic structure such as the one studied e.g. in @xcite .",
    "all the structures in the examples below consist of plasmonic particles , exposed to a uniform transverse magnetization bias @xmath17 . generally , the single particle polarizability under magnetization can be found , e.g.  in @xcite for metal particles of ellipsoidal shape , and in @xcite for engineered graphene particles using more detailed quantum model based on the kubo theory @xcite .",
    "we note that the latter possesses quasi - static resonance very similar to that of the drude model , with resonant frequency whose role is similar to that of @xmath86 in metals , but in the 40 - 50 thz frequencies . for all particles",
