    "as the end products of about 97% of the stars of the galaxy , white dwarf stars offer important clues about their prior evolutionary history .",
    "they also provide potentially the age of the galactic disk and of the globular clusters they belong to ( winget et al . 1987 ; harris et al .",
    "2006 ) through the age that can be estimated from cooling sequences ( ruiz & bergeron 2001 ) .",
    "however , determining the age of a white dwarf on its cooling sequence requires knowing its fundamental parameters : the total mass , the effective temperature , the luminosity , the fractional mass of the hydrogen and/or the helium outer layers , the core composition , etc .",
    "asteroseismology of white dwarfs provides a unique tool to explore their internal structure and determine those fundamental parameters .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to the pulsating pre - white dwarf stars of pg  1159 type , the gw vir stars , e.g. the prototype of the group pg  1159 - 035 ( winget et al .",
    "1991 ) , the hottest one rxj  2117 + 3412 ( vauclair et al .",
    "2002 ) and the coolest one pg  0122 + 200 ( fu et al .",
    "2007 , crsico et al . 2007 ) , to the db pulsators , e.g. gd  358 ( winget et al .",
    "1994 , provencal et al . 2009 ) , pg  1351 + 489 ( redaelli et al . 2011 ) , and to the dav stars , either for individual pulsator , e.g. hl  tau  76 ( dolez et al . 2006 ) or for global study of the group properties ( castanheira & kepler 2009 ; romero et al .",
    "2012 ) .    since @xmath7 80% of the white dwarf stars are of da type , the uncertainties on their fundamental parameters have a strong impact on the derived age estimates .",
    "this justifies the effort in determining precise fundamental parameters of da white dwarfs using asteroseimology of the da pulsators , the dav or zz ceti stars .",
    "there are presently 148 pulsating da white dwarfs known ( castanheira et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ) .",
    "these stars define a narrow instability strip in the h - r diagram ( or in the log@xmath0-t@xmath8 diagram ) .",
    "this instability strip is a  pure \" instability strip , which means that all the da white dwarfs falling in this domain of the log@xmath0-t@xmath8 diagram do pulsate ( gianninas et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this is an indication that the internal structure of the zz ceti white dwarfs as derived from asteroseismology is representative of the da white dwarfs as a whole group .",
    "white dwarf stars being the oldest stars in a given stellar population , they can be used to estimate the age of the population they belong to . however , to achieve such a goal one must rely on realistic models of white dwarf stars . the major uncertainties in building such realistic models come from the uncertainty on their total mass and on their hydrogen mass fraction as well as from the approximate treatment of the convection by the mixing length theory parameterized by a mixing length @xmath9 . the asteroseismology is the only method able to determine the value of the hydrogen mass fraction and to give accurate total mass estimates of the zz ceti white dwarfs .",
    "in addition , new theoretical developments on the interaction of the pulsations with convection have opened a way to constrain the efficiency of the convection in white dwarf stars ( wu 2001 , montgomery 2005 , montgomery et al .",
    "2010 ) .    the difficulty in determining the fundamental parameters of the zz ceti stars from asteroseismology comes from two main sources : 1 ) the zz ceti stars show generally few modes simultaneously , in contrast with the theoretical calculations which predict much more unstable modes than observed , and 2 ) the pulsation amplitudes become increasingly variable as the zz cetis evolve towards the red edge of the instability strip .",
    "both effects make difficult to find enough appropriate modes to use the method based on the period spacing which needs a large enough number of pulsation modes to be observed and identified . only zz ceti stars close to the blue edge of the instability strip show constant pulsation amplitude .",
    "but in this case , very few modes are unstable since the stars are just entering the instability strip . in those stars ,",
    "the @xmath10-mechanism due to hydrogen partial ionization is responsible for the instability since the fraction of the flux conveyed by convection is negligible ( dolez & vauclair 1981 , winget et al .",
    "as the white dwarfs evolve along their cooling sequence , the fraction of the flux conveyed by convection increases .",
    "the light curves become more complex as a result of the interaction of the convection with the pulsations .",
    "they show signatures of nonlinear effects like non sinusoidal pulse shapes which reflect into linear combinations of  real \" frequencies in the fourier spectrum .",
    "modeling precisely the light curve resulting from these inteactions can be used to constrain the efficiency of convection ( montgomery 2005 , montgomery et al .",
    "the asteroseismological analysis of various zz ceti stars through the instability strip allows to map the convection efficiency .",
    "the da white dwarf hs  0507 + 0434b is one of those zz ceti star of particular interest which we intend to study in more details .",
    "its parameters as derived from earlier spectroscopy give an effective temperature of 11630@xmath11 k and log@xmath0= 8.17@xmath12 ( fontaine et al .",
    "2003 ; bergeron et al .",
    "2004 ) which placed hs  0507 + 0434b approximately in the middle of the instability strip of the zz ceti pulsators .",
    "fontaine et al . (",
    "2003 ) provide a mass value of 0.71  @xmath13 derived from the models of wood ( 1995 ) for carbon core compositions , helium layers of @xmath14 , and hydrogen layers of @xmath15 , and absolute magnitude in @xmath16 of @xmath17 .",
    "more recent high signal / noise ratio spectroscopy and atmospheric analysis by gianninas et al . (",
    "2011 ) have shifted the zz ceti instability strip to higher effective temperature . with an effective temperature and a surface gravity of 12290 @xmath18 k and log@xmath0= 8.24@xmath12 respectively ,",
    "hs 0507 + 0434b still lies close to the middle of the new zz ceti instability strip .",
    "it is of particular interest because it forms a common proper motion pair with hs  0507 + 0434a , which is a 20000 k da white dwarf ( jordan et al .",
    "gianninas et al .",
    "( 2011 ) give also a higher effective temperature of 21550 @xmath19 k for the a component .",
    "since both members of the pair must have been formed at the same time , this provides one additional constraint on the modeling of their evolution .",
    "hs  0507 + 0434b was discovered to be a zz ceti variable by jordan et al .",
    "it has been observed subsequently from single sites only ( kotak et al .",
    "2002 ; handler et al .",
    "those observations allowed the detection of 10 independent frequencies identified as @xmath20=1 gravity modes and of 38 linear combinations of these frequencies ( handler et al .",
    "the linear combinations of frequencies were interpreted as resulting from the nonlinear interaction of the pulsations with convection .",
    "the 10 independent frequencies are formed of three triplets ( i.e. @xmath20=1 modes split by rotation ) plus one single mode .",
    "this was clearly insufficient to constrain the star internal structure .",
    "to improve this situation , we carried out multisite observation campaigns in 2007 , december 2009 and january 2010 to study hs  0507 + 0434b .",
    "the goal of this paper is to improve the determination of the fundamental parameters of hs  0507 + 0434b using the new data collected during the campaigns of 2007 , 2009 and 2010 .",
    "it is organized as follows : the observations are described in @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 analyses the derived amplitude spectrum .",
    "a preliminary asteroseismology of hs  0507 + 0434b is presented in @xmath23 where are discussed successively the frequency identification and their linear combinations , in 4.1 , the period distribution and the period spacing , in 4.2 , the rotational splitting and the rate of rotation , in 4.3 , the inclination of the rotation axis , in 4.4 , and the mode trapping in 4.5 .",
    "@xmath24 discusses the amplitude variations . from the improved list of pulsation modes resulting from this work , we attempt to constrain the fundamental parameters of hs  0507 + 0434b by building a set of models which are described in @xmath25 , from which we derived one `` best fit '' model .",
    "we summarize our results in the conclusions @xmath26 .",
    "hs  0507 + 0434b was observed during a one week multisite campaign in december 2007 , involving the 2.16-m telescope of the national astronomical observatories of china ( naoc ) in xinglong ( xl ) , the 1.8-m telescope of bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) of korea and the 1-m telescope of piszkstet observatory ( po ) of hungary .",
    "later on , a four - week multisite run was carried out from december 2009 to january 2010 with the 2.16-m telescope in xl , the 2.4-m telescope of yunnan astronomical observatory of china in lijiang ( lj ) and the 1.5-m telescope of san pedro mrtir observatory of mexico ( spm ) .",

    "an observing cycle of 30 seconds was used with the ccd cameras in boao and po , while a three - channel photoelectric photometer ( pmt ) was used to observe a comparison star , the sky background , and the target simultaneously with the exposure time of 1 second in xl .",
    "these pmt data points were then summed to a similar sampling rate of 30 seconds . in 2009 and 2010 ,",
    "ccd cameras were used for all runs with an observing cycle of approximately 30 seconds .",

    "the pmt data were reduced as described in pfeiffer et al .",
    "unfortunately the weather conditions were poor at piszkstet observatory during the campaign in 2007 , so these data were not included in the final light curves of the year .",
    "the data collected in both boao and xl in december 8 and 11 overlapped partially each other . as they were obtained through different filters , johnson @xmath29 for boao and white light for xl ,",
    "the overlapping data were used to calculate the amplitude ratio obtained between the two time - series .",
    "then , the magnitudes of the light curves from xl were calibrated to those in the filter @xmath29 .",
    "hence , data from the two sites were able to be combined together for frequency analysis .",

    "for the peaks extracted , we followed the criterion of breger et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and kuschnig et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to take the peaks whose signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios are higher than 4.0 .",

    "3 shows the fts of the light curves of the four individual weeks ( namely week1 , week2 , week3 , and week4 , respectively ) .",
    "we discuss those amplitude variations in more details in @xmath24 .",
    "to extract the frequency values from the ft of the combined light curves from december of 2009 to january of 2010 , we made an analysis similar to the one used to analyse the light curves of 2007 .",
    "however , since the amplitude of a given peak is varying from week to week , prewhitenning of each of the peak by one frequency with a unique fitted amplitude and phase does not allow to completely remove that sinusoidal function for all the four weeks of light curves .",
    "the existence of a residual of the prewhitenning by a sinusoidal function creates a secondary peak whose frequency value is very close to that of the resolved frequency with a lower amplitude . in order to make complete prewhitenning , we optimized the amplitude of each frequency for individual weeks of light curves and then prewhitenned the corresponding sinusoidal functions with varying amplitude values .",
    "this process helps us to extract 33 frequencies , that are listed in the third column of table  3 while the fourth column gives the average amplitude values .",
    "the ft of the residuals after prewhitenning by the 33 frequencies is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "we used the same selection criterion of s / n ratios higher than 4.0 as for the analysis of the 2007 data .",
    "as the uncertainties derived by period04 estimate the internal consistency of the solutions , they are believed to be underestimated .",

    ", we extracted a number of frequencies @xmath32 and the corresponding amplitudes @xmath33 and phases @xmath34 with the software period04 , so the residual time - series @xmath35 were obtained by subtracting the sum of multiple sine functions from the observed time - series as    @xmath36    then @xmath37 is regarded as the observation error of @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we constructed 50 simulated time - series @xmath39 for each observed time - series , by taking @xmath39 as a normally distributed random variable with mean @xmath38 and standard variation @xmath40 .",
    "the 50 simulated time - series were fitted with the sum of multiple sine functions by taking @xmath41 as initial values according to least - squares algorithm .",

    "we define them as the uncertainty estimate of the parameters and include those of frequencies and amplitudes in table  3 .",
    "we compared the uncertainties derived from monte - carlo simulations with those derived from period04 in order to estimate by how much period04 underestimates those uncertainties .",
    "for the 2007 data set , the average uncertainties on the frequencies and on the amplitudes derived from our monte - carlo simulations are 70% larger than those estimated from period04 . for the 2009 - 2010 data sets",

    "is not simply related to its linear growth - rate .",
    "so the amplitude of the trapped mode could have been lower than the detection limit during our observing runs . the observed period at 445  s corresponds to the order @xmath51=5 next to the trapped mode .",

    "the observed trapped or `` almost - trapped '' modes are in better agreement with the modes computed in model 4 and 5 and the global fit estimated from our inverse @xmath50 selects the model 4 as the best - fit model .",
    "this discussion illustrates how sensitive the result is on the number of observed and identified modes . in the data sets presented here , the triplet at 698  s seen in the 2007 data is not present in the 2009 - 2010 data .",

    "this justifies the need for a follow up of this zz ceti star in order to find more modes to better constrain the model and conclude unambiguously about the `` thick '' versus `` thin '' hydrogen content of that star .",
    "however , there are also other arguments in favor of hs  0507 + 0434b having a `` thin '' hydrogen layer .",
    "hs  0507 + 0434a+b form a common proper motion system .",
    "both their similar distance , 49 pc and 48 pc respectively ( gianninas et al .",
    "2011 ) and their similar radial velocity , within their uncertainties ( maxted et al .",
    "2000 , their table 9 ) , confirm that the two stars have been formed together at the same time .",
    "however , in spite of their similar mass ( m@xmath2/m@xmath3=0.67 for the a component according to gianninas et al . and m@xmath2/m@xmath3=0.675 for the b component from our asteroseismic determination ) ,",
    "they show significantly different effective temperature : the component a having 21550 k while the component b , within the same time scale , has cooled to 12290 k ( gianninas et al .",
    "this suggests that hs  0507 + 0434b should have a thinner hydrogen layer than its companion hs  0507 + 0434a .",
    "coming back to the periods at 301.3  s , 247.4  s and 197.7s which we find to fit well the period distribution with the average period spacing of 49.63  s , as discussed in @xmath53 , we checked that neither of the 247.4  s and 197.7s periods could correspond to genuine @xmath1=1 modes since , at least in our claimed `` best - fit model '' , the fundamental @xmath1 = 1 ; @xmath51 = 1 mode has a period of 271.7  s. however , we will discuss below the case of the 197.7s as a possible @xmath1=2 mode .",

    "the observed modes correspond to rather low order @xmath51 , between 3 and 10 for the @xmath1=1 modes .",
    "it means that the hs  0507 + 0434b pulsation spectrum is not entirely in the asymptotic regime .",
    "the period distribution does not follow exactly the regular period spacing expected in the asymptotic regime .",
    "this explains that while the `` trapped modes '' are separated by @xmath60k= 5 in table 5 it is @xmath60k=4 in table 8 .",

    "- from the frequency shifts measured in the triplets , we determine an average rotational splitting of 3.59  @xmath610.57  @xmath27hz from which we infer an average rotation rate of 1.61  @xmath610.26  days .",
    "the amplitude ratio of the triplets components , if interpreted as uniquely due to geometrical effect , could be used to estimate that the angle of the rotation axis on the line of sight is close to @xmath62 .",
    "however , the evidence of amplitude variations casts some doubts on the assumption that only geometrical aspect is responsible for the amplitude ratios .",
    "- the amplitude of the modes vary on week time - scale and we find that the `` pulsation power '' is also time dependent .",
    "- we computed a grid of models and their @xmath1=1 @xmath0-modes in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the comparison of their theoretical periods with the observed periods through @xmath50 tests allows us to estimate the fundamental parameters of a preliminary `` best fit '' model which has a total mass of m@xmath2/m@xmath3 = 0.675 , a luminosity l / l@xmath3=3.5@xmath4 , a thin hydrogen outer layer of m@xmath5/m@xmath2= 10@xmath6 .",
    "the periods of other models with `` thick '' hydrogen envelope do not fit as well the observed periods according to their @xmath50 .",
    "the `` thin '' hydrogen envelope of the best fit model of hs  0507 + 0434b is in agreement with the fact that its common proper motion companion hs  0507 + 0434a , which must have been formed at the same time and has a similar mass , has a significantly higher effective temperature .",
    "this implies that the b component must have a thinner h envelope than the a component for having cooled down to a lower effective temperature during the same cooling time scale .",
    "this low value of the hydrogen mass fraction suggests that hs  0507 + 0434b has evolved from a last he thermal pulse episode .",
    "further observations of hs  0507 + 0434b are required to refine the modeling , to better constrain the amplitude variation time - scales and identify the physical mechanism driving those variations , and to contribute to the mapping of the convection efficiency through the zz ceti instability strip .",
