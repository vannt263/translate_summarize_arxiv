    "we are concerned about population synchronization of bursting neurons .",
    "bursting occurs when neuronal activity alternates , on a slow timescale , between a silent phase and an active ( bursting ) phase of fast repetitive spikings @xcite .",
    "this type of bursting activity occurs due to the interplay of the fast ionic currents leading to spiking activity and the slower currents modulating the spiking activity .",
    "hence , the dynamics of bursting neurons have two timescales : slow bursting timescale and fast spiking timescale .",
    "thanks to a repeated sequence of spikes in the bursting , there are many hypotheses on the importance of bursting activities in the neural information transmission @xcite ; for example , ( a ) bursts are necessary to overcome the synaptic transmission failure , ( b ) bursts are more reliable than single spikes in evoking responses in postsynaptic neurons , and ( c ) bursts can be used for selective communication between neurons .",
    "there are several representative examples of bursting neurons such as intrinsically bursting neurons and chattering neurons in the cortex @xcite , thalamic relay neurons and thalamic reticular neurons in the thalamus @xcite , hippocampal pyramidal neurons @xcite , purkinje cells in the cerebellum @xcite , pancreatic @xmath6-cells @xcite , and respiratory neurons in pre - botzinger complex @xcite .",
    "these bursting neurons exhibit two different patterns of synchronization due to the slow and the fast timescales of bursting activity .",
    "burst synchronization ( synchrony on the slow bursting timescale ) refers to a temporal coherence between the active phase ( bursting ) onset or offset times of bursting neurons , while spike synchronization ( synchrony on the fast spike timescale ) characterizes a temporal coherence between intraburst spikes fired by bursting neurons in their respective active phases @xcite .",
    "for example , large - scale burst synchronization ( called the sleep spindle oscillation of 7 - 14 hz ) has been found to occur via interaction between the excitatory thalamic relay cells and the inhibitory thalamic reticular neurons in the thalamus during the early stage of slow - wave sleep @xcite .",
    "these sleep spindle oscillations are involved in memory consolidation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , this kind of burst synchronization is also correlated with abnormal pathological rhythms associated with neural diseases such as movement disorder ( parkinson s disease and essential tremor ) @xcite and epileptic seizure @xcite .",
    "particularly , for the case of the parkinson s disease hypokinetic motor symptoms ( i.e. , slowness and rigidity of voluntary movement ) are closely related to the burst synchronization occurring in the beta band of 10 - 30 hz range in the basal ganglia , while the hyperkinetic motor symptom ( i.e. , resting tremor ) is associated with the burst synchronization of @xmath7 hz .    in this paper , we study burst and spike synchronization of bursting neurons , associated with neural information processes in health and disease , in complex networks .",
    "synaptic connectivity in brain networks has been found to have complex topology which is neither regular nor completely random @xcite .",
    "particularly , brain networks have been found to exhibit power - law degree distributions ( i.e. , scale - free property ) in the rat hippocampal networks @xcite and the human cortical functional network @xcite .",
    "furthermore , robustness against simulated lesions of mammalian cortical anatomical networks @xcite has also been found to be most similar to that of a scale - free network ( sfn ) @xcite .",
    "this kind of sfns are inhomogeneous ones with a few `` hubs '' ( superconnected nodes ) , in contrast to statistically homogeneous networks such as random graphs and small - world networks @xcite .",
    "many recent works on various subjects of neurodynamics ( e.g. , coupling - induced burst synchronization , delay - induced burst synchronization , and suppression of burst synchronization ) have been done in sfns with a few percent of hub neurons with an exceptionally large number of connections @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of our study is to investigate the effect of scale - free connectivity on emergence of burst and spike synchronization in a directed sfn of bursting neurons , evolved via two independent local @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes which occur with probabilities @xmath8 and @xmath6 ( @xmath9 ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath8-process corresponds to a directed version of the standard barabsi - albert sfn model ( i.e. , growth and preferential directed attachment ) @xcite . on the other hand , for the @xmath6-process only preferential attachments between pre - existing nodes",
    "are made without addition of new nodes ( i.e. , no growth ) @xcite .",
    "consequently , degrees of pre - existing nodes are intensified via the @xmath6-process .",
    "these @xmath8- and @xmath6-processes occur naturally in the evolution of communication networks ( e.g. , world - wide web ) and social networks ( e.g. , collaboration graph of actors or authors ) @xcite .",
    "we expect that in addition to the growing @xmath8-process , incorporation of the @xmath6-process ( intensifying the internal connections between pre - existing nodes ) may be regarded as a natural extension in typical sfns , independently of their specific nature",
    ". for details on the extended models of network evolution , refer to refs .",
    "@xcite where local processes , incorporating addition of new nodes and addition or removal of connections between pre - existing nodes , are discussed . following this line , as our brain network of bursting neurons we employ the sfn model evolved via the @xmath8- and the @xmath6-processes , as in our recent work on sparse synchronization of spiking neurons @xcite . for this case",
    ", we expect that the @xmath8- and the @xmath6-processes might be related to brain plasticity which refers to the brain s ability to change its structure and function by modifying structure and strength of synaptic connections during the development @xcite .",
    "our sfn is composed of suprathreshold hindmarsh - rose ( hr ) neurons .",
    "the hr neurons are representative bursting neurons @xcite , and they interact through inhibitory gabaergic synapses ( involving the @xmath10 receptors ) .",
    "we first consider the case of `` pure '' @xmath8-process ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) with symmetric preferential attachment with the same in- and out - degrees ( @xmath12 ) , and study emergence of burst synchronization and `` complete '' synchronization ( composed of both burst and spike synchronization ) by varying the coupling strength @xmath2 and the noise intensity @xmath3 for a fixed attachment degree @xmath13 .",
    "thus , we obtain a state diagram in the @xmath14 plane where complete synchronization occurs within a part of the region of burst synchronization . for an intensive study we fix the value of @xmath2 , and investigate the evolution of population states by increasing @xmath3 . for small @xmath3 ,",
    "complete synchronization emerges .",
    "however , as @xmath3 passes a lower threshold @xmath15 the intraburst spike synchronization breaks up , and then only the burst synchronization appears .",
    "eventually when passing a higher threshold @xmath16 , a transition to unsynchronization occurs due to a destructive effect of noise to spoil the synchronization .",
    "this type of burst and ( intraburst ) spike synchronization may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which is a collection of spike trains of individual neurons . for the case of burst synchronization ,",
    "synchronous bursting bands appear in the raster plot , and ( intraburst ) spiking stripes also exist within the bursting bands for the case of complete synchronization .",
    "such raster plots of spikes are fundamental data in experimental neuroscience .",
    "then , the instantaneous population firing rate ( ipfr ) @xmath17 which may be directly obtained from the raster plot of spikes is often used as a collective quantity describing the whole population behavior @xcite . through frequency filtering , we separate the slow bursting and the fast ( intraburst ) spiking timescales of the bursting activity for independent characterization of burst and spike synchronization . then , @xmath17 can be decomposed into the instantaneous population burst rate ( ipbr ) @xmath18 and the instantaneous population spike rate ( ipsr ) @xmath19 which describe burst and spike synchronization separately . for more direct visualization of bursting behavior , we also consider another raster plot of bursting onset or offset times . for the case of burst synchronization , synchronous bursting stripes appear in the raster plot .",
    "we note that , from this type of raster plot of bursting onset or offset times , one can directly obtain the ipbr @xmath20 or @xmath21 without frequency filtering . for characterization of burst and ( intraburst )",
    "spike synchronization , we employ realistic order parameters and statistical - mechanical measures , based on the ipbrs [ @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ] and the ipsr [ @xmath19 ] , which were introduced in our recent work @xcite .",
    "then , the higher and the lower thresholds , @xmath24 and @xmath15 , for the bursting and the spiking transitions may be determined in terms of the bursting and the spiking order parameters ( corresponding to the time - averaged fluctuations of the ipbrs and the ipsr ) , respectively . furthermore , in the region of @xmath25 , the degree of burst synchronization seen in the raster plot of bursting onset times may be well measured in terms of a statistical - mechanical bursting measure @xmath26 , introduced by considering both the occupation degree of bursting onset times ( representing the density of bursting stripes ) and their pacing degree ( denoting the smearing of the bursting stripes ) in the raster plot .",
    "similarly , in the region of @xmath27 , the degree of ( intraburst ) spike synchronization may also be measured in terms of a statistical - mechanical spiking measure @xmath28 which is given by the product of the occupation and the pacing degrees of the spiking times in the raster plot .",
    "next , we choose appropriate values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 where only the burst synchronization occurs in the above pure @xmath8-process with symmetric attachment of @xmath29 , and study the effect of the scale - free connectivity on the burst synchronization by varying ( 1 ) the degree @xmath30 of symmetric attachment and ( 2 ) the `` asymmetry '' parameter @xmath31 of asymmetric preferential attachment of new nodes with different in- and out - degrees ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that @xmath34 constant ) .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0process , as the third case of network architecture , we also study the effect of the @xmath6-process ( intensifying the internal links between pre - existing nodes without adding new nodes ) by ( 3 ) increasing the probability @xmath6 . in theses",
    "3 cases of varying @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath6 , we investigate changes in the degree and the type of population synchronization in connection with network topology such as the average path length @xmath4 ( representing typical separation between two nodes in the network ) and the betweenness centralization @xmath5 ( denoting the relative load of communication traffic concentrated to the head hub ) , both of which affect the global communication between nodes , and the in - degree distribution affecting the individual neuronal dynamics ( characterized by the mean bursting / spiking rates ) .",
    "it is thus found that not only @xmath4 and @xmath5 , but also the in - degree distribution are important network factors to determine the pacing degree of population synchronization of bursting neurons in sfns ( i.e. , dispersion of mean bursting / spiking rates of individual neurons as well as effectiveness of global communication between nodes are responsible for the population synchronization ) .",
    "specifically , as @xmath30 is increased from @xmath35 and both @xmath31 and @xmath6 are also increased from 0 , the pacing degree of the burst synchronization increases thanks to the combined effects of the in - degree distribution , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "eventually , when passing their higher thresholds @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , complete synchronization emerges , respectively .",
    "in contrast , with decreasing @xmath30 from @xmath35 and @xmath31 from 0 , the pacing degree of the burst synchronization decreases , and transitions to unsynchronization occur when paasing their lower thresholds @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",

    "<S> we investigate the effect of network architecture on burst and spike synchronization in a directed scale - free network ( sfn ) of bursting neurons , evolved via two independent @xmath0 and @xmath1processes . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0process corresponds to a directed version of the barabsi - albert sfn model with growth and preferential attachment , while for the @xmath1process only preferential attachments between pre - existing nodes are made without addition of new nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the `` pure '' @xmath0process of symmetric preferential attachment ( with the same in- and out - degrees ) , and study emergence of burst and spike synchronization by varying the coupling strength @xmath2 and the noise intensity @xmath3 for a fixed attachment degree . </S>",
    "<S> characterizations of burst and spike synchronization are also made by employing realistic order parameters and statistical - mechanical measures . </S>",
    "<S> next , we choose appropriate values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 where only the burst synchronization occurs , and investigate the effect of the scale - free connectivity on the burst synchronization by varying ( 1 ) the symmetric attachment degree and ( 2 ) the asymmetry parameter ( representing deviation from the symmetric case ) in the @xmath0process , and ( 3 ) the occurrence probability of the @xmath1process . in all these three cases , changes in the type and the degree of population synchronization are studied in connection with the network topology such as the degree distribution , the average path length @xmath4 , and the betweenness centralization @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus found that not only @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( affecting global communication between nodes ) but also the in - degree distribution ( affecting individual dynamics ) are important network factors for effective population synchronization in sfns . </S>"
