    "irrespective of their level of sophistication , infinite nuclear matter ( inm ) calculations provide a relatively low isoscalar effective mass ( iem ) , @xmath10 , at the saturation density  @xcite .",
    "this finding is at variance with empirical data on the level density at the fermi energy in finite nuclei , which are consistent with @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , the level density close to the fermi surface appears to be very well described within simple models using bare nucleonic mass and a phenomenological one - body potential , @xmath12 , of , e.g. , the woods - saxon form  @xcite .",
    "it is not at all obvious , however , whether the success of such non - self - consistent approach is built upon solid theoretical foundations or is a mere effect of the fitting strategy of @xmath12 , which is adjusted precisely to the single - particle ( sp ) spectra .",
    "indeed , rigorous and in principle exact treatment of the single - particle propagator ( green s function ) is obtained within the landau quasi - particle theory by solving the dyson equation , which contains , in general , a spatially non - local and energy ( frequency ) dependent self - energy  @xcite .",
    "hence , from theory point of view , the use of static , momentum and energy ( frequency ) independent mean potentials seems to have no justification at all .",
    "quantitatively , the most important effect on the sp spectra is expected to come from spacial non - locality or momentum dependence of the mean potential .",
    "this effect is naturally taken into account in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation based on effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions , like the most popular skyrme @xcite or gogny @xcite forces .",
    "indeed , the zero - range skyrme ( pseudo- ) potential depends explicitly on momentum . in case of the finite - range gogny interaction ,",
    "the effect enters through the exchange term .",
    "the energy dependence is considered only as a perturbation correction atop of the hf result  @xcite and is usually completely ignored .",
    "the self - consistent hf method involving the skyrme or gogny interactions leads to a non - uniform , position - dependent iem , @xmath13 . due to a rather restricted form of these forces , a typical iem profile changes",
    "smoothly from the bare - mass value of @xmath14 outside the nucleus to the inm value of @xmath1 in the nuclear interior .",
    "this lowers the nuclear level density at the fermi surface usually well below the experimental value and , in turn , spoils the spectroscopic properties of these forces , see  @xcite and references quoted therein .",
    "the contradicting results concerning the sp level density in inm and finite nuclei are related to the fact that in finite nuclei the sp levels couple to low - lying collective surface vibrations , which leads to an increase of the iem at the surface .",
    "several authors argued that this effect can be taken into account within the random phase approximation , i.e. , by going beyond mean field , see  @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint is difficult to reconcile with the density functional theory ( dft ) that should warrant a proper radial dependence of the iem through the fit to empirical data provided that the energy density functional ( edf ) , or the effective nn interaction , is rich enough to accommodate the anticipated increase of the iem in the surface area .",
    "taking into account the particle - vibration coupling may help resolve the discussed controversy in the following way .",
    "the iem is smaller than one inside the nucleus , as required for nuclear matter . on the other hand ,",
    "it is peaked up at the surface , so that it may give one when averaged over the nuclear volume .",
    "this may allow to simultaneously reproduce the level density in finite nuclei .",
    "the surface - peaked iem was first explored by ma and wambach . in their seminal paper",
    "@xcite , they used a phenomenological one - body hamiltonian ,",
    "@xmath15 consisting of the woods - saxon potential with the spin - orbit ( so ) term , @xmath16 , and the kinetic term with a radius - dependent iem taken as follows , @xmath17 and depending on two adjustable constants , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . the function @xmath20 is related to unperturbed self - energy , @xmath21 it mimics the radial dependence of the sp potential and was chosen so that @xmath22 .",
    "it essentially follows the profile of the nucleonic density , @xmath23 .",
    "ma and wambach demonstrated that one can indeed unify the description of the sp levels in inm and finite nuclei by taking @xmath24 in the bulk and peaking it up at the nuclear surface to @xmath25 , depending on the nucleus .",
    "this result was later confirmed by farine  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to hold in self - consistent hf calculations .",
    "the aim of the present work is to explore the iem modifications caused by the spacial non - locality of the nn interaction and by the particle - vibration coupling within a fully self - consistent model . unlike farine",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who obtained a surface - peaked iem by adding new terms to the skyrme interaction , we approach the problem from the perspective of the dft , taking as a starting point the local skyrme functional and adding new terms thereto .",
    "nowadays , the nuclear edfs are treated as basic entities , independent of the nn interaction . in this sense ,",
    "our approach is more general and more flexible than the skyrme hf theory .    in this exploratory work ,",
    "we extend the skyrme functional by adding two terms , which are described in detail in sect .",
    "[ terms ] . their effect on the radial iem profile",
    "is presented in sect .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "all considerations presented in this work concern the isoscalar effective mass , and are limited to doubly - magic @xmath26 nuclei .",
    "such nuclei are spherical , which further simplifies the calculations .",
    "the local skyrme edf , @xmath27 , consists of the kinetic and potential parts , @xmath28 for even - even nuclei , @xmath29 \\rho^2_t + c^{\\delta \\rho}_t\\rho_t\\delta\\rho_t + \\\\ \\nonumber & \\quad & c^{\\tau}_t\\rho_t\\tau_t+c^j_t { \\mathbb j}^2_t+c^{\\nabla j}_t \\rho_t { \\mathbf \\nabla}\\cdot{\\mathbf   j}_t .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] index @xmath30 denotes isospin , and @xmath31 are adjustable coupling constants .",
    "the constant @xmath32 $ ] is density - dependent and equals @xmath32=c^{\\rho\\,\\prime}_t+c^{\\rho\\,\\prime\\prime}_t ( \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_{0,eq}})^{\\alpha}$ ] , where @xmath33 is the inm saturation density .",
    "the potential energy terms are bilinear forms of time - even particle , kinetic , and tensor densities , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and their derivatives .",
    "the density @xmath37 is the vector part of the spin - current tensor , @xmath38 .",
    "since we consider @xmath26 nuclei , only the isoscalar ( @xmath39 ) channel is active .",
    "readers interested in details are referred , e.g. , to ref .",
    "@xcite .    within this formalism",
    ", the iem comes from variation of @xmath40 over @xmath41 , @xmath42 thus , @xmath13 depends on the particle density .",
    "it is equal to one outside the nucleus and , for positive values of @xmath43 , smaller than one in the bulk .",
    "therefore , the conventional skyrme edf contains only the volume term @xmath44 of parametrization ( [ ma_em ] ) .    in order to allow for a surface - peaked profile of the iem one has to add new terms to the functional . having an almost complete liberty in choosing their form",
    ", we decided to add either the term @xmath45 or @xmath46 we call these two variants of the model a and b , and explore them separately , never including both terms simultaneously .",
    "the rationale behind these two choices is almost self - evident .",
    "both terms are proportional to the kinetic density , @xmath41 , and to derivatives of the particle density , @xmath47 .",
    "hence , their variations give @xmath48 and @xmath49 for variants a and b , respectively .",
    "they modify the skyrme value ( [ m - sky ] ) at the nuclear surface , where the derivative of the particle density is large , and give small contributions elsewhere .",
    "since the density gradient is negative in the surface region , while its square is positive , the peak is obtained for negative values of @xmath50 in variant a , and for positive values of @xmath51 in variant b.    the new terms also contribute to the mean potential according to the formula @xmath52 this contribution is included self - consistently in our calculations .",
    "the term a is a scalar , so its form is natural even if spherical symmetry is not assumed .",
    "the use of term b is restricted to nuclei of spherical shapes , what seems to be a disadvantage .",
    "we have decided to explore this term mainly because it mimics closely bulk and surface terms @xmath53 of the ma and wambach parametrization ( [ ma_em ] ) .",
    "the new terms introduced here are of completely different nature than those used by farine  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the iem is modified not by the gradient of the density , but through its value , @xmath54 where @xmath19 is a new parameter .",
    "in such an approach , the peak at the surface is not due to the slope of the density , but because the density there equals approximately half of its value in the interior .    in a preliminary study  @xcite ,",
    "we also investigated two other terms , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these , however , do not provide the expected radial profile of the iem , and are not considered here .",
    "we base all our calculations on the skxc skyrme parametrization of ref .",
    "this force was designed with particular attention to describe the sp levels , and has the iem close to unity right from the beginning .",
    "we add our new terms to the skxc functional , and vary some of its coupling constants as described below .",
    "we perform the calculations for three doubly - magic , @xmath26 , spherical nuclei , @xmath9ca , @xmath57ni , and @xmath58sn .",
    "as already explained , we aim at obtaining an iem profile which provides @xmath59 lower than one inside the nucleus and peaked at the surface , so that its mean value is close to one . in order to fulfill the latter condition",
    "we require that @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass number .",
    "a similar constraint was used by ma and wambach . note that while the new coupling constants , @xmath62 and @xmath51 , are responsible for the peak , @xmath63 accounts for lowering the iem inside the nucleus .",
    "thus , the condition ( [ m - unit ] ) can be satisfied by an appropriate balance between the new coupling constants and @xmath63 .",
    "we proceed with the calculations for each of the considered nuclei separately in the following way . in both variants , we scan a range of the appropriate new coupling constant , and , for each value thereof , we readjust @xmath63 to fulfill the constraint ( [ m - unit ] ) , keeping all the remaining coupling constants frozen at their skxc values .    .limiting values of the new coupling constants corresponding to the largest peak and anti - peak in @xmath9ca .

    "the solid ( dashed ) lines show the iem profiles with the largest peak ( anti - peak ) , obtained for the limiting values of the new coupling constants shown in table [ table].,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for completeness , we examine both positive and negative values of each new coupling constant , which corresponds both to a peak and to an anti - peak at the surface .",
    "it turns out that the range of each new constant is limited in both directions . beyond that range , rapid oscillations in the density",
    "occur , and the hf iterations diverge .",
    "the limiting values of the coupling constants give rise to the largest peak or anti - peak that could be obtained . as an example , we give those limiting values for @xmath9ca in table [ table ] , and show the corresponding iem profiles in fig .  [ shapes ] .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ shapes ] that both variants of our model are rich enough to render a surface - peaked iem .",
    "however , the height of the peak is rather limited . in variant",
    "a , the iem in the nuclear interior is larger than @xmath650.9 and reaches only @xmath651.10 at the surface .",
    "these values equal @xmath650.8 and @xmath651.25 for variant b , respectively . for the same nucleus ,",
    "ma and wambach quote the values of @xmath650.7 and @xmath651.25 .",
    "this result can be reproduced only in variant b of our model .",
    "it should also be mentioned that we failed to obtain a surface - peaked iem with those skyrme parametrizations which have a small effective mass in the inm limit , like @xmath66 .",
    "we are now in a position to examine the influence of the new terms on sp spectra .",

    "@xcite . to focus attention ,",
    "we discuss only the neutron splittings and centroids .",
    "let us remind that within the dft formalism , the so splittings are determined by the so field , @xmath70 , which is a derivative of @xmath40 over @xmath71 , and , for spherical symmetry , equals @xmath72 where @xmath73 stands for radial component of the vector part of the spin - current @xmath74 . since in most skyrme parametrizations , including skxc , the tensor coupling constant , @xmath75 , is very small or zero , the so field is in practice proportional to the gradient of the density , which is largest at the surface .",

    "it turns out that even the largest possible peak only weakly affects the density profile in the surface region , but quite strongly amplifies the density fluctuations inside the nucleus .",

    "[ den_tdr ] .",
    "with increasing @xmath51 , the density drops in the nuclear interior and the surface of the nucleus moves outward .",
    "hence , also the gradient of the density and the so field are repelled from the bulk , where the wave functions are located , and the so splittings decrease .",
    "this argument is stronger for high@xmath89 , @xmath84 orbits with an appreciable amount of the wave function in the surface region , and much weaker for low@xmath89 , @xmath76 orbits , whose wave functions have one node inside the nucleus .",
    "the centroids move up in energy because the potential well becomes shallower and wider .          in the _ perturbative _ calculations ,",
    "the new terms deteriorate the performance of the skxc functional concerning the inm saturation energy , binding energy per nucleon , and the incompressibility modulus , as well as radii , binding energies , and sp levels in finite nuclei .",
    "the influence on the inm properties is illustrated in fig .",
    "this is so because the _ perturbative _ calculations take some coupling constants too far away from the skxc values without readjusting the remaining ones .",
    "hence , although helpful in understanding the response of the nucleus against the new terms , these calculations are of limited applicability . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to remove this drawback by refitting some other skyrme coupling constants to selected radii , masses , and sp levels in finite nuclei .",

    "such a profile accounts for coupling of single - particle ( sp ) states to low - lying surface vibrations , and it may allow for a correct description of sp level density close to the fermi surface both in infinite nuclear matter ( inm ) and in finite nuclei .",
    "it was demonstrated that both terms do indeed produce a peak in the iem , but of a limited height , because too large values of the new coupling constants lead to an instability and divergence of the hf iterations .",
    "it turned out that the response of the sp levels to the presence of the peak strongly depends on the variant of the model .",

    "thus , the inclusion of the new terms may help reproduce the empirical so splittings .",
    "it may also be helpful in determining the correct strength of the tensor term , which is also partially responsible for the so properties .",
    "finally , the onset of the peak in variant b reduces the energy distance between the _ pseudo - spin _ partners in @xmath9ca , which also improves the agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "rigorous fits to bulk and sp data are necessary to corroborate or falsify our findings .",
