    "k+a galaxies , also known as post - starburst galaxies ( psg ) , show spectra of a strong balmer absorption series superposed over a k - giant dominated spectrum typical of early - type galaxies , implying the recent termination ( @xmath9 gyr ) of a significant episode of star formation in an otherwise quiescent stellar population @xcite",
    ". these objects may be the best examples of galaxies transitioning from the ` blue cloud ' ( of star - forming objects ) to the ` red sequence ' , and have often been identified as possible progenitors of the lenticular population in clusters @xcite , rejuvenated early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the descendants of the blue galaxies observed in intermediate redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "the mechanism by which star formation is initiated and/or quenched in these galaxies is still unclear .",
    "the majority of local k+a galaxies lie in the general field rather than clusters @xcite and the processes that trigger and halt star formation may differ in these environments . at the same time , in the intermediate redshift clusters where k+a galaxies were originally discovered , a significant fraction of current star formation is obscured by dust @xcite .",
    "dusty starbursts tend to have strong balmer absorption but only weak oii emission as the young stars and hii regions that produce the emission lines tend to lie in regions of high extinction while the longer lived a - stars can migrate out of their native molecular cloud : this would be a viable model to explain the k+a spectral class @xcite .",
    "therefore it is still unclear whether k+a galaxies are truly `` red and dead , '' although the 24@xmath1 m observations of @xcite in abell 851 imply that star formation has largely ceased in these objects .",
    "obscured star formation may also be detected via radio emission at 20 cm ( 1.4 ghz ) , which is produced by synchrotron radiation from high energy cosmic rays originating in supernova shells and yields a measure of the massive star formation rate @xcite .",
    "although @xcite found evidence of recent star formation in 5 k+a galaxies , other studies find little evidence of ongoing star formation within small samples @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that most k+a have substantial gas reservoirs , similar to those of spirals of the same luminosity , and suggest that k+a galaxies may be observed during a hiatus in an episodic star formation history or that current star formation may be obscured .    in this _",
    "letter _ we use a stack of radio images to further test the current star formation rate and/or agn activity in spectroscopically selected k+a galaxies . a description of the data and the analysis is provided in the next section , while we interpret and discuss our results in section 3 .",
    "we adopt the latest wmap cosmological parameters with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and h@xmath12 km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 .",
    "we select a sample of 811 k+a galaxies from the data release 7 of the sdss @xcite using an updated catalog of @xcite . only objects classified as galaxies with a spectroscopic signal - to - noise @xmath13 per pixel",
    "are considered .",
    "the selection criteria of k+a galaxies are equivalent widths of h@xmath14  , h@xmath15    and [ oii ] @xmath16  , where emission lines are negative .",
    "galaxies of redshift @xmath17 are excluded from the sample due to the @xmath18  sky feature .",
    "the selected sample of k+a galaxies have redshifts ranging @xmath19 .",
    "we then use data from the first survey @xcite to derive a mean radio image of k+a galaxies .",
    "typical detection limits for a single first image are @xmath61 mjy , which , for the mean redshift from our sdss dr7 sample of k+a galaxies , would only allow us to detect star formation rates in excess of 30 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .    for each of the 811 k+a galaxies covered by the survey we cut out a @xmath20 square from the first database .",
    "we use the median stacking method of @xcite to create the resulting image of 811 k+a galaxies shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ stackedfits ] .",
    "we then measure the flux from the combined image in an aperture equivalent to three first beams from which we derive an average k+a flux of @xmath21 @xmath1jy .        to assess the significance of this result",
    ", we need to estimate the level of noise in the image . as first is a survey ,",
    "the image cutouts may not be fully cleaned of artifacts , such as side - lobes from distant radio sources . to do this",
    ", we use a monte carlo simulation with a sample of known radio - quiet objects , 8495 white dwarfs from the sdss @xcite .",
    "we create 10,000 stacks of 811 randomly selected white dwarfs ( equivalent to the stack of k+a galaxies ) and measure the flux in the same fashion to derive the mean flux from a supposedly radio - quiet sample .",
    "this procedure allows us to estimate the level of noise present in the stacked image and therefore to determine the significance of our detection for k+a galaxies .",
    "a histogram of the fluxes from our monte carlo simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ wdhist ] .",
    "since we know that these sources are radio quiet , we can estimate a @xmath7 significance flux for sources to be considered real .",
    "we find this flux to be @xmath22  @xmath1jy .",

    "we assume that the radio emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation such that @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this yields our measurement of radio power , which we can convert to a sfr using @xmath30 from @xcite , which assumes a salpeter initial mass function between 0.1 and 100 solar masses .",
    "this yields a star formation rate of @xmath31 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 for our average k+a galaxy at @xmath32 .",
    "however 79 of our sources are measured to have 1.4 ghz fluxes above the 3@xmath2 noise level of the first survey .",
    "the first beam has an rms of 0.15 mjy and we find 79 galaxies ( @xmath610% ) have aperture fluxes in excess of 3@xmath2 ( 450 @xmath1jy ) within an aperture of 3 beamsizes , 31 of which have fluxes in excess of 5@xmath2 ( 750 @xmath1jy ) .    in fig .",
    "[ luminosityz ] we show the redshift  luminosity distribution of the targets with aperture fluxes above the @xmath33 and @xmath7 limits . visual inspection of these individual outlier frames have shown that for the 31 galaxies above the 5@xmath2 limit , about 80% look like clear individual detections ( i.e. , centrally concentrated , likely to be associated with our optical target , not in a frame that is significantly noisy ) , while for the 48 that are above the 3@xmath2 limit but less than the 5@xmath2 limit , only about 10% of these are clear detections .",
    "overall only about 4% of our sample of 811 galaxies show evidence of significant ongoing radio activity , either from star formation or agn activity .     and 5@xmath2 as green squares and red circles , respectively .",

    "we can place an upper limit on the sfr of @xmath34  m@xmath4  yr@xmath5 for this subsample with @xmath35 .",
    "when star formation ceases in a galaxy , we expect it to decrease exponentially to low levels , rather than an abrupt truncation , unless some ` catastrophic ' event has removed all the available fuel or ionized the gas and prevented further star formation .",
    "evidence for a rapid shutdown of star formation in these galaxies has been presented by @xcite .",
    "we therefore carry out the same analysis on a subsample of ` young ' k+a galaxies and attempt to detect residual star formation in these objects .    in fig .",
    "[ ageplot ] , we plot h@xmath36 and d4000 from sdss spectra and overplot models calculated with galaxev @xcite .",
    "we plot the galaxies with significant 1.4 ghz detections as red squares , the rest as gray dots .",
    "we adopt a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) and solar metallicity as initial conditions .",
    "the model galaxies evolved over 10 gyr with an exponentially decreasing star formation rate ( @xmath37 = 1 gyr ) . at 10 gyr",
    ", we added an instantaneous starburst ( delta function ) of mass 1 , 5 , 10 , 30 and 50% ( relative to the old stellar population ) after which the sfr returns to zero . the dotted lines demarcate the values of the spectral indices observed 30 , 50 , 100 , 250 and 500 myr after the burst .",
    "these are the same models used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then select the 456 k+a galaxies with burst ages less than 250 myr and an average redshift of @xmath38 and stack these galaxies in the same fashion as the complete sample .",
    "the stacked image is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ stackedfits ] from which we measure a mean flux of 61  @xmath1jy .",
    "the monte carlo simulation with white dwarfs gives a 5@xmath2 detection limit of 59  @xmath1jy .",
    "our younger sample of k+a galaxies is found to be at the @xmath7 detection limit , giving a sfr of @xmath39  m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with a rapid decline of star formation in these galaxies as shown by @xcite .",
    "we have found an average star formation rate of only @xmath40  m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 from stacking radio observations of 811 _ general field _",
    "k+a galaxies in the local universe .    however , much of this signal appears to originate from @xmath64% of active galaxies .",
    "based on the definition of @xcite , which requires radio power above @xmath41 w hz@xmath5 and the absence of emission lines , this sample is approximately equally split between star forming galaxies and agn ( with the latter more prominent at higher redshifts because of selection effects ) .    for the remainder of the sample , we find an upper limit on the sfr of 1.4 m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "even a subsample of spectroscopically young galaxies does not show a significant detection of residual star formation .",
    "our results are in good agreement with previous work .",
    "@xcite did not detect evidence of star formation from vla observations in 36 galaxies drawn from the sdss dr1 @xcite but he was able to set an upper limit of @xmath42 m@xmath43 yr@xmath5 for 15 of the nearest k+a galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that only 2 out of 15 k+a galaxies in his sample show signs of obscured star formation .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite find that most k+a galaxies in this sample exhibit significant excess above the predicted stellar component at @xmath44 @xmath1 m from wise data , suggesting that dust heated by some unknown source is present in these objects .",
    "@xcite pointed out that k+a galaxies contain significant amounts of gas and therefore the current quiescent star formation may only be temporary , while @xcite proposed a model where star formation continues in k+a galaxies but is hidden by dust .",
    "however , @xcite detected no 24 @xmath1 m emission for k+a galaxies in abell 851 .    another possible contribution to the radio flux is that k+a galaxies may host an agn .",
    "most k+a galaxies have significant bulges @xcite and therefore should contain a supermassive central black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the general field , k+a galaxies",
    "are often involved in mergers and interactions @xcite and show inverted color gradients indicative of central star formation @xcite , which is expected if mergers drive gas to the center @xcite .",
    "@xcite find evidence of a weak agn in a nearby k+a galaxy .",
    "however , @xcite find only a few agns in a subset of our sample and they argue that these active nuclei are not related to the quenching of the previous starburst .",
    "@xcite argue that agn feedback is only important among the more massive k+a galaxies .",
    "@xcite find no evidence for agn in their sample of cosmos k+a galaxies using deep vla and xmm imaging of the cosmos field and only a small number of star forming objects , in agreement with our results . on the other hand",
    "@xcite argued for a weak correlation between agn and k+a galaxies in the egs field .",
    "@xcite present a model where k+a galaxies originate from gas - rich mergers and the duration of the balmer - line strong phase is shorter than the commonly assumed @xmath61 gyr by about a factor of 3 . in this framework the @xmath64% of ` active ' galaxies that we find may be the tail end of the distribution , while other objects are already heading towards the red sequence . in this case , this might yield a constraint on the activity timescale , assuming a 0.3 gyr duration for the k+a phenomenon .",
    "if the 4% of active galaxies represent the last gasp of activity before the agn returns to a dormant state , the period of visible qso activity may be estimated to be about 20 myr , which is broadly consistent with current estimates ( e.g. , see review by @xcite ) .",
    "another plausible explanation is that we are actually observing galaxies undergoing a series of starbursts and feedback episodes , as in the cycle postulated by @xcite to account for the tightness of the red sequence within a hierarchical formation framework .",
    "in which case we would be observing galaxies in the ` on ' and ` off ' phase of such a cycle .",
    "@xcite present a model where truncated spirals evolve through the e(a ) ( galaxy with strong h@xmath36 and modest oii emission ) , a+k and finally k+a phase before settling on the red sequence .",
    "if we are observing galaxies at random along their spectrophotometric transformation , and given the @xmath45 gyr duration of the most visible k+a phase , the timescale for evolution of these galaxies on to the red sequence is long , @xmath46 gyr , which is consistent with the above simulations .",
    "only low mass objects can then truly evolve on to the red sequence in reasonable times .",
    "a series of questions remain unanswered for future studies .",
    "do k+a galaxies host on - going dusty starbursts ?",
    "this appears unlikely in the light of our results , but the detection of powerful far infrared excesses by @xcite points to the existence of extra sources of flux that are heavily obscured .",
    "what is the role of the agn ( if any ) in modulating the rapid onset and decline of star formation ?",
    "do these objects contain cold gas and possibly re - initiate star formation ?",
    "future papers by our group will attempt to address some of these issues .",
    "we thank neal miller for reading this paper and providing helpful comments which improved our analysis .",
    "we also thank eric wilcots and mark lacy for useful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge the anonymous referee for providing constructive suggestions .",
