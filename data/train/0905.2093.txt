    "the problem of construction of such multidimensional nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) which are either completely integrable or , at least , possess a big manifold of particular solutions is very attractive problem of integrability theory .",
    "first of all , one should emphasize several remarkable classical works regarding the completely integrable models such as @xcite ( where the korteweg - de vries equation ( kdv ) has been first time studied ) , @xcite ( where the dressing method for a big class of soliton and instanton equations has been formulated ) , @xcite ( where the so - called sato approach to the integrability is applied to kadomtsev - petviashvili equation ( kp ) ) .",
    "a big class of the first order systems of quasilinear pdes is integrated in @xcite using the generalized hodograph method .",
    "however , most of the above integrable nonlinear pdes are ( 2 + 1)- and/or ( 1 + 1)-dimensional , excepting the selfdual - type pdes @xcite and the equations assotiated with commuting vector fields @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use modification of the algorithm represented in @xcite allowing one to construct new multidimensional partially integrable nonlinear pdes .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that frobenious reduction of the matrix fields of the nonlinear pdes integrable either by the hoph - cole substitution @xcite ( @xmath0-integrable pde @xcite ) or by the method of characteristics @xcite ( @xmath1-integrable pde ) leads to one of two big classes of the nonlinear pdes integrable by the inverse spectral transform method ( istm ) @xcite ( @xmath2-integrable pdes @xcite ) .",
    "these classes are ( @xmath3 ) soliton equations , such as kdv @xcite , the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xcite , the kadomtsev - petviashvili equation ( kp ) @xcite , the deavi - stewartson equation ( ds ) @xcite , and ( @xmath4 ) instanton equations , such as the self - dual yang - mills equation ( sdym ) @xcite .",
    "the natural question is whether the frobenius reduction ( or its modification ) can be used for construction new types of integrable ( or at least partially integrable ) systems starting with any known integrable system or this method works only for derivation of soliton and instanton pdes from @xmath0- and @xmath1-integrable ones ?    at first glance the answer is negative .",
    "in fact , one can verify that frobenius reduction applied to such matrix @xmath2-integrable pde as the gl(@xmath5 ) sdym , the @xmath5-wave equation and the kp produces the same @xmath2-integrable pde .",
    "however , there is a method to generate new higher dimensional partially integrable systems of nonlinear pdes using frobenius type reduction after the appropriate differential reduction imposed on the matrix fields of the above @xmath2-integrable nonlinear pdes .",
    "such combination of reductions has been already used in @xcite .",
    "it is shown there that gl(@xmath5 ) sdym supplemented by the pair of reductions , namely , differential reduction relating certain blocks of the matrix field and frobenius reduction of these blocks , produces a new five - dimensional system of matrix nonlinear pdes ( with three - dimensional solution space ) , whose scalar reduction results in the nonlinear pde assotiated with commuting vector fields @xcite .    following the strategy of ref.@xcite",
    ", we consider an algorithm for construction new partially integrable pdes starting with the matrix kp ( although this algorithm may be applied to any @xmath2-integrable model ) .",
    "we will derive two representative of matrix systems whose scalar reductions yield the following four - dimensional equations : @xmath6 another reduction , @xmath7 reduces these pdes into the following three - dimensional ones @xmath8 here we take @xmath9 and @xmath10 as evolutionary parameters ( times ) while @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are taken as space parameters . since the linear parts of eqs.([nl_ex2 ] ) and ( [ ex_3dim2 ] ) coincide with the linear parts of the kp and the kdv respectively , eqs.([nl_ex2 ] ) and ( [ ex_3dim2 ] ) may be treated as new variants of kp- and kdv - type equations respectively .",
    "the feature of these equations is that the derivative with respect to @xmath12 appears only in the nonlinear parts .",
    "for this reason , these equations may be referred to as dispersionless ones .",
    "remember , that the kp originates from the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0-integrable brgers hierarchy due to the frobenius reduction @xcite .",
    "thus the complete set of transformations leading to eqs.([nl_ex1 ] ) and ( [ nl_ex2 ] ) is following ( see also fig.1 ) .",
    "we start with the @xmath0-integrable brgers hierarchy of nonlinear pdes with independent variables @xmath11 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 . frobenius reduction of this hierarchy @xcite yields the proper hierarchy of discrete chains of nonlinear pdes , which is equivalent to the chains obtained in the sato approach to the integrability of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional kp @xcite .",
    "the later may be derived as an intermediate result of our algorithm after eliminating all extra fields using combination of the first and the second representatives of the constructed discrete hierarchy .",
    "next , apply the differential reduction introducing one more independent variable @xmath12 .",
    "this step yields a three - dimensional system of nonlinear pdes , i.e. dimensionality coincides with that of kp .",
    "finally , the frobenius type reduction applied to the matrix fields of the latter nonlinear pdes results in a four - dimensional system of matrix pdes whose scalar versions yield eqs.([nl_ex1],[nl_ex2 ] ) .",
    "it will be shown that the derived four - dimensional nonlinear pdes may not be completely integrated by our method because the available solution spaces to them are restricted .",

    "this reduction introduces a new independent variables @xmath12 and @xmath9 and allows one to generate @xmath32 three - dimensional matrix pdes .",
    "frobenius type reduction of the above pdes results in the four - dimensional systems of @xmath33 matrix pdes , sec.[section : ftr ] .",
    "scalar versions of these pdes result in eqs.([nl_ex1 ] ) and ( [ nl_ex2 ] ) which , in particular , may be reduced to eqs.([ex_3dim1 ] ) and ( [ ex_3dim2 ] ) respectively .",
    "solution spaces to the nonlinear pdes derived in secs.[section : dr ] and [ section : ftr ] will be studied in sec.[section : solutions ] .",
    "the obstacles to the complete integrability of eqs.([nl_ex1 ] ) , ( [ nl_ex2 ] ) , ( [ ex_3dim1 ] ) and ( [ ex_3dim2 ] ) as well as the obstacles to their integrability by the istm are briefly discussed in sec.[section : obstacle ] .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.[section : conclusions ] .",
    "here we use the brgers hierarchy as a simplest example of @xmath0-integrable hierarchies linearizable by the matrix hopf - cole substitution .",

    "we remark that solution space to four - dimensional eq.([nl_ex1 ] ) ( available due to our algorithm ) is two - dimensional as well , while solution spaces to three - dimensional equations ( [ ex_3dim1 ] ) and ( [ ex_3dim2 ] ) are one - dimensional , which may be obtained owing to the formulae ( [ psi_sol0_fr_scalar ] ) and ( [ psi_red_scalar ] ) .    since eqs.([nl_ex1_sc ] ) and ( [ nl_ex2 ] ) have been derived from the matrix kp and the later is well known ( 2 + 1)-dimensional pde integrable by the istm , one can expect the same type of integrability of eqs.([nl_ex1_sc ] ) and ( [ nl_ex2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , one can expect that these equations are compatibility conditions of some overdetermined linear spectral problem derivable from the overdetermined linear spectral problem for the matrix kp .",
    "however , this is not true . in the next subsection",
    "we consider eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) as an example and show that the linear spectral problem for this equation is not well defined .",
    "thus , at the moment , the istm is not a suitable tool for solving eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) .",
    "the same conclusion is valid for eq.([nl_ex1_sc ] ) , ( [ ex_3dim1 ] ) and ( [ ex_3dim2 ] ) as well .",
    "although the algorithm described above allows one to find a big manifold of solutions to eqs.([nl_ex1_sc ] ) , ( [ nl_ex2 ] ) , ( [ ex_3dim1 ] ) and ( [ ex_3dim2 ] ) it does not gives us an algorithm to derive the linear spectral problem for any of these equations , i.e. , at the moment , we are not able to obtain such overdetermined system of linear equations for some spectral function whose compatibility condition results in eq.([nl_ex1_sc ] ) , or eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) , or eq.([ex_3dim1 ] ) , or eq.([ex_3dim2 ] ) without additional requirements to the coefficients of linear system . as an example explaining this problem , we consider eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) as nonlinear equation derivable from the matrix kp ( [ matrixkp ] ) after differential reduction ( introduced in sec.[section : diff_reduction ] ) followed by the frobenious type reduction ( introduced in sec.[section : ftr ] ) in this subsection .    the obstacle to derive the linear spectral problem for eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) is assotiated with the spectral representation of differential reduction ( [ ww_i],[qp_i ] ) which is a reduction of the potentials of the linear spectral problem for the matrix kp . in other words , we do not know which reduction must be imposed on the spectral function to generate the above differential reduction for the potentials of the spectral problem .",
    "thus the problem of spectral representation of the eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) remains open as well as the problem of its complete integrability .",
    "nevertheless , we derive some linear spectral problem whose compatibility condition leads to eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) imposing the above differential reduction `` by hand '' .    the spectral problem for matrix",
    "kp ( [ matrixkp ] ) reads @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a spectral function and @xmath206 is a spectral parameter .",
    "differential reduction ( [ ww_i],[qp_i ] ) requires the following block structure of @xmath205 : @xmath207 where @xmath208 are @xmath209 matrices .",
    "so that equations ( [ sp_p_kp ] ) acquire the following block structure : @xmath210 where @xmath211 are @xmath212 matrix equations . the spectral problem is now represented by the first - row blocks of eq.([f_red ] ) : @xmath213 while the second - row blocks of eq.([f_red ] ) are equivalent to the system ( [ lin_dif_1]-[lin_dif_4 ] ) up to the replacement of the spectral functions @xmath214 , @xmath125 .",
    "emphasize that the differential reduction is already imposed on the coefficients of the above linear system due to the special form of the functions @xmath215 and @xmath216 given by eq.([qp_i ] ) .",
    "it may be shown by the direct calculations that the compatibility conditions of eqs.([lin_dif_1]-[lin_dif_4 ] ) yield the system of nonlinear pdes which is equivalent to system ( [ dif_1 ] ) , ( [ dif_3 ] ) , i.e. we derive two complete compatible systems of nonlinear pdes so that eqs.([dif_1 ] ) describe the @xmath13-evolution while eqs.([dif_3 ] ) describe the @xmath10-evolution of fields . however , since differential reduction has not spectral representation , these nonlinear systems may not be integrated by the istm .",
    "of course , this means that the eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) ( which has been derived from the above system of nonlinear pdes after the frobenious type reduction ( [ g_f ] ) ) may not be integrated by the istm as well .",
    "however , for the sake of completeness , we consider the frobenious type reduction ( [ g_f ] ) imposed on the linear system ( [ lin_dif_1]-[lin_dif_4 ] ) .",
    "first of all , note that this reduction requires the following structure of the functions @xmath217 and @xmath218 : @xmath219 where @xmath220 are @xmath33 functions .",
    "eqs.([lin_dif_1]-[lin_dif_4 ] ) acquire the following block structure : @xmath221 where @xmath222 are @xmath33 matrix equations . similarly to eq.([f_red ] ) , only the first - row blocks of these equations represent the system of independent spectral equations : @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 here we take into account eq.([a_nu_mu ] ) and take @xmath226 without loss of generality . the system of linear pdes ( [ lin_dif_fr_1]-[lin_dif_fr_4 ] ) , @xmath52 represents the overdetermined system whose compatibility condition results in the complete system of nonlinear pdes which includes equations ( [ nl_ch_1_fr_1_newvar ] ) , ( [ nl_ch_3_mod_fr_1_newvar ] ) and ( [ nl4_fr_1_newvar ] ) as a complete subsystem , whose scalar version ( @xmath167 ) results in eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) .",
    "we have constructed two examples of the four - dimensional nonlinear pdes starting with the dressing method for the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0-integrable brgers hierarchy and using combination of the frobenius type and the differential reductions .",
    "one of these examples , eq.([nl_ex2 ] ) , has the same dispersion relation as the kp does and may be referred to as the kp type equation . as a consequence , its lower dimensional reduction , eq.([ex_3dim2 ] ) , has the same dispersion relation as the kdv does and may be referred to as the kdv type equation .",
    "although the derived four - dimensional pdes are not completely integrable by our technique ( see sec.[section : obstacle ] ) , we are able to supply a big solution manifold to them with solitary wave solutions as most simple examples . the new feature of this algorithm in comparison with one represented in @xcite is the differential reduction which introduces the new independent variable @xmath12 into the nonlinear pdes . in turn",
    ", this variable allows one to introduce the set of new @xmath9-variables by formula ( [ tau ] ) , which is a new method of increasing the dimensionality of solvable nonlinear pdes . an important problem is to overcome the obstacle to the complete integrability of the derived four - dimensional nonlinear pdes ( [ nl_ex1],[nl_ex2 ] ) and their three dimensional reductions ( [ ex_3dim1],[ex_3dim2 ] ) .",
    "it is also important to find the physical application of the derived nonlinear pdes .",
    "regarding this problem we must note that the additional independent variable @xmath12 appears only in the nonlinear terms of eqs.([nl_ex2 ] ) and ( [ ex_3dim2 ] ) , which usually means the existence of solutions with break of wave profiles .",
    "so that one can expect that these equations describe the break of wave profiles in the physical systems where the kp and the kdv appear ."
