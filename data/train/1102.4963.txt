    "graphene has attracted a lot of attention since its discovery in 2004 novoselov2004 .",
    "the linear dispersion property near the dirac point leads the low - energy charge carriers obeying the massless relativistic dirac equation .",
    "thus many unique electronic and transport properties such as half - integer quantum hall effect @xcite and klein paradox @xcite are demonstrated in graphene .",
    "currently , most investigations are focused on the properties of graphene itself .",
    "there are only a few works on graphene - based heterostructures , for example , gated graphene heterostructures @xcite , graphene nanoribbon heterostructures @xcite , and graphene / hexagonal - bn heterostructures @xcite .",
    "heterostructures are usually referred to the combination of two different materials / structures @xcite . according to the analog between the one - dimensional photonic crystals containing left - handed metamaterials",
    "@xcite and the graphene - based one - dimensional periodic superlattices barbier2010,arovas2010,wang2010a , many optical properties may be introduced into the graphene - based electronic systems . in this paper",
    ", we will theoretically study the graphene heterostructures consisted of two different graphene - based superlattices ( gss ) , which can be constructed by electrostatic @xcite or magnetic barriers @xcite .",
    "since the electronic pseudospin wave may be highly localized at the interface between two different gss , it would be expected that such heterostructures may possess an unusual tunneling mode inside the zero - averaged wave - number gap @xcite .",
    "the location of such a tunneling state satisfies the impedance matching condition of the electronic pseudospin wave .",
    "now let us consider an electron of energy @xmath0 and wavevector @xmath1 ( with the fermi velocity @xmath2 m/s ) be incident at an angle @xmath3 onto a graphene heterostructure @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicate different potentials , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the period numbers . as we know that the hamiltonian of a low - energy electron in graphene is given by @xmath11 , here @xmath12 is a momentum operator , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are pauli matrices , @xmath16 is a @xmath17 unit matrix , and @xmath18 is the @xmath19th electrostatic potential .",
    "this hamiltonian acts on a two - component pseudospin state @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two components of the pseudospin wave ( here we omit the term @xmath23 due to the translation invariance in the @xmath24 direction ) .",
    "therefore , the wavefunctions @xmath25 at @xmath26 and @xmath27 inside the @xmath19th potential can be related via a transfer matrix : @xcite@xmath28where @xmath29sign@xmath30 is the @xmath26 component of the wavevector @xmath31/\\hbar v_{f}$ ] for @xmath32 , otherwise @xmath33 .",
    "using the boundary conditions , both the reflection and transmission coefficients could be obtained by the transfer matrix method , @xcite@xmath34where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is an exit angle ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and @xmath38 are the elements of the total transfer matrix @xmath39 from the incident to exit ends . once the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 are obtained , the total conductance @xmath42 of the system at zero temperature can also be calculated by using the bttiker formula @xcite , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the transmittivity and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the width of the graphene strip in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "furthermore , the fano factor in this system is given by @xcite @xmath47 .",
    "therefore the reflection , transmission , conductance , and fano factor inside such graphene - based heterostructures can be obtained by numerical calculations .",
    "based on the above formulae , we can calculate the changes of the transmission , conductance and fano factor of an electron passing through the heterostructures . in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , we show the typical electronic transmission , conductance and fano factor for different situations with the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50mev , @xmath51mev , @xmath52mev , @xmath53mev , and @xmath54 nm . for a single gs @xmath55 or @xmath56 , from fig . 2(a ) and fig .",
    "3 , the forbidden gaps do exist near the new dirac point at @xmath57mev , which is called the zero - averaged wave - number gap in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the corresponding conductance is minimal and the fano factor equals to 1/3 at the new dirac point of @xmath57mev for both cases of @xmath58 and @xmath56 .",
    "here we would like to point out that the condition for appearing the dirac point inside the gss are discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a special case with @xmath59 and @xmath60 ,",
    "the condition is simply given by @xmath61 and @xmath62 derived from eq .",
    "( 41 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , for the heterostructure @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "2(b ) , a new tunneling mode occurs inside the forbidden gap near the dirac point . due to the existence of this tunneling mode , compared with the case of the individual @xmath58 or @xmath56 , for the heterostructure the electronic conductance",
    "is greatly enhanced and the fano factor is strongly suppressed , as shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "in fact , this new tunneling mode is due to the formation of the highly localized state at the interface between @xmath63 and @xmath56 , which could be clearly seen from the density distributions of the electronic pseudospin wavefunctions in fig .",
    "the probability densities are highly localized at the interface between @xmath64 and @xmath56 , which is denoted by the vertical dot line .",
    "in order to obtain the condition of this new tunneling mode , we use the so - called matching condition of the impedance of the pseudospin wave . in infinite periodic barriers",
    ", @xmath65 obeys the bloch - floquet theorem . by using the bloch - wave expansion method in ref .",
    "@xcite , inside the gs @xmath58 or @xmath56 , @xmath66 can be written as @xmath67where @xmath68 is the @xmath26 component of the pseudospin bloch - wave vector and satisfies the eigen equation : @xmath69 [ @xmath70 is the matrix of the unit cell for @xmath63 or @xmath56 with @xmath71 or @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the length of unit cell .",
    "@xmath74 are the eigenvectors of @xmath70 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are the amplitudes of the forward ( + ) and backward ( - ) bloch waves . from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath65 at both the incident and exit regions can be , respectively , expressed by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the impedances at the incident and exit ends , and @xmath81 is the incident wavefunction . inside the gs @xmath58 , from eq .",
    "( [ blochwave1 ] ) , we can define @xmath82 and @xmath83where @xmath84 is the impedance at @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the impedance at the interface @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , and @xmath89(@xmath90 ) is a coefficient .",
    "therefore , we can obtain @xmath91with @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , the impedance of the pseudospin wave at @xmath93 inside the gs @xmath56 is given by@xmath94where @xmath95 .",
    "for a perfect tunneling mode in heterostructures , when and only when the impedances of the pseudospin waves at two sides of the interface between @xmath58 and @xmath96 satisfy @xmath97the zero reflection can be exactly reached . in this case , the reflection coefficient is also zero , i. e. , @xmath98 , thus @xmath99 at the incident end , and @xmath100 at the exit end . for the imperfect tunneling process , the condition of eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) should be replaced by @xmath101 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we plot the curve for the value of @xmath102 , see the dashed line . from fig .",
    "2(b ) , it is clear that when the value of @xmath103 is close to zero ( within the original forbidden gaps ) , there is a tunneling peak with near - unity transmittance .",
    "according to the analog between one - dimensional photonic crystal heterostructures @xcite and the graphene - based heterostructure consisted of two different superlattices , we could safely say that in our case the tunneling state is the electronic tamm state .",
    "it should be mentioned that , for the other zeroes of @xmath102 ( which are located outside of the original forbidden gaps ) , they correspond to the resonances of the propagation states , rather than the localized states .",
    "so far we only consider the gss consisted of square barriers and wells .",
    "in fact , the above results about the tunneling state will also occur inside the graphene heterostructures , which are consisted of other periodic potentials such as cosine or sine potentials @xcite . for a comparison , in fig . 5 , we also plot the electronic transmittance for the heterostructures consisted of different sine potentials .",
    "it is clearly seen that the new tunneling state also appears inside the original forbidden gaps under the optimal period numbers .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the electronic transport inside the graphene - based heterostructures consisted of two different gss .",
    "it is shown that in such heterostructures there is an unusual tunneling state inside the zero - averaged wave - number gaps , which leads to the enhancement of the electronic conductance and the suppression of the fano factor .",
    "the reason of occurring such a tunneling state is due to the highly localization of the electronic pseudospin wave at the interface between two gss .",
    "finally the matching condition of the impedance of the pseudospin wave is analytically presented .",
    "the parameters used in our study are technically feasible as demonstrated in experimental studies meyer2008,marchini2007,vazquezdeparga2008,pan2009 .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , superlattice patterns with periodicity as small as 5 nm have been imprinted on graphene using the electron - beam induced deposition .",
    "the phenomenon for occurring such a tunneling state in graphene heterostructures is potentially useful in filtering single - energy electron and is also hopefully to use in the design of graphene - based electronic devices @xcite .",
