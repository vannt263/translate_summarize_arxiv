    "the preceding letter of this volume is devoted to the measurement of the @xmath6meson parameters in the kedr experiment performed during energy scans from 3.67 to 3.92 gev at the vepp-4 m @xmath7collider . in this letter",
    "we describe the application of the developed tools to the measurement of @xmath0parameters omitting details common for @xmath6and @xmath0 .",
    "since the discovery of the @xmath0 , seven experiments contributed to the determination of its parameters , nevertheless the situation with the mass , total width and electron partial width is still not clear .",
    "the incomplete compilation of results reported on @xmath0mass is presented in table  [ tab : mcomp ] .",
    "it does not include the results of refs .",
    "@xcite with the analysis of the @xmath8 data of bes  @xcite and the @xmath9 data of belle  @xcite in which the @xmath0electron width has been fixed in the fits causing a mass bias .",
    "in addition , the bin size in belle data around @xmath0 seems too large for a simple center - of - bin fitting .",
    "these works encouraged us to employ the vector dominance model in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "the values presented form three partially overlapping clusters .",
    "the first one with @xmath10 comes from the analyses in which interference between resonant and nonresonant @xmath1production has been ignored  @xcite .",
    "the statistical uncertainty in this case is small ( in @xcite the influence of @xmath11 and higher @xmath12 s included in the analysis increases the @xmath0mass uncertainty ) .",
    "the second cluster of @xmath13 analyses   @xcite has @xmath14 ( the result of @xcite is not included because of its uncertain status ) .",
    "the third , highest mass , cluster is formed by the analyses accounting for interference  @xcite and gives @xmath15 .    as was mentioned in section 5.2 of the previous letter ,",
    "taking into account the resonance ",
    "continuum interference is essential for a determination of the @xmath0parameters .",
    "a close @xmath1production threshold significantly increases the importance of that .",
    "a consideration of the interference effects is one of the primary goals of this experiment .",
    "if interference is ignored in a fit of the measured @xmath1 or multihadron cross section , a bias appears in the growing continuum contribution that causes a bias in the resonance amplitude and a shift of the mass value .",
    "the signs of these effects depend on the relative position of the interference peak and dip .",
    "the @xmath1cross section at the threshold is fixed at zero , therefore the weights of the more distant data points in a fit are larger than those of the less distant ones .",
    "evidence for a dip after the @xmath1cross section maximum is visible in all published data with large enough statistics ( see , for example , fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , therefore , the artificial mass shift should be negative ( undercounted events move the resonance peak to the left ) .",
    "that is exactly what we observe analyzing the published mass results .    if the result on mass of  @xcite is ignored , the @xmath0mass value obtained in @xmath16 decays does not contradict neither to @xmath17 nor @xmath18 .",
    "the interference of the resonant and nonresonant @xmath19 yields also takes place in this case but the relation between them can differ from that in @xmath7collisions , besides , the interference effect can be partially compensated by subtraction of the combinatorial background .",
    "thus , the intermediate mass value does not seem surprising .",
    "below we briefly describe the theoretical basis of the analysis performed , enter some details concerning the analysis procedure and not covered in , present the results on the @xmath0parameters and discuss their systematic uncertainties and model dependence .",

    "a few approaches can be employed to determine the resonance parameters using a multihadron cross section data . in the  @xcite the fit of the @xmath40 ratio",
    "was performed , in the  @xcite the efficiency  corrected cross section was analyzed .",
    "there are many different sources of multihadron events such as the @xmath6and @xmath0production , the light quark production etc .",
    ", thus the variation of the net detection efficiency in the whole experiment range can exceed 20%  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the net efficiency implies knowledge of the resonance parameters and accounting for the interference effects , therefore an iterative analysis is required . in this work",
    "we fit the observed multihadron cross section not corrected for the detection efficiency which allows iterations to be avoided .      in the energy range from slightly below the @xmath6 peak to slightly above the @xmath42 threshold the variation of the light quark contribution to @xmath40 ( @xmath43 )",
    "is small , so that the multihadron cross section observed in the experiment can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 s are theoretical cross sections , @xmath46 s are corresponding detection efficiencies , and @xmath47 s are terms treated empirically as described below .",
    "the @xmath48 superscript means that the cross section has been corrected for initial state radiation ( isr ) effects , @xmath49 stands for the direct @xmath0decay to light hadrons , the other ( super / sub)scripts seem self - explanatory , @xmath50 is a branching fraction .",

    "corresponding to the light quark contribution can be scaled as @xmath51 where a relatively small parameter @xmath52 is due to the energy dependence of the detection efficiency and radiative corrections . possible variation of @xmath43 can also contribute to @xmath52 .",
    "this term can be easily removed from the consideration in the fit of the cross section provided that the @xmath52 value is known .",
    "the @xmath42 cross section can be treated as a small correction .",
    "we took it into account using the approximately known shape and an additional fit parameter .",
    "calculations for @xmath53 and @xmath54 are described in , a small contribution of the @xmath55 tail was calculated similarly to the @xmath6one , for the @xmath1production cross section ( here and below @xmath41 stands for @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) one has @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the probability to lose a fraction of @xmath60 in the initial state radiation  @xcite , @xmath61 describes a distribution of the total collision energy , which can be assumed to be gaussian with an energy spread @xmath62 .",
    "for the charged mode ( @xmath63 ) the factor @xmath64 describing the coulomb interaction between the mesons produced  @xcite is taken according to sommerfeld - sakharov  @xcite : @xmath65 for the neutral mode ( @xmath66 ) there is no such interaction , thus @xmath67 the step functions @xmath68 are shown explicitly to simplify some expressions below .",
    "the cross section @xmath69 can be expressed via the form factor @xmath2 and @xmath41-meson velocity in the c.m.system @xmath70 : @xmath71    to determine the parameters of resonances above the @xmath1threshold , their amplitudes should be separated in @xmath2 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the phase of the @xmath74-th resonance @xmath75 relative to @xmath76 .    for the resonance with the partial widths @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the total width @xmath79 , one has a breit - wigner amplitude @xmath80 ( the vacuum polarization factor is included in @xmath77 ) .    considering @xmath81 as a nominal resonance width and introducing the sum of the branching fractions to all non-@xmath1modes @xmath50 , one obtains the energy - dependent @xmath1partial width @xmath82 in line with the pdg prescriptions ( p. 808 of ref .",

    "we remind that the full polarization operator is calculated using the total cross section of @xmath94 that already includes all resonances , therefore use of the full operator @xmath95 instead of @xmath93 in the nonresonant amplitude leads to double counting of the resonances and thus incorrect values of the leptonic widths ( see also the discussion in sec .",

    "the third error arises from the model dependence .",
    "it was estimated comparing the results obtained under the assumption of vector dominance in the @xmath41-meson form factor ( quoted values ) and under a few alternative assumptions which do not imply vector dominance .",
    "the quoted model errors do not include possible deviations of the resonance shape from the breit - wigner one with usual assumptions about the total width energy dependence , which are predicted , e.g. , in the coupled - channel model  @xcite .",
    "the result on the @xmath0mass agrees with that by babar also taking into account interference ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and is significantly higher than all results obtained ignoring this effect .",

    "most of potential models support the first solution and can barely tolerate the second one .",
    "the increase of the @xmath0mass according to the babar and kedr measurements implies the decrease of the @xmath172-@xmath173 mixing used in potential models to rise the electron width value above 100  ev ( refs .",
    "@xcite and the reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "the correct choice of the true solution is extremely important for a determination of the non-@xmath1fraction of @xmath0decays .",
    "because of the large uncertainty the solution ( 1 ) does not contradict formally to the previously published results , which do not take the interference effect into account , the solution ( 2 ) is only two standard deviations higher than the current world average .",
    "however , the qualitative consideration and numerical estimates confirm that the impact of the resonance  continuum interference on the resulting electron width value is large , therefore the resonance parameters obtained taking into account interference can not be directly compared with the corresponding values obtained ignoring this effect .",
