    "this decay proceeds like the @xmath426 decay that we have evaluated and one has a @xmath200 at the end . since the @xmath192 is @xmath20 then this is forbidden in our approach , at the tree level that we have considered for the vector production .",
    "experimentally , this rate is @xmath57 .",
    "this is an upper bound about @xmath427 times smaller than the rate of the omega production that we have evaluated .",
    "we do not want to go beyond , but can give some idea on how a finite rate could be obtained in our approach .",
    "for this one would have to hadronize the @xmath200 into a @xmath272 , then have a loop for @xmath272 propagation in @xmath428-wave and finally have the @xmath272 couple to the @xmath192 .",
    "some technical details could be borrowed from the study of @xmath429 decay studied in  @xcite but one can get an indication that the rate should be rather small by simply noting that the hadronization to meson  meson pairs has a reduction factor , as one can see by comparing for instance @xmath430 production with @xmath258 production  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the coupling of @xmath192 to @xmath272 is intrinsically small , as one can see from the @xmath431 partial decay width of this channel [ comparatively the @xmath432 partial decay width to the @xmath433 channel would be about @xmath434 for a pion with the same momentum as the kaon in the @xmath192 decay ] .",
    "there are other factors to consider , but this can give us a feeling that the rate could be some orders of magnitude smaller than for omega production .",
    "finally we compare the mass distributions of the two pseudoscalar mesons in @xmath245- and @xmath428-wave contributions . in the present approach",
    "the @xmath245-wave part comes from the rescattering of two pseudoscalar mesons including the scalar meson contribution , while the @xmath428-wave one from the decay of a vector meson . in this study",
    "we consider three decay modes : @xmath72 , @xmath392 , and @xmath435 .",
    "the @xmath436 decay mode would have a large @xmath428-wave contribution from @xmath437 , but we do not consider this decay mode since it is a cabibbo suppressed process .",
    "first we consider the @xmath72 decay mode .",
    "this is a specially clean mode , since it does not have vector meson contributions and is dominated by the @xmath245-wave part .",
    "namely , while the @xmath12 can come from a scalar meson , the primary quark ",
    "antiquark pair in the semileptonic @xmath0 decay is @xmath20 , which is isospin @xmath438 and hence the @xmath437 can not contribute to the @xmath12 mass distribution .",
    "the primary @xmath20 can be @xmath32 , but it decays dominantly to @xmath21 and the @xmath439 decay is negligible .",
    "this fact enables us to observe the scalar meson peak without a contamination from vector meson decays and discuss the quark configuration in the @xmath5 resonance as in sec .",
    "[ sec : scalar ] .",
    "invariant mass distribution for the semileptonic decay @xmath392 both in @xmath245 and @xmath428 waves .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=325 ]    next let us consider the @xmath392 decay mode .",
    "as we have seen , the @xmath271 mass distribution in @xmath245 wave is a consequence of the @xmath5 tail .",
    "however , its contribution should be largely contaminated by the @xmath440 in @xmath428 wave , which has a larger branching fraction than the @xmath441 in the semileptonic decay . in order to see this",
    ", we calculate the @xmath428-wave @xmath271 mass distribution for @xmath392 , which can be formulated as @xmath442 } { [ m_{\\rm inv}^{(hh ) } ] ^{2 } - m_{v}^{2 }   + i m_{v } \\gamma _ { v } ( m_{\\rm inv}^{(hh ) } ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath146 is the vector meson mass and the energy dependent decay width @xmath443 is defined as @xmath444 @xmath445^{2 } , \\ , m_{h}^{2 } , \\ , m_{h}^{\\prime 2 } ) } { 2 m_{\\rm inv}^{(hh ) } } , \\ ] ] @xmath446 for the @xmath32 meson we take @xmath447 and @xmath448 = 0.489 $ ]  @xcite . the numerical result for the @xmath449 mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpkm ] together with the @xmath450 . from the figure , compared to the @xmath451 contribution we can not find any significant @xmath452 contribution , which was already noted in the experimental mass distribution in ref .  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the @xmath452 fraction of the semileptonic @xmath0 decay is large enough to be extracted  @xcite . actually in ref .",
    "@xcite they extracted the @xmath452 fraction by analysing the interference between the @xmath245- and @xmath428-wave contributions .",
    "this fact , and the qualitative reproduction of the branching fractions in our model , implies that the @xmath5 resonance couples to the @xmath21 channel with a certain strength , which can be translated into the @xmath21 component in @xmath70 , in a similar manner to the @xmath453 component in @xmath454  @xcite , in terms of the compositeness  @xcite .",
    "anyway , in order to conclude the structure of the @xmath5 more clearly , it is important to reduce the experimental errors on the @xmath452 .",
    "invariant mass distribution for the semileptonic decay @xmath455 both in @xmath245 and @xmath428 waves .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=325 ]    finally we consider the @xmath455 decay mode . in this mode",
    "the @xmath456 from the @xmath457 and the @xmath458 from the @xmath459 are competing with each other . in a similar manner to the @xmath392 case",
    ", we calculate the mass distribution also for the @xmath428-wave @xmath309 contribution @xmath460 with @xmath461  @xcite , and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppkm ] . as one can see , thanks to the width of @xmath462 for the @xmath9 , the @xmath245-wave component can dominate the mass distribution below @xmath463 .",
    "we note that we would obtain an almost similar result for the @xmath464 decay mode due to isospin symmetry .    as to the theoretical uncertainties , we can play a bit with the cut - offs used to regularize the loops , such that the masses of the states do not change appreciably .",
    "this exercise has been done a number of times and given us the feeling that within our models the uncertainties are below @xmath465 .",
    "for the case of scalar production where we have a range of invariant masses and rely upon a constant production vertex @xmath210 , the changes with the invariant mass in the primary form factors , prior to the final state interaction of the mesons , as found in  @xcite , would add some extra uncertainty . in total",
    "it would be fair to accept about @xmath466 uncertainties in this case in the limited range of energies that we move .",
    "in this study we have discussed the semileptonic decays of @xmath11 mesons into light scalar and vector mesons . for the scalar meson production ,",
    "we have formulated the semileptonic decay as the combination of two parts .",
    "one is the weak decay of the charm quark and the emission of a lepton pair via the @xmath100 boson .",
    "the other is a simple hadronization of light @xmath34 pair plus an extra @xmath35 from vacuum into two pseudoscalar mesons after the @xmath100 boson emission , so as to generate the scalar mesons dynamically in the meson  meson final state interaction .",
    "the hadronization naturally gives the weight of each pair of pseudoscalar mesons in the decay process , which governs which scalar meson appears in the decay mode .",
    "for the vector mesons , on the other hand , we have not considered the hadronization with an extra @xmath35 and have directly used the light @xmath34 pair after the @xmath100 boson emission as a weight for the vector mesons , which are expected to be genuinely @xmath34 states .",
    "we note that we can specify flavors of quarks contained in the final state scalar and vector mesons by considering cabibbo favored and suppressed processes .",
    "in addition , since the leptons interact only weakly , the semileptonic decay of the heavy meson to two light mesons @xmath69 brings a suitable condition to measure effects of the final state interaction of the two light mesons .    in our model of the semileptonic decay ,",
    "the production yields of the scalar and vector mesons are respectively determined solely by constant prefactors @xmath210 and @xmath248 as model parameters .",
    "fixing @xmath210 from the branching fraction of the @xmath467 decay , we have calculated branching fractions of scalar meson productions .",
    "we have qualitatively reproduced the experimental value of the branching fractions of @xmath468 and @xmath469 decay modes .",
    "some deviations of these branching fractions compared to the experimental values can be explained by taking into account the background of the mass distribution for the @xmath12 case and by the large experimental error for the @xmath271 case . for the vector mesons ,",
    "we have determined the constant @xmath248 so as to fit our numerical values to the available experimental values of the branching fractions , and we have reproduced the experimental values at a quantitative level .",
    "we also compared the mass distributions of the two pseudoscalar mesons in @xmath245- and @xmath428-wave contributions , which come from decays of the scalar and vector mesons , respectively .",
    "we have found that the cabibbo favored decay mode @xmath470 followed by @xmath362 and @xmath271 is of special interest . for the @xmath471 mode , we have found that there is no @xmath428-wave contamination from @xmath7 decay and hence it should be dominated by the @xmath245-wave part .",
    "then , we have confirmed the experimental fact that the @xmath12 mass distribution shows a clear @xmath70 signal while the @xmath3 contribution is negligible .",
    "this strongly indicates that the @xmath5 has a substantial fraction of the strange quarks while the @xmath3 has a negligible strange quark component . for the @xmath472 mode ,",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath452 contribution is highly contaminated by the @xmath473 decay in @xmath428 wave .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath450 fraction of the semileptonic @xmath0 decay is large enough to be extracted experimentally , which implies that the @xmath5 resonance couples to the @xmath21 channel with a certain strength and hence implies a certain amount of the @xmath21 component in @xmath5 .",
