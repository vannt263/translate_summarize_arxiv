    "it is highly desirable to electronically manipulate the photonic spectrum of a multi - level emitter such as an atom or quantum dot ( qd ) . while it is well - known that the spectrum is influenced by the photon emitter s electromagnetic environment ( e.g. , via the purcell effect @xcite ) , engineering the environment to obtain desirable characteristics often results in a fixed structure that is not actively tunable .",
    "surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) on graphene @xcite-@xcite are highly tunable , and offer a promising way to achieve electronic control over an emitter s spectrum through interactions with graphene spps .",
    "recent scattering - type scanning near field optical microscopy ( snom ) imaging experiments @xcite have demonstrated in real space the excitation of graphene spps on finite graphene structures , and in @xcite excitation and damping of spps on graphene structures was investigated experimentally for graphene on several substrates .",
    "additionally , graphene quantum plasmonics has been considered in @xcite where vacuum rabi splitting was shown , and in @xcite where active control over a quantum state via biasing was demonstrated .    when placed in the vicinity of a multi - level emitter , graphene ,",
    "along with the vacuum density of electromagnetic field modes , forms the photonic reservoir with which the emitter interacts .",
    "the spectral and statistical properties of such a system is strongly dependent on the reservoir mode density via the local density of states ( ldos ) @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the reservoir of electromagnetic modes is altered by the presence of a metal nano - particle , and the resonance fluorescence was examined in the vicinity of the nano - particle plasmon resonance .",
    "several disadvantages of this system is that the ldos is not tunable , and placing a photon emitter at the desired spatial position is challenging . from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "one desires a spatial position that is translationally invariant , e.g. , near a surface , with an ldos that can be tuned in a controllable manner .    in this work",
    "we use translationally invariant graphene , which is electronically - tunable , to alter the reservoir for a two - level artificial atom ( hereafter referred to as a qd ) in a controllable manner .",
    "furthermore , it is known that a graphene support structure consisting of a dielectric layer can play a role in shaping the ldos @xcite , and so we also consider the effect of a substrate on the resonance fluorescence . since the plasmon response of graphene exhibits a strong dependance on bias in the low - mid thz ( mev ) frequency regime , we model pump fields and qd excitons at these frequencies @xcite . after obtaining the ldos properties of the medium , we derive and solve a quantum master equation to demonstrate control over the mollow triplet @xcite of a qd by a nearby graphene sheet . the complex reservoir including the graphene constitutes a lossy inhomogeneous environment for the qd , and here we use a rigorous photon green function theory applicable for arbitrary lossy media @xcite .",
    "the mollow triplet is caused by coherent rabi oscillations and quantum fluctuations and is of fundamental importance .",
    "in addition to exploring how the mollow triplet changes with a tunable graphene layer , we also show that thermal bath effects are important for low thz frequencies .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the geometry under consideration , consisting of a qd which is a distance @xmath0 from an infinite graphene sheet .",
    "the polarization of the pump field is aligned with the dipole moment , perpendicular to the graphene surface .",
    "the hamiltonian of the coupled system is the sum of qd , pump , reservoir ( graphene+vacuum ) , and their interaction , @xmath1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the thz laser frequency of the pump field , @xmath3 are the pauli operators of the qd exciton , @xmath4 is the effective rabi frequency of the pump source ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the qd dipole moment and position ) , @xmath7 are bosonic field operators , @xmath8 is the exciton resonance , and @xmath9 is the total electric field operator at the qd position @xcite , @xmath10 where the permittivity ( @xmath11 ) and green function ( @xmath12 ) describe the photonic environment ( reservoir ) of the graphene and dielectric background .",
    "the green tensor in the quantum field operator is the classical green function ( propagator ) that provides the electromagnetic response at @xmath13 due to an excitation at @xmath14 .",
    "all material parameters may be complex - valued .",
    "this hamiltonian is used to form a quantum master equation as described in ref .",

    "the green functions for a graphene sheet at the interface between two dielectrics are given in @xcite , and in @xcite for graphene on a finite - thickness dielectric support .",

    "the scattered green s function can be written as discrete pole ( spp ) contributions plus a branch cut integral over the continuum of radiation modes . for @xmath52 , setting the denominator of ( [ c ] ) to zero leads to the ( tm ) spp wavenumber @xmath53 where @xmath54 . in this case",

    "the graphene surface conductivity is @xcite,@xmath63 where @xmath64 is chemical potential , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are phenomenological intraband and interband scattering rates , respectively ( @xmath67 is the scattering time ) , @xmath68 is the charge of an electron , and @xmath69 is the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the first and second terms in the conductivity are due to intraband and interband contributions , respectively . for @xmath70 @xcite@xmath71 in the following we use ( [ gen ] ) for @xmath72",
    "k and ( [ t0 ] ) for @xmath73 k calculations .",
    "we consider a local ( momentum independent ) conductivity since the main effect considered here is the nontrivial dos provided by the graphene plasmon energy dispersion .",
    "the drude form of the conductivity has been verified in the far - infrared @xcite-@xcite , and in the near infrared and visible the interband behavior has been verified in @xcite . in the absence of scattering and bias",
    "the high - frequency optical conductivity is @xmath74 , which has been verified in optical experiments @xcite .",
    "absorption is associated with both scattering and interband transitions . since realistic values of @xmath66",
    "will have a negligible effect on the results we will ignore interband scattering . for @xmath75 interband absorption is blocked , otherwise interband absorption will often dominate re(@xmath26 ) . for the intraband term",
    "the value of @xmath65 generally depends on temperature via phonon interactions , the method of growth / fabrication ( e.g. , epitaxial , chemical vapor deposition , exfoliation ) , the presence of impurities , and the presence of a substrate .",
    "measured values of scattering times at room temperature ranged from a few fs @xcite-@xcite to several tens of fs @xcite-@xcite to several hundred fs ( @xmath76 0.35 ps @xcite-@xcite ) , and at low temperature scattering times on the order of a few ps have been measured ( 1.1 ps @xcite and 5 ps @xcite ) .",
    "short scattering times are usually associated with impurities and defects since the room - temperature electron - phonon scattering time is estimated to be a few ps @xcite . in the following we assume @xmath77 ps for @xmath73 and @xmath78 ps for room temperature results .",
    "we assume lossless non - dispersive dielectrics to focus on graphene s electrodynamic response rather than on the substrate response .",
    "the partial ldos projected normal to the graphene surface , @xmath79 , normalized by the free - space value @xmath80 gives the purcell factor @xcite ( i.e. , the enhanced spontaneous emission factor of a single photon emitter)@xmath81 in the following we consider both suspended graphene , where vacuum exists on either side of the graphene sheet , and supported graphene on a dielectric layer . figure [ fig:2](a ) shows the tunability of the purcell factor @xcite at thz frequencies for a single suspended graphene layer over a range of chemical potentials at a distance of 10 nm from the graphene surface for @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( at room temperature the results of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] will hold with minor quantitative changes ) .",
    "it is clear that in the low thz regime the ldos and purcell factor can be tuned considerably by an external bias .",
    "figure [ fig:2](b ) shows the purcell factor for supported graphene on a @xmath84 nm thin substrate having relative permittivity @xmath85 ( the approximate permittivity of @xmath86 ) .",
    "the presence of the substrate perturbs the spp of the suspended graphene sheet , and clearly red - shifts the purcell factor maximums ( larger values of @xmath87 would further red - shift the purcell factor ) . as discussed in @xcite , the presence of a substrate tends to confine the spp mode , leading to higher attenuation as energy concentrates at the lossy graphene surface .",
    "figure [ fig:2](c ) shows the purcell factor for two layers of graphene separated by a 10 nm , @xmath85 substrate .",
    "this case closely resembles the result of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , although the bottom graphene layer leads to a parallel - plate like waveguide structure @xcite , which tends to further concentrate energy in the dielectric , narrowing and shifting the pf peaks .",
    "figure [ fig:2](d ) shows the purcell factor as a function of position and frequency for supported graphene on a 10 nm , @xmath884 substrate . clearly , to be able to tune the qd resonance florescence the qd needs to be located sufficiently close to the graphene surface to strongly couple to the graphene spp , due to the strong confinement of the spp mode . however , one of the advantages of using graphene sheets is that this coupling is translationally invariant in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 directions .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the purcell factor for suspended graphene for three different values of chemical potential at @xmath73 ( a ) and @xmath72 k ( b ) .",
    "it can be seen that at the higher temperature the peaks are broadened due to higher absorption compared to the @xmath73 result .",
    "figure [ fig:3](c)-(d ) show the conductivity for the @xmath9180 mev case . as frequency increases from a low value ,",
    "the drude ( intraband ) term drops off at @xmath65 and the interband contribution becomes more important , with a sharp transition in the real - part when @xmath921 .",
    "the imaginary part undergoes a cusp - discontinuity ( for @xmath73 k ) at @xmath931 .",
    "when im@xmath94 , as occurs in the vicinity of the cusp , the tm spp can not propagate ( generally , when this occurs a te spp can propagate , although for a vertical dipole excitation the te spp will not be excited ) , and this is associated with the drop - off of the purcell factor .",
    "the peak in the purcell factor corresponds approximately to the frequency where @xmath95 .",
    "the incoherent spectrum is defined as @xmath96    where the second term subtracts the coherent scattering from the pump field .",
    "the incoherent spectrum of the qd is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:4](a - c ) for a rabi frequency of 10 mev at 25 thz , assuming @xmath73 ( see the purcell factor of fig .  [ fig:3](a ) ) ; in all subsequent results the dipole moment is taken to be @xmath97 debye .",
    "note that the pump field will naturally be efficiently increased by the coupling to the spp .",
    "it is evident that by changing the chemical potential of graphene the weights of the sidebands can be substantially changed .",
    "that is , the dominant peak of the incoherent spectrum can be shifted , for example , by varying the bias voltage on graphene . as fig .",
    "3 shows , by varying the bias we can shift the peak of the ldos ; when the ldos peak aligns with the peak of one of the mollow triplets , the corresponding triplet is enhanced .",
    "commensurately , a small value of the ldos at the position of a triplet peak suppresses that peak ( due to closure of the plasmon decay channel ) .",
    "this is one of the key results of the paper : the quantum coupling between qds and graphene can be profoundly influenced by simply changing the bias field .",
    "note that in all three cases in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] the exciton - laser detuning is zero ( @xmath98 ) and it is solely the change in the ldos with bias that is responsible for the significant spectrum tuning . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) , at t=300 k the peaks are broadened but are not significantly shifted compared to the @xmath73 case .",
    "therefore , at room temperature the mollow triplet can also be controlled .",
    "however , in this case since the peaks overlap more than for @xmath73 it is advantageous to choose the rabi frequency ( which controls the separation of the triplet s peaks ) and chemical potential values ( which control the purcell factor peaks ) to further separate the peaks to achieve similar control over the triplet as in the low temperature case .",
    "the far - field detectable spectrum at position @xmath99 is defined as @xcite @xmath100 .",
    "the factor that multiplies @xmath101 has some features in the vicinity of @xmath102 , but is otherwise dominated by the homogeneous - space part of the green function and is fairly featureless , and so the mollow triplet of the detectable spectrum will resemble @xmath101 .    in fig .  [",
    "fig:3 ] the considered values of @xmath103 lead to peaks of the purcell factor in the range 20 - 30 thz . for these bias values and frequencies interband absorption is blocked , and the only damping of the conductivity is due to scattering . at several tens of thz , but for room temperature , @xmath104 is at least weakly satisfied , and the purcell factor results do not change qualitatively , although enhanced absorption broadens the curves ( fig .  [",
    "fig:3](b ) ) .",
    "furthermore , at several tens of thz , even at room temperature the average photon number @xmath105 is negligible , and so the zero - temperature bath approximation holds .",
    "however , for small - enough bias the purcell factor peaks below a few thz , in which case both @xmath104 and @xmath83 are violated at room temperature . at frequencies of a few thz and for small bias , temperature plays an important role in both the purcell factor via the graphene conductivity ( interband transitions will not be not blocked , leading to enhanced absorption , and the location of pf peak blueshifts due to the second inequality being violated ) and in the incoherent spectrum via the effect of the average photon number being non - negligible . to examine this effect , figure [ fig:5](a ) shows the purcell factor at @xmath106 nm and @xmath107 mev at @xmath108k and @xmath109k .",
    "figure [ fig:5](b ) shows the effect on the resonance fluorescence spectrum .",
    "also shown is the effect of including @xmath105 in the @xmath109k calculation , where it can be seen that the inclusion of the room temperature thermal bath is important at these low thz frequencies .",
    "figure [ fig:4](c)-(d ) show the normalized conductivity ; compared to the 300 k result in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c)-(d ) for @xmath110 mev , here the intraband contribution is still important when the interband term becomes active , significantly perturbing the ldos from the @xmath73 k case ( the drude fall - off is set by @xmath111 and the onset of interband absorption is set by @xmath103 , and",
    "so these two effects can be independently controlled , although @xmath103 also governs the amplitude of the intraband contribution ) . since we keep the same pump frequency for @xmath73 k and @xmath72 k , in the latter case",
    "the ldos is relatively flat at the pump frequency .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the purcell effect and the mollow triplet of a two - level emitter can be tuned by varying the chemical potential of a nearby graphene layer .",
    "we have modeled this effect using an exact green function theory for the ldos and exploited a quantum master equation to model the quantum dynamics .",
    "we have also demonstrated the important influence of temperature .",
    "this novel qd - graphene system allows considerable spectral control at the quantum level via altering an easily - assessable external parameters of the system .",
