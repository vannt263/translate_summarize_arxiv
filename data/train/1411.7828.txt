    "the cases with a virtual state pole at the central value are marked by [ v ] , for which @xmath77 means that the pole evolves into a bound state one and n / a means that the pole is far from the threshold with a momentum larger than 1  gev so that it is both undetectable and beyond the eft range .",

    "this is based on the approximate heavy antiquark - diquark symmetry ( hads ) that emerges from the observation that the interactions of heavy color triplet objects with the light degrees of freedom ( quarks and gluons ) are independent of the heavy color triplet s spin and mass  @xcite .",
    "a first consequence is that the spectrum of baryons with two heavy quarks can be related to the spectrum of heavy light mesons with the same light degree of freedom quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "the heavy diquark component of the baryon forms a color anti - triplet with a characteristic length scale of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the mass of the heavy quarks and @xmath80 their velocity .",
    "the length scale of the diquark is smaller than the typical qcd length scale @xmath81 and hence we can treat the diquark as point - like if the quarks are heavy enough .    within this scheme ,",
    "we hint the existence of several baryonic partners of the @xmath1 with isospin @xmath82 and @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , we predict various @xmath85 triply - heavy pentaquarks with quantum numbers @xmath86 and @xmath87 partners of the @xmath2 @xmath88 molecule .    we compile some of these approximate predictions from @xcite in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "they are subject to larger uncertainties than those collected in table  [ tab:1 ] , since violations of hads are expected to be larger than hqss and hfs ones .",
    "i.e. , @xmath89 vs @xmath90 .",
    "within the molecular picture of the @xmath5 resonance , in its decay modes with a charmonium in the final state ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) , the heavy quarks of the @xmath20 meson pair have to recombine to form the final charmonium . as a consequence , these processes are not sensitive to the @xmath20 wave function at long distances which is governed by the binding energy , but rather they are determined by the short distance part of the @xmath5 wave - function  @xcite .    the transition from the charm ",
    "anti - charm meson pair into the @xmath94 plus pions ( or a photon ) , occurs at a distance much smaller than both the size of the @xmath5 as a hadronic molecule and the range of forces between the @xmath95 and @xmath96 mesons .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath91 decay , one of the constituent hadrons ( @xmath97 ) is in the final state and the rest of the final particles are products of the decay of the other constituent hadron ( @xmath98 ) of the @xmath5 molecule . thus , in this decay the relative distance between the @xmath20 mesons can be as large as allowed by the size of the @xmath5 resonance , since the final state is produced by the decay of the @xmath96 meson instead of a rescattering transition .",
    "actually , it can be proved that within some approximations , the @xmath99 distribution is related to the @xmath5 wave - function @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the @xmath91 decay width by evaluating the diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the tree level contribution is fully determined by the @xmath101 coupling ( @xmath102 ) , the @xmath5 mass and its coupling constant to the neutral @xmath103 channel ( @xmath104 ) , which is determined by the residue of the @xmath105matrix element at the @xmath5 pole .",
    "we find  @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the polarization vector of the @xmath5 , @xmath108 is the three - momentum of the pion , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the four momenta of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 systems , respectively . taking into account the phase space , @xmath113 with the invariant masses @xmath114 and @xmath115 of the final @xmath111 and @xmath116 pairs",
    ", we readily obtain @xmath117 is the pion momentum in the @xmath5 center of mass frame [ @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , for a given value of @xmath119 , the range of @xmath120 is determined by : @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 the energies of the @xmath97 and @xmath124 in the @xmath125 rest frame , respectively , and @xmath126 the moduli of their corresponding three momenta . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found @xmath127 where the values outside and inside the parentheses are obtained with uv gaussian cutoffs of @xmath17 and 1  gev , respectively , and the errors ( grey bands in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) reflect the uncertainty in the inputs ( @xmath128 and the ratio of decay amplitudes for the @xmath129 and @xmath130 decays ) .",
    "since we published these results , new high precision measurements of the masses of the @xmath97 and @xmath131 mesons have become available  @xcite , which have led to a more precise determination of the @xmath5 binding energy , @xmath132 kev  @xcite . to obtain the central values and the errors of eq .",
    "( [ eq : restree ] ) and the 68% confident level ( cl ) bands displayed in fig",
    ".  [ fig:2 ] , we used @xmath133 kev , and a monte carlo simulation was performed to propagate errors , @xmath134120 kev , was not taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] . in the simulation",
    ", we rejected @xmath5 binding energies values smaller than 10 kev , and those values were set to this minimum value .",
    "this effectively amounts to consider @xmath135 kev , since the gaussian distribution of binding energies was truncated .",
    "we slightly decreased the lower error to guaranty a bound state with a cl larger than 68% , since the scheme followed in @xcite only allows the computation of the width when the @xmath5 state is bound .",
    "this binding energy range leads to @xmath136 ( the two values correspond to the @xmath17 and 1  gev choices of the uv regulator ) , which is not compatible with zero were quoted .",
    "these correspond to a minimum of the binding energy ( @xmath137 kev ) much closer to zero , though in the calculation of the width , the 10 kev cut , mentioned above , was used . ] .",
    "thus , the lower grey bands in fig .  [ fig:1 ] turn out not to be compatible with a zero width either",
    ". however , the new determination of @xmath132 kev makes much more probable the very low binding energies close to zero , or an unbound resonance . in this case",
    ", we would like to point out that the decay width should decrease , and eventually should vanish , as the binding energy approaches zero .",
    "this is because for very small binding energies , all the couplings of a bound state tend to zero when the mass of the bound state gets closer to the lowest threshold  @xcite .",
    "for the case of the @xmath5 , this was re - derived in @xcite and explicitly shown that both the neutral @xmath138 ( @xmath104 ) and charged @xmath139 couplings scale as @xmath140 . because of the quite limited phase space available in this @xmath141wave decay , the decay width , however , increases very rapidly as the binding energy departs from zero .",
    "in any case , the lower errors displayed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : restree ] ) and fig .  [ fig:2 ] should be now considered with some caution . moreover ,",
    "the effect of the @xmath131 width , neglected in the present calculation , becomes sizable for binding energies below 10 kev .",
    "the last two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] account for the @xmath142 final state interaction ( fsi ) effects , which are considered by means of the appropriated linear combinations of the isoscalar and isovector @xmath105matrices .",
    "to obtain these scattering amplitudes , the lo contact potential , involving the four lec s @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , is used  @xcite . as commented ,",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath2 inputs determine only three of the four counter - terms .",
    "the value of @xmath57 is not fixed , and thus the @xmath8 fsi effects on this decay are not fully determined . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , these effects might be quite large , because for a certain range of @xmath57 values , a near - threshold isoscalar @xmath8 bound state could be dynamically generated  @xcite .",
    "if in future experiments the partial decay width is measured , a significant deviation from the predicted tree level value will indicate a fsi effect , which might be used to extract the value of @xmath57 .",
    "however as discussed above , this could be obscured if turned out that the actual binding energy of the @xmath5 state is smaller than let us say 10 kev .        c.  h",
