    "precise manipulation of coupled quantum systems is at the heart of quantum technologies .",
    "quantum gates acting on two or more qubits are the building blocks of quantum algorithms and the engines of entanglement creation , the key feature which sets apart many technological applications such as quantum information processing and quantum communication@xcite from their classical counterparts .",
    "the ability to manipulate two or more interacting qubits has been demonstrated with reasonably high fidelity in many systems such as superconducting qubits,@xcite trapped ions,@xcite and optical systems,@xcite but for the purpose of quantum computing , scaling to many qubits may be ultimately easier to achieve with semiconductor spin qubits@xcite because they are nanoscale devices that can potentially take advantage of the preexisting infrastructure for fabricating semiconductor microchips.@xcite the singlet - triplet qubit,@xcite which encodes a qubit in two - electron spin states , bears the advantage that it is immune to homogeneous fluctuations in the external magnetic field and is the simplest spin qubit that can be controlled purely electrically .",
    "while it has had vast success at the single - qubit level with long coherence times and high control fidelities,@xcite the implementation of two - qubit gates has been challenging and is currently the bottleneck preventing progress towards demonstrations of quantum algorithms , which necessitate both single- and multi - qubit gate operations .",
    "attempts to design high - fidelity two - qubit gates for singlet - triplet qubits have mostly assumed that the qubits are coupled via the exchange interaction,@xcite in which case one may focus on one pair of exchange - coupled spins at a time , a great simplification from the original four - spin problem . despite its theoretical simplicity and elegance , this approach is hard to implement in experiments with multiple gate - defined quantum dots due to difficulties in addressing a single exchange coupling in the array .",
    "an alternative proposal couples two singlet - triplet qubits with a capacitive interaction , i.e. one may alter the electrostatic potential , and hence the precession rate , in the  target \" qubit by changing the electron charge configuration of the `` control '' qubit.@xcite this proposal allows for long - range , individually controllable couplings between qubits,@xcite which is important for multi - qubit devices , but also has a serious difficulty in that the capacitive coupling is typically much weaker than the exchange coupling and is much more susceptible to noise . an experimental breakthrough in this problem",
    "came from the employment of a `` simultaneous dynamical decoupling '' sequence which cancels part of the noise - induced evolution error , leading to the first demonstration of a singlet - triplet two - qubit gate , with a fidelity of 72%.@xcite in order to meet the requirement for fault - tolerant quantum computation , one must further reduce the error either at the hardware level by enhancing the capacitive coupling or making better noise - free samples , or at the software level using dynamically corrected gates .",
    "several theoretical works have employed the latter approach to design higher - fidelity single - qubit gates.@xcite    despite the experimental advance demonstrated in ref .",
    ", theoretical research on improving the fidelity of singlet - triplet two - qubit gates via capacitive coupling has remained rare .",
    "while the inter - qubit coupling term has been individually treated in nmr@xcite , the unavoidable presence of single - qubit terms and their associated errors complicates the problem considerably , making previous approaches inapplicable .",
    "further difficulty arises that capacitive coupling exhibits less symmetry compared with the exchange coupling , preventing one from factorizing the larger two - qubit hilbert space into separate subspaces .",
    "this makes it difficult to adapt ( or generalize ) dynamically corrected gates developed for single - qubit operations@xcite to design a robust two - qubit gate for capacitive coupling as was done in the case of exchange coupling.@xcite still , it has recently been realized that one may systematically generate entangling gates with capacitive coupling which are equivalent to the well - known cnot gate by using a single square pulse.@xcite in addition , the decoherence mechanisms relevant for the protocol implemented in ref .",
    "have been further investigated in ref .  .",
    "however , a systematic way of performing two - qubit gate operations that are robust against noise is still an important open question . here",
    ", we address this issue by showing that minor , precise modifications to the sequence already experimentally implemented in ref .",
    "can further cancel the effects of noise and significantly enhance the two - qubit gate fidelity .",
    "we start with the simpler case in which the magnetic field gradient is much smaller than the control field ; using the results we obtain in this limit as a guide , we then solve the problem for more general parameter regimes .",
    "we show how to systematically generate pulse sequences that implement entangling two - qubit gates while suppressing both nuclear and charge noise errors by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we consider two singlet - triplet qubits ( labelled by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) coupled capacitively .",
    "the hamiltonian reads@xcite @xmath2 here , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the exchange interaction between the two spins on qubit @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and determines the rate of single - qubit @xmath5-rotations .",
    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the magnetic field gradient enabling single - qubit @xmath8-rotations .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the capacitive coupling between the two qubits which creates entanglement , and is typically much smaller than @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in practice ,",
    "the exchange interactions are controlled by the bias voltages ( detunings ) applied to each qubit , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "one can similarly write @xmath12 where @xmath13 may be defined as a linear combination of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the evolution under the hamiltonian , eq .  , for time @xmath16 is thus a two - qubit gate denoted as : @xmath17    similarly to the single - qubit case , the evolution of two qubits is subject to two noise channels . in the case where the qubits are in semiconductors like gaas,@xcite",
    "the nuclear noise arises from the flip - flops of surrounding nuclear spins mediated by the hyperfine interaction with the electron spins in the quantum dots , which changes @xmath6 to @xmath18 and @xmath7 to @xmath19 ( ref .  ) . on the other hand ,",
    "charged impurities near the confined electrons lead to fluctuations of the confinement potential and consequently the exchange interaction .",
    "the shift in the exchange interaction can be expressed as @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is determined by the dependence of @xmath24 on the detuning @xmath25 ( ref .  ) .",
    "together these errors give rise to inaccuracies in the resulting two - qubit quantum gates , namely @xmath26 with @xmath27 dependent on the @xmath28 s and @xmath29 s .",
    "the goal of this paper is to reduce the effect of noise ( i.e. @xmath27 ) using optimized pulse sequences . in this work",
    "we also make the static noise approximation , namely the @xmath28 s and @xmath29 s are assumed to be unknown constants for a given run of a quantum gate , but may change from one run to the next .",
    "the static noise approximation is valid in most experimental spin qubit situations since the electrically controlled gate operations can typically be very fast compared with the slow noise fluctuations in the environment.@xcite for spin qubits in silicon , the nuclear noise is absent and one has only charge noise to deal with.@xcite our results are applicable in this case as well .    the explicit analytical form of eq",
    ".   for arbitrary parameters is complicated and involves solutions to a quartic eigenequation ( see methods ) , making it difficult to find pulse sequences which implement well - known entangling gates such as the cnot . in ref .",
    ", a two - qubit gate was experimentally demonstrated by employing a `` simultaneous dynamical decoupling '' sequence given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and one makes the approximation that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are much weaker compared to the control fields and are thus negligible when those fields are pulsed on .",
    "the resulting gate has a particularly useful anti - diagonal form .",
    "one typically uses the makhlin invariants@xcite to classify two - qubit gates such that two gates with identical invariants may be converted into each other using only single - qubit ( local ) operations .",
    "the makhlin invariants for eq .",
    "are @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for @xmath34 with @xmath35 an odd integer , it is equivalent to cnot ( @xmath36 ) up to local operations .        in this paper",
    ", we start from eq .   and show how one can reduce the gate error due to nuclear noise and charge noise .",
    "for the first half of our results , we make the same assumption @xmath37,@xmath9 that has been utilized and verified in experiments.@xcite in this relatively simple case , we show that one may construct dynamically corrected two - qubit gates in an intuitive way .",
    "later on , we discuss the more complicated yet practical case with nonzero @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where it is harder to gain intuition even in the absence of noise , and extra work is needed to ensure the equivalence between the outcome of the pulse sequence and the desired two - qubit gate ( cnot ) by direct evaluation of the makhlin invariants .",
    "nevertheless , we explicitly demonstrate that pulse sequences can be constructed in this demanding situation as well using constrained numerical optimization techniques that start from the solution to the simpler @xmath38 case .",
    "we also make a few nonessential assumptions for the purpose of presentation .",
    "we show results for `` symmetric '' pulsing , namely @xmath39 and @xmath40 . regarding the charge noise",
    ", we assume the empirical form@xcite @xmath41 so that @xmath42 , and similarly @xmath43 .",
    "for the capacitive coupling @xmath9 , the mechanism of charge noise is different than for individual qubits . while in ref .",
    "it has been argued empirically that @xmath44 , no microscopic calculation of this relationship has appeared in the literature , and the precise form is likely sample - dependent .",
    "we therefore assume the simple form @xmath45 .",
    "while we make these assumptions because concrete parameter values are needed in evaluating the performance of the gates , we emphasise that the applicability of our method does not depend in any way on these assumptions . in fact",
    ", all these restrictions can be lifted either by modifying the cost function or altering the parameters used in the numerical search .",
    "for example , deviations from the assumed exponential model of charge noise may easily be accommodated according to the method presented in ref .  .",
    "we write the evolution operator , eq .",
    ", under nuclear noise @xmath47 and @xmath48 as @xmath49 we also define the noise - free component of eq .",
    "[ eq : one - piecewdh ] as @xmath50 , shown as the first quantum circuit in fig .  [ fig : dhonly](a ) . for @xmath46 , the expansion of eq .",
    "to first order in @xmath28 only contains terms proportional to @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as is clear from the methods section . for this particular case ,",
    "the explicit form of these error terms is simple enough to be obtained analytically .",
    "we write the first order error terms as ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 and for a given @xmath57 value , the coefficients on the right hand side of eq .",
    "are only functions of @xmath58 .",
    "since experimentally it is easy to vary @xmath24 , it then makes sense to choose a value which minimizes the error .",
    "therefore we reiterate the problem as a constrained optimization problem : given the cost function @xmath59 and the constraint that @xmath60 ( which is the physical regime where experiments operate@xcite ) , find the value of @xmath24 which minimizes @xmath61 . to simplify expressions of cost functions to be discussed later , we define the `` norm '' of a @xmath62 matrix @xmath63 projected onto the 16-dimensional two - qubit pauli basis as @xmath64^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath65 run over @xmath66 while @xmath67",
    ". then @xmath68 here we use the norm of the `` error vector '' in place of the infidelity because the latter requires input of the noise amplitude which we assume to be an unknown constant for a given run .",
    "we show @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dhonly](b ) .",
    "@xmath61 has multiple minima , and one can choose the minimum which is most practical for a specific experiment . since the curve does not have sharp dips at the minima , even if one is a little off from the optimal value one should still expect error reduction .",

    "[ all curves shown in fig .",

    "because there is only one instance of the evolution operator @xmath73 appearing on each side of the @xmath8-rotations , we term the sequence as `` level-1 '' .",
    "we see that if one simply changes @xmath24 to the value @xmath74 , the sequence already offers an additional error reduction by two orders of magnitude . even if we can not cancel the first - order @xmath28 error entirely , as is evident from the equal slopes of the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dhonly](c ) , this reduction in error is already substantial , and it only requires a simple alteration in existing experiments ( just changing the @xmath24 value )",

    "we also note that while @xmath9 is assumed to be held constant in producing the figure , our method can easily be adapted to more general situations that can include nontrivial relations between @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",

    "the added flexibility afforded by @xmath131 is not only beneficial in experiments where one type of noise dominates over the other , but also in situations where one wishes to simultaneously employ alternative methods for suppressing noise , such as bayesian estimation @xcite .",
    "the method presented here can be easily extended to generate entangling gates other than cnot or applied to systems other than the singlet - triplet qubits discussed here .",

    "very recent experiments in double - quantum - dot charge qubits have demonstrated a cnot gate with a fidelity comparable to that obtained for singlet - triplet spin qubits,@xcite and the coupling hamiltonian is identical to eq .",
    "when @xmath135 are interpreted as the energy splittings between charge states and @xmath136 as the inter - dot tunnelings . in this case , the energy splittings are no longer constrained to be strictly positive , and their dependence on the detuning is typically linear .",
    "these differences can easily be incorporated into our optimization procedure , and all the analysis presented here , including the structure of the pulse sequences , remains the same .",
    "we further note that our method may be generalized to produce noise - suppressing pulse sequences for other types of qubits , such as the exchange - only qubit or the resonant - exchange qubit,@xcite as well as the hybrid qubit demonstrated recently,@xcite which can be coupled capacitively .",
    "we also emphasise that several assumptions that we have made for the purposes of presentation , including symmetric pulsing and the exponential charge noise model , can easily be lifted to address more general situations .",
    "for example , asymmetric pulsing may be treated by adding search parameters , while for a general charge noise model the sequence of eq",
    ".   still holds as long as the auxiliary angle @xmath137 is determined by the actual amplitude errors of @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "discussions for similar cases in exchange - coupled qubits may be found in ref .  .",
    "ref .   also treats a case where the static - noise approximation is lifted , and has found that as long as the noise is concentrated at low frequencies , dynamically corrected single - qubit gates work fine . in future work , it would be interesting to map out precisely the types of noise spectra for which our two - qubit gates do and do not work well , although it will be computationally much more expensive than in the case of single - qubit gates .",
    "precise , error - free entangling gate operations on coupled qubits is currently the bottleneck for scalable quantum computation using solid state spin qubits .",
    "our results show how to reduce both nuclear noise and charge noise while at the same time offering the advantage that the sequences are simple enough for immediate experimental implementation .",

    "<S> these protocols are obtained by making simple modifications to control sequences already used in the laboratory and should thus be easy enough for immediate experimental realization . together with existing control protocols for robust single - qubit gates , our results constitute an important step toward scalable quantum computation using spin qubits in semiconductor platforms . </S>"
