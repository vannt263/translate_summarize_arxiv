    "adaptive isogeometric methods ( aigm ) have gained widespread interest and are a very active field of research , investigating a wide range of refinement strategies .",
    "the `` usual '' mesh refinement , entitled @xmath0-refinement , currently competes with @xmath1-refinement ( augmenting the polynomial degree ) , @xmath2-refinement ( a particular combination of @xmath0- and @xmath1-refinement ) , @xmath3-refinement ( redesigning the mesh ) and their combinations . however , if b - splines or nurbs are considered as a basis , their tensor product nature will prohibit a truly local @xmath0-refinement within a single patch , and various approaches have been developed to overcome this restrictive tensor product structure .    the concept of t - splines as an @xmath0-refinement technique caught much attention @xcite , but also incorporated algorithmic difficulties @xcite , in particular linear dependencies between the t - spline functions that should serve as a spline basis , and an unclear nesting behaviour of the generated spline spaces .",
    "most of these problems could be solved in the last years @xcite .",
    "hierarchical ( h)b - splines , a further promising @xmath0-refinement technique , have been introduced already in 1988 @xcite and developed to meet the requirements of isogeometric analysis @xcite .",
    "they have been enhanced to truncated hierarchical ( th)b - splines @xcite by reducing the interaction between basis functions of different refinement levels . as a result ,",
    "thb - splines improve the conditioning and reduce the bandwidth as well as the total number of non - zero entries in the system matrices @xcite",
    ". the mentioned interaction can be further regulated by the introduction of @xmath4-admissible meshes , where interacting basis functions in an element belong to at most @xmath4 different levels @xcite .",
    "further @xmath0-refinement techniques are locally refined ( lr-)b - splines @xcite , hierarchical t - splines @xcite , modified t - splines @xcite , pht - splines @xcite amongst many others .    ) . ]    in this contribution , four different realizations of an adaptive isogeometric method with @xmath0-refinement are compared :    1 .   a refinement based on t - splines @xcite , where the refinement process is divided into two steps . at first",
    ", marked elements are refined , and secondly , an additional refinement is processed to recover the linear independence of the t - spline functions , called _ analysis - suitability_. 2 .   a refinement based on t - splines @xcite , where also the vicinity of the marked elements is considered . by defining a class of admissible t - meshes",
    ", the proposed refinement preserves the analysis - suitability of the t - splines directly .",
    "3 .   a refinement based on thb - splines , where the mesh allows only a one - level difference between neighbouring mesh elements . 4 .   a refinement based on thb - splines , where only 2-admissible meshes are allowed .",
    "we refer to these methods as _ greedy refinement _",
    "( method 1 and 3 ) and _ safe refinement _ ( method 2 and 4 ) .",
    "some of these methods allow for a mathematical proof of linear complexity @xcite .",
    "together with results on the convergence of the adaptive algorithm @xcite , this allows for a proof of optimal convergence rates @xcite .",
    "this paper will compare the refinement of t - splines and thb - splines with a focus on the influence of the different mesh classes on the numerical solution and properties . in four examples , including singular and non - singular problems of linear elasticity and the poisson problem , the h1-errors of the discrete solutions , the number of degrees of freedom as well as sparsity patterns and condition numbers of the discretized problem are compared .    to enable a unified implementation of the different refinement techniques , b ' ezier extraction is used .",
    "b ' ezier extraction provides a canonical form to use isogeometric analysis with different spline bases , has a strict element viewpoint , allows for an implementation into existing finite element codes and has been already developed for t - splines @xcite and thb - splines @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : heatconductionlshape_2 ]  ( c ) ) is of interest .",
    "it can be seen that for the same order of accuracy , all local refinement techniques produce smaller condition numbers compared to the uniform case .",
    "this means , that for local refinement , the error of the solution decreases faster per dof than the condition number increases per dof .",
    "this is an important result , because it illustrates that the negative influence of a locally refined mesh on the condition number does not predominate the benefits of local refinement regarding the error level .",
    "the refinement strategies compared among themselves show similar results .",

    "a reason for this behaviour can be found again in the relatively coarse initial mesh , which forces the safe t - spline refinement to refine almost the whole domain in the first refinement steps . as a result ,",
    "the safe t - spline refinement requires six times more degrees of freedom than the greedy t - spline refinement for the same error level .    the condition number is plotted over the dof in figure  [ fig : heatconductionsd_2 ]  ( b ) . due to the badly shaped elements , the condition number for the greedy t - spline refinement increases fastest .",
    "the thb - spline refinements instead seem to benefit from their hierarchical structure together with the absence of a deforming geometry mapping . at a certain stage of refinement",
