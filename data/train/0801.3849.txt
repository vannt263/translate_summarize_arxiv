    "following the initial recognition by @xcite that the nucleus of the prototypical type  2 seyfert galaxy ngc  1068 must be surrounded by a toroidal belt of gas and dust , a tremendous amount of evidence has accumulated in support of the idea that similar obscuring tori surround the nuclei of other type  2 seyfert galaxies ( as reviewed , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry ( the method originally employed by antonucci and miller ) applied to both type  2 seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies @xcite often reveals in polarized light broad optical / uv emission lines and a strong non - stellar continuum that are essentially invisible in the total flux spectrum . in many examples of both these types of agn , conical regions of bright line emission from highly - ionized elements point at the otherwise obscured nucleus @xcite .",
    "similarly , both type  2 seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies often exhibit x - ray continua that either show evidence for very large column densities of material along the line of sight or are extremely weak , likely indicating that the obscuration is compton thick @xcite . in two cases ,",
    "ngc  1068 and the circinus galaxy , the obscuring torus can be seen directly in interferometric infrared imaging @xcite .",
    "the principal effect of this toroidal obscuration is that observers trying to see the nucleus along lines of sight that pass through it are prevented from seeing anything but dust - reprocessed infrared continuum and ( perhaps ) hard x - rays .",
    "consequently , most of the classic signatures of agn  broad optical / uv emission lines , strong optical / uv non - stellar continuum , strong x - ray continuum  are obliterated when the object is seen from such a direction .",
    "only when the line of sight passes through the central hole of the torus can all these features be seen , and the object is perceived as a type  1 agn .    in the nearby universe , where we can see large numbers of low luminosity agn ,",
    "large statistical samples have been assembled in order to measure the luminosity functions of both type  1 and type  2 agn .",
    "ideally compared at matched bolometric luminosity , but more often in terms of their luminosity in a single band or feature , the ratio of their numbers can be immediately interpreted as the ratio of unobscured to obscured solid angle .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite , using samples of optically - selected agn from the sloan digital sky survey , found that the ratio of type  1 objects to type  2 objects increases with increasing luminosity , from @xmath9 at an [ oiii ]  5007 luminosity of @xmath10 to @xmath11 for line luminosities @xmath12 . using samples of x - ray selected agn , @xcite and @xcite argued for a similar shift in the ratio of unobscured to obscured , suggesting that the unobscured variety come to dominate the total population for 28  kev luminosity @xmath13  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite , @xcite and others , also using x - ray selected agn samples .",
    "in fact , hints of such a trend were already seen in the much smaller 3cr radio sample @xcite .",
    "however , there remain significant uncertainties in the measured population ratio at high luminosity .",
    "for example , compton - thick agn are completely missing from x - ray - selected samples .",
    "other sample construction methods ( e.g. , the very large sample of type  2 quasars selected from the sdss based primarily on [ oiii ] emission by @xcite ) can potentially yield quantitative estimates of comparative luminosity functions , but require substantial work in order to turn catalogs into space densities . although much effort has been made in the last few years to construct agn samples from mid - infrared observations with the _ spitzer space telescope _ , the selection effects remain too poorly understood and the sample size is sometimes too small to permit extraction of a trend in the type ratio as a function of luminosity @xcite .    here",
    "we attempt a different approach to the problem of measuring the unobscured / obscured ratio : using the ratio of reradiated mid - infrared continuum to bolometric luminosity in type  1 agn as a surrogate ( cf . the suggestions in @xcite ) . because the obscuration transforms essentially all the nuclear radiation incident upon it into mid - infrared continuum via dust reradiation , and detailed radiation transfer calculations suggest that most of that continuum is radiated toward observers in the type  1 direction no matter what the detailed arrangement of dust may be @xcite",
    ", this ratio should give a good indicator of the ratio of unobscured / obscured solid angle .",
    "the relative ease of identifying type  1 agn across a wide dynamic range in luminosity also gives this method a number of advantages relative to those dependent on actually counting type  2 objects .",
    "@xcite have recently made an effort to implement this program , but the details of their method differ in significant ways from ours ; we will comment on specific contrasts as they arise .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section ",
    "2 we present the selection criteria and basic observational properties of the sources used in this work . in section ",
    "3 we study the correlations found in this sample , while the significance and interpretation of these trends are discussed in  4 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in  5 .",
    "when required , we assume a @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15=0.71 , @xmath16=0.3 and @xmath17=0.7 , in agreement with the most recent cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "in order to eliminate any possibility that what we find involves an evolutionary effect rather than a luminosity dependence , we chose a sample of agn that all have nearly the same redshift ( @xmath18 ) , in contrast with the @xcite sample which includes sources at all redshifts .",
    "this particular redshift is a convenient choice because it is large enough that luminous quasars were common , but not so large that low luminosity agn are too faint to detect . to achieve the greatest possible dynamic range in luminosity , we made use of three samples with complementary properties : one that has very large solid angle but is relatively shallow ( sloan digital sky survey : sdss ) , one that has smaller solid angle but goes deeper ( great observatories origins deep survey : goods ) and one intermediate approach ( cosmic evolution survey : cosmos ) .    for our infrared band",
    ", we used the spitzer space telescope mips @xmath19 m channel .",
    "the corresponding rest - frame wavelengths are @xmath2012@xmath3 m ; by requiring @xmath1@xmath211.2 , we avoid most of the contamination from the @xmath22 m silicate feature . for the highest redshift sources ,",
    "this silicate feature can influence our 24@xmath3 m photometry , however this will affect only a small fraction of our sample .",
    "in addition , at this relatively short wavelength , stellar - heated dust is usually relatively faint . from the composite qso spectrum with individually detected pah features of schweitzer et al .",
    "( 2006 ; figure 2 top panel ) , we can estimate the fraction of integrated flux contributed by the 11.3 @xmath3 m pah feature in the mips 24 micron band at 0.8@xmath23@xmath1@xmath231.2 , and we find a maximum contribution of only @xmath24 ; hence this contribution is completely negligible .",
    "moreover , because we use only unobscured agn with @xmath4 from 10@xmath5 to 10@xmath25 ergs  s@xmath8 , stellar heating is unlikely to be a significant contaminant .",
    "the agn from the sdss were selected based on their optical properties , while in the case of the goods and cosmos sources they were x - ray selected . in any case , the selection is completely independent of their infrared properties , so it will not bias our results . in only one case ,",
    "a sdss source is located in the field of view of a spitzer observation , but a counterpart was not detected . in that case , we estimate the corresponding upper limit as described below .    for our indicator of the nuclear luminosity , we used optical and uv ( galex ) data to estimate the bolometric luminosity individually for each source . because the galex nuv band ( 17502800    ) corresponds to 8751900     in the rest - frame , we are able to measure directly the flux in much of the spectral peak region .",
    "the details of our method are presented in  2.5 .",
    "in addition , we have also found it is sometimes convenient to use the sdss i - band luminosity as a standard of comparison because in our redshift range it corresponds to rest - frame b - band .      in order to construct a large sample of high luminosity unobscured quasars",
    ", we used the results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , specifically from data release 5 @xcite .",
    "only sources classified as quasars by the sdss pipeline , and thus presenting high - ionization broad emission lines , were considered .",
    "a detailed description of the sdss quasar classification scheme was presented by @xcite .",
    "there are 11937 sdss / dr5 quasars in the 0.8@xmath21@xmath1@xmath211.2 redshift range .",
    "spitzer data for these sdss quasars were obtained from the archive using the leopard v6.1 software .",
    "a total of 638 astronomical observation requests ( aors ) were found with at least one source in our sample in the field . in many cases , these correspond to different observations of the same field , so only 206 quasars in our sdss / dr5 sample were observed by spitzer / mips .",
    "only the post - bcd ( basic calibrated data ) frames for each aor were downloaded .",
    "the mosaicking and point - source extraction ( mopex ; @xcite ) package version 030106 was used in order to extract the sources and calculate fluxes from each aor . the procedure described by @xcite , was followed .",
    "briefly , we did a first pass extraction including the brightest sources only , in order to calculate the point response function ( prf ) for each mosaic . using this specific prf we then extracted sources with a signal - to - noise higher than 5 . in the last step , the flux for each source was estimated by performing prf fitting . in order to check this procedure , we downloaded the data from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; @xcite ) and compared the results obtained by following this procedure with those reported by the legacy survey team .",
    "the flux densities presented in the goods catalog were converted into fluxes assuming a mips-24 bandwidth of 4.7  @xmath3 m , as reported by the mips data handbook .",
    "we found very good agreement between the two independent studies . on average ,",
    "the fluxes reported by the goods team were higher by @xmath26 with a spread of less than @xmath210% , even after incorporating an aperture correction . given that this small offset will not affect our results , we do not apply any correction to our fluxes .",
    "the sdss sample was then matched to the sources found in the spitzer archive , using a maximum search radius of 10@xmath27 .",
    "this maximum nominal separation was chosen both to minimize the number of false counterparts and to take into account the positional uncertainties of both spitzer and sdss .",
    "altogether , we found in these spitzer images counterparts for 205 sources at a signal to noise higher than 5 . in the remaining case , sdss j024256.93 - 001558.0 ,",
    "a very faint counterpart is visible on the spitzer image , but not significantly detected so we calculate a 3-@xmath28 upper limit from the background standard deviation measured around the sdss position . the distribution of distances between the sdss position and the spitzer counterpart can be seen in figure  [ dist_hist ] . the average separation between the optical position and the ir counterpart was @xmath20.5@xmath27 .",
    "for each sdss source , we calculated the probability of a false match with a 24  @xmath3 m counterpart , assuming a poissonian distribution of sources and the source density of the corresponding aor .",
    "we found that the maximum probability of a false match for a given source was @xmath29 , with an average probability of 0.02% .",

    "optical magnitudes in the ab system were obtained directly from the reported sdss values . in all cases ,",
    "the psf fitting magnitude was used , as suggested by the sdss team for sources that are unresolved at ground - based resolution . although the errors in the sdss photometry are negligible , since these are all relatively bright optical sources , errors in the mips-24  @xmath3 m photometry are estimated to be @xmath210@xmath32 , including both measurement and systematic ( @xmath33 according to the mips data handbook ) uncertainties .      in order to study lower luminosity sources , we include sources detected in both the north and south goods fields .",
    "a summary of the properties of these sources was presented by @xcite .",
    "our selection criteria were the same as for the sdss sample : unobscured sources and 0.8@xmath23@xmath1@xmath231.2 . in this case , a source was classified as unobscured if broad lines were present in the optical spectrum and the equivalent hydrogen column density of obscuration @xmath34 in the x - ray spectrum was smaller than @xmath35  @xmath36 . with these criteria , we found a total of 10 sources , 4 from the goods - n and 6 from the goods - s fields .",

    ", we looked for uv counterparts in a 10@xmath27 radius around the optical position .",
    "the median separation over the whole sample was much less than the maximum permitted , @xmath200.5@xmath27 , and the actual maximum separation was only 3.5@xmath27 .",
    "170 of the 206 sources in the sdss sample were detected in at least one of the galex bands , for a detection rate of 83% .",
    "of these 170 sources , 61 were detected only in the reddest nuv band and 4 detected only in the fuv band .",
    "the galex properties of the sdss sources are presented in table  [ prop_sdss ] .",
    "galex coverage of both goods fields is significantly deeper . whereas the all - sky survey exposure time was only 0.1  ksec , the north field",
    "is being observed for 100  ksec as part of the deep imaging survey , and the south field is being observed for 200  ksec as part of the ultra - deep imaging survey . at the time of data",
    "release  2 , the total time spent on the south field was only @xmath276  ksec , while @xmath295  ksec had been accumulated in the north field .",
    "consequently , only 4 of the 6 sources in the south field were detected by galex , but all the sources in the north field have a uv counterpart . in table  [ prop_goods ] , we present the galex properties of the goods sources .",
    "the entire cosmos field is one of the targets of the galex ultra - deep imaging survey .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that all the sources in our sample with spitzer - mips detections were also detected in the galex observations .",
    "the uv properties of the cosmos sources are presented in table  [ prop_cosmos ] .      because we believe the infrared continuum to be the result of reprocessing shorter wavelength radiation from the nucleus that strikes the dusty torus , including it in our estimate of the intrinsic nuclear bolometric luminosity when we have an unobscured view of the nucleus",
    "would be double - counting .",
    "instead , we do the best we can to sum all flux from wavelengths shorter than @xmath21@xmath3 m ; the exact long wavelength cut - off is not important because the integral is in general dominated by the uv . we neglect x - ray contributions , but these are generally small , @xmath45 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to estimate the bolometric luminosities , we combined the photometric information from galex nuv ( 17502800  ) to @xmath1-band ( @xmath21@xmath3 m ) . in the optical range , where there are only very small gaps in wavelength between the available photometric bands , we approximate the integrated luminosity by the sum of the observed luminosity in each band . for uv fluxes ,",
    "we employ galex data wherever possible .",
    "specifically , we use the galex nuv channel , which for our sample translates to rest - frame wavelengths 8751400    .",
    "whenever the object was either not observed by galex , or has only an upper bound , we estimate the flux in the nuv band by extrapolating from the bluest filter available ( @xmath46-band for cosmos and @xmath47-band for goods ) using the median quasar sed from @xcite.both because galex data are missing from only a small fraction of our sample and because the intrinsic dispersion in bolometric corrections is @xmath48 @xcite , this extrapolation should not bias significantly our results . to account for the gap between the @xmath46 band ( rest - frame @xmath49    ) and the galex nuv band , we linearly interpolate in @xmath50 . at even shorter wavelengths , which are often not accessible in direct observations , we assume a power - law spectrum ( @xmath51 ) with slope @xmath52 , as reported by @xcite in the 5001200     regime .",
    "the amplitude of this power law is fixed by matching to either the galex photometry ( when available ) or the extrapolated flux from the sdss composite spectrum when galex data are not available . from the templates of @xcite , we estimate that @xmath220% of the bolometric luminosity is emitted in this wavelength range .",
    "the approach described above incorporates all the available information in the optical - uv range .",
    "in contrast , @xcite computed bolometric luminosities by multiplying the observed rest - frame 5100     luminosity by a fixed bolometric correction .",
    "our central result is shown in figure  [ 24_bol ] . there",
    "we plot the ratio of mips 24  @xmath3 m luminosity , @xmath53 , to our estimate of the bolometric luminosity , @xmath4 , of each individual object .",
    "two properties of the data are immediately apparent from this figure : that the mean value of this ratio decreases by order unity over the factor of 300 range in luminosity these data span ; and that at any single luminosity there is a very large dispersion .",
    "m to bolometric luminosity as a function of bolometric luminosity for all the sources in the sample .",
    "the open circles show the ratio for sources not detected by galex .",
    "triangles with error bars show the average value in each luminosity bin , with 1-@xmath28 vertical error bars.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    although @xmath54 does change over this range of bolometric luminosities , it is not by a large factor : a factor of 3 is the best estimate .",
    "this figure may be compared with the factor of 2 contrast given by the fitting formula of @xcite , meant to describe the sample means from @xmath55    @xmath56  ergs  s@xmath8 to 10@xmath25  ergs  s@xmath8 , a somewhat greater dynamic range than spanned by our sample .",
    "nonetheless , our sample size is large enough for the bin - means to be quite narrowly - defined , and the trend is clearly significant .",
    "several statistical tests support this conclusion .",
    "to evaluate the significance in difference between the mean values in the two bins with the largest number of sample points ( the second and third highest in luminosity ) , we apply student s t - test ; it shows that they are different at the @xmath57 significance level , while the means of the highest and the third highest luminosity bins are different at the 10@xmath58 level .",
    "similarly , the spearman rank - correlation test finds that the correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 is significant at the 10@xmath61 level .",
    "a conventional pearson correlation test fails on these data because there are so many more sdss quasars than cosmos and goods sources , and the contrast in the mean infrared / bolometric luminosity across the narrower range of luminosity where most of the sdss quasars are found is relatively small .    at the same time",
    ", the dispersion is very large . considered in logarithmic terms , the rms fluctuation within the bins is 0.250.35 , equivalent to a multiplicative factor of 1.82.2 , comparable to the contrast in the mean across our entire luminosity range .    that this trend ( and large dispersion ) is not related to effects in the intrinsic spectra of agn",
    "can be seen by considering two other flux ratios as functions of @xmath4 ( fig .",

    "the magnitude of the error induced by using a fixed bolometric correction to estimate bolometric luminosities from a given optical band is shown by the dispersion of the points plotted in both panels of figure  [ nuv_bol ] .",
    "use of the i - band and a fixed bolometric correction , for example , entails an uncertainty in the bolometric luminosity of @xmath68 .",
    "just as it is possible that the physics controlling the geometry of obscuration is correlated in some way with the bolometric luminosity of the agn , so too , it may change as a function of the age of the universe .",
    "there is evidence , for example , that at fixed luminosity , @xmath0 increases with increasing redshift @xcite ; this suggestion , however , remains controversial ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "factoring out any possible redshift - dependence was a strong motivating factor for our choice of a sample in which all the objects have approximately the same @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the precise character of the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 also enters into the debate over the possible dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "currently - available samples that probe to high redshift are in general strongly incomplete at low luminosity because it is so difficult to obtain spectra for objects that faint . if one s estimate of the obscured fraction at high redshift is based solely on the detectable sources ( which are , of course , high luminosity objects ) , it will be biased to a low value if @xmath0 systematically declines with increasing luminosity at all redshifts .",
    "as we explained earlier , the ratio of infrared reprocessed light to bolometric luminosity should increase as the fraction of solid angle occupied by the dusty obscuring gas @xmath69 increases .",
    "if the reprocessed ir were radiated isotropically , the ratio @xmath64 would be proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "it is much more likely , however , that the reradiation is anisotropic .",
    "consequently , the relationship between these two quantities is not necessarily precisely linear , nor does it directly yield @xmath0 without the introduction of any additional parameters ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . at the very least ( i.e. , in the event of isotropic radiation )",
    ", there is a proportionality constant to be determined .    at present , there are two lines of evidence regarding the directionality of the reradiated ir . on the observational side ,",
    "there are suggestions that it may not be far from isotropic @xcite . in both of these studies ,",
    "it is claimed on the basis of small samples of agn that the mean ratio of mid - ir flux to intrinsic hard x - ray flux is the same for both obscured and unobscured objects .",
    "however , in both of these studies , the intrinsic hard x - ray luminosities of the obscured objects are in general substantially smaller ( by at least an order of magnitude ) than those of the unobscured objects . given the correlation we have found between @xmath64 and @xmath4 , one might then have expected that in their samples the mid - ir to x - ray flux ratio would be even _ higher _ for the obscured than for the unobscured if the ir radiation were isotropic .",
    "we therefore do not regard these studies as making a strong case for isotropic radiation .",
    "on the other hand , there are strong physical and theoretical arguments for thinking that the radiation is anisotropic .",
    "the obscuration is , after all , strongly aspherical ",
    "if it were otherwise , there would be very few unobscured objects to see .",
    "if the torus is optically thick in the radial direction in the mid - ir and that optical depth is larger than the vertical optical depth , most of the mid - ir flux should escape roughly parallel to the torus axis , with rather less escaping in the equatorial direction .",
    "every detailed radiation transfer model published shows this tendency , although the precise contrast between the @xmath70 m flux toward the pole and toward the equator varies depending on the details of the adopted density distribution @xcite .",
    "the most recent paper ( which presents both smooth and clumpy models ) finds ratios between the total infrared flux in the equatorial plane and at @xmath71 from the axis to vary between 0.06 and 0.3 , depending on the specific model . making the approximation that very little flux",
    "is directed toward observers in the obscured solid angle , we expect that the mips - band luminosity should scale relative to the bolometric luminosity approximately as @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the fraction of the total dust - reprocessed luminosity falling within the mips band ( @xmath74@xmath75 m in the rest - frame at @xmath76 ) . even within the range of viewing angles @xmath77 that provide an unobscured view , we may expect order unity variations in this quantity .    to confirm this scaling and estimate @xmath73 , we studied the results of a number of model calculations .",
    "these models were performed with the code described in @xcite .",
    "for all of them , the obscuration was assumed to be confined to within a constant opening - angle spherical wedge whose outer radius was 30 times greater than its inner radius .",
    "we considered two density profiles : a single constant value and a radial decay @xmath78@xmath79 .",
    "for both density models , when the torus is optically thick in the mid - infrared , the approximate model given by equation  1 is confirmed provided the opening angle is at least @xmath200.7  radians . crudely speaking",
    ", the solid angle - weighted mean value of @xmath80 ( for viewing angles permitting an unobscured view of the nucleus ) does not vary a great deal with torus opening angle : it varies from @xmath200.06 to @xmath200.08 depending on the model details for the same range of opening angles for which equation  1 holds . when the opening angle becomes smaller than this",
    ", @xmath80 can begin to diminish , with the amount sensitive to whether the torus is truly a spherical wedge or has a flatter outer envelope . at fixed opening angle",
    ", @xmath80 does vary somewhat with viewing angle , typically being perhaps @xmath81 greater than the mean for nearly polar viewing angle and dropping sharply when the viewing angle becomes close to the torus opening angle .",
    "the latter effect is also sensitive to the specific geometry ( spherical wedge ) adopted in these models , which also depends slightly on the wavelength of the emission .",
    "the ratio of ir flux to bolometric seen by an observer in the unobscured direction is then @xmath82 to this level of approximation , the obscured fraction associated with a given value of @xmath64 is    @xmath83    where @xmath84    using the solid angle - weighted means of @xmath80 taken from our models , we can transform the bin - means of @xmath64 shown in figure  [ 24_bol ] to estimates of @xmath0 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ obs_frac ] .",
    "it appears that the mean value of @xmath0 falls from @xmath85 at the lowest bolometric luminosities in our sample to @xmath860.4 at the highest luminosities .",
    "_ we strongly caution , however , that there may be a systematic error of order unity in @xmath87 due to the specific assumptions made in those models regarding the density distribution within the envelope that determines @xmath0 . a variety of parameters ( e.g. , the ratio of outer radius to inner , the degree of inhomogeneity and clumping , etc . )",
    "may quantitatively alter @xmath87 .",
    "_    we compare this dependence of the mean @xmath0 as a function of @xmath4 with the relation that has been found in x - ray studies in figure  [ obs_frac ] .",
    "for this figure we use the x - ray sample of @xcite , with the x - ray luminosity transformed to @xmath4 using the luminosity - dependent bolometric corrections of @xcite .",
    "the level of agreement between the two independent methods of inferring @xmath0 is surprisingly good , considering the systematic errors in both .",
    "most notably , x - ray surveys completely miss objects with column densities @xmath88  @xmath36 , and there are indications that these objects may be numerous @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if one wished to extend credence to the somewhat larger @xmath0 found by the infrared method at intermediate luminosities , it might be explained by a somewhat larger proportion of compton - thick objects within the population .",
    "it is also interesting that , as pointed out by @xcite , the values of @xmath0 derived from x - ray surveys include the effects of obscuration by both dust and gas , while the ir - derived values include only obscuration by dust .    :",
    "black curve with error bars from x - ray data , as described in the text ; triangles with error bars from the method of this paper assuming values of @xmath80=0.06 ( squares ; red in electronic version ) and 0.08 ( triangles ; blue in electronic version ; displaced by @xmath89@xmath4=0.1 for clarity ) .",
    "the horizontal error bars simply describe the width of the luminosity bin ; the vertical red and blue error bars are dashed to indicate that they are model - dependent in the sense discussed in the text .",
    "their extent was determined by translating the error bars of fig .",
    "[ 24_bol ] using eqn .",
    "[ eq : fobsc].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to close this subsection , we remark on another distinction that may be important in evaluating the meaning of the @xmath0 estimated from @xmath64 .",
    "it is possible for obscuring matter of smaller optical depth to intercept some of the nuclear light farther out in the host galaxy and reradiate it in the mid - infrared even though this matter is wholly independent of the  obscuring torus \" proper ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "molecular clouds and other gas concentrations in the host have at most modest column densities when measured in terms of x - ray absorption ( generally @xmath90  @xmath36 ) , but such column densities can still absorb large portions of an agn s optical / uv continuum .",
    "consequently , they qualify as contributing to @xmath0 both in the sense that they can block our view of the optical / uv light from the nucleus and , depending on their temperature , in terms of their contribution to the mid - infrared luminosity of the system .      one of the virtues of using sdss quasars is that the sample size , particularly for @xmath91  erg  s@xmath92  erg  s@xmath8 , is large enough to be truly statistical . as a result , we can obtain a reasonably reliable estimate of the sample dispersion as well as its mean .",
    "as we have previously remarked , the dispersion is quite large .",
    "we see no measurement error that could contribute in a significant way to the dispersion in @xmath64 at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "the errors in the photometry we use to compute the bolometric luminosity are small , @xmath22% ; the uncertainty in the mips fluxes is @xmath210 - 20% , as detailed in  2.1",
    ".    intrinsic variability could also contribute , but in a similarly minor fashion except perhaps in a very small number of objects .",
    "the time interval between the galex measurements , the sdss photometry , and the spitzer measurements was generally a few years . on that timescale ,",
    "sdss data @xcite show that quasars typically vary by @xmath930.2  mag in the optical , with the larger variability usually occurring at shorter wavelengths and in lower luminosity objects .",
    "a small fraction vary by as much as @xmath94  mag on these timescales , still much smaller than our observed dispersion relative to the mean .",
    "if the infrared is , as we assume , the result of thermal reprocessing by dust , it can not vary substantially on timescales shorter than several to ten years .    according to the results of @xcite ,",
    "the contribution of star formation to the total light in quasars is @xmath95 at far - ir wavelengths , in agreement with the results of @xcite , who found a contribution of @xmath96 at 70  @xmath3 m and @xmath26 at 24  @xmath3 m .",
    "hence , extrapolating linearly to the mips band , we expect a contribution of star formation to the total ir light of @xmath97 at rest - frame 12  @xmath3 m ; we therefore do not expect our results to be significantly affected by star formation processes in the host galaxy . in addition , because @xmath98 is larger for lower luminosity sources than for higher luminosity sources and the nuclear infrared luminosity is @xmath99 , we do not expect the contribution from star formation to increase significantly even at lower luminosities .",
    "there must , therefore , be a genuine large dispersion in @xmath64 .",
    "one possible source of this dispersion is the variation of @xmath80 with viewing angle . again relying on the models described above , a total range of a factor of 23",
    "may be expected from this source alone . compared with our rms logarithmic dispersion of a factor of @xmath22 , or the factor of 100 total range seen in the most - populated bins ,",
    "the expected variations in viewing angle can account for a significant part of this dispersion , but likely not all of it .",
    "this last statement must , of course , be qualified by the condition that our models accurately estimate the range in @xmath73 .",
    "it is entirely possible that changes in the detailed density distribution , even while keeping @xmath0 fixed , might introduce further variations in @xmath73 .",
    "although the expected large optical depth in the @xmath70 m band is likely to limit the sensitivity of @xmath73 to changes in the radial density profile or density inhomogeneities , there could certainly be small , but detectable , quantitative effects .",
    "finally , there may , of course , be additional dispersion due to variations in @xmath69 at fixed luminosity .",
    "it is entirely possible for parameters other than @xmath100 to influence the obscuration s solid angle . among the obvious candidates are the mass of the central mass black hole and the stellar mass contained within the region of the obscuring matter .",
    "the varying impact of magnetic forces , clump collisions , or other mechanisms could also conceivably play a part .      particularly since the launch of the _ spitzer space telescope _ ,",
    "it has become feasible  and worthwhile  to construct samples of agn based on mid - infrared selection @xcite .",
    "our results here demonstrate that the translation between mid - infrared flux and bolometric flux has an intrinsic scatter of a factor of @xmath11 up or down , even for unobscured agn . because , as we have discussed , @xmath66 is generally smaller in obscured agn than in unobscured , the bolometric correction based on infrared flux for them should be an even larger factor , with perhaps greater scatter .",
    "we presented in this paper an alternative way to estimate the fraction of obscured agn and its possible dependence on luminosity , by computing the relative fraction of ir emission in unobscured agn spanning a large of luminosities . using a sample of 206 optically - selected high luminosity agn from the sdss and 24 x - ray selected lower luminosity agn from the goods and cosmos surveys with 0.8@xmath21@xmath1@xmath211.2 ,",
    "nearly all having spitzer detections at 24  @xmath3 m , we found a decrease of a factor of @xmath23 in the relative ir emission at rest - frame 12  @xmath3 m from @xmath4=10@xmath5  ergs  s@xmath8 to 10@xmath25  ergs  s@xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we found a significant scatter of a factor of 23 at a given bolometric luminosity .",
    "some of this scatter can likely be explained by a dependence of the 1113  @xmath3 m fraction @xmath80 on viewing angle ; some may also be due to an intrinsic scatter in @xmath0 at fixed bolometric luminosity due to a dependence on other parameters such as black hole mass , magnetic forces , etc .",
    "using ir re - emission models in order to convert @xmath64 into a fraction of obscured agn , we found that @xmath0 changes from @xmath101 at @xmath102  ergs  s@xmath8 to @xmath103@xmath104 at @xmath105  ergs  s@xmath8 .",
    "the derived dependence of the obscured fraction on luminosity is in good agreement with the direct , but possibly biased ( by the omission of compton - thick objects ) observation of this fraction in x - ray surveys .",
    "we caution , however , that there may be systematic error in the precise values of @xmath0 inferred from @xmath106 because our estimate of @xmath87 is likely to depend somewhat on the details of the density distribution within the torus . nonetheless , it is interesting that in general the values of @xmath0 we infer are larger than what is seen in x - ray surveys .",
    "this contrast hints that there may be a significant population of heavily obscured , even compton thick , agn that are missed in x - ray observations but included in our samples .",

    "<S> recent work has suggested that the fraction of obscured agn declines with increasing luminosity , but it has been difficult to quantify this trend . here , we attempt to measure this fraction as a function of luminosity by studying the ratio of mid - infrared to intrinsic nuclear bolometric luminosity in unobscured agn . because the mid - infrared is created by dust reprocessing of shorter wavelength nuclear light , this ratio is a diagnostic of @xmath0 , the fraction of solid angle around the nucleus covered by obscuring matter . in order to eliminate possible redshift - dependences while also achieving a large dynamic range in luminosity , </S>",
    "<S> we have collected archival 24 micron mips photometry from objects with @xmath1@xmath21 in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) and the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) . to measure the bolometric luminosity for each object , we used archival optical data supplemented by galex data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean ratio of 24  @xmath3 m to bolometric luminosity decreases by a factor of @xmath23 in the @xmath4=10@xmath5 - 3@xmath610@xmath7  ergs  s@xmath8 range , but there is also a large scatter at constant @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> using radiation transfer solutions for model geometries , we show how the ir / bolometric ratio relates to @xmath0 and compare these values with those obtained obtained from samples of x - ray selected agn . </S>",
    "<S> although we find approximate agreement , our method indicates somewhat higher values of @xmath0 , particularly in the middle range of luminosities , suggesting that there may be a significant number of heavily obscured agn missed by x - ray surveys . </S>"
