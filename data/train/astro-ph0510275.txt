    "microlensing is a promising tool for eliciting the properties of massive compact objects in the galactic halo and toward the galactic bulge , and several such observing programs are underway or have been completed .",
    "in particular , the macho and eros projects have published results for several years of monitoring @xmath0 stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; alcock et al .",
    "2000 , milsztajn et al . 2001 ) , which detected @xmath1 events ; and both the macho and ogle projects ( udalski et al .",
    "2000 ) have published the results of microlensing surveys toward the galactic bulge that include more than @xmath2 events .",
    "several additional microlensing surveys are currently underway .",
    "the results of these surveys have provided otherwise inaccessible information on the structure and contents of the galaxy , but not always in unambiguous ways .",
    "the primary object of interest has been the total mass in the form of compact objects , particularly in the ( presumably dark ) galactic halo , usually analyzed in the form of microlensing optical depths originally proposed by paczyski ( 1986 ) .",
    "as useful as these analyses have been , little information on the mass function of the population underlying the microlensing observations has been forthcoming , although some parametric modeling ( e.g. , green 2000 ) has sufficed to indicate some possible constraints conditional upon various kinematic models of the halo .",
    "here we propose a more direct way to elucidate the mass function of the population responsible for microlenses , in the form of a non - parametric statistical model that directly relates the mass function to the microlens quantities being observed . in principle , such a model should allow an unambiguous determination of the mass function , given only the kinematics of the population . in practice , we expect that the information obtainable from such a method will be limited by small number statistics and ambiguities concerning the kinematics of the lensing population .",
    "the necessary microlens physical relations are as follows ( see , e.g. , paczyski 1996 or gould 1996 for more complete discussions ) .",
    "the physical scale of a microlensing event in the lens plane ( i.e. , the plane of the sky at the lens location ) is given by the einstein radius : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , lens and source star distances from the observer ; and @xmath6 is the lens mass .",
    "for solar - mass halo microlenses viewed against the backdrop of the lmc , @xmath7 is typically a few astronomical units . in terms of this quantity ,",
    "the scaled impact parameter @xmath8 and event timescale @xmath9 are defined to be@xmath10 where @xmath11 , the impact parameter , is the closest approach to the lens of the line - of - sight to the source star and @xmath12 is the relative transverse velocity of the encounter , both measured in the lens plane .",

    "can be formally related to that of lens mass among the population from which they were drawn , @xmath16 , by a relation of the form @xmath17 the notation is that @xmath18 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of random variable @xmath19 evaluated at @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the pdf of @xmath19 conditional upon @xmath22 .",
    "the core of the model is the kernel function @xmath23 .",
    "this is essentially an accounting mechanism , one that adds up the probabilities of all possible combinations of lensing parameters @xmath24 that lead to the observed @xmath25 , given mass @xmath6 .",
    "its computation requires the provision of a kinematic model of the lens and source populations ; i.e. , _ a priori _ distributions of @xmath26 .",
    "having computed the kernel , one numerically inverts the statistical model ( eq .",
    "[ [ m1 ] ] ) in terms of the observed @xmath27 to determine the desired mass function characterizing the population producing the microlenses . with",
    "kinematically well - characterized populations ",
    "e.g. , those ( presumably ) of the galactic halo and lmc  this procedure appears to be a reasonable one for estimating the mass function of the lensing population .",
    "the detailed statistical relation can be derived as follows .",
    "starting from the marginalization tautology @xmath28 one changes variables within the integrand , from @xmath14 and @xmath29 to @xmath30 and @xmath31 : @xmath32 as shown in appendix a , in any likely application the impact parameter @xmath11 will be uniformly distributed independently of any other parameters , so that its distribution @xmath33 may be factored away from that of the other parameters and assumed to be a constant that can be absorbed into normalization of the model .",

    "equation ( [ m4 ] ) makes clear that @xmath14 and @xmath6 are effectively statistically independent , so the lensing amplitude carries no significant mass information .",
    "we can thus treat @xmath14 as a nuisance parameter and integrate it from the model , leaving one in which the only observable information is that of timescale @xmath9 .",
    "the integral of @xmath39 actually diverges as @xmath40 , but that lower limit corresponds to unobservably faint microlenses : in any practical observing program there will be a minimum observable amplitude , however poorly defined , that serves to determine the value of the integral of equation ( [ m4 ] ) over @xmath14 , and to partly convert the left - hand side of that equation to one of observed microlenses . to complete that conversion ,",
    "we multiply the model by the probability @xmath41 that a microlens of timescale @xmath9 will actually be observed ; this may be estimated by the observer based on properties of the observing process , so the ( non - normalized ) model becomes one corrected for observational selection : @xmath42 the superscript @xmath43 on the observable @xmath44 denotes a distribution of observed lenses only , while the @xmath45 on the integrand refers to the distribution among the entire population of objects from which the observed lenses and sources are drawn .",
    "put nearly into the standard form of equation [ m1 ] , we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the likelihood of observing a microlens of timescale @xmath9 arising from a lensing object of mass @xmath6 ( which enters via @xmath7 ; cf .",

    "the model may be numerically inverted to determine the underlying population mass function from an observed timescale distribution .",

    "if the observed @xmath66 is actually derived from the presumed kinematic model , the method will almost always converge to a reasonable approximation to the underlying mass function .",
    "note , however , that the statistical model is a smooth , non - linear mapping from the space of mass functions into that of observed timescale functions , for which we do not expect that every timescale distribution will have a legitimate mass function pre - image , given the adopted kinematic model . if either the timescale function is inaccurate ( due , e.g. , to sampling variations ) or the adopted kinematic model is incorrect , the richardson - lucy method may fail to converge when applied to this statistical model .",
    "the lensing population responsible for microlenses observed against the backdrop of the lmc probably represents the kinematically most homogeneous set of objects to be analyzed for mass function with the statistical model of the previous section .",
    "the macho project ( alcock et al . 2000 ) has detected between 13 ( criteria a ) and 17 ( criteria b ) simple  ( point - source and point - mass ) lensing events over a 5.7-year period .",
    "the timescale @xmath67 distributions for these observations are shown in figure 3 , together with their estimated observing efficiency @xmath68 ( note that the timescale @xmath69 of alcock et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is @xmath70 ) .",
    "thetimescale frequency functions as shown are gaussian kernel estimators applied to alcock et al s ( 2000 ) individual events ( their table 7 ) , with a smoothing kernel standard deviation set as large as possible ( @xmath71 days ) consistent with the very low estimated probability of detecting events with timescales less than @xmath72 days .",
    "the multi - modality of these distributions is quite possibly an artifact of small sample statistics , but the narrow range of observed timescales probably is not ( the matter is discussed further in  4 ) .",
    "there appears to be no unambiguous kinematic model of the dark halo with which these data may be used in application of the statistical model . while there is some dynamical evidence for the dark halo mass distribution ,",
    "there are few observational clues to the required velocity field even in the luminous halo .",
    "the root of the difficulty is that the velocity of interest here  that on the plane of the sky  is unobservable beyond the solar vicinity and can not be reasonably inferred from equilibrium dynamical models based on the collisionless boltzmann equation ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . beyond the solar vicinity ,",
    "such velocities are largely transverse to the galactic center and thus reflect orbital angular momentum as much as they do orbital energy . but angular momentum is essentially a free parameter in static equilibrium models , so that a whole sequence of models of different orbital angular momentum content may be fit to observed spatial densities and radial velocity distributions ( heggie & hut 2003 ) , and there is thus no effective theoretical or observational constraint on halo transverse velocity distributions",
    ". some evolutionary models of the luminous halo ( e.g. , sommer - larson et al .",
    "1997 ) are consistent with reasonable levels of velocity anisotropy that , in conjunction with the observed radial velocity dispersion of distant halo stars , suggest a large ( @xmath73 km s@xmath52 ) transverse velocity dispersion throughout the halo .",
    "but it is not at all clear that such speculative dynamical models of the luminous halo can be confidently applied to the dark halo .",
    "one is thus reduced to examining the compatibility of presumed dark halo kinematic models with the observed microlens timescale distribution .",
    "the initial choice of kinematic model has here been made so that all parameters are statistically independent ( the alternative will be considered shortly ) and with the narrow range of observed timescales in mind , so that the ranges of distances and velocities in the kinematic model have been kept as small as is reasonably consistent with a spheroidal , pressure - supported halo .",
    "thus , the  nfw law \" of dark halo spatial mass density , @xmath74 ( navarro , frank & white 1997 ) , is chosen  as the basis of the macho distance distribution , where @xmath75 is the galactocentric distance and @xmath76 kpc is the core radius .",
    "the resulting solarcentric distance distribution is then ( from appendix c ) : @xmath77 ^{2}\\right\\ } ^{-1}\\ ; ,   \\label{dl}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 ^ { { 1/2}}$ ] with @xmath79 kpc presumed .",
    "lmc source star distances are taken to all be @xmath80 kpc ( the more realistic assumption of a depth to the lmc does not change the result ) .",
    "the transverse velocity @xmath12 of the lens relative to the source , as seen from our location , includes the motion of the sun relative to the lmc , and of the non - rotating halo rest frame relative to the sun .",
    "the first of these is computed from the observed lmc proper motions of @xmath81 micro - arcseconds per year ( jones , klemola & lin 1994 ) and an lmc  distance of @xmath80 kpc , the second from a presumed rotation rate of the sun relative to the halo of @xmath2 km s@xmath52 .",
    "the resulting mean velocity of the halo across the line - of - sight to the lmc is thus @xmath82 km s@xmath83 .",
    "relative to this mean frame we conservatively adopt a halo velocity dispersion on the plane of the sky of @xmath84 km s@xmath52 ( binney & merrifield 1998 , scheffler & elssser 1988 , sommer - larsen et al .",
    "1997 ) and realize this with low angular momentum orbits characterized by a dark halo internal gaussian random velocity distribution of mean @xmath57 . with these and the presumption of no significant lmc internal velocities ,",
    "we compute ( by the method of  3 of appendix b ) the distribution of @xmath12 shown in figure 4 .",
    "( left panel ) and relative transverse velocities @xmath12 ( right panel ) in the assumed dark halo kinematic model ( see text ) . ]      the integral kernel @xmath85 computed for these distributions ( and assuming the @xmath62 estimated by alcock et al .",
    "2000 and illustrated in figure 3 ) is similar in appearance to that of the example shown in figure 1 . in application to presumptive lens populations of a single mass ( i.e. , @xmath16 as a delta function centered on the chosen mass ) , this model gives rise to the sample timescale distributions shown in figure 5 .",
    "it is apparent that no non - pathological lens mass function can adequately reproduce the observed timescale distribution , given this kinematic model ( the richardson - lucy interactive inversion method of  2.3 , applied to this model and alcock et al.s [ 2000 ] criteria a observed timescale function , does not converge ) .",
    "the difficulty can be ascribed to the wide range of lens distances and velocities in the kinematic model , which lead to similarly wide ranges of observed timescales for given lens mass .",
    "the obvious alternative kinematic models do little , if anything , to rectify this discrepancy .",
    "isothermal models , both with and without mass segregation , lead to different kernels @xmath86 or @xmath87 ; binney & merrifield 1998 , alcock et al . 1996 , 1997 ) will typically exacerbate the problem , as will the inclusion of lmc internal velocity dispersion in the computation of @xmath12 .",
    "the timescale distribution widths may only be adequately decreased in a spheroidal halo by ( 1 ) postulating a halo velocity field with a very small transverse velocity dispersion , probably less than @xmath88 km s@xmath52 , while continuing to ignore the lmc internal motions ; and/or ( 2 ) greatly decreasing the spatial range encompassed by the lensing populations , as in a thin shell .",
    "neither of these seems dynamically plausible .",
    "additional caveats , based on the small sample size and poor numerical conditioning of the statistical model , are discussed in  4 . for the moment , the microlens timescale distribution as observed appears to be inconsistent with a standard , spheroidal , pressure - supported model of the dark halo .",
    "as one possible alternative to the dark halo microlensing model we consider a rotating , low - dispersion , thick disk as the site of microlensing objects . to be consistent with the roughly constant rotation velocity in the outer disk , we adopt a spatial mass density that varies with galactocentric distance @xmath89 in the disk , and height @xmath22 above the disk , of @xmath90 .  following the argument of appendix c , the distribution of solarcentric distances will be@xmath91 \\ ; ,   \\label{td1}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 ^{1/2}$ ] and we again choose @xmath79 kpc . to keep the timescale dispersions small we choose @xmath93 kpc in a co - rotating thick disk of @xmath94 km s@xmath52 velocity dispersion .",
    "both of these are at the low end of what would be expected , both observationally and dynamically ; but they seem possible .",
    "we further assume the statistical independence of all kinematic parameters , a constant source distance of @xmath80 kpc , and an internal velocity dispersion of @xmath94 km s @xmath52 for the lmc ( but no rotation ) .",
    "then the integral kernel @xmath95 corresponding to this kinematic model produces the single - mass timescale functions of figure 6 , from which it is apparent that a distribution of lens masses encompassing roughly @xmath96 to @xmath97 solar masses may suffice to explain the macho observed timescale distribution .        in this case",
    "the richardson - lucy inversion procedure of  2.3 converges to the results shown in figure 7 .    ] and",
    "[ kernel ] ) .",
    "the heavy curve is the observed timescale distribution . ]    for this postulated thick disk there is no evidence for lensing objects exceeding one solar mass , and some evidence that a significant fraction of the lenses have low- or sub - stellar masses .",
    "the statistical model of equations [ mfinal ] and [ kernel ] is the complete deterministic connection between the lens population mass function and the distribution of timescales among observed microlenses .",
    "it is fully corrected for observational selection based on timescale and maximum amplitude observability , providing these are mutually independent ( which will usually be the case ) .",
    "the correction for selection on the basis of amplitude arises from a basic model ( eq . [ [ m4 ] ] ) that includes the amplitude as an observable , from which it is removed by integration over , in effect , observable amplitudes only .",
    "the result ( easily proven by construction of a basic model for timescales only ) is the inclusion of an additional factor of @xmath7 in the integrand : the observability of a microlensing event , in terms only of amplitude , is proportional to the einstein radius of the lens , hence ( approximately ) to @xmath98 .",
    "appendix a provides a formal derivation of event impact parameter distributions : for all practical purposes these are uniform on a range exceeding that likely to be encountered in amplitude - limited observations .",
    "these results lead to a formal distribution of event amplitudes ( eq . [ [ lalpha ] ] ) , which is independent of kinematic model parameters and of lens mass ; so that microlens mass information must come only from event timescales .",
    "these are both familiar results , here rigorously derived .",
    "the statistical model is limited in applicability by its relatively poor numerical conditioning , reflective of the small contribution of lens mass to the event timescale .",
    "the formal concept of condition number is not strictly applicable to such non - linear models , but the sensitivity of the observed timescale distribution to the mass function can be crudely estimated as the change in mean timescale ( as computed from the model ) for a given change in scale of a mass delta function . for the example of  2.2 , this sensitivity is about @xmath99 days per @xmath100 solar masses over the range of @xmath101 solar masses .",
    "while this number depends upon the kinematic model adopted , it is probably typical of most applications to widely distributed kinematics and suggests a relatively poorly conditioned model from which mass function information will be difficult to extract .",
    "the poor numerical conditioning of the model is reflected in its smoothing effect in translating mass functions into timescale distributions .",
    "this is apparent from the thick disk model result of  3.4 , where nearly delta - function mass distributions serve to reproduce the smooth , bimodal observed timescale distribution .",
    "it is for this reason that no realistic mass function can reproduce the substantial timescale structure in alcock et al.s ( 2000 ) criteria b sample ( dashed curve in figure 5 ) : the isolated event near 150 days , if real , is a true outlier , perhaps arising from a separate lens population .    for microlensing toward the lmc ,",
    "the conditioning difficulty is exacerbated by uncertainties in the observed timescale distribution due to small sample statistics .",
    "re - sampling of the presumed timescale distribution ( criteria a of alcock et al .",
    "2000 ; heavy curve in figure 5 ) demonstrates that a wide range of timescale distributions is likely to arise from such a small sample .",
    "a significant fraction of 13-object distributions drawn from , e.g. , a gaussian of mean @xmath102 days and standard deviation @xmath103 days ( roughly those of criteria a events ) show bi - modality similar to that of the criteria a distribution , so that the observed bi - modality may well be a spurious consequence of small - number statistics .",
    "it thus seems unlikely that the current microlensing observations toward the lmc could meaningfully constrain the ( presumably ) underlying dark halo mass function .",
    "even such summary statistics as the mean mass are in some doubt : since @xmath104 for given event timescale , and the mean of @xmath105 depends as much upon the poorly known lmc proper motions as it does on the solar galactocentric velocity , the canonical value of @xmath106 solar mass ( e.g. , alcock et al . 2000 ) may well be incorrect by a substantial factor .",
    "but the narrow range of observed timescales appears to be real : re - sampling experiments from this and similar distributions suggest little likelihood that the true distribution is sufficiently broader than that observed as to be compatible with kinematic distributions as broadly distributed as those expected of a spheroidal , pressure - supported population of modest mean orbital angular momentum .",
    "it seems likely that the population producing the microlenses observed toward the lmc must come from something other than a standard  halo , either dark or luminous .",
    "the results of  3.4 suggest that a thick disk origin is one possibility ; no doubt there are others .",
    "we take as the most likely geometric model one in which , at the commencement of the survey , the lensing candidates are uniformly distributed on the plane of the sky in the vicinity of the source star being observed .",
    "the geometry of the encounter is described entirely by the original distance between lensing object and source star , @xmath89 , and the direction @xmath107 of motion relative to the radius vector from star to lens ; both measured in the lens plane .",
    "the impact parameter corresponding to @xmath108 will then be @xmath109 ; @xmath89 will be distributed as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the limiting radius of the search area in the lens plane ; and , by virtue of the uniform distribution of lens locations , we can safely presume @xmath107 to be uniformly distributed on @xmath112 . by a useful theorem of cumulative distributions ( e.g. ,  7.26 of kendall , stuart and ord 1987 ) , the pdf of @xmath11 is given by@xmath113 where @xmath114 is the set of all lens coordinates for which the impact parameter is less than @xmath11 .",

    "this formula has been verified by monte carlo simulations based on the above geometric model . in most applications",
    "the largest impact parameter corresponding to observable amplitudes will be smaller than @xmath111 by several orders of magnitude ( about @xmath117 for observable halo microlenses ) and @xmath118 may safely be taken to be a constant independent of all other parameters .",
    "the above result , with the assumption @xmath119 , leads to the amplitude likelihood of equation [ lalpha ] . from that relation the distribution of scaled impact parameter @xmath8",
    "is easily seen to be @xmath120 the distributions of observable microlens impact parameters , scaled or not , are thus expected to be uniform and independent of distributions of lens distances , velocities , or masses .",
    "the velocity @xmath12 is the relative velocity of lens and source star , projected onto the plane of the sky , as seen from our location .",
    "it can usually be computed as the magnitude of the vector sum of two or more projections of velocity components onto the plane of the sky . for many applications",
    ", the following results will suffice to compute the distribution of this quantity , from a kinematic model of the three - dimensional velocity distributions of lenses and source stars .",
    "an isotropic space velocity @xmath121 will have a magnitude projected onto the plane of the sky , @xmath122 , given by the simple projection relation encountered in , e.g. , analysis of binary star orbits ( chandresakhar and mnch 1950 ) : @xmath123      two statistically independent , mutually orthogonal , random velocity components @xmath124 on the plane of the sky ; have a combined magnitude @xmath125^{1/2 } $ ] at a position angle @xmath126 , whose joint distribution is given by the simple variable transformation : @xmath127 ( @xmath121 is the jacobian ) .",
