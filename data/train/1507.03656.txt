    "case ( ix )  the only considerable change ( apart from the stars with upper limits ) is for star @xmath121 ( sdss  j2209@xmath910028 ) .",

    "we stress that , even though there could be additional suitable candidates for the ump progenitors , such as the fast rotating massive stars from @xcite and the faint supernovae from @xcite , the models presented in this work are capable of describing the differences in the abundance patterns by adjusting the progenitor mass and explosion energy .",
    "comparison with similar studies from the literature shows that , even though higher progenitor masses ( @xmath143 ) also show good agreement for the most extreme cases , such as smss  j0313@xmath916708 , models have their best fits for @xmath131 , which is consistent with the mass range found in this work . besides having additional targets at @xmath6}}}<-4.0 $ ] for comparison , it is important to have accurate nitrogen and light element abundances for all ump stars in the literature",
