    "cu virginis ( = hd124224 ) is an a - type magnetic chemically peculiar star ( mcp ) with a rotational period of 0.52 days , one of the shortest for this class of stars .",
    "as observed in all mcp stars , the variability of the light curve is correlated with the spectroscopic variations @xcite and with the effective magnetic field @xcite .",
    "all those characteristics can be explained in the framework of the oblique rotator model , where the axis of the dipolar magnetic field is tilted with respect to the rotational one @xcite and abundance of elements is not homogeneously distributed over the stellar surface .",
    "the observed variabilities are thus consequence of the stellar rotation .",
    "mcp stars are in general slow rotators in comparison with normal b and a - type main sequence stars .",
    "this behaviour can be explained as the result of the action of a magnetic breaking .",
    "but , at the present , only two mcp stars have been found to increase their rotational period ; they are 56 ari and cu vir .",
    "while the former shows a continuous breaking down at the rate of few seconds per century @xcite , cu vir has been subject of an abrupt increase of the rotational period @xcite . from the analysis of photometric light curves collected over 40 years",
    ", it seems that a change of period of about two seconds occurred abruptly in 1984 .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this event is still under debate , and precise timing of the rotation is needed in order to detect any further slowing down of the star .",
    "radio emission has been observed in cu vir @xcite .",
    "the radio spectrum is quite flat and extends up to mm wavelengths @xcite with an high degree of circular polarization @xcite .",
    "the variabilities of total intensity and polarization are both correlated with the rotation of the star , suggesting we are in presence of gyrosyncrotron emission from an optically thick source .",
    "the anisotropic stellar wind inferred from spectral line variations in mcp star @xcite , associated with the magnetic field justifies the radio emission .",
    "@xcite developed a three - dimensional model to explain the radio emission from mcp stars .",
    "the dipolar magnetic field interacts with the stellar wind , that can freely escape from the polar regions outside the alfvn surface ( outer magnetosphere ) but remains trapped in the equatorial belt ( inner magnetosphere ) .",
    "ionized particles flowing out in the transition region between outer and inner magnetosphere , called middle magnetosphere , stretch the magnetic field lines just outside the alfvn radius and open the field generating current sheets , where particles are accelerated up to relativistic energies .",
    "they eventually propagate back toward the stellar magnetic poles following the field lines and radiating for gyrosyncrotron process . as the magnetic field intensity increases traveling to the star",
    ", they are reflected back outward by the magnetic mirroring effect and are definitively lost from the magnetosphere .",
    "this model , used to explain the observed fluxes and variability of mcp stars ( hd37479 and hd37017 ) has been successfully applied to cu vir by @xcite . on the basis of multiwavelengths radio observations , important physical parameters of the stellar magnetosphere , as the alfvn radius ( @xmath0 ) and the mass loss ( about @xmath1 ) have been inferred .",
    "a further observational evidence supporting the picture outlined above is the discovery of coherent , highly directive , 100% polarized radio emission at 1.4  ghz @xcite .",
    "the two peaks of radio emission have been observed at the rotational phases when the magnetic axis of the dipole is perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the two peaks have been observed in three observing runs spanning 10 days , indicating that the emission mechanism is persistent at least in timescales of weeks .",
    "this has been interpreted as electron cyclotron maser emission from a population of electrons accelerated in the current sheets at the alfvn point , that developed a loss cone anisotropy after the mirroring and masing in a direction almost perpendicular to the motion , so to the field lines , just above the magnetic pole .    in this paper",
    "we present radio observations of cu vir at 1.4 and 2.5  ghz carried out with the aim to confirm the maser emission and to study its spectrum .",
    "the directivity of the radiation is used to check the rotational period as the beam point toward the earth two times per rotation .",
    "the observations have been carried out at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in two days , the first on may 29th 1999 , the latter on august 29th 1999 .",
    "we used all the 6 telescopes for both the observing runs . on the first run the array was in configuration 6a , with a minimum and maximum antenna spacing of 628 and 5939  m ; on the latter run in configuration 6d , with antenna spacing in the range from 367 to 5878  m. the acquisition has been obtained with the 20-cm/13-cm feedhorns receivers , observing simultaneously at two frequencies , namely l band , centered at 1384 mhz , and s band , centered at 2496 mhz , and two linear polarizations . for both frequencies we used a bandwidth of 128 mhz , split in 16 channels , with a spectral separation of 8 mhz .",
    "all the four correlator cross products of linear polarizations ( xx , yy , xy , yx ) for each couple of telescopes have been obtained with an integration time of 30 seconds .",
    "the target source cu vir has been observed in cuts of 20 minutes , preceded and followed by 4 minutes observations of the compact quasar 1406 - 076 , used as phase calibrator .",
    "the amplitude scale has been determined by observations on the radio galaxy pks b1934 - 638 , with a flux density of 14.9 and 11.6 jy at l and s band respectively .",
    "data reduction and editing has been performed by using the miriad package .",
    "all the channels have been inspected and some removed because of interferences , reducing in some case the total bandwidth .",
    "the four linear polarizations cross products have been converted into the stokes parameters @xmath2 by using the standard calibration tasks .",
    "maps of cu vir have been obtained at 1.4 and 2.5  ghz in stokes @xmath3 for the two days of observations .",
    "the average flux densities are shown in table  [ flux ] .",
    "errors have been evaluated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rms of the map and @xmath6 is the error associated to the flux calibration , assumed 5% of the measured flux density .",
    ".stokes @xmath3 flux densities [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the phase delay @xmath7 of the markers of the rotation of cu vir indicates that the star is slowing down .",
    "new photometric data seem to indicate further slowdown @xcite . but how does it happen ? continuously or suddenly ?    in the case of a continuous breaking down , there should be a delay also in the 1998 observations with respect to the photometric observations reported by @xcite , that have been completed in 1997 .",
    "in fact , the accuracy of the delay determination from the radio observations allow to detect the slowing down in one year .",
    "but we have not found any difference between the 1998 data and the photometric measurements of 1997 , and we can rule out the continuous breaking down .    in the following we assume a sudden change of rotational period .",
    "the average of the phase shifts during the two observations in 1999 is @xmath8 and a delay @xmath9 .",
    "we do nt know exactly when the change of period occurred ; assuming that this occurred in 1998 , just after the previous observations , in @xmath10 year ( after @xmath11 rotations of the star ) @xmath12 increased at least of @xmath13 but if it occurred later , the change of period increases accordingly .",
    "the change of rotation rate is thus : @xmath14 quite close to the previous period jump .",
    "the period jumps are reported in fig  [ jumps ] as a function of the time .",
    "the average spindown of the star can be evaluated by noting one period jump of @xmath15  s @xcite occurs in @xmath16 years . since @xmath15  s",
    "; this leads to an average breaking given by @xmath17 we can compute the characteristic breaking rate @xmath18 corresponding to a characteristic breaking time @xmath19 .",
    "this behaviour seems to be confirmed by recent observations @xcite at a slightly different frequency .",
    "three possible explanations for the spin down mechanism acting in cu vir exist :    1 .",
    "there is a change of the moment of inertia due to a redistributions of the internal mass of the star @xcite ; 2 .",
    "the star loses angular momentum interacting with the external space via magnetic breaking ; 3 .",
    "violent emptying of the inner magnetosphere causes the loss of angular momentum , as hypothesized by @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the moment of inertia with @xmath22 radius of gyration ( @xmath23 by @xcite ) and @xmath24 mass of the star , hence is @xmath25 adopting @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite . in the following",
    "we compute the change of rotational rate in the three hypothesis .",
    "if the star does not lose angular momentum , the change of period is only due to the change of the moment of inertia @xmath28 this possibility has been investigated by @xcite , who concluded that the magnetic field of cu vir is too weak to alter the moment of inertia of the whole star considered as a rigid rotator",
    ". however it should be possible a redistribution of the mass of the outer envelope of the star , where the magnetic energy dominates over the gravitational one .      in the case that the star does not change its internal structure , @xmath3 is constant and @xmath29 now we consider the possibility that the spin down is due the wind flowing continuously from the magnetic polar caps .",
    "in this case however there should be no abrupt change of rotational period .",
    "the angular momentum losses is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the actual mass loss and the alfvn radius given by @xcite .",
    "we get @xmath33 that is 4 orders of magnitude lower that the value of equation ( [ dp_su_p ] ) .",
    "we can conclude that the steady loss of angular momentum due to the stellar wind can not explain the observed slowing down rotational period .",
    "we can instead assume that the material accumulated in the inner magnetosphere @xcite reaches a maximum density , than suddenly opens the field lines close to the alfvn radius in a single event .",
    "in this case @xmath34 following @xcite , the maximum density which can be kept by the magnetic field in a rotating magnetosphere is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the distance from the rotational axis and the magnetic field respectively .",
    "in the inner magnetosphere , the magnetic field is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the magnetic colatitude and @xmath40 the magnetic field strength at the pole .",
    "we can get @xmath41 in all the points inside the inner magnetosphere , i.e. inside the magnetic line field reaching the alfvn radius .",
    "the total mass that can be contained is given by @xmath42   dx\\ ] ] adopting @xmath43 @xcite , in the magnetic equator , the maximum density varies as @xmath44 , with a value at alfvn radius of about @xmath45 ( corresponding to a number density of @xmath46 ) we get @xmath47 g .",
    "however , as @xcite found that the density distribution in cool cp stars like cu  vir deviates from the alfvn inside the magnetic loop of height about @xmath48 @xmath49 , we get @xmath50 g . if during this kind of violent event all this mass is released and flows through the alfvn surface , the corresponding jump of angular momentum is given by @xmath51 where the lower value refers to the case of magnetosphere not fully filled . in this hypothesis @xmath52 with all the uncertainty of the case ( in @xmath53 , mass , magnetic field strength ... ) we can conclude that a violent release of material accumulated in the inner magnetosphere up to the critical alfvn density could account for the observed change of rotational period ( see eq .",
    "[ deltap ] ) .",
    "the observations of cu vir carried out with the atca at 1.4 and 2.5 ghz confirm the presence of the coherent emission already reported by @xcite after one year from the discovery , indicating that this is a steady phenomenon .",
    "the emitted radiation is visible only at rotational phases corresponding to the instant when the oblique axis of the magnetic dipole lies on the plane of the sky .",
    "this indicates the high directivity of this component of the radio emission .",
    "all those characteristics , and the fact that it is 100% right hand circularly polarized , are in agreement with the process of electron cyclotron maser from electrons accelerated in the current sheets out of the alfvn radius , propagating back to the stellar polar caps and reflected outward by the converging magnetic field . the lack of reflected electrons at small pitch angle ,",
    "that fall in the stellar atmosphere , is the cause of the loss cone anisotropy that , in turn , generates this auroral radiation above the magnetic pole of the star .",
    "the polarization properties , the fact that the radiation is only right hand polarized , means that this process in efficient only above the north magnetic pole . this is possible as the magnetic field is not purely dipolar . the possibility of plasma radiation is ruled out since the high magnetic field strength in the region where the radiation is generated .    since the magnetosphere rotates obliquely around the rotational axis , the cyclotron maser is visible only when it points toward the earth , like a lighthouse . in this mode",
    "it is a good marker of the rotation of the star .",
    "the analysis done shows that the peaks are delayed of about 15 minutes with respect to the observations carried out one year before , indicating a possible change of the rotational period of the star , of the order of 1 second , occurred in the period 19981999 .",
    "a similar change of period @xcite , occurred around 1985 , has been already reported .",
    "cu vir is the unique single main sequence star with frequent abrupt spindown .",
    "different spinning down mechanisms are discussed : the possibility of a change of the moment of inertia of the star , the continuous spindown due to the wind flowing from the alfvn surface and the violent emptying of the inner magnetosphere . in this latter hypothesis",
    "the material accumulated in the closed field lines of the equatorial magnetic belt reaches a maximum density and opens the field lines in a violent event , releasing an angular momentum which may account the observed breaking .",
    "cyclotron maser emission from stars provides important information on the magnetospheres , as it has been observed in flare stars , in dme and brown dwarfs . in the future ,",
    "when high sensitivity radio interferometers such as ska will allow to discover more and more radio lighthouse of the same kind of cu vir , a new possibility to study with high precision the angular momentum evolution of young main sequence and pre main sequence stars will be opened .",
