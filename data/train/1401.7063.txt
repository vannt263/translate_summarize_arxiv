    "over the past few years the dominant explanation for the large mass to light ratios inferred for galactic and meta - galactic systems , that these are embedded within massive dark matter halos , has begun to be challenged .",
    "direct detection of the dark matter particles , in spite of decades of extensive and dedicated searches , remains lacking .",
    "this has led some to interpret the velocity dispersion measurements of stars in the local dsph galaxies ( e.g. angus 2008 , hernandez et al .",
    "2010 ) , the extended and flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( e.g. mcgaugh , sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) , the large velocity dispersions of galaxies in clusters ( e.g. milgrom & sanders 2008 ) , stellar dynamics in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. napolitano et al .",
    "2012 ) , the gravitational lensing due to massive galaxies ( e.g. zhao & famaey 2010 , chiu et al .",
    "2011 , mendoza et al .",
    "2012 ) , and even the cosmologically inferred matter content for the universe through cmb and structure formation physics ( e.g. skordis et al .",
    "2006 , halle & zhao 2008 , milgrom 2012 ) , not as indirect evidence for the existence of a dominant dark matter component , but as direct evidence for the failure of the current newtonian and general relativistic theories of gravity , in the large scale or low acceleration regimes relevant for the above situations .",
    "numerous alternative theories of gravity have recently appeared ( e.g. teves of bekenstein 2004 , and variations ; bruneton & esposito - farese 2007 , sobouti 2007 , f(r ) theories e.g. capozziello & de laurentis 2011 , capozziello et al . 2007 , conformal gravity theories e.g. mannheim & kazanas 1989 ) , mostly grounded on geometrical extensions to general relativity , and leading to laws of gravity which in the large scale or low acceleration regime , mimic the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) fitting formulas .",
    "similarly , mendoza et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have explored mond not as a modification to newton s second law , but as a modified gravitational force law in the newtonian regime , finding a good agreement with observed dynamics across galactic scales without requiring dark matter .",
    "in fact , recently bernal et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have constructed an @xmath1 extension to general relativity which in the low velocity limit converges to the above approach .",
    "a generic feature of all of the modified gravity schemes mentioned above is the appearance of an acceleration scale , @xmath0 , above which classical gravity is recovered , and below which the dark matter mimicking regime appears .",
    "this last feature results in a general prediction ; all systems where @xmath2 should appear as devoid of dark matter , and all systems where @xmath3 should appear as dark matter dominated , when interpreted under classical gravity .",
    "it is interesting that no @xmath2 system has ever been detected where dark matter needs to be invoked , in accordance with the former condition . on the other hand",
    ", the latter condition furnishes testable predictions .",
    "first , notice that for test particles in orbit around a @xmath4 star , in circular orbits of radius @xmath5 , the acceleration is expected to drop below @xmath6 for @xmath77000 au@xmath8 .",
    "the above provides a test for the dark matter/ modified theories of gravity debate ; the relative velocities of components of binary stars with large physical separations should deviate from kepler s third law under the latter interpretation .",
    "more specifically , seen as an equivalent newtonian force law , beyond @xmath97000 au the gravitational force should gradually switch from the classical form of @xmath10 to @xmath11 , and hence the orbital velocity , @xmath12 , should no longer decrease with separation , but settle at a constant value , dependent only on the total mass of the system through @xmath13 .",
    "that is , under modified gravity theories , binary stars with physical separations beyond around 7000 au should exhibit `` flat rotation curves '' and a `` tully - fisher relation '' , as galactic systems in the same acceleration regime do .    in hernandez et al .",
    "( 2012a ) we proposed that wide binary orbits may be used to test newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime .",
    "there we applied this test to the binaries of two very recent catalogues containing relative velocities and separations of wide binaries .",
    "the two catalogues are entirely independent in their approaches .    at the somewhat larger scales of globular clusters , with sizes of tens of parsecs and masses of order @xmath14 , the central values of the stellar velocity dispersion , projected on the plane of the sky , for many galactic globular clusters ( gc ) have been well known for decades , and are known to accurately correspond to the expectations of self - consistent dynamical models under newtonian gravity , e.g. king models ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 , harris 1996 ) .",
    "recently , a number of studies ( e.g. scarpa et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b , 2010 & 2011 and lane et al .",
    "2009 , 2010a , 2010b & 2011 , henceforth the scarpa et al . and lane et al .",
    "groups respectively ) have performed measurements of the projected velocity dispersion along the line of sight for stars in a number of galactic gcs , but as a function of radius , and reaching in many cases out to radial distances larger than the half - light radii of the clusters by factors of a few .",
    "the surprising result of the above studies has been that radially , although velocity dispersion profiles first drop along newtonian expectations , after a certain radius , settle to a constant value , which varies from cluster to cluster . as already noted by scarpa et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , it is suggestive of a modified gravity scenario that the point where the velocity dispersion profiles flatten , approximately corresponds to the point where average stellar accelerations drop below @xmath0 .",
    "several recent studies have shown dynamical models for self - gravitating populations of stars under mond or other modified gravity variants ( e.g. moffat & toth 2008 , haghi et al .",
    "2009 , sollima & nipoti 2010 , haghi et al .",
    "2011 , hernandez & jimnez 2012 ) which accurately reproduce not only the observed velocity dispersion profiles , but also the observed surface brightness profiles .    from the point of view of assuming newtonian gravity to be exactly valid at all low velocity regimes",
    ", it has also been shown that both velocity dispersion and surface brightness profiles for galactic gcs can be self - consistently modelled . under this hypothesis",
    ", it is dynamical heating due to the overall milky way potential that is responsible for the flattening of the velocity dispersion profiles e.g. drukier et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , kpper et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , lane et al .",
    "the constant velocity dispersion observed at large radii merely shows the contribution of unbound stars in the process of evaporating into the milky way halo . in attempting to sort between these two contrasting scenarios , we took a fully empirical approach in hernandez et al .",
    "( 2012b ) .",
    "there , we critically examine the plausibility of both gravitational scenarios by looking through the data for other correlations which each suggest .    for the newtonian case",
    ", we examine the best available inferences for the tidal radius of each cluster at closest galacto - centric passage , and compare it to the observed point where the velocity dispersion flattens .",
    "we found the former to generally exceed the latter by factors of 4 on average , making the newtonian interpretation suspect . also , we take all the clusters which the lane et al .",
    "group have claimed show no indication of a modified gravity phenomenology , based on the fact that their velocity dispersion profiles can be modelled using plummer profiles , and show that the fits with the generic asymptotically flat profiles we use are actually slightly better , in all cases .",
    "we shall use the term mondian to refer to any modified theory of gravity which reproduces the basic phenomenology of mond in the low velocity limit for accelerations below @xmath0 , of flat equilibrium velocities and a tully - fisher relation , regardless of the details of the fundamental theory which might underlie this phenomenology .    together with our previous results of hernandez & jimenz ( 2012 ) showing that the asymptotic values of the velocity dispersion profiles are consistent with scaling with the fourth root of the total masses , a tully - fisher relation for gcs , our results support the interpretation of the observed phenomenology as evidence for a change in regime for gravity on crossing the @xmath0 threshold .    a recent study reaching the same conclusions , but at a significantly distinct scale , can be found in , lee & komatsu ( 2010 ) show that the infall velocity of the two components of the bullet cluster , as required to account for the hydrodynamical shock observed in the gas , is inconsistent with expectations of full cosmological simulations under standard @xmath15 assumptions .",
    "this has recently been confirmed at greater detail by thompson & nagamine ( 2012 ) , and can in fact be seen as a failure not only of the @xmath15 model , but of standard gravity , as the required collisional velocity is actually larger than the escape velocity of the combined system .",
    "we note also the recent reviews by kroupa et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , famaey & mcgaugh ( 2012 ) and kroupa ( 2012 ) and references therein , detailing a number of observations in tension with standard @xmath15 assumptions .",
    "the newtonian prediction for the relative velocities of the two components of binaries having circular orbits , when plotted against the binary physical separation , @xmath5 , is for a scaling of @xmath16 , essentially following kepler s third law , provided the range of masses involved were narrow . in a relative proper motion sample however , only two components of the relative velocity appear , as velocity along the line of sight to the binary leads to no proper motion .",
    "thus , orbital projection plays a part , with systems having orbital planes along the line of sight sometimes appearing as having no relative proper motions .",
    "a further effect comes from any degree of orbital ellipticity present ; it is hence clear that the trend for @xmath16 described above , will only provide an upper limit to the distribution of projected @xmath17 vs. @xmath5 expected in any real observed sample , even if only a narrow range of masses is included .",
    "one should expect a range of measured values of projected @xmath17 at a fixed observed projected @xmath5 , all extending below the newtonian limit , which for equal mass binaries in circular orbits gives @xmath18 .",
    "further , over time , the orbital parameters of binaries will evolve due to the effects of galactic tidal forces and dynamical encounters with other stars in the field , specially in the case of wide binaries .",
    "to first order , one would expect little evolution for binaries tighter than the tidal limit of 1.7pc , and the eventual dissolution of wider systems .",
    "a very detailed study of all these points has recently appeared , jiang & tremaine ( 2010 ) .",
    "these authors numerically follow populations of 50,000 @xmath4 binaries in the galactic environment , accounting for the evolution of the orbital parameters of each due to the cumulative effects of the galactic tidal field at the solar radius . also , the effects of close and long range encounters with other stars in the field are carefully included , to yield a present day distribution of separations and relative velocities for an extensive population of wide binaries , under newtonian gravity .",
    "it is found that when many wide binaries cross their jacobi radius , the two components remain fairly close by in both coordinate and velocity space .",
    "thus , in any real wide binary search a number of wide pairs with separations larger than their jacobi radii will appear .",
    "finally , jiang & tremaine ( 2010 ) obtain the rms one - dimensional relative velocity difference , @xmath19 , projected along a line of sight , for the entire populations of binaries dynamically evolved over 10 gyr to today , as plotted against the projected separation on the sky for each pair .",
    "the expected keplerian fall of @xmath20 for separations below 1.7 pc is obtained , followed by a slight rise in @xmath19 as wide systems cross the jacobi radius threshold .",
    "@xmath19 then settles at rms values of @xmath21 .",
    "this represents the best currently available estimate of how relative velocities should scale with projected separations for binary stars ( both bound and in the process of dissolving in the galactic tides ) under newtonian gravity .",
    "we see that all we need is a large sample of relative proper motion and binary separation measurements to test the newtonian prediction for the rms values of the 1 dimensional relative velocities of jiang & tremaine ( 2010 ) , and to contrast the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 predictions for the upper envelope of the @xmath17 vs. @xmath5 distributions .    .",

    "we keep only binaries with a probability of non - chance alignment greater than @xmath25 .",
    "the binary search criteria used by the authors requires that the proposed binary should have no near neighbours ; the projected separation between the two components is thus always many times smaller than the typical interstellar separation .",
    "we use the reported distances to the primaries , where errors are smallest , to calculate projected @xmath17 and projected @xmath5 from the measured @xmath26 and @xmath27 values reported .",
    "although the use of _ hipparcos _ measurements guarantees the best available quality in the data , we have also removed all binaries for which the final signal to noise ratio in the relative velocities was lower than @xmath28 .",
    "we are left with a sample of 280 binaries , having distances to the sun within @xmath29 in pc .",
    "the data show a perfectly flat upper envelope in a @xmath17 vs. projected @xmath5 , hernandez & jimnez ( 2012 ) .",
    "the average signal to noise ratio for the data is 1.7 , with an average error on @xmath17 of 0.83 @xmath30 , which considering a @xmath31 factor from the top of the distribution to the real underlying upper limit for the sample , results in 3 @xmath30 as our estimate of the actual physical upper limit in @xmath17 .    the sloan low mass wide pairs catalogue ( slowpokes ) of dhital et al .",

    "also , extreme care was taken to include only physical binaries , with a full galactic population model used to exclude chance alignment stars using galactic coordinates and galactic velocities , resulting in an estimate of fewer than 2% of false positives .",
    "this yields only isolated binaries with no neighbours within many times the internal binary separation .",

    "we construct @xmath19 by considering only one coordinate of the two available from the relative motion on the plane of the sky .",
    "thus , each binary can furnish two @xmath19 measurements , which statistically should not introduce any bias .",
    "indeed , using only @xmath35 or only @xmath36 or both for each binary , yields the same mean values for the points shown .",
    "the small solid error bars result from considering an enlarged sample where each binary contributes two @xmath37 measurements , while the larger dotted ones come from considering each binary only once , and do not change if we consider only @xmath35 or only @xmath36 .",

    "the solid curve is the newtonian prediction of the full galactic evolutionary model of jiang & tremaine ( 2010 ) for binaries , both bound and in the process of dissolving .",
    "note that the results of this simulation deviate from kepler s law for @xmath5 larger than the newtonian jacobi radius of @xmath38 , whereas the discrepancy with the observed samples also occurs at much smaller separations . even considering the large error bars , where each binary contributes only one @xmath19 value , we see eight points lying beyond 1@xmath39 , making the probability of consistency between this prediction and the observations of less than @xmath40=@xmath41 .",
    "we obtain a constant rms value for @xmath19 of 1 @xmath30 , in qualitative agreement with expectations from modified gravity schemes .",
    "the vertical line marks @xmath42 ; we see the data departing from the newtonian prediction outwards of this line , and not before .",
    "the two independent catalogues , each using different sets of selection criteria , each perhaps subject to its own independent systematics , are consistent with the same result , a constant horizontal upper envelope for the distribution of relative velocities on the plane of the sky at an intrinsic value of 3 @xmath431 @xmath30 , extending over 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath5 , with a constant rms @xmath19 value consistent with 1 @xmath430.5 @xmath30 .",
    "this supports the interpretation of the effect detected as the generic prediction of modified gravity theories .",
    "we begin by modelling the observed projected radial velocity dispersion profiles , @xmath44 , for the globular clusters in our sample , hernandez et al .",
    "( 2012b ) . as seen from the scarpa et al . and lane et al .",

    "these first two regions are in accordance with standard newtonian king profiles , but they are then followed by a third outermost region where the velocity dispersion profiles cease to fall along keplerian expectations , and settle to fixed values out to the last measured point . as some of us showed in hernandez & jimnez ( 2012 ) , an accurate empirical modelling for these velocity dispersion profiles can be achieved through the function :     model of eq.(1 ) , seen to be accurate descriptions of the data .",

    "we now take the observed data points @xmath51 along with the errors associated to each data point , to determine objectively through a maximum likelihood method the best fit values for each of the three parameters in equation ( 1 ) , for each of the 16 observed globular clusters .",
    "the confidence intervals for each of the three parameters are then obtained without imposing any marginalisation .",

    "hence , even taking the fullest non - axisymmetric galactic mass model under newtonian gravity , with precise orbits derived from 3d velocity measurements for the clusters studied , together with total mass determinations tuned to the individual stellar populations of them , yields tidal radii as shown in figure ( 5 ) .    as already noticed by scarpa et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the flattening in the observed velocity dispersion profiles seems to appear at the point where the @xmath0 threshold is crossed .",
    "here we use the much more careful and objective modeling of the observed velocity dispersion curves of the previous section to test this point .",
    "we see that most gcs in the sample fall within @xmath56 of the identity , hernandez et al .",
    "( 2012b ) , with about a third falling further away .",
    "a quantitative test of the correlation being explored is possible , since the careful modelling of the velocity dispersion profiles we performed naturally yields objective confidence intervals for the parameters of the fit .",
    "we end this section with figure ( 6 ) , which shows the relation between the measured asymptotic velocity dispersion , @xmath46 , and the total mass of the clusters in question .",
    "these masses represent the best current estimates of the stellar mass for each of the clusters in the sample , including corresponding confidence intervals . as with all the other correlations and data presented",
    ", there is no dynamical modelling or modified gravity assumptions going into figure ( 6 ) , merely observable quantities .",
    "we see , as already pointed out in hernandez & jimnez ( 2012 ) , the gcs observed nicely comply with a scaling of @xmath71 , the tully - fisher law of galactic systems `` embedded within massive dark haloes '' .",
    "the straight line shows the best fit @xmath71 scaling , and actually falls only a factor of 1.3 below the modified gravity prediction for systems lying fully within the low acceleration regime ( e.g. hernandez & jimnez 2012 ) , for the same value of @xmath72 used here , as calibrated through the rotation curves of galactic systems .",
    "this small offset is not surprising , since the gcs treated here are not fully within the @xmath61 condition , most have an inner newtonian region encompassing a substantial fraction of their masses . a preliminary version of this last figure appeared already in hernandez & jimnez ( 2012 ) ; we reproduce here an updated version using now the extended sample of clusters treated , and @xmath46 values and their confidence intervals as derived through the careful velocity dispersion fitting procedure introduced .",
    "to summarise , we have tested the newtonian explanation of galactic tides as responsible for the observed @xmath47 phenomenology , and found it to be in tension with the observations , given the tidal radii ( at perigalacticon ) which the gcs in our sample present , are generally larger than the points where @xmath47 flattens , on average , by factors of 4 , with values higher than 8 also appearing .",
    "an explanation under a mondian gravity scheme appears likely , given the clear correlations we found for the clusters in our sample , all in the expected sense .",
    "in going to galactic scales , the local dwarf spheroidal satellites ( dsph ) of the milky way offer an interesting test bed for modified theories of gravity , being characterised by the highest dark matter fractions , when modelled under standard gravity . in hernandez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) we showed that fully self consistent dynamical models can be constructed for these objects under a modified newtonian force law , and found an interesting correlation .",
    "assuming standard gravity , dsphs with the oldest stellar populations show the highest dark matter fractions , something which has to be regarded as a curious coincidence .",
    "however , under the assumption that the stars alone determine the gravitational potential of modified gravity schemes , it is natural to expect , indeed it is predicted , that the gravitational forces will be strongest , and deviate further from the newtonian predictions , for the oldest stellar populations , having higher intrinsic mass to light ratios .    more recently , kroupa ( 2012 ) has pointed out a serious inconsistency in the standard gravity interpretation of tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "these small systems are formed during the interaction and merger processes of large galaxies . within standard gravity ,",
    "they are seen as transient stellar structures displaying out of equilibrium dynamics and containing no dark matter .",
    "this last condition follows from the large velocity dispersion values of the dark matter in the haloes of the large colliding galaxies , more than an order of magnitude larger than what would be required to form a stable halo around the forming small tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , recent observations have confirmed that these tidal dwarf galaxies have the same dynamics as normal , stable dwarf galaxies showing relaxed , equilibrium dynamics `` dominated by dark matter halos '' . basically , tidal dwarf galaxies lie along the same tully - fisher relation as defined by normal galaxies , including more standard dwarfs . thus ,",
    "under a standard gravity plus dark matter interpretation , we must accept as a curious coincidence that tidal dwarf galaxies , transient swirls of tidally drawn material in interacting galaxies , have the same internal velocities as normal dwarf galaxies , equilibrium systems dominated by dark matter haloes . under a mondian modified view",
    "however , the observation above is a prediction ; once tides form low density ensembles of stars , these will behave just like any other such set of stars , a standard dwarf galaxy dominated by the modified gravity regime , as internal accelerations are below @xmath0 .    at the even largest mpc scales of the bullet cluster ,",
    "a serious inconsistency in the standard gravity interpretation has been pointed out by lee & komatsu ( 2010 ) .",
    "these authors show that the encounter velocities for the two components of the bullet cluster , as determined by the careful hydrodynamical modelling of mastropietro & burkert ( 2008 ) constrained to yield the observed bow shock in the glowing x - ray gas , are so high , that they are totally incompatible with the current standard cosmological scenario .",
    "this conclusion has recently been confirmed in much more detail by thompson & nagamine ( 2012 ) , who show clearly through full standard cosmological simulations , that the probability of finding such a system as the observed bullet cluster , at the observed redshift , is lower than @xmath73 , essentially a statement of the impossibility of producing such a system under the standard cosmological scenario .",
    "the origin of these inconsistency is clear , and stems from the relation between the sound speed for the gas inside a virialized halo , and the escape velocity of these same halo .",
    "this last velocity is the highest at which an object falling into the central more massive cluster can be expected to appear , and it is only a factor of 2 higher than the isothermal sound speed in the gas .",
    "thus , encounters with mach numbers higher than two are inconsistent with standard gravity . within an expanding cosmological scenario",
    ", one must first overcome the expansion , making the highest mach numbers possible , somewhat lower than two .",
    "the strong bow shock seen in the x - ray gas of the bullet cluster however , testifies to an encounter with a mach number higher than 2 , and hence inconsistent with standard gr and newtonian gravity . clearly , no amount of dark matter can alleviate the problem , as adding dark matter will increase the impact velocity , but increase also , in the same proportion , the sound speed in the gas before the collision , and hence leave the mach number of the shock unchanged .",
    "one can not simply say that both original clusters were orbiting within the higher gravitational potential of a much larger structure , as at that redshift of 0.5 , in general , no larger structures excised , indeed , none is seen in the vicinity of the cluster in question .",
    "we have reviewed recent dynamical observations for wide binaries in the solar neighbourhood which show clear departures from the newtonian predictions on crossing the @xmath0 threshold , with equilibrium velocities becoming constant , as expected under mondian modified gravity schemes calibrated to explain rotation curves of large galaxies without the need for any dark matter . under a standard gravity interpretation , adding dark matter is not an option , as the scales involved are smaller than any where dark matter is expected , and any such addition would have to be extremely fine tuned ; no dark matter for binaries having accelerations higher than @xmath0 , and an increasing mini halo necessary as the semi - major axis grows beyond 7000 au .",
    "we have shown that the velocity dispersion profiles of globular clusters in the milky way tend to constant velocity values at the outskirts , at values which happen to scale precisely along the same @xmath74 relation as the galactic tully - fisher relation .",
    "this is natural under any mondian gravity scheme , but is inconsistent with standard gravity , where tidal velocity disruptions show an inverse scaling with mass , and clear scalings with orbital parameters and internal concentrations , none of which appear in the globular clusters studied .    at the largest scales of the colliding galaxy clusters in the bullet cluster system , it has been shown that the standard cosmological scenario is incapable of producing the strong bow shock seen in the glowing x - ray gas .",
    "adding any choice amount of dark matter will not solve the problem , as the increase in the infall velocity will be accompanied by an increase in the pre - collision sound speed of the gas , cancelling any potential increase in the mach number of the collision , necessary to explain the observed shock .",
    "the recent body of observational evidence reviewed her forces a change from considering gr plus dark matter , or modified gravity , as equivalently plausible options ; in the low velocity , @xmath61 regime , gravity does not follow the standard descriptions of einstein and newton .",
