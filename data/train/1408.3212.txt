    "gravitational deflection of light ray is the most important consequence of einstein s general theory of relativity .",
    "scientists have worked to find out the light deflection angle due to a gravitating body using different approaches .",
    "one of the approaches is the null geodesics , where based on any of the forms of the line element , either by using the perturbation @xcite or by integrating the null geodesic equations @xcite , the deflection of light ray is calculated . in this paper",
    "we have considered the _ material medium approach _ , to find out the trajectory of the light ray in the gravitational field of a rotating body ( also known as kerr field ) . in this approach ,",
    "the effect of the gravitation on the ray of light is estimated by considering the propagation of the electromagnetic waves be reduced to the problem of wave propagation in material medium in flat space time .",
    "this concept can be defined as the equivalent material medium approach .",
    "this method is attractive because it suggests that the classical optics is as suitable as that of the riemannian geometry for the study of the electromagnetic phenomena in a gravitational field .",
    "material medium approach was first used by the author tamm @xcite and then by balaz @xcite , to calculate the effect of a rotating body on the polarization of light .",
    "the same concept had also been utilized by plebanski @xcite to study the light scattering by gravitational field .",
    "felice @xcite had also discussed the optical phenomena for the deflection of a electromagnetic wave by gravitational field .",
    "mashhoon @xcite had calculated the deflection and polarization due to the schwarzschild and kerr black holes .",
    "later kopeikin and mashhoon @xcite also followed the same approach , to correct for the light deflection angle of the shapiro time delay caused by the rotation of gravitating bodies .",
    "fishbach and freeman @xcite derived the effective refractive index of the material medium in schwarzschild field and calculated the second order contribution to the gravitational deflection , where the value of the refractive index of any medium indicates the strength of the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "in a recent series of articles , evans and his co - workers @xcite derived and used the effective refractive index to calculate the gravitational time delay and trajectories of light rays in schwarzschild geometry .",
    "the authors also showed that the opto - mechanical analogy of general relativity reproduces the equation of * gr * and matches with the classical equations .",
    "m. alsing @xcite has extended the newtonian formalism of evans , nandi and islam @xcite to the case of stationary metrics , typical of rotating space times .",
    "ishihara , takahashi and tmimatsu @xcite studied how the polarization vector of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave propagates in a curved space - time in the presence of kerr black hole .",
    "they have showed that , in the weak field limit the rotation angle of the plane of polarization is proportional to the line of sight component of the black hole s angular momentum .",
    "the above fact is very similar to the faraday effect , if the angular momentum is replaced by the magnetic field .",
    "this justified that , the rotation of the plane of polarization due to the angular momentum of the kerr black hole is just the _ gravitational faraday rotation_. sereno @xcite has also used the similar idea to derive the time delay function and deflection angle by drawing the trajectory of the light ray by fermat s principle and also discussed the _ gravitational faraday rotation _ in the weak field limit .",
    "very recently , sen @xcite also used the same approach to calculate the light deflection for a static non rotating mass in schwarzschild geometry , by expressing the line element in an isotropic form to determine the trajectory of the light ray . in this paper",
    "we shall follow a similar approach corresponding to kerr field .    on the other hand , in a more conventional manner , using null geodesic method many authors have worked to find out the deflection angle solutions in the kerr field .",
    "iyer and hansen @xcite calculated the deflection angle using the null geodesic in the equatorial plane .",
    "they also concluded that the deflection angle due to kerr field is greater than the schwarzschild value for pro - grade or direct orbit and smaller for retrograde orbit .",
    "but as in the schwarzschild case , when the deflection angle exceeds @xmath0 , it forms in multiple loops and relativistic images are produced .",
    "for the higher rotation case , the effect is much more pronounced .",
    "bray @xcite presented approximate solutions to the equation of motion for a ray of light in the kerr field and considered multi - imaging aspect of the gravitational lens effect .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite presented an analytical treatment of gravitational lensing by kerr black holes , restricting the observers in the equatorial plane .",
    "keeton and petters @xcite have developed a general formalism for lensing by spherically symmetric lenses and studied the gravitational lensing by compact objects considering the metric in taylor series expansion in @xmath1 .",
    "ye and lin @xcite , discussed the strong similarities between gravitational lensing and optical lensing using the graded refractive index approach .    in the present paper we used the line element under kerr field in boyer lindquist form @xcite to calculate the gravitational bending of a light ray . in section [ 2 ] , we have calculated the velocity and hence the refractive index of a light ray in the kerr field .",
    "the value of @xmath2 involved in the expression of refractive index , due to rotating mass is also evaluated . in section [ 3 ] , we have obtained the expression of deflection angle of a light ray in equatorial plane due to kerr gravitating mass .",
    "section [ 4 ] is devoted to make the numerical calculation of the refractive index and deflection angle due to sun and some other pulsars . in section",
    "[ 5 ] , we have concluded our work .",
    "the exact solution of einstein s field equation of general relativity for a stationary , axially symmetric gravitational field of an uncharged rotating body is given by the kerr metric .",
    "this celebrated solution was first given by r. p. kerr @xcite .",
    "in the boyer lindquist form , in the @xmath3 co - ordinate system , the line element of kerr metric is as follows :    @xmath4    where    @xmath5    and @xmath6    the constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the schwarzschild radius and the rotation parameter of the kerr gravitating body . as usual @xmath9 and @xmath8 is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angular momentum of the gravitating body , m is the total mass of the gravitating body and @xmath12 is the velocity of light .",
    "if we consider @xmath13 the kerr line element reduces to schwarzschild line element , which represents the non - rotating or static gravitating mass . like the schwarzschild line element",
    ", the kerr element is also asymptotically flat .",
    "the coefficients of line element are independent of @xmath14 showing that it is axially symmetric .    in equatorial plane @xmath15 , which implies @xmath16 .",
    "under far field approximation we can assume , @xmath17 .",
    "thus the linearized form of the kerr metric in terms of spherical polar co - ordinates @xmath18 can be obtained with the first power in @xmath19 as @xcite :    @xmath20c^2dt^2 -   \\frac{1}{(1-\\frac { r_g}{r})}dr^2 - r^2 ( d\\phi^2 + d\\theta^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in most practical purposes the linearized kerr metric satisfactorily describes the gravitational field around a rotating star or planet . to derive the expression for refractive index ,",
    "we follow a procedure similar to the one adopted by sen @xcite for a static field ( schwarzschild geometry ) . thus to express the above line element in an isotropic form we introduce a new radius co - ordinate ( @xmath21 ) with the following transformation equation @xcite as    @xmath22\\ ] ]    the above equation may be also written as :    @xmath23    as was done by sen @xcite from eqn .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) the value of @xmath24 can be calculated as    @xmath25    substituting the value of @xmath26 and @xmath27 from eqn .",

    "therefore the velocity of light in the present case ( characterized by schwarzschild radius @xmath7 and rotation parameter @xmath8 ) can be expressed as :    @xmath35    but this expression of velocity of light is in the unit of length @xmath21 per unit time .",
    "we therefore write    @xmath36 \\nonumber\\\\ = & & c(\\frac{4\\rho - r_g}{4\\rho+r_g})^2\\sqrt{1 + 8 \\frac{\\alpha}{c } \\frac{d\\phi}{dt } \\frac{4\\rho r_g}{(4\\rho - r_g)^2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    substituting the value of @xmath21 from eqn .",

    "( [ e11 ] ) is due to the rotation of the gravitating body .",
    "the second term consists of the rotation parameter @xmath8 and the frame - dragging parameter @xmath45 due to the rotating body . for a static body ,",
    "this term just vanishes .",
    "however , for a very slow rotating body rhs of eqn .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) can be expanded , as an infinite converging series , as the second term is @xmath46 1 .",
    "it may be noted here that sen@xcite s work is restricted to static geometry .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) can include , the case of a rotating body ( stationary geometry ) .",
    "therefore , the case discussed by sen@xcite , comes out as a special case when @xmath8 is set to be zero .      the value of @xmath47 can be calculated by following a procedure from landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "below we outline this procedure , which can be used to calculate the expression for @xmath47 .    in the gravitational field of a rotating spherical mass , the relativistic action function @xmath48 for a particle with the time @xmath49 and the angle @xmath14 as cyclic variables ,",

    "however , to make the problem mathematically simpler to solve , we later defined our geometry contained in the equatorial plane by choosing @xmath15 ( in section [ 2 ] ) . by applying such conditions to the original kerr solution expressed by eqn.([e1 ] ) , we get a simpler form of the kerr solution as eqn.([e3 ] ) . after that we applied the material medium approach to get the value of refractive index as expressed in eqn.([e11 ] ) .",
    "but in section [ 2.1 ] , to calculate the frame dragging parameter @xmath45 of kerr gravitating body , we have not restricted our work to the equatorial plane in the begining .",
    "so we obtained a general expression for frame - dragging as in eqn.([e20 ] ) .",
    "later , we calculate the frame - dragging by restricting our problem to the equatorial plane , as it has been already done in section [ 2 ] to make the calculation easy .    thus , by restricting the light ray in the equatorial plane @xmath70 , the angular momentum @xmath52 can be expressed as    @xmath71    where @xmath72= impact parameter , which implies    @xmath73    so , for equatorial plane , @xmath16 and the eqn.([e20 ] ) becomes    @xmath74    now under far field approximation ( corresponding to the line element as in eqn .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) ) , the above expression becomes    @xmath75    where we define @xmath76 ( as was done earlier ) , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "* ) and the second term refers to the contribution due to rotation ( under kerr field geometry ) .    from eqn.([e25 ] ) , we can write the refractive index @xmath80 at an arbitrary point on equatorial plane in the kerr field as :    @xmath81^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\nonumber\\\\ = & &    n_{0}(x )   [ 1 + 2 s_{x}]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\nonumber\\\\ = & & n_{0}(x).\\eta_{x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above , we introduced the parameters    @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] .    here",
    "we can also show for all @xmath85 , we get @xmath86 .",
    "this is possible , as when @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we must have @xmath89 and @xmath90 . also since @xmath91 , we must have @xmath92 .",
    "now as @xmath89 , we can approximate @xmath93 and then we can finally show that @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , one can also write the expression of refractive index in terms of the following converging series :    @xmath95    now at @xmath43 , @xmath96 so that the refractive index becomes @xmath97 , which is exactly the same result calculated by sen@xcite .",
    "as already discussed in the end of section [ 2 ] , @xmath80 gives the general expression for refractive index in kerr geometry as a converging infinite series . for a slow rotating body",
    "the series will converge much faster .",
    "however , for static body the term containing @xmath98 , @xmath99 etc . in the rhs of eqn.([e27",
    "] ) will become zero .",
    "this will make the refractive index equal to @xmath100 , which is the expression already obtained by sen@xcite .",
    "the eqn . ( [ e27 ] ) provides the general expression for refractive index on the equatorial plane in kerr field .",
    "thus , the trajectory of the light ray can be written as ( sen * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath101    as had been already discussed by sen@xcite , here in our present problem the light is approaching from asymptotic infinity ( @xmath102 or @xmath103 ) towards the rotating gravitational mass , which is placed at the origin and characterized by schwarzschild radius @xmath7 and rotation parameter @xmath8 .",
    "then the ray goes to @xmath104 , or @xmath105 after undergoing certain amount of deflection ( @xmath106 ) . here , the closest distance of approach , for the approaching ray is @xmath72 .",
    "( we note that , in actual case the impact parameter and closet distance of approach are only approximately equal . ) when the light ray passes through the closest distance of approach ( i.e.@xmath107 ) , the tangent to the trajectory becomes perpendicular to the vector @xmath108 ( which is @xmath109 ) .",
    "now we change the variable to @xmath110 so that @xmath111 .",

    "( [ e26 ] ) and substituting @xmath117 , like it was done by sen @xcite , we can re - write the above equation as :    @xmath118^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\nonumber\\\\ = & & d_{k } \\int^{\\infty}_{v } \\frac { dx}{x\\sqrt{n_{0}^{2}(x ) x^{2}-d_{0}^2}}[1 + j(x)]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath119 ( corresponding to schwarzschild deflection ) . and we have also denoted    @xmath120    at this stage we can show that @xmath121 . as @xmath122 is discontinuous at @xmath123",
    ", we can remove its discontinuity and evaluate its values by applying lhospital s rule , which are as follows :    @xmath124    and    @xmath125    further , by differentiating @xmath122 and subsequently applying lhospital s rule once again , it can be shown that @xmath122 has maxima at @xmath126 and @xmath127 and all other values of @xmath122 within the domain @xmath128 to @xmath129 are less than this maxima .",
    "these maxima values are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "we may note that , these values are much smaller than 1 and actually become still smaller compared to 1 , when either @xmath130 or the field is weaker or both .",
    "so we may safely assume that , @xmath131 for all @xmath39 , for all practical purposes .",
    "in table 1 , we find for _ sun _ the difference in @xmath122 values for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , occurs only at 16th place after the decimal . for other objects we report @xmath122 values up to 5th place after the decimal .",
    "therefore , from eqns.([e29 ] ) and ( [ e30 ] ) one can write :    @xmath134 - \\pi\\nonumber\\\\ = & 2[i_0+i_1+i_2+i_3 + ............ ]   - \\pi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , we have introduced additional notations :    .[tab : table3 ] values of @xmath135 and @xmath122 of different gravitating objects for @xmath136 and @xmath137 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ eq : whole ] @xmath138    @xmath139    @xmath140    and so on .",
