    "the prototypical example of such a tls is an impurity tunneling between a close pair of host sites .",
    "the reaction of the electrons to this motion naturally reproduces the @xmath0 noise .    in this paper",

    "the effect is , in a sense , the inverse of the @xmath0 noise , as it derives from the reaction of the tls to the mesoscopic fluctuations of the electron density . as a mesoscopic phenomenon ,",
    "it is sensitive to magnetic fields and a change in the magnetic field produces qualitatively similar behavior as a change in electron density . moreover we derive a  memory magneto - resistance \" , where the magnetoresistance depends on the history of the magnetic field .",

    "the first term is a classical sum of probabilities which leads to the diffusion equation and the drude formula . the second  interference term \" , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : paths1 ] , is neglected in the drude equation .",
    "the usual justification is that the interfence depends on the relative phase of two paths , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the length of the @xmath55th trajectory and @xmath60 is the fermi momentum . but this phase fluctuates wildly since @xmath61 .",
    "thus one may think , incorrectly , the interference correction is a sum of terms with random signs and may be neglected .",
    "the remaining terms are purely classical and so any correction to the conductance @xmath62 would take the form , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of paths and @xmath65 is a correction to the classical probability .",

    "since @xmath64 grows with the size of the system , this leads one to think that all corrections must decay with the size of the system .",
    "however , the neglect of the interference term above is careless , since there are pairs of paths whose phases are fixed by symmetry , such as a path and its time reverse .",
    "these will not have cancelling phases and therefore they contribute to @xmath52 .",

    "<S> we propose that memory effects in the conductivity of metallic systems can be produced by the same two levels systems that are responsible for the @xmath0 noise . </S>",
    "<S> memory effects are extremely long - lived responses of the conductivity to changes in external parameters such as density or magnetic field . using the quantum transport theory </S>",
