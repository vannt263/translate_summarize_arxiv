    "the classical statistical approximation ( csa ) is an approximate scheme to study in real time the dynamics of a system of fields , as an initial value problem .",
    "it has been used in cosmology @xcite , in high energy nuclear physics to study heavy ion collisions @xcite , in studies of the schwinger mechanism @xcite , and in cold atom physics @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the time evolution of the fields is classical ( i.e. deterministic ) , and one averages over fluctuations of their initial conditions .",
    "obviously , this scheme neglects all the quantum effects that would normally affect the time evolution of a system . in the path",
    "integral language , it corresponds to taking the saddle point of the integral .",
    "this can be justified if the typical field amplitude in the system under consideration is large , so that the commutator of a pair of fields is much smaller than the typical field squared .",
    "some quantum effects can nevertheless be included in the classical statistical approximation via the fluctuations of the initial fields .",
    "indeed , it can be shown on general grounds that the leading ( i.e. of order @xmath1 ) quantum effects come entirely from the initial condition for the density operator of the system , while the quantum corrections that alter its time evolution only start at the order @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , there is a unique statistical ensemble of initial classical fields such that the csa coincides with the exact @xmath3 result for all observables  @xcite .",
    "these initial fields have a flat spectrum in momentum space , that extends to arbitrarily large momenta .    because the csa implemented in this manner ) momentum spectrum @xcite .",
    "this type of initial distribution corresponds to a classical ensemble of quasiparticle excitations , instead of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this version of the csa is free of any ultraviolet divergences ( for a spectrum that falls like @xmath4 , one gets some ultraviolet divergences , but the resulting approximation is super - renormalizable @xcite ) , but it also does not contain anything quantum . it may coincide with the underlying theory at tree level , but not beyond . ]",
    "contains all the @xmath5 contributions of the underlying theory , it also contains all their singularities , and in particular the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "in addition , it contains some of the higher order contributions , but not all of them since the quantum corrections to the time evolution are missing in this approximation .",
    "it has been shown recently that this leads to a dependence on the ultraviolet cutoff that can not be disposed of by the usual renormalization of the parameters of the theory .",
    "this can be seen in computer simulations using the csa @xcite , by a perturbative analysis of the graphs that arise in the csa @xcite , and also from the study of cutoff effects in the classical approximation of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "at the moment , it is not known whether the csa can be modified in order to remove these unwanted terms . however , regardless of this interesting theoretical question , it is important to have a good understanding of the structure of the standard 1-loop ultraviolet divergences .",
    "indeed , since they are identical in the csa and in the exact theory , they can be removed by the usual renormalization procedure .",
    "but their form may be quite complicated in the lattice formulation of the csa , especially for a generic lattice that may have anisotropic lattice spacings .",
    "generically , this requires the calculation at one - loop of the expectation value of interest , with lattice regularization and propagators , in the presence of a non - abelian background field .",
    "unfortunately , lattice perturbation theory is quite complicated , even for this seemingly simple task ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the main issue is the treatment of the background field , and the fact that one recovers gauge invariant results by combining several pieces that are not individually gauge invariant ( see the appendix [ app : lpt ] for an example of such calculation in the present context ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we pursue a different approach in order to obtain these 1-loop quantities , based on the so - called worldline formalism . historically , this formalism emerged from ideas based on the limit of infinite tension in string theory function of yang - mills theory @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite , and it soon appeared that it provides a powerful way of organizing field theory calculations , especially when gauge symmetry is part of the game .",
    "a pure field theory understanding of this formalism was later proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by a method which is similar to schwinger s proper time representation . for reviews on this approach",
    ", the reader may consult refs .",
    "this formalism has been applied to the evaluation of effective actions @xcite , to the study of pair production by an external field @xcite or the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "numerical algorithms based on this formalism have also been proposed @xcite . since",
    "our goal is to apply this formalism to a lattice field theory , the closest work we are aware of is in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a new method for evaluating functional determinants in terms of worldlines was proposed .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use this formalism in order to obtain useful expressions for 1-loop expectations values in a lattice field theory coupled to a ( fixed ) gauge background . as we shall see",
    ", the worldline formalism is well suited for this application because it enables one to have only gauge invariant objects at all stages of the calculation .",
    "then , we use these expressions in order to study the limit of small lattice spacing . in this limit , we obtain an expansion in terms of the background field strength , with coefficients that are given by sums over closed loops on the lattice , weighted by powers of the area enclosed by the loop .",
    "thus , the worldline formalism relates the coefficient of the short distance expansion to combinatorial properties of closed loops on a cubic lattice .    in the simple case where the lattice spacings are the same in all the directions , the combinatorial formulas we need were already known and can be found in ref .",
    "the generalization to anisotropic lattice spacings requires some combinatorial formulas that we could not find in the literature .",

    "@xcite .      in order to keep things rather simple and",
    "focus on the main aspects of the worldline formalism , we consider a complex scalar field coupled to an external non - abelian gauge field .",
    "this background field is given once for all , and does not fluctuate .",
    "we neglect the self - interactions of the scalar field .",
    "the lagrangian reads  : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the covariant derivative in the presence of the background field .",
    "we also assume that the system is initialized at @xmath10 into the perturbative vacuum .",
    "we consider the expectation values of local gauge invariant operators made of the field @xmath11 , e.g. @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . with the lagrangian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l ] ) and the vacuum state as initial condition , these expectation values are given by a 1-loop graph in a background field .",
    "these loops contain a pure vacuum contribution which is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "in addition , for operators that have a sufficiently high dimension , there may be subleading ultraviolet divergences , whose structure is however strongly constrained by gauge invariance .",
    "our goal in this paper is to investigate the structure of these divergences , with a lattice regularization .",
    "we work with an euclidean metric , in @xmath0 space - time dimensions , on a discrete cubic lattice . for definiteness ,",
    "the spatial directions are chosen to be @xmath15 and the direction @xmath0 can be considered as the time direction ( although this distinction is hardly relevant with an euclidean metric ) .",
    "our goal is to study the general case of arbitrary lattice spacings @xmath16 in each direction , but in the sections [ sec : phi2 ] and [ sec : bilocal ] we expose the formalism with an isotropic lattice for simplicity .",
    "the coordinates are labeled @xmath17 to @xmath18 , and we denote by @xmath19 the vectors corresponding to one lattice spacing in each of the directions . therefore , any point on the lattice can be represented as @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 are integers .      in @xmath0 dimensions and for completely arbitrary lattice spacings in each direction ,",

    "we denote @xmath28 these formulas are the archetype of the results obtained in this paper .",
    "we also derive similar formulas for bilocal operators of the form @xmath29 , where the point @xmath30 is separated from the origin by 1 or 2 lattice spacings . in these operators , @xmath31 is a wilson line along a path @xmath32 connecting @xmath30 to 0 , which is needed in order to have a gauge invariant operator .",
    "we shall see that the leading term of the expansion in powers of the lattice spacings does not depend on the choice of this path , while the second term in general depends on this choice .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we use the lattice worldline formalism in order to demonstrate these formulas for the coefficients of the expansion .",
    "we first obtain intermediate representations of these coefficients in terms of sums over all the closed random walks on the lattice , which relate their values to some combinatorial properties of random walks .",
    "these formulas can then be transformed into the integral representations listed above , by using the 2-dimensional combinatorial formulas of the appendix [ app : area - aniso ] .      in the section [ sec : phi2 ]",
    ", we derive in detail the worldline formulation of the expectation value @xmath7 on a lattice with isotropic spacings , and its short distance expansion .",
    "a subsection is devoted to the discussion of infrared divergences and their manifestation in the worldline formalism .",
    "we also introduce in this section the borel transformation that turns the combinatorial sums into integrals . in the section [ sec : bilocal ]",
    ", we extend this study to bilocal operators , i.e. operators that contain a @xmath33 and a @xmath11 evaluated at separate lattice spacings .",
    "this extension is of great practical importance , because these operators appear in the discretization of covariant derivatives .",
    "the section [ sec : aniso ] generalizes all the previous results to a more general lattice setup , where each direction of space - time has its own lattice spacing . as an illustration",
    ", we study the limit where one of the lattice spacings is much smaller than the others , and we apply this to a discussion of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "a number of more technical aspects are discussed in several appendices . in the appendix [ app : pn ] , we show how this formalism is modified on a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( in the main part of the paper , we take the limit of zero lattice spacing at fixed physical volume , so that the size of the lattice becomes infinite and the boundary conditions are irrelevant ) . in the appendix [ app : nl - d0 ] , we derive the leading coefficient of the expansion for bilocal operators with an arbitrary separation between the two fields .",
    "the appendix [ app : area - aniso ] discusses all the combinatorial formulas that are necessary in the case of anisotropic lattices , and in [ app : mathieu ] we recall the connection between the statistics of the areas of closed loops on a two - dimensional lattice and the spectral properties of the so - called almost - mathieu operator . in the appendix [ app : lpt ]",
    ", we obtain the short distance expansion of @xmath7 from lattice perturbation theory , mainly to illustrate the technical complexity of this approach . in the appendix [ app : cont - time ]",
    ", we study from the outset a hybrid description in which one of the directions ( e.g. time ) is treated as a continuous variable , while the others remain discretized and we show that this is equivalent to starting from a fully discrete description and taking one lattice spacing to zero .",
    "in order to establish the formalism , consider first the expectation value of the operator @xmath7 ( the color indices are summed to ensure gauge invariance ) at one loop . to lighten the notations",
    ", we evaluate the expectation value at the point @xmath34 , but all our considerations are completely general . since this expectation value is given by a 1-loop graph , we can first write @xmath35 the standard heat kernel approach would be to write @xmath36 however , in our case it is more convenient to use a discrete version of this formula is a discrete version of the integration variable @xmath37 . ] , @xmath38 which is also exact .",
    "we have multiplied @xmath39 by the lattice spacing squared in order to get a dimensionless combination .",
    "the purpose of the factor @xmath40 ( where @xmath0 is the number of space - time dimensions ) will become clearer later on .",
    "consider now a sequence of functions @xmath41 defined on the lattice , and satisfying the following iteration rule : @xmath42 if we define @xmath43 , then we have @xmath44 if we interpret @xmath45 as a probability distribution localized at the point @xmath34 , then @xmath46 is the probability distribution after @xmath47 iterations of the process described in eq .",

    "this equation describes a random walk where at each step one moves to one of the adjacent sites of the lattice with probability @xmath51 .",
    "we see now the reason for the peculiar normalization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp - phi2 ] )  : by doing this , we can eliminate the term proportional to @xmath52 in the right hand side , i.e. the possibility for the random walk process to stall during the step is also the length of the path . ] .",
    "@xmath53 is the probability that such a random walk returns at the point @xmath54 after @xmath47 steps .",
    "geometrically , this means that the random walk is a closed loop of length @xmath47 .",
    "since at each step , there are two possibilities to move in each direction , the total number of random walks of length @xmath47 is @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath41 is thus the number of _ closed _ random walks of length @xmath47 , divided by the total number @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , we can write @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the set of all closed random walks of base point @xmath54 ( i.e. starting and ending at @xmath54 ) and length @xmath58 on the lattice ( the length of such a closed path must be an even number ) . a few of the closed paths involved in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp - phi2 - 1 ] ) are illustrated in the figure [ fig : worldlines ] .    in the vacuum",
    ", the double sum is independent of the lattice spacing .",
    "it is just a pure number that sets the normalization of the result .",
    "the trace in the adjoint representation comes from the summation over the color indices , and brings a factor @xmath59 .      on the lattice ,",
    "the background field is represented in terms of compact link variables @xmath60 in order to preserve an exact gauge invariance despite the discretization . in terms of these link variables ,",
    "the covariant derivative squared becomes , @xmath61 therefore , when the links are not unity , the random walk is biased by the background field .",
    "the end result is that eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp - phi2 - 1 ] ) is modified into @xmath62 in words , the @xmath63 identity matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp - phi2 - 1 ] ) is replaced by a wilson loop @xmath64 obtained by multiplying all the link variables along the closed contour @xmath65 .",
    "this formula is manifestly gauge invariant , since wilson loops are gauge invariant .",
    "note also that this formula is exact at 1-loop on the lattice .",
    "in the previous subsections , we have introduced @xmath57 , the set of all the paths of length @xmath58 drawn on the lattice , with endpoints @xmath54 and @xmath54 ( i.e. closed paths ) .",
    "more generally , we will denote @xmath66 the set of paths of length @xmath47 from @xmath54 to a point @xmath30 ( all these paths have the same parity , which is also the parity of the sum of the coordinates of the point @xmath30 ) . to avoid encumbering the notation",
    ", we do not specify the dimension of the lattice in which these paths should be considered , since the context of the formula in which the notation appears is sufficient to make this obvious .",
    "when we need an explicit representation for a path , we denote it by the sequence of the hops it contains , such as @xmath67 ( read from left to right . )",
    "the notation @xmath68 denotes a hop in the @xmath69 direction .",

    "obviously , @xmath74 .    in two dimensions",
    ", we will also introduce later in the paper the subset @xmath75 , made of all the paths connecting @xmath54 to @xmath30 and making exactly @xmath76 hops in the @xmath77 direction and @xmath78 hops in the @xmath79 direction .",
    "the numbers @xmath80 of hops in the opposite directions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , do not need to be specified explicitly since it can be inferred from @xmath83 and the coordinates of the point @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 obviously , @xmath66 and @xmath75 are related by @xmath86    in order to develop some intuition with formulas such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp - phi2 - 2 ] ) , let us recall here some elementary properties of closed random walks .",
    "let us consider a closed random walk made of @xmath58 hops , all illustrated in the figure [ fig : rw ] in two dimensions .",
    "for such a random walk , one has the following properties :    * the length of the path is obviously @xmath87 , * the typical size of the domain explored by the random walk grows only like @xmath88 , * the area enclosed by the random walk ( or the area of its projection on a plane in @xmath89 dimensions ) grows as @xmath90 .    the property * ii * plays a role in the infrared behavior of the quantity under consideration .",
    "indeed , as we shall see later , infrared singularities arise when the contribution of `` large '' random walks does not decrease fast enough .",
    "similarly , * iii * plays a role in the second term in the expansion in powers of the lattice spacing .",
    "if we let the lattice spacing @xmath92 go to zero , while the background is held fixed in physical units , the wilson loop @xmath64 goes to the identity because the closed loop @xmath65 shrinks to a tiny loop of base point @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , it can be approximated by the exponential of the magnetic flux across a surface @xmath93 whose boundary is @xmath65 ( this surface is a tiling of elementary lattice squares ) , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the algebraic area , measured as a number of plaquettes since we have already pulled out a factor @xmath96 , of the domain enclosed by the projection of the contour @xmath65 on the @xmath97 plane .",
    "the orientation of @xmath65 dictates the orientation of the projection , which in turn controls the sign of @xmath95 .",
    "note that in this limit , the field strength can be considered uniform across the entire lattice , and therefore @xmath98 is evaluated at the point @xmath34 .",
    "since the loop size tends to zero when @xmath91 , we can do a taylor expansion of the exponential . in order to get a non - trivial answer after taking the trace , we must go to second order : @xmath99 ( a factor @xmath100 comes from @xmath101 . ) by plugging this in the formula ( [ eq : exp - phi2 - 2 ] ) , we obtain the following expansion @xmath102 \\label{eq : cont - exp}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath104 are purely geometrical quantities defined by sums over all the closed loops on the lattice @xmath105 ( note that in these formulas , we have replaced @xmath106 since only random paths of even length can be closed . )",
    "the equation ( [ eq : cont - exp ] ) provides an explicitly gauge invariant expansion in powers of the lattice spacing .",
    "the coefficients ( that remain to be calculated ) are geometrical quantities that depend on the dimension and the lattice under consideration , but not on the background field .    in the second of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coeffs ] ) , @xmath95 is the area of the surface enclosed by @xmath65 projected on the @xmath107 plane .",
    "several remarks are in order about this quantity :    * these areas are `` algebraic '' , in the sense that they may have a sign that takes into account the orientation of the boundary , and a multiplicity that depends on the winding number .",
    "* there are many surfaces with the same boundary @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath95 does not depend on this choice but only on the boundary .",
    "* they do not depend on the base point @xmath34 . specifying a base point is only necessary in order to avoid counting multiple times loops that have the same shape up to a translation .",
    "it is possible to provide an integral expression for the coefficient @xmath103 , starting from the combinatorial formula that explicitly counts the number of closed random walks in terms of the number of hops in the @xmath0 directions ( respectively @xmath108 ) , @xmath109 the factor @xmath110 prevents the complete separation of the sums over the @xmath111 .",
