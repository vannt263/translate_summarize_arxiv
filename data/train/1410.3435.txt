    "<S> when the kinetic energy of a collection of interacting two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrons is quenched at very high magnetic fields so that the coulomb repulsion dominates , the electrons are expected to condense into an ordered array , forming a quantum wigner crystal ( wc ) . </S>",
    "<S> although this exotic state has long been suspected in high - mobility 2d electron systems at very low landau level fillings ( @xmath0 ) , its direct observation has been elusive . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a new technique and experimental results directly probing the magnetic - field - induced wc . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the magneto - resistance of a bilayer electron system where one layer has a very low density and is in the wc regime ( @xmath0 ) , while the other (  probe  ) layer is near @xmath1 and hosts a sea of composite fermions ( cfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data exhibit commensurability oscillations in the magneto - resistance of the cf layer , induced by the periodic potential of wc electrons in the other layer , and provide a unique , direct glimpse at the symmetry of the wc , its lattice constant , and melting . </S>",
    "<S> they also demonstrate a striking example of how one can probe an exotic many - body state of 2d electrons using equally exotic quasi - particles of another many - body state .    </S>",
    "<S> interacting 2d electrons subjected to high perpendicular magnetic fields ( @xmath2 ) and cooled to low temperatures exhibit a plethora of exotic quasi - particles and states @xcite . at @xmath1 landau level filling factor , for example , </S>",
    "<S> the interacting electrons capture two flux - quanta each and create new quasi - particles , the so - called cfs @xcite , which behave as essentially non - interacting particles . </S>",
    "<S> the cfs offer an elegant explanation for the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe)@xcite . furthermore , because of the flux attachment , the effective magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) felt by the cfs vanishes at @xmath1 so that cfs occupy a fermi sea and exhibit fermi - liquid - like properties , similar to their zero - field electron counterparts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the presence of an imposed periodic potential , cfs resistance oscillates as a function of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the value of the external field at @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations are a signature of the commensurability of cfs quasi - classical cyclotron orbit diameter with an integer multiple of the period of the imposed potential , and their positions in @xmath3 reflect the symmetry and period of the potential .    </S>",
    "<S> another example of a collective state is the wc @xcite , an ordered array of electrons , believed to form at very small fillings ( @xmath6 ) when the coulomb repulsion between electrons dominates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wc , being pinned by the ubiquitous residual disorder , manifests as an insulating phase in dc transport @xcite , and exhibits resonances in its ac ( microwave ) transport which strongly suggest collective motions of the electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , however , there have been no direct measurements of the wc order or its lattice constant .    </S>",
    "<S> here we present high magnetic field data in a bilayer electron system with unequal layer densities . </S>",
    "<S> one layer has a very low density and is in the wc regime , while the adjacent layer is near @xmath1 and contains cfs ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . the cfs feel the periodic electric potential of the wc in the other layer and exhibit magneto - resistance maxima whenever their cyclotron orbit encircles certain integer number of the wc lattice points . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the maxima are consistent with a triangular wc and yield a direct measure of its lattice constant , while the disappearance of the resistance maxima as the temperature is raised signals the melting of the wc .    </S>",
    "<S> our samples were grown via molecular beam epitaxy and consist of two , 30-nm - wide , gaas quantum wells ( qws ) separated by a 10-nm - thick , undoped al@xmath7ga@xmath8as barrier layer . </S>",
    "<S> the qws are modulation - doped with si @xmath9-layers asymmetrically : the bottom and top spacer layer thicknesses are 300 nm and 80 nm respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry leads to very different as - grown 2d electron densities in the qws ; the top - layer has a density of @xmath10 1.5 @xmath11 @xmath12 , much higher than the bottom - layer density @xmath13 @xmath12 . based on the growth parameters and our data for other , single - layer samples </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the top and bottom layers to have low - temperature mobilities of @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16/vs , respectively . here </S>",
    "<S> we report data for a hall bar sample ( 200 @xmath17 m wide and 800 @xmath17 m long ) with insn ohmic contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was thinned down to about 120 @xmath17 m and then fitted with an in back - gate which covers its entire back surface . applying a negative voltage bias ( @xmath18 ) to the back - gate </S>",
    "<S> reduces the bottom - layer density . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were carried out in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of @xmath19 mk , and using low - frequency ( @xmath20 40 hz ) lock - in technique .        the longitudinal resistance ( @xmath21 ) vs @xmath2 traces presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 capture the highlight of our findings . </S>",
    "<S> data are shown only in the high-@xmath2 region of interest . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , we present traces for the bilayer sample at different @xmath18 . in the top trace , the bottom - layer is completely depleted so that the trace represents @xmath21 for the top - layer . </S>",
    "<S> this trace exhibits the usual characteristics seen in high - quality 2d electron systems ( 2dess ) : @xmath21 has minima at numerous odd - denominator fillings such as 3/5 , 4/7 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , indicating fqhe states , and is essentially featureless close to @xmath22 where it shows a broad , smooth minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the features in the lowest trace , are also characteristic of a simple , single - layer 2des . </S>",
    "<S> they , too , essentially reflect the properties of the top - layer , including its density and filling factors as a function of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom - layer , although present , is at a very small filling factor ( @xmath23 ) , has very high resistance , and appears not to contribute to @xmath21 at high fields near @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> ( based on measurements on single - layer samples , we esitmate the bottom - layer resistance to be several @xmath24 k@xmath25 at high _ b _ , about 100 times larger than the top - layer resistance . ) the middle trace in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) which is taken just before the bottom - layer is depleted , however , is unusual as near @xmath22 there are small oscillatory features superimposed on the smooth background . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , these features disappear when we warm up the sample . </S>",
    "<S> as we discuss below , these oscillations near @xmath22 reflect the commensurability of the cyclotron orbits of the cfs in the top - layer with the periodic potential induced by a wc formed in the bottom - layer ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) .    to test our hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> , we carefully analyze the positions of the anomalous @xmath21 maxima observed near @xmath22 in the middle trace of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) ; this trace is shown enlarged near @xmath22 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ( lower trace ) . a quantitative prediction of the expected positions of the cf commensurability features induced by the wc potential requires accurate knowledge of both cf and wc layer densities , i.e. , both top- and bottom - layer densities ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) at high magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , we can experimentally determine these densities quite precisely . </S>",
    "<S> our determination of @xmath28 is based on the magnetic field positions of the well - defined fqhe minima observed near @xmath22 . for @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , we subtract @xmath26 from the total density of the bilayer system ( @xmath29 ) , which we can also determine experimentally as described later in the manuscript .    using @xmath26 for the density of cfs ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath27 for the density of wc electrons ( @xmath31 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can predict the positions of commensurability features expected when the cf cyclotron orbit circles around @xmath32 wc lattice points ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) . assuming that each such orbit has equal distance to the nearest lattice points inside and outside the orbit ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ) , the diameters for the @xmath32 orbits have values of @xmath33 in units of the period @xmath34 of the triangular lattice . in the case of _ electrons _ near zero magnetic field moving in a triangular anti - dot lattice , strong magneto - resistance maxima consistent with such cyclotron diameter values have indeed been reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed nature and strength of the potential imposed by the wc on the cfs is of course unclear . </S>",
    "<S> however , experimental data for both electrons @xcite and cfs @xcite indicate that , even in the case of a _ weak _ 2d periodic potential , the @xmath35 cf commensurability resistance peak is observed when the cyclotron orbit diameter equals @xmath34 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we use small triangles to mark the positions of the _ expected _ commensurability resistance maxima for the @xmath32 orbits . </S>",
    "<S> these positions are based on the relation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the cf cyclotron radius and @xmath38 is the cf fermi wavevector . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 , namely we assume that @xmath30 is equal to the minority carriers density in the lowest landau level of the top layer ; see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a slight ( @xmath43 5% ) asymmetry in the expected positions of the two cf resistance maxima for @xmath40 and @xmath42 .    in fig </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , despite some clear discrepancies , there is overall a good agreement between the positions of the observed and expected resistance maxima . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the positions of the triangles are based on our _ measured _ top- and bottom - layer densities and do not rely on any fitting parameters . </S>",
    "<S> note also the disappearance of the oscillatory features above @xmath44 mk , which we associate with the melting of the wc . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the data in fig . 2 provide evidence that the cfs in the top - layer are indeed dancing to the tune of a wc formed at low temperatures in the bottom - layer .    </S>",
    "<S> we now describe details of our determination of top- and bottom - layer densities . besides providing @xmath26 and @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , the data also reveal subtle interlayer charge transfers that occur near zero and at intermediate _ </S>",
    "<S> b_. in our experiments , for each value of @xmath18 , we first measure the shubnikov - de haas oscillations at very low fields ( @xmath45 t ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of these oscillations typically exhibits two peaks whose frequencies directly yield the _ low - field _ densities of the bottom and top layers ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of @xmath46 and @xmath47 gives @xmath29 , which we assume is independent of the magnetic field . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we show the measured @xmath29 ( triangles ) and @xmath47 ( squares ) vs @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , @xmath29 changes linearly with @xmath18 ( with a slope that is consistent with the capacitance of our sample ) , and @xmath47 equals @xmath29 for @xmath48 v when the bottom - layer is completely depleted . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xmath18 is decreased from zero , @xmath47 _ increases _ initially before decreasing at smaller @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of the negative compressibility of an interacting 2des , and can be explained quantitatively using self - consistent ( poisson - schroedinger equations ) calculations that include exchange and correlation energies via local - density - approximation @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we show the results of such calculations for the parameters of our bilayer electron sample , indicating good agreement between the measured and calculated @xmath47 ( black squares and curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , respectively ) .    </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , however , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we find that the top - layer density at high magnetic fields ( @xmath26 ) is significantly larger than its low - field value @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> our data imply that there is an _ </S>",
    "<S> additional _ charge transfer which is of the order of @xmath49 @xmath12 and occurs from the bottom- to the top - layer at intermediate _ </S>",
    "<S> b_. the origin of this charge transfer is the mismatch between the ground - state energies of the two layers that have unequal densities but are in thermal equilibrium , and the requirement that the lowest landau levels of the two layers have to align at high magnetic fields when both layers are in the extreme quantum limit . in a simple , capacitive model , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this charge transfer is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the difference between the layer densities , @xmath52 is the distance between the charge distribution peaks of the two layers , and @xmath53 is the gaas / alas dielectric constant . while this simple model gives the correct order of magnitude for the observed charge transfer , it does not quantitatively explain its size nor its dependence on @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the details of this subtle charge transfer are very interesting on their own as they reflect a delicate balance between interaction at intermediate _ </S>",
    "<S> b _ and the capacitive energy associated with interlayer charge transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this charge transfer has no bearing on our analysis of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 data or our conclusions because our determination of the cf and wc layer densities is based on direct measurements of @xmath26 ( from the positions of fqhe minima near @xmath22 ) and @xmath29 ( from shubnikov - de haas oscillations at low field ) , and the reasonable assumption that @xmath54 .    returning to the commensurability data , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) we show additional traces taken near the depletion of the bottom - layer . for each trace </S>",
    "<S> we indicate @xmath27 and also mark the expected positions of commensurability resistance maxima based on @xmath26 and @xmath27 for that trace . in a narrow range of @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> oscillatory features are seen . for these traces , </S>",
    "<S> the position of the expected @xmath35 maximum matches remarkably well the strong peak observed to the left of @xmath22 ( @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that experiments on commensurability of cfs in an anti - dot lattice also show that the resistance maximum is more pronounced for @xmath56 compared to @xmath57 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this asymmetry is , however , not known . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the data of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , in some traces of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) there are also hints of weak resistance maxima , closer to @xmath22 compared to the @xmath35 commensurability maxima . </S>",
    "<S> these could signal the commensurability of larger cf cyclotron orbits ( @xmath58 and 7 ) with the wc periodic potential . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) traces , for @xmath59 @xmath12 , there are also strong @xmath21 maxima observed to the left of the @xmath35 triangles ( see up - arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) ) . we do not know the origin of these anomalous maxima ; they might indicate the resonance of a ( small ) cf cyclotron orbit that fits _ inside _ three adjacent lattice points . </S>",
    "<S> we note that anomalous shoulders at fields highers than the @xmath35 resistance maximum are also seen in some commensurability data in anti - dot samples ; see , e.g. , traces 1 and 2 * in fig . 2 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have assumed that the wc attains a triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed generally conjectured for a fully spin - polarized wc @xcite . near the 114-mk - trace in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , we have included marks ( diamonds ) for the expected positions of resistance maxima if the wc lattice were square instead of triangular . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the positions of the triangles agree with the experimental data better than those of the squares .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the temperature dependent data of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) indicate the disappearance of the oscillatory resistance features above @xmath60 mk , signaling a melting of the wc . </S>",
    "<S> a melting temperature of @xmath61 mk is comparable to but somewhat smaller than those reported from various measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting , however , that the wc density in our sample ( @xmath62 1.7 @xmath63 @xmath12 at @xmath64 v ) is about an order of magnitude smaller than the densities in previous measurements . also , it is possible that the cfs in the top - layer , which is only @xmath65 nm away , screen and reduce the coulomb interaction between the electrons in the wc layer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such screening would lead to a lower wc melting temperature .    before closing , we remark on data we obtained from large ( 4 mm x 4 mm ) van der pauw samples . </S>",
    "<S> such samples exhibit more pronounced resistance maxima near @xmath22 , some of which can be assigned to the commensurability of top - layer cf cyclotron orbits with the potential of a wc formed in the bottom - layer . </S>",
    "<S> the wc layer density deduced from this assignment , however , is typically much smaller ( by a factor of up to  4 ) than the bottom - layer density we obtain from our layer density measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy might stem from the non - uniformity of the layer densities in van der pauw samples whose area is about 100 times larger than the hall bar samples presented here . </S>",
    "<S> we note that density uniformity is especially important in our experiments because the wc layer density has to be extremely small ( of the order of @xmath66 @xmath12 ) so that the cf commensurability condition is satisfied very near @xmath22 , i.e. , far from the fqhe minima .    </S>",
    "<S> our results offer a direct look at the microscopic structure of the magnetic - field - induced wc in 2dess . </S>",
    "<S> they also raise several intriguing questions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , what is the exact shape of the periodic potential modulation that the wc layer imposes on the cfs ? </S>",
    "<S> a related question is the optimum interlayer distance that would lead to the most pronounced @xmath21 commensurability maxima . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the weak periodic potential imposed by the wc and the homogeneous _ effective _ magnetic field @xmath3 can conspire to also lead to a fractal energy diagram ( the hofstadter s butterfly ) @xcite for the of cfs , similar to what has been studied for _ electrons _ in an externally imposed periodic potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our technique might find use in studying other possibly ordered , broken - symmetry states of 2dess . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we envision measurements where the cfs in one layer are used to probe , in an adjacent layer , the anisotropic phases that are observed at half - filled landau levels with high index @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these anisotropic phases are believed to signal many - body states , consisting of stripes of electrons with alternating density ( filling ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the stripes are periodic , they would generate a one - dimensional periodic potential in the nearby cf layer , and the cfs should exhibit commensurability features . </S>"
