    "consensus problems of multi - agent systems have attracted broad attentions from various contexts ( see @xcite-@xcite ) . in general , the main objective of consensus problems is to make all agents converge to some common state by designing proper algorithms . for this purpose ,",
    "various consensus algorithms have been proposed @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the results of almost all previous works were concerned with consensus with a common consistent state , while we are considering cluster consensus , i.e. , agents in networks are divided into several disjoint groups , called _ clusters _",
    ", in the sense that all agents in the same cluster completely synchronize but the dynamics in different clusters does not coincide . in reality , a number of practical models can be transformed into this cluster consensus problem , for instance , social learning network under different environments @xcite . social learning focuses on the opinion dynamics in the society ,",
    "in which individuals engage in communication with their neighbors in order to learn from their experiences .",
    "consider that the belief of each individual is affected by different religious beliefs or cultural backgrounds .",
    "this affection flags the clusters that each individual belongs to . in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the authors considered cluster ( group ) synchronization ( consensus ) problems of networks with multi - agents . in @xcite , for linearly coupled multi - agents systems , the authors derived conditions on coupling matrix to guarantee group consensus(intra - cluster synchronization ) , but the inter - cluster separation was not considered . in @xcite , agents in different clusters have different dynamics of uncoupled node systems , the inter - cluster separation was not proved rigorously ( but only assumed ) . since it is quite difficult to prove inter - cluster separation for general nonlinear coupled systems ( up to now , no way to prove ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the dynamics of nodes are special , hence , the final states of agents can be given directly . in this paper , in this paper , the inter - cluster separation is actually one of main aims , which is realized by imposing the inter - cluster different , intra - cluster identical inputs .    in our previous paper @xcite , we investigated cluster consensus problem in discrete - time networks of multi - agents , which provided the basic ideas .",
    "however , there still is big difference between discrete - time networks and continuous - time system .",
    "in addition , in comparison with @xcite , in the present paper , the static inter - cluster influence matrix in @xcite is replaced by time - varying inter - cluster influence matrix sequence ; the assumption of existence of self - links in @xcite are removed ; the formation of inputs to a more general scenario are extended , while @xcite considered that the inputs among different clusters only differ by a proportionality constant . finally , the concepts relating graph theory are generalized , too .",
