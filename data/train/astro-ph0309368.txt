    "five years ago , the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) and the high - z supernova search team both presented studies of distant type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) in a series of reports , which gave strong evidence for an acceleration of the universe s expansion , and hence for a non - zero cosmological constant , or dark energy density ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review , see perlmutter & schmidt 2003 ) .",
    "these results ruled out a flat , matter - dominated ( , ) universe .",
    "for a flat universe , motivated by inflation theory , these studies yielded a value for the cosmological constant of @xmath10 . even in the absence of assumptions about the geometry of the universe ,",
    "the supernova measurements indicate the existence of dark energy with greater than 99% confidence .",
    "the supernova results combined with observations of the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the properties of massive clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dynamical redshift - space distortions @xcite yield a consistent picture of a flat universe with @xmath11 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "each of these measurements is sensitive to different combinations of the parameters , and hence they complement each other .",
    "moreover , because there are three different measurements of two parameters , the combination provides an important consistency check .",
    "while the current observations of galaxy clusters and dynamics , and of high - redshift supernovae , primarily probe the `` recent '' universe at redshifts of @xmath12 , the cmb measurements probe the early universe at @xmath13 .",
    "that consistent results are obtained by measurements of vastly different epochs of the universe s history suggests a vindication of the standard model of the expanding universe .    in the redshift range around ,",
    "the supernova results are most sensitive to a linear combination of @xmath0  and @xmath1close to @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , galaxy clustering and dynamics are sensitive primarily to @xmath15 alone , while the cmb is most sensitive to @xmath16 . although combinations of other measurements lead to a separate confirmation of the universe s acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , taken alone it is the supernovae that provide the best _ direct _ evidence for dark energy . therefore , it is of importance to improve the precision of the supernova result , to confirm the result with additional independent high - redshift supernovae , and also to limit the possible effects of systematic errors .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented extensive accounts of , and bounds for , possible systematic uncertainties in the supernova measurements .",
    "one obvious possible source of systematic uncertainty is the effect of host - galaxy dust . for a given mass density ,",
    "the effect of a cosmological constant on the magnitudes of high - redshift supernovae is to make their observed brightnesses _ dimmer _ than would have been the case with .",
    "dust extinction from within the host galaxy of the high - redshift supernovae could have a similar effect ; however , normal dust will also redden the colors of the supernovae .",
    "therefore , a measurement of the color of the high - redshift supernovae , compared to the known colors of low - redshift sne  ia , has been used to provide an upper limit on the effect of host - galaxy dust extinction , or a direct measurement of that extinction which may then be corrected .",
    "uncertainties on extinction corrections based on these color measurements usually dominate the statistical error of photometric measurements .",
    "previous analyses have either selected a low - extinction subset of both low- and high - redshift supernovae and not applied corrections directly ( `` fit c , '' the primary analysis of p99 ) , or have used an asymmetric bayesian prior on the intrinsic extinction distribution to limit the propagated uncertainties from errors in color measurements ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  fit e  of p99 ) .    in @xcite , we set stronger limits on the effects of host - galaxy extinction by comparing the extinction , cosmological parameters , and supernova peak magnitude dispersion for subsets of the scp supernovae observed in different types of host galaxies , as identified from both hst imaging and keck spectroscopy of the hosts .",
    "we found that supernovae in early - type ( e and s0 ) galaxies show a smaller dispersion in peak magnitude at high redshift , as had previously been seen at low redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this subset of the p99 sample  in hosts unlikely to be strongly affected by extinction  independently provided evidence at the @xmath17 level that @xmath18 in a flat universe and confirmed that host - galaxy dust extinction was unlikely to be a significant systematic in the results of p99 , as had been suggested previously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the natural next step following the work of @xcite  presented in the current paper  is to provide high - quality individual unbiased  measurements that allow us to directly measure the effect of host - galaxy extinction on each supernova event without resorting to a prior on the color excess distribution .",
    "the current paper presents eleven new supernovae discovered and observed by the scp at redshifts @xmath19 , a range very similar to that of the 42 high - redshift supernovae reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p99 ) .",
    "the supernovae of that paper , with one exception , were observed entirely with ground - based telescopes ; 11 of the 14 new supernovae reported by @xcite were also observed from the ground .",
    "the eleven supernovae of this work have lightcurves in both the @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands measured with the wide - field / planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and represent the largest sample to date of hst - measured sne  ia at high redshift .",
    "the hst provides two primary advantages for photometry of point sources such as supernovae .",
    "first the sky background is much lower , allowing a much higher signal - to - noise ratio in a single exposure .",
    "second , because the telescope is not limited by atmospheric seeing , it has very high spatial resolution .",
    "this helps the signal - to - noise ratio by greatly reducing the area of background emission which contributes to the noise of the source measurement , and moreover simplifies the task of separating the variable supernova signal from the host galaxy . with these advantages ,",
    "the precision of the lightcurve and color measurements is much greater for the eleven supernovae in this paper than was possible for previous ground - based observations .",
    "these eleven supernovae themselves provide a high - precision _ new _ set of high - redshift supernovae to test the accelerating universe results .",
    "moreover , the higher precision lightcurve measurements in both @xmath20- and @xmath21-bands allow us to make high - quality , unbiased , individual host - galaxy extinction corrections to each supernova event .",
    "we first describe the psf - fit photometry method used for extracting the lightcurves from the wfpc2  images (   [ sec : hstphotometry ] ) .",
    "next , in   [ sec : lightcurvefits ] , we describe the lightcurve fitting procedure , including the methods used for calculating accurate @xmath22-corrections .",
    "so that all supernovae may be treated consistently , in ",
    "[ sec : colorcor ] we apply the slightly updated @xmath22-correction procedure to all of the supernovae used in p99 . in ",
    "[ sec : cosmofitmethod ] , the cosmological fit methodology we use is described . in   [ sec : colorsandextinction ] , we discuss the evidence for host - galaxy extinction ( only significant for three of the eleven new supernovae ) from the @xmath20-@xmath21 lightcurve colors . in ",
    "[ sec : cosmoparam ] , we present the measurements of the cosmological parameters @xmath0  and @xmath1  from the new dataset alone as well as combining this set with the data of p99 . in   [ sec : combined ] , we perform a combined fit with our data and the high - redshift sne of @xcite . finally , in   [",
    "sec : w ] we present measurements of @xmath2 , the dark energy equation of state parameter , from these data , and from these data combined with recent cmb and galaxy redshift distortion measurements .",
    "these discussions of our primary results are followed by updated analyses of systematic uncertainties for these measurements in ",
    "[ sec : systematic ] .",
    "the supernovae discussed in this paper are listed in table  [ tab : snlist ] .",
    "they were discovered during three different supernova searches , following the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "two of the searches were conducted with the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , in november / december 1997 and march / april 1998 .",
    "the final search was conducted at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) on mauna kea in hawaii in april / may 2000 . in each case , 23 nights of reference images were followed 34 weeks later by 23 nights of search images .",
    "the two images of each search field were seeing - matched and subtracted , and were searched for residuals indicating a supernova candidate .",
    "weather conditions limited the depth and hence the redshift range of the march / april 1998 search .",
    "out of the three searches , eleven of the resulting supernova discoveries were followed with extensive hst photometry .",
    "these supernovae are spaced approximately evenly in the redshift range @xmath23 .",
    "nine out of the eleven supernovae were discovered very close to maximum light ; two were discovered several days before maximum light .",
    "spectra were obtained with the red side of lris on the keck 10 m telescope @xcite , with fors1 on antu ( vlt - ut1 ) @xcite , and with efosc2 on the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "these spectra were used to confirm the identification of the candidates as sne  ia , and to measure the redshift of each candidate .",
    "nine of the eleven supernovae in the set have strong confirmation as type  ia through the presence of  @xmath246150 ,  @xmath244190 , or features that match those of a type  ia observed at a similar epoch . and",
    "1998be have spectra which are consistent with sne  ia spectra , although this identification is less secure for those two .",
    "however , we note that the colors ( measured at multiple epochs with the hst lightcurves ) are inconsistent with other non - ia types .",
    "( we explore the systematic effect of removing those two supernovae from the set in   [ sec : typecontamination ] . )",
    "where possible , the redshift , @xmath25 , of each candidate was measured by matching narrow features in the host galaxy of the supernovae ; the precision of these measurements in @xmath25 is typically 0.001 . in cases",
    "where there were not sufficient host - galaxy features ( and 1998ba ) , redshifts were measured from the supernova itself ; in these cases , @xmath25 is measured with a ( conservative ) precision of 0.01 @xcite . even in the latter case ,",
    "redshift measurements do not contribute significantly to the uncertainties in the final cosmological measurements since these are dominated by the photometric uncertainties .",
    "each of these supernovae was imaged with two broadband filters using the planetary camera ( pc ) ccd of the wfpc2  on the hst , which has a scale of 0.046@xmath26/pixel .",
    "table  [ tab : snlist ] lists the dates of these observations .",
    "the f675w and f814w broadband filters were chosen to have maximum sensitivity to these faint objects , while being as close a match as practical to the rest - frame @xmath27 and @xmath28 filters at the targeted redshifts .",
    "( note that all of our wfpc2  observing parameters except the exact target coordinates were fixed prior to the supernova discoveries . )",
    "the effective system transmission curves provided by stsci indicate that , when used with wfpc2 , f675w is most similar to ground - based @xmath20 band while f814w is most similar to ground - based @xmath21 band .",
    "these filters roughly correspond to redshifted @xmath27- and @xmath28-band filters for the supernovae at @xmath29 , and redshifted @xmath30- and @xmath27- band filters for the supernovae at @xmath31 .",
    "the hst images were reduced through the standard hst `` on - the - fly reprocessing '' data reduction pipeline provided by the space telescope science institute .",
    "images were then background subtracted , and images taken in the same orbit were combined to reject cosmic rays using the `` crrej '' procedure ( a part of the stsdas iraf package ) .",
    "photometric fluxes were extracted from the final images using a psf - fitting procedure .",
    "traditional psf fitting procedures assume a single isolated point source above a constant background . in this case , the point source was superimposed on the image of the host galaxy . in all cases ,",
    "the supernova image was separated from the core of the host galaxy ; however , in most cases the separation was not enough that an annular measurement of the background would be accurate .",
    "because the host - galaxy flux is the same in all of the images , we used a psf fitting procedure that fits a psf _ simultaneously _ to every image of a given supernova observed through a given photometric filter .",
    "the model we fit was :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the measured flux in pixel @xmath34 of the @xmath35th image , ( @xmath36 ) is the position of the supernova on the @xmath35th image , @xmath37 is the total flux in the supernova in the @xmath35th image , @xmath38 is a normalized point spread function , @xmath39 is a temporally constant background parametrized by @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is a pedestal offset for the @xmath35th image .",
    "there are @xmath42 parameters in this model , where @xmath43 is the number of images ( typically 2 , 5 , or 6 previously summed images ) and @xmath44 is the number of parameters @xmath40 that specify the background model ( typically 3 or 6 ) .",
    "( the @xmath45 is due to the fact that a zeroth - order term in the background is degenerate with one of the @xmath41 terms . )",
    "parameters varied include @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 .",
    "due to the scarcity of objects in our pc images , geometric transformations between the images at different epochs using other objects on the four chips of wfpc2  together allowed an _ a priori _ determination of @xmath49 good to @xmath50  pixel . allowing those parameters to vary in the fit ( effectively , using the point source signature of the supernova to determine the offset of the image ) provided position measurements a factor of @xmath51 better.% of the product of the positional uncertainty and the flux uncertainty , so the effects of this bias will be very small in comparison to our photometric errors . ]",
    "the model was fit to @xmath52 pixel patches extracted from all of the images of a time sequence of a single supernova in a single filter ( except for sn1998ay , which is close enough to the host galaxy that a @xmath53 pixel patch was used to avoid having to fit the core of the galaxy with the background model ) . in four out",
    "of the 99 patches used in the fits to the 22 lightcurves , a single bad pixel was masked from the fit .",
    "the series of @xmath37 values , corrected as described in the rest of this section , provided the data used in the lightcurve fits described in   [ sec : lightcurvefits ] . for one supernova ( at ) , the f814w background was further constrained by a supernova - free `` final reference '' image taken 11 months after the supernova explosion .",
    "a single tiny tim psf was used as @xmath38 for all images of a given filter .",
    "the tiny tim psf used was subsampled to @xmath54 subpixels ; in the fit procedure , it was shifted and integrated ( properly summing fractional subpixels ) .",
    "after shifting and resampling to the pc pixel scale , it was convolved with an empirical @xmath55 electron diffusion kernel with 75% of the flux in the central element @xcite .",
    "the psf was normalized in a @xmath56-radius aperture , chosen to match the standard zeropoint calibration @xcite .",
    "although the use of a single psf for every image is an approximation  the psf of wfpc2depends on the epoch of the observation as well as the position on the ccd  this approximation should be valid , especially given that for all of the observations the supernova was positioned close to the center of the pc . to verify that this approximation is valid ,",
    "we reran the psf fitting procedure with individually generated psfs for most supernovae ; we also explored using a supernova spectrum instead of a standard star spectrum in generating the psf .",
    "the measured fluxes were not significantly different , showing differences in both directions generally within 12% of the supernova peak flux value  much less than our photometric uncertainties on individual data points .",
    "although one of the great advantages of the hubble space telescope is its low background , ccd photometry of faint objects over a low background suffer from an imperfect charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) effect , which can lead to a systematic underestimate of the flux of point sources @xcite . on the pc",
    ", these effects can be as large as @xmath57% .",
    "the measured flux values ( @xmath37 above ) were corrected for the cte of wfpc2  following the standard procedure of @xcite .",
    "uncertainties on the cte corrections were propagated into the corrected supernova fluxes , although in all cases these uncertainties were smaller than the uncertainties in the raw measured flux values . because the host galaxy is a smooth background underneath the point source , it was considered as a contribution to the background in the cte correction . for an image which was a combination of several separate exposures within the same orbit or orbits , the cte calculation was performed assuming that each sn image had a measured sn flux whose fraction of the total flux was equal to the fraction of that individual image s exposure time to the summed image s total exposure time .",
    "this assumption is correct most of the time , with the exception of the few instances where earthshine affects part of an orbit .",
    "in addition to the hst data , there exists ground - based photometry for each of these supernovae .",
    "this includes the images from the search itself , as well as a limited amount of follow - up .",
    "the details of which supernovae were observed with which telescopes are given with the lightcurves in appendix  [ sec : dirtylaundry ] .",
    "ground - based photometric fluxes were extracted from images using the same aperture photometry procedure of p99 .",
    "a complete lightcurve in a given filter ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) combined the hst data with the ground - based data ( using the color - correction procedure described below in   [ sec : colorcor ] ) , using measured zeropoints for the ground - based data and the vega zeropoints of @xcite for the hst data .",
    "the uncertainties on those zeropoints ( 0.003 for f814w or 0.006 for f675w ) were added as correlated errors between all hst data points when combining with the ground - based lightcurve .",
    "similarly , the measured uncertainty in the ground - based zeropoint was added as a correlated error to all ground - based fluxes .",
    "ground - based photometric calibrations were based on observations of @xcite standard stars observed on the same photometric night as a supernova observation ; each calibration is confirmed over two or more nights .",
    "ground - based zeropoint uncertainties are generally @xmath580.03 ; the @xmath20-band ground based zeropoint for is only good to @xmath59 .",
    "we have compared our ground - based aperture photometry with our hst psf - fitting photometry using the limited number of sufficiently bright stars present in the pc across the eleven sne fields .",
    "we find the difference between the hst and ground - based photometry to be in both the r- and i - bands , consistent with no offset .",
    "the correlated uncertainties between different supernovae arising from ground - based zeropoints based on the same calibration data , and between the hst supernovae ( which all share the same zeropoint ) , were included in the covariance matrix used in all cosmological fits ( see   [ sec : cosmofitmethod ] ) .",
    "it is the magnitude of the supernova at its lightcurve peak that serves as a `` calibrated candle '' in estimating the cosmological parameters from the luminosity distance relationship . to estimate this peak magnitude , we performed template fits to the time series of photometric data for each supernova .",
    "in addition to the eleven supernovae described here , lightcurve fits were also performed to the supernovae from p99 , including 18 supernovae from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h96 ) , and eight from ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter r99 ) which match the same selection criteria used for the h96 supernovae ( having data within six days of maximum light and located at , limiting distance modulus error due to peculiar velocities to less than 0.15 magnitudes ) .",
    "because of new templates and @xmath22-corrections ( see below ) , lightcurve fits to the supernovae from h96 and p99 used in the analyses below were redone for consistency .",
    "the results of these fits are slightly different from those quoted in p99 for the same supernovae as a result of the change in the lightcurve template , the new @xmath22-corrections , and the different fit procedure , all discussed below .",
    "for example , because the measured  value was considered in the @xmath22-corrections (   [ sec : colorcor ] ) , whereas it was not in p99 , one should expect to see randomly distributed differences in fit supernova lightcurve parameters due to scatter in the color measurements .",
    "lightcurve fits were performed using a @xmath60-minimization procedure based on minuit @xcite . for both high- and low - redshift supernovae ,",
    "color corrections and @xmath22-corrections are applied ( see   [ sec : colorcor ] ) to the photometric data .",
    "these data were then fit to lightcurve templates .",
    "fits were performed to the combined @xmath20- and @xmath21-band data for each high - redshift supernova .",
    "for low - redshift supernovae , fits were performed using only the @xmath27- and @xmath28-band data ( which correspond to de - redshifted @xmath20- and @xmath21-bands for most of the high - redshift supernovae ) .",
    "the lightcurve model fit to the supernova has four parameters to modify the lightcurve templates : time of rest - frame @xmath27-band maximum light , peak flux in @xmath20 , @xmath20-@xmath21 color at the epoch of rest - frame maximum @xmath27-band light , and timescale stretch @xmath61 .",
    "stretch is a parameter which linearly scales the time axis , so that a supernova with a high stretch has a relatively slow decay from maximum , and a supernova with a low stretch has a relatively fast decay from maximum @xcite .",
    "for supernovae in the redshift range , a @xmath27 template was fit to the @xmath20-band lightcurve and a @xmath28 template was fit to the @xmath21-band lightcurve .",
    "for supernovae at @xmath31 , a @xmath30 template was fit to the @xmath20-band lightcurve and a @xmath27 template to the @xmath21-band lightcurve .",
    "two of the high - redshift supernovae from p99 fall at @xmath62 ( and ) ; for these supernovae , @xmath28 and @xmath20 templates were fit to the @xmath20- and @xmath21-band data .",
    "( the peak @xmath27-band magnitude was extracted by adding the intrinsic sn  ia  @xmath27-@xmath28 color to the fit @xmath28-band magnitude at the epoch of @xmath27 maximum . )",
    "the @xmath27 template used in the lightcurve fits was that of @xcite .",
    "for this paper , new @xmath28-band and @xmath20-band templates were generated following a procedure similar to that of @xcite , by fitting a smooth parametrized curve through the low - redshift supernova data of h96 and r99 .",
    "a new @xmath30-band template was generated with data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; comparison of our @xmath30-band template shows good agreement with the new @xmath30-band photometry from @xcite at the relevant epochs .",
    "new templates were generated by fitting a smooth curve , @xmath63 , to the low - redshift lightcurve data , where @xmath64 ; @xmath65 is the number of observer - frame days relative to the epoch of the @xmath27-band maximum of each supernova , @xmath25 is the redshift of each supernova , and @xmath61 is the stretch of each supernova as measured from the @xmath27-band lightcurves .",
    "lightcurve templates had an initial parabola with a 20-day rise time @xcite , joined to a smooth spline section to describe the main part of the lightcurve , then joined to an exponential decay to describe the final tail at @xmath66  days past maximum light .",
    "the first 100 days of each of the three templates is listed in table  [ tab : ltcvtemplates ] .    due to a secondary `` hump '' or",

    ". however , for the two @xmath62 supernova to which we fit an @xmath20-band template , the peak @xmath20- and @xmath21- band magnitudes are well constrained , and the stretch is also well measured from the rest - frame @xmath28-band lightcurve .",
    "some of the high - redshift supernovae from p99 lack a supernova - free host - galaxy image .",
    "these supernovae were fit with an additional variable parameter : the zero - level of the i - band lightcurve .",
    "the supernovae treated in this manner include , 1997q , 1997r , and 1997am .",
    "the late - time lightcurve behavior may bias the result of a lightcurve fit @xcite ; it is therefore important that the low- and high - redshift supernovae are treated in as consistent a manner as possible .",
    "few or none of the high - redshift supernovae have high - precision measurements more than @xmath684050 rest - frame days after maximum light , so as in @xcite and p99 these late - time points were eliminated from the low - redshift lightcurve data before the template - fit procedure . additionally , to allow for systematic offset uncertainties on the host - galaxy subtraction , an `` error floor '' of 0.007 times the maximum lightcurve flux was applied ; any lightcurve point with an uncertainty below the error floor had its uncertainty replaced by that value @xcite .",
    "the final results of the lightcurve fits , including the effect of color corrections and @xmath22-corrections , are listed in table  [ tab : hstsnefits ] for the eleven supernovae of this paper .",

    "note that there are correlated errors between all of the ground - based points for each supernova in these figures , as a single ground - based zeropoint was used to scale each of them together with the hst photometry .      in order to combine data from different telescopes ,",
    "color corrections were applied to remove the differences in the spectral responses of the filters relative to the bessell system @xcite . for the ground - based telescopes , the filters are close enough to the standard bessell filters that a single linear color term ( measured at each observatory with standard stars ) suffices to put the data onto the bessell system , with most corrections being smaller than 0.01 magnitudes .",
    "the wfpc2  filters are different enough from the ground - based filters , however , that a linear term is not sufficient .",
    "moreover , the differences between a sn  ia  and standard star spectral energy distribution are significant . in this case ,",
    "color corrections were calculated by integrating template sn  ia  spectra ( described below ) through the system response .    in order to perform lightcurve template fitting , a cross - filter @xmath22-correction must be applied to transform the data in the observed filter into a rest - frame magnitude in the filter used for the lightcurve template @xcite .",
    "the color correction to the nearest standard bessell filter followed by a @xmath22-correction to a rest - frame filter is equivalent to a direct @xmath22-correction from the observed filter to the standard rest - frame filter . in practice , we perform the two steps separately so that all photometry may be combined to provide a lightcurve effectively observed through a standard ( e.g. @xmath20-band ) filter , which may then be fit with a single series of @xmath22-corrections .",

    "the spectral template used in this present work began with the template of that paper .",
    "to it was applied a smooth multiplicative function at each day such that integration of the spectrum through the standard filters would produce the proper intrinsic colors for a type  ia supernova ( including a mild dependence of those intrinsic colors on stretch ) .",

    "in other words , these systematic effects produce a larger uncertainty in @xmath16 than in @xmath14 ( or , equivalently , in a measurement of @xmath15 or @xmath106 alone under the assumption of a flat universe ) .",
    "this means that systematic effects do not currently hamper the cosmological measurements from supernovae where they have the greatest weight relative to other techniques , nor do they significantly diminish the direct evidence from supernovae for the presence of dark energy .",

    "there are multiple reasonable choices for lightcurve fitting methods which yield slightly different results for the lightcurve parameters . for the supernovae in p99 ,",
    "the @xmath20-band data on high - redshift supernovae provided much stronger limits on the stretch ( the shape of the lightcurve ) than did more sparse @xmath21-band lightcurves . for consistency , in p99 the stretch values for the low - redshift supernovae",
    "were therefore measured using only the @xmath27-band lightcurves .    in this paper , there are high - quality photometric measurements from wfpc2  in both @xmath20 and @xmath21 bands .",
    "thus , data in both colors contribute significantly to the constraints on stretch .",
    "additionally , photometry is extracted from hst and ground - based images in very different apertures , meaning that different amounts of host galaxy light will be included ; this background must be subtracted from each before the two are combined . as such , it is more appropriate to fit these supernovae with fixed rather than floating lightcurve zero offsets . as this is the most appropriate fit method for the hst supernovae , the low - redshift supernovae should be treated consistently .",
    "these procedures which are most appropriate for the hst supernovae were used for all new fits performed in this paper , and listed in tables  [ tab : hstsnefits ] through [ tab : lowzsnefits ] .    to estimate the size of the effect due to these differences in fitting method , cosmological confidence intervals were generated from the `` case c '' subset of p99 using the new fits presented in this paper and compared to the results quoted in p99 and other variations on the fitting method .",
    "differences in the fit method can change the flat - universe value of @xmath0  by @xmath680.03 , and the value of @xmath16 by up to @xmath680.8 .",
    "( this is still much less than the major - axis extent of the statistical confidence ellipse in this direction . )",
    "we use these values as the `` fit - method '' systematic uncertainties .",
    "we similarly performed joint fits to @xmath127 in the flat - universe , constant-@xmath2 case to the supernovae from p99 with different lightcurve fit methodologies , and from these fits we adopt a fit - method systematic uncertainty of 0.02 on constant @xmath2 ( once combined with measurements from 2dfgrs and the cmb ) .",
    "we have also performed a fit without any stretch correction at all , i.e. using fixed @xmath133 .",
    "although the quality of the fit is worse ( @xmath134 with 54 supernovae , in comparison to @xmath135 from fit  3 ) , it yields consistent cosmological results , with shifts ( ) much smaller than the already - adopted `` fit method '' systematic .",
    "we have likewise performed a fit to the complete set of supernovae ( including all from p99 with measured colors ) .",
    "the fit cosmological values are similarly consistent with the primary low - extinction fit .",
    "we therefore conclude that the effects of these choices are subsumed in the `` fit method '' systematic .",
    "all subsets of supernovae used for cosmological fits in this paper omit supernovae for which there is not a spectral confirmation of the supernova type .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible in some cases where that confirmation is weak that we may have contamination from non - type  ia supernovae . to estimate such an effect , we performed fits using only those supernovae which have a firm identification as type  ia ; this is the `` strict - ia subset '' from   [ sec : subsets ] .",
    "the comparison between our primary fit ( fit 3 ) and this fit with a more stringent type cut is shown in row ( a ) of figure  [ fig : systematic ] .",
    "this fit has a value of @xmath0  in a flat universe which is 0.03 higher than that of fit 3 .",

    "as most of our supernovae are from flux - limited samples , they will suffer malmquist bias @xcite .",
    "this effect was discussed extensively in p99 , and here we update that discussion to include our new hst sne  ia .",
    "for the measurement of the cosmological parameters , it is the difference between the malmquist bias of the low - redshift and high - redshift samples which matters . in particular , the apparent probability of @xmath18",
    "is enhanced only if the low - redshift supernovae suffer more malmquist bias than the high - redshift supernovae , as this makes the high - redshift sne  ia seem fainter .",
    "the p99 high - redshift dataset was estimated to have little malmquist bias ( 0.01  mag ) because the sn discovery magnitudes were decorrelated with the measured peak magnitudes . however , for the new hst sample , nine of the eleven sne  ia ( selected from larger samples of supernovae found in the searches ) were found almost exactly at maximum light .",
    "this may reflect a spectroscopic flux limit superimposed on the original search flux limit since only spectroscopically confirmed sne  ia were considered , and of those , generally the higher redshift sne  ia from a given search were chosen for hst for follow - up .",
    "in particular , the sne  ia selected for follow - up from the fall 1997 search were all found at maximum light , while all but sn  1998aw from the spring 1998 search were found at maximum light .",
    "sn  2000fr was found well before maximum .",
    "thus , the new high - redshift dataset is likely to suffer more malmquist bias than the p99 dataset . further complicating the interpretation for the high - redshift supernovae is the fact that our new hst supernovae are spread over a wide range in redshift , such that a single brightness correction for malmquist bias causes a more complicated change in the fitted cosmological parameters",
    "this is unlike the situation in p99 in which most supernovae were at @xmath137 . following the calculation in p99 for a high - redshift flux - limited sn sample",
    "we estimate that the maximum malmquist bias for the ensemble of hst supernovae is @xmath138  mag .",
    "however , we caution that it is supernovae near the flux limit which are most strongly biased , and therefore , that a subsample comprised of the highest - redshift members drawn from a larger flux - limited sample will be more biased . when combined with the p99 high - redshift supernovae , the bias is likely to be @xmath139  mag since both samples have roughly the same statistical weight .    as for the low - redshift sne  ia ,",
    "in p99 we established that since most of the sne  ia from the h96 flux - limited search were found near maximum , that sample suffered about 0.04  mag of malmquist bias .",
    "on the other hand , some of the r99 sne  ia were discovered using a galaxy - targeted technique , which therefore is not limited by the sn flux and may be more akin to a volume - limited sample @xcite .",
    "thus , the addition of the r99 sne  ia could slightly reduce the overall malmquist bias of the low - redshift sample . if we were to assume no malmquist bias for the r99 sne  ia , and allowing for the fact that they contribute only @xmath140 the statistical weight of the h96 supernovae , we estimate that the malmquist bias in the current low - redshift sample is roughly 0.03  mag .    since malmquist bias results in the selection of overly - bright supernovae at the limits of a flux - limited survey , and",
    "since the flux - limit can be strongly correlated with redshift , this bias can result in an apparent distortion of the shape of the hubble diagram .",
    "this may affect estimates of the dark energy equation of state .",
    "the selection effects for the current high - redshift supernovae are not sufficiently well - defined to warrant a more detailed modeling of this effect than is presented here .",
    "however , for future work , much better control of the selection criteria for sne  ia at both low- and high - redshift will be required in order to properly estimate the impact of this small bias .    for the current study",
    ", however , we simply note that since the _ differences _ in the malmquist biases of the high- and low - redshift subsets of sn are likely to be _ smaller _ in this work than in p99 , the current results are less likely to be affected by malmquist bias .",
    "given the above estimates of 0.03  mag of bias in the low - redshift sample , and 0.02  mag of bias in the high - redshift sample , the _ difference _ in the biases is only 0.01  mag . to perform a quantitative estimate of the effects of malmquist bias , we have performed a fit by applying the mean offsets described above to each member of a sample in our primary subset . this fit is plotted in figure  [ fig : systematic]b .",
    "the h96 supernovae have their magnitudes increased ( made dimmer ) by 0.04 , the p99 supernovae by 0.01 , and six of the eight hst supernovae in our primary subset have their magnitudes increased by 0.04 .",
    "the two hst supernovae ( , and 2000fr ) which were found before maximum light are assumed not to be biased , and the other nine are offset by 0.04 , yielding the above estimated 0.03 magnitudes for the sample .",
    "a fit with these changed values to the supernova peak magnitudes yields a flat - universe value which is different from our primary fit by @xmath141 , and a value of which is different by @xmath142 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath2 , when combined with the other cosmological measurements , is @xmath143 larger .",
    "we adopt these values  all much less than our statistical uncertainties  as our malmquist bias systematic error .",
    "the generation of the spectral template used for calculating @xmath22-corrections is described in   [ sec : colorcor ] . the degree to which uncertainties in the @xmath22-correction introduce systematic uncertainties into the cosmological parameters depends on whether or not extinction corrections are being individually applied to supernovae .",
    "in particular , our @xmath22-corrections are most uncertain in the rest - frame @xmath30-band range of the supernova spectrum , due to limited published spectrophotometry . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : lightcurvefits ] , our primary fits use a spectral template which has a color at the epoch of @xmath27-maximum .",
    "we have investigated the effects on our cosmology of replacing the spectral template used both for @xmath22-corrections and for determining color excesses with a template that has at the epoch of maximum @xmath27 light .",
    "figure  [ fig : systematic]c shows the effect on the fitted cosmology caused by using the different template for calculating @xmath22-corrections when individual host - galaxy extinction corrections are not applied .",
    "these effects are very mild , indicating that our @xmath22-corrections are robust with respect to the intrinsic @xmath30-@xmath27 color of a supernova .",
    "based on the comparison of these fits , we adopt a @xmath22-correction systematic uncertainty of 0.13 on @xmath16 and of 0.01 in @xmath2 ; the systematic uncertainty on the flat - universe value of @xmath0  due to this effect is negligible .",
    "although the effects of a different intrinsic @xmath30-@xmath27 color on the @xmath22-corrections are mild , the effects on calculated color excesses are much greater .",
    "figure  [ fig : systematic]d shows the difference between fit  6 , where host - galaxy extinction corrections have been applied using our standard color - excess values , and a fit where color - excess values have been determined assuming the intrinsic @xmath30-@xmath27 color of a supernova is @xmath144 at maximum light . as with other systematics , the primary effect is to move the confidence intervals along their major axis . in this case ,",
    "the large shift in @xmath16 is mainly due to the fact that with this bluer reference @xmath30-@xmath27 color , we would believe that all of our @xmath31 supernovae are suffering from an amount of host - galaxy extinction which is greater than that suffered by supernovae at lower redshift . given that the more distant supernovae are dimmer and thus closer to our detection limits than the moderate redshift supernovae , this scenario is implausible .",
    "if anything , one would expect the higher redshift supernovae to be _ less _ subject to host - galaxy extinction due to selection effects .",
    "nonetheless , a value of @xmath30-@xmath27=@xmath144 at the epoch of @xmath27-band maximum is currently possible given the @xmath30-band information available . only for those fits where extinction corrections are applied",
    ", we have an additional intrinsic @xmath30-@xmath27 systematic error of 0.07 on the flat - universe value of @xmath0 , and a systematic error of 1.78 on @xmath16 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on @xmath2 is 0.10 .",
    "it is likely that these values represent an overestimate of this systematic .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : colorsandextinction ] , @xcite found that some of the reddest supernovae at low redshift appear to be overcorrected for extinction given the standard reddening law .",
    "as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : hubs ] , our most reddened high - redshift supernova ( sn1998as , which is omitted from the primary subset ) is similarly overcorrected .",
    "one possible explanation is that a lower value of @xmath92 is appropriate for sn  ia host galaxies .",
    "if we use a value of @xmath145 @xcite rather than the standard value of @xmath146 to perform extinction corrections , it slightly changes the best - fit cosmological values for fits where extinction correction are applied ( fit 6 ) ; this change is shown in figure  [ fig : systematic]e .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath16 changes by 0.18 , and the best - fit value of @xmath2 when combined with the other cosmological measurements changes by 0.01 ; this systematic has a negligible effect on the flat - universe value of @xmath0 .",
    "a related source of systematic error is possible evolution in the properties of the host - galaxy dust . to examine the scale of the effect , we consider a situation where dust in spiral galaxies has a @xcite @xmath147 law whereas higher - redshift galaxy dust has a ratio of selective - to - total extinction that is half as large , i.e. @xmath148 .",
    "we use the monte carlo code described in @xcite to study the bias induced when an @xmath147 extinction correction is inappropriately applied to all supernovae .",
    "we incorporate the redshift and  distributions of the supernovae considered in this paper and an cut is applied . for an input cosmology of @xmath149 and @xmath150 , we find a modest shift in the cosmological parameters to @xmath151 and @xmath152 without assuming a flat universe .",
    "this bias moves almost exactly along the line @xmath153 , increasing uncertainty along the thin axis of the error contour .",
    "however , the extreme difference in dust properties considered in the monte carlo contributes a shift in the cosmological parameters that is less than 1 @xmath154 of our quoted statistical error bars .",
    "we adopt 0.04 as the `` dust evolution '' systematic uncertainty on @xmath15 in a flat universe for those fits where host - galaxy extinction corrections are applied ; this particular systematic is insignificant along the major axis of the confidence ellipses .    the flat - universe value of @xmath2 , when combined with the 2dfgrs and cmb results , increases by 0.06 under this simple model of dust evolution .",
    "we adopt this as the dust evolution systematic on @xmath2 for those fits where host - galaxy extinction corrections are applied .",
    "gravitational lensing decreases the modal brightness and causes increased dispersion and positive skewness in the hubble diagram for high - redshift supernovae .",
    "the size of the effect depends on the fraction of compact objects of the total mass density of the universe , @xmath0 .",
    "this has been discussed in some detail in the literature @xcite , especially in relation to the p99 and @xcite sn datasets . a very conservative assumption of an `` empty beam '' model in a universe filled with compact objects allowed p99 to demonstrate that gravitational lensing does not alter the case for dark energy .",
    "gravitational lensing may result in a biased determination of the cosmological parameter determination , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the potential bias increases with the redshift of the supernovae in the sample .",
    "for example , for the most distant known type  ia sn , sn1997ff at z=1.7 , there is evidence for significant magnification , @xmath155 @xcite .    as the sn sample considered in this paper",
    "does not reach as far , the ( de)magnification distortions are expected to be small , in general below 0.05 magnitudes , and less than 1% for the cases considered in p99 . to estimate the systematic uncertainties in the cosmological parameters we have used the snoc package @xcite to simulate 100 realizations of our data sets assuming a 20% universal fraction of @xmath156 in compact objects , i.e. of the same order as the halo fraction deduced for the milky way from microlensing along the line of sight to the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "the light beams are otherwise assumed to travel through space randomly filled with galaxy halos with mass density equally divided into sis and nfw profiles , as described in @xcite . according to our simulations we find that ( for a flat universe ) the fitted value of @xmath156 is systematically shifted by 0.01 on the average , with a statistical dispersion @xmath157 .",
    "we adopt 0.01 as our gravitational lensing systematic error in the flat - universe value of @xmath0 . the effect on @xmath16",
    "is very small compared to other systematics , biasing the sum by only 0.04 .    the simulated offsets due to gravitational lensing , when combined with cmb and galaxy redshift distortion measurements , increase the value of @xmath2 by 0.05 ; we adopt this as a gravitational lensing systematic on @xmath2 .",
    "in p99 we discussed in detail whether the high - redshift sne  ia could have systematically different properties than low - redshift sne  ia , and in particular , whether intrinsic differences might remain after correction for stretch .",
    "one might imagine this to occur if the range of the physical parameters controlling sn  ia brightnesses have little overlap between low- and high - redshift such that corrections applied to low - redshift are inappropriate or incomplete for high - redshift sne  ia .",
    "since p99 , considerable additional work has been done to address this issue .",
    "in addition to comparisons of stretch range ( p99 ) , as well as spectral @xcite and lightcurve @xcite features , several tests performed directly with the p99 high - redshift sne  ia have shown excellent consistency with low - redshift sne  ia .",
    "most recently , in @xcite we have presented results on the hubble diagram of distant type  ia supernovae from p99 that have been morphologically - typed with hst .",
    "we found no difference in the cosmological results from their morphologically - segregated subsamples .",
    "in particular , e / s0 galaxies  for which one expects the tightest possible correlation between progenitor mass and redshift  not only agree with the cosmological fits using only spiral galaxies , but by themselves confirm the results of p99 .",
    "this is strong evidence that , while age or metallicity could in principle affect the brightnesses of sne  ia , stretch correction eliminates these differences .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while initially suggested to be different between high- and low - redshift sne  ia @xcite , has been demonstrated to agree very well ( within @xmath158 days , * ? ? ? * ) .    on the theoretical side",
    ", the sn formation models of @xcite and @xcite suggest that the progenitor binary system must have in order to produce a sn  ia .",
    "this would impose a lower limit to the metallicities of all sne  ia , and thus limit the extent of any metallicity - induced brightness differences between high- and low - redshift sne  ia . on the empirical side , the lack of a gradient in the intrinsic luminosities of sne  ia with galactocentric distance , coupled with the fact that metallicity gradients are common in spiral galaxies @xcite , lead @xcite to suggest that metallicity is not a key parameter in controlling sne  ia brightnesses at optical wavelengths  though note that @xcite show how it can affect the ultraviolet .",
    "in addition , @xcite find that lightcurve width is not dependent on host - galaxy metallicity .    alternatively ,",
    "population age effects , including pre - explosion cooling undergone by the progenitor white dwarf and other effects linked to the mass of the primary exploding white dwarf have been suggested ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "as the local sample of sne  ia represents populations of all ages and metallicities , both effects can be studied locally .",
    "several low - redshift studies have presented data suggesting that sne  ia intrinsic luminosities ( i.e. , those prior to stretch correction ) may correlate with host - galaxy environment ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these findings are actually encouraging , since unlike stretch itself , there is some hope that host - galaxy environment variations can be translated into physical parameters such as age and metallicity .",
    "these parameters can help relate any drifts in the sne  ia population to evolution of the host galaxies .",
    "more importantly for cosmology , r99 used their sample of 22 local sne  ia to demonstrate that any brightness variations between sne  ia in different host - galaxy environments disappear after correction for lightcurve width .",
    "we have quantified this agreement using a larger local sample of supernovae compiled in @xcite , 14 of which have e / s0 hosts and 27 of which have spiral hosts .",
    "we find that after lightcurve - width correction there can be less than a @xmath159  mag offset between sne  ia in local spirals and ellipticals .",
    "this indicates that lightcurve width is able to correct for age or other differences .",
    "finally , @xcite demonstrate a new method , _ cmagic _ , which is able to standardize the vast majority of local sne  ia to within 0.08  mag ( in contrast to @xmath160  mag which lightcurve - width corrections can attain @xcite ) .",
    "this imposes even more severe limits on the fraction of sne  ia generated by any alternate progenitor scenario , or requires that variations in the progenitor properties have little effect on whether the resulting sn can be standardized .",
    "the data from the new sne  ia presented here do offer one new test for consistency between low- and high - redshift sne  ia .",
    "the quality of our hst data provides measurements of the sn peak magnitudes and lightcurve widths rivaling those for nearby sne  ia .",
    "this allows a direct comparison between the stretch - luminosity relations at low- and high - redshifts .",

    "the low- and high - redshift samples are consistent with the same stretch - luminosity relationship , although it is primarily the low - redshift supernovae that require a non - zero slope for this relationship .",
    "other potential sources of systematic uncertainties have been suggested . @xcite and @xcite argued that the presence of `` grey '' dust , i.e. a homogeneous intergalactic component with weak differential extinction properties over the rest - frame optical wavelength regime could not be ruled out by the p99 data .",
    "since then , measurements of a sn  ia at @xmath161 @xcite were claimed to rule out the `` grey '' dust scenario as a non - cosmological alternative explanation to the dimming of high - redshift supernovae ; however , there remain some outstanding issues with this interpretation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a direct test for extinction over a wide wavelength range , rest - frame b - i , have been performed by @xcite on a single supernova at , , which showed no grey dust signature ; however , see @xcite .",
    "although the situation remains inconclusive , there is no direct evidence that `` grey '' dust is a dominant source of uncertainties .",
    "it remains an important issue to be addressed by future data sets including near - infrared observations .",
    "more recently , the possibility of axion - photon oscillations making high - redshift supernovae appear dimmer was suggested by @xcite .",
    "this attenuation would be wavelength dependent , and thus could be explored with spectroscopic studies of high - shift sources @xcite .",
