    "a galaxy that exhibits bright emission in the nuclear region is termed an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the origin of the radiative energy is putative release of gravitational energy through accretion of the interstellar medium from the host galaxy onto a central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) with a mass of @xmath410@xmath5 .",
    "starbursts are one of the candidates for transporting material onto the center @xcite , so studying the correlation between agns and starbursts is crucial to understanding the origin of agn activity .",
    "seyfert galaxies are the second most numerous agn class in the local universe .",
    "they are classified into two types : type 1 seyfert galaxies show broad and narrow optical emission lines , and type 2 seyfert galaxies show narrow emission lines only .",
    "the difference is explained by the agn unification paradigm @xcite in which molecular gas and dust with a torus - shaped structure ( the so - called dusty torus ) surrounds the central smbh .",
    "the intrinsic agn properties of the two types of seyfert galaxies are assumed to be the identical .",
    "the dusty torus plays various roles in observed spectra : ( 1 ) obscures the agn for a seyfert 2 galaxy and ( 2 ) absorbs the energetic radiation from the agn and re - radiates it as infrared dust emission for both types of seyfert galaxies . because the torus is composed of significant amounts of molecular gas and dust , it is a natural site for star formation . in particular ,",
    "the outer portion of the torus is thought to be an ideal site for star formation because star formation can be suppressed in the inner portion by tidal forces from the smbh . in fact , it was argued that such starburst activity could occur in the dusty torus in the nuclear region ( @xmath6100pc ) of a seyfert galaxy @xcite .",
    "we call such starbursts in seyfert nuclei `` nuclear starbursts '' .",
    "@xcite showed that the nuclear starbursts in the dusty torus can produce an inflated turbulent torus around the central smbh .",
    "however , with limited spatial resolution , it is difficult to detect the emission from the nuclear starbursts as they are diluted by strong agn emission . here",
    ", we discern these emission and estimate the magnitudes of starburst activities using infrared k - band ( 1.92.5@xmath0 m ) and l - band ( 2.84.2@xmath0 m ) spectra .    polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission at around 3.3 @xmath0 m in the l - band is a powerful tool for distinguishing starburst emission from agn emission .",
    "pah molecules are widely distributed throughout interstellar space @xcite .",
    "the pah molecules are not destroyed and are excited by non - ionizing uv photons from stars and then emit the line at 3.3 @xmath0 m in the photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) for starburst @xcite , whereas the pah molecules are destroyed by x - rays @xcite from agn .",
    "observationally , a normal starburst galaxy , which consists of hii regions , pdrs , and molecular gas ( e.g. m82 and ngc253 ) , shows the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission @xcite , whereas a pure agn shows only pah - free continuum emission from larger - sized agn - heated hot dust grains @xcite because an agn emits strong x - rays in addition to uv .",
    "additionally , because the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature is very strong , it is detectable even if the starbursts are weak .",
    "nuclear starbursts in seyfert galaxies can also be investigated through infrared k - band spectra .",
    "the co(@xmath7v=20 ) absorption feature at @xmath1=2.32.4 @xmath0 m is caused by the co molecule in the photosphere of cool stellar population ( i.e. red giants and supergiants ) @xcite .",
    "empirically , starburst galaxies exhibit a substantially deeper co(@xmath7v=20 ) feature than do quiescent spirals galaxies @xcite , and agns do not exhibit this absorption feature .",
    "furthermore dust extinction is much lower in the k- and l - bands than at shorter wavelengths , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively @xcite , so that the quantitative uncertainty of the dust extinction correction is significantly reduced compared with shorter wavelengths ( e.g. uv , optical ) .",
    "thus , k- and l - band spectra enable us to estimate the relative contributions of agn and starbursts emission to an observed spectrum in a quantitatively reliable manner @xcite .",
    "the above authors studied mainly nearby seyfert galaxies with high infrared luminosities ( l@xmath1010@xmath11ergs s@xmath12 ) , and found a correlation between the agn activity and nuclear starburst activity @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the correlation holds over a wide range of agn luminosity .",
    "@xcite argued that the height of the torus is smaller in lower luminosity seyfert galaxies compared with higher luminosity seyfert galaxies , suggesting that nuclear starbursts are weaker in low - luminosity agns . in contrast , @xcite predicted that parsec - scale starbursts would be associated with lower luminosity agns .",
    "@xcite predicted that the ratio of the scatter in the agn to starburst luminosity would increase in low - luminosity agns . to resolve this issue , it is necessary to study seyfert galaxies over a wide agn luminosity range .",
    "thus , we performed k- and l - band spectroscopy of a large sample of seyfert galaxies with luminosity ranging from low to high . throughout the paper , @xmath13 km s@xmath12mpc@xmath12 , @xmath140.3 , @xmath150.7",
    "are adopted .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite studied seyfert galaxies taken from the cfa @xcite and 12 @xmath0 m @xcite samples .",
    "the cfa and 12 @xmath0 m samples were selected through optical spectroscopy of large numbers of galaxies limited by optical and @xmath16 12 @xmath0 m fluxes , respectively .",
    "the cfa sample is usually regarded as a complete sample of optically selected seyfert galaxies .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the cfa sample is likely to be complete only for relatively bright objects .",
    "therefore we added objects from the palomar sample @xcite in this paper .",
    "seyfert galaxies in the palomar sample are selected through optical spectroscopy of nearby , bright ( @xmath1712.5 mag ) , northern ( declination @xmath40@xmath18 ) galaxies covering a wider agn luminosity range .",
    "our aim is to confirm the relationship between agn and nuclear starburst activity over a wide agn luminosity range , paying particular attention to low - luminosity agn . to be easily observable from mauna kea , hawaii ( our observing site ; latitude @xmath1920@xmath18 ) , the declinations of seyfert galaxies were limited to greater than @xmath2030@xmath18 . owing to the telescope limit on the irtf 3.0-m telescope used in this study , a restriction on declination of less than 68@xmath18",
    "was also applied . in total , 13 objects in the palomar sample ( table [ tb : info ] ) were observed .",
    "we also added some additional re - observed seyfert galaxies to our targets .",
    "these galaxies are those studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , in which pah emission was barely discernible , but with less than 3@xmath21 , as reported in these papers ( ngc262 , ngc513 , mrk993 , mcg3 - 58 - 7 , f03450 + 0055 , ngc931 and ngc5548 ) .",
    "moreover , we also included 0152 + 06 in the cfa sample and mcg2 - 8 - 39 in the 12 @xmath0 m sample in our targets .",
    "both of them meet the declination criteria of these paper but were not observed in previous papers . to summarize ,",
    "13 objects from the palomar sample , seven re - observed objects discussed in previous papers , and two new objects from cfa and 12 @xmath0 m samples are included in this paper .",
    "six of the 22 targets are seyfert 1 galaxies and the remaining 16 targets are seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "infrared ( 8 - 1000 @xmath0 m ) luminosity of our targets is log@xmath22=42.544.8 ergs s@xmath12 for the palomar sample and log@xmath22=43.644.8 ergs s@xmath12 for the cfa and 12@xmath0 m samples ( see a caption of table [ tb : info ] for the definition of @xmath22 ) .",
    "detailed information on the targets is summarized in table [ tb : info ] .",
    "we define type 11.5 and type 1.82 seyfert galaxies as seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies , respectively .",
    "mrk993 was classified as a seyfert 2 galaxy in the cfa sample , but later reclassified as a seyfert 1.5 galaxy @xcite .",
    "we adopt the latter classification and thus classified it as a seyfert 1 galaxy , although it was regarded as a seyfert 2 galaxy by @xcite .",
    "table [ tb : observing log ] summarizes our observation log .",
    "all targets were observed with spex @xcite on the irtf 3.0-m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "spex has a 1.94.2@xmath0 m cross - dispersed spectroscopic mode ( lxd1.9 mode ) , enabling us to observe k- and l - band spectra simultaneously . because the seeing in @xmath23 measured with the spex guiding / imaging mode was about 0@xmath2440@xmath248 ( fwhm ) throughout the observations ( except on 26 and 27 march 2009 ) , we consistently used a 0@xmath248-wide slit . on 26 and 27 march 2009 ,",
    "the seeing was over 1@xmath240 at k , so we used a 1@xmath246-wide slit during those observations . a standard telescope nodding technique ( abba pattern ) with a throw of 7@xmath245 was employed along the slit to subtract background emission .",
    "the physical scale probed by our slit spectroscopy is 24500 pc taking into account the redshift , z = 0.0020.032 , and slit width .",
    "we observed a- , f- and g - type main - sequence stars ( table [ tb : observing log ] ) as standard stars .",
    "these were used to correct for transmission through the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we observed the standard stars at airmasses similar to the targets ( @xmath60.1 difference ) , before and after the observation of each target to better correct for possible time variations in the earth atmosphere .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf tasks .",
    "frames taken with an a ( b ) beam were subtracted from frames taken with a b ( a ) beam , and then median images were taken and divided by a spectroscopic flat image . known bad pixels and remaining pixels hit by cosmic rays",
    "were replaced with interpolated values from the surrounding pixels .",
    "the seyfert galaxies and standard - star spectra were then extracted by integrating signals over 1@xmath2432@xmath245 along the slit .",
    "the one - dimensional spectrum was extracted by fitting the signals in each spectral order in the two - dimensional image .",
    "we used the wavelength - dependent nature of transmission through the earth s atmosphere for our wavelength calibration .",
    "the object spectra were divided by spectra of standard stars to remove the effects of atmospheric absorption and then multiplied by the spectra of blackbodies with temperatures corresponding to those of the individual standard stars ( table [ tb : observing log ] ) .",
    "flux calibration was performed based on the signal detected inside our slit , taking into account the differences in exposure time between our targets and the standard stars .",
    "k- and l - band magnitudes for the standard stars were estimated from their v - band magnitudes , adopting appropriate @xmath25 and @xmath2 colors for each individual standard star stellar type @xcite .",
    "a strong methane absorption line appears @xmath1 = 3.315@xmath0 m in the earth s atmosphere . although this could be corrected by standard stars in theory , it introduces a relatively strong amount of noise .",
    "thus , we excluded a few data points at around @xmath1 = 3.315 @xmath0 m , whose transmission were less than 40% of nearby signals without being affected by the absorption line .",
    "figure [ fig : l - band_spectra ] shows flux - calibrated 3.03.6 @xmath0 m slit spectra in the l - band . although the full l - band ( 2.84.2 @xmath0 m ) wavelength range is covered by spex , both ends of the l - band are noisy because of poor transmission through the earth s atmosphere ( @xmath26 m ) and high background emission from the earth s atmosphere ( @xmath27 m ) .",
    "we removed those data points for the discussions in this paper because they were not necessary for our scientific aims . in these plots ,",
    "some objects show a clear excess at 3.29 @xmath0m@xmath28(1+z ) whose wavelength corresponds to the redshifted 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature .",
    "we regard the features as detected when at least two consecutive data points at around 3.29 @xmath0m@xmath28(1+z ) are higher than 1.5 times the scatter of the continuum level . using this criterion ,",
    "objects with detectable pah emission are marked with `` 3.3 @xmath0 m pah '' , and pah non - detected objects are marked with `` 3.3 @xmath0 m pah ( ? ) '' in the figure .",
    "we fitted the emission line to a gaussian function by setting the normalization , full width of half maximum ( fwhm ) and central wavelength of the emission as free parameters , and then estimated the flux ( @xmath29 ) , luminosity ( @xmath3 ) and rest - frame equivalent width ( @xmath30 ) of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission . for objects with no clear pah emission features , we estimated upper limits by fitting the emission line with a gaussian function whose height , central wavelength and fwhm were fixed as 3 @xmath21 , where 1 @xmath21 was a dispersion of its continuum emission , 3.29@xmath28(1+z)@xmath0 m and 0.02@xmath28(1+z)@xmath0 m @xcite , respectively .",
    "the strengths of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission features are summarized in table [ tb : results ] .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature is detected in @xmath19 23% ( 5/22 ) of the observed seyfert galaxies ( ngc6764 , 5194 , 5273 , f03450 + 0055 and mcg-3 - 58 - 7 ) .",
    "ngc6764 shows a strong pah emission feature , and its rest - frame equivalent width ( @xmath30 ) is as high as those of starburst galaxies ( @xmath19100 nm ; @xcite ) .",
    "although four objects ( ngc5194 , ngc5273 , f03450 + 0055 and mcg-3 - 58 - 7 ) show detectable 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission , the @xmath30 values are significantly smaller than @xmath19100 nm .",
    "the other 17 objects do not display detectable pah features .",
    "flux - calibrated 2.02.5 @xmath0 m slit spectra in the k - band are shown in figure [ fig : k - band_spectra ] .",
    "most of the spectra show a flux depression at @xmath31 m in the observed frame , which is attributed to the co ( @xmath7v=20 ) molecular absorption feature .",
    "the strength of the co absorption feature was quantified by a spectroscopic @xmath32 index defined by @xcite as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an average of actual signal at @xmath1 = 2.312.40 @xmath0 m divided by a power - law continuum ( @xmath35 ) extrapolated from shorter wavelengths . as some strong emission features appear at around 2@xmath0 m in k - band , such as h@xmath36 10 s(1 ) ( @xmath37 m ) , br@xmath38 ( @xmath39 m ) and h@xmath36 10 s(0 ) ( @xmath40 m ) , we used data points at @xmath41 m to fit the continuum level after excluding these emission lines .",
    "the continuum level is shown as a solid line in figure [ fig : k - band_spectra ] .",
    "the @xmath32 of all our targets are given in table [ tb : results ] .",
    "the @xmath32 values of cool stars are typically 0.20.3 @xcite . for objects with a clear co absorption feature ( @xmath42 0.02 ) ,",
    "`` co absorption '' signature is written in figure [ fig : k - band_spectra ] .",
    "about 77 % ( 17/22 ) of observed seyfert galaxies show clear co absorption features .",
    "figure [ fig : cohist_lirgs ] is a histogram of the @xmath32 of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs : their luminosities are generally explained by starbursts ) measured by @xcite .",
    "it suggests that their typical value is also @xmath19 0.20.3 .",
    "if the properties of nuclear starbursts in seyfert galaxies are similar to those of starbursts in lirgs , the @xmath32 of the starbursts in seyfert galaxies is also expected to be 0.20.3",
    ". however , the observed @xmath32 is smaller than the typical value for a lirg because featureless agn emission is superposed in the k - band spectrum .",
    "because we took k- and l - band spectra simultaneously , possible slit loss caused by irtf / spex tracking error is similar and sky conditions are the same for the k- and l - bands .",
    "therefore , the derived @xmath2 colors are very reliable .",
    "the emission from normal stars ( @xmath42000k ) in the l - band is much weaker than in the k - band , whereas hot ( @xmath191000k ) dust heated by an agn emits strongly in both the k- and l - bands .",
    "thus the @xmath2 colors become smaller ( bluer ) with increasing relative contribution from stellar emission to the total emission of nuclear region . indeed , intrinsic @xmath2 colors of seyfert 1 galaxies are typically 12 mag @xcite was used in @xcite ; we assumed the differ ence between k@xmath43 and k was negligible . ] , and those of normal spiral galaxies are @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the color enables us to distinguish starburst - important seyfert galaxies from agn - dominant ones .",
    "the nuclear @xmath2 colors derived from our slit spectra are summarized in column ( 6 ) of table [ tb : results ] .    for the combined sample used in this paper , taken from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we compared the @xmath2 colors of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies ( figure [ fig : k - lhist ] ) .",
    "most of the seyfert 1 galaxies are distributed in the @xmath45 12 mag range , whereas the colors of almost half of seyfert 2 galaxies are bluer than the seyfert 1 galaxies ( @xmath46 mag ) .",
    "it shows that stellar contamination is relatively larger in seyfert 2s than seyfert 1s in the observed total emission .",
    "two possibilities could explain the result .",
    "first , agn emission is strongly affected by the extinction of dusty torus compared with nuclear starburst emission . in the agn unified model , as the agn emission comes from the central region , the emission from a seyfert 2 galaxy passes through the dusty torus and is more strongly absorbed by the dusty torus than those from a seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "so , observed agn emission of seyfert 2 galaxies would be relatively weak in comparison to seyfert 1 galaxies . whereas , if the nuclear starbursts are occurring in the outer region of the dusty torus , then the absorption effect would not be much difference between these types of seyfert galaxies . in this case , the starburst contribution to the total emission would be relatively significant in seyfert 2s when compared with seyfert 1s and then the @xmath2 colors of seyfert 2s would be bluer than those of seyfert 1s .",
    "another possible explanation is the starbursts in the central region in seyfert 2 galaxies could be more active than those in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "if strong nuclear starbursts inflate the dusty torus more thickly than weaker starbursts , then a seyfert galaxy with active starbursts is much more likely to be observed as type 2 , and the color of it would be bluer than one with weak starbursts .",
    "however , as we will discuss in  [ sec : iras 12 and 25 um luminosity ] , we find no clear difference between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies in quantitatively measured 3.3 @xmath0 m pah luminosity .",
    "so , it is unlikely that the difference of the @xmath2 colors between seyfert 1s and 2s is caused by the intrinsic difference of starburst activities in them",
    ". therefore we suggest that the bluer @xmath2 colors of seyfert 2s than seyfert 1s are due to the obscuration of agn emission and to relative contamination of the stellar emission in seyfert 2 galaxies . @xcite and @xcite deconvolved surface brightness profile of seyfert 1s and 2s within 3-arcsec aperture into a combination of a nuclear source ( non - stellar component ) , a bulge component and a disk component , and suggested that the stellar contamination to the total emission is larger in seyfert 2s than in seyfert 1s",
    ".    figures [ fig : kl - pahco]a and [ fig : kl - pahco]b show the @xmath2 color versus the @xmath30 and @xmath32 of the sample .",
    "these figures show that both the @xmath30 and @xmath32 decrease with reddening @xmath2 color .",
    "thus they are useful tracers for estimating the starburst contribution to the nuclear spectra inside our slit .",
    "the trends of seyfert 2 galaxies in figure [ fig : kl - pahco ] are similar to those for seyfert 1 galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : kl - pahco]b , however , some fraction of seyfert 2 galaxies in our sample reach to @xmath32 = 0.20.3 , which is closer to those of lirgs , in comparison to seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "this is good agreement with the suggestion above . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath32 of some fraction of seyfert 2 galaxies are not strongly diluted by agn emission .",
    "we compare the nuclear starburst activity with agn activity over a wide agn luminosity range .",
    "the nuclear starburst activity is reasonably quantifiable from the observed 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission luminosity inside our slit spectrum .",
    "meanwhile @xcite showed that the obscuring effects of the agn emission for seyfert galaxies became insignificant at longer than 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "@xmath16 60 and 100 @xmath0 m luminosities contain more contamination of emission from star formation in the host galaxy than do @xmath16 12 and 25 @xmath0 m luminosities @xcite , so we use @xmath16 12 and 25 @xmath0 m luminos ities as good tracers of agn power in seyfert galaxies .",
    "a comparison between the @xmath16 12 and 25 @xmath0 m luminosities and the observed nuclear 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission luminosity is shown in figures [ fig : agnpowervspahlumin]a and [ fig : agnpowervspahlumin]b , respectively . in these figures",
    ", we combined with the data of four sources observed by @xcite using the 0@xmath248 slit width of irtf / spex .",
    "we see no clear difference in the @xmath3 between the two types of seyfert galaxies when normalized to the agn power .",
    "this means that we see no evidence of the possibility that seyfert 2 galaxies tend to show intrinsically stronger starburst activities than do seyfert 1 galaxies , a possibility discussed in ",
    "[ sec:@xmath2 color ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : agnpowervspahlumin ] , the nuclear 3.3 @xmath0 m pah luminosities for our objects combined with previous data are @xmath4710@xmath48 ergs s@xmath12 . in starburst - dominated galaxies , the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah - to - far - infrared ( 40500 @xmath0 m ) luminosity ratios ( @xmath49 ) are @xmath50 @xcite . the nuclear star - formation rates ( sfr )",
    "are calculated by sfr m@xmath51 yr@xmath12 = ( @xmath52 ergs s@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "so the sfr of our sample could be up to 4.5450@xmath53 yr@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite showed that a supernova rate ( snr ) of 5.4 to 540 @xmath28 10@xmath54 yr@xmath12 , corresponding to 7.7770@xmath2810@xmath55 yr@xmath12 ( snr @xmath56 0.007 sfr ) , can produce torus heights of as large as 10 pc at the outer side @xmath56 5 pc .",
    "hence , the star - formation rate of almost our entire sample could be high enough to create a geometrically thick dusty torus .",
    "we should note , however , that we have only upper limits on the nuclear 3.3 @xmath0 m pah luminosities for many objects in our sample , so it is likely that the sample contains seyfert galaxies that do not have a thick dusty torus .",
    "the figures show that the nuclear starburst luminosity decreases with decreasing agn power and that the trend dose not change over a wide agn luminosity range .",
    "the ratios of starburst activity to agn activities for both seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies show the same levels of scatter and we find no obvious difference between them .",
    "we apply the generalized kendall rank correlation statistics provided in the astronomy survival analysis package ( asurv : @xcite ) ( which handles data with upper limits ) to figures [ fig : agnpowervspahlumin]a and [ fig : agnpowervspahlumin]b .",
    "the probabilities that a correlation is not present for the figures are both found to be @xmath190.00% .",
    "the results show that there are tight correlation between 3.3 @xmath0 m pah luminosity in central region and @xmath16 12 and 25 @xmath0 m luminosities .",
    "although the contamination from star formation activity in @xmath16 12 and 25 @xmath0 m is less than in the @xmath16 60 and 100 @xmath0 m , it could be that the @xmath16 12 and 25 @xmath0 m data still contain a significant amount of emission from star - forming activity of host galaxies in our low luminosity agn sample , given the large aperture of @xmath16 12 @xmath0 m ( @xmath57 ) and 25 @xmath0 m ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "@xcite compared small aperture unresolved nuclear 10 @xmath0 m emission ( 0@xmath2440@xmath245 ) and 20 @xmath0 m emission ( 0@xmath2450@xmath246 ) with the @xmath16 12 @xmath0 m and 25 @xmath0 m emission , respectively , and found the large aperture data are largely contaminated by starlight .",
    "so it is likely that the @xmath16 12 @xmath0 m and 25 @xmath0 m emission is significantly contaminated by star formation in host galaxies . to reduce the possible ambiguity",
    ", we should compare the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission with an agn indicator measured with a smaller aperture .",
    "the n - band ( @xmath59=10.78@xmath0 m , @xmath60=5.7@xmath0 m ) is observable from the ground , and its luminosity is also thought to be a good tracer of agn power @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented n - band photometric data for the central regions of seyfert galaxies .",
    "they used the palomar 5-m telescope with a 1@xmath245 aperture .",
    "only 41% ( 9/22 ) of our objects were measured by @xcite .",
    "we combine these with data from @xcite , which is shown in figure [ fig : n - band_agnpowervspahlumin ] . although the number of low - luminosity agns is small and their 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission luminosities are only upper limits , the three low luminosity seyfert galaxies are distributed around a line extrapolated from the stronger agn activity region .",
    "we also apply the generalized kendall rank correlation statistics to figure [ fig : n - band_agnpowervspahlumin ] .",
    "the uncorrelated probability is @xmath190.03% for the figure .",
    "these results mean that the correlation between the luminosities of the nuclear starbursts detected inside the slit spectra and central agns is statistically confirmed in seyfert galaxies for all observed quantities .",
    "we found the relation between the luminosities of 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission within our slit width and of n - band .",
    "however it is worried that the @xmath3 is affected by physical aperture size probed by the slits .",
    "it means that we are concerned about the possibility that the @xmath3 of the most luminous object is due to the largest area we observed .",
    "if star formation traced by @xmath3 is spatially extending in a wide area of host galaxy , then the @xmath3 becomes higher with lager physical scale . to explore this",
    ", we compare the @xmath3 with physical area of each source ( figure [ fig : surfacevsl3.3 ] ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows that not all high @xmath3 objects are wide physical area coverage .",
    "that is to say , the star formation would be occurring in the central region inside the slits and not spatially extend .",
    "we find no evidence that the ratio of starbursts to agn luminosity deviates upward in low - luminosity agns , as predicted by @xcite , or that nuclear starburst activities increase with decreasing agn activities as predicted by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we find no clear change in the correlations over a wide agn luminosity range .",
    "this is explained if the main mechanism that connects the agn and nuclear starbursts is the same at each luminosity range . a model shown in wada & norman ( 2002",
    "; see also @xcite ) , which predicts the enhancement of a mass accretion rate onto a central smbh owing to increased turbulence of molecular gas in the torus caused by nuclear starbursts , is one possible scenario that could account for the luminosity correlation .",
    "we calculated stellar luminosity ( @xmath61 ) from @xmath32 .",
    "if nuclear starbursts with properties similar to star - formation - dominated lirgs appear inside our slit and the entire k - band emission comes from stars , then the detected @xmath32 must be 0.20.3 .",
    "we assumed the original @xmath32 of the cool star was 0.25 .",
    "when the contributions of stellar emission to total emission are 100% , the average signal at @xmath1 = 2.312.4@xmath62 m is reduced by about 20.5% compared with an extrapolation from a shorter wavelength .",
    "when the contribution of agn emission to the total emission is 100 % , the absorption feature does not appear .",
    "when the contributions of both stellar and agn emission are equal , the average signal at @xmath1 = 2.312.4@xmath62 m should be 10.25% reduced from the shorter wavelength , and the @xmath32 should be 0.117 . in the case",
    "that the @xmath32 is 0.1 or 0.15 , the contributions of stellar emission to total emission should be 43% or 63% , respectively .",
    "so , we can estimate the @xmath61 .",
    "figure [ fig : lkstellarvspahlumin ] compares the @xmath61 and the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission luminosity in the nuclear region detected inside our slit spectra combined with fig .",
    "5 of @xcite .",
    "although they plotted these results for seyfert 2 galaxies only , we included in figure [ fig : lkstellarvspahlumin ] seyfert 1 galaxies whose @xmath32 were derived in @xcite .",
    "the k - band to infrared luminosity ratios of starburst - dominated lirgs were estimated to be @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "if the nuclear starbursts in seyfert galaxies have properties similar to the starburst - dominated lirgs , then the same relation should hold .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah to infrared luminosity ratios in starbursts were found to be @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath65 for starbursts , the luminosity of the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission to the k - band stellar luminosity ratios are expected to be @xmath66 , if both luminosities trace the same starbursts .",
    "the value is shown as a solid line in figure [ fig : lkstellarvspahlumin ] .",
    "most of our seyfert 1 galaxies and about half of the seyfert 2 galaxies plotted in the figure are distributed around the line . however , the remaining half of the seyfert 2 galaxies are distributed under the line . given that in figure [ fig : agnpowervspahlumin ] , the @xmath3 distribution of both seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies is similar within their dispersions and no obvious difference is seen between them , the discrepancy must be caused by @xmath61 . as we discussed above , the @xmath61",
    "is estimated from the @xmath32 value , which is related to the fraction of stellar to agn emission .",
    "nuclear starbursts are expected to occur at the outer part of the dusty torus and the agn radiation of type 2 seyfert galaxy is significantly attenuated by the dusty torus .",
    "therefore , the @xmath32 is likely to increase and thus increase @xmath61 in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "in contrast , because @xmath3 is estimated from the flux of 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission , pah - estimated starburst luminosity is not affected by the absorption of agn emission . in summary , we suggest that because @xmath61 represents a relative value of stellar to agn emission and @xmath3 represents an absolute value of stellar emission , it is possible that @xmath61 is overluminous and that the ratio of @xmath67 decreases in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the other possibility is that the signatures of stellar emission detected in the k - band spectra are significantly contaminated by old bulge stars in the nuclear part of the host galaxy , whereas the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission originates in spatially unresolved ( smaller than subarcsecond ) nuclear starbursts in the dusty torus because old stars do not have enough pah - exciting uv photons . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the emission of old stars in the host galaxy mainly produces the k - band spectra .",
    "however , most of the seyfert 1 and some fraction of the seyfert 2 galaxies have @xmath67 ratios similar to the value expected when the origin of both luminosities is the same . therefore , although the old stars in host galaxy may contribute to the observed k - band spectra of some fraction of seyfert galaxies , it is not likely that old stars dominate the k - band spectra in all objects .",
    "the results of an infrared k- and l - band spectroscopic study of 13 seyfert galaxies from the palomar sample , and seven seyfert galaxies with non - detectable 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission discussed in previous papers and two new seyfert galaxies from cfa and 12@xmath0 m samples are presented .",
    "our l - band spectroscopic method successfully detected the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission in @xmath19 23 % ( = 5/22 ) of the observed seyfert galaxies .",
    "also , our k - band spectroscopic method showed @xmath19 77 % ( = 17/22 ) of seyfert nuclei in our sample have clear co absorption feature .",
    "we examined the relationship between agn activity and nuclear starburst activity over a wide agn luminosity range using our spectra together on previously published spectra @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the @xmath2 colors of seyfert 2 galaxies are widely distributed toward the blue , compared with those of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "this implies either that the dusty torus absorbs the agn emission of seyfert 2 galaxies from the central region or that seyfert 2 galaxies tend to have stronger nuclear starbursts than do seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "as the @xmath3 of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies do not differ significantly , we have interpreted this as the result of the effect that the agn emission of seyfert 2s is absorbed by dust of torus and then the stellar emission becomes relatively larger .",
    "the @xmath3 shows the same range in seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies .",
    "the star - formation rates of our sample are up to 4.5450 @xmath53 yr@xmath12 , which could be enough to swell the dusty torus by supernova explosion ; in short , it is geometrically thick , although many objects we provided are only with upper limits on the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah luminosities .",
    "the @xmath3 correlates with mid - infrared ( n - band ) luminosity with small aperture (= tracing agn activities ) , and their luminosity ratio does not vary significantly over a wide agn luminosity range .",
    "moreover the @xmath3 is independent of physical scale we probed with slits .",
    "therefore the @xmath3 ( i.e. star formation ) would concentrate on the central region , and the nuclear star formation would induce the accretion onto the smbh and encourage the agn activity . in this work ,",
    "we find no evidence that nuclear starbursts are stronger in lower - luminosity agn .",
    "we suggest that the 3.3 @xmath0 m pah emission luminosity and k - band stellar luminosity ( @xmath61 ) originate in the same phenomenon .",
    "however , for some fraction of seyfert 2 galaxies , @xmath61 is likely to be overestimated because of flux attenuation of agn emission caused by a dusty torus and contaminated by old stars in the spheroid of the host galaxy .",
