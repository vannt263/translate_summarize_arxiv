    "in superstring theory @xcite , it is well known that there are various flat directions parameterized by scalar fields .",
    "( hereafter , we call these fields as `` moduli '' fields . ) since their potential is usually generated by effects of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , their masses are expected to be of the order of the gravitino mass .",
    "although masses of the moduli fields can be as light as ( or even lighter than ) the electroweak scale , moduli fields do not affect collider experiments since their interactions are suppressed by inverse powers of the gravitational scale .",
    "cosmologically , however , they may cause serious problems @xcite .",
    "if the mass of the moduli fields @xmath1 , reheating temperature of the universe becomes lower than @xmath2 .",
    "with such a low reheating temperature , the success of the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is spoiled . for lighter moduli fields ( @xmath3 ) , they survive until today and overclose the universe .",
    "one solution to these difficulties is to push up the mass of the moduli fields @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that the scenario with heavy moduli can naturally fit into the framework of the anomaly - mediated susy breaking @xcite .",
    "indeed the reheating temperature can be higher than @xmath2 if @xmath4 . in this case",
    ", the bbn occurs after the decay of the modulus field .",
    "although the thermal history after the bbn is mostly the same as the standard one , cosmology before the modulus decay is completely different .",
    "importantly , fluctuations of moduli fields affect the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . in this talk",
    ", we consider this scenario and study its consequence in the cmb .",
    "now we discuss the cmb angular power spectrum from the scenario with the cosmological modulus field @xcite .",
    "first , we emphasize that there are two independent sources of the cmb anisotropy , i.e. , primordial metric perturbation @xmath5 induced by inflaton field fluctuation and amplitude fluctuation of the modulus field @xmath6 which is of order @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "therefore , the resultant cmb angular power spectrum @xmath9 is given in the following form : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is from the perturbation in the inflaton field , which is of order @xmath12 . on the contrary , @xmath13 is from the primordial fluctuation of the modulus amplitude , which is of order @xmath14 .",
    "( notice that there is no term which is of order @xmath15 since two fluctuations are uncorrelated . )",
    "@xmath11 can be calculated by following the standard method . in calculating @xmath13",
    ", we must specify the origin of cdm and baryon . here",
    ", we assume that cdm is generated by the decay of @xmath0 . in this case , after the decay of the modulus field , there is no entropy between cdm and radiation . on the contrary , we consider two possibilities of generating baryon asymmetry : ( i ) the baryon asymmetry is ( somehow ) generated at the time of ( or after ) the decay of @xmath0 , or ( ii ) the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism @xcite generates the baryon number .",
    "let us first consider the case ( i ) . in this case",
    ", there is no entropy between baryon and radiation , so the cosmic fluctuations are same as the conventional adiabatic case once the modulus field decays .",
    "thus , if we neglect the scale dependences of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", the cmb angular power spectrum is the same as the usual adiabatic case if the normalization of the initial fluctuations are properly chosen .",
    "however , this fact has significant implications when we construct a model of inflation .",
    "first of all , since curvature perturbation induced by the modulus field @xmath16 is of order @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the initial amplitude of @xmath0 , large cosmic perturbation can be generated by lowering @xmath19 even if @xmath8 is small .",
    "furthermore , usually , scale dependence of @xmath6 is milder than that of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , when @xmath20 is realized , the resultant cmb angular power spectrum may be like that from the scale - invariant adiabatic perturbation even if @xmath5 has a strong scale dependence .",
    "these facts relax constraints on the potential of the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "next we consider the case ( ii ) . here",
    "we assume that the initial value of the fluctuation in the ad field is negligibly small . during the inflation .",
    "]     for the case with the correlated isocurvature perturbation in the baryonic sector ( dashed line ) , as well as @xmath9 for purely adiabatic ( solid line ) and purely baryonic isocurvature ( dotted line ) cases .",
    "we used the normalization @xmath21_{l=10}=1 $ ] .",
    "_ right _ : the cmb angular power spectrum @xmath9 for @xmath22 ( solid ) , @xmath23 ( dashed ) , and @xmath24 ( dotted ) where @xmath25 .",
    "the overall normalization of @xmath9 is determined to be best fitted to the the observational data @xcite .",
    "in these figures , the cosmological parameters are taken such that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and scale - invariance is assumed both for @xmath5 and @xmath29.,title=\"fig : \" ] for the case with the correlated isocurvature perturbation in the baryonic sector ( dashed line ) , as well as @xmath9 for purely adiabatic ( solid line ) and purely baryonic isocurvature ( dotted line ) cases .",

    "the cosmological parameters are taken such that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and scale - invariance is assumed both for @xmath5 and @xmath29.,title=\"fig : \" ]    even when there is no primordial fluctuation in the ad field , however , non - vanishing isocurvature fluctuation is generated in the baryonic sector if @xmath30 . since",
    ", initially , there is no fluctuation in the baryon energy density , the entropy between baryon and @xmath0 exists ; @xmath31 where @xmath32 this entropy is conserved until the modulus field decays , and it becomes the entropy between photon and baryon after the decay of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , in calculating @xmath13 which is generated by the primordial fluctuation in the modulus amplitude , initial condition for the baryonic density fluctuation is different from the conventional adiabatic one , and is given by , in deep radiation dominated epoch @xcite , @xmath33 importantly , the curvature perturbation @xmath16 is induced by the initial entropy perturbation @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , notice that the first term in the right - handed side of the above equation does not exist in the usual adiabatic ones .",
    "initial conditions for other perturbations are the same as the usual adiabatic case . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ db_i ] ) gives rise to the non - vanishing entropy in the baryonic sector and hence we call it as the `` isocurvature '' term .",
    "here , it should be emphasized that such an isocurvature fluctuation is _ correlated _ with the contribution from @xmath16 which gives rise to the effect like the conventional adiabatic fluctuation .",
    "thus , the effect of this `` isocurvature '' fluctuation is completely different from the conventional _ uncorrelated _ isocurvature fluctuation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] , we show the total cmb angular power spectrum with such a correlated isocurvature fluctuation in the baryonic density fluctuation .",
    "since there are two sources of the cosmic perturbations , @xmath5 and @xmath34 ( or equivalently , @xmath6 ) , we define @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gravitational potential in the adiabatic mode at the radiation dominated epoch after the modulus decay .",
    "( for simplicity , we neglect the scale dependence of @xmath37 . ) treating @xmath37 as a free parameter , we plot the total @xmath9 for several values of @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] .",
    "as one can see , correlated isocurvature perturbation in the baryonic sector may result in an enhancement of @xmath9 at higher multipoles relative to that at lower ones .",
    "therefore , on - going and future experiments will give us interesting tests of the scenario with the cosmological moduli fields .",
    "we have studied the effects of the cosmological moduli fields on the cmb anisotropy . in the scenario with the cosmological moduli fields , _ correlated",
    "_ isocurvature fluctuation may exist in the baryonic sector which results in enhanced cmb angular power spectrum at higher multipoles relative to that at lower ones .",
    "in addition , even in the case where there is no isocurvature perturbation , the cosmological modulus field may have important implication to the model - building of the inflation ."
