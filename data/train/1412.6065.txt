    "the fighter uses this leeway to build a sequence of logarithmic spiral segments of increasing excentricities @xmath24 that stay away from the fire , plus one final line segment that closes this barrier curve onto itself .",
    "logarithmic spiral movements have also been used for shortest paths amidst growing circles  @xcite and in the context of search games  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the rather natural approach where the fire fighter keeps building a barrier right along the boundary of the expanding fire , at constant speed @xmath1 .",

    "while the fighter keeps building @xmath2 , the fire is coming after her along the outside of the barrier , as shown in figure  [ fire - fig ] .",
    "intuitively , the fighter can only win this race , and contain the fire , if the last coil of the barrier hits the previous coil .",
    ", having constructed a barrier from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , the fire has expanded along the outer side of the barrier up to point @xmath28 . ]",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the length , @xmath29 , of the tangent from the fighter s current position @xmath16 back to point @xmath13 becomes zero .",
    "first , we deduce two structural properties of barrier curve @xmath2 .",
    "they lead to a recursive system of linear differential equations that allow us to describe the values of @xmath29 in the @xmath30-th round .",
    "it turns out that we need only check the signs of the values @xmath31 at the end of round  @xmath30 , in order to see if the fighter is successful .",

    "singularities can only arise from zeroes of the denominator that do not cancel out with the numerator .",

    "a theorem of pringsheim s directly implies that not all coefficients @xmath31 of power series @xmath36 can be positive , showing that barrier curve @xmath2 does close on itself at some time .    to find out after how many rounds this happens we look at the conjugate pair of zeroes of smallest modulus and let @xmath37 denote their ( positive ) argument .",
    "residue analysis shows that @xmath38 rounds are necessary before the fire is contained .",
    "as speed @xmath1 decreases towards @xmath9 , the two conjugate zeroes merge into a real zero .",
    "therefore , argument @xmath37 tends to  0 , proving that the fire fighter can not succeed at speed @xmath10 .",
    "in addition to the results on curve @xmath2 , we obtain the following lower bound .",
    "let us call a curve `` spiralling '' if it visits the four coordinate half - axes in cyclic order , and at increasing distances from the origin .",
    "( note that curve @xmath2 is spiralling even though the fighter s distance to  the origin may be decreasing : the barrier s intersection points with any ray from  @xmath39 are of increasing order since the curve does not self - intersect . )",
    "we prove that a fire fighter who follows such a spiralling curve can only be successful if her speed exceeds @xmath40 , the golden ratio .",
    "a preliminary version of part of this paper has appeared at socg15  @xcite .",
    "we thank all anonymous referees for their valuable suggestions and , in particular , for pointing out to us the work by bressan et al .  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath41 be a point on the barrier curve s first round , as depicted in figure  [ spirals - fig ] .",
    "if @xmath15 denotes the angle between the fighter s velocity vector at @xmath41 and the ray from  0 through @xmath41 , the fighter moves at speed @xmath42 away from  0 .",
    "this implies @xmath43 , because the fire expands at unit speed and the fighter stays on its frontier , by definition .",
    "since the fighter is operating at constant speed @xmath1 , angle @xmath15 is constant , and given by @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , the first part of the barrier curve , between points @xmath26 and @xmath44 shown in figure  [ spirals - fig ] , ( i ) , is part of a logarithmic spiral of excentricity @xmath15 centered at  0 .    , centered at 0 and @xmath26 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ] , centered at 0 and @xmath26 , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in polar coordinates , this segment can be desribed by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] , and @xmath47 denotes the distance from the origin to @xmath26 , i.e. , the fire s intitial radius .    in general ,",
    "the curve length of a logarithmic spiral of excentricity @xmath15 between two points at distance @xmath48 to its center is known to be @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we have for the length @xmath50 of the barrier curve from @xmath26 to @xmath44 the equation @xmath51 from point @xmath44 on , the geodesic shortest path , along which the fire spreads from 0 to the fighter s current position , @xmath41 , is no longer straight .",
    "it starts with segment @xmath52 , followed by segment @xmath53 , until , for @xmath54 , segment @xmath55 becomes tangent to the barrier curve at @xmath26 ; see figure  [ spirals - fig ] , ( ii ) . by the same arguments as above , between @xmath44 and @xmath27 barrier curve @xmath2",

    "consequently , the overall curve length @xmath59 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 equals @xmath60     on the barrier curve results from wrapping around the barrier already constructed . the last segment , _",

    ". the fighter will be successful if , and only if , @xmath29 ever shrinks to zero . ]    from point @xmath27 on , the geodesic shortest path from  0 to the fighter s current position , @xmath41 , starts wrapping around the existing spiral part of the curve , beginning at @xmath26 ; see  figure  [ string - fig ] .",
    "the last segment of this path is tangent to the previous round of the curve . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", we shall endeavor to determine its length , @xmath29 , because the fire will be contained if and only if @xmath29 ever attains the value  0 .",
    "one could think of this tangent as a string ( named the _",
    "free string _ ) at whose endpoint ,  @xmath41 , a pencil is attached that draws the barrier curve .",
    "but unlike an involute , here the string is not normal to the outer layer .",
    "rather , its extension beyond @xmath41 forms an angle  @xmath15 with the barrier s tangent at @xmath41 .",
    "this causes the string to grow in length by @xmath61 for each unit drawn . at the same time , the inner part of the string gets wrapped around the previous coil of the barrier .",
    "it is this interplay between growing and wrapping we need to analyze .",
    "one can show that after @xmath27 no segment of positive length of @xmath2 is part of a logarithmic spiral .",
    "in this subsection we assume that the fighter has built quite a few rounds of the barrier curve without yet containing the fire . that the first two rounds of the curve involve two different spiral segments , around @xmath39 and around @xmath26 , influences the subsequent layers .",
    "the structure of the curve can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath59 denote the curve lengths from @xmath26 to @xmath44 and @xmath27 , respectively , as in equations  [ l1-eq ] and  [ l2-eq ] .",
    "for @xmath62 $ ] let @xmath63 denote the segment connecting @xmath39 to the point of curve length @xmath64 ; see the sketch given in figure  [ linkage - fig ] .    .",
    "this way , two types of linkages are defined . ]    at the endpoint of @xmath63 we construct the tangent and extend it until it hits the next layer of the curve , creating a segment @xmath65 , and so on . this construction gives rise to a `` linkage '' connecting adjacent layers of the curve .",
    "each edge of the linkage is turned counterclockwise by @xmath15 with respect to its predecessor .",
    "the outermost edge of a linkage is the free string mentioned above .",
    "as parameter @xmath64 increases from  @xmath39 to @xmath50 , edge @xmath63 , and the whole linkage , rotate counterclockwise .",
    "while @xmath66 equals the line segment from the origin to @xmath26 , edge @xmath67 equals segment @xmath68 .",
    "analogously , let @xmath69 $ ] , and let @xmath70 denote the segment from @xmath26 to the point at curve length @xmath71 from @xmath26 .",
    "this segment can be extended into a linkage in the same way .",
    "we observe that @xmath72 hold ( but initially , we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 , so that @xmath75 ) .",
    "clearly , each point on the curve can be reached by a unique linkage , as tangents can be constructed backwards .",
    "we refer to the two types of linkages by @xmath29-type and @xmath7-type . as figure  [ linkage - fig ] illustrates , points of the same linkage type form alternating intervals along the barrier curve .",
    "if @xmath41 s linkage is of @xmath29-type then @xmath41 is uniquely determined by the index @xmath76 and parameter @xmath62 $ ] such that @xmath41 is the outer endpoint of edge @xmath77 .",
    "now we will derive two structural properties of @xmath29-linkages on which our analysis will be based ; analogous facts hold for @xmath7-linkages , too . to this end , let @xmath78 denote the length of the barrier curve from @xmath26 to the outer endpoint of edge @xmath77 , and let @xmath77 also denote the length of edge @xmath77 .",
    "[ grow - lem ] we have @xmath79 .",
    "both , fire and fire fighter , reach the endpoint of @xmath77 at the same time .",
    "the fire has travelled a geodesic distance of @xmath80 at unit speed , the fighter a distance of @xmath78 at speed @xmath81 .",
    "the second property is related to the wrapping of the free string .",
    "intuitively , it says that if we turn an @xmath29-linkage , the speed of each edge s endpoint is proportional to its length .",
    "[ links - lem ] as functions in @xmath64 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 satisfy the following equation .",
    "we will derive lemma  [ links - lem ] from two general facts on smooth curves stated in lemma  [ wrap - lem ] and lemma  [ turn - lem ] .",
    "[ wrap - lem ] suppose a string of length @xmath29 is tangent to a point @xmath85 on some smooth curve @xmath86 .",
    "now the end of the string moves a distance of @xmath87 in the direction of @xmath15 , as shown in figure  [ wrapapp - fig ] .",
    "then for the curve length @xmath88 between @xmath85 and the new tangent point , @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the radius of the osculating circle at @xmath85 .",
    "this fact is quite intuitive .",
    "the more perpendicular the motion of the string s endpoint , and the larger the radius of curvature , the more of the string gets wrapped .",
    "but if the string is very long , the effect of the motion decreases .",
    "the center of the osculating circle at @xmath85 is known to be the limit of the intersections of the normals of all points near @xmath85 with the normal at @xmath85 .",
    "lemma  [ turn - lem ] shows what happens if , instead of the normals , we consider the lines turned by the angle @xmath92 .",

    "then their limit intersection point with @xmath94 has distance @xmath95 to @xmath85 .",
    "a simple example is shown in figure  [ wrap - fig ] for the case where curve @xmath86 itself is a circle .",

    "but for the barrier curve  @xmath2 , these turned normals are the tangents to the previous coil , so that @xmath100 holds .",
