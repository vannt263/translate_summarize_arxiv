    "from the emergence of a hydrostatic core , the collapse of a protostellar core is accompanied by winds and mass loss @xcite probably driven by magnetospheric accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "integrated over time , the effect of a wind from a young star is to blow away the material that shrouds it during its earliest evolution .",
    "the discovery of bipolar molecular outflows has been a key to the understanding of this process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* slp hereafter ) .",
    "these molecular outflows have dimensions of up to several parsecs , masses one or two orders of magnitude larger than their driving sources , and tremendous kinetic energies @xcite .",
    "such massive flows must represent swept - up material as the winds , emerging from the star and/or its circumstellar disk , interact with their ambient medium .",
    "one of the important unanswered questions in outflow studies is the mechanism by which the jets / winds emerging from the embedded star / disk entrain and accelerate the surrounding molecular material .",
    "currently there are three scenarios : the `` wide - angle wind '' model in which a wide - angled magnetized wind expands like a bubble and sweeps up the ambient medium in a momentum conserving manner into the shell at the wind - bubble ambient medium interface @xcite .",
    "then there are two types of `` jet '' entrainment models , the  turbulent  jet entrainment model , in which ambient material is accelerated through a turbulent viscous mixing layer that surrounds the jet formed by kelvin - helmholtz instabilities @xcite ; and the  prompt  entrainment model in which bow shock formed in the jet head drives material ahead and laterally to the axis of the flow @xcite .",
    "it is essential to distinguish between these models to not only understand the processes that govern the formation of molecular outflows , but also the nature of the jet / wind launching mechanism and the underlying accretion disk processes .",
    "since it is difficult to observe the jet / wind launching regions directly , the properties of large scale bipolar outflows can shed some light on the nature of their initial conditions .",
    "in addition , the energy and momentum deposited by molecular outflows within the molecular cloud can be large enough to power turbulence in the cloud or even disrupt the parts of the cloud .",
    "understanding outflow properties over the entire outflow history is critical in determine their impact on the cloud .    within the last decade , with the advent of ccd cameras with 20fields - of - view , more than two dozen giant herbig - haro ( hh ) flows with dimensions ranging from 1 to 7 pc have been discovered @xcite .",
    "hh flows are chains of optically visible shock - excited nebulae which , demonstrate the existence , at least during certain evolutionary phases , of exceedingly well collimated and highly supersonic wind components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the tremendous size of parsec - scale outflows implies that molecular material is being entrained at parsec - scale distances from the driving source , and thus it may have a significant impact on the kinematics and energy density of a substantial volume of the parent molecular cloud .",
    "our current estimates of the  typical  outflow properties may be far from accurate , since there is no large homogeneous sample of molecular outflows which have been mapped with good resolution and sensitivity @xcite .",
    "consequently , our current understanding of the processes might be heavily subjective , and biased by a few frequently studied examples .",
    "we have been involved in a multi - wavelength study of a dozen or so parsec - scale outflows , complementing narrow - band optical observations with wide - field , sensitive , multi - transitional co   and co  observations ( stojimirovi et al .",

    "here , we present the detailed results of our multi - wavelength study on the l1551 molecular outflow .",
    "the bipolar molecular outflow associated with the l1551 small dark cloud in the taurus molecular cloud complex , was the first recognized bipolar outflow from a young stellar object ( slp ) and is considered one of the best examples of its kind . at a distance of 140 pc @xcite",

    "we made sensitive , large spatial extent , high spatial and velocity resolution maps at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "large - spatial extent mapping performed on parsec - scale outflows , allows us to study in detail the entrainment mechanisms by which jets / winds drive the observed molecular flows . with the availability of both co  and co  data over the full spatial extent of the flow , we are able to take a _ full _ and proper accounting of the mass and hence energetics of the outflows in the l1551 system . comparing optical and millimeter data ,",
    "we are able to discriminate among entrainment models based on morphological grounds .",
    "a full mapping of co  and co  in the j = 1 @xmath0 0 transition has been performed in several observing seasons over a three - year period with the sequoia receiver at the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) 14  m telescope .",

    "multi - wavelength observations of l1551 cloud conducted through the last 25 years show that the region hosts several young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages and multiple overlapping outflows .",

    "figure  [ fig : l1551_first ] shows the blueshifted and redshifted integrated intensity map of our co  j=1@xmath00  data overlayed on the h@xmath1  image , previously published by @xcite .",
    "there are a number of star - formation sites within the l1551 cloud , some of the most studied are : irs 5 , l1551 ne and the hl tau region .",
    "irs 5 is a deeply embedded class i source @xcite , with bolometric luminosity of 38  @xmath6 @xcite , hidden from the direct view by up to 150 magnitudes of visual extinction @xcite .",
    "it is a close binary system @xcite with components separated by @xmath7 0.@xmath835 @xcite .",
    "located 149  east - northeast from the irs 5 is l1551 ne @xcite , a class 0 source with bolometric luminosity of 4.5  @xmath6 .",
    "radio continuum observations at 3.5 cm suggested @xcite and later confirmed @xcite that l1551 ne is binary source with 0@xmath8.5 separation .",
    "approximately 6  to the north from irs 5 , lies the hl tau region , with two well - studied t - tauri stars , hl and xz tau .",
    "in addition hh 30 * and lkh@xmath1 358 embedded stars are found in the same hl tau region .",
    "numerous jets have been reported emerging from these three embedded systems .",
    "irs 5 which is believed to be the powering source for the large bipolar molecular outflow has two clearly defined jets @xcite .",
    "the measured position angles are pa=247@xmath9 for the northern irs 5 jet and pa=235@xmath10 for the southern irs 5 jet , using 3.5  cm vla observations with resolution of 0.1 @xcite . surprisingly , the position angle of either jet powered by irs 5 is not aligned with the pa=50morphology of the molecular co outflow .",
    "however , the northern irs 5 jet orientation points to two regions along the edges of the bipolar flow where unusually bright and warm `` high - velocity '' cs emission has been seen @xcite .",
    "these regions are 4  west , near hh 102 , and 2  east from irs 5 , at l1551 ne position , and have been hypothesized as working surfaces of the northern irs 5 jet .",
    "it has been speculated that the formation of l1551 ne was induced by the irs 5 outflow impact @xcite .",
    "the l1551 ne binary system is observed to drive a jet delineated by [ fe  ii ]  emission @xcite .",
    "the bright [ s  ii ]  emission hh 454 knots lie within the 2  of the [ fe  ii ]  jet .",
    "the hh 454 - [ fe  ii ]  jet axis has pa @xmath7243 , and we refer to this axis as l1551 ne jet .",
    "proper motion study of the hh 454 knots , show that blueshifted knots are extending toward the southwest and redshifted knots are found toward the northeast from l1551 ne @xcite .",
    "this means that if l1551 ne is capable of entraining co gas in the region , it would be in the same general orientation as the irs 5 outflow .    in the hl tau region",
    "several optically identified jets of high velocity gas are reported @xcite . in the ccd images of @xcite , at least four flows emerge at different angles from four sources .",
    "hl tau drives a jet at pa @xmath7 50 , while xz tau drives a poorly collimated wind , traced by a set of expanding bubbles imaged by hst towards pa @xmath7 20  @xcite .",
    "the hh 30 * source is located 1.5 south of hl tau and its optical jet , stretches several arcmin from the source at pa @xmath7 35/215 .",
    "lkh@xmath1 358 also appears to drive a flow , probably toward pa @xmath7 70/250  and is a likely candidate for the origin of hh 265 object @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : l1551_first ] is dominated by the well known bipolar structure which we will call the main outflow . the main outflow s blueshifted emission lies along pa @xmath7230 and extends 20  southwest from irs 5 .",
    "the main outflow redshifted emission extends 16  north - east of irs 5 along pa @xmath750 .",
    "weak redshifted emission is detected in the far north - east corner of the map and may be related to a further extension of the outflow .",
    "in addition to the bipolar outflow symmetric about irs 5 , there are a number of other features that complicate the outflow .",
    "first , blueshifted emission is detected near the hl tau region , well within the red lobe of l1551 flow , and presumably related to outflow activity in the hl tau region @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature is the previously discovered redshifted component oriented east - west ( ew flow ) that lies north of the blueshifted main outflow @xcite .",
    "finally , a blueshifted feature , can be seen extending into the main redshifted outflow lobe to the north - east beyond hh 262 @xcite and may be connected to the ew flow ; an idea that will be discussed in more detail later in the paper .    @xcite reported the discovery of hh 286 , making the whole extent of the optical flow 1.3 pc between hh 286 and hh 256 .",
    "the molecular outflow extends slightly beyond hh 256 in the south - west , however the outflow terminates short of hh 286 .",
    "the full extent of the co outflow is approximately 32 which corresponds to 1.3 pc at the distance of l1551 cloud .",
    "therefore the spatial extents of the optical and co outflows , are the same although displaced .",
    "our co maps extend well beyond hh 286 and in figure  [ fig:12cocore ] and figure  [ fig:13co ] we show the integrated intensity maps of the co  and co  j=1@xmath00  emission within the velocity range of the line core . the co  j=1@xmath00  map of the line core emission provides our best measure of the distribution of ambient velocity gas .",
    "both figures clearly illustrate that there is no molecular gas at the position of the hh 286 .",
    "thus , the molecular outflow ends short of hh 286 because there is no molecular material to be entrained in the outflow .      in figures  [ fig : l1551_first ] and [ fig : co32 ] we show the integrated intensity maps of the redshifted and blueshifted outflowing gas in the co  j=1@xmath00  and j=3@xmath02  transitions overlayed on an image of h@xmath1  emission .",
    "the spatial extent of the j=3@xmath02map is considerably smaller than that of the j=1@xmath00  transition .",
    "although the outflow appears more collimated in the j=3@xmath02  map , this is largely due to the restricted angular extent of the map , which did not cover either the hl tau or ew outflow regions .",
    "the j=3@xmath02  data is primarily useful in probing the inner regions of the main flow at higher angular resolution .    in the following three sections",
    ", we will discuss in detail the velocity field associated with the molecular gas within the different flows in l1551 .",
    "we will discuss the main , hl tau , and ew outflows .      in figures  [ fig : mosaic_blue]a and [ fig",
    ": mosaic_blue_submm]a the lowest velocity blueshifted emission is shown . in the larger j=1@xmath00  map ( see figure  [ fig : mosaic_blue]a ) one can identify the blue lobe associated with the main outflow , a bow - shaped emission feature associated with hl tau , and a feature extending north - east from the main flow toward hh 262 . the blue lobe of the main flow has a parabolic shell structure that originates at irs 5 , with irs 5 embedded within it .",
    "this parabolic shell encompasses most of the h@xmath1  emission and is best delineated in the higher angular resolution image of the j=3@xmath02transition of co seen in figure  [ fig : mosaic_blue_submm ] .    at higher",
    "blueshifted velocities the emission becomes more collimated and is confined closer to the outflow axis .",
    "the nested velocity structure for the blue lobe of this outflow is very well known .",
    "the emission ( see figure  [ fig : mosaic_blue_submm]b , c ) predominantly arises in three clumps associated with hh 29 , hh 259 and hh 102 . for the clumps associated with hh 29 and hh 259 , the strongest co j=3@xmath02emission lags behind the optically defined shock regions . at the highest blueshifted velocities , ( see figures  [ fig : mosaic_blue]d and [ fig : mosaic_blue_submm]d ) , the emission is confined to a region located toward the end of the outflow cavity defined by the optical emission , near hh 259 .",
    "the alignment of the hh 454a , hh 29 , hh 259 , hh 28 with l1551 ne jet axis and the proper motion studies of hh 28 and hh 29 have been used to suggest that they share a common origin in l1551 ne @xcite .",
    "if indeed this is the case , it is possible that some of the blue emission we see in the main flow may originate in material entrained by l1551 ne outflow .    in figures  [ fig : mosaic_red ] and [ fig : mosaic_red_submm ] , we show mosaics of integrated intensity channel maps of the redshifted co  emission . besides the main flow , at the lowest redshifted velocities in the larger j=1@xmath00  map",
    ", the beginning of the ew flow can be seen .",
    "the velocity structure in the redshifted gas of the main flow shows some similarities to that of the blue lobe .",
    "again , there is evidence for a nested velocity structure , however the exact interpretation is complicated by the presence of hl tau . in figure",
    "[ fig : mosaic_red]a one can see an extension of redshifted emission from irs 5 to the north towards hl tau",
    ". this emission could either be part of a parabolic shell morphology of the main red lobe , or emission associated with the hl tau outflow .",
    "as in the blue lobe , the higher velocity emission is offset from irs 5 and confined closer to the outflow axis and the highest velocity emission is located near the end of the outflow near hh 262 .",
    "maybe the most tantalizing evidence of molecular emission associated with l1551 ne jet is seen in figure  [ fig : mosaic_red_submm]a , b where there is a linear emission feature that arises close to ne and extends for approximately 5  to the north - east , close to the hh 262 .",
    "the position angle of this linear feature is @xmath7 60 similar to the orientation of the [ fe  ii ]   jet driven by l1551 ne @xcite .",
    "a similar suggestion was made by @xcite .",
    "however , the feature could instead be just part of the parabolic shell associated with the main flow from irs 5 .",
    "the radial velocity of hh 262 indicates that it is redshifted @xcite and that it may be either related to l1551 ne or the outflow associated with irs 5 .",
    "unfortunately , our submillimeter map is not complete in the region surrounding hh 262 .    to better show the complex velocity structure within the l1551 outflows , we construct position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams by averaging the spectra perpendicular to the p - v axis over a finite width . in figure  [ fig : pv_irs5 ] we show a p - v diagram constructed from the j=1@xmath00  data with a width of 2.25 .",
    "the p - v diagram is aligned along the main outflow axis ( at a position angle of 50 ) and passes through irs 5 ( at zero offset ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : pv_submm ] shows the p - v diagram constructed from the j=3@xmath02  data along the the same axis with a width of 1.1 .    in the red lobe of the main flow ,",
    "the velocity structure is relatively simple , with velocity increasing approximately linearly with distance from irs 5 ( figure  [ fig : pv_irs5 ] ) .",
    "such velocity structure is often dubbed as `` hubble '' flow and corresponding feature in the p - v diagram a hubble wedge .",
    "the velocity field within the hubble wedge shows a systematic acceleration , with both the terminal flow velocity as well as the mean velocity both increasing within the wedge .",
    "the terminal velocity in the redshifted lobe is reached near hh 262 at an offset of approximately + 11  from irs 5 , where outflow terminates at all velocities , although cloud emission continues .",
    "the velocity field in the blue lobe of the main flow is more structured than in the red lobe .",
    "the inner region of the outflow is shown in the p - v plot of the j=3@xmath02  transition of co , figure  [ fig : pv_submm ] . in this higher resolution",
    "p - v diagram , irs 5 is clearly the symmetry point between the redshifted and blueshifted outflow lobes . in the blue lobe , hubble wedges associated with hh 29 and hh",
    "259 can be distinguished .",
    "the more extended , but lower resolution p - v diagram , constructed from co j=1@xmath00  transition , shows possible additional hubble wedge features near hh 29 , hh 259 , hh 28 and hh 256 .",
    "the presence of multiple hubble wedges has been interpreted as due to either episodic or multiple outflow events @xcite .",
    "low velocity outflow emission is detected out to an offset position of -18 , near the edge of the molecular cloud .",
    "thus , the blue flow may be escaping the cloud , while the red flow is stopped within the molecular cloud .",
    "the different velocity structure of the red and blue lobes may reflect the differences in the underlying ambient gas distribution .",
    "we also made p - v plots ( not shown here ) along the l1551 ne jet axis , and these plots are very similar to those shown in figures  [ fig : pv_irs5 ] and [ fig : pv_submm ] .",
    "however , in these plots the location of l1551 ne is clearly offset relatively to the symmetry point of the inner redshifted and blueshifted hubble wedges .",
    "the most prominent feature associated with the hl tau flow is the clam - shell morphology of the blueshifted co emission seen in figure  [ fig : mosaic_blue]a .",
    "this feature is centered on the hl tau jet axis ( pa @xmath7 50 , @xcite ) and opens toward hh 266 .",
    "it is likely that this feature reflects the collective impact of several flows on surrounding gas . as mentioned earlier , it is problematic to define the redshifted emission associated with the hl tau flow since it overlaps main flow s redshifted emission . figure  [ fig : mosaic_red]b shows a linear feature extending north - east from the hl tau region and well aligned with the direction of the hh 30 jet ( pa @xmath7 31 , @xcite ) .",
    "the resolution of our j=1@xmath00  data does not allow us to study the details of the hl tau flow and the j=3@xmath02  map did not extend to this region .      in figure",
    "[ fig : ew ] we show a mosaic of integrated intensity maps within successive 4  kms@xmath3  wide redshifted velocity intervals for the ew flow .",
    "we have not overlaid the h@xmath1  optical image on the ew flow , because the ew flow extends well beyond the coverage of the optical image .",
    "the portion of the ew outflow covered by the optical image , with exception of hh 102 , shows no bright optical features associated with the flow .",
    "the ew flow has a length of approximately 21(corresponding to 0.85 pc at 140 pc distance ) and has a relatively large velocity extent ranging from about 8  kms@xmath3  to 20  kms@xmath3 .",
    "this flow is highly collimated at all velocities .",
    "the ew flow appears to originate near hh 102 and at successive higher velocities the emission is further offset from the origin .",
    "the hubble flow character to the velocity structure of ew flow is also shown in the p - v plot constructed from the j=1@xmath00  co data , figure  [ fig : pv_ew ] .",
    "the p - v plot passes through hh 102 ( the zero offset position ) and is at position angle 270 .",
    "the outflow emission in the ew flow is much weaker than in the main flow , so the p - v plot is much noisier .",
    "however , there is evidence for a hubble flow feature that terminates at a v@xmath11 of @xmath12  kms@xmath3  at an offset position of approximately 16 .",
    "we speculate that the blueshifted counterpart to the ew red flow is the feature seen in figure  [ fig : mosaic_red]a extending into the red lobe of the main outflow .",
    "if this feature is related to the ew flow , the redshifted and blueshifted flows are not co - linear and would require that the blueshifted portion of the flow curves northward .",
    "the corresponding blueshifted feature that we tentatively identified with ew outflow is not seen in the p - v diagram since it curves north and does not lie along the east - west axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : l1551_first ] , however , provides a good overview of the possible connection of these two velocity features .",
    "it is intriguing that the high velocity dense gas clumps detected in cs by @xcite are located near l1551 ne and hh 102 . based on the interferometer results , @xcite and @xcite suggested that ne was formed in a swept - up shell of gas produced by the irs 5 outflow .",
    "the spatial and velocity structure of the cs emission toward hh 102 is similar to that near ne .",
    "we speculate , that like ne , the outflow from irs 5 may have triggered another star formation event within the dense shell of swept - up gas near hh 102 .",
    "additional evidence for the interaction of the irs 5 jet with material in this region is provided by the optical spectroscopy of hh 264 , presented by @xcite .",
    "in fact , recently , @xcite detected relatively strong far - infrared dust emission at 850 @xmath13 m toward hh 102 .",
    "due to insufficient spatial resolution they were not able to conclude if there is any point source within the extended structure .",
    "thus , a newly formed star in this region may be responsible for producing the ew flow and its blueshifted counterpart .",
    "the l1551 cloud contains over a dozen young stellar objects concentrated in a region less than 1 pc in diameter and many have associated hh objects or molecular outflow activity , all of which attest to the overall complexity of the l1551 region .",
    "we define four areas of interest to study the molecular outflow activity and these are shown in figure  [ fig : mv_regions ] . since the mass distribution along the outflow can be a good indicator of the entrainment mechanism , the idea is to isolate the various outflow components as much as possible .",
    "regions a1 and a2 mark the blue and redshifted lobes of the main outflow .",
    "we also separately analyze the blueshifted emission in region a2 , which may be associated with the ew outflow .",

    "we have made no attempt to correct for the inclination of the outflow , so these are only lower limits to the true values of momentum and kinetic energy .",
    "not correcting for the inclination of the outflow , will not affect the mass estimate , since accounting for the tangential velocity will only rescale the velocity axis .",
    "the highest uncertainty in the mass estimates , factor of 2 , comes from the uncertainty in the n@xmath47 to n@xmath49 ratio @xcite .",

    "our study as well as the studies of @xcite have mapped a larger area of the outflow lobes than most previous studies ( primarily due to the higher sensitivities of receivers and the advent of otf mapping ) .",
    "the size of the mapped region is probably not the cause of difference in derived value of @xmath62 .",
    "\\(2 ) the exact form for the functional fit to the velocity dependent opacity correction can affect the slopes of the mass spectra . in the studies of @xcite",
    ", parabolic fits were used to extrapolate the value of the ratio ( @xmath86co/@xmath87co ) beyond values where the ratio is well determined .",
    "we use a logarithmic function ( see figure  [ fig : averaged ] ) instead .",
    "the logarithmic function is a better fit to the variation of the ratio seen in our data , but it tends to be a more slowly varying function with velocity than the parabolic fits .",
    "this makes for larger corrections ( more mass ) for the higher velocity points , which in turn makes the mass spectral slopes shallower .",
    "it should be noted that , compared to earlier studies , our data have higher sensitivity even at higher velocities from the systemic velocity , and this leads to a better constraint of the @xmath86co/@xmath87co ratio to much higher velocities .",
    "the variation of optical depth of co in molecular outflows with velocity has not been well determined to high velocities",
    ". however , when high signal - to - noise ratio spectral data have been obtained towards high velocity molecular outflows , the ratio of @xmath86co/@xmath87co seems to be slowly varying with velocity @xcite , as is seen in our study .",
    "as another example , in figures 7(c ) and 7(d ) of @xcite , it is seen that the ratio of @xmath86co/@xmath87co seems to be actually flat , however , the authors use a parabolic fit .",
    "a parabolic fit is a much faster extrapolation function in velocity and predicts that the gas gets to the optically thin limit at lower velocity offsets from the systemic velocity .",
    "\\(3 ) previous studies of mass spectra apply a method of only using data which exceeds a specified threshold in rms value of @xmath88 . for example , @xcite used a 2@xmath32 threshold , while @xcite used a 1@xmath32 threshold .",
    "figure  [ fig : rms_vs_norms ] shows the effect of using a rms threshold in the determination of the mass spectra .",
    "the rms thresholding method preferentially rejects points at higher velocity channels , since those points have the lowest signal to noise , and hence do not meet the rms threshold .",
    "because of this , mass is under - estimated preferentially at higher velocities , thereby artificially steepening the mass - spectral slopes .    the velocity - dependent optical depth correction used in @xcite as also in this work does result in more accurate mass determinations .",
    "in particular , not using the correction results in an under - estimation of the mass at especially lower velocities , artificially giving low mass - spectra slopes . on the other hand ,",
    "care must be taken with the functional form of the fit of optical depth with velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : rms_vs_norms ] shows the importance of using all the data or at least being aware of the effect that posing a specified threshold in rms value will have on mass spectrum .",
    "the mass for the l1551 cloud estimated from the fully sample co  map at line core velocities of 5 to 8  kms@xmath3  is @xmath89  m@xmath69 . outside of the line core velocities ,",
    "the total mass estimated in the outflow is @xmath90  m@xmath69 for @xmath50  k or @xmath91  m@xmath69 for @xmath51  k. therefore the mass in the outflow is approximately 5 - 6.5@xmath92 of the mass of surrounding cloud , depending on the adopted value for the @xmath93 . the total momentum and energy carried by the outflow , estimated from only the line of sight ( radial ) velocity , is 20  @xmath94kms@xmath3and 1.5@xmath95 ergs , respectively .",
    "it it usually assumed that the l1551 outflows have small inclination angles relatively to the plane of the sky , so there is a large inclination correction to the momentum and energy determinations .",
    "however , since the inclination angle is extremely uncertain , we will use the values quoted above as lower limits to the true values .",
    "many authors suggest that outflows provide a mechanism to regulate star formation by removal of the gas from star - forming regions , especially in the regions that lack massive stars ( eg .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) . for the outflow entrained gas , to escape from the cloud",
    ", it must be moving at least at the escape velocity . using a mass of 110 m@xmath69 and @xmath96  pc radius for the cloud",
    ", the escape velocity is calculated to be @xmath97  kms@xmath3 .",
    "if all of the momentum of the outflowing molecular gas was transferred to the cloud uniformly , then the gas would not escape .",
    "however , since outflows are highly collimated , momentum is transferred non - uniformly and much of the present outflowing molecular gas is likely to escape , unless it is slowed down by encounters with ambient gas .",
    "our observations suggest that in fact the main blue lobe has broken out of the cloud near hh 256 , and that their is insufficient column density of gas to slow the gas as it escapes",
    ". however , in the main red lobe , the molecular outflow is still well within the boundaries of the cloud and it remains to be determined if there is sufficient column density of gas to halt the outflow .",
    "thus , the outflows are unlikely to disperse the entire cloud , but in local regions will be a major agent for disruption .",
    "the total binding energy of the cloud is given by @xmath98 .",
    "using a cloud mass of 110 m@xmath69 and @xmath99  pc for the cloud radius , we find the binding energy to be 2@xmath100  ergs .",
    "thus , the energy of the outflow 1.5 - 2@xmath100  ergs , is comparable to the binding energy of the cloud , even if no correction for the inclination angle is made .",
    "it has been suggested that parsec - scale outflows can be a source of energy to replace the energy dissipated in turbulence and thus provide the power to maintain the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite .",
    "the rate of turbulent energy dissipation can be estimated from equation ( 7 ) in @xcite . assuming a cloud mass of 110  m@xmath69 and a mean turbulent velocity dispersion of 0.45  kms@xmath3  ( estimated from the co   line width )",
    ", we find that the energy dissipation rate of turbulence in l1551 cloud is 0.003  l@xmath101 .",
    "thus , if even a small fraction of the outflow energy could be coupled into cloud turbulence , the outflow could sustain the turbulence for over a million years , much greater than the lifetimes of molecular outflows .",
    "we have shown that the molecular outflows contain substantial kinetic energy .",
    "however , the effect outflows have on their parent clouds depends on the efficiency in which momentum and energy can be transferred from the outflowing molecular gas to the surrounding cloud material .",
    "currently , the observations are insufficient to answer this question , and there are no good theoretical models that address the effect outflows have on disruption of the cloud or on their role in replenishing the reservoir of turbulence energy in clouds . however , our work and several recent studies of parsec scale outflows , suggest that young stars , through the combined effect of their outflows , may have an important impact on the dispersal of their parent molecular cloud and to power turbulent motions .",
    "the l1551 molecular core is an active star - forming region which harbors at least 2 small clusters of protostars , one centered in the irs  5 and l1551 ne region , and another in the hl  tau region . these two mini - clusters are clearly undergoing active star - formation characterized by hh objects , optical and near - infrared jets .",
    "in addition , multi - wavelength surveys in mid infrared @xcite , x - ray @xcite , optical and near - ir @xcite , optical spectra @xcite , and in h@xmath1 @xcite have shown that the whole l1551 molecular core is surrounded by a halo of young stars in the class ii stage or older , indicating that star - formation activity has been ongoing in this region for at least a few million years . here",
    ", we explore the possibility that the current epoch of star - formation activity in l1551 may be the result of sequential star - formation induced by the effects of the multiple outflows in the system .",
    "the protobinary system in irs 5 has two active jets .",
    "the current direction of either of these jets is not aligned with the @xmath102  oriented main co outflow in this region , the latter being driven by the source(s ) at irs 5 . at least at some point in the past",
    ", the predominant direction of the jets from the irs  5 system was probably aligned with the bulk molecular outflow direction in l1551 .",
    "it has been suggested that l1551 ne was formed in the swept - up shell of gas produced by the irs 5 outflow @xcite .",
    "l1551 ne is itself a multiple stellar system , and possesses optical jets , and is thought to power a large - scale hh flow including hh 454 , hh 28 and hh 29 @xcite .",
    "the evidence for a co outflow from l1551 ne is not as clear - cut despite many observational attempts to delineate the outflow , mostly because of its similar alignment and close proximity to the main flow from irs 5 .",
    "the high angular resolution interferometric observations of @xcite and @xcite show two symmetric cs structures , one eastward from irs  5 near l1551 ne , and thought to be responsible for the formation of l1551 ne , and another near hh 102 .",
    "as discussed before , with the presence of a 850 @xmath13 m dust - continuum clump near hh 102 @xcite , it is tempting to suggest that a similar triggering mechanism can be attributed to the ew outflow .",
    "it is possible that the same bipolar jet streaming eastward started the star - formation process in l1551 ne , and streaming westward , started the star - formation process in the clump near hh 102 .",
    "this new driving source near hh 102 is maybe responsible for the ew flow .",
    "this new protostar is obscured in the hh 102 region , and the highly collimated co outflow , and the jet - like characteristics of the ew flow are indeed consistent with a relatively young protostellar system .",
    "follow - up high angular resolution observations of the hh 102 region would allow us to probe the possibility that there is a new embedded source near hh 102 .",
    "the evidence for sequential star - formation activity is further strengthened by some recent observations of the l1551 region . a new pre - protostellar clump ,",
    "dubbed l1551-mc has been discovered near hh 265 @xcite using nh@xmath103 observations , and later confirmed @xcite by 850 @xmath13 m continuum observations .",
    "l1551-mc is located at the edge of hh 265 , which may be a hh object at the end of a jet arising from a driving source within the hl tau complex ( see figure 17 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the next generation of star - formation in the l1551 molecular cloud could occur at the l1551-mc region .",
    "all l1551 molecular outflows have been mapped at high sensitivities in the co  and co  j=1@xmath00  transitions . follow - up submillimeter observations in co  j=3@xmath02  emission towards a good fraction of the l1551 outflow system were carried out as well .",
    "the millimeter and submillimeter data are combined with large - scale , narrow band , optical h@xmath1 images in order to perform a detailed study of the outflows in l1551 .",
    "the main conclusions of the paper are summarized below .    1 .",
    "the full extent of the main co outflow is 32  ( 1.3 pc ) , and is oriented at @xmath104  position angle .",
    "the molecular outflow extent is similar to the optical extent of the flow seen by @xcite .",
    "outflowing molecular material extends well beyond the last known hh object , hh 256 in the south - west , but stops short of hh 286 in the north - east .",
    "our molecular line maps indicate that hh 286 has completely exited the l1551 cloud",
    "most of the co molecular outflow appears to be driven by source(s ) in the irs 5 region .",
    "some features , especially in the redshifted lobe of the outflow may be attributed to outflows originating in l1551 ne and the hl tau region .",
    "3 .   our maps cover a much larger extent of the collimated redshifted ew flow .",
    "the ew flow is @xmath105 pc in length , and is @xmath106 pc in width .",
    "in contrast to earlier studies , the sensitivity in our data reveals that the ew flow extends to high velocities ( 6.5  kms@xmath3  to 20  kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "it is suggested that a smaller extent blueshifted component seen in the main northwestern redshifted lobe is the blueshifted counterpart of the ew flow , and that the driving source for the ew flow is close to the location of hh 102 .",
    "we refine the procedure of velocity - dependent opacity correction adopted by recent authors to obtain a more accurate determination of outflow mass with velocity .",
    "the resultant mass - spectral power law indices are lower ( less steep ) than recently obtained indices towards other outflows .",
    "we attribute this systematic difference in power - law index to the better quality of our data , and the more careful approach we use in calculating mass .",
    "the resulting mass of the l1551 molecular cloud core is @xmath89  m@xmath101 and the combined mass of the outflows in l1551 is @xmath107  m@xmath101 .",
    "5 .   even for no inclination angle correction , and lower @xmath93 assumption ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the outflow is comparable to the binding energy of the cloud and there seems to be enough outflow energy to maintain turbulence in the cloud .",
    "therefore the parsec scale outflow in l1551 has a potential of making a strong impact on the cloud s evolution and fate .",
    "multiple lines of evidence from @xmath65  spectral indices , position velocity plots , and morphological appearance of our multi - wavelength data indicate that the ew molecular outflow is a good example of jet - driven bow shock entrainment .",
    "the main molecular outflow in l1551 shows evidence for entrainment from both jet - driven and wind - driven mechanisms .",
    "we suggest that new stars are being triggered to form in the l1551 system as a result of the effects of the multiple outflows in the region .",
