    "it is worth recalling that when there is _ no _ size - disparity ( @xmath75 ) , the geometric forces are identically zero .",

    "we note that the scaling of the geometric forces ( @xmath97 ) suggests that they can be compared to the effective percolation force of rosato et al.@xcite , and hence we have a competition between buoyancy and percolation forces . in the percolation - condensation mechanism of hong",
    "et al.@xcite , the condensation is driven by the two - species having different energies . if one equates their driving force due to condensation - tendency with an effective buoyancy force , then our mechanism could be equivalent to that of hong et al . however , there is no direct one - to - one analogy between our hydrodynamic segregation mechanism and the percolation - condensation mechanism .    in conclusion , we have identified four different types of segregation forces : apart from the archimedean buoyancy force and an analog of the thermal buoyancy force",

    "we have demonstrated that the competition between the buoyancy and geometric forces determines the onset of segregation in the present scenario , and the inclusion of the pseudo - thermal buoyancy force ( due to inelastic dissipation ) further enhances the possibility of bnp . while the possibility of rbnp is rather limited in the single intruder limit , even at moderate dissipation - levels , either increasing the relative volume fraction of the intruders or decreasing the mean volume fraction",
