    "a spatially inhomogeneous laser detuned from the appropriate transitions between internal ( qubit ) states of an ion ( a two - level system with pauli matrices @xmath5 ) produces a ponderomotive force @xmath6 due to the gradient in its intensity .",
    "using an appropriate combination of polarizations and frequencies , in analogy with alkali atoms @xcite , the sign of the force becomes dependent upon the internal state of the ion , with the associated perturbation to the system : @xmath7 \\sigma^z_i \\label{e : force}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the displacement of ion @xmath9 away from its equilibrium position .",
    "the latter can take place either along the separation between two individual ion microtraps @xcite or perpendicularly to the plane of an ion wigner crystal in a penning trap @xcite . in both schemes , as the ion displacements are coupled ( via phonons ) , such a push leads to an effective @xmath10 interaction .",
    "adiabaticity is required for vibrational excitations to be absent after the gate .",
    "this bounds the clock speed to be lower than the frequency of trapping in the push direction : tight traps are needed for fast , temperature - insensitive operation .",
    "we now introduce a simple variant of the fast - kick `` push '' gate which allows us to use even the soft ( lateral ) modes when their temperature is extremely high .",
    "our variant uses slow modulation of a fast , oscillating state - dependent force .",
    "the oscillation averages any ion motion to zero over the course of the gate , while the in - phase oscillation of nearby ions leads to a non - trivial phase evolution and the desired quantum gate between ions in the crystal .",
    "in addition , as our gate allows for non - trivial oscillation of ion positions in all three spatial dimensions ( versus only in the tightly confined direction for the vertical gate ) , it can work using a single laser beam and in three dimensional crystals .",
    "it is instructive to recall the general description of `` push '' phase gates when in a complex crystal  @xcite .",
    "we start by rewriting the hamiltonian of @xmath11 interacting ions to second order in displacement from the equilibrium positions @xmath12 , using normal - mode coordinates indexed by @xmath13 ( the wavevector and polarization ) , @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 are the oscillator ground state lengths ; the matrix @xmath16 is orthogonal ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the perturbation @xmath18 can now be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the state - dependent force on normal mode @xmath21 defined via the transformaton @xmath16 and eqn .",
    "[ e : force ] .",
    "the problem factorizes into @xmath22 independent , driven oscillators . for scenarios with @xmath23 ,",
    "the oscillator evolution is given by the unitary transform @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy the differential equations  @xcite @xmath27\\ ] ] which are exact to second order .",
    "we now seek an approach which still maintains no net change in displacement and no dependence of the overall phase on phonon state , but can operate on time scales on the order of @xmath28 .",
    "we add a sinusoidal variation to the force [ @xmath29 .",
    "the carrier frequencies @xmath30 must be fast with respect to @xmath28 ; qualitatively , this averages out any net displacement .",
    "if the modulation @xmath31 is slow as compared to @xmath30 ( but with no restriction with respect to @xmath28 ) , we can perform a similar adiabatic elimination as above , and get a gate with the same desirable properties that can operate non - trivially on arbitrarily `` soft '' phonon modes at very high tempeatures .    for adiabatic elimination with respect to @xmath30",
    ", we choose the ansatz @xmath32 ( subscripts omitted for clarity ) . setting @xmath33 yields @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "we find the displacement of a normal mode induced by the gate is proportional to the force applied , and can be made zero independent of initial phonon state by starting and ending with zero force .",
    "this eliminates any potential error due to entanglement between phonons and the internal states of the ions .",
    "we now examine the two - body phase induced in this new scenario .",
    "the differential equation for phase is now : @xmath35 averaging the quickly varying component lets us replace @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "returning the mode index , @xmath21 , we find the overall phase accumulated , @xmath38 , for a gate occurring over a time 0 to @xmath39 does not depend on the phonon initial state",
    ". however , the internal states of the ions are affected by the unitary @xmath40 where the two - body phases are given by @xmath41 the pulse - shape independent form factor is @xmath42 ( the polarization vectors @xmath43 only depend on @xmath44 ) .    expanding in inverse powers of the large carrier frequency @xmath30",
    ", we note that the first term , @xmath45 , is proportional to @xmath46 ( due to the orthogonality of the matrix @xmath16 ) .",
    "the first non - zero term is @xmath47 .",
    "compared to adiabatic gates , this modulated - carrier push gate is inverted in sign and reduced in phase by a factor @xmath48 . for lateral gates , @xmath49 is a characteristic confinement energy for a single ion in the crystal , and for vertical gates , @xmath50 .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of the modulated - carrier gate s performance for finite - size 2d and 3d wigner crystals ( @xmath51 shown in fig .",
    "[ f : gates ] ) to compare to the equivalent adiabatic gate and the proposed vertical gate of ref .  .",
    "our simulations minimized the classical energy of the ions in a penning trap to determine the equilibrium configuration .",
    "then , expanding to second order in displacements from equilibrium , the normal mode coordinates were found .",
    "coriolis forces were neglected ; their inclusion does not qualitatively change our results .",
    "a gate between the two centermost ions was simulated by computing the displacement @xmath26 and phase @xmath25 for each phonon mode .",
    "the fidelity was calculated by considering the overlap of the final state with the desired state , traced over the phonon degrees of freedom and minimized over all possible initial states .",
    "we find that for the same physical parameters , the ratio of forces ( i.e. , laser power ) required for achieving a @xmath52 phase for the vertical gate and the fast carrier gate goes as @xmath53 , consistent with the ratio between adiabatic and fast carrier gates derived above .",
    "thus , the fast carrier gate requires substantially less laser power for the same conditions with negligible reduction in fidelity .",
    "alternatively , the gate time could be reduced , enhancing the overall performance of quantum information protocols . for specificity , setting @xmath54 khz , @xmath55 mhz , and a gate time @xmath56s",
    ", we find @xmath57 mhz provides @xmath58 with negligible heating .",
    "even smaller errors are found in simulations of the 3d crystal under the same approximations .",
    "a practical limitation occurs due to the spontaneous emission induced by the off - resonant laser interactions .",
    "tight focusing increases the force for the same laser power ; thus , using a pair of adjacent , narrow - waist ( @xmath59 m ) laser beams reduces spontaneous emission and power requirements . for specificity , using a transition with spontaneous emission of @xmath60 mhz and lasers with peak rabi frequency of 100 ghz",

    "anharmonic corrections to the fidelity are not included here . for this choice of parameters , the vertical gate @xcite requires 20 times the force ( and laser power ) of our fast carrier gate to achieve the same final @xmath52 two - body phase .",

    "we now consider an approach that takes advantage of the coulomb interactions in the lattice to create and dynamically extend a cluster state for universal measurement - based computation .",

    "this can be achieved if @xmath67 is made to vanish along one side of each lattice cell , and to be @xmath52 on the other two .",
