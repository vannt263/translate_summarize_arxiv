    "the outer solar system ( hereafter oss ) is a home of the oort cloud of comets @xcite  an extended reservoir of primitive objects that provides a source of the long - period comets observed in the inner solar system ( hereafter iss ) .",
    "we define oss as the region of space outside the helioshere  the inner part of the solar system within about 250 au from the sun @xcite affected by the solar wind .",
    "the population of comets in the outer region of the oort cloud ( @xmath5 au ) is estimated at @xmath6 objects larger than 2.3 km , based on observations of long - period comets in the iss @xcite .",
    "the nature of the inner parts of the oort cloud ( @xmath7 au ) , while potentially more populated , is not as well known because objects on keplerian orbits originating in this region are not likely to reach inside the orbit of jupiter because of the weaker influence of the galactic tide @xcite .    some of the oort cloud s properties have been inferred from numerical studies of its formation and dynamics . the first numerical study of this sort conducted by @xcite produced an oort cloud with a sharp inner edge at @xmath8 au and a density profile of @xmath9 between @xmath10 au and @xmath11 au",
    ". a later work by @xcite also finds @xmath12 au , but an outer edge as far as @xmath13 au .",
    "the observed distribution of long - period comets indicates that their source population extends inward to about 3,000 au but does not provide information about nearer distances @xcite .",
    "these simulations model the formation of the solar system in isolation .",
    "however , the sun is thought to have formed in a cluster environment , which could have resulted in stronger external tides , truncating the cloud @xcite .",
    "focusing on this possibility , @xcite find that oort cloud objects could form with semi - major axes as small as 100 au .",
    "the discovery of kuiper belt objects like ( 90377 ) sedna , which has a perihelion of 76 au ( too far to be affected by planetary perturbations ) and an aphelion of @xmath14 au has led to speculation of an `` inner oort cloud '' that extends significantly closer than 3,000 au @xcite .",
    "an added complication is that the inner part of the oort cloud is not necessarily isotropic , but may form a thick disk concentrated near the ecliptic .",
    "@xcite find that the isotropization radius may be anywhere from 200 au to @xmath15 au , depending on the density of the parent cluster in which the sun has formed . in any case",
    ", it may be several times @xmath16 .",
    "given these uncertainties about the cloud properties , any additional independent ways of gaining information about its structure and characteristics become extremely valuable . here",
    "we explore the possibility of probing the cloud structure indirectly via the _ measurements of properties of dust particles _ that ought to be produced in the oort cloud in _ collisions of its constituent comets_.    previously , comets have been invoked to explain the origin of dust particles observed in the iss in two possible contexts .",
    "first , jupiter - family comets  relatively short - period comets thought to originate in the kuiper belt @xcite  are considered as one of the sources for the zodiacal cloud particles in the iss @xcite .",
    "this source is very different from the oort cloud population , which we consider in this work .",
    "second , disruptions of the long - period oort cloud comets _ in the iss _ due to non - gravitational forces were explored by @xcite as the source of relatively large ( @xmath17 m ) earth - crossing dust particles .",
    "our work is distinct from @xcite in that it focuses on the _ in situ _ production of dust particles in cometary collisions _ in the oort cloud itself _ , i.e. far from the sun .",
    "the production rate of cometary dust in the oort cloud , as we show later , is a sensitive function of both the spatial distribution of comets inside the cloud and their physical properties .",
    "if these particles end up in the iss , the measurement of their characteristics can _ inform us about the cloud s properties_. it is obvious that inferring the latter via observations of cometary dust is a two - step exercise  one needs to understand both the _ production _ of cometary dust inside the cloud and its subsequent _ transport _ into the iss . in this work",
    "we address both aspects of the problem .",
    "the dynamics of small particles in the iss is largely determined by the effects of the solar wind , radiation forces and planetary perturbations @xcite .",
    "however , in the oss the trajectories of cometary dust particles must be dominated by a different set of forces ( besides the solar gravity ) .",
    "since the solar wind does not penetrate beyond the heliosphere , the oort cloud at distances @xmath18 au is directly exposed to an unperturbed flow of interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the latter arises because the sun moves at a velocity of @xmath19 km s@xmath4 through the warm phase of the ism , which is characterized by a gas number density @xmath20 @xmath21 , temperature @xmath22 k , and ionization fraction @xmath23 ( frisch 2009 ) .",
    "the strength and orientation of the magnetic field carried with the wind are rather uncertain , but a typical estimate is @xmath24 g ( opher 2009 )",
    ". a summary of the ism wind parameters from the literature can be found in table [ ismmodels ] .",
    "the values adopted in this study , which we base on the most recent measurements , are listed in the first row .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ dust ]    in this work we explore the dynamics of dust grains produced in the oort cloud by analytic theory and numerical simulations , building off the work of br10 .",
    "based on the observations above and the dynamical arguments below , particles with a size of 1 - 3 @xmath0 ( a regime accessible to spacecraft particle detectors ) appear to be of most interest .",
    "our calculations provide us with a test of techniques to determine the inner edge of the oort cloud and the spatial distribution of dust production inside the cloud .",
    "in addition to learning about the local ism properties and the oort cloud itself , this will help to assess the possibility ( first mentioned in frisch et al .",
    "1999 ) that anomalous large `` interstellar '' dust grains observed by _ ulysses _ , _ galileo _ , and _ cassini _",
    "@xcite have an oort cloud origin .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start by describing the processes responsible for transporting cometary dust grains from the oort cloud into the iss . in  [ perturbations ] we discuss the forces affecting dust grains in the oss , while in  [ sect : small_dyn ] we investigate analytically the grain motion arising from these forces , including observables in the iss .",
    "we present our numerical simulations in  [ numerical ] , calculate the production rate of cometary dust in the oort cloud in  [ sect : dust_prod ] , and compare the simulations against our analytical results in  [ sect : disc ] .",
    "we discuss the limitations of our calculations in  [ sect : cav ] and , finally , applications of our results in section [ sect : concl ] .",
    "br10 have analyzed forces acting on dust grains of different sizes in the oss as the sun traverses the different phases of the ism .",
    "for the warm phase through which the sun is passing right now , they find that the effects of radiation forces and the galactic tide are negligible compared with the other forces that we discuss next .",
    "we start with electromagnetic forces which owe their existence to the fact that ( 1 ) the ism is magnetized ( see table [ ismmodels ] ) and ( 2 ) dust grains both in the ism and the iss are generally expected to be charged to a potential of a few volts @xcite .    in the solar reference frame ,",
    "solar motion relative to the ism induces an electric field @xmath25 , while the magnetic field strength stays essentially the same as in the ism frame .",
    "letting @xmath26 be the grain potential , the electric @xmath27 and magnetic @xmath28 forces on a grain are _",

    "clearly , the magnetic force can not be neglected compared with @xmath32 if the grain gets accelerated to a speed @xmath33 comparable to @xmath34 .",
    "in addition to electromagnetic forces , grains in orbit around the sun experience gas and coulomb drag due to the ism .",
    "since the mean free path of gas molecules and ions in the ism is much larger than @xmath35 , the drag force on a spherical grain under the assumption of sticking or specular reflection is given by @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the full ism pressure ( @xmath38 is the particle number density , @xmath39 is the temperature ) and @xmath40 is a dimensionless parameter , the value of which can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the full ism - related force acting on a particle is & = & * f_*+*f*_+*f * _ + & = & -_w + f _ [ eq : full ] + & = & s , [ eq : full_scaled ] where we defined parameters s & = & = 1.210 ^ -16  u_1 r_g,1 v_w,23b_5 , [ eq : s ] + c_d&=&=610 ^ -3 .",

    "thus , it is fair to approximate micron size particle motion as being affected only by electromagnetic and gravitational forces , which we do from now on .",
    "defining @xmath48 to be the angle between the magnetic field and the wind direction , @xmath49 , the strength of the induction electric force @xmath50 relative to the gravitational force @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the grain mass , @xmath53 is the distance from the sun ) is 50 r_3 ^ 2 u_1 r_g,1 ^ -2 b_5 v_w,23_1 ^ -1 _ wb . [ eq : eforce_rel ] here bulk density is @xmath54 , and we assume spherical particles : @xmath55 .",
    "a notable feature of the induction electric force @xmath56 is that its magnitude and direction are independent of either the grain s speed or its location with respect to the sun , provided that the magnetic field is homogeneous on scales comparable to the size of the solar system .    because @xmath57 while @xmath58 , the induction electric force exceeds solar gravity for particles smaller than some critical radius @xmath59 .",
    "grains with @xmath60 are swept up in the ism flow and ejected from the solar system .",
    "br10 show that an estimate of @xmath59 good to within about a factor of two can be obtained by setting @xmath61 , in which case we find ( neglecting the @xmath48-dependence ) [ rgmine ] r_g , & & r ( ) ^1/2 + & & 14   r_3 ( ) ^1/2 .    equations ( [ eq : eforce_rel])-([rgmine ] ) show that for @xmath0-size particles released at the initial distance @xmath62 au solar gravity is just a small perturbation initially , so that we can neglect @xmath63 compared with the electromagnetic forces @xmath56 and @xmath64 . then in the frame of the wind , a newly created ( e.g. in collisions of bigger grains ) particle moves with speed close to @xmath65 since the local keplerian velocity in the oss is v_k1  ^-1r_3 ^ -1/2v_w .",

    "[ eq : r_l ] this estimate shows that in the oss , @xmath0-size cometary grains can be easily entrained in the ism wind since their @xmath70 is smaller than the cloud size of @xmath71 au .",

    "taking advantage of better statistics , we use an angular resolution of @xmath221 for these plots to illustrate arrival directions of particles of different speeds .",
    "these projected direction plots illustrate that the arrival directions of bound particles are roughly uniform across the sky .",
    "marginally unbound particles with low positive approach energies ( low real approach velocities ) also have a relatively wide distribution of arrival directions .      finally , based on our simulations ,",
    "we illustrate how the measured particle velocity distributions can be used to infer basic properties of the oort cloud .",

    "the latter is used to obtain @xmath114 via equation ( [ eq : n ] ) , which then allows us to infer @xmath144 using equation ( [ eq : qr ] ) .",
    "the results of applying this procedure to the cases shown in figures [ e4 ] are demonstrated in figures [ r4 ] , using @xmath222 au and @xmath223 au , as before .",
    "the thin lines indicate the slope of the actual behavior of @xmath224 used as an input in simulations .",
    "one can see that the reconstructed @xmath224 is in very good agreement with the input behavior , which validates our procedure .",
    "not only are we able to reproduce the slope of @xmath224 quite well , irrespective of the value of @xmath48 , but we can also infer the existence of the break in the behavior of @xmath144 in the cases shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) figure [ r4 ] .",
    "one slight issue with our reconstruction procedure is that it yields particle production inward of the real input rim .",
    "this is very obvious for @xmath197 au , but it also occurs for @xmath196 au , as shown in panel ( a ) of figure [ r4 ] .",
    "we suspect this to be due to the initial velocity of particles at birth @xmath104 not being negligible compared with the velocity gain due to ism wind coupling .",
    "indeed , this problem arises mainly at small @xmath113 , which corresponds to particle approach velocities of @xmath225 km s@xmath4 and is more pronounced for small @xmath16 . for these grains , the non - zero initial velocity of order the local keplerian velocity makes a difference .",
    "neglecting it by adopting the cold limit as we do in our reconstruction procedure is likely to affect the reconstructed value of @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , we generally find that the measurement of the particle velocity distribution in the iss allows us to reconstruct the features of the radial dependence of @xmath144 as long as the statistics are sufficient .",
    "we now explore dust production in collisions between the oort cloud comets and make predictions for the dust flux that may be measured by space - borne missions .",

    "figure [ r85 ] shows that with a steep particle production profile , reconstructing the radial structure of the cloud far from @xmath16 is not realistic .",
    "only the innermost regions close to the inner edge can be probed , but over there , both the slope of @xmath144 and the location of @xmath16 are recovered quite reliably by our reconstruction procedure .",
    "our results show that cometary dust particles produced in the oss can be used as probes of the oort cloud s properties .",
    "current or near - future technology should allow their detection , provided that the cloud s properties are compatible with those used in evaluating particle flux in equation ( [ eq : fiss_full_est ] ) , i.e. a relatively close - in inner edge of the cloud @xmath324 au , cloud mass @xmath325 , and an erosion time at the inner edge @xmath326 comparable to the solar system age of @xmath327 gyr . in this case , one expects a space - borne experiment to detect a flux of @xmath2m - sized cometary particles of several m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 .",
    "dust detectors onboard _ galileo _ , _ ulysses _ , etc .",
    "have already been able to measure fluxes of @xmath0-sized grains moving at @xmath328 km s@xmath4 at the level of tens of m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , see table [ dust ] .",
    "thus , we expect the next generation of dust detectors @xcite to be able to measure the predicted cometary particle fluxes .",
    "observationally , these particles can hardly be confused with interplanetary or interstellar dust grains as the latter should be concentrated toward the ecliptic and the ism wind direction , correspondingly . at the same time , the cometary dust particles , even the relatively slow ones with @xmath209 km s@xmath4 , have a very distinct clustering of approach directions , orthogonal to the plane containing @xmath29 and @xmath68 , see  [ vel_dir ] .",
    "detection of the cometary grain population in the iss would strongly imply that the inner edge of the oort cloud lies at a relatively small separation , around @xmath177 au .",
    "this is not inconceivable given the existence of oss objects such as sedna @xcite , the orbit of which , given its large perihelion ( 76.4 au ) and relatively small semi - major axis ( 519 au ) , can hardly be explained in the framework of the standard picture of scattered kuiper belt object origins .",
    "if sedna is in fact a member of the inner extension of the oort cloud , then @xmath324 au should be possible .",
    "larger values of @xmath16 can make cometary grains produced in the oort cloud itself undetectable , given the strong dependence of the particle flux on @xmath16 , see equation ( [ eq : fiss_full ] ) .",
    "indeed , moving @xmath16 to 3,000 au would result in the reduction of @xmath329 by a factor of 80 , likely rendering cometary dust unobservable .",
    "our flux estimate ( [ eq : fiss_full ] ) also strongly relies on a very uncertain erosion time of the cloud .",
    "the best chances of seeing cometary dust are for @xmath245 similar to the solar system age .",
    "shorter @xmath245 means that the current cloud mass and dust production in it are reduced by collisional grinding compared with the original @xmath228 .",
    "longer @xmath245 lowers the mass flux in the collisional cascade , see equation ( [ eq : fiss_full ] ) .",
    "thus , a certain degree of fine - tuning of cloud properties is needed for @xmath329 to be measurable . on the other hand , our estimates of @xmath245 in appendix [ sect : erosion ] suggest that @xmath245 of order several gyr at @xmath330 au is plausible if comets are internally weak bodies , as they likely are .    as we showed in ",
    "[ sect : part_flux ] and  [ qdot ] , particle velocity distribution contains important information about both the cloud characteristics and the ism wind properties .",
    "the maximum velocity of the cometary grains is a direct measure of the wind velocity projected on the ism magnetic field direction , @xmath139 .",
    "it is important to note that cometary particle trajectories probe the _ global _ wind structure on large , @xmath205 au ( @xmath331 ) scales , as the effect of small - scale deviations from the uniform flow permeated by a homogeneous @xmath332-field on the particle motion likely averages out .",
    "the particle arrival direction peak gives the orientation of @xmath68 in the sky plane , perpendicular to @xmath29 .",
    "at the same time , the existing methods of inferring @xmath34 , @xmath332 and @xmath48 ( see references in table [ ismmodels ] ) probe only the _ local _ wind structure , since they rely on information gathered on heliospheric scales of order @xmath333 au .",
    "thus , cometary grains can give us access to the global view of the ism in the solar vicinity , and it should not be surprising if the inferred value of @xmath139 is different from the locally measured one .",
    "the slope of the grain velocity distribution carries information about the distribution of the dust production rate @xmath137 in the oss (  [ qdot ] ) .",
    "the latter , in turn , can be related to the most important underlying characteristics of the cloud  the spatial distribution of the cometary density , the total mass of the cloud , the location of its inner edge , and its erosion timescale , see equation ( [ eq : dotq1 ] ) .",
    "the latter characteristic is itself a function of the others and of the physical properties of comets ( their internal strength ) .",
    "needless to say , extracting all this information from the behavior of the particle velocity distribution requires a very well sampled @xmath114 , which will likely be very difficult , even with the next generation of dust detectors . as figure [ e85 ] clearly shows , probing the high-@xmath112 tail of @xmath114 , which provides information on @xmath139 , for realistic ( i.e. steeply declining with @xmath113 ) behaviors of @xmath144 would require detectors with very large collecting areas , given the low expected fluxes .",
    "even probing the low-@xmath112 slope of @xmath114 to infer @xmath144 in the inner cloud would require at least several @xmath334 detected particles , see figures [ e85 ] & [ r85 ] . if the overall grain flux @xmath329 turns out to be too low for the reasons described previously , this task will be infeasible .",
    "an added complication is that the interpretation of possible measurements of @xmath335 and velocity distribution suffers from a number of degeneracies , as equations ( [ eq : qr ] ) and ( [ eq : fiss_full ] ) demonstrate .",
    "for example , the derivation of @xmath144 via equation ( [ eq : qr ] ) depends on the assumed @xmath332-field strength , since both @xmath117 and @xmath70 in equation ( [ eq : r_0_2 ] ) depend on @xmath332 .",
    "overestimating @xmath332 by a factor of @xmath336 would result in underestimating all the linear scales , including @xmath16 , by a factor of @xmath336 , and overestimating @xmath137 by the same factor .",
    "the overall dust production rate in the cloud @xmath337 would be underestimated by @xmath338 . on the other hand",
    ", this particular degeneracy might be broken if one can accurately sample @xmath114 for particles of different sizes , as @xmath117 and @xmath70 are functions of @xmath35 , while the spatial distribution of @xmath137 is independent of particle size .",
    "a collisional cascade in the oort cloud can manifest itself not only via dust particles passing through the iss , but also small dust with sizes down to @xmath339 m can reveal itself via ( 1 ) back - scattering of solar light , ( 2 ) thermal radiation , and ( 3 ) gamma - ray emission produced in cosmic ray collisions with sub - meter - sized objects .",
    "we have verified that our cloud model motivated by the calculation of its collisional evolution and explored in ",
    "[ subsect : coll ] is not a strong contributor to the optical and near - ir sky background . for a cloud with mass @xmath340 and @xmath148 au , the scattered light intensity in the iss is about @xmath341 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath3 sr@xmath4 @xmath343 at @xmath344 m , even for a particle albedo of unity .",
    "this is about four orders of magnitude less than that produced by zodiacal dust , which is about @xmath345 ergs s@xmath4 cm@xmath3 sr@xmath4 @xmath343 at @xmath346 nm , see bernstein et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "the scattered light intensity varies roughly as @xmath347 and becomes comparable to the zodiacal light only for @xmath348 au .",
    "babich ( 2007 ) explored ways of constraining the oort cloud s properties using thermal emission from its small constituent particles .",
    "they have shown that a @xmath340 cloud with @xmath148 au is below the threshold of current cmb experiments meaning that our favored cloud model is undetectable via its own thermal radiation .",
    "moskalenko & porter ( 2009 ) investigated cosmic ray induced @xmath349-ray production in the oort cloud .",
    "they showed that the cloud becomes a noticeable contributor to the @xmath349-ray background only if its mass in objects with @xmath350 m ( most efficient at producing @xmath349-rays ) is @xmath351 for @xmath148 au ( this number varies as @xmath352 ) .",
    "the mass in objects of all sizes up to @xmath353 km would be @xmath354 times higher .",
    "our typical model with @xmath355 is far below this limit .",
    "we can thus conclude that other ways of directly probing the cloud properties explored in the literature can not reveal its presence if @xmath356 and @xmath357 au .",
    "direct detection of cometary dust particles originating in the oss may be our only hope for that .      according to figure [ esigma ] , some particles produced in collisions in the oort cloud have negative specific energy when passing through the iss , i.e. they are bound to the sun . inside the heliosphere",
    ", their orbits may be additionally affected by the electromagnetic effects of the solar wind .",
    "these particles would be contributing to the zodiacal dust population in the iss .",
    "thus , cometary collisions in the oss might provide a previously unrecognized source of the isotropic component of zodiacal dust .    in this work , we do not pursue a detailed assessment of the zodiacal dust production rate via this channel but merely mention some of its characteristics .",
    "first , bound dust particles are produced with non - zero efficiency only when the inner edge of the cloud lies close to the sun , see figures [ e4]a & [ esigma ] . as discussed in ",
    "[ vel_dist ] , for @xmath148 au and @xmath358 , bound particles passing between 3 - 10 au represent @xmath359 of the total number of grains created in the oort cloud ( about 1.7% of all particles passing through this annulus ) , while already for @xmath176 au , essentially all such grains are unbound .",
    "second , figure [ esigma ] shows that the number of bound particles is a strong function of their velocity dispersion at birth : for @xmath358 , the flux of bound particles is @xmath360 times higher than for @xmath361 .",
    "thus , properly accounting for the initial grain velocities is important for understanding the production of bound particles .",
    "even though bound particles represent only a small fraction of the dust generated in the oort cloud , the cloud mass may be sufficiently high for these grains to be a non - negligible contributor to the zodiacal dust population .",
    "we leave a detailed investigation of this issue to future work .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted the existence of a significant population of big , @xmath0-sized grains ( with a flux of tens of m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , see table [ dust ] ) , arriving in the general direction of the ism wind flow with speeds comparable to @xmath34 .",
    "the natural interpretation of such grains as being a part of the local ism is very problematic , as shown by @xcite .",
    "@xcite looked into an alternative origin of this population , namely cometary dust produced in the oort cloud . by placing the dust source as far as @xmath11 au away from the sun and assuming all big particles to have a cometary origin",
    ", they inferred a very short erosion timescale of the cloud , less than @xmath362 yr , which is unrealistic .",
    "for this reason @xcite dismissed a cometary origin for the @xmath0-sized interstellar dust particles .",
    "our results allow us to reassess this problem . explaining the flux of @xmath0-sized particles by cometary grains may in fact be marginally possible , contrary to the @xcite estimates .",
    "the main difference is that most of the cloud mass is likely concentrated much closer to the sun than the @xmath11 au adopted in that study .",
    "as our equation ( [ eq : fiss_full_est ] ) shows , this tremendously boosts the particle flux in the iss for the erosion timescale of order the solar system age .",
    "our more careful calculation of the particle flux in the iss presented in ",
    "[ sect : flux_iss ] still shows that @xmath329 falls short of explaining the flux of big interstellar particles by about an order of magnitude , but the discrepancy is not at the level of @xmath362 as in @xcite .    by exploring the particle _ delivery _ issue ,",
    "not addressed in @xcite ( they essentially assume that cometary dust couples effectively to the ism wind ) , we also show that particles get accelerated to speeds of order @xmath34 ( and even higher ) and are coupled to the ism flow on scales of order @xmath363 au .",
    "however , another problem emerges : we generically find that the majority of the cometary particles arrive to the iss in the direction _",
    "orthogonal _ to the ism wind direction , see  [ vel_dir ] .",
    "this is very hard to reconcile with observations .",
    "we have attempted to find the conditions under which cometary particles would arrive to the iss parallel to @xmath29 .",
    "this can be accomplished by increasing the curvature of the particle trajectory in the oort cloud , e.g. due to a stronger @xmath332-field and/or higher grain potential @xmath26 . in figure",
    "[ map5v85 ] , we show the distribution of particle arrival directions obtained for @xmath364 v and @xmath365 @xmath2 g ( so that @xmath366 is 10 times higher than our normal value ) and @xmath367 au . one can see that the locus of arrival directions gets displaced toward that of the interstellar wind .",
    "however , a brief look at equation ( [ eq : fiss_full_est ] ) demonstrates that for this choice of parameters , the particle flux is greatly reduced ( @xmath368 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ) and is much less than the value for big ism dust grains .",
    "similarly , figure [ e5v85 ] shows the velocity histograms for these simulations with stronger electric and magnetic fields .",
    "since particles are accelerated to high speeds by electromagnetic forces much more rapidly in these cases , the overall distribution is one of higher approach energies . in the @xmath196 au case ,",
    "observable fluxes of particles occur up to the velocity limit of @xmath111 but are generally quite low .",
    "thus , we find that simultaneously reconciling the observed flux and direction of fast @xmath0-sized grains with their possible cometary origin is very difficult .",
    "for that reason we also find it _",
    "unlikely _ that these big grains can be produced in cometary collisions in the oort cloud .",
    "on the other hand , we show that most of the @xmath369 m particles produced in the oort cloud are swept out of the solar system by the ism wind .",
    "depending on the lifetime of large , icy grains in the ism and the production rate of such grains around other stars , it may be possible for a global population of large grains to form in the ism from extrasolar cometary material .",
    "these interstellar grains would ultimately be coupled to the ism gas , making them a candidate for the observed population of large ism particles .",
    "we leave the investigation of this potential source of interstellar grains to future work .",
    "our analysis of cometary grain dynamics and their collisional origin has assumed a number of simplifications that we list below and that can be easily relaxed in the future .",
    "our calculation of the particle trajectories in both ",
    "[ sect : small_dyn ] and  [ numerical ] assumed that the ism properties are uniform on scales of @xmath370 au",
    ". this may not be the case if the local ism is turbulent on these scales .",
    "this can easily be accounted for by introducing a random component of @xmath68 and @xmath29 in our numerical calculations .",
    "however , we expect these effects to not be very important because of averaging on larger scales",
    ".    the grain potential @xmath26 should increase toward the sun .",
    "we have also neglected the influence of the solar wind on the grain motion inside the heliosphere .",
    "however , ( 1 ) this is going to be important only on scales @xmath371 au @xmath372 , and ( 2 ) the solar wind effect can be corrected for when the satellite measurements are made @xcite .",
    "given the uncertainties of the model , we do not feel that inclusion of these effects is justified .",
    "our flux calculation in ",
    "[ sect : dust_prod ] is very dependent on input parameters , as equation ( [ eq : fiss_full ] ) demonstrates .",
    "the biggest uncertainty , qualitatively affecting the results of this study , is the location of the inner edge of the cloud @xmath16 .",
    "related to that is our assumption of the spherically - symmetric oort cloud : galactic tides are likely to render its structure triaxial , and models suggest that it made be flattened in the inner regions @xcite",
    ". both of these effects could influence the dominant particle arrival direction and could introduce systematic errors into our iss particle flux calculations .",
    "the erosion timescale of the cloud at its inner edge is another poorly constrained parameter to which the particle flux calculation is very sensitive .",
    "its calculation involves not only knowing the local density of comets , but also understanding their internal properties , such as the collisional strength , see appendix [ sect : erosion ] .",
    "for this reason the value of @xmath245 is at present highly uncertain ( by @xmath373 orders of magnitude ) .",
    "finally , the cloud mass @xmath228 has been only weakly constrained by observations @xcite and is also a free parameter in our flux estimates , see  [ sect : dust_prod ] .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of probing the properties of the oort cloud via the direct detection of dust grains produced in collisions of comets in the oss .",
    "we explored both the production of cometary dust in the cloud and its delivery to the iss over the @xmath374 au scales under the influence of the electromagnetic forces produced by the magnetized interstellar wind .",
    "we present an analytic model of grain dynamics , which allows us to relate the details of dust production inside the oort cloud to measurable dust observables such as the velocity distribution of dust grains .",
    "we demonstrate that the latter can be used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the dust production profile in the oss and to infer important information about the ism wind properties on large scales , @xmath374 au , given good enough statistics .",
    "we show that cometary grains arrive to the iss predominantly in the direction orthogonal to both the ism wind speed @xmath29 and the ism @xmath68-field direction .",
    "the majority of these particles should have approach speeds of @xmath225 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these kinematic properties distinguish cometary grains from both interplanetary and interstellar dust grains .",
    "these predictions were successfully verified with direct numerical simulations of dust grain trajectories under the effect of the ism wind .",
    "we have also developed a simple model for the collisional evolution of the oort cloud and used it to compute the flux of cometary grains in the inner solar system .",
    "we predict a flux of several m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 for @xmath375 m particles for a cloud mass of @xmath376 m@xmath377 , inner edge @xmath378 au , and the erosion time at the inner edge @xmath379 gyr .",
    "we view the latter two parameters as the most uncertain inputs of our model . a significantly different value of @xmath326 or larger value of @xmath16 would likely make the cometary dust population undetectable .",
    "we also explore the possibility of explaining the recently detected population of big , @xmath0-sized grains entering the iss with the ism flow via their cometary origin . by combining the kinematic and flux constraints for the cometary grains",
    ", we find this explanation to be highly unlikely .",
    "based on our results , we claim that a possible detection of cometary dust grains entering the iss should provide us with an independent probe of the properties of both the oort cloud and the properties of the local ism , and we encourage efforts to build next - generation dust detectors for this purpose .",

    "particle motion was integrated with a 5th - order cash - karp runge - kutta method @xcite with adaptive step size control .",
    "the integration scheme was tested to integrate keplerian orbits accurately : after 30 dynamical timescales , the relative error in the perihelion position of highly elliptical orbits ( of most interest to us ) was measured to be no more 0.05% , and the relative error in perihelion velocity was @xmath380 .",
    "a particle was considered to have escaped from the solar system if it reached @xmath362 au ( @xmath381 pc ) from the sun .",
    "the particle was considered destroyed if it approached within @xmath382 from the center of the potential .",
    "this also prevented the step size from becoming unmanageably small .",
    "otherwise , the integration was continued for 30 dynamical times , and the particle was considered bound to the sun .    given that particles start with velocity @xmath103 , their subsequent motion is approximately perpendicular to the magnetic field direction , see  [ sect : small_dyn ] and equation ( [ eq : r_t ] ) .",
    "we use this property to speed up the simulation : instead of populating with particles the full spherical extent of the oort cloud , we do this only in a thick circular slab ( or short cylinder ) perpendicular to the @xmath332-field and passing through the sun .",
    "this rids us of the need to track the motion of particles at the oort cloud periphery , which never end up approaching the sun .",
    "we run several test simulations with different widths of the slab as well as with a spherical distribution of particles to confirm that our `` slab '' approach does not introduce any biases .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ mapslab ] , where we display the maps of the arrival directions of particles produced according to the procedure outlined in  [ vel_dir ] for different slab widths in a simulation with @xmath322 , @xmath148 au or @xmath10 au , and @xmath160 .",
    "one can see that the simulation with the 3,000 au wide slab reliably captures all the details of the particle arrival direction distribution , and we adopt this value in our work .    it should be noted that in our simulations , we always fix a total number of particles _ inside the slab _",

    "the minimum projectile mass @xmath391 is set by the condition @xmath395 , where @xmath396 is the specific energy needed for catastrophic disruption of a body of mass @xmath236 .",
    "we adopt the following behavior of @xmath397 as a function of object radius @xmath398 , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite for collisions at speeds not exceeding 1 km s@xmath4 : q_d^(d)=1.310 ^ 6 ( ) ^-0.4 + 0.08 ( ) ^1.3 ^ -1 .",
