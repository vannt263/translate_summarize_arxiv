    "much attention has been dedicated in recent years to the study of highly entangled phases of matter , such as spin liquids@xcite and fractional quantum hall systems@xcite , which are characterized not by symmetry properties , but rather by the pattern of long - range quantum entanglement in their ground state .",
    "( in the gapped case , long - range entanglement is usually referred to as ",
    "topological order\"@xcite . )",
    "one of the unifying features of such highly entangled phases of matter is their description in terms of gauge theories .",
    "these emergent gauge theories can arise in numerous different ways : as a means of imposing spin - ice rules , via flux attachment procedures , or via parton constructions , among others .",
    "no matter how they arise , gauge theories play a central role in our understanding of highly entangled phases .    until recently , attention was mostly focused on the familiar vector gauge fields , since little seemed to be gained by going to higher rank tensors . in three or fewer spatial dimensions , the  higher form \" gauge theories ( antisymmetric tensors ) are either unstable to confinement or",
    "provide dual formulations of vector gauge theories , and are not fundamentally new phases@xcite .",
    "the other case one might consider is that of  higher spin \" gauge theories ( symmetric tensors ) , which historically were notoriously difficult to formulate beyond the free field level . for many years , all consistent interacting theories basically fell into two classes : gravity ( the spin-2 case ) and variants of vasiliev theory , which involves an infinite tower of all possible higher spin fields@xcite .",
    "however , recent work has shown that it is actually possible to consistently formulate an interacting theory of any higher spin gauge field in @xmath0 dimensions , but that it requires the existence of particles restricted to motion along certain lower - dimensional subspaces@xcite .",
    "this same phenomenon of restricted mobility had earlier found concrete realization in a condensed matter setting , first in work due to chamon@xcite and several other models@xcite , including haah s code@xcite .",
    "these ideas were later more systematically developed in the vijay - haah - fu models@xcite . as a limiting case , some subdimensional particles",
    "are restricted to a 0-dimensional subspace and are totally immobile .",
    "these unconventional particles were given the name ",
    "fractons\"@xcite , a topic which has been particularly active recently@xcite .",
    "fractons find a natural setting in the language of higher spin gauge fields , with the  generalized lattice gauge theory \" introduced in reference @xcite serving as the discrete lattice analogue . in a sense ,",
    "the dual mysteries of fractons and higher spin gauge fields are two sides of the same coin .    for spin higher than 2",
    ", it seems plausible that we need some new physical ingredient , such as fractons , considering the apparent elusiveness of consistent theories .",
    "but it seems somewhat surprising that such exotic particles should arise even in a theory of rank 2 tensors , where we have a ( comparatively ) much better understanding , in the form of gravity .",
    "there are some differences in details between the rank 2 theories discussed in the condensed matter literature and conventional einstein gravity , but they are insufficient to explain the seemingly drastic difference in properties between fracton theories and gravitational theories .",
    "in fact , previously proposed emergent gravity models @xcite were secretly the first fracton models , though this escaped notice at the time .",
    "importantly , we will discuss how the key features which lead to fractonic behavior also exist in a gravitational theory , so we must set out to reconcile our understanding of these two phenomena .",
    "we will here do some of the basic work towards that goal by examining the simplest possible rank 2 fracton model in @xmath0 dimensions and elucidating how its properties can be understood in terms of emergent gravity .",
    "a concrete lattice model will be referenced , though the main conclusions will not be lattice dependent .",
    "the key feature which is shared between fracton models and gravity is the existence of extra conservation law(s ) , beyond the more familiar ones pertaining to energy , charge , and linear and angular momenta . in a fracton model , there are additional  higher moment \" conservation laws , which cause interplay between charge and position@xcite . when the conservation laws become strict enough , particle mobility becomes entirely disallowed , and the excitations become fractons .",
    "as we discuss in more detail below , the direct analogue in a gravitational theory is the conservation of center of mass in the system s rest frame , which in an appropriate sense is the noether charge associated with boost symmetry .",
    "this conservation law seems almost trivial , and it is often taken for granted since , at the classical level , it follows immediately from conservation of momentum .",
    "but at the quantum level , in the presence of a preferred center of mass , single - particle momenta are no longer good quantum numbers for a gravitational system . in a quantum gravity theory ,",
    "center of mass conservation becomes a law with a life of its own .",
    "in fact , we will discuss how this conservation law and the principle of locality lead immediately to gravitational attraction .    in order for a particle to move",
    ", it must exchange center of mass information with the rest of the universe , so as to conserve the total center of mass of the system . in the fracton model we will consider",
    ", we can see this happen directly . for a fracton to hop ,",
    "it must emit or absorb a freely propagating bound state carrying the emergent  center of mass \" quantum number , which exchanges information with the rest of the system .",
    "some limited fracton mobility can occur through the exchange of virtual bound states between two fractons .",
    "the amplitude for such hopping processes will be proportional to the propagation amplitude of the bound state between them , which decays to zero at large separation .",
    "the propagation speed of fractons therefore drops as the separation increases , amounting to an effective attraction between them , which we will show plays the role of gravity . at large separation ,",
    "the propagator has decayed to zero , indicating that the particles can no longer exchange any significant amount of center of mass information . at this point ,",
    "the hopping matrix elements go to zero and the particles become immobile , recovering fractonic behavior .",
    "so if an isolated particle has no mobility , how does a normal gravitational particle move around our universe so well ?",
    "the answer is that this particle is not truly isolated , but rather exists in a universe filled with a large - scale distribution of similar matter particles .",
    "this distribution of matter effectively acts as a bath for the exchange of center of mass",
    ". we will see in our toy model that a particle s hopping matrix elements , and therefore its inertial mass , are directly determined by the distribution of other matter particles present .",
    "we therefore have an explicit manifestation of mach s principle : the inertia of a particle is not intrinsic to the body itself , but rather is given to the particle by its interaction with the  distant stars \" of its emergent universe@xcite ( though nearby matter provides a proportionally greater contribution to the inertia , as expected by locality ) . in this sense , the immobility of isolated fractons in a rank 2 theory is a direct consequence of mach s principle : these fractons do not have any  universe \" to move against .",
    "we will analyze the details of the two - body problem to see the effective attraction explicitly , showing that it matches up with the expected properties of the gravitational force .",
    "we discuss the conditions necessary to recover the newtonian limit , finding that we need gapless particles carrying the emergent center of mass quantum number .",
    "this condition is automatically satisfied in a nonlinear gravity model , where the graviton acts as a gravitational source .",
    "we will also relate our treatment of motion to the traditional geodesic formulation , deriving the appropriate analogue within our toy model .",
    "our formulation of the geodesic principle leads us to the interesting conclusion that matter is responsible not only for creating perturbations to some existing background metric , but also in generating the background metric itself . when there are no particles present , space is pulled apart into a set of independent isolated points .",
    "it is only in the presence of matter that these points coalesce into a smooth geometry .    for the uncomfortable high energy reader",
    ", we also include an appendix discussing the ways in which the present work circumvents the weinberg - witten no - go theorem on this type of emergent gravity model .",
    "we will consider here a model which was studied in detail in earlier work , where it played the role of the simplest gapless fracton model @xcite .",
    "we will keep the present treatment self - contained , but we refer the reader to the older sources for a more in - depth analysis of certain details . in this work , we will show that the model serves as a simplified toy version of emergent gravity .",
    "we explain the fractonic behavior first , discussing the relationship with einstein gravity in the next section .",
    "we focus on the lattice - independent concepts in the main text , while the specific lattice implementation is described in appendix a.    we take our fundamental degrees of freedom to be those of a rank 2 symmetric tensor field @xmath1 existing throughout a three - dimensional space . (",
    "all indices are spatial . )",
    "this tensor has a canonical conjugate variable @xmath2 which is also a symmetric tensor .",
    "the symbols @xmath3 and @xmath4 are chosen intentionally to make connection with the vector potential and electric field of electromagnetism , which are canonical conjugates . as emphasized in previous work ,",
    "the primary factor controlling the properties of a gauge theory is the generalized gauss s law , which defines the gauge symmetry and thereby determines the rest of the theory . for the model we will consider here ,",
    "the defining gauss s law takes the form : @xmath5 where repeated indices are summed over .",
    "( the use of  upper \" and  lower \" indices is purely for bookkeeping purposes . raising and lowering",
    "is done with the flat metric @xmath6 . )",
    "the quantity @xmath7 represents an emergent scalar charge .",
    "we will see in the next section that this equation is a proxy for the @xmath8 component of the linearized einstein equations , and @xmath7 is analogous to the emergent energy , @xmath9 . for simplicity ,",
    "we allow our gauge field @xmath10 to be compact , so that this charge is quantized .",
    "( some details regarding compactness can be found in appendix a. ) equation [ gauss ] can actually be regarded as the _ definition _ of charge in this model , in the same way that gauss s law can be regarded as the definition of charge in a conventional @xmath11 maxwell theory @xcite . in the ground state , which is free of charges , we have the constraint @xmath12 . in turn , this constraint implies a gauge symmetry under the transformation : @xmath13 for gauge parameter @xmath14 with arbitrary spatial dependence .",
    "this gauge symmetry protects the gaplessness of propagating gauge degrees of freedom , which provide an emergent graviton",
    ". modes . these could be eliminated by more complicated gauge constraints , if so desired , but their presence will not affect any of our arguments , so we stick with the simplest theory . ] keeping only the most relevant gauge - invariant terms , the hamiltonian governing the gapless gauge modes takes the quasi - electromagnetic form : @xmath15 where the integral is over three - dimensional space , and @xmath16 is an appropriately defined gauge - invariant  magnetic \" tensor , which leads to a linear graviton dispersion . from this hamiltonian",
    ", we can derive generalized tensor maxwell equations which will serve as the toy einstein equations for this model .",
    "but as we will discuss , almost all of the important physics of gravitation follows directly from equation [ gauss ] , which is the analogue of the @xmath9 component of the einstein equations .",
    "the full set of einstein equations can be found in appendix a. the precise details of the hamiltonian and the corresponding gauge field dynamics will not be of much concern to us here .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix a for more precise lattice details and to @xcite for a more detailed account of the generalized electromagnetism of this phase .    while the gapless gauge sector obeys @xmath12 , we can also have excited states violating this constraint , corresponding to the presence of charges , via equation [ gauss ] .",
    "this generalized gauss s law immediately allows us to identify the conservation laws of the system .",
    "for example , we have a conservation of total charge , just as in ordinary electromagnetism .",
    "the total charge can be written as : @xmath17 where the integrals are over the three dimensions of space .",
    "we are integrating a total derivative , which gives us a boundary term .",
    "in particular , if we focus on a closed manifold , the total charge must be zero .",
    "either way , the physical conclusion is the same : charge is always conserved in the bulk .",
    "no local operator in the bulk of the system can change the total charge .",
    "any operator that creates charged particles must create an equal number of positive and negative charges .",
    "the total charge of the system can only change if charges flow in or out through the boundary .",
    "charge conservation should be fairly familiar .",
    "but we can use similar logic to identify a sneakier conservation law in this system .",
    "consider the total dipole moment of charges in the system : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spatial coordinate and ",
    "\" denotes a boundary term .",
    "we integrated by parts in the middle step , then integrated the total derivative . at the end of the day",
    ", we once again end up with only a boundary term .",
    "we see that the total dipole moment also has a conservation law , changing only when charges enter or leave the system through the boundary .",
    "in addition to respecting charge conservation , any local operator in the bulk must also respect dipole moment conservation .",
    "this conservation law immediately puts some severe restrictions on the sorts of local operators which can occur .",
    "no operator can create particles in a dipole configuration , such as in figure [ fig : dipole ] , since this is in violation of the conservation of the global dipole moment .",
    "since such dipole creation operators also serve as particle hopping operators ( lowering the charge at one site and increasing it at the next ) , we see that the conservation laws rule out traditional particle mobility , making these fractonic excitations .",
    "the only allowable particle creation operators are those which create particles in purely quadrupolar configurations , such as those seen in figures [ fig : quadrupole1 ] and [ fig : quadrupole2 ] .",
    "such operators can  hop \" a particle , but only at the expense of creating additional particles , which is energetically unfavorable .",
    "a fracton would need to constantly absorb or emit other particles at each step of its motion to continue hopping , as opposed to normal particles which can propagate freely all by themselves .",
    "while a charged particle is fractonic , neutral bound states of such fractons can actually be mobile . in particular , consider a dipolar bound state , consisting of a positive charge and a negative charge .",
    "note that , despite its neutrality , this is not a  trivial \" excitation , as it can not be locally created from the vacuum due to the dipole conservation law . due to its neutrality , such a bound state is free to move around the system , though it is forced to maintain a fixed dipole moment .",
    "in fact , the quadrupolar operators of figures [ fig : quadrupole1 ] and [ fig : quadrupole2 ] are exactly the hopping matrix elements for such mobile dipoles . the square quadrupole of figure [ fig : quadrupole1 ] corresponds to a transverse hopping operator , while the linear quadrupole of figure [ fig : quadrupole2 ] corresponds to the longitudinal hopping operator .",
    "the preceding model is certainly interesting , but what does it have to do with gravity ?",
    "well , one of the original motivations for writing down such tensor gauge theories was the fact that gravity is also described by a symmetric tensor , in the form of the metric @xmath20",
    ". for simplicity , let us only consider linearized gravity , where we write the metric in the form @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the minkowski metric and @xmath23 being a small perturbation .",
    "the action for linearized einstein gravity is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath24 , which is a descendant of diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "components with a time index , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , have non - dynamical equations of motion , acting as lagrange multipliers to enforce gauge constraints , in the same way that @xmath27 acts as a lagrange multiplier enforcing gauss s law in maxwell theory@xcite .",
    "the remaining physical degrees of freedom are those of a spatial symmetric tensor @xmath28 .",
    "we call its canonical conjugate @xmath29 . for linearized einstein gravity",
    ", one can show that the gauge constraints on these variables are given by : @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the stress - energy tensor .",
    "these are essentially just the @xmath33 and @xmath8 components of the einstein equations .",
    "( we have absorbed numerical constants and the gravitational coupling into @xmath32 for simplicity . )",
    "the corresponding gauge symmetries are : @xmath34 @xmath35 for parameters @xmath36 and @xmath14 with arbitrary spatial dependence .",
    "note that there are constraints and gauge symmetries on both the field @xmath28 and its conjugate @xmath29 , so the choice of calling @xmath28 the  gauge field \" is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "equation [ gravmom ] corresponds to a spatial vector charge representing an emergent momentum , while equation [ gravgauss ] has a spatial scalar charge representing the emergent energy .",
    "it is this second equation which is analogous to the gauss s law used in our toy model , @xmath37 .",
    "we have opted for a toy model with a simplified gauss s law , as opposed to working directly with the full gauge constraints of linearized einstein gravity , so as to isolate the essential ingredient required for gravitation , which turns out to be a conservation law which is shared between the two theories .",
    "the equation @xmath37 can be regarded as the minimal constraint which produces gravitational behavior .",
    "the presence of two terms on the left side of equation [ gravgauss ] makes it superficially look more complicated than our toy gauss s law , but having two derivatives allows us to immediately prove the exact same conservation law : @xmath38 corresponding to conservation of center of mass in the rest frame . in a sense , this corresponds to the conserved noether charge of boost symmetry .",
    "the generator of a boost in the @xmath39 direction takes the form @xmath40 , which depends explicitly on time , unlike more familiar symmetry generators .",
    "nevertheless , we can still find a conservation law .",
    "energy eigenstates can be chosen to also be eigenstates of boosts , so we have : @xmath41 on our eigenstates .",
    "this simply implies that the center of mass is moving at a constant velocity , determined by the total momentum of the system .",
    "however , we are free to pick the reference frame in which the total momentum of the system is zero , and the center of mass is at rest . since the total momentum of the system is conserved , the center of mass will stay stationary in this frame at all times , or in other words , it obeys a conservation law .",
    "we now have an alternative interpretation of the dipole conservation law , @xmath42 = constant , in our toy model .",
    "if we simply regard @xmath7 as a mass density , positive for particles and negative for antiparticles , we can rephrase dipole moment conservation as  center of mass \" conservation of the emergent mass .",
    "since this conservation law led directly to fractonic behavior , we should somehow be able to reconcile our understanding of fractons with the consequences of center of mass conservation in a gravitational theory",
    ". this will be the primary task of this paper .",
    "of course , our toy model is not a full match for einstein gravity , which has a more complicated gauss s law , with both scalar and vector charges .",
    "our toy model only has an emergent  energy , \" whereas a full gravitational theory would have both emergent energy and momentum , leading to an emergent lorentz invariance .",
    "( it seems that such an emergent momentum will fit naturally into the work of gu and wen@xcite , though the details will need to be carefully studied . ) also , the details of the low - energy hamiltonian for the gauge mode in our toy model are different from einstein gravity .",
    "the graviton dispersion in the toy model is still linear , but we have extra gapless gauge modes with no analogue in einstein gravity .",
    "nevertheless , this difference is confined to the gauge mode sector and does not affect fractonic behavior , which is our main concern in the present work .",
    "we focus here on the dynamics of the fractons , which appear to be insensitive to such differences .",
    "we will find that our simplified toy model is sufficient to capture most of the important physics of gravity .",
    "now that we understand our higher moment conservation law as center of mass conservation , one might be tempted to think that fractons are nt so fractonic after all . given two fractons of equal charge , why not just consider a state where they move in opposite directions at the same speed ?",
    "such a state is certainly consistent with the center of mass conservation law .",
    "however , it will turn out to not be an eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "two fractons of equal charge have a definite center of mass , and the effective hamiltonian for a fracton will depend on its distance from this center of mass .",
    "while we still possess overall translation invariance of the system , we do not have translation invariance for an individual particle , and single - particle momentum is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "instead , we must work directly in position space .",
    "to begin , we will analyze the case of two particles of equal charge , as shown in figure [ fig:2part ] .",
    "as illustrated , one of the fractons can move , but only at the expense of creating a dipole ( a particle - antiparticle pair ) which is mobile and can propagate to the other fracton . if the second fracton absorbs this dipole , it will hop an equal distance in the opposite direction as the first fracton . in this way , the center of mass of the system is unchanged .",
    "it is important to note that this all actually occurs as a virtual process .",
    "the system does not have the extra energy or momentum required to create a real on - shell dipole to exchange between the fractons .",
    "nevertheless , such processes can ( and do ) occur at the virtual level .",
    "the amplitude for such a hop , call it @xmath43 , will depend on several things , including the dipole mass and the amplitudes for emission and absorption of the dipole .",
    "but most notably , @xmath43 will be proportional to the propagator of the mobile dipole between the two fractons .",
    "suppose we write @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the creation and annihilation operators of a dipole at location @xmath46 , and let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be the locations of the two fractons .",
    "the spatial dependence of the hopping amplitude @xmath43 is given by : @xmath49 where we have defined @xmath50 as a shorthand for the real - space equal - time propagator , @xmath46 is the distance between the two fractons , and @xmath14 is some constant . by the overall translation invariance of the system ,",
    "this propagator still only depends on @xmath51 .",
    "note that there are no concerns regarding causality .",
    "the nonzero nature of the propagator at well - separated points is quite standard .",
    "correlation does not imply causation .",
    "the dipole propagator , and therefore the hopping matrix elements , will approach zero at large distances . for",
    "the case where the dipoles have some finite energy gap @xmath52 , hopping elements behave as @xmath53 . when the particles are separated by more than a few times @xmath54 , the hopping matrix elements are essentially zero , and fractonic behavior is very quickly recovered . or",
    ", when we have gapless dipoles , @xmath55 falls off as a power law , which is an important case that we will discuss later .",
    "( actually , @xmath55 deviates slightly from @xmath56 in the gapless case , as we will discuss . )",
    "either way , the resulting hopping elements @xmath55 decay as the fractons become separated .",
    "this means that the velocity of the fractons gets smaller as they move apart .",
    "this is the same effect as an attraction between the two particles .",
    "in fact , we will see later how to recover the inverse square attraction of the newtonian limit .",
    "but note that the normal logic of attraction is somewhat turned on its head .",
    "we normally think of the motion of the particle as intrinsic to the body , and other particles simply influence this motion by means of various forces . in the present case ,",
    "motion is inherently a cooperative effect , driven by the interaction between particles .",
    "as the fractons approach each other , they are not speeding up through the exertion of a  force \" per se , but rather are jointly increasing each other s mobility through a more rapid virtual exchange of center of mass information .",
    "one can not start from momentum eigenstates and use perturbation theory to analyze changes in motion .",
    "rather , one must start with position eigenstates and perturb in the motion itself .    in a sense",
    ", this gravitational attraction is inevitable , due to locality and the conservation of center of mass . whenever a particle moves , it is changing its own contribution to the total center of mass of the system .",
    "since the total center of mass must remain exactly conserved at all times , the rest of the universe must respond in unison by moving in the opposite direction .",
    "when there are other particles nearby , the exchange of center of mass information can occur rapidly .",
    "but when the fracton is well - separated from other matter , the locality of the interactions prevents the efficient exchange of center of mass information between the involved parties , leading to a slowdown of the motion .",
    "note that a non - gravitational theory with center of mass conservation is mildly fine - tuned in this sense .",
    "for example , in a standard free field theory , the eigenstates are described in terms of the momentum basis , not position .",
    "such a state is not in a center of mass eigenstate , but rather is a superposition of all possible locations of the center of mass .",
    "the system does not have a definite center of mass for particles to be attracted towards , which is why there is on average no gravitational force .",
    "nevertheless , any realistic collection of particles created in the lab has a definite center of mass , breaking the single - particle translation invariance .",
    "the situation is similar to the theory of superconductivity , where one has to choose between working with eigenstates of particle number or eigenstates of phase .",
    "the particle number basis is more familiar , but it tends to mask the important physics , since the superconducting order parameter vanishes in any particle number eigenstate . only in the phase basis",
    "is it clear that superconductivity is a fairly ubiquitous phenomenon at low temperatures .",
    "we face a similar choice between momentum and position eigenstates in a quantum gravity theory .",
    "the momentum basis tends to be more familiar , building on intuition from free field theory , but the position basis leads to a much clearer understanding of the origin of gravity .",
    "we have argued above that the hopping matrix elements of a particle fall off to zero as a particle becomes separated from all other particles in the system . in other words ,",
    "its effective mass becomes infinite .",
    "nevertheless , we see particles moving around all the time in our everyday life , with a seemingly finite mass , @xmath57 finite hopping matrix elements",
    ". how can this be ? in order for a particle to move at constant speed , it must have some bath with which it can constantly exchange center of mass information .",
    "let us examine some possible sources of such a center of mass bath .",
    "naively , one candidate might be a condensate of the mobile dipoles , which carry the center of mass quantum number .",
    "indeed , we found that the hopping elements are proportional to @xmath56 , the dipole propagator .",
    "if the dipoles condensed , we would have a nonzero limit of @xmath56 as @xmath46 approached infinity , giving the fractons a finite mass .",
    "the problem with this scenario is that dipole condensation also destroys the phase entirely . as shown in previous work@xcite , a dipole @xmath58 couples to the gauge field via minimal coupling to the effective gauge field @xmath59",
    ". assuming dipole condensation occurs independently of orientation , dipole condensation is enough to gap all components of the gauge field , destroy long - range entanglement , and take us to a trivial phase .",
    "another thought is to go to finite temperature , where we should have a thermal bath of dipoles which can be absorbed to allow fracton mobility . indeed , at temperatures comparable to the mass scale of dipoles , thermally",
    "excited dipoles can play a role in fracton mobility .",
    "we leave the discussion of such finite - temperature physics to a future work .",
    "but there is a simpler mechanism for fracton mobility which does not require a thermal ensemble or a condensate .",
    "a fracton will be endowed with finite mobility simply by the presence of a finite density distribution of other fractons .",
    "if space is filled with some finite density @xmath60 of fractons , then a given fracton will always have particles around with which it can exchange center of mass information .",
    "the hopping matrix elements can in fact be directly calculated by summing the amplitudes for absorbing dipoles emitted from each point in space : @xmath61 in the case where @xmath60 is approximately constant , we can pull it out of the integral to obtain : @xmath62 where we have taken advantage of the normalization and translation invariance of @xmath50 to show that the hopping element @xmath43 is now independent of @xmath46 .",
    "the fracton now has a finite and constant effective mass at any point in the universe , which is in line with the normal behavior of our reality .",
    "the most notable feature of the above formulas is the fact that they provide a concrete realization of mach s principle , a quasi - philosophical concept which historically has been difficult to put on firm footing . loosely speaking , this principle states",
    "that inertia is not an intrinsic property of a body , but rather is given to the body by its interaction with the rest of the universe ( often poetically phrased as  the distant stars \" ) .",
    "the concept was influential to einstein in the original development of general relativity .",
    "the standard formulation of einstein gravity already obeys this principle in a sense , in that the large - scale distribution of matter of the universe determines its curvature , which then determines the geodesics which matter must follow .",
    "the present treatment from the fractonic viewpoint is not at odds with general relativity .",
    "rather , it provides a reformulation which is more explicitly machian , showing that inertial mass is not an intrinsic constant , but determined by interactions with the rest of the universe",
    ". in particular , equation [ mach1 ] explicitly shows that inertia depends on the distribution of mass throughout all of space ( though the propagator puts heavier weighting on nearby regions ) .",
    "considering the toy nature of the model described here , we will refrain from too much cosmological speculation , aside from a few basic remarks .",
    "let us assume that our formulation of mach s principle applies to real - world gravity .",
    "at the current point in cosmological history , the effects would not be particularly noticeable .",
    "any gravitational source can generate mass for particles , and cosmological data suggests that the primary source of energy density in the present era is dark energy , which remains constant over time .",
    "thus , the present - day inertia of particles would be set by the dark energy content of the universe , and there would be no observed change in the inertia of particles over time .",
    "however , things could be much different in the matter or radiation dominated eras of cosmology , when the energy density of the universe evolved as a function of time . at earlier times , the universe was much denser , which leads to particles having less inertial mass .",
    "particles should therefore experience much greater acceleration in the early universe .",
    "whether or not this has any significant cosmological implications is unclear at the present time .",
    "we will now analyze the classical limit of the two - body problem for this toy model , to see the gravitational attraction more explicitly . as we will show , when the mobile dipoles are gapped excitations , the gravity will be short - ranged .",
    "a power law gravitational attraction requires the dipoles to be _",
    "gapless_. for the linearized toy model discussed here , this requires either fine - tuning or some form of symmetry protection , but we will discuss why such gaplessness is natural in a more accurate nonlinear theory of quantum gravity .",
    "we analyze the problem of two fractons of equal charge , moving via the exchange of virtual dipoles .",
    "these two fractons will orbit each other around their mutual center of mass .",
    "the hopping matrix elements are non - uniform , taking the form @xmath63 where @xmath56 is the dipole propagator , @xmath46 is the separation of the fractons , and @xmath14 is a constant .",
    "we note that it is not necessary to keep track of the positions of the two particles separately .",
    "since center of mass is always conserved , we only need to specify the position of one particle , while the other particle always stays in step on the opposite side of the center of mass .",
    "we therefore only need to analyze an effectively single - particle problem with non - uniform hopping matrix elements .    for a system of free particles on a lattice with uniform hopping matrix elements @xmath43 and on - site energy @xmath64",
    "( the bare energy of a particle ) , the low - energy continuum limit of the single - particle dispersion generically takes the quadratic form : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the lattice scale and @xmath67 is the momentum .",
    "( the factor of @xmath68 is non - universal and is simply chosen for convenience . )",
    "the hopping element @xmath43 represents the inverse effective mass .",
    "since we wish to investigate the classical limit , we will now let the effective mass depend on position , and let the momentum vary as an independent classical variable .",
    "this is spiritually equivalent to a wkb approximation , where we allow the momentum @xmath67 to vary with position .",
    "this is only a rough approximation , but we will see that it is enough to get a sensible physical picture and recover the expected classical behavior of gravity . within this approximation ( and setting @xmath69 ) the energy equation takes the form : @xmath70 where we have allowed for the possibility of a potential energy between the particles , @xmath71 , which is usually present in gapless fracton models .",
    "one should also generically allow for tensor structure in the kinetic term , @xmath72 , to allow for different hopping amplitudes in the radial and tangential directions .",
    "we ignore this tensor structure for now , in order to focus on scaling , but we will comment on tensor structure later . rearranging equation",
    "[ disperse ] , we have : @xmath73 we now have an equation describing a particle of unit mass moving in an effective potential given by @xmath74 , at a fixed energy .",
    "let us first consider the case where there is no intrinsic interparticle potential , @xmath75 , as would be the case in a gapped fracton model .",
    "this will allow us to focus on the physics which is intrinsic to fractons , without worrying about the specifics of the gauge field .",
    "we note that , for particles near the bottom of the dispersion , we have @xmath76 , so the effective potential @xmath77 is positive . since @xmath55 decreases as @xmath46 increases , we know that the magnitude of the potential increases at large radius .",
    "these two facts immediately tell us that the effective potential is attractive .",
    "there are two important cases to consider .",
    "first , suppose that the dipoles are gapped , with some energy gap @xmath52 , which at first glance appears to be the generic situation . in this case",
    ", we have exponential decay of the matrix elements , @xmath78 ( for some constant @xmath79 ) , so the effective potential @xmath80 grows exponentially . to find the orbital momentum , we write : @xmath81 @xmath82 we must also find the appropriate value of @xmath83 for an orbit at radius @xmath46 .",
    "( the radius of a specific orbit is set by @xmath83 in equation [ effect ] , since the effective energy is fixed at 1 . )",
    "we can find the correct value by plugging the orbital momentum back into equation [ effect ] ( with zero external potential ) : @xmath84 @xmath85 using this value in our orbital momentum , we obtain : @xmath86 we have an orbital momentum which asymptotes to a constant at large @xmath46 .",
    "however , the physically relevant measure of orbital motion is actually the _ velocity _ of the particle , @xmath87 , which behaves as : @xmath88 the orbital speed decays to zero exponentially as the fractons separate .",
    "when the fractons are separated by more than a few times @xmath54 , motion is completely negligible , as we expect for fractons .",
    "that is , of course , unless we have a finite background density of fractons .",
    "when we have a finite background hopping element , @xmath89 , the effective potential then behaves as : @xmath90 this potential has the same attractive exponential form at short distances , but it asymptotes to a constant at long distances , indicating a finite depth to the potential well .",
    "this allows for the possibility of the particles escaping each other s gravitational wells and behaving as free particles at infinity .",
    "the exponential dropoff of motion seen above seems in line with the expected behavior of fractons , but it is certainly not in line with the expected behavior of gravity in our world , where the gravitational force is a power law .",
    "this leads us to consider an alternative case , where the dipoles mediating the motion are gapless . in the presence of gapless dipoles , the hopping matrix elements @xmath55 should behave as a power law",
    "however , the calculation is more subtle in this case .",
    "the hopping still occurs via the exchange of center of mass , but more possibilities exist beyond the straightforward propagation of a fixed dipole .",
    "for example , a virtual bound state can change its dipole moment via the emission of a second dipole , as seen in figure [ fig : split ] .",
    "even more complicated multi - body processes are possible . when the dipoles are gapless , these processes are comparable in weight to single - dipole propagation and must be taken into account .",
    "we can no longer simply sum over paths of a single dipole , but rather must sum over a set of complicated branched networks .",
    "since there are many more possible processes contributing to motion , we expect that the hopping element @xmath55 will be larger than the naive propagator @xmath56 of a normal gapless particle .",
    "indeed , we will argue that @xmath55 behaves as @xmath91 , as opposed to the @xmath92 behavior of the propagator @xmath56 for a gapless scalar .",
    "it is unclear how to directly perform the necessary sum over networks , and we will not construct a systematic framework here , but rather will make a heuristic argument for the scaling .",
    "these branched network structures correspond to the generalized  field lines \" of the electric tensor @xmath93 , @xmath57 configurations obeying @xmath12 away from the charges .",
    "in fact , this phase corresponds to a condensate of networks , in the same way that a conventional @xmath11 spin liquid corresponds to a condensate of its emergent electric field lines . to get the hopping element @xmath55",
    ", we need to count the electric field lines starting at the location of one fracton and passing through the location of the other , which is equivalent to finding the average electric tensor felt by a particle due to the other .",
    "we therefore should have : @xmath94 using the fact that the electric tensor for a point charge scales as @xmath91 in this model @xcite , just as the linearized metric @xmath28 falls off as @xmath91 in the vicinity of a point mass in einstein gravity .",
    "we conjecture that the more precise relationship @xmath95 probably holds .",
    "this is , of course , a very heuristic derivation , which should be backed up by more concrete calculations once the necessary techniques have been developed .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that this behavior is precisely what is needed both to recover the newtonian limit and to connect with the geodesic principle , as we will see shortly .",
    "we have argued that , when dipoles are gapless , hopping matrix elements behave as @xmath96 for some constant @xmath79 .",
    "let us work directly with the generic case of a finite background density , so that @xmath97 .",
    "the effective potential in this case would be : @xmath98 the orbital momentum corresponding to this potential is : @xmath99 so the orbital velocity simply behaves as @xmath100 .",
    "once again , we must find the appropriate value of @xmath83 , which can be found by plugging back into equation [ effect ] : @xmath101 @xmath102 using this value , we find the following orbital velocity : @xmath103 at large @xmath46 , the hopping element @xmath55 goes to the background value @xmath104 , giving us the asymptotic behavior : @xmath105 we therefore see that the long - distance behavior of the velocity profile scales precisely as expected from the inverse square law of the newtonian limit . recovering",
    "this behavior is comforting and gives us some confidence in the approximations that have been made .",
    "note that , if @xmath104 were zero , we would actually end up with @xmath91 behavior for the velocity .",
    "the presence of the finite density background is actually crucial for recovering the newtonian limit .",
    "the above analysis has indicated that obtaining the newtonian limit requires gapless dipoles , whereas the gapped case leads only to short - ranged attraction .",
    "how are we to make sense of this ?",
    "since power - law gravity requires gapless dipoles , there must be some mechanism which enforces this behavior in a real gravity model , without relying on fine - tuning .",
    "one might consider some form of symmetry protection which could keep the dipole dispersion gapless , but this is a rather unattractive feature .",
    "one of the end goals of emergent gravity is the emergence of spacetime itself .",
    "it would seem odd if the stability of newtonian gravity relied on a symmetry of some embedding spacetime .",
    "luckily , the full nonlinear version of einstein gravity nicely circumvents this problem .",
    "the nonlinearity implies that the graviton itself also acts as a source for the gravitational field . in other words",
    ", the graviton also carries the center of mass quantum number .",
    "the gaplessness of the graviton is protected by the gauge symmetry of the theory , providing a natural source of gapless dipoles which can be exchanged between particles .",
    "this feature is absent in the linearized gravity theory considered here , but in a more complete theory of quantum gravity , nonlinearity and gauge invariance combine to guarantee the existence of gapless dipoles which will mediate an effective inverse square force .",
    "so far , we have only considered the intrinsic attraction between fractons arising from the exchange of dipoles . for gapped fracton models ,",
    "this story is fairly complete , and we can unambiguously say that such fractons will attract each other .",
    "but , as mentioned earlier , for gapless fracton models one must also typically include an  electromagnetic \" potential arising from the behavior of the gapless gauge field , which may or may not modify the story in certain regimes , depending on the form of the potential . for example , in the toy model we have discussed here , the gauge potential between two identical fractons is repulsive , taking the form @xmath106 for constant @xmath107@xcite . adding this potential to the intrinsic effective potential gives us @xmath108 . at short distances ,",
    "the linear term is negligible , and we maintain an attractive interaction . at long distances , however , the linear term is dominant , and we obtain a repulsive potential , destabilizing any circular orbits",
    ".    this feature will not survive in a more faithful representation of standard einstein gravity .",
    "the gauge potential between like charges is repulsive on very general grounds .",
    "however , from the hamiltonian formulation of linearized einstein gravity@xcite , we have by scaling that the repulsive gauge potential must behave as @xmath109 .",
    "it is easy to check that a small @xmath91 term does not result in long - distance repulsion , but simply changes the orbital velocity .",
    "thus , the long - distance repulsion of the toy model is not shared by einstein gravity . whether this is a bug or a feature of the toy model depends on one s point of view . from the point of view of trying to reproduce einstein s equations exactly , this repulsion is an unattractive defect .",
    "however , a long - distance repulsion could potentially lead to an accelerating expanding universe without the need for a cosmological constant .",
    "the toy model is too crude to take this idea particularly seriously at present .",
    "nevertheless , it seems plausible that one could construct a reasonable gravitational model where expansion is driven by gauge potentials as opposed to dark energy .",
    "we will not explore this possibility further here .      in studying the two - body problem",
    ", we argued that the effective hamiltonian for a fracton takes the form : @xmath110 where we have grouped all momentum - independent terms into the potential @xmath111 and have restored the tensor nature of the hopping .",
    "going to the lagrangian formalism , the appropriate action is : @xmath112 this should be compared with the standard geodesic principle of general relativity . the geodesic equation is most easily obtained by applying the variational principle to the proper length of a particle s trajectory , which in the standard treatment is a constant .",
    "but within the framework discussed in this paper , particles have no intrinsic inertial mass @xmath113 , but rather an inertia determined by the background around it . in keeping with this philosophy",
    ", we consider the factor of mass to be part of the dynamical metric , so that the effective metric @xmath20 has dimensions of mass squared . ] : @xmath114 within the present choice of gauge variables ( where all timelike components are eliminated ) , after linearizing around a flat background @xmath115 and taking the low - energy limit , this behaves as : @xmath116 ( up to an additive constant ) .",
    "this will match up precisely with the kinetic part of the fractonic action , equation [ fracact ] , provided we identify the inverse hopping elements as our effective metric : @xmath117 indeed , we argued earlier that , in the case with gapless dipole dispersion and a constant background density @xmath7 of fractons , the hopping elements near a point mass behave as : @xmath118 where @xmath93 is the electric tensor of the point charge , falling off as @xmath91 , for constants @xmath14 and @xmath79 . at large @xmath46 , we can taylor expand the inverse to obtain : @xmath119 this is to be compared with the metric @xmath120 .",
    "the second term is fairly easy to interpret .",
    "the electric tensor @xmath93 has been a proxy for the linearized metric , @xmath28 , in our toy model from the start .",
    "both obey a similar gauss s law and both fall off as @xmath91 in the vicinity of a point charge . we therefore see that , ignoring any potential terms , the action for fractons will lead to a  geodesic \" principle of the same structure as in einstein gravity .",
    "nevertheless , the geodesic principle will have violations when the repulsive gauge potential @xmath71 becomes sufficiently large .",
    "( note that this potential is very different from the standard attractive gravitational potential , which is implicitly taken care of by the geodesic principle . )",
    "it is well - established that geodesics represent the analogue of free motion in general relativity , while other forces , such as electromagnetism , cause deviations from the geodesics .",
    "however , our formulation indicates that , even in the absence of such  external \" forces , a gravity theory can have geodesic violation due to the effects of gravitational gauge potentials .",
    "for example , the long - distance repulsion of the toy model discussed in the previous section would correspond to off - geodesic motion .",
    "we should therefore not regard motion along geodesics as a fundamental postulate of the theory , but as a derived concept which holds when the effects of gauge potentials are small ( which they usually will be in a real gravity model , due to the weakness of the gravitational coupling ) .    while the perturbation term in our metric was straightforward to interpret , the background term is a bit more interesting .",
    "the presence of a flat background term in the metric relied on having a finite density of fractons .",
    "consistency of the geodesic formalism suggests that the flat part of the effective metric should behave as @xmath121 , so that the matter content sets the size of the emergent universe relative to the lattice scale . when there is no finite density of particles , the metric blows up and all points are infinitely far away from each other within the emergent universe .",
    "this is a complementary viewpoint to our earlier discussion in terms of inertia .",
    "instead of viewing an isolated particle as infinitely massive , we can view it as being infinitely far away from all other points in space , leading to the same immobility .",
    "however , the present perspective gives us an interesting way to understand the emergence of space . without a finite density of particles , we no longer possess a smoothly connected space , but rather a set of independent isolated points , infinitely far away from each other .",
    "it is only when we excite the system , filling the emergent universe with particles , that these points coalesce into a connected space and we recover a useful sense of geometry , via the inverse metric picking up an expectation value . as in our discussion of mach",
    "s principle , it is not clear to what extent this is an entirely  new \" idea .",
    "the principle of matter determining the structure of space is already contained in einstein gravity , but the formalism described here gives us a more explicit understanding that matter is constructing the universe around it , as opposed to simply perturbing a pre - existing background .    in this sense , a flat background space is not a fundamental object which we need to put into a gravitational theory by hand , but rather is an emergent concept which is collectively produced by a large number of particles , mutually generating a notion of proximity with each other .",
    "this is essentially mach s principle taken to the extreme : the  distant stars \" not only give inertia to particles , but also create the space in which those particles can move .",
    "this gives yet another reinterpretation of the fracton phenomenon .",
    "fractons can not move because they do not possess a connected background space to move through .",
    "of course , it would be nice to have a more concrete mathematical formulation of these principles .",
    "how to formulate such a theory of emergent geometry without relying on either a flat background or an embedding space is not entirely clear .",
    "one would need to start from an abstract set of disconnected points and construct space from scratch , perhaps through some information - theoretic entanglement measure , as in @xcite .",
    "formulating a theory without the crutch of a background space will likely prove to be a formidable challenge .",
    "in this work , we have laid the groundwork for a conceptual reconciliation of fractons and gravity .",
    "we examined a toy model for emergent gravity consisting of fractons coupled to an emergent graviton .",
    "we showed that the conservation laws leading to fractonic behavior have a natural place in a gravitational theory in the form of conservation of center of mass .",
    "fracton mobility arises via the exchange of propagating particles carrying the center of mass quantum number .",
    "center of mass can be exchanged more efficiently when fractons are close together , leading to an effective gravitational attraction between them .",
    "we argued that gravitational attraction is a natural feature of local models with center of mass conservation .",
    "we also showed how fractons can be endowed with a finite inertia in the presence of a finite density distribution of other fractons , in a direct manifestation of mach s principle .",
    "we analyzed orbital motion , discussing the newtonian limit and the geodesic principle .",
    "we have also put forward ideas on how space itself is created by the particles existing within it .",
    "but there remains much to do .",
    "the model we focused on here only had an emergent energy quantum number . for a more realistic gravity theory",
    ", we should also include an emergent momentum quantum number and carefully study the interplay between the emergent energy and momentum .",
    "we should also work to formulate a fully nonlinear theory , where the graviton serves as a gravitational source . on the technical side ,",
    "some of the calculations done here require a more systematic framework , such as the sum over networks which gave rise to a power - law gravitational attraction .",
    "besides technical work , there also remains a whole host of interesting gravitational problems which might be productively studied from the present fractonic viewpoint .",
    "can we obtain black holes and hawking radiation , for example ?",
    "such questions remain as challenges for the future .",

    "the simplest choice of lattice model was described in references @xcite , with some additional details discussed in references @xcite . in these models , we work with a cubic lattice , on which we will put six independent components of the symmetric tensor : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . since we generally allow the gauge field to be compact ,",

    "an off - diagonal derivative , such as @xmath140 , represents the difference of two links lined up side by side , and will naturally live on the faces ( plaquettes ) of the lattice . using this intuition",
    ", we put the diagonal components of our gauge field ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) on the vertices of the lattice , and we put off - diagonal elements on the appropriate faces .",
    "for example , @xmath125 lives on plaquettes in the @xmath141 plane , and so on .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in figure [ fig : lattice ] .",
    "note that there are three rotors on each vertex .",
    "nevertheless , the three rotors are not identical at the level of hamiltonian , as the @xmath122 component will have interactions predominantly in the @xmath138 direction , and so on .",
    "the situation is quite similar to @xmath142 orbitals on atoms in a cubic lattice environment .",
    "indeed , we expect @xmath142 orbitals to be useful in the search for solid - state realizations of this phase .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , the primary physics of the phase is determined by the gauss s law , which is an energetically imposed constraint on the system . for the phase in question ,",
    "the desired ground state constraint is : @xmath143 we therefore include an energetic penalty term in the hamiltonian of the form : @xmath144 where the derivatives should all be understood as lattice derivatives , such as : @xmath145 with @xmath66 being the lattice spacing .",
    "we also include in our hamiltonian the lowest order energy term for the electric field : @xmath146 ( the factor of @xmath147 is purely for convenience . )",

    ", the only terms that are relevant are those which commute with the gauge constraint .",
    "all other terms can be projectively eliminated from the effective theory for the low - energy sector ( in essentially the same way that one goes from the half - filled hubbard model to the @xmath148 model by projectively eliminating double occupancies ) . for a term in the hamiltonian to commute with the gauge constraint",
    ", an equivalent statement is that it must be invariant under the corresponding gauge transformation .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath93 are canonically conjugate variables , the constraint @xmath12 implies gauge invariance under the transformation : @xmath13 where , once again , all derivatives should be interpreted as lattice derivatives . just as in ordinary electromagnetism",
    ", we need to find some  magnetic field \" object which is invariant under the gauge transformation .",
    "it can be explicitly checked that the lowest order magnetic object which can be constructed takes the form @xmath149 .",
    "we then include a term in the hamiltonian of the form : @xmath150 we started with a cosine , in order to respect compactness . in the deconfined phase of the gauge theory",
    ", we can expand the cosine around its minimum@xcite , in close analogy with the standard treatment of compact @xmath11 lattice gauge theory , to obtain a simple quadratic term . at the end of the day , the full hamiltonian reads ( up to constants ) : @xmath151 where ",
    "@xmath152 \" represents terms that do nt commute with the gauge constraint and are therefore irrelevant to the low - energy physics . in other words , these are the  non - gauge - invariant \" terms , which most people would simply regard as non - existent .",
    "however , as emphasized elsewhere @xcite , it is useful to regard gauge symmetry as only being emergent in the low - energy gauge sector , with high - energy violations of the gauge constraint being regarded as massive charges . in that light , these so - called non - gauge - invariant terms are simply the terms governing the dynamics of the massive charges , which are quite important .",
    "( as my advisor t. senthil likes to say ,  @xmath152 \" is often the most important term in the hamiltonian . )    for example , consider the non - gauge - invariant operator @xmath153 , which serves as a raising operator , increasing @xmath133 by one .",

    "when the gauge field is compact , an important question exists regarding the stability of these phases .",
    "for example , in @xmath155 dimensions , a standard compact @xmath11 gauge theory is unstable to confinement@xcite .",
    "this is because the magnetic portion of the action admits instantons (  monopoles \" ) , point - like spacetime defects , which always proliferate in the path integral , gapping the photon and confining the charges , thereby destroying the phase .",
    "( the noncompact version of the theory does not share this instability , due to the lack of monopoles . ) in the @xmath0-dimensional compact @xmath11 gauge theory , on the other hand , the magnetic monopoles are solitons : points in space , lines in spacetime .",
    "solitons differ from instantons in that we can specify dynamics for these particles .",
    "when the monopoles are gapped , there is no proliferation of magnetic defects , and the phase is stable .",
    "it is only when the monopoles condense that the photon is gapped and the phase is destroyed . for this reason ,",

    "when these magnetic charges are gapped , the phase is stable .",

    "( it is unclear if these magnetic defects play any interesting role in the gravitational dynamics of this phase .",
    "these defects are actually 2-dimensional particles , restricted to move transversely to their charge vector , so they do not have the correct structure to play the role of the emergent momentum .",
    "we have ignored these particles throughout the present work , since their inclusion should not modify the central message of the story . in any case",
    ", we can always let such magnetic particles have a much larger gap than electric charges . )",
    "this phase also has a set of generalized maxwell equations , which amount to our toy version of einstein s equations .",
    "we will not go into the derivation here , referring the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "we simply state the result : @xmath158 the top two equations represent the electric and magnetic gauss s laws , and the bottom two represent the generalized ampere and faraday laws .",
    "note that particles in this theory no longer have a vector current @xmath159 representing the motion of individual particles .",
    "rather , there is a tensor current @xmath160 representing two - body hopping processes , which serves as the analogue of the stress tensor @xmath161 in this model .",
    "the first and fourth equations above ( involving @xmath7 and @xmath160 ) are the direct analogue of einstein field equations , namely the @xmath8 and @xmath162 components .",

    "the symbol @xmath157 denotes the magnetic charge , and @xmath164 is the corresponding magnetic current .",
    "these are only nonzero when the gauge field is compact . in the noncompact limit , these terms vanish and the corresponding maxwell equations become trivial , which is why these extra equations are usually not included as einstein equations .",
    "a standard line of thinking holds that we can not obtain emergent gravity within the same spacetime as some original nongravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "this is largely due to the weinberg - witten theorem , which roughly says ( among other things ) that a lorentz - invariant quantum field theory with a conserved stress - energy tensor @xmath32 can not have massless excitations carrying spin higher than 1@xcite . at first glance",
    ", this seems to rule out the possibility of gravity emerging within a given background spacetime .",
    "thus , much more focus has been placed in recent years on holographic theories , where the emergent gravity resides in a dual asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "the holographic framework is quite useful , giving us valuable insight into the structure of quantum gravity , but many principles do not carry over directly to flat or de sitter spacetime . in this work , however , we have described a model where gravity explicitly emerges as the low - energy theory of the original flat @xmath0-dimensional spacetime .",
    "this surely causes some discomfort to many .",
    "should nt the weinberg - witten theorem have prevented this model from existing ?",
    "the answer is that fracton models are outside the jurisdiction of the weinberg - witten theorem , by violating some of its fundamental assumptions , and the limitations of this theorem do not restrain us here .    to begin with ,",
    "there are some obvious ( though not particularly strong ) reasons why the toy model discussed here is outside the domain of weinberg - witten .",
    "one could cite the fact that the toy model is not fully lorentz - invariant .",
    "one could also cite the fact that , in the linearized model considered here , the graviton did not carry the gravitational charge .",
    "technically speaking , this already frees us from the weinberg - witten theorem .",
    "however , as we have discussed , minor modifications should allow both emergent lorentz invariance and nonlinearity to appear in the theory , so we should not put much weight on these lines of argument .    as physicists , it is much more important for us to understand why the _ spirit _ of weinberg - witten is being violated . at the end of the day",
    ", our circumvention of the weinberg - witten theorem is permitted by the nature of fractons .",
    "the proof of the weinberg - witten theorem relies heavily on the use of asymptotic single - particle momentum eigenstates . for fractons ,",
    "however , eigenstates with finite momentum only exist when the fracton is in the presence of a finite density of other fractons . in the asymptotic regime , where all particles are well - separated",
    ", fractons lose their mobility and momentum states no longer exist as well - defined excitations of the system .",
    "the lesson we learn from the fractonic viewpoint is that momentum eigenstates can not be viewed as fundamental asymptotic single - particle excitations of a gravitational system , but rather as an effective description of a particle  pushing off \" a macroscopic collection of other particles , which are pushed in the opposite direction .",
    "similarly , for gauge theories of spin higher than 2 , where the conservation laws are even more restrictive , it is questionable whether there exists anything even resembling a momentum eigenstate . for these theories",
    ", the fundamental formulation really occurs in position space .",
    "the insights gained from fractons therefore change our understanding of the weinberg - witten theorem .",
    "it is not the case that interacting massless higher spin theories do nt exist , but rather that these theories do not admit well - defined asymptotic momentum eigenstates for their charges , which is a special feature of lower - spin gauge theories ."
