    "<S> recently , invisible cloaks have attracted much attention due to their exciting property of invisibility , which are based on a solid theory of transformation optics and quasi - conformal mapping . </S>",
    "<S> two kinds of cloaks have been proposed : free - space cloaks , which can render objects in free space invisible to incident radiation , and carpet cloaks ( or ground cloaks ) , which can hide objects under the conducting ground . </S>",
    "<S> the first free - space and carpet cloaks were realized in the microwave frequencies using metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> the free - space cloak was composed of resonant metamaterials , and hence had restriction of narrow bandwidth and high loss ; the carpet cloak was made of non - resonant metamaterials , which have broad bandwidth and low loss . </S>",
    "<S> however , the carpet cloak has a severe restriction of large size compared to the cloaked object . </S>",
    "<S> the above restrictions become the bottlenecks to the real applications of free - space and carpet cloaks . here </S>",
    "<S> we report the first experimental demonstration of broadband and low - loss directive free - space cloak and compact - sized carpet cloak based on a recent theoretical study . </S>",
    "<S> both cloaks are realized using non - resonant metamaterials in the microwave frequency , and good invisibility properties have been observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this approach represents a major step towards the real applications of invisibility cloaks .    1.0 mm    pacs numbers . </S>",
    "<S> 41.20.jb , 42.25.gy , 42.79.-e    recently , a new theory of transformation optics and quasiconformal mapping has been proposed to design the electromagnetic metamaterials to control the paths of electromagnetic waves [ 1,2,4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> based on the physical principle , an electromagnetic wave will always travel in the quickest route between two points . in a homogeneous and isotropic material , </S>",
    "<S> the route is a straight line . in an inhomogeneous material , </S>",
    "<S> the route becomes nonlinear to make the total traveling time be minimal because the wave travels at different speeds inside . hence one can control the route of wave by designing the material parameters , which has found a lot of potential applications such as cloaking objects invisible [ 1 - 7 ] , concentrating of electromagnetic waves [ 8,9 ] , rotating of electromagnetic waves [ 10 ] , bending of electromagnetic waves [ 11 ] , and forming multi - beam antennas [ 12 ] . </S>",
    "<S> artificial metamaterials provide flexible choices of the designed parameters .    among above potential applications , </S>",
    "<S> the invisibility cloak is the most attractive . </S>",
    "<S> there have been two kinds of invisibility cloaks proposed : free - space cloaks and carpet cloaks . </S>",
    "<S> a free - space cloak is a designed material shell covering an object in free space , which can guide the waves to propagate around the shell , making the object inside invisible [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical tool to study invisible cloak is the so - called transformation optics [ 13 ] , which is based on the coordinate transformation [ 14 ] . </S>",
    "<S> an optical conformal mapping method was used to design the material parameters that create perfect invisibility [ 1,2 ] , in which the permittivity tensor @xmath0 and the permeability tensor @xmath1 are both spatially varying and anisotropic with singular values . by implementing such complicated full material properties , the concealed object and </S>",
    "<S> the cloak appear to have the free - space properties exactly when viewed externally , which has been verified by full - wave simulations [ 15 ] and analytic solutions [ 16 ] .    however , the fully inhomogeneous and anisotropic parameters for perfect free - space cloaks require extremely complicated metamaterial design . for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) cylindrical cloak in free space , </S>",
    "<S> when the electric field is polarized along the cylinder axis , the full parameters can be greatly simplified [ 3 ] . since the reduced constitutive parameters provide the same dispersion equation as the full parameters for the 2d cloak , the electromagnetic waves have the same trajectory inside the cloak with a penalty of nonzero reflections . </S>",
    "<S> using the reduced parameters , the first practical free - space cloak has been realized in the microwave frequency [ 3 ] . in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> a conducting cylinder was hidden inside the cloak , which was constructed with the use of artificially structured metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> due to the requirement of very large and very small values of refraction index , resonant structures [ 17 ] have been applied . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the invisible cloak operate in a narrow frequency band with a relatively large loss . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment and simulation results have a good match . but notable reflections and shadow of the hidden object were observed due to the use of simplified parameters and relatively large loss [ 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow bandwidth and large loss become the big restriction to real applications of free - space cloaks .    in view of the difficulty to realize the free - space cloaks , </S>",
    "<S> a recently published theory has suggested a carpet cloak , or ground - plane cloak , which can hide any objects under a metamaterial carpet [ 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> different from the free - space invisibility cloak , which crushes the cloaked object to a point , the carpet cloak crushes the hidden object to a conducting sheet [ 4 ] . in the other word , </S>",
    "<S> any objects hidden under the carpet appear as a flat conducting sheet , and hence can not be detected by any exterior sources . </S>",
    "<S> the great advantage of the carpet cloak is that it does not require singular values for the material parameters [ 1 ] . by choosing appropriate coordinate transformation </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown that the anisotropy of the cloak can be minimized and the range of the permittivity and permeability is much smaller than that for the free - space cloak [ 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence the carpet cloak is easier to be realized using metamaterials .    </S>",
    "<S> the carpet cloak has very important applications , especially in the microwave frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it can be used to hide the aircraft on the airport , and the automobile on the ground , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the carpet cloaks have been experimentally demonstrated firstly in the microwave frequency [ 5 ] , and then in the optical frequency [ 6,18 ] , using non - resonant metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> the non - resonant metamaterials have very low loss and operate in a broad frequency band , hence the carpet cloaks have good invisibility performance [ 5,6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are two restrictions in the existing carpet - cloak experiments : 1 ) the background is not free space to get easily realized material parameters ( in the microwave experiment , the refractive index of background material was chosen as 1.331 [ 5 ] ; in the optical experiment , the refractive index of background material was chosen as 1.58 [ 6 ] ) ; 2 ) the carpet cloak has a very large size ( in the microwave experiment , the area ratio of the carpet cloak to the cloaked region is as high as 65.7 [ 5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the above restrictions make the carpet cloak be difficult in real applications .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate experimentally the first broadband and low - loss directive free - space cloak and compact - sized carpet cloak in the free - space background . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments are based on a recent theoretical study [ 7 ] , which proposed a simplified carpet cloak ( or ground - plane cloak ) made of only a few blocks of all - dielectric isotropic materials . in our experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the simplified carpet cloak is realized using non - resonant metamaterials in the microwave frequency , which has a much smaller size than the full carpet cloak reported in ref . [ 5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the area ratio of the cloak to the cloaked region is as small as 7.33 , which is only 11.2% of the full cloak . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presented carpet cloak has equally good invisibility performance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a broadband and low - loss directive free - space cloak is realized , that cloaks the radiation originating from specified directions . </S>",
    "<S> hence the presented work makes a major step towards the real applications of invisibility cloaks .    for the design of the simplified carpet cloak , we consider a 2d problem in which all the fields are invariant in the @xmath2 direction and </S>",
    "<S> the electric fields are @xmath2-polarized . </S>",
    "<S> the cloaked object is a car model , which is placed under a triangular conducting region . </S>",
    "<S> the reason to choose the triangular shape is for easy installation in real applications . we want to design a compact - sized carpet cloak which is covering on the triangular region to make the whole system appear as the original flat conducting plane as if the car does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the shape of cloak as a rectangle with the width 125 mm and hight 50 mm except that the bottom boundary is partially triangularly - shaped to place the car . </S>",
    "<S> hence the car model is concealed between the carpet cloak and the conducting plane as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) .    to design a compact - sized carpet cloak , </S>",
    "<S> the process of parameter calculation contains two stages . </S>",
    "<S> first , we followed the technique presented in [ 4 ] to get the complete cloaking region , in which a quasi - conformal coordinate mapping is generated by minimizing the modified - liao functional [ 20 , 21 ] upon slipping boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the refractive - index distribution of the cloak is computed numerically , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , in which the maximum anisotropic factor is 1.07 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we use the grid optimization by recursive division of cartesian cells to sample the original refractive - index distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in such a course , the small regions near the base corners of the triangular object where the refractive - index is smaller than 1 are treated as free space . </S>",
    "<S> since the background of the designed cloak is free space , the transformation generates cells in region i ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) whose refractive indices are nearly 1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence such a region can be simplified as free space , and the cloak will reduce to the region ii ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) . the refractive index distribution of the final carpet cloak is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , in which the refractive indices are varied from 1 to 1.69 .    </S>",
    "<S> the compact - sized carpet cloak is divided to 3-by-3-mm squares with non - resonant elements shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) and 1(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> by changing the dimension @xmath3 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) ) from 0 to 2.2 mm , we are able to span the required index range from @xmath4 1.07 to 1.87 at 10 ghz . after a well - established retrieval process , </S>",
    "<S> the effective permittivity and permeability for a given element can be found by numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) shows the curve that relates the refractive index to a given element with the length @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> since the cell - to - cell change in dimension is minor , the impedance is matched gradually in the whole cloak over the entire measurement frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> the compact - sized carpet cloak is fabricated on copper - clad printed circuit board ( pcb ) with f4b substrate ( the substrate thickness is 0.25 mm , with a dielectric constant of 2.65 and loss tangent of 0.001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the carpet has a size of @xmath5 mm@xmath6 with a height of 12 mm . </S>",
    "<S> the cloaking transformation is specifically designed to compensate the triangular concealed region with the height 13 mm and the bottom 125 mm .    to validate the invisible effect of the simplified carpet cloak , </S>",
    "<S> we make use of a near - field scanning system to map the electric - field distribution within a planar waveguide . in the planar waveguide </S>",
    "<S> , the wave polarization is restricted to transverse electric . </S>",
    "<S> the electric - field maps of the scattering region , including the collimated incident and scattered beams , are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the incident waves are launched into the chamber from a standard x - band coax - to - waveguide coupler to produce a nearly collimated microwave plane beam . </S>",
    "<S> the beam is arbitrarily chosen to be incident on the ground plane at an angle of 45@xmath7 with respect to the normal .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the measured near - field distributions and the far - field patterns of the carpet cloak . from figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and ( b ) , there is considerable difference between the reflections from the flat and curved surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the beam reflected from the uncloaked triangular bump shows the strong scattering of the bump . </S>",
    "<S> the flat surface illustrates the expected collimation beam profile , similar to that of the incident wave . to hide the bump on the surface , the designed carpet cloak was placed around the bump and the measured result </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , similar to the flat reflecting surface , a single reflected beam is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the cloak has successfully transformed the curved surface into a flat surface , giving the observer the impression that the beam was reflected from a flat surface . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the fact that there is no penetration of light into the bump , the car model could be placed behind it and effectively hidden , making the car invisible . </S>",
    "<S> the far - field patterns are plotted in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(g)-(i ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the ground plane and the cloaked triangular concealed region , the beam profiles show a very similar single peak ; that is , the good cloaking performance is observed . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the above cases , the bump alone exhibits a multi - peak far - field pattern ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2h ) , indicating the strong perturbation of the beam .    to verify the broadband properties of the carpet cloak , </S>",
    "<S> measurements were carried out over a wide range of frequencies . the cloaking behavior was confirmed in our measurements from 10 ghz to 13 ghz , as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cloak is excepted to work very well within a more wide frequency band although it can not be verified experimentally due to limitations of the measurement apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> figs.2(d)-2(f ) show similar cloaking behavior to the map taken at 10 ghz in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the compact - sized carpet cloaks discussed above only work in the presence of ground - plane . </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider a compact - sized and broadband free - space cloak based on the electromagnetic mirror principle although the free - space cloak works only for a specified direction , as suggested in [ 4 , 7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> such a kind of directive free - space cloaks can also find a lot of specific applications like air flight , space exploration , etc . </S>",
    "<S> for practical reason , here we choose the outer boundary of the free - space cloak as a prolate cylinder , whose long axis is 125 mm and short axis is 60 mm ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . starting from the compact - sized carpet cloak design shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , which is similar to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , the ground plane is removed and the cloaked region in company with the object is mirrored on @xmath8 . as a result , a metallic diamond - shaped object is surrounded with a free - space compact - sized cloaking material , as shown in fig 3(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) and 3(d ) illustrate the photos of the free - space cloak and the diamond - shaped conducting object in free - space background . in the experiment , a foam , whose electromagnetic properties are similar to free space , was used to fix the metamaterials . since the refractive indices on two sides of the cloak along the @xmath9 axis are almost one as marked by the red dashed lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , such areas can be designed as free space . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is fabricated by using non - resonant metmaterial unit elements similar to the compact - sized carpet cloak presented earlier .    to visualize the performance of the compact - sized and broadband free - space cloak , we make full - wave simulations based on the finite - element method . in principle , an incident electromagnetic wave would perceive a perfectly cloaked object as a metallic surface in the @xmath8 plane with infinitesimal thickness . such a device will scatter the impinging wave significantly for most incident angles , except when the wave is propagating along the @xmath9 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation results are illustrated in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) and ( b ) when a plane wave is impinging upon a conducting diamond - shaped object without and with the free - space cloak . </S>",
    "<S> a very strong shadow is observed behind the bare object , along with a weak backward scattering pattern due to the sharp edge of the diamond object ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the designed cloak is placed around the diamond object . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that there is no shadow left as the wavefronts are bending and recomposing on the back of the object , with only a slight distortion , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the object would be effectively cloaked .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurement results of the diamond - shaped metallic object without and with the free - space directive cloak are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) and 4(d ) when the collimated beam is incident horizonally at 10 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the measured field patterns have excellent agreements to the simulation results . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) , we observe that when the wave reaches the left corner of the diamond - shaped metallic object , the index gradient is increasing away from the boundary of the object , and hence the wave bends away from the object . then </S>",
    "<S> , near the tip of the object , the wave bends back towards the object because the index gradient is reversed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , due to the increasing index gradient away from the object near the right corner , the wave is bent away from the object , and then return back to their original propagation direction .    to verify the broadband properties of the free - space cloak </S>",
    "<S> , measurements were implemented over a wide range of frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the cloaking behavior has been confirmed in these measurements from 8 to 12 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the broad bandwidth of the cloak with the field maps taken at 8 ghz in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(e ) , 9 ghz in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(f ) , 11 ghz in fig . 4(g ) and 12 ghz in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(h ) , which show similar cloaking behavior to the map taken at 10 ghz in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method would be increasingly favorable for compact - sized cloaking objects in free - space background when considering its design simplicity , since only a few blocks of all - dielectric materials are required in order to achieve broadband and low - loss performance .    both compact - sized carpet cloak and directive free - space cloak are designed based on the isotropic and non - resonant unit elements , hence the presented cloaks are broadband and low - loss . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the measured field patterns and the theory [ 7 ] provides convincing evidence that metamaterials can indeed be widely applied in practice . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental demonstration of compact - sized invisibility cloaks represents a major step towards real applications of invisibility devices .    </S>",
