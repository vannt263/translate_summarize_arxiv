    "about half of the stars are in binaries and binary evolution plays a crucial role in the formation of many interesting objects , such as algols , fk comae ( fk com ) stars , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , barium ( ba ) stars , ch stars , type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , am canum venaticorum ( am cvn ) stars , low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) , high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) , symbiotic ( sym ) stars , blue stragglers ( bss ) , pulsars , subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars , double degenerates ( dds ) etc .",

    "a binary system ( of low / intermediate mass ) has two components : the primary ( the initially more massive one ) and the secondary .",

    "the ce engulfs the core of the primary and the secondary , and does not co - rotate with the embedded binary .",
    "the friction between the ce and the embedded binary makes the orbit decay , and a large amount of orbital energy released is deposited into the ce .",
    "if the ce can be ejected , a close wd binary forms , otherwise a fast rotating merger is resulted . for a wd binary system ,",
    "the secondary continues to evolve and may experience mass transfer .",
    "similar to the process described above , the mass transfer may lead to the formation of a ce and the ce ejection produces a double degenerate .",
    "figure  [ flow ] is a flow chart of binary evolution .",
    "it is by no means comprehensive , but it does show evolutionary channels leading to various objects for a binary system with given conditions .    a good stellar evolution theory should give and predict the statistical properties of a stellar population as well as the properties of individual stars or binaries . binary population synthesis ( bps )",
    "is to evolve a large number of stars ( including binaries ) in order to investigate statistical properties of stars and check evolutionary mechanisms for different types of stars . in a bps study , we first generate a binary sample ( 10 million binaries ) , then evolve the sample according to stellar evolution model grids and taking into account binary interactions , and we obtain different types of binary - related objects , which can be directly compared to observations .",
    "in addition to the grids of stellar evolutionary models , we adopt the following input in bps simulations :    \\(1 ) a constant star - formation rate is taken over the last 15gyr for a field population , or alternatively , a single star burst for a globular cluster or an elliptical galaxy .",

    "the adopted distribution gives that @xmath6% of stellar systems are binary systems with orbital periods less than 100 yr .",
    "the main model parameters in bps are mass transfer efficiency @xmath7 for the first stable rlof ( where the accretor is a main sequence star ) , ce ejection efficiency @xmath8 and thermal contribution @xmath9 for ce evolution .",
    "the mass transfer efficiency @xmath7 is the fraction of the envelope mass that is transferred onto the secondary rather than is ejected from the system , where we assume that the matter lost from the system carries away the specific angular momentum of the system .",
    "a typical value for @xmath7 is 0.5 .",
    "the ce ejection efficiency @xmath8 is the fraction of the released orbital energy used to overcome the binding energy of the envelope during the spiral - in process of a ce .",
    "the thermal contribution @xmath9 defines the fraction of the internal energy of thermodynamics ( including recombination energy as well as the thermal energy ) contributing to the binding energy of the ce .",

    "han et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposed a binary model for their formation . in the model , there are three types of formation channels for sdb stars : stable rlof for sdb binaries with long orbital periods , ce ejection for sdb binaries with short orbital periods , and the merger of helium wds to form single ehb stars . in the stable rlof channel , the mass donor fills its roche lobe near the tip of the first giant branch and experiences a stable mass transfer , and its envelope is striped off by the rlof , and the naked helium core ( with thin hydrogen envelope ) get ignited to produce a sdb stars . in the ce ejection channel",
    ", the mass donor also fills its roche lobe near the tip of the first giant branch to have a dynamically unstable mass transfer leading to the formation of a ce .",
    "the ce ejection leaves a naked helium core ( with thin hydrogen envelope ) and the naked helium core is ignited to produce a sdb star . in the ce channel , the donor star needs to fill its roche lobe closer to the tip of the first giant branch , or , in other words , the minimum core mass required for the donor star at the onset of mass transfer is larger than that in the stable rlof channel to produce a sdb star .",
    "this is simply because that the time scale of the ce evolution is much shorter than that of the stable rlof and the core does not grow by much in the ce process . in the merger channel , a close helium wd pair coalesces due to angular momentum loss via gravitational wave radiation . the binary model of han et al .",
    "( @xcite ) has successfully explained the main observational characteristics of field sdb stars : their distributions in the orbital period - minimum companion mass diagram , and in the effective temperature - surface gravity diagram ; their distributions of orbital period and mass function ; their binary fraction and the fraction of sdb binaries with wd companions ; their birth rates ; and their space density .",
    "the model is indeed a step forward and is widely used in the study of sdb stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* otool , heber & benjamin , 2004 ) ) .",
    "@xcite have done radial - velocity surveys for extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars , the counterparts of field sdb stars , in globular clusters .",
    "they found that there is a remarkable lack of close binary systems in ehb stars .",
    "this is surprising as compared to the high binary fraction in field sdb stars .",
    "they speculated that there may exist a binary fraction - age relation for sdb stars .",
    "@xcite showed that such a relation does exist and the binary model of han et al .",
    "( @xcite ) can reproduce the ehb stars in globular clusters , in particular , the low binary fraction of the ehb stars .",
    "the main reason for the low binary fraction is that the stars in a globular cluster are all old , and the envelopes of donor stars in the ce channel are loosely bound , leading to wide ehb binaries rather than close ones .",
    "one of the first major discoveries soon after the advent of uv astronomy was the discovery of an excess of light in the far - ultraviolet ( far - uv ) in elliptical galaxies ( see the review by oconnell , @xcite ) .",
    "this came as a complete surprise since elliptical galaxies were supposed to be entirely composed of old , red stars and not to contain any young stars that radiate in the uv . since then it has become clear that the far - uv excess ( or upturn ) is not a sign of active contemporary star formation , but is caused by an older population of helium - burning stars or their descendants with a characteristic surface temperature of 25,000k ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ferguson et al . , 1991 ) ) .",
    "the origin of this population of hot , blue stars in an otherwise red population has , however , remained a major mystery . as we described above , the binary model of han et al .",
    "( @xcite ) reproduces galactic hot subdwarfs ( synonymous with sdb stars in this paper ) .",
    "the key feature of the channels in the model is that they provide the missing physical mechanism for ejecting the envelope and for producing a hot subdwarf .",
    "moreover , since it is known that these hot subdwarfs provide an important source of far - uv light in our own galaxy , it is not only reasonable to assume that they will also contribute significantly to the far - uv in elliptical galaxies , but is in fact expected .",
    "it would , therefore , be `` a priori '' to apply the han et al .",

    "the far - uv sed no longer changes appreciably relative to the visual flux .",
