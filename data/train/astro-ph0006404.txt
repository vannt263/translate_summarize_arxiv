    "due to the many well known successes of the standard theory of stellar evolution , rotation has generally been considered as a secondary effect .",
    "this was justified in many cases . however , since some years a number of very significant discrepancies between model predictions and observations have been found for massive stars , and also for red giants of lower masses .",
    "these difficulties have been listed and examined ( cf .",
    "maeder @xcite ) .",
    "recently , large excesses of [ n / h ] have been found in a ",
    "type supergiants , particularly in the smc ( venn et al .",
    "@xcite ; venn @xcite ) , where the excesses may reach up to an order of magnitude with respect to the average [ n / h ] local value in the smc .",
    "these excesses , not predicted by current models , are the signatures of mixing effects over the entire star .",
    "this extensive mixing changes the size of the reservoir of nuclear fuel available for evolution , and thus the lifetimes , the tracks and all the model outputs ( cf . also langer 1992 ; langer 1997 ; heger et al .",
    "2000 ) . also the chemical abundances , the yields and the final stages may be modified .",
    "rotation appears as a natural driver for this mixing or , at least , as one of the first mechanisms whose consequences for mixing has to be explored .",
    "this is especially true for massive stars which are known to be fast rotators ( see e.g. penny 1996 ; howarth et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the physical effects of stellar rotation are numerous .",
    "the basic equations of stellar structure need to be modified .",
    "the meridional circulation and its interaction with the horizontal turbulence , the diffusion effects produced by shear turbulence , the inhibition of the transport mechanisms by the @xmath6gradients , the transport of the angular momentum and of the chemical elements , the loss of mass and angular momentum at the surface , the enhancement of mass loss by rotation , etc    are some of the effects to be included in realistic models .",
    "in addition to the model physics , rotation also brings a number of new numerical problems in the stellar code , such as the 4@xmath7 order equation for the transport of the angular momentum , which has to be coupled to the equations of stellar structure .    in this work",
    ", we apply the investments in the treatment of the physical and numerical effects of rotation made in the previous works and we explore their consequences for the outputs of stellar models . in sect .",
    "2 , we describe the various effects considered .",
    "the non  rotating stellar models are briefly discussed in sect .",
    "the evolution of the internal rotation during the evolution is examined in sect .",
    "5 discusses the effects of rotation on the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram , on the lifetimes and isochrones .",
    "the evolution of the rotational velocities at the stellar surface is discussed in sect .",
    "6 and the effects on the surface abundances are analysed in sect .",
    "let us briefly summarize here the basic physical ingredients of the numerical models of rotating stars we are constructing here .      the differential rotation which results from the evolution and transport of the angular momentum as described by eq .",
    "( 3 ) below , makes the stellar interior highly turbulent .",
    "the turbulence is very anisotropic , with a much stronger geostrophic  like transport in the horizontal direction than in the vertical one ( zahn @xcite ) , where stabilisation is favoured by the stable temperature gradient .",
    "this strong horizontal transport is characterized by a diffusion coefficient @xmath8 , which is quite large as will be shown below .",
    "the horizontal turbulent coupling favours an essentially constant angular velocity @xmath9 on the isobars .",
    "this rotation law , constant on shells , applies to fast as well as to slow rotators . as an approximation",
    ", it is often represented by a law of the form @xmath10 ( zahn @xcite ; see also endal and sofia @xcite ) .      in a rotating star ,",
    "the equations of stellar structure need to be modified ( kippenhahn and thomas @xcite ) .",
    "the usual spherical coordinates must be replaced by new coordinates characterizing the equipotentials .",
    "the classical method applies when the effective gravity can be derived from a potential @xmath11 , i.e. when the problem is conservative .",
    "there , @xmath12 is the gravitational potential which in the roche approximation is @xmath13 .",
    "if the rotation law is shellular , the problem is non  conservative .",
    "most existing models of rotating stars apply , rather inconsistently , the classical scheme by kippenhahn and thomas .",
    "however , as shown by meynet and maeder ( @xcite ) , the equations of stellar structure can still be written consistently , in term of a coordinate referring to the mass inside the isobaric surfaces .",
    "thus , the problem of the stellar structure of a differentially rotating star with an angular velocity @xmath14 can be kept one  dimensional .",
    "the distribution of temperature at the surface of a rotating star is described by the von zeipel theorem ( @xcite ) .",
    "usually , this theorem applies to the conservative case and states that the local radiative flux @xmath15 is proportional to the local effective gravity @xmath16 , which is the sum of the gravity and centrifugal force ,    @xmath17    with @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is the luminosity on an isobar and @xmath20 the mean internal density .",
    "the local @xmath21 on the surface of a rotating star varies like @xmath22 .",
    "we define the average stellar @xmath21 by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is stefan s constant and @xmath25 the total actual stellar surface . of course , for different orientation angles @xmath26",
    ", the emergent luminosity , colours and spectrum will be different ( maeder and peytremann @xcite ) . in the case of non  conservative rotation law , the corrections to the von zeipel theorem",
    "depend on the opacity law and on the degree of differential rotation , but they are small , i.e. @xmath27 in current cases of shellular rotation ( kippenhahn @xcite ; maeder @xcite ) .",
    "wether or not the star is close to the eddington limit , the von zeipel theorem keeps the same form as the one given by maeder ( 1999 , see also maeder & meynet @xcite ) . in this last work ,",
    "it is in particular shown that the expression for the eddington factor in a rotating star needs to be consistently written and that it contains a term depending on rotation .",
    "observationally , a growth of the mass flux of ob stars with rotation , i.e.  by 23 powers of 10 , was found by vardya ( @xcite ) , while nieuwenhuijzen and de jager ( @xcite ) concluded that the @xmath29rates seem to increase only slightly with rotation for o and b  type stars . on the theoretical side , friend and abbott ( 1986 )",
    "find an increase of the @xmath28rates which can be fitted by the relation ( langer @xcite )    @xmath30    with @xmath31 and @xmath32 the equatorial velocity at break  up .",
    "this expression is used in most evolutionary models and this is also what is done in the present work .",
    "the critical rotation velocity of a star is often written as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the equatorial radius at break  up velocity and @xmath35 is the ratio of the stellar luminosity to the eddington luminosity ( cf .",
    "langer 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "glatzel ( 1998 ) has shown that when the effect of gravity darkening is taken into account , the above expression for @xmath36 does not apply .",
    "glatzel ( 1998 ) gives @xmath37 , which we adopt here .",
    "the problem is now being further examined by maeder & meynet ( 2000a ) , who critically discuss the eddington factors , their dependence on rotation , the expression of the critical velocity , the dependence of the mass loss rates on rotation .",
    "these various new results will be applied in subsequent works , particularly for the study of the effects of rotation on the formation of w ",
    "further improvements , based either on the observations or on the theory , to account for the anisotropic winds which selectively remove the angular momentum need also to be performed .    the above expression gives the change of the mass loss rates due to rotation . as reference mass loss rates in the case of no rotation",
    ", we use the recent data by lamers and cassinelli ( @xcite ) ; for the domain not covered by these authors we use the results by de jager et al .",

    ". only the radial term @xmath48 appears in eq .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is the total diffusion coefficient representing the various instabilities considered and which transport the angular momentum , namely convection , semiconvection and shear turbulence . as a matter of fact",
    ", a very large diffusion coefficient as in convective regions implies a rotation law which is not far from solid body rotation . in this work",
    ", we take @xmath50 in radiative zones , since as extra  convective mixing we consider shear mixing and meridional circulation . in case the outward transport of the angular momentum by the shear",
    "is compensated by an inward transport due to the meridional circulation , we obtain the local conservation of the angular momentum .",
    "we call this solution the _ stationary solution_. in this case , @xmath48 is given by ( cf .",
    "zahn @xcite )    @xmath51    the full solution of eq .",

    "this produces a feedback and , thus , a self  consistent solution for the evolution of @xmath52 has to be found .",
    "the transport of angular momentum by circulation has often been treated as a diffusion process ( endal and sofia @xcite ; pinsonneault et al .",
    "@xcite ; heger et al .",
    "@xcite ) . from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we see that the term with @xmath53 ( advection ) is functionally not the same as the term with @xmath49 ( diffusion ) .",
    "physically advection and diffusion are quite different : diffusion brings a quantity from where there is a lot to other places where there is little .",
    "this is not necessarily the case for advection .",
    "a circulation with a positive value of @xmath48 , i.e.  rising along the polar axis and descending at the equator , is as a matter of fact making an inward transport of angular momentum .",
    "thus , we see that when this process is treated as a diffusion , like a function of @xmath54 , even the sign of the effect may be wrong .",
    "the expression of @xmath48 given below ( eq .  12 ) involves derivatives up to the third order , thus eq .",
    "( 3 ) is of the fourth order , which makes the system very difficult to solve numerically . in practice",
    ", we have applied a henyey scheme to make the calculations .",
    "( 3 ) also implies four boundary conditions . at the stellar surface ,",
    "we take ( cf .",
    "talon et al .",
    "@xcite ; denissenkov et al .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath55    and at the edge of the core we have    @xmath56    we assume that the mass lost by stellar winds is just embarking its own angular momentum .",
    "this means that we ignore any possible magnetic coupling , as it occurs in low mass stars .",
    "this is not unreasonable in view of the negative results about the detection of magnetic fields in massive stars ( mathys @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to mention here , that in case of no viscous , nor magnetic coupling at the stellar surface , _ i.e. _ with the boundary conditions ( 6 ) , the integration of eq .",
    "( 3 ) gives for an external shell of mass @xmath57 ( maeder 1999 , paper iv )    @xmath58    this equation is valid provided the stellar winds are spherically symmetric ( see paper iv ) , an assumption we do in this work .",
    "when the surface velocity approches the critical velocity , it is likely that there are anisotropies of the mass loss rates ( polar ejection or formation of an equatorial ring ) and thus the surface condition should be modified according to the prescriptions of maeder ( @xcite ) . for now , these effects are not included in these models .",
    "their neglect should not affect too much the results presented here since the critical velocity is reached only in some rare circumstances .",
    "a diffusion  advection equation like eq .",
    "( 3 ) should normally be used to express the transport of chemical elements . however ,",
    "if the horizontal component of the turbulent diffusion @xmath8 is large , the vertical advection of the elements can be treated as a simple diffusion ( chaboyer and zahn @xcite ) with a diffusion coefficient @xmath59 .",
    "as emphasized by chaboyer and zahn , this does not apply to the transport of the angular momentum .",

    "( 8) expresses that the vertical advection of chemical elements is severely inhibited by the strong horizontal turbulence characterized by @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the change of the mass fraction @xmath62 of the chemical species @xmath26 is simply    @xmath63 +   \\left(\\frac{d x_i}{dt } \\right)_{\\rm nucl } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the second term on the right accounts for composition changes due to nuclear reactions .",

    "in this context , we recall that several authors have reduced by large factors , up to 30 or 100 , the coefficient for the transport of the chemical elements , with respect to the transport of the angular momentum , in order to better fit the observed surface compositions ( cf .",

    "( 12 ) results from the vertical chemical gradient and from the coupling between the horizontal and vertical @xmath6gradients due to the horizontal turbulence .",
    "this term @xmath68 may be one or two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath74 in some layers , so that @xmath75 may be reduced by the same ratio .",
    "this is one of the important differences introduced by the work by maeder and zahn ( @xcite ) .",
    "another difference is that the classical solution usually predicts an infinite velocity at the interface between a radiative and a semiconvective zone with an inverse circulation in the semiconvective zone .",

    "shear due to differential rotation is likely to be a most efficient mixing process .",
    "indeed shear instability grows on a dynamical timescale that is of the order of the rotation period ( zahn @xcite ) .",
    "the usual criterion for shear instability is the richardson criterion , which compares the balance between the restoring force of the density gradient and the excess energy present in the differentially rotating layers ,    @xmath76    where we have taken the average over an isobar , @xmath43 is the radius and @xmath77 the brunt - visl frequency given by    @xmath78.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when thermal dissipation is significant , the restoring force of buoyancy is reduced and the instability occurs more easily , its timescale is however longer , being the thermal timescale .",

    "a discussion of shear  driven turbulence by canuto ( @xcite ) suggests that the limiting @xmath86 number may be larger than @xmath87 .    to account for shear transport and diffusion in eqs .",

    " 2 . pinsonneault et al .",
    "( @xcite ) notice that the amount of differential rotation permitted by the secular shears is proportional to a critical number , which they treat as an adjustable parameter . to account for the effects of the @xmath6gradient in mixing , of the loss of angular momentum , etc ",
    "they introduce several adjustable parameters in the equations for the transport of the chemical elements and of the angular momentum .",
    "chaboyer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) use a coefficient derived from the velocity and path length from zahn ( @xcite ) .",
    "following pinsonneault et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , they also introduce two adjustable parameters for adjusting the transports of chemical elements and angular momentum respectively .",
    "we notice that thanks to the reduction of the diffusion produced by the horizontal turbulence ( cf .",
    "eq .  9 above ) , it is no longer necessary to arbitrarily reduce the vertical transport of the chemical elements .",
    "zahn ( @xcite ) defines the diffusion coefficient corresponding to the eddies which have the largest @xmath79 number so that the richardson criterion is just marginally satisfied .",
    "however , the effects of the vertical @xmath6gradient are not accounted for and the expression only applies to low peclet numbers .",
    "the same has been done by maeder and meynet ( @xcite ) , who considers also the effect of the vertical @xmath6gradient , the case of general peclet numbers and , in addition they account for the coupling due to the fact that the shear also modifies the local thermal gradient .",

    "the comparisons of model results and observations of surface abundances have led many authors to conclude that the @xmath6gradients appear to inhibit the shear mixing too much with respect to what is required by the observations ( chaboyer et al .",

    "namely , the observations of o  type stars ( herrero et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) show much more he and n  enrichments than predicted by the models which apply richardon s criterion with the @xmath68 term .",
    "thus , instead of using a gradient @xmath68 in the criterion for shear mixing , chaboyer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and heger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) write @xmath90 with a factor @xmath91 or even smaller .",
    "this procedure is not satisfactory since it only accounts for a small fraction of the existing @xmath6gradients in stars .",
    "the problem is that the models depend at least as much ( if not more ) on @xmath92 than on rotation , _",
    "i.e. _ a change of @xmath92 in the allowed range ( between 0 and 1 ) produces as important effects as a change of the initial rotational velocity .",
    "this situation has led to two other more physical approaches discussed below .",

    "the physical treatment around the core also depends on the choice of the criterion for convection . in current literature , there are at least three basic sets of assumptions : a ) ledoux criterion , which leads to small cores , b ) schwarzschild s criterion , which gives `` medium size '' cores , c ) schwarzschild s criterion and overshooting , which gives large cores . here , we choose to apply the intermediate solution b ) , which means that the above equation 16 is only applied in fully radiative regions .",

    "( 2000 ) for their non  rotating stellar models .",

    "this results from the fact that , at sufficiently low rotation , the effect of rotation on the convective core mass overcomes the effect of helium diffusion in the envelope .",
    "indeed , for small rotation , the time required for helium mixing in the whole radiative envelope is very long , while hydrogen just needs to diffuse through a small amount of mass to reach the convective core .",

    "rotation induces also a scatter of the effective temperatures at the end of the ms . in reality , the dispersion results from both different initial velocities and also , for a given initial velocity , from different angles between the axis of rotation and the line of sight .",
    "indeed due to the von zeipel theorem ( @xcite ) the star appears bluer seen pole  on than equator  on . when integrated over the visible part of the star",
    ", the effects due to orientation can reach a few tenths of a magnitude in luminosity and a few hundredths in @xmath5 ( cf . maeder and peytreman 1970 ) .",

    "there is little difference between tracks with @xmath115 = 200 or 300 km s@xmath40 ( see also talon et al .",
    "if the effects behaved like @xmath139 , there would be larger differences .",
    "the present saturation effect occurs because outward transport of angular momentum by shears are larger when rotation is larger , also a larger rotation produces more mass loss , which makes a larger reduction of rotation during the evolution .",
    "let us note however that for some surface abundance ratios as n / c or n / o ( see table  1 ) , the increase from @xmath115 = 200 to 300 km",

    "rotation reduces the ms width in the high mass range ( m @xmath140 m@xmath39 ) .",
    "let us recall that when the mass increases , the ratio of the diffusion timescale for the chemical elements to the ms lifetime decreases ( maeder @xcite )",
    ". as a consequence , starting with the same @xmath115 on the zams , massive stars will be more mixed than low mass stars at an identical stage of their evolution .",
    "this reduces the ms width since greater chemical homogeneity makes the star bluer .",
    "moreover , due to both rotational mixing and mass loss , their surface will be rapidly enriched in h  burning products .",
    "these stars will therefore enter the wolf ",

    "we shall just mention one point of general interest here : for low or moderate rotation , the convective core shrinks as usual during ms evolution , while for high masses ( @xmath143 m@xmath0 ) and large initial rotations ( @xmath144 ) , the convective core grows in mass during evolution .",
    "this latter situation occurs in the fast rotating 60 m@xmath39 model shown on fig .",
    "these behaviours , i.e.  reduction or growth of the core , determine whether the star will follow respectively the usual redwards ms tracks in the hr diagram , or whether it will bifurcate to the blue ( cf .",

    "the stars with initial masses between 15 and 25 m@xmath39 become red supergiants ( rsg ) .",

    "burning lifetime is spent at @xmath145 .",
    "the behaviour of the rotating models results mainly from the enhancement of the mass loss rates .",
    "this effect prevents the formation of a big intermediate convective zone and therefore favours a rapid evolution toward the rsg phase ( stothers and chin @xcite ; maeder @xcite ) .",
    "let us note that the dispersion of the initial rotational velocities produces a mixing of the above behaviours .",
    "very interestingly , for the 12 m@xmath39 model a blue loop appears when rotation is included .",
    "this results from the higher luminosity of the rotating model .",
    "the higher luminosity implies that the outer envelope is more extended , and is thus characterized by lower temperatures and higher opacities at a given mass coordinate . as a consequence , in the rotating model during the first dredge  up , the outer convective zone proceeds much more deeply in mass than in the non  rotating star .",
    "typically in the non  rotating model the minimum mass coordinate reached by the outer convective zone is 6.6 m@xmath39 while in the rotating model it is 2.6 m@xmath39 .",
    "this prevents temporarily the extension in mass of the he  core and enables the apparition of a blue loop .",
    "indeed the lower the mass of the he ",

    "( @xcite , see also the discussion in maeder and meynet @xcite ) , a blue loop appears when the gravitational potential of the core @xmath146 is inferior to a critical potential @xmath147 depending only on the actual mass of the star which is about the same for the rotating and non  rotating model .",

    ", we may say that the rotation evolves almost like the case of simplified models , where the angular momentum is conserved locally .",
    "the large growth of the radius just implies a decrease of @xmath83 and of @xmath159 . later during the blue loops , where the cepheid instability strip is crossed , the rotation velocity becomes very large again and could easily become close to critical .",
    "this behaviour , also found by heger & langer ( 1998 ) , results from the stellar contraction which concentrates a large fraction of the angular momentum of the star ( previously contained in the extended convective envelope of the rsg ) in the outer few hundredths of a solar mass .",
    "this result suggests that rotation may also somehow influence the cepheid properties , in addition to the increase of stellar luminosity discussed above .",
    "amazingly , we notice that the stars with initially low mass loss during the ms phase , like for stars with m @xmath161 m@xmath0 , have more chance to reach the break  up velocities and thus huge mass loss than the more massive stars which lose a lot of mass on the ms .",
    "it is somehow surprising that little mass loss during the ms may favour large mass loss rates at the end of the ms phase .",
    "this may explain why stars close to break ",
    "up , like the be stars , do not form among the o  type stars , but mainly among the b  type stars , where we see that the ratio @xmath159 may increase during the ms phase .",
    "another related observation is the fact that the relative number of be  stars with respect to b  type stars is much higher in the lmc and smc than in the galaxy ( cf .",
    "maeder et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the lmc and smc , due to the lower metallicity ,",
    "the average mass loss rates are lower and thus these stars may keep higher rotation in general and thus form more be stars .",
    "this explanation does not exclude differences in the distribution of @xmath160 as well .      the evolution of @xmath83 in the hr diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ v_hr ] . starting with models having a velocity of 300 km s@xmath40 on the zero  age main sequence ,",
    "we give some lines of constant @xmath83 over the hr diagram . on the ms , we notice in particular that the decrease is much faster for the most massive stars than for stars with m @xmath162 15 m@xmath0 .",
    "this difference remains also present in the domain of b  supergiants . during the crossing of the hr diagram ,",
    "the rotational velocities decrease fastly , to become very small , i.e. of the order of a few km s@xmath40 , in the red supergiant phase .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to make detailed comparisons of the evolution of the distribution of the velocities over the hr diagram , however , we may notice a few points .",
    "the fact that the average @xmath163 is lower for o  type stars than for the early b  type stars ( slettebak , @xcite ) may be the consequence of the higher losses of mass and angular momentum in the most massive stars . also , we remark that the increase of @xmath163 from o  stars to b  stars is larger for the stars of luminosity class iv than for class v ( fukuda , @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with our models , which show ( cf . fig .",
    "[ v_hr ] ) that the differences of @xmath163 beween o and b  type stars are much larger at the end of the ms phase .",
    "another fact in the observed data is the strong decrease of @xmath163 for the massive supergiants of ob  types .",
    "this is predicted by all stellar models ( cf . also langer @xcite ) due to the growth of the stellar radii .",
    "further detailed comparisons may perhaps provide some new tests and constraints .",
    "the chemical abundances offer a very powerful test of internal evolution and they give strong evidences in favour of some additional mixing processes in massive stars .",
    "a review of the observations may be found in maeder and meynet ( 2000 ) .",
    "here we shall concentrate on the discussion of the theoretical results and we shall compare them with some recent observations .    the most striking feature appearing in tables  [ tbl-1 ] and [ tbl-2 ] as well as on fig .",
    "[ hrcn ] is the change of surface abundances in rotating stellar models ( cf .",
    "langer 1992 ) .",
    "the he , n  enrichments and the related c and o  depletions at the surface already occur on the ms .",
    "the more massive the star is , the more pronounced are the enrichments , supporting the expectation that mixing becomes more and more efficient when the mass increases ( maeder @xcite ) .",
    "the same is true when the initial rotational velocity increases . during the crossing of the hertzsprung ",
    "russel diagram , the evolution is sufficiently short for not allowing any important change of the surface abundances ( see fig .",
    "[ hrcn ] ) .",
    "further changes occur when the star becomes a red supergiant and undergoes the first dredge  up .",
    "in contrast , non  rotating stellar models show no change of the surface abundances until the first dredge  up in the red supergiant stage ( see table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that these models predict some enrichment neither during the ms nor in the blue supergiant phase unless a blue loop is formed .",
    "moreover , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ hrcn ] , the ratios obtained at the end of the he  burning phase are significantly lower than the ones obtained in rotating models .      fig .",
    "[ ysvit ] shows the evolution in the @xmath165 versus surface velocity plane where @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 being the abundances in number of helium and hydrogen at the surface .",
    "the theoretical tracks correspond to the equatorial velocities @xmath83 , while the observed points from herrero et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) are @xmath164 .",
    "this implies that the observed values are smaller on the average by a factor @xmath169 with respect to the theoretical values .    in fig .",

    "the higher initial mass , the greater the he  enrichments which can be reached during the ms .",
    "we see also that during the ms phase , for initial masses inferior to about 60 m@xmath39 , all the tracks with @xmath115 = 300 km s@xmath40 follow more or less the same @xmath165 versus @xmath83 relation .",
    "however , the relation is changed when the initial velocity is different ( see the fast rotating 20 and 60 m@xmath39 models ) .",
    "the surface he  enrichments on the ms generally depend on the following factors : the initial mass , the initial metallicity ( maeder & meynet 2000b ; meynet 2000a ) , the initial velocity and the age of the star .",
    "a low surface velocity at a given evolutionary stage does not exclude that in the past the star was a fast rotator .",
    "the slow rotation may result from the loss of angular momentum by stellar winds and/or from the increase of radius of the star . on the other hand ,",
    "a high velocity in the past implies he and n  enrichments of the surface .",
    "let us compare in fig .",
    "[ ysvit ] the theoretical tracks in the @xmath165 versus @xmath83 plane with the observations of ob stars performed by herrero et al .",

    "[ fgeff ] , there is little difference between the effective gravities at the pole and at the equator .",
    "indeed the ratio between these two gravities never exceeds 1.3 which means a vertical dispersion of about 0.1 dex in fig .",
    "rotating and rotating evolutionary tracks are superposed to the observed points in fig .",
    "[ fgeff ] . since most of the enriched stars are in the vicinity of the 120 and 60 m@xmath39 tracks ( see fig .  [ fgeff ] ) , we can wonder wether the changes of the surface abundances can be explained as an effect of mass loss only .",
    "it does not seem to be the case , because the part of the track shown on fig .",
    "[ fgeff ] for the non  rotating 60 m@xmath39 model presents no surface he  enrichment . in the case of the non  rotating 120 m@xmath39 model",
    "only the part of the track with @xmath4 inferior to 3.3 has @xmath172 .",

    "( @xcite , cf .",
    "also maeder 1987 ) . in the following",
    "we shall suppose that these enhancements are due to rotation .",
    "let us consider four groups of stars .",
    "in the first group we place all the stars presenting no he  enrichment at their surface ( @xmath173 ) and having @xmath174 km s@xmath40 ( empty squares on figs .",

    "the third group ( which is empty at present ) consists of the fast rotators with no he  enrichment .",
    "these stars would occupy the bottom right corner in fig .",
    "[ ysvit ] .",
    "finally , the fourth group contains the he  enriched stars with @xmath176 km s@xmath40 ( solid circles ) .",
    "* group 1 * the non  enriched stars with low rotation can be interpreted either as stars with small initial velocities or as young fast rotators whose surface has not yet been enriched in helium by rotational mixing ( see also herrero et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this respect",
    "let us mention that all the stars having @xmath177 , and which therefore are probably not too evolved , present no he  enrichment .",
    "* group 2 * the most striking feature of the second group of stars ( @xmath178 and @xmath179 km s@xmath40 ) is the fact that they are distributed in a relatively narrow range of @xmath180 between 80 and 160 km s@xmath40 .",
    "this may result from the following facts : firstly there exists a minimum value of the initial velocity for rotational mixing to be able to drive changes of the helium surface abundances during the h  burning phase .",
    "secondly the observed distribution also reflects the way the surface velocity declines during the h  burning phase and the narrow range of observed velocities may result from some convergence effect as the one mentionned in sect .",
    "6.1 ( see also fig .",
    "we see that the high @xmath165 values reached by some of these stars ( superior to @xmath20.16 ) would be compatible with their high initial mass implied from their position in fig .",
    "[ fgeff ] .",
    "* group 3 * very interestingly no stars are observed with a @xmath181 km s@xmath40 and no he  enrichment . keeping in mind that the observed stars do not represent a statistical complete sample ,",
    "one can nevertheless wonder why no stars are observed in this zone .",
    "a possibility would be that these very fast rotators do not exist , but this is not realistic .",
    "indeed stars with velocities as high as 300 km s@xmath40 and more have been observed on the ms ( e.g. penny @xcite ; howarth et al .",
    "@xcite ; see also fig .",

    "[ ysvit ] ) ?",
    "these stars are likely the descendants of very fast ms rotating stars ( see the discussion in the subsection group 4 below ) .    the fact that no stars are observed in the group 3 may indicate that the change of the surface abundances occur within a small fraction of the visible ms life . for the fast rotating 60 m@xmath39 model plotted on fig .",
    "[ ysvit ] , the surface retains its initial composition ( @xmath182 ) only during a third of its h  burning lifetime .",
    "more rapidly rotating models would still reduce the fraction of the ms time spent with no change of the surface abundances .",
    "the lack of fast rotators with normal surface composition may be due to the fact that young massive fast rotators are still embedded in the cloud from which they formed .",
    "the models of massive star formation with accretion ( bernasconi and maeder @xcite ) indicate that when the stars become visible , they have already burnt some fraction of their central hydrogen , thus some transport of he and n to the stellar surface may have occured .",
    "* group 4 * could the stars belonging to the fourth group ( @xmath178 and @xmath181 km/ s ) be formed by stars previously in the low velocity range and which have been accelerated for instance by contraction on a blue loop  ?",
    "the answer is likely no .",
    "indeed blue loops can not accelerate the surface beyond the critical velocity which , for a 12 m@xmath39 blue supergiant at the tip of a blue loop , is of the order of 250 km s@xmath40 . in addition",
    "some stars in the group 4 are classified as ms stars ( see the stars labeled with a v on figs .  [ ysvit ] and [ fgeff ] ) .",
    "another possibility would be to consider the stars in group 4 as secondary stars in close binary systems which would have been accelerated through the process of mass accretion ? but these stars are not observed to belong to binary systems . therefore the most reasonable hypothesis is to consider the stars in group 4 as the natural descendants of very fast ms rotating stars .",
    "their chemical enrichment at the surface is very fast .",
    "their chemical structure as a result of the strong rotational mixing is probably near homogeneity .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that high values of @xmath164 are observed for very high values of @xmath165 implying that the surface velocity does not decrease too much in the course of the evolution .",
    "this can be accounted for if the star remains compact , _",
    "i.e. _ in the blue part of the hr diagram as is the case for a strongly mixed star ( maeder @xcite ; see also the fast rotating 60 m@xmath39 track in fig .",
    "[ ysvit ] ) .",
    "another effect could also be important in that respect , _",
    "i.e. _ the anisotropy of the stellar winds when stars are rotating near break  up . for the hot stars",
    ", the von zeipel ( @xcite ) theorem implies that most of the mass is ejected from the pole ( maeder @xcite ) .",
    "this prevents the loss of important angular momentum and maintains a high surface velocity .",
    "if the stars in the fourth group are nearly homogeneous objects , one would expect higher effective gravities than observed .",
    "typically , the fast rotating well mixed 60 m@xmath39 model remains at a high value of @xmath4 , at least for the portion of the evolution computed here ( see fig .",
    "[ fgeff ] ) .",
    "moreover , as noted above , the maximum dispersion in @xmath4 due to orientation effects is around 0.1 dex .",
    "could the @xmath4 be underestimated ?",
    "even if it is difficult on the base of the present data to ascertain such a point of view , one can note that the @xmath183 for these fast rotating stars can not be too far from 1 , otherwise one would obtain surface velocities above the break  up value .",
    "this means that these stars are seen essentially equator  on .",
    "the @xmath184 in the equator band is inferior to the surface averaged @xmath184 and thus the observed @xmath184 might be underestimated .",
    "of course a quantitative analysis requires a detailed study of how the variation of @xmath184 with the latitude affects the spectroscopically determined gravities .",
    "most blue supergiants present surface enrichments . for instance , walborn ( @xcite , @xcite ) showed that ordinary ob supergiants have he and n enrichments as a result of cno processing .",
    "only the small group of peculiar obc  stars has the normal cosmic abundance ratios ( cf . also howarth and prinja @xcite ; herrero et al .",
    "@xcite ; gies and lambert @xcite ; lennon @xcite ) . a possibility to explain the he and n  enrichments in supergiants would be that blue supergiants are on a blue loop after a first red supergiant stage where dredge  up has occurred producing the observed surface enrichments .",
    "however as we shall see below , this does not appear as the good explanantion at least for some of the observed enrichments .",

    "n / c from the zams to the red supergiant stage for stars in the mass range from 9 to 20 m@xmath0 .",
    "the n / c ratio appears as the most sensitive observable parameter . for non  rotating stars , the surface enrichment in nitrogen only occurs when the star reaches the red supergiant phase ; there , cno elements are dredged  up by deep convection .",
    "the behaviour is the same as for the he ",
    "enrichments discussed above . for rotating stars ,",
    "n  excesses already occur during the ms phase and they are larger for higher rotation and initial stellar masses . at the end of the ms phase of the 12 m@xmath39 model , the n / c ratio is enhanced by factors 2.4 and 4.3 for @xmath115 = 200 and 300 km s@xmath40 respectively .",
    "these factors are increased up to 4 and 7.1 for the 20 m@xmath39 models with the same @xmath115 .    on fig .",

    "we plot here the smaller `` lte '' ratios since , for the stars in common with the lennon sample , they are similar to lennon s results ( see the discussion in venn @xcite ) . from the positions of the observed stars in the @xmath4 versus @xmath5 diagram , one obtains that the range of initial masses for the a  type supergiants shown on fig .",
    "[ nh ] are between 5 and 20 m@xmath39 .    from fig .",
    "[ nh ] , one notes first that at the @xmath21 of the observed supergiants , non  rotating stellar models predict no enrichment at all unless there is a blue loop .",
    "however it is not likely that all the observed points are at the tip of a blue loop .",
    "indeed some of the stars have initial masses above 15 m@xmath39 and , at solar metallicity , current grids of models ( arnett @xcite ; schaller et al .",
    "@xcite ; alongi et al .",
    "@xcite ; brocato and castellani @xcite ) only predict blue loops for masses equal or lower than 15 m@xmath39 .",
    "moreover many of the observed stars have n / c ratios too low to result from a first dredge  up episode ( see for instance the position of the blue loop of the non  rotating 9 m@xmath39 model in fig .",
    "[ nh ] ) . therefore venn ( @xcite ) suggested that at least those stars presenting the lowest n / c ratios are on their way from the ms to the red giant branch and have undergone some mixing in the early stage of their evolution .",
    "if such stars are not at all accounted for by standard evolutionary tracks , rotating models can naturally reproduce their observed surface abundances as can be seen on fig.[nh ] .",
