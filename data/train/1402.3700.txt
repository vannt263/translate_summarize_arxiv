    "outflows ( or winds ) are likely to be a natural and unavoidable result of the accretion process ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in active galactic nuclei ( agn )",
    "the feedback associated with outflowing matter is believed to play an important role in shaping the co - evolution of the central massive black hole and the host galaxy ( @xcite ) , plausibly leading to the observed agn ",
    "host - galaxy relationships , e.g. , @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a number of massive ( @xmath10 ) , high - velocity ( @xmath11c ) outflows , as revealed through the presence of blue - shifted fek absorption at @xmath12kev in the rest - frame , have been found in luminous agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the large wind velocity  which indicates an origin directly associated with the accretion disk , hence leading them to be dubbed ` disk - winds'implies that the wind may be energetically significant in terms of feedback ( i.e. , @xmath13 , @xcite ) .    nonetheless , one key determination currently lacking is a direct measurement of the wind location with respect to the central black hole , which is of fundamental importance when it comes to determining the wind energetics .",
    "previous studies of the disk - wind phenomenon have employed simple geometric and kinematic relations to constrain the location of the absorbing gas ( e.g. , see @xcite for an outline of these arguments ) , but these arguments can lead to considerable uncertainties on the gas location which makes it difficult to confidently determine the wind energetics . the best way to overcome these limitations it to directly determine the location of the absorbing gas by establishing how it varies over short time - scales . however , whilst such line - variability has sometimes been observed in soft x - ray grating spectra below @xmath14kev , hence leading to robust constraints on the location of the soft x - ray warm absorber in a number of agn , e.g. , in mrk509 ( @xcite ) and mr2251 - 178 ( @xcite ) , to date it has proven much more difficult to measure the necessary line variability at harder x - ray energies ( i.e. , @xmath12kev ) where modern detectors tend to be less sensitive ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we overcome these limitations and report the first direct constraints on the location of a high - velocity fek disk - wind , as measured in the powerful quasar pds456 .",
    "pds456 ( @xmath0 ) is a luminous ( @xmath15 ; @xcite ) radio - quiet quasar which harbours one of the most powerful fek disk - winds currently known ( @xcite , hereafter ` r09 ' ) .",
    "first found the x - ray spectrum to be absorbed at @xmath12kev in 2001 , with the absorption attributable to highly - ionised iron ( @xcite ) . a subsequent observation in 2007 revealed two highly significant absorption lines at @xmath16 and @xmath17kev in the quasar rest - frame ( r09 ) .",
    "these lines are most likely associated with resonant absorption from  and  , which hence implies an outflow velocity in the range @xmath18c ( r09 ) . in a more recent observation ( 2011 )",
    "we again found a broad absorption trough at @xmath19kev in the source rest - frame ( reeves et al .",
    "2013 , hereafter ` r13 ' ) , and we found that the absorption in both 2007 and 2011 could be due to the same flow of gas which is in photo - ionization equilibrium with the emergent x - ray emission .",
    "however , due to the large time difference between the observations , direct constraints could not be placed on the radial location of the absorbing gas .",
    "even so , we were able to describe the absorption in both observations using the self - consistent disk - wind models of @xcite , hence showing the variable wind profile to be consistent with a radiatively - driven flow launched from the inner accretion disk ( r13 ) .    in this paper",
    "we report the first results from our extensive observational campaign of pds456 with the , and satellites in 2013 ( feb  sept ) . here",
    ", we focus specifically on characterising the remarkable spectral variability exhibited by the fek wind during the new long observation ( feb  mar 2013 ) , and use this variability to place the first direct constraints on the wind location . a full spectral analysis of both these data and the accompanying contemporaneous and campaign will be presented in forthcoming work .",
    "( @xcite ) observed pds456 at the aim - point of the x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis ; @xcite ) . due to scheduling constraints the observation comprised three sequences : the first ( obsid : 707035010 , hereafter 2013a ) has a duration of @xmath20441ks and was obtained between 2126 feb 2013 , whilst the second ( obsid : 707035020 , hereafter 2013b ) and third ( obsid : 707035030 ; hereafter 2013c ) were obtained consecutively between 311 march 2013 and have durations of @xmath20404ks and @xmath20245ks , respectively .",

    "the data are unfolded against a simple @xmath45 power - law model and uncorrected for galactic absorption .",
    "it is apparent from figure  [ fig : eeuf_comparison ] that all of the 2013 sequences are reasonably hard ( @xmath46 between @xmath47kev , compared to @xmath48 in 2007 ) , with a spectral shape reminiscent of ( but still harder than ) that seen in the absorbed 2011 observation ( r13 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray flux is much lower in 2013 than in the relatively unabsorbed 2007 observation ( r09 , r13 ) , with a mean @xmath49 in 2013 compared to @xmath50 in 2007 , whilst @xmath51 is also lower ( see table  [ tab : observation_details ] ) .",
    "these factors suggest that pds456 is again heavily absorbed during the 2013 epoch .",

    "the remainder of this work focusses on characterising this absorption in greater detail .    in order to probe the absorption system it was first necessary to parametrise the continuum .",
    "we find that a partially - covered absorption model provides a good simultaneous fit to the three 2013 sequences . in summary , and noting that a fully detailed spectral de - composition of these data is to be presented in subsequent work , we parametrise the continuum with a phenomenological model of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 ( @xcite ) accounts for the galactic absorption column density of @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the underlying power - law continuum , @xmath56 are two neutral partially - covering absorbers , and the @xmath57 is an ad - hoc black - body with @xmath58ev that provides some necessary soft emission at @xmath59kev . this soft component may be associated with the reprocessed emission from the outer wind , e.g. , similar to what is seen in some wind - dominated ultra - luminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources ( @xcite ) , with the intrinsic emission of the accretion disc , or have another origin . for simplicity ,",
    "we opt to not absorb the component with the partially - covering gas to prevent degeneracies between its normalization and the gas covering fraction .",
    "we note , however , that an equivalent description of the data can be achieved if the is absorbed ; the ensued parameters for the fek absorption are also unaffected by how the soft component is modelled . a full discussion regarding the origin of the soft component is deferred to future work .",
    "the @xmath60 component in our baseline model corresponds to the broad ionised emission line at @xmath61kev ( rest - frame ) , which might be associated with light scattered from the disk - wind ( see r13 for a discussion ) ; we fit this broad profile with a ( fixed ) width of @xmath62ev , as found for the 2011 observation by r13 .",
    "we adopt assume a ( fixed ) power - law slope of @xmath63 to ensure consistency with both the bright ( unabsorbed ) 2007 observation ( r09 ) and the new hard x - ray spectrum ( which will be presented in subsequent work ) .",
    "allowing @xmath64 free to vary from this value does not result in a statistical improvement to the fit .",
    "we account for the changes in intra - sequence curvature by allowing the covering fraction ( @xmath65 ) of the partially - covering absorbers to vary freely ; covering fractions of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , for tied column densities of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , are sufficient to model all three sequences .",
    "note that whilst we do not discuss the physical nature of the partially - covering gas in detail here , it could plausibly be associated with either clumps within a disk - wind ( e.g. , r13 ) or possibly with clouds in the more extended broad line region ( blr ) ( e.g. , as has been suggested in ngc1365 , @xcite ; mrk766 , @xcite and mr2251 - 178 , @xcite ) .",
    "full parameters for the baseline model are noted in table  [ tab : baseline_model ] .",
    "in general , this simple phenomenological model is consistent with that employed by r13 to jointly describe the 2007 and 2011 observations , and we find that it again provides a good account of the spectral shape in 2013 .",
    "the full fit statistic between @xmath38kev is @xmath70 , with the strong absorption in the fek band being the main deviation from the continuum model ( see figure  [ fig : eeuf_sequences ] , panels d  f ) .",

    "we can use the definition of the ionization parameter , @xmath242 ( @xcite ) , to estimate the distance , @xmath243 , of the the absorber from the ionising continuum source . here , @xmath244 is the integrated ionising luminosity between @xmath245 rydbergs . as it is unclear whether or not the partially - covering gas is shielding the outflow we should consider both the absorbed and unabsorbed ionising luminosities , corresponding to the wind being shielded and unshielded by the partial coverer , respectively , to give the likely range in luminosity ` seen ' by the absorbing material .",
    "to first order we can estimate @xmath244 by extrapolating our continuum model into the uv regime .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that estimating @xmath244 in this manner will probably lead an under - estimate of the _ true _ ionising luminosity because it neglects the excess contribution from the uv .    to roughly gauge how strongly the uv emission is pds456 is likely to contribute to @xmath244 we can compare the flux predicted by our baseline x - ray model to the uv flux reported by @xcite .",
    "an extrapolation of the @xmath63 x - ray model predicts a @xmath246 flux a factor of @xmath216 lower than observed by the hubble space telescope in the same wavelength range ( see @xcite ) . the discrepancy can be accounted for with a rudimentary break in the uv - to - x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , hardening from @xmath247 in the uv to @xmath248 in the x - ray ( for an @xmath249ev ) , which increases the total inferred ionising luminosity by a factor of @xmath216 .",
    "even so , because this increase occurs predominantly in the uv regime it will essentially have no effect at fek where the ionization potential is significantly larger than the typical uv photon energy , i.e. , @xmath19kev for . moreover , while @xmath244 will undoubtedly increase , the value for @xmath119 inferred by will also increase in proportion , so the overall ratio @xmath250 remains roughly constant ( see fig .  9 in @xcite and discussion therein ) .",
    "thus , because there is no net effect of accounting for the uv break in these data , we can safely estimate @xmath244 based on our extrapolated x - ray model .",
    "this leads to @xmath251 in the shielded ",
    "unshielded cases ( corrected for galactic absorption in both cases ) .",
    "thus , for a mean @xmath232 , and remembering that electron density ( @xmath222 ) is related to the gas density ( @xmath252 ) by the relation @xmath253 , we have @xmath254 , or @xmath255pc . for a @xmath256appropriate for pds456 ( r09 , r13 )",
    ", this corresponds to a radius of @xmath257  from the black hole .",
    "this is comparable with inner regions of the broad line region ( blr ) , at the order of @xmath258  ( @xcite , r09 ) from the black hole .",
    "however , we note that this estimate is likely only the characteristic radius for the responding material . should the outflow be stratified along the los ( e.g. , as in @xcite ) there could still be material over a large extended range of radii .      in the second scenario ( our model b ) we showed that the absorption could also be modelled with a column density which increases from @xmath259 to a maximum @xmath260 over the course of the observation , with a constant @xmath261 .",
    "detailed simulations of accretion disk winds have shown that their ejecta are often clumpy , with a complex density structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if changes in column density are indeed responsible for the observed line variability in pds456 , one possibility is that the changes could be associated with an inhomogeneous clump of material within a disk - wind .",
    "alternatively , the clump could originate in an outburst of material being blown from the disk surface during the flaring period .",
    "regardless of its origin , the linear extent ( diameter ) of a transiting clump can be estimated from @xmath262 , where @xmath263 is the cloud velocity tangential to the los and @xmath264 is the total duration of the transit . taking @xmath265ks , corresponding to twice the time between the first definitive detection of the absorption in slice 5 and it reaching its maximum depth in slice 7 , and making the reasonable assumption that @xmath266c",
    ", we estimate @xmath267 cm ( or @xmath268  in pds456 ) .",
    "taking @xmath269 ( as measured in slice 7 when the absorption was deepest ) , and assuming that the absorbing cloud is spherically symmetric , we can then infer its density as @xmath270 .",
    "this then leads to @xmath271 , depending upon whether the outflow is shielded or not .",
    "overall , the inferred wind properties are consistent with those posited by r13 after applying the @xcite disk - wind model to the 20072011 spectra .",
    "we also note the similarity between our estimated parameters for the wind and those recently predicted for a time - variable disk - wind by @xcite . on the basis of r - mhd simulations @xcite show that a continuum - driven disk - wind can become significantly clumpy or filamentary at @xmath272  from the black hole , with the clumps having an optical depth @xmath273 of order unity , an ionization parameter @xmath274and an observational variability time - scale of roughly one week .",
    "these values are similar to those found here for our model b.",
    "therefore the outflow in pds456 is constrained to lie between @xmath275  from the black - hole , depending upon the model adopted and whether the gas is shielded .",
    "we now consider the energetics associated with such a wind .",
    "we first calculate the mass outflow rate using the expression @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is a parameter which sets the overall wind geometry ( in terms of the solid angle ) .",
    "this equation is the same as the one derived by @xcite , with @xmath278 being identical to their case of a vertically launched bi - conical wind with solar abundances that has an average angle of @xmath279 with respect to the los ( see @xcite for details ) . because @xmath280 we consider here only the most conservative estimate of @xmath281  as this will lead to a similarly conservative estimate on the wind energetics . as an aside it is also important to note that the two limiting cases that we have considered in this work , i.e. , that the wind is either shielded or unshielded from the full ionising continuum by the partially - covering gas , are likely to represent the absolute extreme scenarios . in the former case , should the shielding gas be ionised rather than neutral ( as has been assumed here for simplicity ) then the reduced gas opacity ( and hence enhanced transmission ) will allow a larger fraction of @xmath244 to be ` seen ' by the wind , leading to a larger inferred distance @xmath243 .",
    "the lower estimate of @xmath282considered here should therefore be regarded as extremely conservative ; if a larger estimate on @xmath243 was adopted instead then the subsequent energetics will be correspondingly larger .",
    "thus , for a mean @xmath283 ( taken over slices 48 ) appropriate for our model b , taking @xmath284 cm , and adopting @xmath285c , we conservatively estimate that @xmath286 in pds456 .",
    "this can informatively be written in terms of the eddington mass accretion rate , @xmath287 , where @xmath288is the eddington luminosity and @xmath289 is the accretion efficiency of the black hole . for our estimate on the mass outflow rate",
    "we find @xmath290 , which implies that the mass outflow rate is at least @xmath8 of the eddington accretion rate for a reasonable @xmath291 .",
    "similarly , we can estimate the wind kinetic luminosity in eddington units as @xmath292 , whilst the momentum rate of the flow is given by @xmath293 .",
    "for the values appropriate here , i.e. , @xmath294and @xmath295c , we hence estimate @xmath296 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath297which larger than the typical @xmath298 of @xmath299@xmath300 in pds456 ; @xcite ) thought necessary for significant feedback ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the momentum rate in the flow is comparable to that expected for the eddington - limited photon field , i.e. , @xmath301 , which strongly suggests that the wind was radiatively - accelerated by continuum - scattering processes and/or radiation pressure during an episode of near - eddington - limited accretion , as has been argued by @xcite .",
    "ultimately , whilst the overall wind energetics are likely sensitive to the overall flow geometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) , these results imply a total integrated energy budget in the wind of @xmath302erg , for a representative quasar active phase of @xmath303yr with a @xmath304 duty cycle . thus , even in the _ most conservative case _ , the wind in pds456 could plausibly impart sufficient energy into the host galaxy to exceed the @xmath305erg binding energy of a mass @xmath306galaxy bulge ( with @xmath307 ) .",
    "this supports the argument that the fek wind in pds456  and by extension those also observed in the wider agn population ( e.g. , @xcite )  may play an important role in shaping the host galaxy through feedback .",
    "through this work we have shown that despite the gradually increasing absorption at @xmath19kev ( rest - frame ) being a defining characteristic of the last @xmath1ms of the 2013 observation , the same absorption does not appear to be strongly present during the first @xmath308ks .",
    "this raises an interesting question : where was the absorption at the start of the observation ?",
    "we speculate briefly as to the reason for this on the basis of our two different absorption geometries .",
    "if the absorption is due to gas in photo - ionization equilibrium one possibility is that it is simply too highly ionised at the start of the observation to be observable in the spectrum .",
    "the light - curve ( figure  [ fig : lc_slices ] ) shows that slice  1 traces a factor of @xmath309 decrease in source flux , perhaps following an even earlier flaring event .",
    "if this is the case then the gas , having already been ionised by an earlier flare , may not have had time to sufficiently recombine into an observable feature before subsequently being re - ionised by the strong flare in slice  4 .",
    "after slice  4 , where there are no further strong flares , the gas may then have ample time to recombine , eventually giving rise to the the observed deep feature in slices  78 .",
    "alternatively , should the absorption instead be due to a transiting inhomogeneous clump of gas , it is possible that the gas may not be present along the los at the start of observation . the onset of the absorption is first apparent in slice  4 which makes it tempting to speculate that the absorbing clump may be in some way related to the flare , perhaps , for example , being blown off of the disk by magnetic flaring in the comptonizing corona and then further accelerated to high velocity by continuum scattering .",
    "note that the observed outflow velocity of the gas corresponds to an escape radius of @xmath310from the black hole .",
    "we could therefore be seeing the gas close to where it was launched from the disc , which lends weight to the idea that the absorption could be due to a clump of gas which occults the los .",
    "this paper presents the first results from an extensive , and observing campaign of powerful quasar pds456 , occurring between feb ",
    "sept 2013 .",
    "we have reported on the remarkably variable high - velocity fek - shell wind which is evident in the new long ( @xmath1ms duration ) observation .",
    "consistent with earlier ( 2007 , 2011 ) observations , the wind is again detected through absorption at @xmath19kev in the source rest - frame ( @xmath311c ) .",
    "the absorption line depth increase by a factor of @xmath2 during the new observation .",
    "this variability is equally well modelled by ( i ) an outflow in photo - ionization equilibrium which recombines in response to decreasing source flux , or ( ii ) an inhomogeneous clump of gas which transits the line - of - sight to the quasar .",
    "the variability allows us to directly determine the radius to the gas , e.g. , as part of a clumpy outflow , which is constrained to lie between @xmath312of the black hole . even in the most conservative case ,",
    "the kinetic power of the flow is a significant fraction ( @xmath7 ) of the eddington luminosity , and is comparable to the @xmath298 of @xmath299 thought necessary for significant feedback .",
    "the momentum rate of the flow is equivalent to the eddington momentum rate which is consistent with the flow being radiatively - accelerated by electron scattering during a near - eddington - limited accretion episode .",
