    "a set of experimental data is almost always presented in terms of the subset of interesting events , called the signal , and a complimentary subset of events from non - interesting sources , called the background .",
    "the fraction of events from each subset is a binomial quantity ; some fraction of the sample is either characterized as signal or it is not .",
    "there is usually no exact means of separating signal events from background events .",
    "instead an experimental cut is imposed on the original sample .",
    "such a cut is motivated by independent studies that imply the cut will be more efficient for the events of interest than for the non - interesting events .",
    "after this cut is applied , estimates are made regarding the amount of signal and background in these new binomial subsets : those events that survived the cut , and those that failed the cut .",
    "the attempt to rotate data from the experimental axis in pass - fail space onto the physics axis that defines signal - background space is referred to in this paper as the measurement problem .",
    "the measurement problem is introduced and described in section  [ sec - meas_prob ] .",
    "the classical treatment of the measurement problem as a system of linear equations provides some insight into the practical business of analyzing data , but it is found to be inadequate for the construction of confidence intervals .",
    "a bayesian analysis of related binomial quantities provides a straightforward solution to this problem .",
    "bayesian descriptions of binomial data are given in section  [ sec - tutorial ] .",
    "a full solution to the measurement problem is found in section  [ sec - mysolution ] .",
    "the solution of section  [ sec - mysolution ] provides a result in terms of the fraction of signal events in the entire original sample ; section  [ sec - spass ] reformulates this solution so that the result can be presented as a fraction of signal events in the subset of events that passed the cut .",
    "the methods introduced in sections  [ sec - mysolution ] and  [ sec - spass ] are demonstrated in example 1 with the data used for the discovery of the top quark .",
    "example 2 describes one way to use this method to estimate the necessary size of control samples in order to understand the background to inclusive @xmath1 production .",
    "section  [ sec - discovery ] presents a formalism for calculating the minimum number of events which must survive a cut designed to enhance the significance of a possible signal over expectations .",
    "section  [ sec - xcheck ] describes how to use the measurement problem to attribute a level of confidence in the consistency of a possible new discovery with the original understanding of the expected backgrounds .",
    "examples 3 and 4 illustrate the methods of sections  [ sec - discovery ] and  [ sec - xcheck ] using published @xmath2 results .",
    "example 5 extrapolates this tevatron run 1 data to the estimated amount of data available for a similar analysis in run 2 .",
    "the measurement problem is equivalent to taking data that is recorded on an experimental axis , _ i.e. _  pass - fail space , and rotating the experimental results onto a physics axis , _ i.e. _  signal - background space .",
    "when a cut is imposed on a data sample of @xmath3 events , the sample is then divided into a subset of events which pass the cut @xmath4 , and a subset of events which fail the cut @xmath5 , @xmath6 the original sample can also be described as a subset of signal @xmath7 and background @xmath8 events , @xmath9 the different axes are related through a measurement matrix @xmath10 , @xmath11    the measurement problem is to invert the matrix @xmath10 such that @xmath12 where the elements of the measurement matrix are the efficiencies of the cut on the signal and the background , @xmath13    the efficiency @xmath14 of the cut on the signal is defined as the number of signal events that will pass the cut , @xmath15 , divided by the total number of signal events in the original sample ; the number of signal events which will fail the cut @xmath16 is the total number of signal events times the inefficiency ( @xmath17 ) :    @xmath18    the efficiency @xmath14 is always evaluated from some independent control sample of @xmath19 diagnostic events , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) diagnostic events pass ( fail ) the cut ;    @xmath22    similarly the efficiency of the cut on the background @xmath23 , referred to as the ` rfficiency ' , is defined as the number of background events that will pass the cut @xmath24 divided by the total number of background events in the original sample , while the number of background events which will fail the cut @xmath25 is the total number of background events times the ` inrfficiency ' ( @xmath26 ) :    @xmath27    just as the efficiency is evaluated from an independent diagnostic sample , the rfficiency comes from another independent sample of @xmath28 events where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) diagnostic events pass ( fail ) the cut ;    @xmath31    it is common to refer to the rejection factor @xmath32 of a cut as the ratio of the different efficiencies @xmath33 while the enhancement @xmath34 of a cut on a given sample can be defined as @xmath35    the inverse measurement matrix @xmath36 , @xmath37 exists only if the determinant of matrix @xmath10 is not equal to zero , which is true whenever @xmath38 .",
    "this requirement is naturally satisfied whenever the rejection factor is not equal to one or the enhancement is non - zero . usually a cut is chosen such that @xmath39 there is nothing in this formalism which prevents the choice of a cut such that @xmath40 ; this is the situation where the background is enhanced at the expense of the signal .    once the inverse measurement matrix is known , it is possible to describe the number of signal ( or background ) events in terms of the number of events which pass ( or fail ) the cut :    @xmath41    in fractional terms , defining    @xmath42    then    @xmath43    or    @xmath44    the fraction of events which pass the cut @xmath45 will always be found in the interval @xmath46 , and it is natural to restrict the fraction of signal events in the total sample @xmath47 to the same interval .",
    "practically this means that a physical solution to the measurement problem exists only if @xmath48 .",
    "if the fraction of events that pass the cut is greater than the efficiency or less than the rfficiency , then the estimates of @xmath49 and @xmath23 need to be reevaluated , as they are almost certainly incorrect .",
    "it is possible that there is more than one background present in the original sample , and that a cut has different rfficiencies for different backgrounds , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath50 such problems can always be reduced to the form @xmath51 where the total rfficiency @xmath52 is the weighted sum of the individual rfficiencies , @xmath53 the weights @xmath54 are the fractional amounts of the total background due to the individual backgrounds ,    @xmath55    this allows all problems to be reduced to the case of one signal source and one non - signal source , _ i.e. _  one background .",
    "the solution of the measurement problem can be approached from a purely algebraic viewpoint .",
    "if @xmath56 is a vector representing the experimental basis , with pass and fail axes , and @xmath57 is the vector representing the physics basis , with signal and background axes , the measurement problem is written @xmath58 .",
    "when there are uncertainties in either of the basis vectors , or in the measurement matrix , the measurement problem is written @xmath59 finding the solution @xmath57 with uncertainty @xmath60 is a classic problem in linear algebra .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath60 is known  @xcite to be limited : @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the norm of a vector ( or matrix ) and @xmath63 is a non - negative real scalar known as the condition number of the measurement matrix @xmath10 , @xmath64    if @xmath65 is large , the measurement problem is said to be ill - conditioned .",
    "the condition number is equivalent for both the maximum absolute column sum ( the @xmath66-norm ) and the maximum absolute row sum ( the @xmath67-norm ) of the measurement matrix , subject to the constraints of equation  [ eq : erchoose ] : @xmath68    the only way to avoid a measurement matrix with a large condition number is to avoid @xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "large rejection factors lead to better conditioned measurement problems ; better conditioned measurement problems lead to a smaller uncertainty @xmath70 in the quantities on the physics axis @xmath57 .",
    "there are many different funtions of @xmath14 and @xmath23 that can be offered as a statistic to weigh the relative merit of one particular cut ( with @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) versus another cut ( with @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "minimizing @xmath65 of equation  [ eq : def_gammam ] is only one strategy that can be used to search for a ` best ' set of cuts .",
    "one other strategy may be to maximize the rejection factor @xmath32 of equation  [ eq : rej_factor ] .",
    "another commonly encountered rule - of - thumb is to maximize @xmath75 ; the extra factor of @xmath14 is introduced to account for the fact that the amount of signal in the subset of @xmath4 events is directly proportional to @xmath14 , cf .",
    "equation  [ eq : signals ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : erplot ] shows the behavior of these statistics for the cases @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "each is undefined for cases of @xmath78 .",
    "notice that strategies that rely on minimizing @xmath65 see the relatively biggest improvement quickly as @xmath23 takes values away from @xmath14 , but that a strategy of maximizing the rejection factor sees the most improvement as @xmath23 approaches 0 , independent of the actual value of @xmath14 . as expected ,",
    "both methods favor values of @xmath14 closer to one than to zero .",
    "none of these minimization or maximization strategies takes into account any uncertainties in the state - of - knowledge of @xmath14 or @xmath23 , so none of them can be considered an absolute statistic in deciding between one cut or another .",
    "while the linear algebra used to derive equation  [ eq : inequality ] provides some insight into the measurement problem , ultimately it is unsatisfying in several respects .",
    "the most obvious limitation is that the upper limit on @xmath70 is not clearly defined in terms of confidence intervals .",
    "another drawback is that there are several possible choices for the norm of the measurement matrix @xmath10 and the uncertainty @xmath79 .",
    "yet another difficulty is the common confusion that arises from attempts to assign uncertainties to a binomial measurement , such as what fraction of events pass or fail a cut .",
    "bayesian probability theory provides a natural way to incorporate the knowledge , including the uncertainties , of the efficiency , the rfficiency , and the measured experimental results @xmath45 into a coherent statement about the state of knowledge of the physical signal fraction @xmath47 . before describing the details of the solution to the measurement problem",
    ", the basics of bayesian probability theory will be reviewed by considering its application towards binomial efficiencies .",
    "bayesian probability theory ( bpt ) interprets a posterior probability density function ( pdf ) as the state - of - knowledge of an experimental result given some set of prior beliefs in the possible values of the result , the prior pdf , and the likelihood function describing the measured results of the experiment .",
    "the source of the posterior is bayes theorem : @xmath80 the maximum value of the posterior pdf is the most likely value , and the area beneath a particular interval along the posterior corresponds to the confidence that the true answer lies within the limits of that interval .",
    "a common problem encountered in the analysis of experimental results that is naturally described by bpt is the characterization of the uncertainties associated with the fraction of events that pass a particular cut @xmath45 .",
    "it has long been known that binomially distributed quantities can be approximated by the normal ( gaussian ) distribution ,    @xmath81    the most likely value of the normal pdf is @xmath82 , and the variance is @xmath83 .",
    "this approximation is only valid when @xmath84 and the mean @xmath85 is not too close to the extreme values of one or zero .",
    "as @xmath85 approaches one or zero , the variance ( as defined ) approaches zero .",
    "it is not uncommon in experimental physics that one or both of these conditions is violated , leaving the approximation of equation  [ eq : gaussian ] unusable . in particular , experimental results often present cases where zero events remain after a set of cuts",
    "is applied to a data sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : posteriors]a shows normally distributed pdfs with the same @xmath85 but with different sample sizes @xmath3 . note that the tails of the gaussian distribution can extend beyond the physical region @xmath46 .",
    "several authors  @xcite  @xcite have used the following posterior pdf to describe @xmath86 in the interval @xmath87 : @xmath88 the most likely value for this posterior is simply the fraction of events that pass the cut , @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ fig : posteriors]b shows equation  [ eq : dap ] for different values of @xmath3 , each with the same most likely value of @xmath89 .",
    "the origin of this posterior is the use of a uniform prior over the physical region , @xmath90 the experimental likelihood is the binomial distribution , @xmath91 the evidence , or marginalization term , normalizes the posterior to unit area , and is found by integration : @xmath92 in the case of the uniform prior , the evidence term for this experimental likelihood distribution is equal to @xmath93 .",
    "it is possible to construct a different posterior pdf @xmath86 with a different choice of prior , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath94 arises if jeffreys ( divergent ) prior is used : @xmath95 the evidence term in this case is equal to @xmath96 .",
    "the most likely value of equation  [ eq : jeffreys ] is @xmath97 , which approximates the most likely values of equations  [ eq : gaussian ] and [ eq : dap ] as for large sample sizes .",
    "figure  [ fig : posteriors]c shows the evolution of equation  [ eq : jeffreys ] as the sample size is increased while the fraction of events that pass the cut is held constant .",
    "the posterior pdf of equation  [ eq : jeffreys ] is included for completeness and will not be used in this solution to the measurement problem .",
    "notice that the use of a divergent prior excludes cases of @xmath98 .",
    "jeffreys prior would be used in those cases when an experimentalist claims complete ignorance of the efficiency of the cut in the absence of any surviving events ; _ i.e. _ , if _",
    "zero _ events pass the cut , the experimentalist who favors jeffreys prior will not claim that _ any _ event will _ ever _ pass the cut .",
    "this is obviously not satisfactory when attempting to set upper limits on a data sample with zero surviving events .",
    "in such a case , if the experimentalist is comfortable with setting the most likely value of the posterior @xmath86 at @xmath99 when @xmath98 , a flat prior should be used .",
    "the three different posteriors , equations  [ eq : gaussian ] , [ eq : dap ] and [ eq : jeffreys ] , demonstrate a feature of bpt ; as the sample size increases the posterior pdf becomes less sensitive to the particular choice of the prior pdf .",
    "furthermore , as long as the most likely value of the distribution is not too close to its limiting values , as the sample size increases , the gaussian distribution more closely approximates the posterior pdfs of equations  [ eq : dap ] and [ eq : jeffreys ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : three_nt]a shows the three different posteriors in the case of small sample size ; figure  [ fig : three_nt]b shows the same distributions from a twenty times larger sample .    in this paper",
    "the notation @xmath100 represents a pdf of no particular form . for complete generality",
    ", the pdfs for the efficiencies @xmath14 and @xmath23 will be written as @xmath101 and @xmath102 ; it should be assumed that for the remainder of this paper each is a shorthand representation for a binomial posterior described by equation  [ eq : dap ] .",
    "for other cases , the notation @xmath103 will be used to describe a binomial posterior of the form given by equation  [ eq : dap ] , while @xmath104 describes an explicitly gaussian pdf of the form given by equation  [ eq : gaussian ] . even though the posterior pdf represents the complete knowledge of the particular distribution of possible values of a measured quantity , it is common to summarize the results of an experiment , _",
    "i.e. _  the posterior , with only a few numbers .",
    "typically an experimental result will be quoted as the most likely value ( the mode of the posterior ) with an upper and lower limit such that the most likely value is contained within the limits at some confidence level .",
    "for multi - modal posteriors it may be more appealing to quote the mean of the posterior rather than the modal value .",
    "binomial problems do not of themselves give rise to multimodal posteriors .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , the most likely value of a posterior will be quoted ; the most likely value of a posterior @xmath100 will be represented @xmath105 .",
    "when error bars for a confidence level @xmath106 are quoted , they describe the shortest interval about the most likely value that contains area @xmath106 beneath the posterior pdf . figure  [ fig : conf_level ] shows the @xmath107 and @xmath108 confidence intervals for a bayesian posterior constructed by equation  [ eq : dap ] .",
    "in section  [ sec - tutorial ] it was shown that bpt can be used in binomial problems to construct posterior pdfs that exist completely within the allowed physical region .",
    "the application of cuts to finite data sets is a binomial problem : events in a data sample will either pass or fail a particular cut . while this classification is completely natural during the course of an experiment , the binomial quantity of interest is not the fraction of events which pass a cut , but the fraction of signal events in the original sample .",
    "a useful theorem of bpt provides a means of constructing a physical posterior pdf @xmath109 ) from the experimental posterior pdf @xmath86 .    generally ,",

    "the efficiency @xmath14 , the rfficiency @xmath23 , the size of the sample @xmath3 , and the number of events which pass the cut @xmath4 all contribute to the posterior pdf for the fraction of the signal events in the original sample .",

    "alternately , equation  [ eq : mprob_solv ] could be written in terms of @xmath120 , because of the trivial relationship @xmath121 .",
    "this method of constructing @xmath122 from equation  [ eq : mprob_solv ] allows the state - of - knowledge of @xmath14 and @xmath23 to enter the understanding of @xmath47 in a natural way .",

    "often experimentalists face the dilemma of diverting bandwidth from the recording of possible signal sources to the task of increasing the size of control samples , especially when suffering from limited statistics in one or more control samples .",

    "see example 2 below .    it should be noted that even in cases where @xmath14 and @xmath23 are known very precisely , small sample sizes may lead to a pdf @xmath86 which has non - zero values outside the physical region @xmath126 . in such cases ,",

    "<S> several examples are used to illustrate the features of this method , including the discovery of the top quark and searches for new particles produced in association with @xmath0 bosons . </S>",
    "<S> it is also demonstrated how to use this method to make projections for the potential discovery of a standard model higgs boson at a tevatron run 2 experiment , as well as the utility of measuring the integrated luminosity through inclusive @xmath1 production . </S>"
