    "the edwards - anderson ising spin glass ( isg ) has been studied intensively for over twenty five years . in this model ising spins on a regular lattice in dimension three are coupled by random near neighbour interactions @xcite . despite its deceptively simple definition , the basic physics of this canonical complex system still eludes consensus .",
    "recently interest has focused on the correct description of the ground state and the low energy excited states @xcite , but finite temperature aspects are also highly important , in particular the critical behaviour at the freezing temperature @xmath0 . over the years a number of numerical efforts have been consecrated to accurate measurements near @xmath0 , with the aim first of demonstrating that @xmath0 is non - zero , and then of determining the critical exponents precisely @xcite .",
    "the long relaxation times and the need to average over large numbers of independent samples renders the task numerically laborious .",
    "in addition , it has not always been appreciated that corrections to finite size scaling can be singularly vicious in this system .    here",
    "we will concentrate on the problem of the accurate and reliable determination of @xmath0 and the critical exponents for the isg with binomial ( @xmath1 ) near neighbour interactions in a dimension three simple cubic lattice ( @xmath4 ) ,    @xmath5    with @xmath6 chosen at random as @xmath7 . as this system is the dropsophilia of spin glass studies , it is important to establish as precisely and reliably as possible the basic parameters of its critical behaviour .",
    "we will show that a parameter set can be obtained consistent with most published data from different complementary approaches , if corrections to finite size scaling are properly taken into account .",
    "we will principally refer to the simulations of references @xcite ; the estimates drawn from the analyses of the numerical data are shown in table i. we will comment on these data as we go along . the main numerical contribution of the present work is to present non - equilibrium data of higher statistical accuracy than before , and to allow for corrections to finite size scaling in the analysis of these results also .    as a general rule ,",
    "the apparent exponent values are strongly correlated with the value assumed for the ordering temperature , so once @xmath0 is well determined it is relatively easy to obtain good values for the exponents . on the contrary , if the wrong @xmath0 is used , the estimates of the exponents will be biased .",
    "finite size scaling methods have been widely used , but corrections to finite size scaling have often been overlooked , which is dangerous . in table",
    "i the estimates of the ordering temperatures and of the exponents from different publications should not be considered as independent of each other , but each parameter set should be taken as a whole .",
    "the autocorrelation function at time @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 where the average ( @xmath10)is over all spins . in practice a large number of further averages ( denoted by @xmath11$])are taken over many samples all of size @xmath12 spins with microscopically different arrangements of the bonds .",
    "we will use @xmath13 to mean @xmath14 at times long enough for the system to have entered the equilibrium fluctuation regime .",
    "periodic ( toroidal ) boundary conditions are generally but not always used ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the equilibrium spin glass susceptibility is given by @xmath15\\ ] ] where the average is taken over time once the sample has been annealed to equilibrium either by carrying out enough annealing steps or by using the more sophisticated and efficient parallel tempering method @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium susceptibility @xmath16 is the spin glass susceptibility at time @xmath8 @xmath17\\ ] ] after a simple anneal which starts from a totally uncorrelated ( infinite temperature ) state and lasts a time @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the first large scale simulations on this problem were those of ogielski @xcite who did massive dynamic and static measurements on samples as large as @xmath18 .",
    "his values were considered authoritative until finite size scaling techniques were later intensively exploited @xcite .",
    "the standard scaling method to estimate @xmath0 from finite size data in isgs is through the use of the dimensionless binder parameter ,    @xmath19/2\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are moments of the fluctuations of the autocorrelation parameter @xmath14 in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath22 .",
    "the averages are taken first over time and then over samples . in absence of corrections to finite size scaling , the family of curves @xmath23 for different sizes @xmath24 must all intersect precisely at @xmath25 for @xmath26 . for the 3d binomial isg ,",
    "the @xmath27 curves come together near @xmath28 @xcite but very good statistics are needed to see intersections @xcite .",
    "precisely because the @xmath27 curves lie very close together , even small corrections to finite size scaling can have a drastic effect on the crossing point temperatures . as corrections to finite size scaling are already visible for the spin glass susceptibility @xcite , corrections can be expected _ a fortiori _ for the binder parameter .",
    "if @xmath29 is the leading correction to scaling exponent , at @xmath0 the successive @xmath30 values for increasing @xmath24 can be expected to behave as @xmath31\\ ] ]    it has been pointed out @xcite that in these circumstances it is helpful to use the `` quotient method '' .",
    "an elementary version of this method is to use `` crossing points '' .",
    "successive intersection temperatures @xmath32 , corresponding to intersections of curves @xmath27 and @xmath33 , are plotted .",
    "if the leading correction exponent @xmath29 dominates , then @xmath32 values should extrapolate to the true infinite @xmath24 ordering temperature @xmath0 as    @xmath34    extrapolation to infinite @xmath24 provides a precise estimate for @xmath0 , if the corrections to finite size scaling are fully under control . in the case of the 3d binomial isg ,",
    "accurate @xmath27 data for sizes @xmath35 @xcite , for @xmath36 @xcite and for @xmath37 @xcite can be used to obtain intersections .",
    "it should be noted that for technical reasons the boundary conditions used by ballesteros et al @xcite on a specially built dedicated computer are helicoidal while for the other calculations the boundary conditions are periodic",
    ". a direct comparison of the raw data from @xcite and @xcite indicates that systematic differences in the results because of the different boundary conditions are negligible for the spin glass susceptibility at @xmath38 .",
    "the sequence of binder parameter curves for @xmath39 @xcite behaves smoothly , although the @xmath40 curve is the only one in the set to have helicoidal boundary conditions .",
    "a subset of the data from the different sources is shown for illustration in figure 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the behaviour of the @xmath27 curves and hence of the crossing temperatures varies in a non - monotonic manner with @xmath24 .",
    "( we suggest below that this may be because @xmath29 is high and analytic corrections may be non - negligible ) .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath41 values of ballesteros et al @xcite correspond to an effective exponent @xmath42 .",
    "( estimates of @xmath29 vary considerably from author to author and we will return to this point later ) . in figure 2 we have plotted @xmath32 in the form of equation ( 2 ) using the central value of the exponent .",
    "the pairs of sizes @xmath43 $ ] we have used are [ 20,10 ] and [ 10,5 ] where the boundary conditions are helicoidal , [ 16,8],[12,6],[8,4 ] and [ 6,3 ] where the boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "there is no very obvious systematic difference between the two sets of points with different boundary conditions . even for the larger sizes the crossing temperature is still increasing fairly rapidly with increasing @xmath24 ; the very high quality data of @xcite show a @xmath44 crossing already at @xmath45 ,",
    "so the central estimate given by @xcite , @xmath46 , is definitely too low .",
    "the curve in figure 2 ( a two paramereter spline fit ) is just a schematic indication of one possible extrapolation to to infinite @xmath24 which would appear to lead to a significantly higher estimate for @xmath0 than that of @xcite , @xmath47 .",
    "alternative curves could be drawn through the data points , but the binder parameter data ( including the high quality results of @xcite ) point to a higher @xmath0 than their central estimate .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of the crossing points means that not only the leading correction term is operative .",
    "thus in the case of this particular isg system the binder parameter method can only give a rough estimate of @xmath0 , because the correction terms are badly under control .",
    "it should be noted that because the behaviour of the crossing temperature @xmath32 is not monotonic , if only measurements of @xmath27 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 were available one would see an excellent unique intersection of the three @xmath27 curves , but this intersection point is not at the true infinite size limit temperature @xmath0 .",
    "it is an artefact of the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath32 .",
    "binder parameter data can also be directly used to estimate the exponent @xmath41 , as @xmath50 at @xmath0 . using a single @xmath27 data set",
    ", the value of @xmath41 estimated in this way depends strongly on the @xmath0 estimate .",
    "the variation of the @xmath27 slopes with @xmath24 in the @xmath30 data of ballesteros et al provide an apparent @xmath41 value which is about @xmath51 if @xmath52 ( their preferred value ) ; if @xmath0 is higher then the associated estimate for @xmath41 from the same data set is lower . once again",
    "estimates can be affected also by correction terms .",
    "( similarly , the apparent @xmath53 from spin glass susceptibility data changes rapidly with the assumed @xmath0 , figure 7 ) .",
    "ballesteros et al @xcite do not in fact base their @xmath0 estimate on their binder parameter data , but use an independent criterion : the intersection of curves for the ratio of the size dependent correlation length to @xmath24 .",
    "however they show data for three sizes only ( @xmath54 ) and do not discuss possible corrections to finite size scaling for this parameter , even for @xmath24 as low as @xmath40 . even though their intersection point for these three sizes appears to be unique and very clear ,",
    "the @xmath0 estimate from this criterion ( @xmath47 ) is lower than the prefered @xmath0 value obtained from other measurements which we will discuss below , @xmath2 .",
    "although both series of measurements show clear evidence for a well established transition , and though the difference between the estimated transition temperatures is only about @xmath55 , it would be more satisfactory if complete agreement could be reached .",
    "it is of interest to note that quite independent information from series calculations can throw further light on the values of the ordering temperature and the exponents .",
    "long series results on the 3d binomial system @xcite provide sets of parameters @xmath56_a$ ] corresponding to different approximants , figure 3 . the parameter pair @xmath56 $ ] representing the true phase transition can be expected to lie somewhere within the cloud of approximant points . in figure 3",
    "we represent the approximant points from @xcite together with the equivalent points from the different numerical simulation estimates from table i ( using @xmath57 ) .",
    "it can be seen that while the approximant cloud has a relatively wide spread in temperature and so is not very discriminatory for @xmath0 , the cloud has a fairly narrow distribution in @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath58 values corresponding to the parameter sets of references @xcite , @xciteand @xcite in table i lie systematically above the series data , while the @xmath56 $ ] pairs of @xcite and @xcite fall neatly in the centre of the approximant cloud . in dimension 4",
    "the agreement between series @xcite and simulations @xcite is excellent , so there seems no _ a priori _ reason to expect the series results to be strongly biased in dimension 3 .",
    "we have proposed a novel technique including non - equilibrium data for identifying @xmath0 numerically through the combination of three simulations @xcite .",
    "we will use it again in the present context in a slightly modified form .",
    "first , the non - equilibrium spin glass susceptibility for samples quenched to @xmath0 increases with time as @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath53 and @xmath61 being the standard equilibrium static and dynamic exponents @xcite .",
    "secondly the autocorrelation function decay @xmath14 at @xmath0 is of the form @xmath62 , if a sample is initially annealed at @xmath0 during a long waiting time @xmath63 , under the condition that the measuring time for the decay @xmath8 is much shorter than @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath64 at @xmath0 is related to the equilibrium exponents through @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the equilibrium spin glass susceptibility at @xmath0 increases with sample size as @xcite @xmath66    the effective exponent @xmath67 can be measured directly as a function of trial temperatures @xmath22 .",
    "it can also be evaluated indirectly and independently through combining the effective exponent @xmath68 from the finite size scaling of the equilibrium susceptibility , with the effective decay exponent @xmath69 .",
    "we will refer to this derived value as @xmath70 :    @xmath71    measurements of each of the three effective parameters ( @xmath72 ) can be made at a series of trial temperatures @xmath22 ; consistency dictates that at @xmath0 we must have @xmath73 so when @xmath74 , then @xmath26 .",
    "once again , care must be taken to avoid errors arising from corrections to finite size scaling .",
    "for the measurements of @xmath67 , large samples can readily be used , so it is relatively easy to insure that for the time range used the system is far from the saturation limit for that particular size , see @xcite . at short times there can however be finite time corrections , the analogue of finite size corrections , as the clusters of correlated spins that are gradually building up with annealing time @xmath8 have a @xmath8 dependent finite size , even if the sample size @xmath24 can treated as effectively infinite . including the finite time correction , we should write @xcite @xmath75\\ ] ] with @xmath67 as above , and @xmath3 the leading dynamic correction to scaling exponent ( which does not have to be equal to the static exponent @xmath29@xcite ) . the factors @xmath76 and @xmath77 may vary with @xmath22 .",
    "an example of data is shown for two alternative plots in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "( rather than @xmath16 we plot @xmath78 because at infinite @xmath22 , @xmath79 .",
    "measurements were averaged over runs on 6766 samples of size @xmath80 at temperature @xmath81 . for this size saturation to the finite size limited equilibrium susceptibility would only occur at @xmath82 ) .",
    "for this particular temperature the best fit gives for the important exponent @xmath67 a value of @xmath83 .",
    "our results for @xmath67 at different temperatures , figure 7 , are in good agreement with those of @xcite , but have higher statistical accuracy and allow for the correction to scaling which was not considered in the earlier work .",
    "we have checked that our estimates for @xmath67 do not change when we use sample sizes @xmath24 from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ; this means that we should be in the limit such that the @xmath67 values represent the infinite size behaviour .",
    "estimates of @xmath86 from the analyses of the non - equilibrium susceptibility data have statistical fluctuations but do not show any systematic trend with @xmath22 over the fairly narrow range of @xmath22 values near @xmath0 that we have explored , so our estimate of @xmath86 is not sensitive to the exact choice for @xmath0 .",
    "the mean value is @xmath87 . as a number of independent measurements",
    "have shown that the dynamic exponent @xmath61 is near @xmath88 ( @xcite and our estimate given below at the end of the analysis ) , we can deduce from @xmath86 that the dynamic correction to scaling exponent @xmath89 .",
    "this turns out to be very close to the static exponent value @xmath90 estimated from an analysis of the size dependence of the spin glass susceptibility @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "it is distinctly higher than the estimate @xmath92 given by @xcite .",
    "( an attempt to fit the @xmath93 data with a correction exponent @xmath86 of the order of @xmath94 fails completely ) .",
    "there is an independent check on the expected size of @xmath29 .",
    "estimates of @xmath29 can be obtained from series expansion data through @xmath95 @xcite where @xmath96 the appropriate correction to scaling parameter for the series work . in dimension 4 a reliable value @xmath97",
    "was obtained @xcite ; in dimension 3 the estimate by the same authors is @xmath98 with rather lower accuracy . in the sequence of ising ferromagnets @xcite and for the sequence of percolation models @xcite , @xmath29 increases regularly with @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the upper critical dimension ( @xmath101 for ising ferromagnets , @xmath88 for the percolation model as for isgs ) .",
    "the high value of @xmath29 , near @xmath102 in dimension 3 from the isg series work , is consistent with the value from the present simulation analysis and is also consistent with there also being a general upward trend for @xmath29 with increasing @xmath99 in isgs .",
    "a much lower estimate for @xmath29 @xcite seems inconsistent with the series work .",
    "a large correction exponent means that the correction factors tend towards @xmath103 quite rapidly as @xmath24 or @xmath8 increase , so the large size or long time limiting behaviour can be reached fairly readily .",
    "however for large @xmath29 it may not be safe to ignore analytic corrections to scaling @xcite , which could perhaps explain the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath104 from the binder parameter data seen above , figure 2 .    for the estimates of @xmath69 , the measurement runs for @xmath14",
    "must be preceded by long annealing runs .",
    "it turns out that after an appropriate anneal the algebraic form with constant @xmath69 sets in from rather short times ( a few monte carlo steps ) , and the measurements are self averaging @xcite .",
    "deviations from the asymptotic behaviour are so small that no meaningful analysis in terms of corrections to scaling could be carried out ( see for instance the @xmath14 data shown in @xcite ) . as a consequence it is relatively easy to obtain robust and accurate values of @xmath69 on large samples . the data of references @xcite and @xcite are accurate and in excellent agreement with each other , figure 6 .",
    "our own data are in full agreement with these values so we have relied on the published measurements . in isgs the relaxation function continues to be algebraic for temperatures below @xmath0 , so there is no problem in defining @xmath69 , while above @xmath0 an additional relaxation term with a cutoff function form appears .",
    "ogielski introduced phenomenologically the stretched exponential decay in this context to parametrise the cutoff function , and it has been frequently used since . for present purposes , at temperatures where the pure algebraic decay no longer holds , one is clearly above @xmath0 .    again , as for @xmath67 , @xmath69 can be measured on almost arbitrarily large samples .",
    "this is an important advantage of methods where achieving strict thermal equilibrium is not obligatory .",
    "numerically the most demanding of the three measurements is that of the size dependent equilibrium spin glass susceptibility @xmath105 .",
    "we have relied on the excellent data of @xcite , which extend up to sizes @xmath24 from @xmath49 to @xmath106 depending on the temperature .",
    "the method of allowing for corrections to finite size scaling is outlined in @xcite .",
    "essentially , a reliable estimate of the effective temperature dependent exponent @xmath68 can be obtained from a fit to @xmath105 including the correction factor @xmath107 with an effective exponent @xmath68 at and below @xmath0 and a temperature independent @xmath29 .",
    "the correction term turns out to be more important than the statistical error only for @xmath108 .",
    "( we have checked that the raw equilibrium @xmath105 data exhibited by @xcite are in excellent agreement with those of @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath105 results can be taken to provide good infinite size limit estimates for @xmath68 , figure 7 , with individual errors of about @xmath109 including statistical and systematic contributions .",
    "above @xmath0 the @xmath110 curves start to bend down with large @xmath24 , as would be expected from the general scaling form .",
    "the results for @xmath67 and @xmath70 as defined above are shown in figure 8 .",
    "there is a clean intersection at @xmath111 which we can take to be a reliable estimate for @xmath0 , essentially free of corrections to finite size scaling because in each data set care has been taken to use as large samples as possible , and to allow for corrections to finite size scaling whenever appropriate .",
    "the clean intersection should set at rest any lingering suspicion @xcite that there is not a true transition in this spin glass at a critical temperature @xmath0 close to that estimated by ogielski @xcite many years ago .",
    "we obtain the corresponding exponents from an analysis of the various data , with @xmath0 in hand , table i. consistent and precise values are obtained using finite size scaling for @xmath105 @xcite with correction terms @xcite , and from the large sample data shown by ogielski @xcite .",
    "the value estimated for @xmath61 directly from the critical values of @xmath112 and @xmath64 is @xmath113 which can be compared with @xmath114 from @xcite .",
    "the major source of error for all the exponents ( as reflected in the error bars ) is the estimated uncertainty in @xmath0 .",

    "the present estimate for @xmath145 intrapolates smoothly into the sequence of values obtained independently for the other dimensions .",
    "in conclusion , we have once again considered the problem of obtaining reliable estimates for the ordering temperature of the binomial interaction isg in dimension three and for the associated critical exponents .",
    "it is very important to allow for corrections to finite size scaling for this particular system .",
    "it is clear from figures 1 and 2 that binder parameter crossing points in this isg are strongly affected by substantial corrections to finite size scaling even up to and beyond sizes as large as @xmath38 . for the spin glass susceptibility @xmath146 , corrections to scaling",
    "are also present but their influence virtually dies out by @xmath147 . from non - equilibrium susceptibility data we obtain an estimate for the value of the dynamic correction to scaling exponent which is large , @xmath89 , and very similar to a previous estimate of the static correction to scaling exponent @xmath29 @xcite .    from an analysis of non - equilibrium data on large samples together with equilibrium susceptibilites",
    "@xcite , our estimates for @xmath2 , and the associated static critical exponents , are in excellent agreement with those of ogielski @xcite who made dynamic and static measurements on even larger samples ( up to @xmath18 ) .",
    "they are close to those of palassini and caracciolo @xcite , who carefully extrapolated to infinite size , explicitly allowing for corrections to finite size scaling .",
    "they are consistent with high quality series results @xcite , which come from a method complementary to and independent of the monte carlo numerical simulations . when binder parameter data are extrapolated to large @xmath24 ,",
    "the @xmath0 estimate obtained is imprecise because of uncertainties in the corrections to finite size scaling , but within the errors it is consistent with the estimates using the other techniques .",
