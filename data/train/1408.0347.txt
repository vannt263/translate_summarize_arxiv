    "the interest in the collisional dynamics in a planetary system goes back to poincar . in particular , in @xcite he studies the planetary three - body problem , with one body of large mass ( the sun ) and two bodies of small mass ( the planets ) .",
    "he indicates how to find periodic solutions ( of _ deuxime espce _ ) , as perturbations of periodic collisional solutions he can construct when the mass of the planets are infinitely small and the distance between them becomes infinitely small . in this approximation ,",
    "the two bodies are on keplerian ellipses until the `` choc '' ( i.e. the interaction ) , which moves the bodies on two other keplerian ellipses . during the interaction , only the total energy and the total momentum",
    "are conserved , and the choc acts as an elastic collision .",
    "it should be noted that the collision can moves the bodies also on hyperbolic orbits but poincar is only interested in elliptic case .    in this work , we prove that , for this collisional dynamics , there exists an invariant bounded region of of positive measure in the phase space .",
    "more precisely , we consider two bodies moving on elliptic keplerian orbits around a center , interacting only by means of collisions .",
    "a collision changes the orbital parameters of the bodies , and a sequence of collisions can move one of the bodies out of the system , on parabolic or hyperbolic orbits .",
    "we show that for suitable values of the total energy and the total angular momentum ( easily computable ) , the bodies remain on elliptic colliding orbits .",
    "moreover , we extend this result to the case of two point particles interacting by means a bounded short range potential .",
    "we are neglecting the gravitational interaction between the bodies and the influence on the attractive center .",
    "these approximations can be only justified for very light particles and for a few revolution times ( the time between two consecutive collisions can be very long with respect to the revolution period of the particles ) . considering this",
    ", our result has the following interpretation for real systems : the particles can not leave the system due to the collisions , unless other perturbations change enough the orbital parameters .",
    "our result seems not known in the literature , despite its simplicity and despite the great interest in research on planetary systems .",
    "we run in the result while we were studying a numerical models for the dynamics of inelastic particles of planetary rings .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) that the inelasticity of the collisions is sufficient to guarantee the persistence of the rings .",
    "in contrast , in the case of elastic collisions , almost all the particles leave the system on hyperbolic orbits . here",
    "we prove that in the case of only two particles , the inelasticity is not needed to avoid that the orbits become hyperbolic or parabolic ; in this sense , two colliding particles are a stable subsystem of a ring .",
    "this observation and its consequences can be interesting for the study of various models of planetary rings . in particular , in some models it is assumed that the collisions are elastic for small relative velocities ( see @xcite for experimental result on the inelasticity of ice balls ) .    from the mathematical point of view",
    ", it can be interesting to study how the particles moves on the invariant region .",
    "preliminary two - dimensional numerical simulations , in which the impact parameter is randomly chosen , show that the two orbits are approximately tangent , for most of the time .",
    "it is difficult to implement a numerical simulation for the more realistic three - dimensional case .",
    "the problem is that it is not easy to find efficiently the values of the anomalies which correspond to collisional configurations .",
    "some useful suggestion and some technical insight can be obtained analyzing the solutions to the problem of finding the critical points of the distance from two elliptic orbits ( see @xcite ) .",
    ".3 cm the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sez : problema ] , we establish the mathematical notation and the exact nature of the problem . in section [ sezione : invariante ] , we analyze a simplified model considering a two - dimensional _ dynamics of the orbits _ instead of the dynamics of the to bodies .",
    "we consider more general cases in section [ sezione : estensioni ] ( two bodies in @xmath0 ) and in section [ sezione : dim3 ] , in which we analyze the case of two bodies in @xmath1 ; here we also analyze the case of point particles interacting by means a short range potential .",
    "the system we analyze consists in two spherical bodies , of mass @xmath2 and @xmath3 and radii @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , which are attracted by a fixed gravitational center and interact by means of elastic or inelastic collisions .",
    "we indicate with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the position of the center and the velocity of the body @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the total mass and with @xmath10 the fraction of the total mass carried by the body @xmath11 .",
    "we choose the units of measure in such that the gravitational potential energy of the body @xmath11 is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the distance from the attracting center .    in the case of hard spheres ,",
    "inelastic collisions can be modeled supposing that only a part of the normal impulse is transferred , while the tangential one is conserved .",
    "let us denote with @xmath14 the direction of the relative position at the moment of the impact , and with @xmath15 the relative velocity .",
    "the particles are in the incoming configuration iff @xmath16 . the relative velocity",
    "after the collision is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the identity matrix , @xmath19 is the tensor product , @xmath20 is the projector on the direction of @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the projector on the orthogonal plane to @xmath21 , and finally @xmath23 $ ] is the parameter of inelasticity , which is @xmath24 in the case of the elastic collision .",
    "the outgoing velocities @xmath25 , @xmath26 can be obtained from @xmath27 using the conservation of the velocity of the center of mass @xmath28 if the collision is inelastic , the normal component of @xmath29 is reduced in modulus : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the _ coefficient of restitution _ which is @xmath32 in the elastic case .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath33 decreases and becomes @xmath34    we remark that in some model it is assumed that also the tangential component @xmath35 is reduced ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the restitution coefficient can depend on the relative velocity , as shown in a huge number of theoretical and experimental studies ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) . in all these models the kinetic energy decreases .",
    "let us describe what it can be happen to the orbits after a collision of the two bodies . before the collision both energies are negative : @xmath36 these conditions are equivalent to @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath38 the inequalities are satisfied , then , after the collision , the orbits remain elliptic because @xmath39 , as follows from eq.s , .",
    "the hypothesis is not sufficient to avoid that one of the particles leaves the system , because the next collision can take place at other points with very different values of @xmath29 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "more in general , a sequence of collisions on different points can end with a particle which leaves the system on an hyperbolic orbit .    in the next section",
    "we show how to control the condition of ellipticity , regardless the collision history .",
    "let us first note that , for bodies with vanishing radii , the possible points of collision are at most two , which is the maximum number of intersection of two non identical co - focal keplerian orbits . as noted by poincar in @xcite ,",
    "if two orbits have two points of intersections the points and the center of gravity are on a line or the two orbits are in a plane",
    ". then we start our analysis in section [ sezione : invariante ] with the two dimensional case , also simplifying the dynamics considering two point particles .",
    "in this section we consider a simplified bi - dimensional mathematical model .",
    "we suppose that the bodies are point particles moving on co - focal keplerian orbits in a plane . in order to allow",
    "the particles collide , we have to assume that the orbits intersect ( note that this can happen at most in two points ) .",
    "although this condition is satisfied , the particles can not collide because the cross section is zero for dimensionless bodies . in order to avoids this problem , we considered the _ dynamics of the orbits _ : we choose as variables the parameters of two orbits @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and we evolve the system with the following procedure : we choose one of the points of intersection , we consider in that point two fictitious particles on the two orbits , we choose an impact parameter @xmath21 and we consider the resulting orbits @xmath45 and @xmath46 after the collision of the two particles",
    ". we will show , in theorem [ teo : inter ] , that for sufficiently low value of the total energy , the new orbits @xmath45 and @xmath46 remain intersecting ellipses , for any choice between the two possible collision points and for any choice of the impact parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the keys points of the proof are the conservation of the total momentum , the decrease of the energy , and the fact that the condition of intersection of the orbits is a feature preserved by the dynamics .",
    "for the orbit @xmath47 of the particle @xmath11 , @xmath48 is the angle between the @xmath49 axis and the position of the periapsis ( the point of the orbit of the minimal distances from the attractive center ) ; @xmath50 is the true anomaly , i.e. the angle in the orbital plane between the particle and the periapsis of the orbit ; @xmath51 is the specific energy ( i.e. the energy for unit of mass ) ; @xmath52 is the specific angular momentum ; @xmath53 is the eccentricity .",
    "the position of the particle @xmath11 in orbits is given by @xmath54    all the quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 are conserved during the keplerian motion but only the combinations @xmath57 ( the total energy ) and @xmath58 ( the total angular momentum ) are conserved in the elastic collisions , moreover @xmath57 decreases if the collisions are inelastic .",
    "we fix the initial values of the specific energy and the specific angular momentum of the whole system : @xmath59 we can assume @xmath60 without loss of generality , and we consider @xmath61 , which is the case of a couple of elliptic orbits .",
    "we rewrite the orbital parameters in terms of the differences of the energy and angular momentum : @xmath62 from these quantities we can obtain the shapes ( i.e. the eccentricities ) and the dimensions of the orbits .",
    "theirs positions in the framework are specified by the angles @xmath48 , but we are only interested in the relative position of the two orbits , which is given by @xmath63 .",
    "not all the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 correspond to couple of orbits : namely the energy @xmath55 and the angular momentum @xmath56 must satisfy the condition @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 these inequalities define , in the space @xmath68 , the region of admissibility @xmath69 which we show in fig .",

    "* remarks . *    1 .   as we will see in the proof , if the orbits intersect , the value of @xmath75 is bounded from below : @xmath100 .",
    "according to the spatial scale invariance of the problem , the behavior of the system depends only on the product @xmath75 of the two invariant quantities @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    ". the condition must be rewritten in term of @xmath106 .",
    "the invariant region is large , from two point of view : it contains couples of orbits which can be very different , and the orbits live in a huge region on the configuration space .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath107 , the critical value is @xmath108 , and , for this value , if one of the particles has the same orbit of the earth , the other particle can intersect the jupiter orbit , and can arrive at @xmath109 u.a .",

    "if we consider two orbits with @xmath110 and @xmath111 , their eccentricity is @xmath112 and the ratio between the major and the minor semi - axis is approximately @xmath113 .",
    "we have fixed the attractive center , therefore we are not considering here a three body problem , in which we can fix only the center of mass .",
    "the planetary three body system is usually described as a perturbation of the system obtained in the canonical heliocentric variables neglecting the terms of order @xmath114 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this unperturbed system is a system of two particles moving independently on keplerian orbits , with respect the position of the large body .",
    "the standard gravitational parameters are @xmath115 , and can be different for the two particles . our results also hold in this case , with minor modifications . 7 .",
    "we have done some preliminary numerical simulations for this model , with @xmath116 particles .",
    "for @xmath117 , if initially all the particles can collide with the others , in the elastic case one of the particle leaves the system after few collisions ; in the inelastic case one of the particle stops to interact with the others after few collisions , and the orbits of the others two particles converge .",
    "a system of a large amount of colliding particles exhibits a complex behavior : a certain number of particles ( decreasing with the parameter of inelasticity @xmath118 ) leaves the system , the others particles asymptotically separate in non interacting clusters of one particle or two colliding particles .",
    "let us note that for some different inelastic model ( somewhat artificial ) , it can be proved the existence of `` ringlets '' i.e. the existence of a state of @xmath119 particle which does not cease to interact , and whose orbits converge ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we prove the theorem in the case of elastic collisions , for which @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath75 are conserved quantities , and then the condition is invariant for the dynamics . in the case of inelastic collisions",
    ", the thesis follows from the fact that @xmath78 is conserved and @xmath77 and @xmath75 can only decrease , then the condition is invariant for the dynamics also in this case .",
    "the proof follows from the fact that if @xmath75 is sufficiently close to @xmath120 , and the orbits intersect , then the two orbits are elliptic , as we now show .",
    "the two orbits intersect if @xmath121 for some value of the anomalies @xmath122 and @xmath123 . using eq .",

    "this implies that , if we rotate two intersecting orbits , in such a way that the two periapsides become in opposition ( @xmath135 ) , we obtain two orbits which intersect .",
    "the intersection condition is invariant for the dynamics , then all the values @xmath127 during the evolution are in the set @xmath136 therefore the set @xmath137 is invariant for the dynamics .",
