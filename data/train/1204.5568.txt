    "since the pioneering papers on quantum hall ( qh ) interferometers , the fundamental goal was to extend these investigations to the regime of the fractional qh effect  @xcite .",
    "recently , interference experiments were predicted to be a powerful tool to distinguish between different proposed ground states of the @xmath1 qh liquid  @xcite .",
    "by contrast to the enigmatic @xmath1 qh liquid , there is a theoretical consensus on the properties of the primary laughlin @xmath2 qh state .",
    "for this reason , @xmath2 filling is a good model object .",
    "quantum hall interferometers are realized  @xcite by means of one - dimensional transport through the current - carrying edge states ( es ) .",
    "es were originally introduced  @xcite as the intersections of the filled landau levels with fermi level .",
    "the local connection of two es is equivalent to an optical semi - transparent mirror , so the sample geometry defines the interferometer scheme .",
    "there are two principally different schemes : ( i ) an electronic analog of optical mach - zehnder interferometer ; ( ii ) a fabry - perot interference scheme . in both cases",
    "the phase difference between the interfering paths is externally controlled by variation of the magnetic flux @xmath3 through the interferometer loop  @xcite .",
    "naive expectation of @xmath4 periodicity is only valid if the vacuum @xmath2 qh state within the loop is invariant  @xcite . otherwise , only @xmath5 period can be observed .",
    "\\(i ) there is an etched region inside the interference loop for the standard realization of a mach - zehnder scheme  @xcite .",
    "as ensured by the general topological argumentation  @xcite , only @xmath5 periodicity can be expected in this case .",
    "experimentally , there have been no observation of the interference at fractional fillings in this geometry , possibly because of the limitations on the minimal geometrical size of the interferometer .",
    "\\(ii ) by contrast , low - size fabry - perot interferometers clearly demonstrate interference oscillations even in the fractional regime  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the interference pattern was shown  @xcite to be determined by coulomb blockade effects  @xcite at fractional fillings .    here",
    ", we use a mach - zehnder quantum hall interferometer of a novel design to investigate the interference effects at fractional filling factors .",
    "our device brings together the advantages of usual mach - zehnder and fabry - perot quantum hall interferometers .",
    "it realizes the simplest - for - analysis mach - zehnder interference scheme , free from coulomb blockade effects .",
    "by contrast to the standard mach - zehnder realization , our device does not contain an etched region inside the interference loop .",
    "for the first time for mach - zehnder interference scheme , the device demonstrates interference oscillations with @xmath0 periodicity at fractional filling factor 1/3 .",
    "this result indicates that we observe clear evidence for fractionally charged quasiparticles from simple aharonov - bohm interference .     under the gate and bulk @xmath6 in the gate - gap .",

    "standard two - point magnetoresistance is used to determine the regions of @xmath24 which correspond to qh states in the ungated area .",
    "magnetocapacitance allows to find @xmath26 regions of qh states under the gate .",

    "thus , the oscillations definitely originate from the gate finger region and their period @xmath38 scales with the gate finger dimensions  @xcite .     at constant gate voltage ( a ) or vice versa ( b ) for the sample a at fractional filling factors @xmath39 .",

    "[ oscill3513 ] ( a ) .    for the sample b with narrower gate finger ,",
    "oscillations are much less pronounced at fractional fillings possibly because of wider interaction regions @xmath48 m , see fig .",

    "despite the lower visibility and higher periods , these oscillations support the experimental finding @xmath49}\\approx 3\\delta b^{[1]}$ ] and @xmath50}_{g}\\approx 3 \\delta v^{[1]}_{g } $ ] for the interference at fractional filling factors in mach - zehnder geometry .",
    "low - size interferometers  @xcite are subject  @xcite to coulomb blockade effects  @xcite because the size - induced coulomb gap becomes comparable with the corresponding spectrum ( cyclotron , zeeman or fractional ) one .",
    "by contrast , our device was demonstrated  @xcite to operate in the extreme aharonov - bohm ( ab ) regime , free from coulomb blockade effects , at integer fillings , i.e. the interference period corresponds to the change of the flux @xmath51 through the interferometer loop area @xmath25 by one flux quantum @xmath52 .",
    "we can expect the same ab regime also at @xmath46 for the same size interferometer , since both energy scales are roughly kept constant : the fractional gap at 1/3 is of the order of the zeeman one in 3 times lower magnetic field  @xcite .      to understand the origin of the extreme ab regime , the above edge state picture should be reformulated in terms of compressible / incompressible stripes of electron liquid  @xcite at the etched mesa edge . in the simplest situation of @xmath6 or 2/3",
    "bulk qh incompressible state in the gate - gap , the compressible region at the mesa edge is divided into two by a single narrow incompressible stripe with local filling factor @xmath55 or 1/3 , respectively , see fig .  [ sample ] ( b ) .",
    "we deplete the 2deg under the gate to the same filling factor @xmath56 , so these compressible stripes are separated by an entire incompressible state .",
    "the geometry therefore allows intra - edge transport investigations  @xcite : because of macroscopic gate dimensions , charge transfer takes place only in the gate - gap junction across the @xmath57 incompressible stripe .",
    "gate finger expands the stripe s width underneath , locally damping the intra - edge transport , see fig .",
    "[ sample ] ( b ) .",
    "the specifics of the transport in the presented geometry is the origin of the extreme ab regime even for low - size interferometers .",
    "the standard fabry - perot interferometer represents a conducting island surrounded by the incompressible state of lower filling factor . to observe the interference",
    ", an electron should be added to the island , so the interior of the interferometer loop is subjected to charging  @xcite . by contrast , in our mach - zehnder geometry , charge transfer takes place on both sides of the central incompressible island , determined by the qh liquid under the gate finger , see fig .",
    "[ sample ] ( b ) .",
    "thus , charge transfer through the device is not connected with charging of the interior of the interferometer loop .     for the sample a. ( b , c , d ) shallow oscillations at @xmath46 under the gate finger for the sample b at the bulk @xmath58 : sweeping the gate voltage @xmath26 at constant magnetic field ( b , c ) ; sweeping the magnetic field @xmath24 at constant gate voltage ( d ) .",
    "measurement currents are @xmath59  na in ( b , d ) , and @xmath43  na in ( c ) .",
    "the bath temperature is @xmath54  mk in ( a - d ) .",
    "[ oscill3513 ] ]    the present device , therefore , brings together the advantages of usual mach - zehnder and fabry - perot quantum hall interferometers .",
    "it operates at fractional fillings in the simplest - for - analysis extreme ab regime , free from coulomb blockade effects , and the interferometer loop contains nothing but quantum hall liquid ( there is no any etched region inside ) .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , even in this simplest - for - analysis regime , one should be careful about considering changes in the bulk of the quantum hall fluid as the flux is varied : ( i ) @xmath60 if the excitations are created within the loop , or ( ii ) @xmath61 if the vacuum 1/3 qh state within the loop is invariant , i.e. quasiparticles are not formed in the bulk of the quantum hall liquid within the loop .    from the experimental point of view , ( i ) if one changes the magnetic field within the qh state at fixed gate voltage , both possibilities of ref .",
    "@xcite could be imagined , because the interferometer loop is formed locally at the edge of the macroscopic sample in our device .",
    "thus , we should be careful in the interpretation of the experimental results in this regime .",
    "( ii ) if one changes the gate voltage within the qh state at fixed magnetic field , the concentration is obviously constant , because the qh liquid is incompressible at the qh plateaus  @xcite .",
    "this is the regime of invariant vacuum qh state within the loop .",
    "let us start from the regime of the magnetic field sweep at fixed gate voltage .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that the extreme aharonov - bohm regime means the simplest relation @xmath51 , so @xmath62 .",
    "it seems to be quite natural to ascribe the difference between @xmath49}$ ] and @xmath63}$ ] to the change in the effective loop area @xmath25 .",
    "however , the relation @xmath49}\\approx 3\\delta b^{[1]}$ ] corresponds to the @xmath25 change in 3 times , which ( i ) seems to be too high ; ( ii ) is very close to the filling factors ratio ; ( iii ) is well reproducible for two different samples ( a and b ) , so it hardly can occur incidentally .",
    "moreover , in the integer qh regime @xmath25 was demonstrated to be independent of the magnetic field and integer filling factors  @xcite .    from these arguments , we have to assume that the effective loop area @xmath25 is roughly constant .",
    "thus , the experimental relation @xmath49}\\approx 3\\delta b^{[1]}$ ] indicates @xmath64 flux periodicity for our mach - zehnder interferometer at the fractional filling factor 1/3 .    in the regime of fixed magnetic field , we can only expect @xmath65 flux periodicity .",
    "the analysis of the experiment is however not so straightforward , because one should connect the experimentally observed @xmath66 with the corresponding @xmath67 .",
    "variation @xmath68 slightly changes the effective interferometer area @xmath25 because of electrostatic varying the effective gate finger perimeter . in the simplest capacitor model @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the capacitance between the gate and the compressible region around the gate finger , @xmath71 is the variation of the compressible stripe charge , proportional to @xmath72 and the landau level degeneracy @xmath73 .",
    "we easily obtain @xmath74 ( cp .",
    "ref  @xcite where a similar relation is obtained for the opposite coulomb - dominated regime ; the difference is because the ab regime is not connected with the charging of the loop area ) .",
    "thus , the flux change in the extreme aharonov - bohm regime @xmath75 is directly proportional to the gate voltage period @xmath76 .",
    "this relation is well fulfilled in the integer regime  @xcite .",
    "the roughly constant effective loop area @xmath25 means the roughly constant geometric capacitance @xmath70 .",
    "the experimental relation @xmath50}_{g}\\approx 3 \\delta v^{[1]}_{g } $ ] therefore indicates @xmath64 flux periodicity for our mach - zehnder interferometer in this regime also .    as a result",
    ", our mach - zehnder interferometer for the first time demonstrates interference oscillations at the fractional filling factor 1/3 .",
