    "the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method of estimating early - type galaxy distances has been around for over a decade ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) .",
    "blakeslee , ajhar , & tonry ( 1999 ) have recently reviewed the sbf method , its applications , and calibration .",
    "tonry , ajhar , & luppino ( 1990 ) made the first application in the virgo cluster and calibrated it using theoretical isochrones for the color dependence combined with the cepheid distance to m31 for the zero  point .",
    "tonry ( 1991 ) applied the method to fornax galaxies and made the first fully empirical calibration , differing substantially from the earlier theoretical one .",
    "the situation is now much improved , with the best theoretical models ( worthey 1994 ) agreeing well with the latest empirical calibration .",
    "the @xmath9-band sbf survey of galaxy distances began in earnest in the early 1990 s using the 2.4 m telescope at mdm observatory on kitt peak in the northern hemisphere and the 2.5 m at las campanas observatory in the south .",
    "the survey includes distances to over 330 galaxies reaching out to @xmath10 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "tonry et  al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter sbf - i ) describe the sbf survey sample in detail .",
    "the breakdown by morphology is 55% ellipticals , 40% lenticulars , and 5% spirals .",
    "the median distance error is about 0.2  mag , several times larger than our estimate of the intrinsic scatter in the method .",
    "this is due to the compromises involved in conducting a large survey with an observationally demanding method on small telescopes ; thus , most individual galaxy distances could be improved with reobservation in more favorable conditions .",
    "tonry et  al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter sbf - ii ) investigate the large - scale flow field within and around the local supercluster using extensive parametric modeling .",
    "this modeling is summarized by tonry et  al .  and dressler et  al .",
    "in the present volume .",
    "also in this volume are sbf - related works by pahre et  al .  calibrating the @xmath11-band fundamental plane with sbf survey distances and by liu et  al",
    ".  reporting @xmath11-band sbf measurements in the fornax and coma clusters . here",
    "we present a preliminary comparison of the sbf survey peculiar velocities with expectations from the density field as probed by redshift surveys .",
    "more details on many aspects of this work are given by blakeslee et  al .",
    "we use the method of nusser & davis ( 1994 ; see the description by davis in this volume ) to perform a spherical harmonic solution of the gravity field from the observed galaxy distribution of both the  1.2  jy flux - limited redshift survey ( strauss et  al .  1992 ; fisher et  al .",
    "1995 ) and the optical redshift survey ( ors ) ( santiago et  al .",
    "we assume linear biasing so that the fluctuations in the galaxy number density field are proportional to the mass density fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is the bias factor , and use linear gravitational instability theory ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) so that the predicted peculiar velocities are determined by @xmath13 .",
    "we then compute the distance - redshift relation in the direction of each sample galaxy as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "the comparisons are done with the same subset of sbf survey galaxies as used in sbf - ii : galaxies with good quality data , @xmath15 so that the color calibration applies , and not extreme in their peculiar velocities ( e.g. , no cen-45 ) ; we also omit local group members .",
    "the sample is then 280 galaxies .",
    "we compare the predicted @xmath16@xmath17  relations to the observations using a simple @xmath18 minimization approach , as adopted by riess et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the comparison to the type  ia supernova ( snia ) distances .",
    "figure  [ fig : czd ] gives an illustration . unlike snia distances however , the sbf distances have no secure external tie to the far - field hubble flow , so we allow the overall scale of the distances ( in km / s ) to be a free parameter . the best - fit scale then yields a value for @xmath2 when combined with the sbf tie to the cepheids , which is uncertain at the @xmath19  mag level ( sbf - ii ) .",
    "thus , the 15 or more free parameters of sbf - ii are here replaced by just two parameters : @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "our sample consists mainly of early - type galaxies in groups , with the dominant groups being the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "we use a constant small - scale velocity error @xmath20 km  s@xmath8and deal with group / cluster virial dispersions by using group - averaged redshifts for the galaxies .",
    "the group definitions are from sbf - i ; more than a third of the galaxies are not grouped .",
    "this approach is unlike that of sbf - ii , which used only individual galaxy velocities but a variable _ v@xmath21 .",
    "blakeslee et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) explore several approaches in doing the comparison to the gravity field , including one with no grouping but a variable _ v@xmath21 , and find similar results to what we report below .",
    "in addition , they find negligibly different results when @xmath22 km  s@xmath8  is used instead of 200 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : conts ] displays the joint probability contours on @xmath2 and @xmath14 derived from the @xmath18 analysis of the /sbf and ors / sbf comparisons . the calculations are done in @xmath14  steps of 0.1 and @xmath2 steps of 1 km  s@xmath4mpc .",
    "both redshift surveys call for @xmath23 km  s@xmath4mpc . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the  comparison gives @xmath240.5 , while the ors prefers @xmath25 .",
    "adopting the best @xmath14 models for each comparison , figure  [ fig : chiho ] shows the reduced @xmath18 for 279 degrees of freedom plotted against @xmath2 ( we averaged the @xmath24 and @xmath26 predictions for ) . as there can only be one @xmath2 , and the  and ors surveys are not wholly independent , it is perhaps not surprising that they give consistent results .",
    "interestingly , the preferred @xmath2 splits the difference between the `` sbf @xmath2 '' values proffered by sbf - ii and ferrarese et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    the reduced @xmath18 as a function of @xmath14 for a fixed @xmath2 is shown in figure  [ fig : chibeta ] .",
    "we find @xmath27 for  and @xmath28 for the ors with the adopted @xmath2 .",
    "we see that @xmath20 km  s@xmath8  gives @xmath29 for the ors comparison , and 0.9 for the  comparison ; the latter would have @xmath29 for @xmath30 km  s@xmath8 , very similar to the value of @xmath31 found in the sbf - ii parametric modeling .",
    "the derived @xmath14 s are not sensitive to the adopted @xmath31 , but they are to @xmath2 because of the covariance seen in figure  [ fig : conts ]",
    ". had we adopted an @xmath2 5% larger , the best - fit @xmath14 s would increase by @xmath3230% with still reasonable values of @xmath18 .",
    "we also note that the @xmath14 s are insensitive to our treatment of the clusters .",
    "we experimented by throwing out all galaxies conceivably near the triple - valued zones of virgo , fornax , and ursa major , 40% of the sample . remarkably , the results differ only negligibly , but @xmath33 increases by about 0.15 , and the values of _",
    "v@xmath21  giving @xmath33 of unity increase by 10% .",
    "the  residual plot for the full comparison shown in figure  [ fig : resids ] demonstrates why .",
    "the virgo and fornax clusters near @xmath16 of 1000 and 1400 km  s@xmath8 , respectively , lie close to the zero - difference line with fairly small scatter because they have had their virial dispersions effectively removed , unlike most of the rest of the galaxies . however , for the reason illustrated in figure  [ fig : czd ]",
    ", the clusters do not drive the fit .",
    "figure  [ fig : aitoffs ] shows how the peculiar velocity predictions and observations look on the sky .",
    "the predictions should resemble a noiseless , smoothed version of the observations .",
    "clearly there is general agreement on the most prominent feature , the dipole motion seen in the local group frame .",
    "the observed large negative velocities near @xmath34 indicate rapidly infalling virgo background galaxies , which as noted in figure  [ fig : czd ] , the fit can not reproduce .",
    "this and other issues must be dealt with in future analyses .",
    "we have presented preliminary results from an initial comparison of the sbf survey peculiar velocities with predictions based on the density field of the  and ors redshift surveys .",
    "the comparison simultaneously yields @xmath14 for the density field and a tie to the hubble flow for sbf , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath23 is between the two other recent estimates with sbf . for the  comparison we find @xmath35 , consistent with other recent results populating the 0.40.6 range from `` velocity - velocity '' comparisons using tully - fisher or snia distances ( e.g. , schlegel 1995 ; davis et  al .  1996 ; willick et  al .",
    "1997 ; riess et  al .  1997",
    "; dacosta et  al .  1998 ; willick & strauss 1998 ) .",
    "our value of @xmath36 is the same as that of riess et  al . , and consistent with the expectation @xmath37 from baker et  al .",
    "the numbers change only slightly with different treatments of the galaxy clusters and higher resolution computations ( blakeslee et  al .",
    "our results thus reinforce the `` factor - of - two discrepancy '' with the high @xmath14 s obtained in `` density - density '' comparisons ( e.g. , sigad et  al .",
    "one explanation is a scale - dependent biasing ( e.g. , dekel , this volume ) .",
    "we plan in the near future to pursue comparisons using methods that can deal with multivalued redshift zones directly , such velmod ( willick et  al .  1997 ) and take advantage of sbf s potential for probing small , nonlinear scales .",
    "additionally , we continue to work towards an independent far - field tie to the hubble flow by measuring sbf distances to snia galaxies , through calibration of the @xmath11-band fundamental plane hubble diagram ( pahre et  al . ,",
    "this volume ) , and by pushing out to @xmath38 km  s@xmath8  directly using sbf measurements from space .",
    "this will remove the substantial systematic uncertainty in @xmath14 due to the covariance with @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we also plan to use sbf data for a `` density - density '' measurement of @xmath14 and to explore the nature of the biasing .",
