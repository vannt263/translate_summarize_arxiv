    "a measurement of the total cross section for electron - positron annihilation into hadrons is one of the cleanest methods for the determination of the strong coupling constant @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "its determination , based on the hadronic decay rate of the @xmath4 boson as measured at the large electron - positron collider lep  @xcite , has lead to one of the most precise and theoretically best founded values of this fundamental quantity .",
    "considering the large luminosity of electron - positron colliders at lower energies , similar experimental studies between charm and bottom threshold may lead to an independent measurement of @xmath3 in a completely different energy region , once systematic uncertainties are sufficiently well under control .",
    "although qualitatively similar to the analysis at lep , the extraction of @xmath3 in this lower energy region differs in many details : i ) radiative corrections lead to relatively large contributions from final states with a hard collinear photon and a hadronic system of correspondingly lower invariant mass .",
    "ii ) the narrow charmonium and upsilon resonances contribute through the radiative return and through interferences with the continuum .",
    "iii ) since the measurement is performed not very far above threshold for charm production ( @xmath5 ) , quark mass effects  @xcite can not be neglected .",
    "all these points were discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , specifically for the energy region close to the upsilon resonances and accessible to the cleo experiment at the cesr storage ring . combining @xmath6-measurements between 2  gev and 10.52  gev a value of @xmath7 had been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently the cross section for @xmath8 has been measured between 6.964 and 10.538  gev by the cleo collaboration  @xcite and expressed in terms of the familiar @xmath6 ratio , defined by @xmath9 . with a correlated systematic uncertainty of less than 2%",
    "this is the most precise measurement in this region .",
    "the results for @xmath10 were used by the cleo collaboration to extract in a first step @xmath11 for the seven different energies . at this point the approximation of massless quarks was employed .",
    "subsequently , after combining these results and using the renormalization group equation for the running of @xmath11 from the low energy up to @xmath12 , an average value @xmath13 was obtained , where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic , respectively .    in this brief note",
    "we will demonstrate that proper inclusion of the aforementioned quark mass effects and performing the renormalization group evolution with the correct matching between the theories with four and five light quark flavours , respectively , leads to a significant shift of the final result for @xmath3 which is equal to the quoted statistical plus systematic uncertainties .",
    "as stated in the introduction , quark mass effects can play a significant role in the analyis of the cross section for @xmath8 , since the centre - of - mass energy is quite comparable to the threshold energy for charm production . from the theory side the complete dependence on the charm quark mass",
    "is known up to order @xmath15",
    "higher order contributions can be included by taking the massless expansion up to @xmath16  @xcite plus the power suppressed terms proportional @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite which are known up to third and ( for the quadratic term ) even in fourth order  @xcite . for the analysis discussed below , the @xmath15 approximation is sufficiently precise .",
    "however , for completeness all presently known terms up to order @xmath16 are included .",
    "furthermore , mass suppressed terms  @xcite of order @xmath19 from virtual bottom quarks in @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 production can not be neglected completely and are included in this analysis .",
    "the present analysis is based on the program rhad  @xcite , where all these contributions are included .",
    ".[tab::as ] results for @xmath24 for the seven different energy values where cleo performed the measurement of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "statistical and systematic ( common and uncorrelated ) uncertainties are displayed separately .",

    "in fact , both the inclusion of mass terms in the @xmath6 ratio and the effect of properly matching , if interpreted as @xmath27 , would translate into @xmath28 and correspond to @xmath29 .",
