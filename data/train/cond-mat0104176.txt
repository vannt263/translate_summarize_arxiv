    "the unusual properties of quasiparticle excitations in the cuprate high temperature superconductors , and their possible connection with zero - temperature phase transitions in these systems , have been the subject of intense debate over the past few years .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments fail to find well - defined quasiparticles above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 , and also below @xmath2 a simple bcs - like description does not seem to apply . in this context",
    "one has to distinguish the quasiparticles excitations in ( 1,1 ) direction in momentum space ( gapless nodal quasiparticles of the @xmath0-wave superconductor ) from the ones in ( 1,0 ) or ( 0,1 ) direction ( gapped antinodal quasiparticles ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig_momentum]a .",
    "arpes results  @xcite indicate that the nodal quasiparticles have very short lifetimes in the superconducting state , with their spectral functions having linewidths of order @xmath3 , and there is little change  @xcite in this behavior when tuning @xmath4 through @xmath2 .",
    "the antinodal quasiparticles are broad and ill - defined above @xmath2 @xcite , but appear to narrow significantly below @xmath2  @xcite , forming long - lived states with an energy gap of 30 - 40 mev .    to explain these unusual properties , two main paradigms",
    "have been suggested : either ( i ) the systems reflect the properties of a fundamentally new state of matter , possibly only contiguous to the superconducting state  @xcite or ( ii ) the physics of the stable ground states can be understood in the framework of bcs - like pairing , and many of the unusual finite @xmath4 experimental properties arise from nearby quantum critical points which mask the behavior of the stable phases of the system  @xcite . here",
    ", we shall follow the second line of thought , _",
    "i.e. _ , we assume that the stable phases have no `` exotic '' properties or excitations , and can ( in principle ) be described by an appropriate electron hartree - fock / rpa / bcs theory with perturbative corrections .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss quantum phase transitions in the high-@xmath2 compounds , and their possible connection to the anomalous quasiparticle properties as seen in arpes experiments  @xcite . for reasons explained below , we will concentrate on transitions related to the onset ( a ) of additional @xmath5 or @xmath6 pairing in @xmath7-wave superconductors ( leading to damping of _ nodal _ quasiparticles ) and ( b ) of antiferromagnetic order ( leading to damping of _ antinodal _ quasiparticles ) .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss in more detail some properties of a @xmath1 superconductor close to the quantum critical point ( a ) , and derive its collective excitation spectrum .",
    "= 4.4 in    [ fig_pd ]    the first quantum phase transition studied in the context of cuprate superconductors was the destruction of nel order by doping .",
    "this transition has been proposed  @xcite to belong to the same universality class as the order - disorder transition in insulating antiferromagnets driven by quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this implies a dynamic critical exponent @xmath8 , and a stable @xmath9 `` resonant '' spin excitation near the antiferromagnetic wavevector in the paramagnetic state @xcite , both being consistent with numerous neutron scattering and nmr studies . assuming that the mobile charge carriers have a @xmath0-wave superconducting ground state on both sides of the transition , the arguments for the common universality of the magnetic quantum critical point in insulating and doped antiferromagnets can be sharpened .",
    "the order parameter is a 3-component real field , @xmath10 , which measures the amplitude of the local antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the onset of long - range antiferromagnetism is described by the condensation of @xmath10 , and the theory for the quantum critical point will depend upon whether the @xmath10 couple efficiently to the low - energy fermionic excitations of the @xmath0-wave superconductor ( the @xmath11 bogoliubov quasiparticles ) .",
    "momentum conservation now plays a key role : the dominant fluctuations of @xmath10 occur at the ordering wavevector @xmath12 , and the fermions will be scattered by this the wavevector .",
    "if @xmath12 does not equal the separation between two nodal points of the @xmath0-wave superconductor [ located at momenta @xmath13 with @xmath14 at optimal doping , see fig  [ fig_momentum]a ] , then the fermion scattering does not lead to any disruptive low energy damping of the @xmath10 .",
    "in such a situation , there is no fundamental difference between the low - energy magnetic fluctuations in a superconductor and an insulating paramagnet , and the same theory for the antiferromagnetic quantum transition applies .",
    "of course , these arguments also hold if the charge sector is fully gapped on both sides of the transition , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the ground state around the magnetic quantum critical point is insulating .",
    "the magnetic quantum phase transition alone is not likely to explain the plethora of unusual finite-@xmath4 properties of the cuprates .",
    "instead , it appears that a variety of ordered phases compete in these two - dimensional doped mott insulators , and numerous additional transitions are possible and have been discussed in recent years : the onset of site / bond charge and/or spin density wave order ( `` stripes '' ) @xcite , additional superconducting order like @xmath15 or @xmath16 pairing @xcite , excitonic ( or nematic ) order @xcite , staggered flux ( or @xmath0-density wave ) order @xcite , and `` exotic '' transitions based on the concept of spin - charge separation @xcite . except for the latter ,",
    "all these transitions can be characterized by an order parameter which is assumed to carry a net momentum @xmath12 corresponding to the ordering wavevector .",
    "whereas superconducting and excitonic order have @xmath17 , stripe order is characterized by a finite ( possibly incommensurate ) wavevector @xmath12 , and staggered flux order corresponds to @xmath18 ( similar to antiferromagnetic neel order ) .",
    "we now turn to the influence of these possible quantum phase transitions on the properties of the fermionic quasiparticles , and we will first concentrate on the nodal , _",
    "i.e. _ , the low - energy , fermions . in the vicinity of a quantum transition the fermions will be strongly scattered by bosonic order parameter fluctuations .",
    "similar to the discussion above , two general cases have to be distinguished : either ( a ) the low - energy fermions are scattered into fermion states with higher energy , or ( b ) scattering occurs between low - energy fermions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the wavevector @xmath12 must equal the momentum space separation between two nodal points ( nesting condition ) . in case ( a )",
    "fermion scattering events can be treated as virtual processes , and the critical theory of the quantum phase transition is not fundamentally modified by the presence of the fermions . a perturbative expansion for the fermionic self - energy",
    "is well behaved , and the fermion damping will vanish with a super - linear power of temperature ( @xmath4 ) as @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in case ( b ) the fermions become part of the critical theory , a perturbative expansion in the coupling is infrared singular , and a correct treatment requires a coupled critical theory of bosons and fermions .",
    "the most efficient quasiparticle scattering is provided by a linear , non - derivative coupling between fermion bilinears and order parameter bosons  @xcite .",
    "if such a coupling is relevant in the renormalization group sense , then one expects quantum - critical damping of the fermions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the damping rate will vanish linearly with @xmath4 .    in sec  [ sec",
    ": nodal ] we review theories for the quantum - critical damping of nodal fermions , belonging to case ( b )",
    ". we shall find that a transition to a state with @xmath1 pairing is the most likely candidate in this category .",
    "the damping of antinodal fermions is subject of sec  [ sec : antinodal ] ; we will restrict the discussion to effects arising from the proximity to a magnetic phase transition .",
    "finally , in sec  [ sec : clap ] we return to a @xmath1 superconductor and discuss collective modes arising from fluctuations of the additional order parameter component close to the critical point .",
    "motivated by the arpes experiments on @xmath20 @xcite which indicate a nodal fermion scattering rate being proportional to @xmath4 , we are interested quantum - critical damping of the nodal fermions [ case ( b ) above ] .",
    "it arises from fluctuations near a quantum critical point between the @xmath7 superconductor and some other superconducting state @xmath21 ( see fig  [ fig_pd]b ) .",
    "the corresponding critical theories allow for a well - controlled treatment using renormalization group ( rg ) techniques .",
    "the reason is the restricted phase space for low - energy excitations in a @xmath0-wave superconductor ; in a metallic system [ where case ( b ) is the generic situation ] the situation is much more complicated due to the presence of low - energy particle - hole excitations at arbitrary momenta . as discussed above , quantum - critical scattering requires that the momentum @xmath12 carried by the order parameter connects two nodal points .",
    "three natural possibilities can satisfy this nesting condition : @xmath12 = 0 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "importantly , @xmath24 depends on microscopic parameters , therefore the latter two require fine - tuning , unless there is a mode - locking between the values of @xmath12 and @xmath24 .",
    "candidates for @xmath25 are neel order and staggered - flux order  @xcite , both have @xmath26 , and nesting is apparently not satisfied near optimal doping .",
    "in addition , staggered - flux order leads to a derivative coupling between nodal fermions and the order parameter which can be shown to be irrelevant @xcite .",
    "transitions involving the onset of spin  @xcite or site / bond charge density waves @xcite ( stripes ) can possibly satisfy @xmath23 , however , this restriction on @xmath12 is not realized by the @xmath12 values observed so far .",
    "we are left with @xmath17 being the only possibility which can naturally satisfy the momentum conservation constraints for a range of parameter values .",
    "assuming that the order parameter is a @xmath17 spin - singlet fermion bilinear ( spin triplet condensation at @xmath27 would imply ferromagnetic correlations which are unlikely to be present ) , group theoretic arguments @xcite permit a complete classification of such order parameters .",
    "the order parameter for @xmath21 must be built out of the following correlators ( @xmath28 annihilates an electron with momentum @xmath29 and spin @xmath30 ) @xmath31 e^{i \\varphi } , \\label{orders}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the background @xmath7 pairing which is assumed to be non - zero on both sides of the transition , @xmath33 is the overall phase of the superconducting order , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 contain the possible order parameters for the state @xmath21 corresponding to condensation in the particle - hole ( or excitonic ) channel or additional particle - particle pairing , respectively . the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 can now be expanded in terms of the basis functions of the irreducible representation of the tetragonal point group @xmath36 , and this leads to seven distinct order parameters for the state @xmath21",
    "the corresponding field theories have been analyzed recently  @xcite by means of rg techniques , and the results are simple and remarkable . only for two cases , namely the transitions between a @xmath7-wave superconductor and a state with either @xmath37 or @xmath38 pairing ,",
    "there exists a fixed point describing a second - order quantum phase transition where the fermions are part of the critical theory . for all other cases , we either found runaway flows of the couplings , with no non - trivial fixed points , or a fixed point where the fermions are decoupled from the critical degrees of freedom .    we now describe some aspects of the critical theory for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 cases . in the quantum critical region ( fig  [ fig_pd]b ) the single fermion green s functions being measured in photoemission experiments will obey the scaling form @xmath39 where we have set @xmath40 , @xmath41 and all velocities to unity",
    ". the scale factor @xmath42 is non - universal , while the anomalous exponent @xmath43 and the complex - valued function @xmath44 are universal . the nodal fermions and the order parameter fluctuations",
    "are strongly coupled , and the anomalous dimension of the fermion field , @xmath45 , leads to a large @xmath46 tail in its energy distribution curve ( edc )  @xcite , which is actually consistent with arpes measurement . the scaling function",
    "@xmath44 has been studied in ref @xcite ; for @xmath47 , ( [ scal ] ) reduces to @xcite @xmath48^{1-\\eta_f/2 } } , \\label{tail}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a universal number .",
    "note that the imaginary part of this is non - zero only for @xmath50 , and it decays as @xmath51 for large @xmath46 .",
    "a result for the scaling function in this regime is shown in fig  [ fig_scalf]a . in the opposite limit",
    ", @xmath52 , ( [ scal ] ) has a very different form , and the @xmath53 and @xmath46 dependencies are smooth .",
    "for further discussion we refer the reader to ref  @xcite .",
    "notably , the theories for both cases , @xmath37 and @xmath38 pairing , lead to identical damping behavior for the nodal fermions .",
    "however , they can be distinguished from their effect on the antinodal quasiparticles : @xmath54 fluctuations will couple to all fermions , whereas the @xmath55 order parameter has nodes in the ( 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) directions , therefore leaving the antinodal fermions essentially unaffected .",
    "with reference to the arpes result about sharp antinodal quasiparticles for @xmath56 , we can uniquely propose the @xmath38 transition as explanation for the nodal fermion damping below @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we turn to the anomalous behavior of the antinodal fermions .",
    "arpes experiments show a broad edc above @xmath2 , whereas below @xmath2 a quasiparticle - like peak appears separated from an incoherent tail , and the spectrum has been described as `` peak - dip - hump '' structure  @xcite .    for @xmath56",
    "the antinodal quasiparticles live at a finite energy ( given by the maximum value of the superconducting gap ) , and possible causes for damping are less restricted than in the case of the nodal fermions .",
    "we will concentrate here on fermion scattering by antiferromagnetic fluctuations  @xcite ; other proposals include one - dimensional  @xcite or two - dimensional  @xcite electron fractionalization ( induced by proximity to spin liquid states ) and the coupling to superconducting phase and vortex fluctuations  @xcite , these will not be discussed here .",
    "it can be seen from fig  [ fig_momentum]a that magnetic fluctuations with wavevector @xmath18 can provide an efficient coupling between antinodal quasiparticles .",
    "we will examine their spectral function ( or edc ) in the vicinity of a quantum critical point between a @xmath0-wave superconductor and a state with co - existing superconducting and antiferromagnetic order .",
    "appealing to the proximity of a magnetic quantum critical point allows us to make controlled statements in a regime with strong coupling between the fermionic quasiparticles and the antiferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "as argued in the introduction , the critical theory of the antiferromagnetic transition itself is not influenced by the presence of fermions , because the order parameter fluctuations , @xmath57 , with momentum @xmath18 do not scatter between low - energy nodal fermions of the superconductor .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the theories of sec  [ sec : nodal ] , we can work here with the `` bare '' bosonic theory for the ordering transition , which will now be coupled to a _",
    "antinodal fermion ( `` hole '' ) @xcite .",
    "further simplifications arise from the assumption that the fermion momentum corresponds to an extremum or van - hove point of the band structure .",
    "then , the dispersion has no linear momentum dependence , and rg analysis shows that quadratic and higher terms in the dispersion are irrelevant , therefor the hole may be viewed as dispersionless ( immobile ) . also , the coupling between the charge density of the fermion and the bulk theory is irrelevant under rg .",
    "the resulting theory has the structure of a bose - kondo - like model @xcite of a single quantum spin coupled locally to the bosonic fluctuations of a nearly critical antiferromagnet .",
    "( a similar boundary field theory has been studied  @xcite in the context of zn / li impurities in cuprate superconductors . )",
    "we now turn to the hole spectrum as measured in photoemission . at the @xmath58 quantum critical point at @xmath59 ,",
    "the @xmath57 are gapless critical excitations , and a naive perturbation expansion of the hole self - energy is infrared singular .",
    "our recent rg analysis @xcite of the scale - invariant quantum - field theory permits a resummation of the perturbative expansion . in the @xmath60 , @xmath61 vicinity of the critical point ,",
    "the hole green s function obeys the scaling form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the spin gap of the host antiferromagnet , @xmath64 is a non - universal amplitude and @xmath65 denotes the bare fermion energy at the antinodal point .",
    "the anomalous exponent @xmath66 and the scaling function @xmath67 are again universal .",
    "in particular , at the critical point ( @xmath59 , @xmath58 ) there is no quasiparticle pole , but a power - law singularity described by @xmath68 ( spin orthogonality catastrope ) . numerical results for @xmath67 obtained with a large @xmath69 method  @xcite are displayed in fig  [ fig_scalf]b .",
    "the @xmath70 dependence of @xmath71 arises only from the irrelevant band curvature terms , and their main effect is to replace @xmath65 by the actual hole dispersion near the van - hove point .",
    "we expect that the @xmath59 spectrum in fig  [ fig_scalf]b applies to photoemission at the antinodal points above @xmath2 .",
    "below @xmath2 , the measured antinodal spectrum @xcite is similar to the @xmath72 spectrum in fig  [ fig_scalf]b : this is accounted for in our approach by the reasonable assumption that the onset of superconductivity induces the spin - gap - like correlations and so increases the value of the effective @xmath73 controlling the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the high frequency tail of the edc both above and below @xmath2 should decay as @xmath74 .",
    "in this section , we focus on the @xmath1 superconductor which emerged from our discussion of nodal quasiparticle damping in sec  [ sec : nodal ] .",
    "the aim is to identify the low - energy collective modes which should exist near the quantum phase transition to a state with pure @xmath7 pairing , and to discuss experimental signatures of these modes .",
    "such collective modes have also been considered recently by balatsky _",
    "@xcite , but our results below differ significantly from theirs .",
    "to proceed , we have to derive an effective action for the fluctuations of the @xmath75 order parameter .",
    "we will demonstrate this explicitely on the basis of a sp(@xmath69 ) mean - field theory  @xcite for a @xmath76-@xmath77 model with additional diagonal exchange interaction , @xmath78 , although the results discussed below are far more general .",
    "we start in a regime where the ground state is a pure @xmath7-wave superconductor .",
    "it is described by a saddle point of the large-@xmath69 theory , and superconductivity is encoded in non - zero pairing amplitudes on the links of the square lattice .",
    "now we consider a perturbation which introduces pairing along the diagonals , with an amplitude @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a space and time dependent complex number .",
    "we factor out the overall phase of the superconducting order , @xmath33 , as in ( [ orders ] ) , and so the phase of @xmath80 measures the _ relative _ phase between the @xmath75 and @xmath7 orders .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath33 couple to overall charge fluctuations and these occur at a high plasma frequency  we can therefore neglect @xmath33 in our considerations .",
    "these arguments encapsulate the physics discussed by balatsky _",
    "et al . _ in terms of numbers of cooper pairs with @xmath75 and @xmath7 pairing .",
    "after integrating out the fermions in the @xmath0-wave saddle point , the large-@xmath69 theory gives an effective action for @xmath80 of the following form : @xmath81 \\right\\ } , \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath77 are complex functions , and have expressions given by simple one - loop fermion diagrams .",
    "explicitely , we find @xmath83 here @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the normal and anomalous green s functions of the @xmath0-wave superconductor , and @xmath86 .",
    "= 4.6 in    we now study the small momentum and frequency behavior of the @xmath87 fluctuations .",
    "we perform a small @xmath53 and @xmath88 expansion of ( [ e1 ] ) , with the decomposition @xmath89 , and find @xmath90 where the @xmath91 s are some real constants .",
    "the most notable terms are the non - analytic @xmath92 and @xmath93 terms displayed above .",
    "the remaining higher order terms are analytic and turn into regular gradients after fourier transforming to the spacetime representation .",
    "the non - analytic terms are a consequence of the gapless nodal quasiparticles in the @xmath7 superconductor .",
    "further , an analysis of the infra - red singularities of the nodal fermion fluctuations , using the field - theoretic methods of @xcite , shows that the nature of the non - analyticity in ( [ sq ] ) is robust , _",
    "i.e. _ , higher - order corrections do not modify the non - analytic power of the momentum or frequency , or introduce additional non - analyticities . in this sense , these singularities are the fermionic analog of the goldstone singularities arising from spin waves in the ordered phase of an antiferromagnet . only at the quantum critical point ,",
    "at which there is onset of @xmath75 order , are there additional higher - order corrections to ( [ sq ] ) , which then re - exponentiate to give the anomalous critical exponents as in ( [ tail ] ) @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the behavior of the low - energy action @xmath94 near the quantum critical point involving onset of @xmath75 order . at the transition , fluctuations described by @xmath95 condense , and therefore close to the transition we expect @xmath96 [ note @xmath97 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig  [ fig_didmod]a , and it is clear that the normal modes for @xmath72 are oscillations of @xmath98 and @xmath99 about zero , with the @xmath98 mode having a much lower energy .",
    "however , the non - analyticities mentioned above imply that the propagator associated with @xmath80 fluctuations does not have a simple pole structure .",
    "we have evaluated the spectral density of this propagator in the large-@xmath69 theory of ref  @xcite , and results are shown in fig  [ fig_didmod]c .",
    "there is a peak at a characteristic energy , @xmath100 , associated with the @xmath98 oscillations , but it has a rather large width in the zero - temperature limit , @xmath101 . in the opposite limit , @xmath102 , the peak narrows , but does not become a simple pole . at higher energies ,",
    "the propagators are strongly damped , and no structure is visible at an energy corresponding to @xmath99 oscillations .    moving to @xmath103 , @xmath104 acquires a finite expectation value , and the resulting landau - ginzburg free energy is illustrated in fig  [ fig_didmod]b . applying a non - zero magnetic field @xmath105 for @xmath72 has the same effect ( if we ignore vortex physics @xcite ) , _ i.e. _ , it introduces a term proportional to @xmath106 into the action , and thereby induces a finite @xmath6 order parameter component . from fig",
    "[ fig_didmod]b it is clear that the low - energy mode is still given by amplitude fluctuations of @xmath98 whereas the @xmath99 mode is high in energy .",
    "furthermore , the frequency of the @xmath98 oscillations remains @xmath105 independent for small fields @xmath105 .",
    "these results above differ from those of ref @xcite , which considers a `` clapping mode '' oscillation between the two order parameters . in our notation , as is clear from fig  [ fig_didmod]b , this mode is mainly the @xmath99 mode : we claim that near a transition to the @xmath1 state , such a mode will be at high energy and overdamped ; our symmetry analysis also shows that it is decoupled from the proper low energy mode , which is the @xmath98 oscillation .",
    "further the field independence of our normal mode frequencies does not agree with @xcite .",
    "the main reason for these discrepancies seems the absence of the @xmath107 term ( [ e1],[exprab ] ) in the landau - ginzburg free energy of ref @xcite , in their notation it would correspond to @xmath108 , which is allowed by symmetry on the square lattice ; here @xmath109 are the @xmath7 and @xmath75 order parameter components .",
    "finally , we discuss possible experimental signatures of the @xmath16 instability . a time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath1 bulk ground state has not been detected so far",
    "; so we assume that the system has @xmath72",
    ". a low - energy @xmath98 oscillation mode should be well defined close to the critical point , it is associated with chiral fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a comparison with anomalies in transport measurements ( see ref @xcite ) suggests an energy of order 20 k for this mode .",
    "therefore we expect a corresponding signal in polarized raman @xcite or neutron scattering @xcite where the use of appropriate circular polarizations allows a unique identification of chiral fluctuations .",
    "in this paper , we have reviewed theories for quantum phase transitions in @xmath0-wave superconductors which can cause strong damping of low - energy quasiparticles .",
    "all these theories are associated with a quantum critical point between a @xmath0-wave superconductor and some other superconducting state @xmath21 ( fig  [ fig_pd]b ) . to explain the strong , inelastic scattering of nodal fermions as observed in photoemission well below @xmath2 , the state @xmath21 has to be associated with a spin - singlet , zero momentum , fermion bilinear order parameter .",
    "we found that only two candidates for @xmath21 possessed a non - trivial quantum critical point , a @xmath37 or a @xmath38 superconductor , where the latter does not affect the antinodal fermions .",
    "we have also considered the damping of antinodal fermions arising from the proximity to a neel ordered state .",
    "the fermion scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations provides an explanation for the broad lineshapes and the `` peak - dip - hump '' structure seen in experiment .",
    "finally we have discussed the collective modes of a @xmath0-wave superconductor close to a zero temperature @xmath38 instability .",
    "the only observable low - energy mode is associated with amplitude fluctuations of the imaginary part of the @xmath75 order parameter component , whereas the suggested `` clapping '' mode  @xcite is found to be at high energy and overdamped .",
