    "supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies grow by accretion in which they are observed as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "x - ray emission is thought to originate in a corona surrounding the accretion disk where optical and ultraviolet photons from the disk are inverse - compton scattered to higher energies .",
    "according to conventional unified models @xcite , this central engine is enshrouded by a circumnuclear obscuring medium of dust and gas which has a toroidal geometry .",
    "the inclination of this system to the observer s line of sight therefore determines the observable properties . in this classification scheme ,",
    "type 1 agn represent a face - on system , allowing an unobscured view of the central engine where broad and narrow optical emission lines are apparent , as well as the ultraviolet continuum , mid - infrared emission from the circumnuclear obscuring matter , and x - ray emission from the corona .",
    "conversely , the type 2 systems are oriented so that the accretion disk and corona are hidden from the observer s sight line , blocking the optical and ultraviolet continuum and optical broad lines , and possibly significantly impacting the observed x - ray emission .",
    "the physical processes that x - ray photons undergo are imprinted in the observed spectrum .",
    "an x - ray photon that is injected from the corona into the obscuring medium can pass unimpeded directly into our line of sight , be absorbed , or undergo one or more compton - scatterings , with multiple scatterings becoming more likely if the column density is compton - thick ( i.e. , n@xmath4 @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the thompson cross - section for electron scattering ) .",
    "the probabilities of these outcomes depend on the column density of the reprocessor and the incident energy of the x - ray photon .",
    "fluorescent line emission from continuum photons ejecting inner shell electrons from atoms or ions in the obscuring medium can potentially be a dominant component of the observed spectrum .",
    "agn continuum photons can also not interact with the absorber by escaping through the opening of the torus and/or passing through gaps in a clumpy medium if the absorber is non - uniform and patchy , and then scatter off a more distant optically - thin medium , entering our line of sight .",
    "simple _ ad hoc _ x - ray models that parametrize the emission with an absorbed power law model or partial covering model will fail to capture the detailed physics inherent in these systems , especially when the column density exceeds @xmath7 @xmath5 , i.e. , when compton scattering becomes an important factor .",
    "even models that treat relativistic reflection off an accretion disk are unsuitable for these systems as they assume a column density that is infinite and a disk geometry does not adequately describe the absorber that reprocesses the x - ray emission .",
    "additionally , such modeling is one - dimensional , which does not allow a finite column density out of the line of sight to be measured , even though the fe k fluorescence line can provide information about the global matter distribution in which it is produced . with recent advances in spectral modeling that self - consistently treat compton scattering , fluorescent line emission , and scattering off a distant medium @xcite , we can now delve into the details of the obscuration in agn and obtain physically meaningful constraints on inclination angle , line - of - sight and global column density , and the percentage of scattered agn light .",
    "here we use physically motivated x - ray models to study the circumnuclear obscuration of a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies ( sy2s ) and type 2 quasar ( qso ) candidates selected based on their [ oiii ] 5007   line emission , where the sy2s are local ( @xmath8 ) , lower luminosity obscured agn compared with quasars , which have bolometric luminosities exceeding @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "the [ oiii ] 5007   line forms in the agn narrow line region , 100s of parsecs above and below the circumnuclear obscuring medium , and it is primarily ionized by the agn continuum , making it a reliable indicator of intrinsic agn power @xcite .",
    "these samples are thus unbiased with respect to the circumnuclear obscuration while x - ray selected samples are inherently biased against the most obscured sources as the combined effects of photoelectric absorption and compton scattering modify the observed x - ray emission .",
    "the sy2 and qso samples have previously been analyzed and published in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , using simple power law or double power law models to fit the spectrum .",
    "the amount of implied obscuration was determined by normalizing the observed x - ray flux by the intrinsic luminosity ( [ oiii ] for the sy2 and qso sample , and by the mid - infrared [ oiv ] 26 @xmath11 m line and mid - infrared continuum for the sy2 sample ) and analyzing the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath3 line , which can exceed 1 kev in compton - thick sources as the fluorescent line in the reflection spectrum is superimposed on a depressed continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also estimate the absorber column density by comparing the observed ratio of x - ray to [ oiii ] flux to a simulated unabsorbed ratio , using the unabsorbed ( type 1 agn ) values from @xcite as the basis for simulating 1000 random draws per source , and determining the column density that can account for the attenuation between the absorbed and simulated unabsorbed x - ray fluxes . in neither work is the fitted column density used as representative of the true obscuration as this is poorly determined with the simple models used . instead , the observed 2 - 10 kev fluxes and fe k@xmath3 ews , which are largely model - independent , were used as diagnostics of the column density .",
    "in both works , these obscuration proxies suggested that a majority of the sy2s and type 2 qso candidates are heavily obscured , and possibly compton - thick .    in this analysis",
    ", we use the models from @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mytorus ) to unveil the physical properties of the obscuration responsible for reprocessing the emission from the central engine within a spherical and toroidal geometry , respectively .",
    "these models treat the transmitted continuum , compton scattered emission and fluorescent line emission self - consistently , allowing for physically meaningful measurements of the global and line - of - sight column densities which are poorly determined with _ ad hoc _ models .",
    "we apply these model to the subset of [ oiii]-selected sy2s from @xcite and qso2 candidates from @xcite that have adequate signal - to - noise x - ray spectra to constrain the model parameters .",
    "we comment on what we can learn about the circumnuclear obscuration with the present data , including reliable measurements of the global as well as line - of - sight n@xmath12 , and highlight two interesting sources as revealed by our x - ray analysis . as the fe k@xmath3 emission",
    "is accommodated self - consistently within the global obscuring medium in these models , we overcome the shortcomings of previous analyses that used simple power - law modeling to measure the fe k@xmath3 emission either in front of or behind the line - of - sight absorbing screen .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also investigate whether there are differences between these qso2s and sy2s in terms of their column densities and scattering fractions and if there is a relationship between the column density and agn luminosity as posited by the `` receding torus '' model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "more recently , @xcite used the same technique on data release 6 of the sdss @xcite , which expanded the @xcite sample four - fold and included objects at @xmath27 , garnering 887 type 2 qso candidates .",

    "the three model components are fit simultaneously in xspec , where the power law index ( @xmath47 ) and normalization , line of sight column density ( n@xmath48 ) , inclination angle ( @xmath46 ) and redshift ( @xmath49 ) are tied together .",
    "the relative normalizations among the zeroth - order continuum , compton scattered component and fluorescent line emission may vary due to deviations from model assumptions ( different elemental abundances and/or torus half opening angle , an ionized rather than neutral medium ) and time delays between the transmitted and scattered component and the scattered component and line emission .",
    "such differences may not be apparent in the spectrum since it may be observed on scales where the deviations are averaged over , especially between the scattered and fluorescent line emission .",
    "these unknowns are embodied in the relative normalizations @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for the compton scattered and line emission respectively , which are parametrized by a multiplicative constant in xspec . we keep @xmath52 and @xmath53 tied together in order to preserve the self - consistency of the compton - scattered continuum and the fe k@xmath3 line emission , within the context of the assumptions of the model ( such as solar fe abundance ) .",

    "in addition to the mytorus zeroth - continuum , compton scattered , and fluorescent line emission models , we include model components for galactic absorption ( n@xmath56 ) , a multiplicative factor for the _ xmm - newton _ pn , mos1 , and mos2 detector cross - normalizations , a gaussian convolution to the fluorescent line spectrum for velocity broadening , and possibly scattering of the continuum from an optically thin medium and/or a thermal component ( if the data require these components ) , similar to the spherical absorption model .",

    "we can model the compton - scattered continuum from the global matter distribution , which may in general be unrelated to the line - of - sight column density , by decoupling the inclination angle and column density of the mytorus compton - scattered continuum component .",
    "such a scenario ( which is no longer restricted to a toroidal geometry ) can be realized if a portion of the observed x - ray emission is viewed after reflection off the back side of the obscuring medium without further interaction with this matter , mimicking a patchy medium where this reflected emission is seen through a hole .",
    "the spectrum can in fact be dominated by this unobscured reflection component .",
    "in this decoupled case , the inclination angle for the zeroth - order continuum is fixed at 90@xmath43 so that its associated column density represents the line of sight column density only ( n@xmath48 ) .",
    "there is a compton scattered component for the far - side reflection , with the inclination angle fixed at 0@xmath43 as it mimics face - on reflection , and its associated column density ( n@xmath33 ) represents the global average . like the coupled case",
    ", the normalizations and photon indices among the zeroth order continuum , the compton scattered component , and scattering off a distant medium are tied together .",
    "the absorption measured with the spherical model , n@xmath60 refers to the radial distribution of the obscuring material and so the line - of - sight column density from the spherical model is directly comparable to the line - of - sight column density , n@xmath48 , measured by mytorus .",
    "when mytorus is run in the default ( i.e. , coupled ) mode , the global column density , n@xmath33 , is the same as the line - of - sight column density . as noted above",

    "if we are able to achieve a good fit to the spectra using the spherical absorption model of @xcite , then we accept this model as the preferred model since the added complexity of a toroidal geometry will not allow meaningful constraints on the inclination angle . in some cases where a decent fit ( reduced @xmath63 ) is obtained with the spherical absorption model",
    ", mytorus provides a better fit of the fe k complex , in which case we accept the mytorus model fits as a better representation of the circumnuclear obscuration ; indeed , these fits are a statistically significantly improvement ( i.e. , @xmath54-test probability exceeds 3@xmath29 ) .",
    "though the spherical model may be preferred , this does not necessarily rule out the possibility that the absorber has a more complex geometry , but rather indicates that this latter possibility is not required to accomodate the spectrum . for the objects where the mytorus fit is preferred , we inspect the results of fitting in coupled and decoupled mode .",
    "we accept the decoupled fit only if we obtain constraints on the fit parameters ( namely @xmath52 , n@xmath48 , and n@xmath33 which can be poorly determined in decoupled mode if there is a weak or absent iron line ) or if the fe k complex is better modeled in decoupled mode .",
    "we also note that even with the addition of the _ apec _ model component , the upper limit on the best fit @xmath34 is beyond the allowable model range ( 3 for the spherical model , 2.6 for mytorus ) for a handful of objects ; in these cases , we quote the 90% confidence lower limit .    for several objects ( mrk 0609 , sdss j115704.84 + 524903.6 , sdss j123843.43 + 092736.6 , sdss j083454.89 + 553411.1 , sdss j103408.59 + 600152.2 )",
