    ", organic semiconductors are attracting increasing interesting because of their desirable properties , such as transparency , flexibility , and the prospect of economic advantage over inorganic electronics @xcite .",
    "organic materials , which may be amorphous , exhibit electrical properties which are generally qualitatively and quantitatively quite different from inorganic materials @xcite .",
    "for example , charge carriers in a time - of - flight experiment exhibit long lived , spatially dispersed structures . furthermore",
    ", the roles of the mobility and diffusion coefficients , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , are not at all clear cut , as they are in crystalline structures or gases . such anomalous or `` dispersive ''",
    "behavior arises because the scattering of charge carriers may be accompanied by trapping in localized states for times @xmath3 , as determined by a `` relaxation function '' @xmath4 , which has an asymptotic time dependence @xmath5 , with fractional exponent @xmath6 .",
    "the recent interest in `` fractional kinetics '' derives mainly from the seminal paper of scher and montroll @xcite , whose discussion in terms of a continuous time random walk has spawned an extensive literature in its own right @xcite . in this literature , it is often assumed that the charge carrier number density @xmath7 may be found as the solution of a fractional diffusion equation , which for present purposes we will refer to as the `` caputo '' form of the fractional advection diffusion equation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the caputo fractional partial derivative with respect to @xmath10 of order @xmath6 .",
    "the caputo derivative ( see appendix a ) accounts for trapping in localized states .",
    "this is appropriate for a thin sample of amorphous material confined between two large plane parallel boundaries , with all spatial variation confined to the normal direction , which defines the @xmath11 axis of a system of coordinates .",
    "in addition it is assumed that the small signal limit prevails , and that both the drift velocity @xmath12 , also directed along the @xmath11 axis , and the longitudinal diffusion coefficient @xmath2 derive entirely from an externally applied field @xmath13 . for non - dispersive transport ,",
    "@xmath14 such that @xmath15 , and eq .",
    "assumes the familiar classical form @xcite .",
    "the present article focuses on new techniques for solution of eq . for the purposes of better understanding the factors influencing experiment .    before proceeding with the detailed analysis , it is important to bear in mind that eq .",
    "is only approximate .",
    "just as the kinetic theory of classical charge carrier transport in crystalline semiconductors and gases has been developed to a sophisticated level through solution of boltzmann s kinetic equation , a more general and accurate picture of anomalous transport in amorphous media should be obtained through solution of a fractional kinetic equation in phase space , in which the microscopic collision operator accounts for scattering and trapping processes .",
    "projection onto configuration space is achieved by integration over velocity space , yielding ( with approximations ) eq . plus",
    "expressions for macroscopic properties such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the phase space approach is beyond the scope of the present work , and the reader is referred to @xcite for such considerations .",
    "whatever the medium , gaseous or condensed matter , crystalline or amorphous , the advection diffusion equation is usually assumed to provide the link between theory and experiment , its limitations not withstanding .",
    "thus , on the one hand , solution of the boltzmann kinetic equation provides theoretical values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and on the other , solution of eq . for @xmath7 , with appropriate boundary and initial conditions , enables experimental data to be unfolded to furnish empirical values of the same transport properties .",
    "comparison of theoretically derived and experimentally measured transport properties then gives information about the fundamental microscopic nature of the interaction of charge carriers with the medium including the trapping / detrapping process .",
    "this procedure is standard for electrons and ion `` swarms '' in gases @xcite , but application of the idea to amorphous media awaits the further development of fractional boltzmann phase space kinetics .",
    "that is part of our long term theoretical program , but in the meantime , we focus in the present article on the more practical imperative of developing an accurate and efficient means of solving eq . .    to this end ,",
    "a simple and numerically efficient solution of eq . would be highly desirable . previously reported solutions of fractional diffusive systems for bounded media have been expressed in terms of infinite series solutions @xcite .",
    "we show that the series solution to eq . with absorbing boundaries may be collapsed into a simple closed form solution in laplace space by building upon the experience gained in solution of the non - dispersive diffusion equation in gaseous electronics , specifically , for the pulsed radiolysis drift tube experiment @xcite .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows : in section ii , we model the time of flight experiment @xcite and obtain a formal analytic solution of eq . as a series of mittag - leffler functions , which is cast into a tractable form , suitable for practical purposes , using the poisson summation theorem . in section iii , we express the current measured in a time - of - flight experiment in terms of this analytic solution , and show analytically that sums of the slopes in distinct time regimes add up to -2 on a log - log plot , as first predicted by scher and montroll @xcite and as observed in many experiments @xcite . in section iv , we explore the way that current varies with experimental parameters , and go on to fit selected experimental data .",
    "we show that our solution demonstrates the power - law decay characteristic of dispersive transport .",
    "in this article , we will use eq . to model a disordered semiconductor in a time of flight experiment @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the various forms of the fractional advection diffusion equation using both caputo and riemann - liouville forms of the fractional derivative operator are discussed in appendix a. a one dimensional equation , such as , is appropriate for a thin sample of disordered material confined between two large plane parallel boundaries , which we shall take to be at @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",

    "as is well known , fractional models obey a correspondence principle , where non - fractional behavior is recovered in appropriate limits . in this case , in the limit @xmath14 the mittag - leffler function reduces to an exponential , i.e. @xmath30 , and reduces to eq .",
