    "the simulation results show that this ratio has a strong dependence on wavenumber .",

    "at @xmath37 there is a  2.5% difference between the linear theory growth rates in the two models .",
    "however , at this level , the measured ratios @xmath49 are indistinguishable on the very largest scales @xmath50mpc ( green dotted and blue dashed horizontal lines ) . at @xmath51 and @xmath52",

    "further we vary the maximum wavenumber , @xmath70 , used in the fit and plot the recovered growth rate as a function of @xmath70 in fig .",

    "we find that models based on linear theory fail to recover the correct value of the growth rate .",
    "a quasi - linear model including non - linear velocity divergence terms is far more accurate and allows us to distinguish between these competing cosmologies .",
    "even though we consider large scales , there are important departures from linear theory which can only be modelled by n - body simulation @xcite . without such guidance ,",
    "the application of models based on linear theory could lead to systematic errors of the same order as the difference in @xmath60 between competing cosmologies . in this event",

    "this model can be applied to the measured power spectrum over a wider range of scales than those based on linear theory , making better use of the available data .",
