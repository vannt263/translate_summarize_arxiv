    "[ imager ]    gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are highly transient and powerful cosmological events appearing in the sky for very short times ( from a few milli - seconds to hundreds of seconds ) . they are considered to be associated to the death of massive stars @xcite or compact object mergers @xcite .",
    "past and current space missions dedicated to the study of grbs have demonstrated that the most efficient way to detect and localise them in the hard x - ray and gamma - ray domain is to use wide - field coded - mask cameras .",
    "c +    we present here the main instrument of the science payload on - board the international grb mission svom ( space variable object monitor ) @xcite , the coded - mask camera for x- and gamma - rays ( cxg ) responsible for triggering grb observations in the 4 - 250 kev energy band and their localisation with an accuracy better than 10 arc - minutes in the 4 - 50 kev imaging band .",
    "svom , which is the evolution of the mission _ eclairs _",
    "@xcite from micro- to mini - satellite , is dedicated to the study of high - redshift grbs .",
    "it is expected to be launched in 2013 .",
    "the cxg has a large field of view ( fov @xmath1 2 sr ) .",
    "the cxg passive shielding is designed so that the background photons coming from outside the fov will be completely absorbed by the compounds of the shielding ( see section  [ svom ] and fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . the detection plane , dpix @xcite with an effective area of 1024",
    "@xmath2 is an assembly of 200 elementary modules ( xrdpix ) equipped with 32 cdte schottky detectors ( @xmath3mm@xmath4 , 1 mm thickness ) produced by acrorad co. ltd in japan ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "each xrdpix is read out by the very low noise front - end asic idef - x @xcite , which will enable the camera to reach a low - energy threshold of @xmath5kev after careful selection of the 6400 cdte detectors of the detection plane ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "first lab measurements using a cdte detector coupled with idef - x reported a low - energy threshold around 2.7 kev ( see fig.4 in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is a significant technological improvement when compared to the 12 - 15 kev low - energy threshold of the _ swift _ bat ( burst alert telescope ) or integral / isgri ( integral soft gamma - ray imager ) using similar detectors .",
    "the cxg is currently in a b phase at the cnes ( centre national detudes spatiales , the french space agency ) .",
    "coded - mask cameras such as the cxg are known to be photon background - dominated instruments due to their large fov and effective area .",
    "even if grbs have high signal - to - noise ratios , it is still of primary importance to evaluate the camera background expected in orbit during the early phases of the design in order to optimise the instrument capability to observe grbs as well as non grb targets .",
    "this paper focuses on the estimation of the background spectrum of the cxg camera , depending on its design and mission parameters , and the impact on the scientific performances of the mission .",
    "this paper is organised as follows :    * we give a brief description of the monte - carlo simulator , geant , as well as the main components of the space environment that the spacecraft will encounter once in orbit , used to perform our simulations .",
    "we also define the mass model of the cxg camera used to perform our simulations .",
    "* we discuss the main features of the background spectrum .",
    "we also compute the camera limiting sensitivity for grbs , and we compare it with those obtained with other grb trigger instruments .",
    "we investigate what impact on the camera performance would have the existence of a dead layer on the detectors . *",
    "we present the main conclusions of the paper and discuss further improvements .",
    "the simulations were performed using the cern monte - carlo code geant , initially designed to model the interactions between matter and particles in high - energy nuclear physics experiments .",
    "geant has since been used in the astrophysical field to model the performance of space instruments such as spi ( spectrometer on integral ) on - board integral @xcite and fermi / glast @xcite , for instance .",
    "geant enables us to : i ) describe the detailed mass model of the payload and the spacecraft ; ii ) draw particles ( photons , electrons , protons , neutrons , ... ) following a specific spatial and energy distribution ; iii ) track the paths of the primary particles through the body of the camera and the spacecraft as well as any secondary particles generated during the different physical processes such as compton , rayleigh scattering , photo - electric effects , pair annihilation and creation , nuclear interaction .",
    "the simulations were performed using the release 4.9.1 of the geant4 c@xmath6 toolkit @xcite along with the low energy electromagnetic physics dataset .",
    "svom is a leo mission with an altitude of 600 km and an inclination of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the satellite will then be subject to different sources of background in space : extragalactic components ( x - ray and gamma - ray diffuse background , primary proton and electron cosmic rays ) and near earth components ( gamma - ray albedo , neutrons , secondary protons located under the radiation belt ) . at the moment",
    ", we only take into account the extragalactic diffuse background , because it is the most relevant source of background for the study presented here ( see section  [ bkgs ] ) .",
    "the main source of background radiation for a wide - field camera is the quasi - isotropic cosmic x-/gamma - ray background @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the cosmic background that we used is from @xcite ( from 10 kev to 2 mev ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the _ swift_-bat agrees within 8% with the normalisation of the cosmic background spectrum given in @xcite below 2 mev .    the cosmic background spectrum measured by _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , rxte @xcite and _ chandra _",
    "@xcite seems to be larger by 25 - 40% in the 2 - 10 kev energy range when compared to the spectrum given in @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the discrepancies between the different instruments in this energy band may be related to systematic errors in the response function used for diffuse sources .",
    "however , this discrepancy needs to be confirmed ( see @xcite ) .    for our simulations , we decided to extend the shape of the cosmic background spectrum given in @xcite below 10 kev .",
    "we considered a @xmath8 sr spatial distribution for the cosmic background photons in our simulations since the earth acts like a screen on the other hemisphere .",
    "grbs are assumed to be point - like sources with a spectral distribution given by the band s function @xcite as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is in units of photons @xmath11 s@xmath12 kev@xmath12 and the peak energy @xmath13 is the energy for which the radiated energy reaches a maximum .",
    "below we describe the specifications of the mass model of the cxg camera used to perform the simulations following the mass and dimension restrictions of the svom mission .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     on - board the svom mission ( see fig .  [ fig_eclairs ] ) , the detection plane consists of @xmath14 1mm - thick cdte pixels with a useful width of 4  mm , leading to an effective area of @xmath15 .",
    "the ceramics supporting the detector and the asic are taken into account in the simulations",
    ". however , the high voltage grid is not modelled .",
    "made of a ta - w alloy , the @xmath16 thick and 54  cm wide coded mask , whose presently square pattern contains 30 percent open cells , is located about 46  cm above the detectors , which provides the instrument with a field of view of 2  sr .",
    "the mass model also includes a multi - layer thermal coating insulation ( mli ) above the coded mask to prevent optical photon loading on the detection plane , the ta6v upper- and lower supports of the mask , as well as simplified versions of the cold plate in albemet and the readout electronics box .",
    "after simulations , we chose a graded shield combining pb , cu and al , which is a trade - off between a maximum reduction of the background in the 4 - 50  kev energy band , mass budget considerations and the necessity to keep a few instrumental gamma - ray lines at higher energies for calibration purposes , especially lead k@xmath17 and k@xmath18 fluorescence lines .",
    "the remainder of the satellite is assumed to be a @xmath19 300  kg cube of pseudo - aluminium , which has an averaged density defined as the ratio of the spacecraft mass over its volume , the exact structure of the spacecraft being not yet known with accuracy .",
    "fig .  [ fig_bkg_eclairs ] shows the spectrum of the background measured on the detection plane resulting from our monte - carlo simulations in the 4 kev-300 kev energy range .",
    "the spectrum is degraded to the resolution of the cdte detectors using a gaussian with a fwhm of @xmath20 kev as measured in the cesr lab facility .",
    "the presence of the mli layer on top of the coded mask results in a decrease of the background level at low energy , since it absorbs a fraction of the incident low - energy photons .",
    "thus , the mli layer is responsible for decreasing the background level by @xmath21 , in the 4 - 50 kev energy band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_bkg_deadlayer ] ) . the compounds and thicknesses of the passive shielding and the coded mask ,",
    "as summarised in table  [ tab1 ] , lead to the apparition of several fluorescence lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_bkg_eclairs ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_tab2 ] ; the line characteristics in fig .",
    "[ fig_tab2 ] are from @xcite ) .",
    "the intensity of the au fluorescence lines coming from the electronics is likely to be overestimated due to the crude modelling of the electronics in our simulations at the moment . k@xmath17 and",
    "k@xmath18 fluorescence lines from the cd and te are also seen in the background spectrum .",
    "the most intense instrumental lines ( pb - ta lines ) will be used to calibrate the gain of the detection plane in orbit . to ensure a better control on the gain over the energy band of the cxg camera ( 4 - 250 kev )",
    ", we are investigating the benefit of considering some fluorescence lines at low energy ( for instance , cu k@xmath17 8.04 kev ) without degrading too much the scientific performances of the camera . from the simulations",
    ", we checked that the efficiency of the passive shielding to block the photon background outside the camera field of view is 100% in the 4 - 50 kev imaging band as required .",
    "the averaged background count rate in the 4 - 50 kev imaging band is 1.7 counts @xmath11 s@xmath12 .",
    "in addition to the external background ( the x - ray diffuse background ) , the camera will present an internal background mainly due to charged particles interacting with the body of the camera .",
    "even if we did not yet perform detailled simulations to model this background component , we can estimate that the cxg background should be dominated in the 4 - 50 kev imaging band ( i.e. the relevant energy band here ) by the x - ray diffuse background outside the saa ( south atlantic anomaly ) .",
    "simulations outside the saa on a previous design of the cxg camera to be embarked on - board the micro - satellite _ eclairs _ showed that the transition between the internal ( due to primary and secondary protons , primary electrons , neutrons and gamma - ray albedo ) and external background ( due to x - ray diffuse background ) was expected to be around 100 kev @xcite .",
    "note that the two missions have similar orbital parameters ( same altitude , but an inclination of @xmath22 for _ eclairs _ instead of @xmath7 for svom ) and the mass model of the _ eclairs_-cxg camera is fairly similar to that used on - board svom , and the compounds in both mass models have similar @xmath23-values .",
    "the mass ratio of the cxg camera between svom and _ eclairs _ is 4.2 .",
    "we could then expect the internal background of the svom - cxg camera to be roughly four times larger than that computed for the _ eclairs_-cxg .",
    "this would result in a transition between the internal and external background to be around 70 - 90 kev .",
    "we used the formalism described in @xcite to compute the 1 - 1000 kev limiting sensitivity of the camera ( @xmath24 ) for different energy ranges of the cxg camera as a function of the grb parameter , @xmath25 .",
    "this enables us to compare directly the expected grb sensitivity of the cxg with respect to other present and future grb instruments @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sens_grb ] ) . to do so",
    ", we considered : i ) grb spectra with @xmath26 and @xmath27 which are the averaged values derived from the batse @xmath17 and @xmath18 distributions ; ii ) grbs located on the camera axis and an integration time of 1.0s .",
    "we used a trigger threshold of @xmath28 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig_sens_grb ] , it appears that the instrument isgri on - board integral is the most sensitive instrument .",
    "however , its field of view is much smaller than that of the _",
    "swift_-bat , superagile , fermi - gbm and svom - cxg .",
    "the cxg will be more sensitive to grbs with @xmath29 kev than most of the present and future high - energy instruments except isgri , and hence , to high - redshift grbs of which the prompt radiation should peak mostly in x - rays .",
    "that is mainly due to the lower energy threshold of the cxg of @xmath30 kev ( see fig .  [ fig_sens_thr ] ) instead of 15 kev for the _",
    "swift_-bat for instance .",
    "however , the effective area of the cxg being less than that of the _ swift_-bat ( 5200 @xmath2 ) , the cxg will be less sensitive than the _ swift_-bat to grbs with @xmath31 kev . taking into account a broader energy range for the cxg background will only result in a slight improvement of the cxg sensitivity at higher @xmath25-values .",
    "the cxg will also be more sensitive to grbs with @xmath32kev than the gbm on - board fermi / glast .",
    "@xcite reviewed the performance of current and future grb missions to detect high - redshift grbs .",
    "their table  1 shows that the current design of the svom - cxg may be enabled to detect 2 - 4 grbs with a redshift larger than 6 per year .      until then",
    ", we assumed all the cdte detectors in the detection plane were described as pure cdte crystals .",
    "we then did not model the schottky contact on each detector ( the anode ) made of a @xmath33 nm thick indium ( in ) layer @xmath34 @xmath35nm - thick titanium ( ti ) layer and the cathode made of a @xmath36 nm platinum ( pt ) layer .",
    "the ti layer is added to reinforce the stability of the in layer .",
    "figure  [ fig_pixel ] shows a scheme of a cdte detector .",
    "the incident photons will penetrate the detectors on the cathode .",
    "the pt layer acts then like a dead layer on top the active volume of the detector . even if this pt layer is thin",
    ", it will absorb a significant fraction of low - energy photons , since the pt layer results in an absorption of @xmath37 at 4 kev and @xmath38 at 6 kev ( see fig  [ fig_eff ] ) . above 20 kev ,",
    "the absorption is less than 5% .",
    "a full characterisation of the pt dead layer thickness for each detector is under investigation at the cesr lab facility @xcite . in order to quantify the impact of such a dead layer on the cxg performance , we run monte - carlo simulations including a @xmath39nm - thick pt dead layer on top each of pixels to model the cathode and a @xmath40 nm thick indium ( in ) layer @xmath34 @xmath41nm - thick titanium ( ti ) layer to model the anode .",

    "[ fig_bkg_deadlayer ] shows the background spectrum of the cxg in the 4 - 50 kev energy band in three cases : without the mli layer and the pt dead layer ( square  case@xmath42 ) ; with the mli layer , but without the pt dead layer ( crosses  case@xmath43 ) ; with both ( triangles  case@xmath44 ) .",
    "the effects of the mli and dead layer are clearly visible at low energy .",
    "the introduction of the dead layer in our simulations results in a 40% decrease in the background level at 4 kev .",
    "the count rate level is then @xmath45 counts @xmath11 s@xmath12 in the 4 - 50 kev energy band ( _ i.e. _ a 12% reduction with respect to the value found without the pt cathode ) .    c    fig .",

    "the impact of the pt dead layer on the cxg performance is not significant enough to change the main remarks drawn in section  [ sensitivity ] .",
