    "however , the magnification in the lower panel shows a fine structure with transition from the f - state to the higher - energy vg state above @xmath208 .",
    "in fact , there is a crossover from the f to vg state .",

    "lower panel : energy and singularity fraction at @xmath66.,width=302 ]    we also have performed the heating - cooling experiment for a @xmath10 heisenberg model .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - m_annealing_vs_t_3d_h_l=00003d00003d256_hr=00003d00003d1_pbc ] are similar to those for the @xmath0 model above .",
    "since hedgehogs in the heisenberg model carry much less energy than the vortex loops in the @xmath0 model , the energy of the hedgehog - glass ( hg ) is only slightly above that of the f - state .",
    "we have presented a comparative study of glassy states of three - dimensional @xmath0 and heisenberg random - field models .",
    "the @xmath0 spin model is conceptually similar to the model of a pinned flux lattice , even though the symmetry of the two models is slightly different .",
    "@xcite the heisenberg rf model has practical implementation in antiferromagnets with quenched disorder .",
    "@xcite some of the properties of the two models may be also relevant to properties of amorphous and sintered magnets , although there are very significant differences between the effects of the random field and random anisotropy .",
    "earlier we have found that the properties of the random - field model are controlled by topology .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath3-component spin in @xmath6 dimensions the reversible behavior with exponential decay of correlations occurs at @xmath7 when topological defects are absent . at @xmath154",
    "the random - field system possesses pinned topological defects and exhibits glassy behavior .",
    "the focus of this paper has been on the properties of the f - state obtained by relaxation from the initially ordered state .",
    "one of our main findings is a profound difference between the f - states of the @xmath0 model and the heisenberg model .",
    "while the latter can easily be transformed into a lower energy state with @xmath92 by applying an appropriate hysteresis cycle , the @xmath0 f - state appears robust against attempts to lower its energy and decrease the magnetization at the same time .",
    "this can be traced to the inevitable presence of topological defects in the @xmath92 state at @xmath154 .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath10 heisenberg model such defects are hedgehogs that have relatively low energy as compared to the vortex loops in the @xmath10 @xmath0 model .",
    "it is the reluctance of the @xmath0 rf system to form high - energy vortex loops that makes the f - state robust with respect to disordering .",
    "our other interesting finding is that the f - state possesses memory of the initial state .",
    "there is an infinite number of f - states that differ from each other by the direction of the global magnetic moment determined by the initial ordered state that the f - state has evolved from .",
    "unlike in a ferromagnet with the exchange interaction only , these states are separated by energy barriers due to the random field . small rotation of the magnetization of the f - state reveals its elasticity : rotation generates forces that return @xmath215 to its original direction .",
    "this makes one wonder whether the f - state has any relevance to the elastic glass discussed in the past .",
    "@xcite    we have also studied the effect of temperature on the f - state .",
    "naively , one would expect that it can be easily annealed towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "our results do not support this expectation . while heating helps to depin topological defects",
    ", it also creates the new ones .",
    "annealing of the vortex glass state does result in the lower vorticity and lower energy but it can not eliminate vortices completely . on the contrary , heating and cooling of the f - state generates vortex loops that have been completely absent at the beginning .",
    "this reduces the magnetization but also leads to the higher energy than the energy of the f - state not subjected to the heating - cooling procedure .",
    "the bottom line is that the rf system , when cooled down after exposure to elevated temperature , behaves as a glass .",
    "it stores the thermal energy in the form of pinned topological defects .",
    "there is a deep analogy between this state and the state of a conventional bulk ferromagnet with defects . in the case of the conventional ferromagnet",
    "the magnetization and the internal dipolar field adjust self - consistently through equations of magnetostatics . in a similar manner ,",
    "the magnetization of the rf system adjusts self - consistently to the average random field .",
    "when cooled in a zero field below the curie temperature , a conventional ferromagnet ends up in a state with small domains and high energy dominated by pinned domain walls .",
    "similarly , the rf magnet ends up with many pinned topological defects : vortex loops in the @xmath0 model and hedgehogs in the heisenberg model .",
    "when relaxing from a magnetized state at a sufficiently low temperature , a conventional ferromagnet ends up in a state with a finite magnetization because domain walls can not easily penetrate in the magnet due to pinning and , thus , can not form the @xmath92 ground state . in a similar manner , the rf magnet ends up in the f - state when it relaxes from the ordered initial state .",
    "there are significant differences though as well .",
    "the @xmath92 ground state of a conventional ferromagnet is the minimum of magnetostatic energy that has not been considered in the context of the rf system studied by us and by other authors .",
    "it is not at all obvious whether the @xmath0 system in the f - state can lower its energy by accommodating a large vortex loop that would reduce the magnetization to zero .",
    "although there may be little profit in discussing the ground state of the glassy system , some remarks are in order .",
    "the imry - ma argument is clearly qualitatively valid as long as the @xmath92 state does not require topological defects .",
    "@xcite at @xmath154 the argument becomes less obvious as the i m domains can not be formed without topological defects . on the first glance",
    ", it appears that topological defects only modify the i m argument but do not destroy it .",
    "indeed , in @xmath10 there would be roughly one vortex loop per i m domain of size @xmath128 .",
    "the energy of the loop would be of order @xmath216 , that corresponds to the energy @xmath217 per spin .",
    "this modifies the exchange energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : imry - ma ] ) by a factor proportional to @xmath218 and leads to a greater but still finite @xmath14 in the disordered state .",
    "finally , the energy gain of the i m state becomes strongly reduced , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eim_vortex_loops ] ) .",
    "at the same time , the i m energy in the vortex - free f - state of the @xmath10 @xmath0 model , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : imry - ma - phi ] ) and below , remains of the same order as the regular i m energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - im - d ] ) .    for the @xmath10 heisenberg model ,",
    "the energy of a hedgog in the domain of size @xmath128 is @xmath219 , which modifies the exhange energy per spin and the resulting i m energy by a factor of order unity .",
    "thus estimations for the energies of the disordered states and the f - states are the same . making hysteresis loops with decreasing amplitude converts the f - state into a disordered state of a lower energy .",
    "this indicates that the ground state of the @xmath10 heisenberg model may be disordered in spite of hedgehogs .",
    "one shoud note that in the presence of topological defects the i m argument becomes less precise as it ignores misalignment of the spin field with the average random field due to defects , as well as the interaction between topological defects .",
    "there is also a scaling argument that makes the i m argument even less obvious .",
    "indeed , the i m argument relies on the large size of i m domains in which the direction of the magnetization follows the rf field averaged over the volume of the domain .",
    "it implies smooth rotation of the magnetization from one domain to the other .",
    "the agument would not apply to the case in which the rf field @xmath29 at each cite of a @xmath10 cubic lattice is of the order of the exchange field @xmath46 created by the neighboring spins , because it would be difficult to say without direct computation whether the effect of the rf would win over the effect of the exchange . in this connection",
    ", one should notice that by considering blocks of spins of size @xmath220 satisfying @xmath221 , the original problem decribed by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - discrete ] ) can be rescaled to the problem described by the same hamiltonian with the rescaled @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 .",
    "this gives the same expression for the correlation length , @xmath225 .",
    "for the blocks of size @xmath226 one has @xmath227 in the rescaled problem .",
    "this shows that the existence of a small parameter @xmath228 in the original problem with weak rf may be an illusion .",
    "the original problem with @xmath229 is mathematically equivalent to the rescaled problem in which the local exchange field and the rf field are of the same order of magnitude . at @xmath230",
    "the spins obviously align with the rf , yielding the state with @xmath92 .",
    "the question , therefore , is whether decreasing @xmath29 from @xmath231 would result in the bifurcation or the ground state to a non - zero @xmath79 at some @xmath232 .",
    "this is suggested by figs .",
    "[ fig - m_vs_hr_l=00003d00003d512 ] and [ fig - m_vs_hr_n=00003d00003d3_l=00003d00003d512_pbc ] .",
    "the answer for the ground state may depend on the number of spin components @xmath3 .",
    "however , looking for the ground state in a glassy system requires a different numerical algorithm based on the global energy minimization . whether this is worth the effort is another question",
