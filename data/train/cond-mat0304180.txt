    "the treatment of long - range interacting systems remains a challenging issue in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "serious theoretical difficulties arise because internal energy , entropy and other thermodynamic quantities are no longer additive , i.e. a part of a system has not the same thermodynamic properties of the whole .",
    "this originates unusual effects , like negative specific heat and the inequivalence of statistical ensembles even in the limit of infinite number of particles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review emphasizing different examples such as gravitation , plasmas , fluid mechanics ,  ) .",
    "relevant physical examples displaying such anomalies are known in newtonian gravity but also in plasma physics ( although in the latter case the screening of attractive and repulsive coulomb interactions may mitigate them ) .    as usual in theoretical physics , the study of simple toy models proves to be of major importance to attack more complex and realistic systems .",
    "in particular , simple mean - field models with infinite - range interactions turned out to be extremely useful . in spite of the fact that they are constantly used in statistical mechanics to describe cooperative phenomena , it is somehow singular that violation of additivity has hardly been recognized in the past .",
    "a reason for that lies perhaps in the fact that the thermodynamic limit is performed resorting to saddle - point techniques , which puts the hamiltonian in the explicitly decoupled form , thus hiding the difficulties inherent in the long - range interaction .",
    "indeed , ensemble inequivalence ( for example between microcanonical and canonical ensemble ) has been observed , producing effects like negative specific heats , which are the counterparts of the ones known in the gravitational context  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such models is that their canonical thermodynamics can be exactly derived by performing the mean - field limit ( the infinite @xmath2 limit at fixed volume ) , which is a reasonable surrogate of the thermodynamic limit ( the infinite @xmath2 limit at fixed density ) .",
    "contrary to the usual belief , an exact microcanonical solution is also feasible for such non trivial hamiltonians , using large deviations techniques  @xcite , but the results will be presented elsewhere  @xcite . here , for what concerns the microcanonical ensemble , we will mainly limit ourselves to show the result of numerical simulations , which , because of the mean - field nature of the interaction , require _ only _ @xmath3 codes ( instead of the usual @xmath4 ) . moreover , further insight can be gained from solving the one - dimensional collisionless boltzmann - poisson equation for the single - particle distribution function , which becomes exact in the @xmath5 limit ( at all finite times )  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate , both analytically and numerically , two simple mean - field models which we denote as  @xmath6 \" and  @xmath7 \" , which display respectively second ( @xmath6 ) and first and second order phase transitions separated by tricritical points ( @xmath7 ) in the canonical ensemble . of the former model ,",
    "we investigate in addition the dynamical formation of clustered states at low temperatures and we study their destabilization .",
    "the presence of quasi - stationary out - of - equilibrium states is moreover revealed close to the second order phase transition , in analogy with what is found for the hamiltonian - mean - field ( hmf ) model ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . concerning the @xmath7-model , we study the phase diagram in the canonical ensemble and we report numerical simulations of hysteretic effects near first - order phase transitions .",
    "we point out the existence of a narrow region of negative specific heat .",
    "let us first consider the following hamiltonian @xmath8 - { \\theta \\over 2n}\\sum_{i , j=1}^n   q_iq_j\\quad , \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the conjugate momentum of the variable @xmath10 , which defines the position of the @xmath11-th particle on a line .",
    "this is a mean field model since all particles are connected to all others , and the summation in the last term is _ not _ restricted to neighboring particles .",
    "notice that positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) values of the parameter @xmath12 correspond to attractive ( resp .",
    "repulsive ) mean - field interactions .",
    "all variables are adimensional and , for the sake of comparison , we have used the same parametrization introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which can be shown to be minimal by conveniently rescaling the variables and time ) .",
    "the local potential displays a double well for @xmath13 and a single well otherwise .",
    "the ground - state energy per particle is @xmath14 for positive @xmath12 ( all particles in a single cluster ) and @xmath15 in the repulsive case ( double cluster ) .",
    "we study the dynamics of particle released with a water bag  @xcite initial condition where positions and momenta are uniformly distributed at random in the intervals @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we have adopted the symplectic 6th - order yoshida s algorithm  @xcite , with a time step @xmath20 , which allows us to obtain an energy conservation with a relative accuracy @xmath21 ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "[ cluster ] shows the result : a coherent oscillating cluster self - consistently moving in the self - generated potential .",
    "the data are obtained for an initial condition with a small velocity dispersion , i.e. @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . besides the oscillation of the center , the particles display a rotating motion around it , which creates a spiral structure ( see figs .",
    "[ cluster2 ] ) , as frequently encountered in long range systems ; we have found this coherent behavior for a very large collection of initial states .",
    "notice that the spiral structure in the center is responsible for the very large peaks in the single particle density ( right panels in figs .",
    "[ cluster2 ] ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been described successfully for the antiferromagnetic hmf model in terms of shock waves @xcite by considering the associated vlasov equation valid in the @xmath27 limit ."
