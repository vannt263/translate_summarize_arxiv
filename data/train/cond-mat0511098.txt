    "recent progress in the fabrication of nanostructures has provided a wide variety of well - controlled vortex - confinement topologies , including different types of regular pinning arrays .",
    "a main fundamental question in this field is how to drastically increase vortex pinning , and thus the critical current @xmath0 , using artificially - produced periodic arrays of pinning sites ( aps ) .",
    "these periodic aps have been extensively used for studying vortex pinning and vortex dynamics . in particular ,",
    "enhanced @xmath0 and commensurability effects have been demonstrated in superconducting thin films with square and triangular arrays of sub-@xmath9 m holes ( i.e. , antidots ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , blind antidots ( i.e. , holes which partially perforate the film to a certain depth ) @xcite , or pinning arrays with field - dependent pinning strength @xcite , provide more flexibility for controlling properties such as pinning strength , anisotropy , etc .",
    "the increase and , more generally , control of the critical current @xmath0 in superconductors by its patterning ( perforation ) can be of practical importance for applications in micro- and nanoelectronic devices .",
    "a peak in the critical current @xmath2 , for a given value of the magnetic flux , say @xmath10 , can be engineered using a superconducting sample with a periodic aps with a matching field @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the area of the pinning cell ) , corresponding to one trapped vortex per pinning site .",
    "however , this peak in @xmath2 , while useful to obtain , _ decreases very quickly _ for fluxes away from @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the desired peak in @xmath2 is _ too narrow _ and not very robust against changes in @xmath1",
    ". it would be greatly desirable to have samples with aps with _ many _ periods .",
    "this multiple - period aps sample would provide either very many peaks or an extremely broad peak in @xmath2 , as opposed to just one ( narrow ) main peak ( and its harmonics ) .",
    "we achieve this goal ( a very broad @xmath2 ) here by studying samples with many built - in periods .",
    "the development of new fabrication technologies for pinning arrays with controllable parameters allows to fabricate not only periodic ( square or triangular ) but also more complicated _ quasiperiodic _ ( qp ) arrays of pinning sites , including _",

    "it has been shown , in particular , that there exist two types of the wave functions , self - similar ( fractal ) and non - self - similar ( chaotic ) which show `` critical '' or `` exotic '' behavior @xcite . by both numerical ( non - perturbative ) and analytical ( perturbative ) approaches , it has been demonstrated @xcite that the phonon and electronic spectra of 1d quasicrystals exhibit a self - similar hierarchy of gaps and localized states in the gaps . the existence of gaps , and gap states , in qp gaas - algaas superlattices has been predicted and found experimentally .",
    "along with studying the structural , electronic and acoustic properties of qp structures , considerable progress has been reached in understanding the superconducting properties of 2d quasicrystalline arrays @xcite .",
    "the effect of frustration , induced by a magnetic field , on the superconducting diamagnetic properties has been revealed and the superconducting - to - normal phase boundaries , @xmath13 , have been calculated for several geometries with quasicrystalline order , in a good agreement with experimentally measured phase boundaries @xcite . a comprehensive analysis of superconducting wire networks including quasicrystalline geometries and josephson - junction arrays in a magnetic field has been presented in refs  @xcite .",
    "an analytical approach @xcite was introduced to analyze the structures which are present in phase diagrams for a number of geometries .",
    "it has been shown that the gross structure is determined by the statistical distributions of the cell areas , and that the fine structures are determined by correlations among neighboring cells in the lattices .",
    "the effect of thermal fluctuations on the structure of the phase diagram has been studied @xcite by a cluster mean - field calculation and using real - space renormalization group .    in this paper , we study another phenomenon related to superconducting properties of quasiperiodic systems , namely , vortex pinning by 1d qp chains and by 2d arrays of pinning sites located at the nodes of qp lattices ( e.g. , a five - fold penrose lattice ) .",
    "it should be noted that in superconducting networks the areas of the network plaquettes play a dominant role @xcite .",
    "however , for vortex pinning by qp pinning arrays , the specific geometry of the elements which form the qp lattice and their arrangement ( and not just the areas ) are important , making the problem complicated .    in sec .",

    "we analyze changes of the function @xmath2 during a continuous transition from a periodic triangular lattice of pinning sites to the penrose lattice . based on detailed considerations of the structure and specific local rules of construction of the penrose lattice",
    ", we predict the main features of the function @xmath2 . numerical simulations with different finite - size penrose lattices confirm the predicted main features for large - size lattices , that is important for possible experimental observations of the revealed quasiperiodic features .",
    "we also obtain analytical results supporting our conclusions .",
    "moreover , we also discuss the changes in the critical current by adding either a `` quasiperiodic '' modulation or random displacements to initially periodic pinning arrays .",
    "we model a three - dimensional ( 3d ) slab infinitely long in the @xmath14-direction , by a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ( in the @xmath15-plane ) simulation cell with periodic boundary conditions , assuming the vortex lines are parallel to the cell edges .",
    "to study the dynamics of moving vortices driven by a lorentz force , interacting with each other and with pinning centers , we perform simulated annealing simulations by numerically integrating the overdamped equations of motion ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the total force per unit length acting on vortex @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the forces due to vortex - vortex and vortex - pin interactions , respectively , @xmath21 is the thermal stochastic force , and @xmath22 is the driving force acting on the @xmath18-th vortex ; @xmath23 is the viscosity , which is set to unity .",
    "the force due to the interaction of the @xmath18-th vortex with other vortices is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of vortices , @xmath26 is a modified bessel function , @xmath27 is the magnetic field penetration depth , @xmath28 and @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "it is convenient , following the notation used in ref .",
    "@xcite , to express all the lengths in units of @xmath27 and all the fields in units of @xmath31 .",
    "the bessel function @xmath32 decays exponentially for @xmath33 greater than @xmath27 , therefore it is safe to cut off the ( negligible ) force for distances greater than @xmath34 .",
    "the logarithmic divergence of the vortex - vortex interaction forces for @xmath35 is eliminated by using a cutoff for distances less than @xmath36 .",
    "vortex pinning is modeled by short - range parabolic potential wells located at positions @xmath37 .",
    "the pinning force is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of pinning sites , @xmath40 is the maximum pinning force of each potential well , @xmath41 is the range of the pinning potential , @xmath42 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath43    the temperature contribution to eq .",
    "( [ eqmd ] ) is represented by a stochastic term obeying the following conditions : @xmath44 and @xmath45    the ground state of a system of moving vortices is obtained as follows .",
    "first , we set a high value for the temperature , to let vortices move randomly .",
    "then , the temperature is gradually decreased down to @xmath46 .",
    "when cooling down , vortices interacting with each other and with the pinning sites adjust themselves to minimize the energy , simulating the field - cooled experiments @xcite .    in order to find the critical depinning current , @xmath0",
    ", we apply an external driving force gradually increasing from @xmath47 up to a certain value @xmath48 , at which all the vortices become depinned and start to freely move . for values of the driving force just above @xmath49",
    ", the total current of moving vortices @xmath50 becomes nonzero .",
    "here , @xmath51 is the normalized ( per vortex ) average velocity of all the vortices moving in the direction of the applied driving force . in numerical simulations",
    ", this means that , in practice , one should define some threshold value @xmath52 larger than the noise level .",
    "values larger than @xmath52 are then considered as nonzero currents .",
    "however , instead using this criterion - sensitive scheme , we can use an alternative approach based on potential energy considerations . in case of deep short - range potential wells ,",
    "the energy required to depin vortices trapped by pinning sites is proportional to the number of pinned vortices , @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , in this approximation we can define the `` critical current '' as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant , and study the dimensionless value @xmath56 ( further on , the primes will be omitted ) . throughout this work ,",
    "we use narrow potential wells as pinning sites , characterized by @xmath57 to @xmath36 .",
    "our calculations show that , for the parameters used , the dependence of the critical current @xmath2 defined according to eq .",
    "( [ jc ] ) , is in good agreement to that based on the above general definition of @xmath0 ( which involves an adjustable parameter @xmath52 ) .",
    "the advantages of using @xmath0 defined by eq .",
    "( [ jc ] ) are the following : it ( i ) does not involve any arbitrary threshold @xmath52 and ( ii ) is less cpu - time consuming , allowing the study of very large - size lattices .",
    "moreover , the goal of this study is to reveal specific matching effects between a ( periodic ) vortex lattice and arrays of qp pinning sites , and to study how the quasiperiodicity manifests itself in experimentally measurable quantities ( @xmath0 , @xmath58 ) related to the vortex pinning by qp ( e.g. , the penrose lattice ) pinning arrays .",
    "in this section we study the pinning of vortices by one dimensional ( 1d ) qp chains of pinning sites .      as an example of a 1d qp chain , or 1d _ quasicrystal _ , a fibonacci sequence",
    "is considered , which can be constructed following a simple procedure : let us consider two line segments , long and short , denoted , respectively , by @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "if we place them one by one , we obtain an infinite periodic sequence : @xmath61 a unit cell of this sequence consists of two elements , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in order to obtain a qp sequence ,",
    "these elements are transformed according to fibonacci rules as follows : @xmath59 is replaced by @xmath62 , @xmath60 is replaced by @xmath59 : @xmath63 as a result , we obtain a new sequence : @xmath64    iteratively applying the rule ( [ rule ] ) to the sequence ( [ lsl ] ) , we obtain , in the next iteration , a sequence with a five - element unit cell @xmath65 , then with an eight - element unit cell @xmath66 , and so on , to infinity . for the sequence with an @xmath67-element cell , where @xmath68 , the ratio of numbers of long to short elements is the golden mean value , @xmath69 the position of the @xmath67th point where a new element , either @xmath59 or @xmath60 , begins is determined by @xcite : @xmath70 ,   x_{n } = n + \\gamma \\left [ \\gamma n \\right ] ,   \\label{qpcoor}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 $ ] denotes the maximum integer less or equal to @xmath72 equation ( [ qpcoor ] ) corresponds to the case when the fibonacci sequence has a ratio @xmath3 of the length of the short segment , @xmath4 , to the length of the long segment , @xmath5 .",
    "ratios @xmath7 other than @xmath73 correspond to other chains which are all qp . along with the golden mean value of @xmath74 , we use in our simulations @xmath7",
    "s varying in the interval between 0 and 1 : @xmath75 , when analyzing a continuous transition from a periodic to a qp ( fibonacci sequence ) pinning array .    to study the critical depinning current @xmath0 in 1d qp pinning chains , we place pinning sites on the points where @xmath59 or @xmath60 elements of the qp sequence link to each other .",
    "therefore , the coordinates of the centers of the pinning sites are defined by eq .",
    "( [ qpcoor ] ) with @xmath3 .",
    ", as a function of the applied magnetic flux @xmath1 , in a 1d periodic chain of pinning sites , for a cell containing 25 pinning sites , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the indicated fluxes @xmath10 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 correspond to the first , second , and third matching fields .",
    "the function @xmath2 is shown for two different values of the pinning site radius , @xmath80 ( a ) , and @xmath57 ( b ) .",
    "when @xmath41 , decreases , the main commensurability peaks become sharper , as shown in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    ", width=359 ]      we start with a periodic chain of pinning sites , which can be considered , in the framework of the above scheme , as a limiting case of a `` qp '' chain with @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath81 . in fig .  1a",
    ", the critical current @xmath82 is shown as a function of the applied magnetic flux @xmath1 for @xmath83 and for a pinning site radius @xmath84 .",
    "sharp peaks of the function @xmath2 correspond to matching fields .",
    "since the dimensionless critical current we plot is that per vortex and is proportional to the number of pinned vortices and inversely proportional to the total number of vortices ( eq  ( [ jc ] ) ) , therefore , the magnitude of the peaks versus @xmath85 decreases as @xmath86 .",
    "then the maximum heights of the peaks are : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "note that these values are obtained provided each pinning site can trap only one vortex , which is justified for the chosen radius of the pinning site and for the vortex densities considered .",
    "in addition , there are weak wide maxima corresponding to @xmath90 and other `` subharmonics '' , i.e. @xmath91 ( fig .",
    "1a ) , where @xmath18 is an integer .",
    "for very small values of @xmath10 , the vortex density is very low , and vortices almost do not interact with each other . as a result , in the ground state",
    "they all become trapped by pinning sites , and @xmath0 is maximal for small @xmath10 .    for smaller radii of the pinning sites , @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "1b ) , the @xmath2 peaks corresponding to matching fields become sharper because for smaller values of @xmath41 , it is more difficult to fulfill the commensurability conditions .",
    "any features around the main peaks , including subharmonics , are suppressed .",
    "note also a `` parity effect '' takes place in this case : since the number of pinning sites per cell is odd ( @xmath76 in fig .  1 )",
    ", therefore @xmath2 peaks are suppressed for @xmath90 and for _ even _ values of @xmath18 in the sequence @xmath91 .",
    "let us consider a qp chain of pinning sites with spacings between pinning sites given by @xmath5 ( long ) and @xmath4 ( short ) .",
    "the long and short segments alternate according to the fibonacci rules forming a fibonacci sequence .",
    "the number of pinning sites per cell coincides with the number of elements of this sequence per unit cell .",
    "it is natural to take a chain with a number of elements equal to one of the successive fibonacci numbers as a 1d cell , although in principle it could be of any length .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions at the ends of the cell .    the larger cell we take , the closer we are to describing a truly qp structure . however , it turns out , that even a finite part of a qp system ( 1d chain or 2d qp lattice ) provides us with reliable information concerning properties of the whole system .",
    "this is based on the structural _ self - similarity _ of qp systems .",
    "these properties are studied here for the critical depinning current @xmath0 and have also been demonstrated for other physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "figure  2 shows the evolution of @xmath0 as a function of the number of vortices , @xmath93 , for various values of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the top curve represents the limiting case of a periodic chain ( @xmath94 ) with typical peak structure discussed above ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the chain contains @xmath95 pinning sites . as a result",
    ", commensurability peaks appear at @xmath96 42 , 63 , etc . ,",
    "i.e. multiples of 21",
    ". a small qp distortion of the chain does not appreciably affect the peak structure of the function @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . when the deviation of the factor @xmath7 from unity becomes larger ( @xmath99 , 0.7 ) , commensurability peaks for @xmath100 63 , and other multiples of 21 decrease in magnitude .",
    "at the same time , new peaks appear at @xmath101 76 ( @xmath102 ) , 97 ( @xmath103 ) for @xmath99 .",
    "then , with further decrease of @xmath7 ( @xmath104 ) , these peaks remain ( @xmath105 even grows in magnitude ) , and a new peak at @xmath106 arises .    for the golden mean - related value of @xmath107 , we obtain a set of peaks , which are `` harmonics '' of the numbers of long and short periods of the chain ( or reciprocal lengths @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) , i.e. @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the numbers of long and short elements , respectively ; @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xmath114 are generally ( positive or negative ) multiples or divisors of @xmath109 and @xmath110 ; the upper index `` qp '' denotes `` quasiperiodic '' .",
    "it is easy to see that this set includes as a subset the sequence of successive fibonacci numbers .",
    "in particular , the following well - resolved peaks of the function @xmath97 appear for @xmath107 : @xmath115 ( @xmath116 , 13 is a fibonacci number ( fn ) ) ; @xmath117 ( @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a fn ) ; @xmath120 ( @xmath121 , 21 is a fn ) ; @xmath122 - 28 ( @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is a fn ) ; @xmath106 @xmath125 ; @xmath126 - 45 ( @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a fn ) ; @xmath105 ( @xmath129 , 55 is a fn ) ; @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) ; @xmath132 ( @xmath133 , 89 is a fn ) . in summary , the most pronounced peaks are at : @xmath134 17 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , which ( except the point @xmath135 ) form a sequence of successive fns .",
    "the above qp peaks only slightly degrade at @xmath136 . however ,",
    "when the length of the long segment @xmath5 becomes twice the length of the short one @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath137 , sharp commensurability peaks appear which are related to the small segment of the chain with length @xmath138 .",
    "namely , we obtain peaks at @xmath139 and at other values of @xmath25 which are sub - harmonics of @xmath140 : @xmath141 34 , 68 . other peaks , in particular , those related to the fibonacci sequence , are much less pronounced for @xmath137 . for @xmath142 ,",
    "the peaks are at : @xmath134 17 , 34 , 47 ( @xmath143 ) , 68 , and 81 . a very strong ( recall that the maximum amplitude of the peak is @xmath144 ) peak at @xmath145 is a `` resonance '' peak corresponding to the ratio of @xmath146 , i.e. @xmath147 .",
    "when @xmath148 , the `` resonance '' ratio @xmath149 , therefore , a strong peak appears for the `` nearest to 0.3 '' value @xmath150 @xmath151 , and also for @xmath152 .",
    "another `` close to 0.3 '' value is @xmath153 which is responsible for the peaks at @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) and @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "also , peaks at @xmath134 17 and 55 are present .",
    "the `` resonant '' peak for @xmath158 ( i.e. , for the ratio @xmath159 ) , appears at @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "the closest neighboring peaks are at @xmath156 ( @xmath162 ) and @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) , [ also : @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) ] , characterized by ratios @xmath167 and @xmath168 correspondingly .",
    "finally , for @xmath169 we arrive at the situation when we have an almost periodic chain but with a period @xmath170 different from that for @xmath94 : @xmath171 since @xmath172 the number of pinning sites becomes @xmath173 , and we obtain commensurability peaks at the positions which are multiples of @xmath174 , i.e. , at @xmath134 26 , 39 , 52 , which is typical for periodic chains of pinning sites .    in order to demonstrate that the above analysis is general and reveals the qp features independently of the length of a specific chain of pinning sites , let us compare results from the calculation of @xmath97 for different chains . in fig .",
    "3a , the function @xmath97 is shown for four different 1d qp chains , @xmath95 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 , and the same @xmath178 .",
    "figure  3a clearly shows that the _ positions _ of the _ main peaks in @xmath0 _ , i.e. those corresponding to a fibonacci sequence , and other peaks whose positions are described by eq .",
    "( [ xpeaks ] ) , to a significant extent , do _ not _ depend on the length of the chain .",
    "the peaks shown in fig .",
    "3 form a fibonacci sequence : @xmath134 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , 144 , and other `` harmonics '' : @xmath141 27 - 28 ( @xmath179 ) , 44 - 45 ( @xmath180 ) , etc . at the same time , longer chains allow to better reveal peaks for larger fibonacci numbers . thus , for chains with @xmath181 ( fig .",
    "3b ) peaks at the next fibonacci numbers are pronounced : @xmath182 233 , 377 .    while the curves for different chains are plotted in fig .",
    "3a in the same scale , fig .",
    "3c shows these curves in individual scales .",
    "namely , we rescale each @xmath0 by normalizing each @xmath0 by the number of pinning sites in each curve .",
    "thus , @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath120 for the chain with @xmath95 , to @xmath106 for the chain with @xmath175 , etc .",
    "after this rescaling , the @xmath0 curves approximately follow each other and have pronounced peaks for the golden - mean - related values of @xmath183 , as shown in fig .  3c .",
    "for example , @xmath184 corresponds to @xmath106 for the chain with @xmath95 , to @xmath105 for the chain with @xmath175 , to @xmath132 for @xmath176 , to @xmath185 for @xmath177 , and to @xmath186 for the chain with @xmath181 .",
    "note that these peaks ( i.e. , corresponding to the golden mean ) are most pronounced for each chain in fig .  3a , b .    therefore , the same peaks of the function @xmath2 for different chains are revealed before and after rescaling .",
    "this means that the function @xmath2 for the 1d qp chain is _ self - similar_. below , we demonstrate the revealed self - similarity effect in a reciprocal @xmath8-space .",
    "as we established above , the revealed qp features ( e.g. , peaks of the function @xmath187 ) ( i ) are independent of the length of the chain and ( ii ) the longer chain we take , the more details ( e.g. , `` subharmonics '' ) of qp features can be observed .",
    "this result is related to an important property of qp systems , self - similarity , which could be better understood by analyzing the fourier - transform of the distribution function of the system of vortices pinned on a qp array .    in @xmath8-space ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath188 of a system of @xmath53 pinned vortices can be represented as the inverse fourier - transform of the 1d distribution function @xmath189 of the vortices in real space : @xmath190     vortices pinned on a qp array , for @xmath74 .",

    ", each subsequent subdivision leads to a subset of peaks similar to the entire set of peaks .",
    "this analysis clearly demonstrates the self - similarity of the distribution function of the vortices pinned on a qp 1d array of pinning sites .",
    "similarly to the observed behavior of the function @xmath2 when increasing the length of the chain of pinning sites , the fourier - transform of the distribution function of the vortices pinned on a qp array reproduce its main features ( peaks ) in a self - similar way , when increasing the range in @xmath8-space , and simultaneously acquires a more elaborate structure with smaller self - similar peaks .",

    "in particular , we are interested whether any specific matching effects can exist in this system between the pinning lattice and the interacting vortices , which define the critical depinning current at different values of the applied magnetic field ( i.e. , the function @xmath2 ) .",
    "on the one hand , qp ( quasicrystalline ) patterns are intrinsically _ incommensurate _ with the flux lattice for _ any _ value of the magnetic field @xcite , therefore , in contrast to periodic ( e.g. , triangular or square ) pinning arrays , one might _ a priori _ assume a _ lack _ of sharp peaks in @xmath2 for qp arrays of pinning sites .    on the other hand , the existence of many periods in the penrose lattice can lead to a hierarchy of matching effects for certain values of the applied magnetic field , resulting in strikingly - broad shapes for @xmath2 .    in order to match the vortex lattice on an entire qp pinning array ,",
    "the specific geometry of the elements which form the qp lattice is important as well as their arrangement , as distinct from the flux quantization effects and superconductor - to - normal phase boundaries for which the areas of the elements only plays a role @xcite . as mentioned above ,",
    "a five - fold penrose lattice is constructed of building blocks , or rhombuses , of two kinds . while the sides of the rhombuses are equal ( denoted by @xmath170 ) , the distances between the nodes ( where we place pinning sites ) are _ not _ equal ( which is problematic for vortices ) .",
    "the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombuses are as follows ( fig .",
    "8b ) : @xmath224 ( the short diagonal of a thick rhombus ) ; @xmath225 , where @xmath229 is the golden mean ( the long diagonal of a thick rhombus ) ; @xmath226a = ( \\tau -1)a \\approx 0.618a$ ] , ( the short diagonal of a thin rhombus ) ; @xmath227 ( the short diagonal of a thin rhombus ) .    based on this hierarchy of distances",
    ", we can predict matching effects ( and corresponding features of the function @xmath2 ) for the penrose - lattice pinning array .",
    "first , we can expect that there is a `` first matching field '' ( let us denote the corresponding flux as @xmath10 ) when each pinning site is occupied by a vortex .",
    "although sides of all the rhombuses are equal to each other similarly to that in a periodic lattice , nevertheless this matching effect is not expected to be accompanied by a sharp peak .",
    "instead , it is a _ broad _ maximum since it involves _ three _ kinds of local `` commensurability '' effects of the flux lattice : with the rhombus side @xmath170 ; with the short diagonal of a thick rhombus , @xmath224 , which is close to @xmath170 ; and with the short diagonal of a thin rhombus , which is the golden mean times @xmath170 , @xmath230 ( see fig .",
    "it should be noted that this kind of matching assumes that a vortex lattice is rather _ weak _ , i.e. the effect can be more or less pronounced depending on the specific relations between the vortex - vortex interaction constant and the strength of the pinning sites as well as on the distance between pinning sites and their radius . assuming that the vortex - vortex interaction constant is a material parameter",
    ", all others can be adjustable parameters in experiments with artificially - created qp pinning arrays .",
    "for instance , the pinning parameters can be `` adjusted '' by using as pinning centers antidots , i.e. microholes of different radii `` drilled '' in a superconductor film @xcite , or blind antidots @xcite of different depths and radii .",
    "further , we can deduce that next to the above `` main '' matching flux there is another matching related with the filling of all the pinning sites in the vertices of thick rhombuses and only _ three out of four _ of the pinning sites in the vertices of thin rhombuses , i.e. , one of the pinning sites in the vertices of thin rhombuses is empty . for this value of the flux , which is lower than @xmath10 ,",
    "matching conditions are fulfilled for _ two _ close distances , @xmath170 ( the side of a rhombus ) and @xmath224 ( the short diagonal of a thick rhombus ) but are not fulfilled for the short diagonal , @xmath231 , of the thin rhombus .",
    "therefore , this qp feature is related to the golden mean value , although not in such a direct way as in the case of a 1d qp pinning array .",
    "this 2d qp matching results in a very wide maximum of the function @xmath2 .",
    "the position of this broad maximum , i.e. , the specific value of @xmath1 ( denoted here by @xmath232 ) could be found as follows . the ratio of the numbers of thick and thin rhombuses is determined by the fibonacci numbers and in the limit of large pinning arrays , @xmath233 this ratio tends to the golden mean .",
    "the number of unoccupied pinning sites is governed by the number of thin rhombuses .",
    "however , some of the thin rhombuses are separated from other thin rhombuses by thick ones ( call them _ single _ thin rhombuses ) , but some of them have common sides with each other ( _ double _ thin rhombuses ) .",
    "therefore , the number of vacancies ( i.e. , unoccupied pins ) is then the number of single thin rhombuses plus one _ half _ of the number of `` double '' thin rhombuses , @xmath234 where @xmath235 is the number of unoccupied pinning sites at @xmath236 , @xmath237 and @xmath238 are the numbers of single and double thin rhombuses , correspondingly .    for higher vortex densities ( e.g. , for @xmath239 ) , we can expect the appearance of a feature ( maximum ) of the function @xmath2 related to the entry of a single _ interstitial _ vortex into each _",
    "thick _ rhombus .",
    "the position of this maximum is determined by the number of vortices at @xmath208 , which is @xmath240 , plus the number of thick rhombuses , @xmath241 .",
    "since the ratio of the number of thick to that of thin rhombuses is the golden mean , @xmath205 ( in an infinite lattice ; in a finite lattice ,    it is determined by a ratio of two successive fibonacci numbers ) , then @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the total number of rhombuses .",
    "here we used : @xmath244    in fig .  9a , the function @xmath2 is plotted for an array of pinning sites in the form of a part of the penrose lattice , shown in figs .",

    "slightly _ `` quasiperiodically distorted '' triangular lattice ( see fig .",
    "the pinning sites of the triangular lattice are shifted from their `` correct '' positions but not randomly : their positions are determined by vortex - vortex interaction , which tries to restore the triangular lattice , and by the memory about previous configurations including the initial one , i.e. , the penrose lattice . analyzing the lattice presented in fig .",
    "7b we can deduce that it keeps some short - range order ( i.e. , distorted triangular cells similar in shape and size to those in the triangular lattice ) but does not have long - range order of the triangular lattice . as a result ,",
    "the main peak remains , since it is related to the short - order matching effects ( i.e. , over the distances of the order inter - site spacings @xmath170 ) .",
    "the sharp decrease around the maximum and appearance of the deep valleys is explained by the absence ( due to long - range order , i.e. , over distances longer than @xmath170 ) of any matching effects for the flux densities close to @xmath208 ( there is no matching for @xmath300 or @xmath301 and @xmath209 for the triangular lattice ) . when the long - range order is destroyed , as shown in fig .",
    "7b , matching effects other than @xmath208 become allowed .",
    "it is appropriate to mention here that the qp penrose lattice possesses a short - range order but does not have a long - range translational order .",
    "in such a way , the `` quasiperiodically distorted '' triangular lattice ( fig .",

    "notice that the qp lattice leads to a very broad and potentially useful _",
    "enhancement _ of the critical current @xmath2 , even compared to the triangular or random aps .",
    "the remarkably broad maximum in @xmath2 is due to the fact that the penrose lattice has _ many _",
    "( infinite , in the thermodynamic limit ) periodicities built in it @xcite . in principle",
    ", each one of these periods provides a peak in @xmath2 . in practice , like in quasicrystalline",
    "difraction patterns , only few peaks sre strong .",
    "this is also consistent with our study .",
    "furthermore , the pinning parameters can be adjusted by using as pinning centers either antidots ( microholes of different radii `` drilled '' in the film @xcite , or blind antidots @xcite of different depths and radii .",
    "thus , our results could be observed experimentally .",
    "the critical depinning current @xmath0 , as a function of the applied magnetic flux @xmath1 , has been studied in qp pinning arrays , from one - dimensional chains to two - dimensional arrays of pinning sites set in the nodes of quasiperiodic lattices including a 2d - quasiperiodic triangular lattice and a five - fold penrose lattice .    in a 1d quasiperiodic chain of pinning sites ,",
    "positions of the peaks of the function @xmath2 are governed by `` harmonics '' of long and short periods of the quasiperiodic chain . independently of the length of the chain , the peaks form a set of quasiperiodic sequence including a fibonacci sequence as a basic subset .",
    "analyzing the evolution of the peaks , when a continuous transition is performed from a periodic to a quasiperiodic lattice of the pinning sites , we found that the peaks related to the fibonacci sequence are most pronounced when the ratio of lengths of the long and the short periods is the golden mean .",
    "a comparison of the sets of peaks for different chains shows that the functions @xmath2 for the 1d quasiperiodic chain is self - similar . in the @xmath8-space",
    ", the self - similarity effect is displayed in the fourier - transform of the distribution function of the system of vortices pinned on a 1d quasiperiodic array of pinning centers .",
    "the evolution of quasiperiodic peaks when gradually changing the `` quasiperiodicity '' parameter @xmath7 ( i.e. , ratio of the lengths of short to long elements of a quasiperiodic chain ) has revealed a continuous transition from a periodic chain  through the set of quasiperiodic states  to another periodic chain with a longer period .",
    "this phenomena has been studied both in real space and in reciprocal @xmath8-space .    in 2d quasiperiodic pinning arrays ( e.g. , penrose lattice ) , the pinning of vortices is related to matching conditions between a triangular vortex lattice and the quasiperiodic lattice of the pinning centers .",
    "although more complicated than in 1d pinning chains , the specific behavior of @xmath2 is determined by the presence of two different kinds of elements  thick and thin rhombuses  forming the quasiperiodic lattice .",
    "based on these considerations , the positions of the main maxima of @xmath2 for penrose lattice are predicted .    in particular , for the first matching field",
    "each pinning site is occupied by a vortex .",
    "the corresponding maximum of the function @xmath2 is broad since it involves at least three kinds of local matching effects of the flux lattice , with the rhombus side and with short diagonals of thick and thin rhombuses .",
    "another penrose - lattice matching field is related with local matching effects which involve the intervortex distance of the vortex flux lattice , the rhombus side and the short diagonal of thick rhombus . for this field , all the pinning sites are occupied , which are situated in the vertices of thick rhombuses and only three out of four in the vertices of thin rhombuses .",
    "the number of unoccupied pinning sites is governed by the number of thin rhombuses .",
    "some of the thin rhombuses are single ( i.e. , separated from other thin rhombuses by thick ones ) , while some of them are double ( i.e. , have common sides with each other ) .",
    "therefore , the number of vacancies is the number of single thin rhombuses plus one half of the number of `` double '' thin rhombuses .",
    "one more important feature of the function @xmath2 occurs for higher vortex densities , when a single interstitial vortex enters each thick rhombus .",
    "numerical simulations performed for various sample sizes have revealed a good agreement with our predictions .",
    "the revealed features can be more or less pronounced depending on specific relations between the vortex - vortex interaction constant and the strength of the pinning sites , as well as on the distance between pinning sites and their radius .",
    "while the vortex - vortex interaction constant is a material parameter , all others can be adjustable parameters in experiments with artificially created quasiperiodic pinning arrays .",
    "this can be reached by using , for instance , antidots ( i.e. , microholes `` drilled '' in a superconductor film ) or blind antidots of different depths and radii as pinning centers .",
    "our calculations provide the necessary relations between these parameters for possible experimental realizations .",
    "a continuous deformation of the penrose lattice to a periodic triangular lattice ( i ) shows that the above revealed features are hallmarks of quasiperiodic pinning arrays ; ( ii ) provides us with a tool for the controlled change of the magnitude , sharpness and the position of the peaks of @xmath2 that is important for possible applications .",
    "in particular , our analysis shows that the quasiperiodic lattice provides an unusually broad critical current @xmath2 , that could be useful for practical applications demanding high @xmath0 s over a wide range of fields .",
