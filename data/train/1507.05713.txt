    "the fundamental differential relation  @xcite @xmath1 connects the thermodynamic state functions temperature @xmath2 , internal energy @xmath3 , and entropy  @xmath4 . given @xmath4 as a function of @xmath3 , and",
    "possibly other control parameters , eq .   in fact _ defines _ the thermodynamic temperature .",
    "the concept of entropy was introduced by rudolf clausius  @xcite in 1865 .",
    "clausius chose the symbol @xmath4 in honor of ( nicolas lonard ) sadi carnot , who laid the groundwork for the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the celebrated clausius relation @xmath5 identifies the inverse of the thermodynamic temperature @xmath2 as the integrating factor for the second law , with @xmath6 denoting quasi - static and reversible infinitesimal heat exchange .",
    "after clausius seminal paper  @xcite , it took about 30 more years until gibbs  @xcite , einstein , planck  @xcite and others  @xcite were able to connect firmly thermodynamics and statistical mechanics  and",
    "yet certain aspects of this connection have remained a subject of debate up to this day .",
    "the standard approach in statistical mechanics is to identify thermodynamic state functions with specific average values of a suitably chosen statistical ensemble that correctly reflects the physical conditions under which measurements are performed ( perfect isolation , coupling to an energy or matter reservoir , etc . ) .",
    "the most fundamental statistical ensemble is the microcanonical ensemble ( mce ) , describing the thermodynamics of isolated systems that are governed by energy conservation and which , at equilibrium , can not exchange heat or matter with their surroundings .",
    "the mce is the foundation of other thermostatistical ensembles , including the canonical ensemble ( which permits permanent energy and/or heat exchange with the environment ) and the grand - canonical ensemble ( which allows both energy and matter exchange ) .",
    "these two subordinate ensembles can be derived from the mce by considering a subsystem of interest that is _ weakly _ coupled to the rest of the globally isolated microcanonical system , which is then interpreted as an environment ( heat bath or particle reservoir ) for the particular subsystem .",
    "recent experimental advances make it possible to investigate thermodynamic properties of very small systems ( single molecules , brownian colloids or even individual atoms ) that may be , in good approximation , decoupled from the environment or that can be in weak or strong contact with a much larger system .",
    "such finite - system studies provide a valuable testbed for the notion and meaning of thermodynamic temperature in the context of various statistical ensembles .",
    "particularly interesting from a theoretical and practical perspective are situations in which different ensemble descriptions are not guaranteed to be equivalent .",
    "ensemble inequivalence is more norm than exception in finite - size systems but can also occur in macroscopic systems with long - range interactions or when the density of states ( dos ) is a nonmonotic function of energy .",
    "equilibrium systems of the latter type are often classified as anomalous  @xcite and , if entropy is chosen naively , they can give rise to the paradoxical notion of a negative absolute temperature .    in the remainder of this contribution , we will survey the meaning of temperature in thermodynamics by summarizing and commenting on results from recent more detailed studies  @xcite .",
    "the mce describes the thermostatistics of a strictly isolated system through the density operator @xmath7 , where the normalization constant @xmath8 is the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the mce is the most fundamental ensemble as it only relies on the conservation of energy @xmath3 , arising from the time - translation invariance of the underlying hamiltonian @xmath9 .",

    "this means that , without further manipulation or measurements ( or the introduction of a maxwell demon ) , the total entropy remains @xmath50 after separation , a fact that has been missed by authors  @xcite who recently criticized the gibbs entropy .",
    "unsurprisingly , this basic error led to paradoxical conclusions  @xcite , such as an apparent violation of mathematically exact inequalities .    for completeness",

    "* heat does not always flow from hot to cold .",

    "this means there exist situations where neither the gibbs temperature @xmath19 nor the boltzmann temperature @xmath58 can predict the energy flow between weakly coupled systems that had different temperatures before contact  @xcite .",
    "for instance , for a system with oscillatory dos , two or more significantly different energy values can have the same temperature , regardless of which entropy definition one adopts ( see fig .",

    "compared with infinite - systems thermodynamics , a practical difference is given by the fact that fluctuations generally play a ( much ) more important role in small systems .",
    "the presence of fluctuations , of course , does not mean that it is forbidden to characterize single dna molecules thermodynamically ; on the contrary , such fluctuations typically contain important additional thermodynamic and energetic information that is usually lost in the infinite - system limit .",

    "of eq .  , instead of discarding finite - system thermodynamics on purely habitual grounds  @xcite .",
    "dogmatic insistence on the thermodynamic limit @xmath76 is about as useful as insisting on the newtonian limit , corresponding to speed of light @xmath77 , in relativity . in both cases",
    ", things may become simpler , but one is missing out on relevant physics .",
    "* clausius relation & carnot efficiency .",
    "* campisi  @xcite showed recently that the inverse gibbs temperature @xmath78 appears naturally as the integrating factor in the clausius relation for virtually all practically relevant physical systems .",

    "moreover , the non - negativity of the gibbs temperature directly implies that carnot efficiencies can not exceed 1 .",
    "* thermodynamic potentials can be nonlocal .",
    "* it is sometimes argued that the gibbs entropy can not be the correct thermodynamic entropy as it is based on the integrated phase - space volume @xmath18 , which is a nonlocal  quantity that arises from a summation over states in an extended energy range .",

    "second , if we insisted on purely local potentials everywhere in physics then we would have to stop using force potentials in mechanics , which are in essence non - local integrals over local forces experienced by particles . at this point",
    ", however , it is helpful to recall why such non - local potentials are introduced in mechanics in the first place : they allow us to define an important conserved quantity , _ energy_. just as the energy is invariant under infinitesimal time translations , the integrated phase - space volume @xmath18 is invariant under infinitesimal adiabatic parameter translations  @xcite .",

    "* ising models are bad benchmarks . *",
    "when using specific theoretical models to illustrate alleged pros and cons of certain entropy definitions , then it is advisable to verify first that these models respect superordinate experimentally established knowledge .",
    "specifically , while the observed stability of matter implies the existence of lower energy bounds on hamiltonians , there exists no evidence to date for strict upper energy bounds .",
    "this means that @xmath79 is not a fundamental symmetry of physics and , hence , one should not impose such energy - reflection symmetry on thermodynamic quantities . for the same reason , it is not advisable to base arguments exclusively on ising - type models , which are _ ad hoc _ truncations of more fundamental hamiltonians that are _ not _ bounded from above , if one wants to evaluate the conceptual validity of a certain thermostatistical framework .",
    "* ensemble ( in)equivalence .",
    "* although @xmath80 and other entropy candidates @xcite often yield practically indistinguishable predictions for the thermodynamic properties of large _ normal _ systems @xcite , such as quasi - ideal gases with macroscopic particle numbers , they can produce substantially different predictions for finite mesoscopic systems , for ad - hoc truncated hamiltonians with upper energy bounds or even for macroscopic gravitational systems  @xcite .",
    "this implies ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : canonical ] below ) that , in general , microcanonical and canonical descriptions are not equivalent , which is not surprising as they refer to different physical conditions ( complete isolation _ vs. _ coupling to an infinite bath ) .",
    "the canonical boltzmann factor @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is commonly identified with the bath temperature , has become one of the most frequently employed statistical tools in physics .",
    "it is therefore conceptually important and practically useful to understand potential validity limits , which arise from assumptions and approximations made during the derivation from the underlying mce .",
    "we briefly summarize the key assumptions underlying the derivation of the boltzmann factor by considering a system of interest @xmath83 which is coupled to another system @xmath84 that acts as a heat bath .",
    "the starting point of the derivation is the microcanonical density operator @xmath85/ { \\omega^{\\mathcal{t}}}({e^{\\mathcal{t } } } , z)}$ ] of the total system @xmath86 .",
    "the first key assumption en route to the boltzmann factor is _ weak coupling _ , which means that one neglects system - bath interaction contributions to the total energy and hamiltonian , by writing  @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "because the total energy @xmath89 is fixed , the probability weight @xmath90 to find the fluctuating energy value @xmath91 of the subsystem @xmath83 is simply given by  @xcite @xmath92 here , @xmath93 denotes the degeneracy of the subsystem energy value @xmath91 , while @xmath94 is the dos of the bath at energy @xmath95 , and @xmath96 the total dos at the total energy @xmath89 .",

    "note that eq .",
    "is essentially an expansion in the energy fluctuations of the bath @xmath103 . inserting the expansion   into eq .   gives .",
    "for example , the coefficient in front of the quadratic term is proportional to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the canonical specific heat of the bath . for this term to vanish individually",
    ", @xmath106 has to be sufficiently large .",
    "roughly speaking , one can expect that the second - order as well as higher - order expansion terms become negligible if the boltzmann temperature @xmath107 changes only slowly when the bath energy is varied .",
    "this typically requires a large bath . ]",
    "@xmath108.\\ ] ] assuming  _ all _ higher - order terms can be neglected , one obtains the standard result @xmath109 .\\ ] ] where all remaining @xmath91-independent terms have been absorbed into the normalizing constant @xmath110 , which is the canonical partition function .",
    "thus , the temperature entering the celebrated boltzmann factor @xmath111 is the _ boltzmann temperature _ @xmath107 of the _",
    "bath_. one may therefore be tempted to assume that @xmath107 can be identified with the thermodynamic temperature of the total system . however , this is logically incorrect because @xmath112 is in general not equal  @xcite to the total system boltzmann temperature @xmath113 or gibbs temperature @xmath114 , with the latter being the actual thermodynamic temperature . of course ,",
    "when the bath is macroscopically large and normal ( e.g. , ideal gas - like ) from a thermostatistical viewpoint , then the effective temperature @xmath107 practically coincides with the gibbs temperatures of the bath @xmath84 , the system  @xmath83 , and the total system  @xmath115 , and we have @xmath116 in this limit . in contrast",
    ", when considering finite thermostats ( i.e. , a bath with a finite number of microstates ) , then the exponential boltzmann has to be replaced by a generalized boltzmann factor , which may assume the form of a tsallis - renyi escort distribution @xcite .      having surveyed the notion of temperature in the canonical ensemble , we still address another subtlety that concerns the heat capacities of nano - systems .",
    "when studying the thermodynamic properties of nano - scale devices , one naturally encounters the question whether the weak coupling approximation remains justified . indeed , for a typical nano - system in contact with a heat bath , the coupling energy is usually of the order of the average system energy .",
    "therefore , coupling terms in the hamiltonian can no longer be neglected .",
    "this issue was investigated in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , which focused on the question how the canonical heat capacity is affected when nano - subsystems are _ strongly _ coupled to a large normal bath .",
    "these studies showed that the reduced canonical weight ( or reduced density operator in quantum mechanics ) of a strongly coupled small system is no longer of the boltzmann form , when expressed in terms of the bare sub - system energy @xmath91 or corresponding hamilton operator @xmath117 .",
    "instead , the canonical weight now features a renormalized subsystem hamiltonian that depends explicitly on both effective bath temperature @xmath58 and coupling strength .",
    "moreover , as a main consequence , the canonical specific heat of the subsystem is not guaranteed to be positive and can , in fact , attain _ negative _ values even for @xmath118  @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic entropy of such a strongly coupled quantum system , obtained from its canonical partition function via the free energy , assumes a form that is close ( but not exactly equal ) to the quantum conditional entropy , and can become negative for @xmath118  @xcite .",
    "this does not affect , however , the validity of the third law as stated above , which holds true for @xmath119 even when a small quantum subsystem is strongly coupled to a heat bath ; see fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite for an example .",
    "we conclude our discussion of the canonical ensemble with brief remarks on thermodynamic and information - theoretic entropies . the exponential boltzmann distribution   is directly linked to the entropy @xmath120 , as already noted by gibbs  @xcite who discussed @xmath121 exclusively in the context of the canonical ensemble .",
    "nowadays , @xmath121 is commonly referred to as the _ canonical _ gibbs - shannon entropy in classical statistical mechanics and as the von neumann entropy in quantum statistics .",
    "it is well - known that the canonical distribution   can be obtained by maximizing @xmath121 under the assumption that the mean energy @xmath122 is given .",
    "however , such a purely formal derivation conceals the underlying physical assumptions that determine the range of validity of the boltzmann distribution  .",
    "also , entropy maximization arguments often leave the impression that there is a direct 1-to-1 correspondence between thermodynamics and information theory , which is somewhat misleading for a number of reasons : first , there exist many different information measures  @xcite and the shannon entropy is just one of them - although an admittedly very nice one .",
    "second , the shannon entropy can be used to quantify the information content of arbitrary probability measures that , in most cases , have no relation to the thermodynamic equilibrium distributions .",
    "third , the most fundamental equilibrium ensemble , the mce , has a thermodynamic entropy that does not belong to the class of shannon entropies .",
    "therefore , some reservation seems in order when attempts are made to identify information - theoretic measures generically with thermodynamic entropies and _ vice versa_. a similar note of caution applies when one tries to relate information - theoretic inequalities to thermodynamic inequalities that arise in the context of the second law or from thermodynamic stability considerations  @xcite .",
    "potential analogies between thermodynamics and information theory are interesting and deserve to be explored in great detail , but they should not necessarily be raised to the level of postulates , when they have been shown to be incomplete and may obscure physical insight .",
    "the above discussion implicitly assumed that all derivatives exist and are well behaved .",
    "this is typically the case for classical hamiltonian systems with the exception of critical points  @xcite , as also encountered in the pendulum example above  @xcite . for quantum systems ,",
    "the problem is generally more subtle since quantum - mechanical energy spectra can be partially or completely discrete , and are typically very sensitive to small perturbations that can break symmetry - related degeneracies .",
    "similar effects occur in classical approximations to quantum systems , as for example the classical ising model .",
    "whenever one faces a completely or partially discrete spectrum @xmath123 , the corresponding dos @xmath12 becomes formally singular and essentially reduces to a collection of @xmath124-function at those discrete energy values , @xmath125 . in this case , the construction of a differentiable dos requires some sort of smoothing procedure .",
    "this issue is closely related to the so - called weyl problem of finding asymptotic approximations for the eigenvalue distributions of hermitian operators in finite domains , by applying some suitable averaging procedure to obtain a continuous dos  @xcite . for canonical systems ,",
    "one typically uses such a smoothed dos of the underlying energy spectrum at high ambient temperatures .",
    "when the spectrum exhibits a discrete range , then one can define the integrated dos @xmath23 , which enters the microcanonical gibbs entropy @xmath20 , in at least two different ways : the most commonly used method simply integrates the discrete dos @xmath12 over @xmath3 , which results in a step function @xmath126 that gives rise to singular thermodynamic derivatives .",
    "this approach seems unsatisfactory mathematically , for one simply integrates over the forbidden part .",
    "] of the spectrum while completely ignoring structural information encoded in the amplitude values @xmath127 of @xmath8 in the interpolation regions @xmath128 .",
    "a potentially better method  @xcite is based on analytic interpolation of the discrete level counting function  , where @xmath129 is the eigenspace of @xmath130 .",
    "although the most natural interpolations appear obvious when @xmath131 can be written as @xmath132 for some known function @xmath133  ( see examples in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , there remain open questions as to how to treat rigorously cases where no such closed - form representation is known .",
    "gibbsian thermodynamics  @xcite works consistently for finite and infinite systems , because the underlying mathematical and statistical foundations , most importantly liouville s theorem , merely rely on generic conservation laws that arise from the hamiltonian structure of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "working with infinite systems is generally easier as this limit often ( but not always ) forgives a certain laxness in defining entropy and thermostatistical observables , since different definitions may show the same asymptotic behavior when the particle number @xmath75 is let to @xmath134 . as mentioned before , this is quite analogous to the fact that the newtonian limit @xmath135 is generally easier to handle than a full relativistic treatment at finite speed of light  @xmath136 , which of course does not mean that newtonian dynamics is more correct than relativity .",
    "just as relativity compels us to think more carefully about how to formulate fundamental physical laws , the thermostatistical analysis of finite systems forces us to pay more rigorous attention to mathematical and physical consistency criteria  @xcite in thermodynamics .",
    "this profound insight can be attributed to gibbs , who wrote on page 179 of his fundamental treatise  @xcite : it would seem that in general averages are the most important , and that they lend themselves better to analytical transformations .",
    "this consideration would give preference to the system of variables in which @xmath137 [ @xmath138 in our notation ] is the analogue of entropy .",
    "moreover , if we make @xmath139 [ @xmath140 in our notation ] the analogue of entropy , we are embarrassed by the necessity of making numerous exceptions for systems of one or two degrees of freedoms .",
    "gibbs was , of course , well aware that statistical fluctuations become important in finite systems and that , therefore , the exact thermodynamic mean value relations   and   have to be complemented by detailed fluctuation analysis , as nowadays the norm in dna and colloid experiments  @xcite .    in this contribution , we have surveyed the notion of thermodynamic temperature in the microcanonical and the canonical ensemble . for isolated microcanonical systems , the gibbs volume entropy fulfills exactly the standard laws of thermodynamics as well as equipartion for a wide range of systems , including all classical standard hamiltonian systems regardless of their size . for finite systems ,",
    "fluctuation analysis provides important physical information beyond the mean values that define standard thermodynamic state - variables .",
    "the microcanonical gibbs formalism agrees with the clausius relation  @xcite , implies strictly non - negative temperatures and , hence , ensures carnot efficiencies @xmath141 .",
    "by contrast , the boltzmann entropy , which can yield negative absolute temperatures , is not a consistent thermodynamic entropy if one adopts the standard laws of thermodynamics , as summarized in eqs .",
    ". it is therefore not obvious to us why one should favor an entropy that can violate planck s law   over one that fulfills it rigorously .    notwithstanding",
    ", the boltzmann temperature plays an important role as an effective bath temperature in the canonical ensemble , describing a subsystem that is in weak contact with a quasi - infinite environment .",
    "if the bath behaves normally ( e.g. , ideal gas - like ) , then the boltzmann temperature practically coincides with the gibbs temperature .",
    "subtle differences arise , however , for systems that are non - weakly coupled to an environment , as typically the case for nano - scale devices . in the presence of strong coupling",
    ", the specific heat of the device can become negative @xcite even though the total system consisting of device and bath is thermodynamically stable .",
    "this feature is in stark contrast to the weak - coupling case , where the canonical specific heat of the subsystem is strictly positive .",
    "last and least , some authors  @xcite have recently criticized the microcanonical gibbs formalism  @xcite by limiting their discussion to infinite systems and advocating modified versions of the thermodynamic laws , tailored to favor their own preferred entropy definitions .",
    "if one accepts such reasoning , then one must also be willing to replace the exact eqs .   with inexact approximations  which seems a steep price to pay .",
    "the exactness of eqs .",
    " is not a consequence of specific postulates but follows from basic integral and differential calculus ( the proofs are trivial and take only a few lines  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , even if one dislikes the gibbs formalism as developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , one should at least acknowledge the correctness of the mathematically rigorous results  . moreover , instead of focusing on the discussion of abstract postulates  @xcite , it may also be useful to remind ourselves that the purpose of any thermodynamic theory should be the prediction of physically measurable quantities , such as pressure , magnetization , etc . which correspond to",
    "operationally well - defined statistical averages .",
    "we would therefore encourage readers who care about the practical applicability of theoretical concepts to perform the following simple numerical experiment :    1 .",

    "4 .   compare @xmath151 and @xmath150 with predictions from the various entropy definitions for any combination @xmath152 , starting with @xmath153 .",
    "if one still intends to discard the gibbs entropy afterwards , then one will have to explain why it is common sense to replace an entropy definition that produces correct predictions for all combinations @xmath152 by another one that does not .",
