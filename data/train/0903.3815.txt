    "wide - angle tail ( wat ) are a subset of radio galaxies near the fanaroff - riley ( 1974 ) luminosity transition , which have been extensively discussed because of their exclusive association with cluster dominant ( cd ) galaxies and also because of the abrupt flaring of their jets after maintaining a well collimated flow to distances @xmath3 kpc from the core ( e.g. owen & rudnick 1976 , odonoghue et al .",
    "1993 ) the jet disruption is sudden unlike fr i jets and the resulting plumes are often sharply bent . on the other side , although the jets are collimated like fr ii galaxies , they do not terminate in hot spots . search for explanations of",
    "the wat phenomenon began in the 1980s ( e.g. burns 1981 ; eilek et al .",
    "1984 ; leahy 1984 ; odea & owen 1985 ; odonoghue et al .",
    "since neither the bending of the radio plumes occurs universally , nor is the bending of jet essential for its flaring and plume formation , jet bending is currently regarded as a phenomenon independent from jet flaring ( hardcastle & sakelliou 2004 ; hardcastle , sakelliou & worrall 2005 ) .    since the host galaxies of wats are the dominant members of their group / cluster and hence located close to the bottom of the gravitational potential well , they are not expected to have a large motion relative to the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "this situation is not conducive to large ram pressure that could bend the jet / plume leading to the wat morphology .",
    "an alternative mechanism , based on numerical simulations has been investigated by loken et al.(1995 ) , hooda & wiita ( 1996 ) and burns et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in this picture , the sudden disruption of the jet and bending of its plume can arise , if upon crossing a sharp transition between the interstellar medium ( ism ) of its host galaxy and the icm , the jet encounters a transonic crosswind of the icm resulting from cluster merger ( an analytical treatment of the jet propagation through an ism / icm interface can be found in gopal - krishna & wiita 1987 ) . another alternate mechanism proposed in loken et al .",
    "( 1995 ) invokes a jet crossing an oblique shock formed due to colliding clumps in the cluster .",
    "strong support for the merging cluster scenario comes from the detection of x - ray elongations which trace the merger axis and are found to be in the direction of the wat radio tails ( gomez et al . 1997 ) and perpendicular to the initial jet direction ( burns et al .",
    "another mechanism , by higgins , obrian & dunlop ( 1999 ) , associates the jet flaring with its encounter with a discrete clump in the icm . while all these mechanisms seem plausible , it is intriguing that the deep chandra imaging , which is available for the best known wat , namely 3c 465 ( hardcastle et al .",
    "2005 ) , has failed to reveal any discontinuity in the external medium at the locations where the jets flare . moreover , for this same wat , jetha et al .",
    "( 2006 ) & hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have argued that , if the jet / plume is extremely light relative to the external medium , the speed of the host galaxy required for jet bending is only @xmath4 kms@xmath5 , which is not implausibly high even for the central galaxies of rich clusters ( much higher speeds can occur for galaxies in merging clusters ) .",
    "thus , the bending of the jet / plume in wats can possibly be explained .",
    "the circumstance of jet termination in wats has been investigated in several studies .",
    "hardcastle & sakelliou ( 2004 ) have shown that the distance between the host galaxy and the base of the plume inversely correlate with the cluster richness as quantified in terms of the temperature of the icm ( also , jetha et al .",
    "since wats reside at or close to gravitational centres of clusters and groups of galaxies , these can also be used as a signpost for the cluster or group of galaxies . indeed , blanton et al .",

    "the radio source was noticed by us while imaging the radio continuum of the low surface brightness galaxy ugc 6614 .",

    ", we discuss the nature of this radio source and its optical / x - ray environment .",
    "a hubble constant of 70 kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 is assumed .",
    "pgc 1519010 is located @xmath6 to the south of ugc 6614 , the giant low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy that was the principal target of our observations as part of our larger programme of observing the radio - band agn activity in giant low surface brightness galaxies ( see das et al . 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "we noticed that pgc 1519010 is catalogued by oneil et al .",

    "the catalogue contains all those galaxies in the region of the cancer and pegasus clusters whose central surface brightness @xmath7 mag - arcsec@xmath8 ( oneil et al .",
    "curiously , oneil et al . found that u1 - 3 has a central surface brightness of @xmath9 mag - arcsec@xmath8 and that its radial brightness distribution is better fit by the king s model ( 1962 , 1966 ) , rather than the exponential profile characteristic of lsb ( disk ) galaxies . since king s model is known to describe the surface brightness distribution of globular clusters in our galaxy , oneil et al .",
    "had in fact suggested that u1 - 3 ( pgc 1519010 ) might be a lsb globular cluster .",
    "a closer inspection of the sdss image , however , showed that it is an elliptical galaxy , most probably a cd with a large halo extending in the north - south ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "such a core - halo distribution of stars can be explained in terms of tidal distortion of an elliptical ( with a typical de vaucouleurs r@xmath10 brightness profile ) by its repeated gravitational encounters with other galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy 1997 ) , a highly plausible scenario for central regions of clusters and groups of galaxies .",
    "thus , we point out that the galaxy pgc 1519010 classified by oneil et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , using the sdss have identified a cluster ( nsc 113924 + 165506 ) centred @xmath23 north - east of pgc 1519010 ( see fig.[fig3 ] , the square symbol ) and having a photometric redshift of 0.1365 , which is close to the value estimated for the wat . to probe this further",

    "[ fig7 ] the distribution of the galaxies listed in sdss dr6 . for the cd progenitor of the wat , sdss j113920.37 + 165206",

    "al . 2003 ) .",
    "in order to trace the optical field near this region we searched the sdss for galaxies in the adjacent area and found three galaxies within @xmath27 of the cd galaxy pgc 1519010 ( wat ) , having spectroscopic redshifts between 0.105 and 0.107 . these include u1 - 8 ( u1 - 8 , oneil et al .",
    "1997 ) , a lsb galaxy lying about @xmath28 south of the cd , for which bergmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have estimated a spectroscopic redshift of 0.10715 ( photometric redshifts given in the sdss catalogue are 0.141 , 0.095 and 0.091 ) . the second galaxy , sdss j113921.25 + 165512.8 is close to u1 - 8 and sdss database gives a spectroscopic redshift of 0.105 whereas the photometric redshifts listed there are 0.121 , 0.118 and 0.108 .",
    "the third galaxy lies about @xmath29 north of the cd and sdss gives a spectroscopic redshift of 0.105 whereas the photometric redshifts are quoted there to be 0.061 , 0.094 and 0.0.095 .",
    "all these spectroscopic redshift strongly suggest that the true redshift of the cd ( wat ) is close to 0.106 , which would also be in reasonable accord with its photometric redshifts mentioned above .",
    "taking @xmath30 = 0.106 for the cd , the radio luminosities of the wat are @xmath31 watt - hz@xmath5-sr@xmath5 at 240 mhz and @xmath32 watt - hz@xmath5-sr@xmath5 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "these values lie in the region of the fr i / ii transition and are thus characteristic of wats .",
    "the distances from the core at which the jet flaring occurs are about 90 kpc and 230 kpc , for the eastern and western jets , respectively .",
    "to probe the large scale environment around the cd , we examined the sdss dr6 data over a @xmath33 circular region centred at the cd .",
    "in particular , we searched for the galaxies for which a physical association with the cd is very probable .",
    "the criterion we employed was that the photometric redshifts of the optical objects should be between 0.08 and 0.41 .",
    "a relatively wide range had to be admitted since the spectroscopic redshifts are available for only a few galaxies in the region .",
    "we found that the range roughly represents the typical scatter among the three sdss estimates of the photometric redshifts for the objects in this region .",
    "the 37 objects that we selected from the above criterion include only five galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "nonetheless , they can be expected to manifest the gross features of the galaxy clustering associated with the the cd ( wat ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "note also that in the soft x - ray band the @xmath2 ( voges et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) database shows a diffuse source of about @xmath34 diameter , covering this region .",
    "the detection of hot gas is consistent with the proposed galaxy clustering scenario .",
    "as mentioned above , gal et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have reported a galaxy cluster with abell richness 0 which is close in both redshift and direction to the galaxy group we identify here to be associated with the wat .      perhaps the most remarkable feature emerging from the galaxy distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) is a nearly 0.5 mpc long chain of galaxies stretching from the cd roughly north - south towards the cluster centre defined by gal et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and possibly extending also to the south of the cd .",
    "it is along this filament that galaxies are likely to have approached the cd prior to merging with it .",
    "this galaxy merger scenario is further supported by the shape of the stellar halo of the cd which too is extended roughly north - south .",
    "thus it appears plausible that a bulk motion of the intergalactic gas has been occuring along this galaxy filament .",
    "this circumstance may provide potentially interesting clues about the mechanism of the jet disruption and the jet / plume bending in this wat .",
    "following upon the early attempts to understand the nature of wats ( e.g. , eilek et al .",
    "1984 , leahy 1984 , odea & owen 1985 ) , a number of physical scenarios have been put forward to explain this rare type of phenomenon ( sect .",
    "1 ) . in some of the models ,",
    "the jet disruption occurs as the jet crosses the ism of the host galaxy into the icm , and is thereby subject to either a steep density gradient ( sakelliou & merrifield 1999 ) , or a side - way ram pressure ( `` crosswind '' arising from bulk motion of the icm , see loken et al .",
    "1995 ) . in another scenario , the plumes form as the radio lobes of moderately powerful twin - jets are driven outwards due to buoyancy forces ( hardcastle 1999 ) .",
    "the latter model is motivated by the observations that the jet in some wats continue well into the plume ( e.g. , hardcastle 1999 ; hardcastle & sakelliou 2004 ) .    despite the modest sensitivity of our radio maps ,",
    "the present wat offers some insight and a broad check on some of the proposed models .",
    "this is because of the morphological contrast observed between its two jet / plume structures , eventhough the kinetic powers of the two jets are expected to be similar .",
    "firstly , in this wat a correlation is clearly seen between the bending properties of the jet and the resulting plume . as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and [ fig4 ] , the western jet must be propagating straight for about 230 kpc before flaring and the resulting radio plume likewise shows no sign of bending .",
    "a contrasting pattern is seen on the eastern side of the core , where the collimated jet undergoes a steady bending until its disruption and thereafter the resulting plume too exhibits a sharp bend consistent with the bent trajectory of the eastern jet . from this correlated behaviour",
    "it appears that a viable mechanism for jet disruption in wats should be able to bend both the plume and the associated jet .",
    "this requirement casts some doubt on the mechanism which seeks to explain the jet disruption in terms of collision with a dense gas cloud ( sect .",
    "1 ) . indeed",
    ", the observed alignment of the bent eastern plume with the chain of galaxies ( see fig . [ fig7 ] ) would seem to be basically consistent with the ram pressure scenario involving bulk relative motion between the icm and the radio galaxy .",
    "the observed radio structure would also imply that the crosswind is in the ne - sw direction with the plume finally aligning with it ( see fig . [",
    "however , were the ram pressure of the icm crosswind effective only after the jet crosses the ism / icm interface , it would be hard to explain the steady bending of the preceding collimated portion of the jet .",
    "we may recall that a similar difficulty for the basic crosswind scenario ( e.g. , loken et al .",
    "1995 ) has been noticed in the case of the wat 0647 + 693 where the 50 kpc long collimated western jet exhibits a steady bending before its disruption ( hardcastle & sakelliou 2004 ) .",
    "it appears , therefore , that the effect of the icm crosswind moving along the galaxy filament which may eventually cause the sharp bending of the plume and its alignment along the filament also acts on the progenitor jet before its flaring .",
    "in fact , for the head - tail radio galaxy ngc 1265 , jones & owen ( 1979 ) have proposed that a pressure gradient set up in the ism due to the motion of the galaxy against icm can bend its jet within the ism , provided their mach number is not too large .",
    "but , even if such a mechanism is viable for the present case , it will be required to explain the near absence of bending of the western jet and its radio plume ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a & [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it would seem ad hoc to explain the contrasting pattern on the two sides by postulating a much larger kinetic power for the western jet",
    ". a conceivable alternative would be to postulate the existence of inhomogeneities in the icm on 100 kpc scale , but here too the inhomogeneity will have to be positioned , so as to operate on just one side of the nucleus .",
    "nonetheless , this possibility needs to be investigated further . as a first step",
    ", it would be useful to make a deeper radio image of this wat , in order to look for any bent faint extensions of the western plume and to trace the trajectories of the two jets more clearly .",
    "secondly , this object is an excellent target for multi - object spectroscopy needed for a better delineation of the galaxy distribution around the cd .",
    "finally , targeted x - ray imaging of this region is needed to establish the morphological details of the @xmath2 detected diffuse x - ray source , so that the suspected filamentary gravitational potential well can be properly traced .",
    "in this paper , we report the gmrt detection of a new wide - angle - tail radio source associated pgc 1519010 which we find to be a cd galaxy .",
    "these observations at 610 and 240 mhz were originally aimed at studying the low surface brightness galaxy located 16 to the north .",
    "the power of the radio source at 240 mhz is @xmath35 watt - hz@xmath5-sr@xmath5 which is close to the fri / frii break . using the sdss dr6 database ,",
    "we have identified a cluster of 37 galaxies likely to be associated with the wat .",
    "further the rosat all sky survey shows faint diffuse extended x - ray emission in the same region which indicates the presence of a hot intracluster medium . using the spectroscopic redshifts available for a few galaxies close to the cd",
    ", we suggest that the redshift of the group / cluster of galaxies associated with the wat is 0.106 .",
    "moreover , we note that the clustering of member galaxies close to the wat indicates a filament along which galaxies have been merging with the cd",
    ". this scenario also finds support in the observed ns extension of the stellar halo of the cd galaxy .",
    "our radio observations have highlighted the peculiar morphology of this wat radio source .",
    "the source shows constrasting morphology on the two sides of the core : the eastern jet emerges from the core and undergoes a gradual bending before being disrupted to form the plume which itself continues to bend in the same direction . on the western side ,",
    "the jet emerging from the core appears to continue straight for about 230 kpc , before being disrupted to form the faint plume which too shows no bent extension .",
    "the very different behaviour on the two sides suggests that the mechanism responsible for the plume bending is also causing the jet to bend .",
    "several mechanisms for jet bending have been put forward and separate mechanisms have also been invoked to explain the jet and plume bending ( sect .",
    "however , from our present results for the wat associated with pgc 1519010 , the similar bending shown by the jet and the plume on the east of the core suggests that the same bending mechanism is operating on both components .",
    "several theories have tried to explain the wat radio morphology . from our data , we favour the crosswind mechanism ( loken et al .",
    "1995 ) wherein the jet runs into the crosswind due to the merging of clusters and which , in turn , exerts ram pressure on the jet / plume , causing it to bend .",
    "we note that the eastern jet continues for about 90 kpc before being disrupted into a plume . around this distance",
    ", the jet would have crossed the hot ism of the host elliptical galaxy . and would encounter the lower density icm , causing it to flare .",
    "the direction of the bending of the jet / plume agrees with the filament of galaxies and the extension of the cd stellar halo .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission too is extended roughly in the ns direction , lending further support to the crosswind mechanism .",
    "however , explaining the unaffected / unbent western jet / plume is difficult unless inhomogeneities in the icm are invoked .",
    "more sensitive and high angular resolution observations are thus required to obtain a better understanding of this interesting system .",
    "we also report the detection of an ultra - steep spectrum source ( @xmath19 ) to the south of the eastern plume , which does not have an optical counterpart in sdss .",
    "another interesting source we have found is a highly asymmetric radio double source located to the west of the wat .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt who have made these observations possible .",

    "<S> we report the serendipitous detection of a wide - angle - tail ( wat ) radio galaxy at 240 and 610 mhz , using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . </S>",
    "<S> this wat is hosted by a cd galaxy pgc 1519010 whose photometric redshift given in the sdss dr6 catalog is close to the spectroscopic redshifts ( 0.105 , 0.106 and 0.107 ) of three galaxies found within @xmath0 of the cd . </S>",
    "<S> using the sdss dr6 we have identified a total of 37 galaxies within @xmath1 of the cd , whose photometric redshifts are between 0.08 and 0.14 . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that the cd is associated with a group of galaxies whose conspicuous feature is a north - south chain of galaxies ( filament ) extending to at least 2.6 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 all - sky survey shows a faint , diffuse x - ray source in this direction , which probably marks the hot intra - cluster gas in the potential well of this group .    </S>",
    "<S> we combine the radio structural information for this wat with the galaxy clustering in that region to check its overall consistency with the models of wat formation . </S>",
    "<S> the bending of the jet before and after its disruption forming the radio plume , are found to be correlated in this wat , as seen from the contrasting morphological patterns on the two sides of the core . </S>",
    "<S> probable constraints imposed by this on the models of wat formation are pointed out . </S>",
    "<S> we also briefly report on the other interesting radio sources found in the proximity of the wat . </S>",
    "<S> these include a highly asymmetric double radio source and an ultra - steep spectrum radio source for which no optical counterpart is detected in the sdss .    </S>",
    "<S> radio galaxies : cluster of galaxies : ram pressure : intracluster medium </S>"
