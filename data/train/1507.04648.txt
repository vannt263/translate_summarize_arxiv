    "swirling flows are ubiquitous in many industrial applications including furnaces , cyclone separators , heat exchangers , and turbines .",
    "yet , efficient numerical prediction with reynolds - averaged navier  stokes ( rans ) approximations is challenging and large - eddy simulations ( les ) are still prohibitively expensive for practical applications .",
    "for strongly rotating flows , various standard assumptions used in rans turbulence closures are not expected to hold , as discussed , for example , by jakirli et al .",
    "consequently , the performance of conventional rans modeling approaches for predicting swirling flow remains elusive and requires further verification and validation with experiments .",
    "kitoh  @xcite performed experiments with turbulent swirling flow in a straight pipe where the swirl component is generated through guide vanes with variable vane angle and a bell - shaped cone at the center of the swirl generator . based on the characteristic tangential velocity distribution , kitoh  @xcite categorized the flow field into three regions : wall , annular , and core . due to the streamline curvature ,",
    "skewed shear directions in the annular region , and the resulting anisotropy , kitoh  @xcite concludes that reynolds stress models seem more promising than eddy - viscosity models in providing accurate predictions of swirling flows .",
    "this conclusion confirms earlier simulation results of kobayashi and yoda  @xcite and is also supported by subsequent numerical studies .",
    "for example , simulations of hirai et al .",
    "@xcite show a better performance of reynolds stress models over the standard @xmath0-@xmath1 model and a modified @xmath0-@xmath1 model for the prediction of the laminarization phenomenon in swirling pipe - flow .",
    "similarly , oi et al .",
    "@xcite report that two - equation turbulence models including rng  @xmath0-@xmath1 , lauder sharma @xmath0-@xmath1 , and @xmath0-@xmath2  sst fail to predict experimental data , whereas the launder ",
    "gibson reynolds stress model and the speziale ",
    "gatski model are found to provide better agreement with experiments .",
    "in contrast , chen et al .",
    "@xcite find that the differential reynolds stress model proposed by launder et al .",
    "@xcite provides quantitatively inaccurate results for predicting tangentially injected swirling pipe flows , reaching only qualitative agreement with experimental results .",
    "further , several workers successfully applied turbulence models of the @xmath0-@xmath1 family to model swirling flow .",
    "for example , parchen and steenbergen  @xcite studied turbulent swirling pipe - flows for gas - metering applications and reported an acceptable behavior of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , which provided a better approximation of the experimental values compared to an algebraic slip model .",
    "escue and cui  @xcite found a superior performance of the rng  @xmath0-@xmath1 model over a reynolds stress model for moderate swirl intensities in 2d simulations when compared to experimental results .",
    "petit et al .",
    "@xcite successfully applied a @xmath0-@xmath1 model for unsteady simulations of a swirl generator , achieving good agreement in averaged velocity profiles .",
    "in view of the available results , a general consensus regarding the performance of eddy - viscosity closures for swirling flows appears to be lacking .      in this article , we study the swirling flow generated by a standardized clockwise swirl disturbance generator that is used for testing commercial flow meters ( figure  [ fig : swirlgrid ] ( a ) ) .",
    "commercial water , heat and cooling meters may be exposed to disturbed inflows when they are in operation , since the space available in realistic installations is often limited and prohibits the installation of a straight pipe long enough to create fully developed flow conditions upstream of the meter .",
    "common flow disturbances induced by several standard installations such as bent pipes or valves may compromise the accuracy of meter readings .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to assess the robustness of new products with respect to disturbed flow conditions .",
    "the standards en  iso  4064 - 2:2014  @xcite and oiml  r  49 - 2:2013  @xcite for the type - approval of commercial water meters and en  1434 - 4:2007  @xcite for the type - approval of commercial heat and cooling meters include standardized tests with artificially generated disturbed flows that are meant to emulate disturbed flow conditions in realistic installations .",
    "one of these artificially disturbed flows is generated by a standardized clockwise swirl disturbance generator ( figure  [ fig : swirlgrid ] ( a ) ) , which emulates the flow structures induced by a double - bent pipe installation .",
    "( for a study of flow structures induced by double - bent pipes see , for example , mattingly and yeh  @xcite . )",
    "a detailed analysis of flow patterns generated by such swirl disturbance generators is not part of the standard type - approval procedure , but it is a key factor in enabling a meaningful interpretation of type - approval tests .",
    "further , the detailed analysis of swirling flows has potential to assist the development process of robust meter designs and the associated testing and verification facilities . the swirling flow field generated with equipment according to en  iso  4064 - 2:2014  @xcite and oiml  r  49 - 2:2013  @xcite",
    "is expected to exhibit similar features as the flow fields in the studies discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "for example , eichler and lederer  @xcite conducted stereoscopic particle image velocimetry ( spiv ) measurements downstream of a standardized dn80 swirl disturbance generator , showing that the swirling flow is maintained up to @xmath3 downstream .",
    "similarly , tawackolian  @xcite provides experimental and numerical results using the @xmath0-@xmath2 model for a dn80 swirl generator and a comparison of the flow patterns produced by the swirl generator against those after bent pipes .",
    "while these studies provide valuable insight for large pipe diameters , no results appear to be available for smaller pipe diameters .",
    "since the standardized parts for different diameters according to en  iso  4064 - 2:2014  @xcite and oiml  r  49 - 2:2013  @xcite are not exactly self - similar , the scalability of available results to smaller diameters remains unclear .",
    "the present work aims to asses the potential of rans simulations in providing accurate predictions of the flow patterns downstream of a standardized swirl disturbance generator .",
    "in view of the discussion in section  [ sec : intro ] , available practical guidance for choosing turbulence models is ambiguous . to elucidate modeling choices for swirling pipe - flow , we study different numerical setups and compare them against experimental results obtained from laser - doppler velocimetry ( ldv ) experiments .",
    "our choice of turbulence models includes some of the most popular mainstream models currently used in industry .",
    "the aim is to identify best practices to achieve realistic and useful simulation results that can be used in practical applications such as flow meter testing and development .",
    "additionally , we discuss our results in the context of available recommendations regarding the modeling of swirling flows . within the study of different turbulence models , we also provide a detailed assessment of the impact of the mesh size and the length of the computational domain .",

    "the measurement grid comprises 241 measurement points as shown in figure  [ fig : swirlgrid ]  ( b ) .",
