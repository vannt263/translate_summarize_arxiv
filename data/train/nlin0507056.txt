    "the weight function @xmath142 is defined by the derivative  @xmath143 from  [ e18 - 4.4 ] as  @xmath144 .",
    "so , we have the system : @xmath145    the equations [ e18 - 4.7 ] has the integral @xmath146 this integral implies that there is no secular change of the energy of the unperturbed system [ e18 - 4.3 ] to this approximation ( laplace s theorem ) .",
    "the phase portrait of [ e18 - 4.7 ] on the surface of the integral [ stars0 ] depends on the parameter  @xmath147 .",

    "the parameter @xmath149 describes the ratio of the velocity of the attracting center to the characteristic velocity of the particle along the keplerian orbit .",
    "the equation [ e18 - 4.7 ] implies that the curvature sign determines the direction of the motion along the trajectory but not the shape of the trajectory .",
    "the value of curvature defines the velocity of motion along the trajectory .",
    "it is clear from the figures that the velocity of perihelion shift depends not only on the eccentricity of the orbit but also on the orientation of the orbit with respect to the direction of motion of the attracting center .    if  @xmath149 is small , there exist two stable periodic orbits with the non - zero eccentricity .",

    "the direction of the point mass motion along one of the orbit coincides with the direction of the attracting center s motion  @xmath150 .",
    "when the particle moves along another orbit  @xmath151 at the pericenter , its direction is opposite to the direction of the attracting center s motion .",

    "here , we can see small oscillations ( for the variables  @xmath110 , @xmath115 ) near the trajectories of the averaged system ( see  fig .",
    "remind that standard explanation of the perihelion shift is based on the schwarzschield solution ( eddington 1963 ) and implies that the shift velocity does not depend on the orientation of the orbit @xmath110 .",
    "this is not the case in our problem statement .",
    "there always exist orbits such that only their eccentricities change their values but their pericenters have almost no shift .",
    "moreover , there are fixed points of the system ( [ e18 - 4.7 ] ) , corresponding to the periodic orbits which do not change their form and orientation .",
    "note that the schwarzschield - like metrics can be constructed if boundary conditions ( at infinity ) correspond to the space of constant curvature as it shown by chernikov ( 1992 ) . and also the restricted two - body problem can be generalized for such metrics .",
    "it is clear that the velocity of the perihelion shift depends on both  @xmath110 and @xmath115 .",
    "consider the restricted two - body problem on the sphere  @xmath2 in the general case without assumption that the curvature is small .",
    "we define the new variables  @xmath43 , @xmath154 using the map  @xmath155 , by @xmath156 here , the canonical poisson brackets  @xmath157 are transformed to the lie  poisson brackets corresponding to  @xmath158 algebra .",

    "( incidentally , hamilton noticed a similar thing , in the two - dimensional kepler problem ) .",
    "indeed in the consequence of @xmath168 we have @xmath169 and using the equation ( [ e12 ] ) we obtain @xmath170 @xmath171 where @xmath70 is a longitude on the sphere @xmath172 . eliminating @xmath173 from the last equation we can get @xmath174    for  @xmath175 , according to the liouville  arnold theorem , an additional integral must exist the system to be completely integrable .",
    "we will show soon that in the general case , the additional integral does not exist ( see also borisov et al .",
