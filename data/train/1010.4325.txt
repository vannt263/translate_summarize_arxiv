    "controlling the direction of motion of a quantum mechanical wave packed has received much interest , e.g.  in the context of unidirectional rotational motion@xcite . in the present work we will investigate unidirectional excitation transfer in assemblies of monomers that interact via resonant dipole - dipole interaction ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) . among the various examples are molecular aggregates @xcite , organic molecular solids @xcite , light harvesting systems @xcite , chains of quantum dots , or chains of ultra - cold rydberg atoms @xcite . in all these systems",
    "the transport of electronic excitation can adequately be described by the exciton theory of frenkel @xcite , where electronic excitation localized on a monomer can be transferred to another monomer due to transition dipole - dipole interaction .    in most of the studies of this excitation transfer",
    "usually the initial condition is taken in such a way that the excitation is localized on a _ single _ monomer , i.e.  one monomer is electronically excited and all the others are in their electronic ground state ( e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite ) very little attention is paid to the investigation of initial states that extend over several monomers .",
    "in this situation , initial phase relations between different monomers play an important role @xcite . with the increasing capability to create artificial structures , controlling the initial condition can be used to tailor the properties of such systems .",
    "one possibility to create a state where excitation is distributed coherently over several monomers , is to use electromagnetic radiation that has a definite phase relation between different monomers .",
    "since for a typical molecular aggregate@xcite the distance between the monomers is in the oder of a few ngstrm and the excitation wavelength is in the visible , direct addressing of individual chromophores is quite difficult and would probably require the use of near - field methods . for chains of ultra - cold rydberg atoms , where the distances between the monomers can be in the @xmath0 m range @xcite",
    ", this addressing should be easier to achiv and in principle be possible with present - day technology .    in this work",
    "it is pointed out that , even for an initial state in which the excitation is delocalized only over two neighboring monomers , it is possible to obtain very strong unidirectional transport along a one - dimensional chain by a suitable choice of the relative phase between the excitations of neighboring monomers . to investigate the robustness of the directionality against fluctuations of the surroundings we describe the interaction of the frenkel exciton with its environment within the haken - reineker - strobl model , including pure dephasing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : describ ] we specify the system considered and the initial states . in section [ sec : numerics ] numerical calculations are performed to illustrate the influence of the relative phase on the direction of transport . here",
    "also the interplay with the environment is investigated . in section [ sec : analytics ] we give intuitive analytical explanations for the observed directionality .",
    "in particular , an exact formula for the time - dependent mean - position of the excitation is derived , including the interaction with the environment . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude with a summary of our findings and give a brief outlook .",
    "we consider a one dimensional array of @xmath1 monomers .",

    "the energy difference between the two states is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "since we focus on the transport of a single exctation , only aggregate stats of the form @xmath6 where monomer @xmath4 is excited and all the others are in their ground state , are taken into account .",
    "the aggregate is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 corresponding to a simple frenkel exciton model @xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix element @xmath8 is typically taken to be of dipole - dipole form with a distance dependence @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the positions of monomer @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "we focus on a one - dimensional regular chain of equidistantly spaced monomers and use @xmath13 where @xmath14 scales the interaction strength between the monomers . in the following",
    "we take @xmath15 independent of the monomer index @xmath4 .",
    "following the approach of haken , reineker and strobl @xcite , the interaction of the monomers with the surroundings is taken into account by the time dependent hamiltonian @xmath16 here @xmath17 are stochastic environment fluctuations which couple to the excitation on monomer @xmath4 .",

    "is mostly lost and the mean @xmath94 slowly approaches its long time limit @xmath116    after this discussion of some general properties of @xmath94 we go back to the special initial condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_ini ] ) with @xmath34 .",
    "then , as already noted above , one has @xmath117 . for given @xmath14 and @xmath118 the direction of transport",
    "is solely determined by the phase @xmath37 .",
    "we find that for @xmath119 the transport is directed to the right ( for positive @xmath118 and @xmath14 ) with maximum at @xmath120 while for @xmath121 it is directed to the left .",
    "for @xmath48 the situation is symmetric and the mean remains @xmath122 .",
    "note that @xmath118 scales the `` strength '' of directionality . for a fully mixed state ( @xmath123 )",
    "there is no directionality ; for a pure initial state ( @xmath38 ) the directionality is maximal .",
    "in the present work we have investigated how the direction of excitation transfer along a one - dimensional aggregate depends on the relative phase between two initially excited monomers .",
    "it was found that in the case , when there is no interaction with the environment , for a phase difference of @xmath124 more than 80% of the excitation propagates into one direction .",
    "the direction depends on the sign of the phase . for smaller phase differences the directionality decreases .",
    "the same holds , if the initial state is not pure . as expected interaction with an environment , which destroys phase relations between excitations on different monomers , leads to a strong decrease of the directionality . in this case , the directionality of the propagating wave - packet is only conserved on timescales of the order of the dephasing time .",
    "this dependence on the initial phase is also reflected in the time - dependence of the mean of the excitation .",
    "for this quantity exact analytical results have been derived , showing in particular that initially the velocity of the mean is given by the product of the transfer - interaction between the monomers and the sine of the phase - difference in the initial state . in the fully coherent case",
    "this velocity remains constant ; with dephasing the velocity decreases exponentially on the timescale of the dephasing time . while fluctuations of the environment can often be helpful to enhance the transport efficiency of excitonic energy @xcite , in the present case the coherence is essential for the directed transport to persist . in this context",
    "it is also appropriate to briefly discuss the influence of internal vibrations of the monomers as they are present e.g.  in aggregates of organic dyes @xcite .",
    "we have performed preliminary calculations to obtain a feeling how the directionality is affected by these vibrations . for a single undamped vibrational mode per monomer",
    ", we used the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite which is based on the `` coherent exciton scattering '' approximation which allows to treat chains up to hundred monomers .",
    "we found that the inclusion of a single vibrational mode per monomer barely alters the degree of directionality compared to the purely electronic case of section  [ sec : analytics_coherent ] .",
    "however , similar to the findings in ref .",
    "@xcite the velocity of propagation is slowed down . to assess the influence of many ( damped ) vibrational modes we used the non - markovian quantum state diffusion ( nmqsd ) approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , which allows to treat continuous spectral densities . for a markovian environment",
    "the nmqsd approach can be shown to be equivalent to the master equation ( [ eq : dot_rho_nm ] ) .",
    "considering environments that are no longer markovian ( e.g.  weakly damped vibrational modes ) the resulting transfer has a complicated behavior showing both dephasing as well as the influence of individual vibrational modes , which requires further investigations .",
    "however , our investigations indicate that the inclusion of vibrational modes does not substantially alter the results found in the present article .      note that for initial states that consist of coherent superpositions of a large number of monomers a better directionality is possible .",
    "for example , we found that when the excitation is delocalised over four monomers the directionality can already exceed 90% .",
    "clearly , when the number of monomers that initially are excited coherently becomes even larger a nearly perfect directionality is possible , e.g. for a gaussian distribution of @xmath79 values around a certain mean wave vector @xmath126 ( this results in a gaussian wave packet in @xmath4-space ) .",
    "the present study shows , that even for the smallest possible superposition ( involving excitation of only two monomers ) pronounced directionality is possible . in this regard",
    "it is noteworthy that the directed transfer also works for arrangements where the interaction between neighboring monomers is no longer equal . in nature",
    "this is the case e.g.  in the lh2 complex of purple bacteria . in artificial systems one might design the couplings ( e.g.  by changing the distance or orientations between the monomers ) such that the propagating wave packet has certain properties like a minimal spread over the monomers or the refocusing at a certain monomer . that such tailoring of the aggregate properties can be combined with the directionality induced by the initial phase",
    "is exemplarily shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optimal ] for nearest neighbor interactions as given in panel ( a ) , chosen such that the initial excitation is focused at the end points of the chain .",
    "this might stimulate new ideas how to employ the excitonic phase in molecular devices .",
    "the directionality imposed by the relative phase in coherent superpositions of localized states might even play a role in the energy transfer in natural light harvesting systems@xcite , when partly delocalized excitations `` hop '' from one complex to the next and the exciton remains delocalized over a small number of monomers ."
