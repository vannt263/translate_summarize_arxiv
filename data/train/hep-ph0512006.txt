    "the understanding of the strong and weak interactions of a heavy quark system is an important topic , and the purely leptonic decays @xmath7 seems to be the useful tools for this purpose . in particular , these processes are very simple in that no hadrons and photons appear in the final states .",
    "however , the rates of these purely leptonic decays are helicity suppressed with the factor of @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( the @xmath11 channel , in spite of no suppression , is hard to observe the decay because of the low efficiency ) .",
    "therefore it is natural to extend the purely leptonic @xmath12 decay searches to the corresponding radiative modes @xmath5 .",
    "these radiative leptonic decays receive two types of contributions : inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) and structure - dependent ( sd ) @xcite .",
    "as is known , the ib contributions are still helicity suppressed , while the sd ones are reduced by the fine structure constant @xmath13 but they are not suppressed by the lepton mass .",
    "accordingly , the radiative leptonic @xmath12 decay rates could have an enhancement with respect to the purely leptonic ones , and would offer useful information about the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath14 and the decay constant @xmath15 @xcite . recently",
    ", there has been a great deal of theoretical attention @xcite to these radiative leptonic @xmath12 decays .",
    "experimentally , the current upper limits for these modes are @xmath16 and @xmath17 at the @xmath18 confidence level @xcite . with the better statistic expected from the @xmath12 factories ,",
    "the observations of these decays could become soon feasible .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements responsible for the above decays can be calculated in various quark models .",
    "however , the relativistic effects must be considered seriously in calculations as the recoil momentum is large .",
    "this problem is taken into account by the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) @xcite which has been considered as one of the best effective relativistic quark models in the description of the exclusive heavy hadron decays @xcite .",
    "its simple expression , relativistic structure and predictive power have made wide applications of the lfqm in exploring and predicting the intrinsic heavy hadron dynamics .",
    "however , almost all the previous investigations have not covariantly extracted the form factors from the relevant matrix elements and paid enough attention to the consistency with heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) and heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) . the covariant light - front model @xcite has resolved the above - mentioned shortcomings in the lfqm and has improved the current understanding of the qcd analysis of heavy hadrons .",
    "this model consists of a heavy meson bound state in the heavy quark limit ( namely @xmath19 ) , which is fully consistent with hqs , plus a reliable approach from this bound state to systematically calculate the @xmath20 corrections within hqet in terms of the @xmath20 expansion of the fundamental qcd theory . in this paper",
    ", we will use the covariant light - front model to investigate the radiative leptonic @xmath12 decays in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 a general construction of covariant light - front bound states is provided , the diagrammatic rules within this model are also listed . in sec .",
    "3 we evaluate the decay constant of heavy meson @xmath2 and the form factors of the radiative leptonic heavy meson decay @xmath21 in a complete covariant way . in sec .",
    "4 the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath0 is obtained .",
    "a few numerical calculations made with the help of the gaussian - type wave function are presented .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "the light - front bound states of heavy meson that are written in a form of exhibiting explicitly the boost covariance have been shown in the literature @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the bound states of heavy mesons in the heavy quark limit : @xmath22[d^3p_q ] 2(2\\pi)^3v^+ \\delta^3 (      \\overline{\\lambda}v - k - p_q ) \\nonumber \\\\      & \\times & \\sum_{\\lambda_q,\\lambda_q }      r^{ss_z } ( x , \\kappa_{\\bot } , \\lambda_q , \\lambda_q ) \\phi^{ss_z } ( x,\\kappa^2_{\\bot } )      b_v^\\dagger(k , \\lambda_q ) d_q^\\dagger ( p_q , \\lambda_q)|0\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the velocity of the heavy meson , @xmath24 is the residual momentum of heavy quark , @xmath25 is the momentum of light antiquark , @xmath26 = { dk^+ d^2 k_\\bot \\over { 2(2\\pi)^3 v^+}},~~[d^3p_q ] = { dp_q^+ d^2 p_{q\\bot } \\over { 2(2\\pi)^3 p_q^+}},\\ ] ] and @xmath27 is the residual center mass of heavy mesons . the relative momentum @xmath28 was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as the product of longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath29 of the valence antiquark and the mass of heavy meson @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 .",
    "the relative transverse and longitudinal momenta , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are obtained by @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ hqslfb ] ) , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are helicities of heavy quark and light antiquark , respectively . in phenomenological calculations",
    ", one usually ignores the dynamical dependence of the light - front spin so that the function @xmath37 can be approximately expressed by taking the covariant form for the so - called melosh matrix @xcite in the heavy quark limit , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are spinors for the heavy quark and light antiquark , @xmath41 the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) create a heavy quark and a light antiquark with @xmath44 the normalization of the heavy meson bound states in the heavy quark limit is then given by @xmath45 which leads to two things : first , the heavy meson bound state @xmath46 in this model rescales the one @xmath47 in the lfqm by @xmath48 and , second , the space part @xmath49 ( called the light - front wave function ) in eq.([hqslfb ] ) has the following wave function normalization condition : @xmath50 in principle , the heavy quark dynamics is completely described by hqet , which is given by the @xmath20 expansion of the heavy quark qcd lagrangian @xmath51 therefore , @xmath46 and @xmath52 are then determined by the leading lagrangian @xmath53 .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite have shown from the light - front bound state equation that @xmath52 must be degenerate for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . as a result , we can simply write @xmath56 in the heavy quark limit .",

    "hence , @xmath62 as to the normalization condition of @xmath63 , eq .",
    "( [ nwf ] ) can also be rewritten in a covariant form : @xmath64 the left - hand side of eq .",

    "now , we shall present the evaluations of the decay constants and the form factors for heavy mesons within the covariant light - front model .",
    "first , the decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector mesons are defined by @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath60 and @xmath71 the light and heavy quark field operators , respectively . in the heavy quark limit ,",

    "the dominant contribution comes from the former state , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the charge of light quark in units of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and the hadronic parameter @xmath90",
    "gev@xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the contributions of the latter states are also proportional to @xmath92 , the axial vector meson decay constants . but these are zero because the wave function at the origin for an orbitally excited state vanishes .    in the heavy quark limit , the above form factors have the expressions @xmath93,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 . so that @xmath95 the contributions to these form factors coming from the coupling of the photon to the heavy and light quark can be diagrammatically shown in fig .  3 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . using the above bound states and feynman rules , the former contributions to the form factor , for example ,",
    "@xmath0 are given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the charge of heavy quark in units of @xmath88 and @xmath98 was obtained in eq .",
    "( [ covint1 ] ) . performing the trace and comparing with eq .",
    "( [ decc ] ) , the heavy quark contribution to the form factor @xmath0 is obtained by @xmath99 as obtained from perturbative qcd @xcite . in the case of the light quark contribution",
    ", it can be written as @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 it is easily found @xmath103 using the light - front relative momentum , the integral eq .",
    "( [ fvq ] ) gives @xmath104 with this way , we also calculate the form factors @xmath105 which come from the coupling to the axial vector current and find that @xmath106 .",
    "these results are consistent with those in ref .",
    "@xcite , but contrary to those in nrqm @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been emphasized in the literature that various hadronic form factors calculated in the lfqm should be extracted only from the plus component of the corresponding currents .",
    "also , the lfqm calculations for decay processes are restricted only with a specific lorentz frame ( namely zero momentum transfer ) .",
    "now we see that the covariant light - front model removes the above restrictions , straightforwardly extracts the hadronic form factors @xmath21 , and obtains the result @xmath107 which is consistent with hqs .",
    "at first glance , the decay constant @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ decc1 ] ) does nt seems to connect with @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ fv3 ] ) . however , since the wave function @xmath109 is the function of @xmath110 ( see eq .",
    "( [ cwf ] ) ) for a fully covariant bound state , and @xmath111 , thus @xmath109 is even in @xmath33 .",
    "it follows that @xmath112 from eqs .",
    "( [ kzh ] ) and ( [ odd ] ) , @xmath2 and @xmath108 are easily rewritten in the simpler forms : @xmath113 it is known that @xmath114 , and therefore the ratio ( @xmath115 ) in eq .",
    "( [ fvfh ] ) will be equal to unity when the antiquark is at rest .",
    "thus , in the non - relativistic case , eq .",
    "( [ fvfh ] ) can be reduced to @xmath116 from eq .",
    "( [ nrqm ] ) , one can extract the hadronic parameter @xmath117 which is consistent with the result of the nrqm @xcite . in the relativistic case",
    ", we can evaluate eq .",
    "( [ fvfh ] ) directly to extract @xmath118 .",
    "there are serval popular phenomenological wave function that have been employed to describe various hadronic structure in the literature .",
