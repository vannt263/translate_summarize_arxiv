    "it is now widely accepted that superconductivity in the cuprates is described , as in the standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory , by the condensation of charge @xmath2 cooper pairs of electrons .",
    "however , it has also been apparent that vortices in the superconducting state are not particularly well described by bcs theory . while elementary vortices do carry the bcs flux quantum of @xmath3 , the local electronic density of states in the vortex core , as measured by scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) experiments ,",
    "has not been explained naturally in the bcs framework .",

    "@xcite ) . by",
    "` mott insulator ' we mean here an incompressible state which is pinned to the underlying crystal lattice , with an energy gap to charged excitations . in the mott insulator",
    ", the average number of electrons per unit cell of the crystal lattice , @xmath4 , must be a rational number .",
    "if the mott insulator is not ` fractionalized ' and if @xmath4 is not an even integer , then the mott insulator must also spontaneously break the space group symmetry of the crystal lattice so that the unit cell of the mott insulator has an even integer number of electrons .",
    "there is evidence that the hole - doped cuprates are proximate to a mott insulator with @xmath5 @xcite , and such an assumption will form the basis of our analysis of the stm experiments on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the electron number density in the superfluid state , @xmath6 , need not equal @xmath4 and will be assumed to take arbitrary real values , but not too far from @xmath4 .",
    "a key ingredient in our analysis will be the result that the superfluid carries a subtle quantum order , which is distinct from landau - ginzburg order of a cooper pair condensate . in two dimensions , vortices are point - like excitations , and are therefore bona fide quasiparticle excitations of the superfluid .",
    "the quantum order is reflected in the wavefunction needed to describe the motion of the vortex quasiparticle .",
    "for @xmath4 not an even integer , the low energy vortices appear in multiple degenerate flavors , and the space group symmetry of the underlying lattice is realized in a projective unitary representation that acts on this flavor space . whenever a vortex is pinned ( either individually due to impurities , or collectively in a vortex lattice ) , the space group symmetry is locally broken , and hence the vortex necessarily chooses a preferred orientation in its flavor space . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this implies the presence of modulations in the ldos in the spatial region over which the vortex executes its quantum zero point motion @xcite .",
    "the short - distance structure and period of the modulations is determined by that of the mott insulator at density @xmath4 , while its long - distance envelope is a measure of the amplitude of the vortex wavefunction ( see fig .  [ figfluxlattice ] ) .     where @xmath7 is the wavefunction of the vortices , and its characteristics are computed in the present paper.,width=432 ]    consequently",
    ", the size of the region where the modulations are present is determined by the inertial mass of the vortex . here",
    "we will show how these ideas can be made quantitatively precise , and use current experiments to obtain an estimate of the vortex mass , @xmath8 .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical discussions of @xmath8 using bcs theory @xcite , and they lead to the order of magnitude estimate @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the electron mass , @xmath11 is the fermi wavevector , and @xmath12 is the bcs coherence length .",
    "we begin with a very simple , minimal model computation of the vortex dynamics , in which retardation , dissipation , and inter - layer coulomb interactions will be neglected .",
    "this serves the purpose of exposing the basic physics .",
    "the following section will present a much more complete derivation , in which these effects will be re - instated , and the connection to the field theory analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite will also be made explicit .",
    "consider a system of point vortices moving in a plane at positions @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a label identifying the vortices .",
    "we do not explicitly identify the orientation of each vortex in flavor space , because we are interested here only in the long - distance envelope of the ldos modulations ; the flavor orientation does not affect the interactions between well - separated vortices , and so plays no role in determining the wavefunction of the vortex lattice . in a galilean - invariant superfluid ,",
    "the vortices move under the influence of the magnus force @xmath15 where @xmath16 is time , @xmath17 is planck s constant , @xmath18 is the superfluid velocity at the position @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the electron number density per unit area ( @xmath21 is the area of a unit cell of the underlying lattice ) .",
    "one point of view is that the force in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is that obtained from classical fluid mechanics after imposing the quantization of circulation of a vortex .",
    "however , refs .",
    "@xcite emphasized the robust topological nature of the magnus force and its connection to berry phases , and noted that it applied not only to superfluids of bosons , but quite generally to superconductors of paired electrons .",
    "here , we need the modification of eq .",

    "this was implicit in the results of ref .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the first term proportional to @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the second term .",
    "our notation here is suggestive of a dual formulation of the theory in which the vortices appear as ` charges ' , and these forces are identified as the ` electrical ' and ` magnetic ' components . in the galilean invariant superfluid , the values of @xmath23 and @xmath25 are tied to each other by a galilean transformation . however , with a periodic crystal potential , this constraint no longer applies , and their values renormalize differently as we now discuss .",
    "the influence of the crystal potential on @xmath23 is simple , and replaces the number density of electrons , @xmath6 , by the superfluid density .",
    "determining @xmath26 as a sum of contributions from the other vortices , we obtain @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the superfluid stiffness ( in units of energy ) .",
    "it is related to the london penetration depth , @xmath29 , by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the interlayer spacing .",
    "the modification of @xmath25 is more subtle .",
    "this term states that the vortices are ` charges ' moving in a ` magnetic ' field with @xmath32 ` flux ' quanta per unit cell of the periodic crystal potential .",
    "in other words , the vortex wavefunction is obtained by diagonalizing the hofstadter hamiltonian which describes motion of a charged particle in the presence of a magnetic field and a periodic potential . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is useful to examine this motion in terms of the deviation from the rational ` flux ' @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 are relatively prime integers ) associated with the proximate mott insulator .",
    "the low energy states of the rational flux hofstadter hamiltonian have a @xmath35-fold degeneracy , and this constitutes the vortex flavor space noted earlier @xcite .",

    "a direct theoretical consideration of magnetoconductivity in our picture would have implications for far - infrared or thz spectroscopy , allowing comparison to existing experiments @xcite ; further such experiments on more underdoped samples would also be of interest .",
    "another possibility is that the zero point motion of the vortices emerges in the spectrum of the ldos measured by stm at an energy of order @xmath198 .",
