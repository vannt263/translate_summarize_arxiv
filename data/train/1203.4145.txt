    "jet ( 150 @xmath0 for jupiter and 300 @xmath0 for saturn ) is flanked by multiple alternating zonal winds of weaker amplitudes ( typically tens of @xmath0 ) .",
    "this alternating pattern is observed up to the polar region @xcite .",
    "two competing types of models have tried to address the question of what drives the zonal winds and how deep they reach into the planet ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the `` weather layer '' hypothesis ,",
    "zonal winds are confined to a very thin layer near the cloud level .",
    "such shallow models , that rely on global circulation codes , successfully recover the observed alternating banded structures of zonal flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while earlier shallow models mostly produce rather retro- than prograde equatorial jet , this has been hampered in most recent approaches by adding additional forcing mechanisms , such as moist radiative relaxation at the equator @xcite or condensation of water vapor @xcite . in the `` deep models '' ,",
    "the zonal winds are supposed to extend over the whole molecular envelope ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the direction , the amplitude and the number of jets are reproduced , provided thin shells are assumed and convection is strongly driven @xcite .",
    "the _ in - situ _ measurement by the galileo probe further stimulated the discussion .",
    "they showed that the velocity increases up to 170  @xmath0 over the sampling depth between @xmath2 and 22 bars @xcite .",
    "though this result indicates that the amplitude of zonal winds increases well below the cloud level , it hardly proves the `` deep models '' since the probe has merely scratched the outermost 150  kms of jupiter s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "interior models of the giants planets suggest that hydrogen becomes metallic at about 1.5  mbar , corresponding roughly to 0.85 jupiter s radius and 0.6 saturn s radius @xcite .",
    "this has traditionally been used to independently model the dynamics of the molecular layer without regarding the conducting region .",
    "lorentz forces and increasing density would prevent these strong zonal winds to penetrate significantly into the molecular layer , where timescales thus tend to be slower . however , shock waves experiments suggest that the increase of electrical conductivity is more gradual rather than abrupt @xcite .",
    "@xcite therefore argue that zonal jets must be confined to a thin upper layer ( 0.96 jupiter s radius and 0.86 saturn s radius ) , since deep zonal winds would already generate important ohmic dissipation incompatible with the observed surface flux .",
    "however , @xcite claimed that the kinetic model of @xcite is too simplistic as this does not allow the magnetic field to adjust the differential rotation , which would severely reduce ohmic dissipation .    notwithstanding this open discussion",
    ", the fact that deep models successfully reproduce the primary properties of the zonal jets speaks in their favour .",
    "these models rely on 3-d numerical simulations of rapidly rotating shells ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when convection is strongly driven , the nonlinear inertial term @xmath3 becomes influential and gives rises to reynolds stresses , a statistical correlation between the convective flow components that allows to feed energy into zonal winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "most of these simulations use the boussinesq approximation , which assumes homogeneous reference state .",
    "this seems acceptable for terrestrial planets , but becomes rather dubious for gas planets , where for example the density increases by four orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the anelastic approximation we adopt here , provides a more realistic framework , which allows to incorporate the background density stratification , while filtering out fast acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented 3-d anelastic simulations that showed many interesting differences with the boussinesq results .",
    "the zonal flows still remain large - scale and deep - seated but the local small - scale convection is severely affected by compressibility and strongly depends on radius .",
    "while the main equatorial band remains a robust common feature , it seems more difficult to get stable multiple high latitude jets , even in the most extreme parameters .",
    "@xcite used a modified anelastic approach neglecting viscous heating but including a more realistic equation of state . in their model ,",
    "the zonal flows show a more pronounced variation in the direction of the rotation axis than in the work of @xcite . @xcite and @xcite pointed out that compressibility adds a new vorticity source that could potentially help to generate reynolds stresses that , _ in fine _ ,",
    "maintain zonal flows .",
    "following theses recent studies , we focus here on the effects of compressibility on rapidly rotating convection .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to determine the exact influence of the density background on the driving of zonal flows . to this end",
    ", we have conducted a systematic parametric study for various density stratifications and solutions that span weakly supercritical to strongly nonlinear convection .    in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the anelastic model and the numerical methods .",
    "section  [ sec : flowprop ] presents the results , starting with convection close to the onset and then progressing into the nonlinear regime . in section  [ sec : scaling ] , we concentrate on the zonal winds mechanism and related scaling laws , before concluding in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider thermal convection of an ideal gas in a spherical shell of outer radius @xmath4 and inner radius @xmath5 , rotating at a constant frequency @xmath6 about the @xmath7 axis .",
    "being interested in the dynamics of the molecular region of gas giants , we assume that the mass is concentrated in the inner part , resulting in a gravity @xmath8 . we employ the anelastic approximation following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thermodynamical quantities , such as density , temperature and pressure are decomposed into the sum of an adiabatic reference state ( quantities with overbars ) and a perturbation ( primed quantities ) : @xmath9 when assuming @xmath8 , the polytropic and adiabatic reference state is given by ( see * ? ? ?",

    "for example , @xmath17 corresponds to a density contrast of approximately 20 , while the largest value explored here ( @xmath18 ) implies @xmath19 .",
    "we use a dimensionless formulation , where outer boundaries reference values serve to non - dimensionalise density and temperature .",
    "the shell thickness @xmath20 is used as a length scale , while the viscous diffusion time @xmath21 serves as the time scale , @xmath22 being the constant kinematic viscosity .",
    "entropy is expressed in units of @xmath23 , the small imposed entropy contrast over the layer . the anelastic continuity equation is    @xmath24    while the dimensionless momentum equation is then    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are velocity , pressure and entropy , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is the traceless rate - of - strain tensor with a constant kinematic viscosity , given by    @xmath30    the dimensionless entropy equation then reads    @xmath31    where thermal diffusivity is assumed to be constant . as stated by @xcite , in anelastic simulations with large density stratification ,",
    "viscous heating plays a significant role in the global energy balance .",
    "it involves the dissipation parameter di ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that is given by    @xmath32    in this formulation , turbulent viscosity is expected to dominate over molecular viscosity and therefore thermal diffusion relies mainly on entropy diffusion rather than on temperature diffusion @xcite .",
    "that is why , the turbulent heat flux has been assumed to be proportional to the entropy gradient as in the mixing - length theory @xcite .",
    "in addition to the two anelastic parameters ( the polytropic index @xmath14 and the density stratification @xmath16 ) and the aspect ratio @xmath33 , the three non - dimensional parameters that control the system of equations ( [ eq : anel ] ) , ( [ eq : ns ] ) and ( [ eq : entropy ] ) are the ekman number    @xmath34    the prandtl number    @xmath35    and the rayleigh number    @xmath36    @xmath37 being the gravity at the outer radius , @xmath38 the specific heat , and @xmath39 the thermal diffusivity . this definition of the rayleigh number is based on the entropy jump over the layer and on values of the physical quantities at the outer boundary .",
    "however , for analysing where convection sets in first , the radial dependence of the diffusive entropy gradient has to be considered .",
    "this can be cast into a depth - dependent rayleigh number :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the solution of ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath42 in our simulations , thermal and viscous diffusivities are assumed to be constant , but gravity and entropy vary with radius",
    ". gravity is decreasing outward ( as @xmath8 ) , but the entropy gradient is inversely proportional to @xmath43 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : entropyback ] ) and therefore increases rapidly toward the surface for large density stratifications . as a consequence",
    ", we can see on fig .",
    "[ fig : raprof ] that this local rayleigh number increases outward for density stratification larger than 3 , while it increases downward for weaker density stratifications .     for different background density stratifications @xmath44$].,width=302 ]    several authors argued that rayleigh numbers at mid - depth may offer a more meaningful reference value ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "here we follow @xcite , who suggest to use a mass - weighted average defined as    @xmath45    where the average is defined as @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this new definition of the rayleigh number can be related to the usual one ( eq .  [ eq : racode ] ) , by the coefficient @xmath47 , that has an analytical solution for a polytropic index of @xmath48    @xmath49    moreover , in the limit of small viscosity and thermal diffusivity , the force balance is expected to become independent on viscosity ( low ekman number ) .",
    "therefore , following @xcite and @xcite , it is more relevant to consider a modified rayleigh number that does not depend anymore on diffusivities , defined as    @xmath50    to get a non - dimensional measure of the radial heat transport that is also independent of the thermal diffusivity , we use a modified nusselt number    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the heat flux .",
    "once the simulation has reached the nonlinear saturation , the time - average of this modified nusselt number should become constant with radius as there is no internal heat source in the system .",
    "therefore , there is no need to consider mass - weighted average of this parameter .",
    "finally , it is also useful to analyse our simulations in terms of an alternate rayleigh number based on the heat flux rather than on the entropy contrast @xmath23    @xmath53    this flux - based rayleigh number can be related to the modified nusselt number as follows    @xmath54    once again , this number varies with radius , and therefore it is useful to consider the mass - weighted average counterpart of this quantity    @xmath55      the numerical simulations of this study have been carried out with a modified version of the code magic @xcite . the new anelastic version has been tested and validated against different compressible convection and dynamo benchmarks @xcite . to solve the system of equations ( [ eq : anel ] ) , ( [ eq : ns ] ) and ( [ eq : entropy ] ) in spherical coordinates @xmath56 , the mass flux @xmath57 is decomposed into a poloidal and a toroidal contribution    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the poloidal and toroidal potentials .",

    "the equations for @xmath59 and @xmath60 are obtained by taking the horizontal part of the divergence and the radial component of the curl of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) , respectively .",
    "a more exhaustive description of the numerical method and spectral transforms involved in the computation can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .      in all the simulations presented in this study ,",
    "we have assumed constant entropy and stress - free boundary conditions for the velocity at both limits . under the anelastic approximation ,",

    "we have fixed the aspect ratio @xmath68 to the lower value suggested for the molecular to metallic hydrogen transition in jupiter ( @xmath69 ) and saturn ( @xmath70 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this limits the numerical difficulties associated with thinner shells and therefore allows to reach higher density stratification .",
    "the ekman number is kept fixed at @xmath71 , which is larger than the most extreme values chosen by @xcite but allows us to conduct a large number of simulations . following previous boussinesq studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "being mostly interested in the effects of density stratification on zonal flow generation , we have performed simulations at five different values of @xmath16 @xmath74 that span the range from nearly boussinesq to a density contrast of 150 . in the gas giants ,",

    "figure  [ fig : critical ] demonstrates how larger buoyancy values are more and more confined close to the outer boundary as @xmath16 grows .",

    "typical for this intermittent regime , which has mainly been observed in boussinesq simulations but has also been reported in some anelastic simulations of turbulent convection in solar - like stars @xcite , is that the convective features typically occupy only an azimuthal fraction of the volume .",

    "when the density stratification is increased , however , the solution becomes more small scale and chaotic and the convective columns progressively loose their integrity in the direction of the rotation axis @xcite . this likely prevents the required more global interaction and the related regimes at larger density stratification .",
    "the background density stratification causes significant changes in the convective flow that we discuss first before describing the zonal flows in section  [ zonal ] .",

    "this scale height decreases by a factor of five when going from the inner to the outer boundary , which about explains the variation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vranel ] .",
    "the increase in amplitude can be explained by the variation of the background density : since @xmath13 decreases by a factor of about @xmath94 from @xmath5 to @xmath4 , a rising ( falling ) convective plume compensates this with increasing ( decreasing ) flow amplitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : vranel ] shows an increase of about 60 which seems somewhat on the low side .",
    "however , the radial increase in the number of convective columns and the scale change show that the convective features hardly reach through the whole shell without being modified .",

    "close to the onset of convection , a thin prograde equatorial jet develops in the very outer part of the shell .",

    "the retrograde jet broadens toward higher latitudes until additional flanking prograde jets develop below and above the inner boundary at large rayleigh numbers and confine it to mid latitudes .",
    "the amplitude of these high - latitude jets becomes comparable to that of the equatorial jet for strongly nonlinear simulations ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) , while the retrograde jet vigor intensifies to about 50% of this amplitude . in this multiple jets regime ,",
    "retrograde zonal winds are anchored to the tangent cylinder in a similar way to what was already observed in boussinesq simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strong @xmath7-dependence at low rayleigh numbers is a typical thermal wind feature , which can be understood by considering the @xmath63-component of the curl of the momentum equation ( [ eq : ns ] ) : @xmath100_\\phi . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath101 corresponds to the substantial time derivative and @xmath102 is the azimuthal vorticity component .",
    "for low rayleigh numbers , inertial contributions can be neglected , and the @xmath7-dependence of the zonal flows is ruled by the thermal wind balance : @xmath103 where overlines denote an azimuthal average .",
    "this allows us to define the typical lengthscale @xmath104 for vanishing ekman numbers , @xmath105 approaches infinity and zonal flows become independent of @xmath7 , recovering taylor - proudman theorem and therefore a geostrophic structure . for the lowest rayleigh number solution shown in fig .",

    "the fact that @xmath110 and @xmath76 simulations have a supercriticality that is about three times higher than that of the @xmath84 case , however , implies that significantly larger supercriticalities are required to reach a comparable multiple jet structure when the density stratification is strong .",

    "this gradual outward shift of the onset of convection is explained by the radial increase of buoyancy . * when increasing supercriticality , the solutions which simply drift close to onset , start to vacillate , then become intermittent and finally chaotic @xcite . while these different regimes are clearly separated in the boussinesq cases ,",
    "the transitions occupy a shorter fraction of the parameter space with increase of density stratification . * for stronger background density stratifications , the convective flow amplitude increases",

    "taking an internal heat flux of @xmath179 @xcite , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the evolution models of @xcite suggest that the flux - based rayleigh number decreases from @xmath183 at the surface to @xmath184 at the bottom of the molecular envelope ( i.e. @xmath185 ) .",
    "this leads to a mass - weighted flux based rayleigh number of @xmath186 .",

    "this value is much weaker ( about one order of magnitude ) than the surface zonal winds of gas giants .",
    "this rescaling is however tentative as the scaling laws may still depend on other parameters that have been kept constant in this study , for example ekman number , prandtl number or aspect ratio , and further simulations would be required to clarify this . *",
    "the zonal jets are maintained by reynolds stresses , which rely on the correlation between zonal ( @xmath106 ) and cylindrically radial ( @xmath150 ) flow components .",
    "the gradual loss of this correlation with increasing supercriticality hampers all our simulations , independently of the background density stratification .",
    "however in the strongly stratified simulations , the correlation is first lost in the outer part of the flow , where compressibility effects are most significant . because of the short lengthscales and the large flow amplitudes found there , the fluid parcels loose their identity before interacting efficiently with the zonal flows .",
    "this may explain why the additional compressional source of vorticity has not the important effect expected by @xcite and @xcite in our simulations .",
    "however , the influence of the different vorticity contributions are hard to disentangle in 3-d compressible convection , stressing the need of future theoretical work to address this question .    all the results obtained in this study",
    "have been derived in a non - conducting layer , where magnetic effects have been neglected .",
    "nevertheless , as suggested by @xcite , the ohmic dissipation associated with the outer semi - conducting region could strongly limit the extent of the surface jets .",
