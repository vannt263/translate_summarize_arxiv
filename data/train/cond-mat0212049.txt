    "interest in quantum information processing has brought significant attention to the problem of measurement of tunneling currents via a microscopic system that can be modeled by a two - level hamiltonian ( such as a quantum dot , or a molecule or an atom with a localized spin @xcite ) . in the case of a single spin ,",
    "measurements of the tunneling current in such a system provide information on spin orientation and its dynamics , and they constitute an example of indirect - continuous quantum measurement @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question that arises is what signatures of the spin dynamics are encoded in the tunneling current and how this current affects the spin dynamics .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments @xcite on a single molecule with a spin , in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath0 , have reported a peak in the current noise power spectrum ( i.e. , current - current correlation function ) @xmath15 at the larmor frequency @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "experiments were done at room temperature and the authors found that the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath11 ( ratio of the power at the peak frequency to the shot noise power ) exceeded unity and was almost independent of the orientation of the applied magnetic field @xmath0 . in the non - relativistic approach the tunneling electrons couple to the spin by exchange interaction . in this case , electrons with a spin polarization along @xmath0 do not couple with the oscillatory components of the spin ( which are perpendicular to @xmath0 ) .",
    "the experimental results @xcite are difficult to explain in the framework of a single - spin non - relativistic model since electrons in the leads were polarized by the same magnetic field which acted on the spin .",
    "possible relevance of spin - orbit interaction to explain these data was discussed by shachal and manassen and later on by balatsky and martin @xcite .",
    "recently , levitov and rashba @xcite noticed that in systems with low space symmetry ( as in dots or a molecule near a surface ) the nonvanishing orbital moment of electrons near the spin ( in the dot or molecule ) provides a strong coupling of the tunneling electrons to the spin , and they speculated that this mechanism may lead to a significant effect of the spin oscillatory component on the tunneling current .",
    "in fact , in order to fit the experimental data @xcite one needs a model of electron tunneling via a single spin which is able to explain not only the existence of a peak in the current power spectrum , but also a significant signal - to - noise ratio @xmath18 almost independent of the orientation of @xmath0 .",
    "in the following we consider a model with exchange ( non - relativistic ) coupling of a single spin @xmath19 and the tunneling electrons , including spin - orbit coupling . in the framework of this model",
    "we analyze the dependence of @xmath11 and linewidth @xmath20 on the applied voltage @xmath1 between leads , the applied magnetic field @xmath0 , the temperature @xmath2 , and on the degree and orientation @xmath21 of electron polarization in the right ( @xmath4r ) and left ( @xmath4l ) leads in the steady state .",
    "this state establishes in a transient time after the voltage or tunneling matrix elements are switched on .",
    "the problem of tunneling via a single localized spin @xmath19 is similar to the problem of tunneling via a double quantum dot ( two - level system ) extensively studied by korotkov and averin @xcite and by ruskov and korotkov @xcite .",
    "indeed , they were interested in the question of how quantum oscillations in the two - level system , representing a qubit , may be detected by a tunneling current .",
    "such a system can be described by a model of electron tunneling via a spin when leads electrons are fully polarized . using the bloch equations describing the ensemble - averaged evolution of the density matrix for the coupled qubit - detector system",
    ", they obtained oscillations at the larmor frequency in the noise power spectrum @xmath22 , with @xmath23 in the case of weak interaction between the qubit and the detector .",
    "a similar quasi - classical approach for tunneling of electrons via a single spin was used in ref .",
    "in such an approximation , the action of the electrons on the spin is replaced by the action of an effective _ classical _ magnetic field with a shot noise spectrum depending on the tunneling current between the leads .",
    "this approach has sense at high currents ( voltages ) , while at low currents it does not account for the quantum nature of the tunneling electrons and hence a more elaborate solution of the quantum transport equation for both spin and electrons is desired .",
    "here the situation is formally similar to the case of the photo - electric effect where in some circumstances a full quantum mechanical treatment of the problem provides the same information as a semi - classical approach , while in other cases , such as the measurement of the statistics of the photo - current fluctuations , the predictions of the two approaches differ qualitatively @xcite .",
    "an important step toward a full quantum mechanical treatment of electron tunneling via a spin was recently given by parcollet and hooley @xcite .",
    "assuming that the spin interacts only with the tunneling electrons , and electrons in the leads are in a voltage driven thermal equilibrium , they computed the spin magnetization of a quantum dot in the two - leads kondo model as a function of the temperature of the electrons , magnetic field , and voltage between the leads ( which exceeds the kondo temperature @xmath24 ) in the steady state , i.e. , in the long time limit .",
    "they considered the situation where electrons in the leads are polarized in the same direction as the magnetic field acting on the spin , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "their calculations confirmed previously obtained quasi - classical result @xcite that , in the steady state even at zero order in the spin - leads coupling , the magnetization is not given by the thermal equilibrium expression @xmath27 when the spin is more strongly coupled to the leads than to any other thermal bath . at long times , the state of the spin is completely determined by the characteristics of the tunneling electrons , and since the system is out of equilibrium , the steady state thus achieved is described by a steady state distribution function which differs from the gibbs distribution .",
    "it turns out that this distribution function depends upon the voltage between the leads .",
    "they also showed that the correct way to calculate the perturbative corrections to the spin distribution function and the spin decoherence rate @xmath20 in the steady state is by solving a quantum transport equation self - consistently .",
    "we will extend the treatment of parcollet and hooley to arbitrary orientations of @xmath28 , and @xmath29 with respect to @xmath0 , and account for a direct tunneling of electrons between leads .",
    "the main goals in this article are ( i ) to examine under what tunneling conditions the current - current correlation function @xmath22 exhibits a peak at the larmor frequency in the steady state , and ( ii ) to calculate @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the regime where @xmath32 , with @xmath33 denoting the charge of the electron . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we use the keldysh formalism @xcite and the majorana - fermion representation @xcite for the spin to find the spin distribution function and the current - current correlation function .",
    "we note , from a more general perspective , that the problem of electron tunneling via a spin represents an example of indirect quantum measurement .",
    "the spin is probed by the tunneling electrons whose correlation function is measured in a continuous fashion with a classical apparatus ( which is not included ) . the goal of quantum measurement is to determine the frequency of precession of the isolated spin ( energy separation in the isolated two - level system ) and to obtain information on the initial state of the system .",
    "however , when the spin is decoupled from the environment , tunneling via the spin changes its state as the measurement goes on . after switching on the voltage , or the tunneling matrix elements , there is an initial period of time where the tunneling current depends upon the initial state of the spin .",
    "after some transient time the steady state , which is in general independent of the initial conditions , establishes . in the steady state",
    "the frequency of precession is renormalized by the tunneling electrons , and the width of the peak ( at the precession frequency ) and corresponding signal - to - noise ratio depend upon the precession frequency and characteristics of the tunneling electrons . to extract information about the precession of the isolated spin one needs to have complete information on the tunneling electrons .",
    "we show how to relate the precession frequency of the isolated spin to results of current measurements in the steady state ( peak frequency , width of the peak and signal - to - noise ratio ) .",
    "to obtain information on the initial state of the spin , measurements of the current during the initial transient period are needed . here",
    "we do not consider the spin dynamics in this short time interval .",
    "the plan of the article is the following . in the next section we present the model for tunneling via a single spin 1/2 , with and without spin - orbit coupling , and a model describing tunneling via a two - level quantum dot .",
    "then we introduce majorana fermions and the keldysh technique . in the subsequent section",
    "we will compute the spin distribution function , broadening of the spin precession due to the tunneling of electrons , and the spin - spin correlation function .",
    "then we will calculate the dependence of the tunneling current on the spin and determine the current - current correlation function @xmath22 .",
    "finally , we discuss the stm experimental results and compare our results to those obtained in the quasiclassical approach @xcite and other theoretical works @xcite .",
    "for the system consisting of a spin coupled to the leads by an exchange mechanism ( in the non - relativistic approximation , i.e. , neglecting the spin - orbit interaction ) , we use the hamiltonian of the two - leads kondo model @xcite with a direct tunneling term included ( which we call tunneling - via - spin ( tvs ) model ) @xmath34 c^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha n \\sigma}c^{\\;}_{\\alpha n \\sigma ' } , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal h}_s&=&-g\\mu_b { \\bf b}_0\\cdot{\\bf s } , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal h}_{\\sf ref}&=&\\!\\!\\!\\ ! \\sum_{\\alpha , n , n ' \\sigma , \\sigma'}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "* 3*. when the electrons are polarized and @xmath10 , on the background of frequency - independent shot noise caused by the discrete nature of the electrons , there is a peak in the current noise power @xmath467/2 $ ] at the renormalized larmor frequency , caused by the precession of the spin excited by the tunneling electrons .",
    "this peak is absent when @xmath292 because the spin is in the ground state since electrons do not have enough energy to flip it .",
    "* 4*. the signal - to - noise ratio for this peak , @xmath468 , strongly depends upon the degree of spin polarization of the leads - electrons and the orientation of this polarization with respect to the external magnetic field @xmath0 acting on the localized spin .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath11 is reached when the electrons are polarized in a direction perpendicular to the effective magnetic field acting on the spin because in this case they probe in an optimal way the precessing spin components .",
    "when the relaxation of the localized spin with the environment is weak , @xmath11 reaches the values of order unity * only * if the leads are almost fully polarized in a direction close to perpendicular to @xmath6 .",
    "* 5*. in the case of full polarization and @xmath469 at low temperatures @xmath470 , the dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath295 is given by eq .",

    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is reduced by the presence of the electron reflection couplings ( @xmath473 ) as expected , since this process does not contribute to the current but does affect the width of the peak .",
    "* 6*. when the spin relaxation due to the environment is negligible , the peak width in the noise power spectrum ( at the renormalized larmor frequency ) depends weakly on the orientation of the polarization .",
    "it increases linearly with @xmath1 , when @xmath474 and the tunneling electrons cause spin flips , see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath475 , the width of the peak is determined by @xmath2 ( @xmath476 ) .",
    "* 7*. in points 2 through 4 we assumed that the spin relaxation with the environment , @xmath84 , was negligible in comparison to the relaxation due to the leads - electrons , @xmath326 .",
    "this assumption is crucial to obtain a maximum @xmath11 of order unity because in this case @xmath477 , and @xmath478 , so that @xmath11 does not depend on the small parameter @xmath479 , see eq .",
    "( [ sis ] ) .",
    "if the spin relaxation rate due to the environment dominates we get @xmath480 .",
    "* 8*. for weak polarization of the electrons , @xmath11 becomes proportional to the degree of polarization , @xmath481 , where @xmath228 is the magnetic or exchange field acting on the leads - electrons and @xmath58 represents their bandwidth .",
    "this is because only polarized tunneling electrons contribute to the signal at the larmor frequency , while all tunneling electrons contribute to the broadening of this signal .",
    "we estimate @xmath482 for @xmath483 g and @xmath484 ev and this estimate leads to @xmath485 .    *",
    "9*. spin - orbit ( i.e. , relativistic @xmath486 ) corrections of any type @xcite can only provide a very small signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath487 , in the situation where the exchange coupling leads to a vanishing signal ( i.e. , the electrons are unpolarized or they are polarized parallel to @xmath0 ) . the signal in this case",
    "is determined by the relativistic coupling between the spin and the tunneling electrons , while the broadening is determined by the dominant non - relativistic exchange coupling .",
    "hence , for a tunneling process via a single localized spin in the steady state , the signal - to - noise ratio becomes of order unity * only * when + a ) the spin is decoupled from the environment , and + b ) the electrons are almost fully polarized in a direction perpendicular to the effective field acting on the localized spin .",
    "* 10*. we derived the correction to the standard shot noise power caused by the presence of the localized spin when the leads - electrons are unpolarized .",
    "this correction is small when @xmath488 , but it changes behavior at @xmath355 , see eqs .",
    "( [ spinn ] ) , and ( [ spinun ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard shot noise power increases linearly with v. this new result can be observed , in principle , experimentally .",
    "we are now in position to compare our results to the experimental data obtained by manassen et al .",
    "@xcite and durkan and welland @xcite , and decide whether the model of tunneling via a single localized spin can explain these data . in these experiments",
    "the polarization of the electrodes was weak , @xmath11 was of order unity or larger almost independently of the orientation of the applied magnetic field , and the position of the peak in the noise power spectrum @xmath15 was found at the larmor frequency corresponding to the applied magnetic field .",
    "our results show that a combination of weak polarization and a signal - to - noise ratio of order unity are incompatible for the dc steady state described by our model , which accounts for both exchange and spin - orbit coupling of the tunneling electrons and the localized spin .      from the point of view of the theory of quantum measurement",
    "we see that after a long time , any measurement usually leads to a steady state where information on the initial state of the quantum system is probably lost .",
    "hence , an important question is what is the transient time for a given measurement .",
    "we note that @xmath358 and the contribution @xmath396 in the current - current correlation function are proportional to the spin - spin correlation function @xmath489 and @xmath490 , respectively ( if the electrons are spin polarized along the @xmath319-axis ) .",
    "suppose that one wants to probe a single spin , say a , which is part of an ensemble of other spins interacting with each other .",
    "measurement of the @xmath357-@xmath1 characteristics , namely @xmath358 , and current noise power , @xmath22 , at low voltages will carry information on the dynamics of that particular ( coupled ) spin a , whenever tunneling occurs via that single spin . effectively , because of the coupling , that measurement provides information on the dynamics of the whole system and eqs .",
    "( [ peak ] ) and ( [ gr ] ) form the background for such tunneling spectroscopy of quantum systems .",
    "note , however , that the subject of study , the spin - spin correlation function , is affected by tunneling measurements ( see the way the bare spin - spin correlation function , eq .",
    "( [ bare ] ) , was modified in the case of a single - spin system , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) ) . we have shown how this modification may be accounted for in the case of steady - state measurements of a single - spin system . in a similar way it may be accounted for in more complicated systems , and corrections to obtain the bare correlation function of the system studied can , in principle , be made .",
    "we note that we presented here a theoretical description of the tunneling spectroscopy of a single localized spin-1/2 system .",
    "however , such a description is also valid for any two - level system ( quantum dot ) , and eq .",
    "( [ transl ] ) describes the mapping between the two - level system and the spin-1/2 system .    in conclusion",

    "we found optimal conditions when the tunneling current carries maximum information about dynamic quantum fluctuations of the localized spin .",
