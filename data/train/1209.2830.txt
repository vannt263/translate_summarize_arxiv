    "but the spherical surface is independent of time , since the time dependency is in the integrand of the last line of ( [ eq theorem 2 007 ] ) .",
    "this is , at every time , for every spherical surface , there exist a volume , which is a function of time , that converges to the sphere",
    ". then ( [ eq theorem 2 001 ] ) is held at every instant of time .",
    "given that we have a surface integral , it does not matter what is the velocity distribution inside the sphere but just that velocity distribution on its surface . therefore , this theorem asserts that if there exist at least a sphere in the domain of the incompressible velocity field that violates ( [ eq theorem 2 001 ] ) , evolution with time is forbidden for that velocity field .",

    "this lemma means that if we find at least a spherical surface for which the incompressible velocity field does not hold ( [ eq lemma 1 002 ] ) , that field can not evolve acording to navier  stokes equations .",
    "notice that the lemma is only useful when the inequality is violated .",
    "lets see it with three examples .    at time",
    "@xmath51 , let a velocity field be given by @xmath52 ( in spherical coordinates ) inside a bigger sphere of ratio @xmath53 .",
    "the fluid of this velocity field spins around the @xmath54 axis and is divergent - free .",
    "we would like to confirm that ( [ eq lemma 1 002 ] ) is correct .",
    "the computation of ( [ eq lemma 1 003 ] ) and ( [ eq lemma 1 004 ] ) to this velocity field gives @xmath55 computation of double radium derivative of pressure is more difficult .",
    "we can work out the pressure , as usual , by solving the poisson equation obtained when we take the divergence of incompressible navier - stokes equations ( [ eq lemma 1 001 ] ) .",
    "so , this non - local function of spatial derivatives of velocity is @xmath56 in our case , the corresponding derivations and integration in the sphere of radium @xmath53 gives us @xmath57 being @xmath58 .",
    "then , the double time derivative of the surface area that converges to a sphere of radium @xmath17 in this velocity field is @xmath59 this time , the result does agree with the inequality ( [ eq lemma 1 002 ] ) . but still remains regions of the @xmath60 where we can look for violation of the inequality .",
    "now , the system of reference is shifted a distance @xmath61 from the @xmath54 axis along @xmath62 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , instead of be on it . with the identities given by @xmath63    we can change @xmath64 by @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "of course , this velocity field still has @xmath24 . repeating again the steps like before , we find @xmath67 and hence , @xmath68 this result also agrees with the inequality ( [ eq lemma 1 002 ] ) . moreover , it is independent of the radium @xmath53 .",
    "so , this inequality can be extrapolated to @xmath60 doing @xmath69 or @xmath70 and using revolution symmetry around @xmath71 axis .    in this example",
    ", we will see that the divergent - free velocity field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) given in spherical coordinates , at a time @xmath51 , by @xmath72 with @xmath73 , does not hold the inequality ( [ eq lemma 1 002 ] ) for every sphere that is inside a bigger sphere of radium @xmath53 .",
    "as before , first we compute @xmath74 , @xmath75 from velocity and its derivatives , and then , @xmath40 from them and from the integral over the sphere of radium @xmath53 ( being @xmath76 ) .",
    "so , we obtain @xmath77\\sin \\theta ' p_{n}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\theta-\\theta'\\right)\\right)d \\theta ' \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\left(\\frac{1}{2k+1}-\\ln\\frac{r}{r}\\right)r^{2k}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int^{\\pi}_{0}\\left[\\left(k-1\\right)\\sin^2 \\theta ' + 1\\right]\\sin \\theta ' p_{2k}\\left(\\cos \\left(\\theta-\\theta'\\right)\\right)d \\theta ' \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq examp 2 003 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are legrendre polimominals ) and hence , @xmath80a_n\\nonumber\\\\",

    "moreover , we have used @xmath53 as a parameter to compute the pressure and we can make it very large . when @xmath84 , we can approach ( [ eq examp 2 004 ] ) by @xmath85 however , since @xmath86 , it is impossible that it holds the inequality @xmath87 so we conclude that surprisingly the velocity field ( [ eq examp 2 001 ] ) can not evolve according to incompressible navier - stokes equations .    in this last example , we will see that the divergent - free velocity field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) given , at a time @xmath51 , by @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , does not hold the inequality ( [ eq lemma 1 002 ] ) for every sphere . proceeding as before",
    ", we again compute @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath40 , this one worked out throught an integral over all three dimensional space .",
    "so , we obtain @xmath91 and hence , @xmath92 however , the inequality ( [ eq lemma 1 002 ] ) does not hold when the radius of the probe sphere is @xmath93 then , the velocity field ( [ eq examp 3 001 ] ) can not evolve according to incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "we have shown that given an incompressible velocity field at a initial time , we can test whether its time evolution is forbidden by a criterion .",
    "it is related with the non - negativeness of the double time derivative of the area of a volume that becomes a sphere at that instant .",
    "of course , if velocity agrees the inequality at a give time it also agrees that the reminder of the time , because in other case , the field had not evolved to reach that instant .",
    "in particular we have worked the inequality out to a navier  stokes fluids .",
    "we also have found two particular incompressible velocity fields that can not evolve acording to navier ",
