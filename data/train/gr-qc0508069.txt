    "astronomical observation on the cosmic microwave background(cmb ) anisotropy @xcite , supernova type ia(snia ) @xcite and sloan digital sky survey(sdss ) @xcite converge on that our universe is spatially flat , with about @xmath0 of the total density resulting from dark energy that has an equation of state @xmath1 and drives the accelerating expansion of the universe which began at a redshift of order one - half .",
    "the origin of the dark energy remains elusive from the point of view of general relativity and standard particle physics . to represent dark energy , several candidates",
    "have been suggested and confronted with observation : a cosmological constant , quintessence with a single field @xcite or with @xmath2 coupled field @xcite , a phantom field with a canonical @xcite or born - infield type lagrangian @xcite , @xmath3-essence @xcite and the generalized chaplygin gas(gcg ) @xcite . among these models ,",
    "the most typical ones are cosmological constant and quintessence which has caught much attention ever since its invention .",
    "the idea of inflation is legitimately regarded as an great advancement of modern cosmology : it solves the horizon , flatness and monopole problem , and it provides a mechanism for the generation of density perturbations needed to seed the formation of structures in the universe . in standard inflationary models ,",
    "the physics lies in the inflation potential .",
    "the underlying dynamics is simply that of a single scalar field rolling in its potential .",
    "this scenario is generically referred to as chaotic inflation in reference to its choice of initial conditions .",
    "this picture is widely favored because of its simplicity and has received by far the most attention to date .",
    "the properties of inflationary models are also tightly constraint by the recent result from the observation .",
    "the standard inflationary @xmath4cdm model provides a good fit to the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy .",
    "peebles and vilenkin proposed and quantitatively analyzed the intriguing idea @xcite that a substantial fraction of the present cosmic energy density could reside in the vacuum potential energy of the scalar field responsible for inflation ( quintessential inflation ) . after that , there were some models to be presented in succession .    in this paper , we wish to point out the possibility of using a complex scalar field to account for the inflationary stage and the current acceleration .",
    "we put the emphasis on the study of the dynamics . according to the phase space analysis and numerical calculation ,",
    "we show that how the amplitude of complex field plays the role of the inflaton whereas the phase is the quintessence field .",
    "there are stable and unstable critical points for our model . in our case ,",
    "one of the unstable critical point is corresponding to the inflationary stage at very first moments of the universe and the stable critical point is corresponding to the second stage of accelerated expansion began at a redshift @xmath5 and is still operative , which alleviates the fine tuning problem .",
    "the equation of state @xmath6 varies with the cosmic evolution and approaches towards -1 asymptotically showing the existence of a cosmological constant at late times .",
    "the heteroclinic orbits @xcite connect unstable and stable critical points .",
    "the numerical calculation shows that brought the universe back to the usual friedman - robertson - walker expansion , then the second stage of accelerated expansion began at @xmath7 .",
    "since current observations favour a flat universe , we will work in the spatially flat robertson - walker metric ,    @xmath8    the lagrangian density for the spatially homogeneous complex scalar field @xmath9 is @xmath10 when consider the presence of barotropic fluid , the action for the model is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath16 is the density of the fluid with a barotropic equation of state @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant that relates to the equation of state by @xmath19 .",
    "writing the complex field @xmath20 as ( see @xcite ) @xmath21 substituting ( [ definition ] ) into ( [ lagrangian ] ) and varying the action , one can obtain the einstein equations and the equations of motion for the scalar field as    @xmath22,\\\\ \\label{doth } \\dot h = -\\frac{\\kappa^2}{2 } \\left[\\rho_{\\gamma}+p_\\gamma + \\dot{\\phi}^{2}+ \\frac { \\phi^{2}}{f^2 } \\dot{\\theta}^{2 } \\right],\\\\ \\label{dotrho } \\dot{\\rho_\\gamma}=-3h(\\rho_\\gamma+p_\\gamma),\\\\ \\label{ddotphi }   \\ddot{\\phi } + 3h\\dot{\\phi}- \\frac{\\dot{\\theta}^{2}}{f^2}\\phi + v'(\\phi ) = 0,\\\\ \\label{ddottheta }   \\ddot{\\theta } + \\left ( 3h + 2 \\frac{\\dot{\\phi}}{\\phi}\\right ) \\dot{\\theta}+\\frac{f^2}{\\phi^2 } u'(\\theta ) = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the hubble parameter , dot and prime denote derivatives with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) respectively .",
    "we define @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the global structure of the dynamical system via phase plane analysis and compute the cosmological evolution by numerical analysis . introduce the following dimensionless variables :    @xmath29    and dimensionless constant @xmath30 note that @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( natural units ) and @xmath34 , so we could have @xmath35 .",

    ", we find the eigenvalues of the linear perturbation matrix , see table 2 . for stability",
    "we require the all 5 eigenvalues to be negative .",
    "the corresponding conclusions of numerical calculation are shown in fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "this numerical solutions describe heteroclinic orbits , which interpolate between an unstable critical point ( case i ) and a late - time de sitter attractor ( case iii ) .",
    "therefore , this model is more natural to explain the two stages of acceleration . a point worth emphasizing",
    "is that the ordinary matter ( radiation and dust ) affect the evolution of the scalar field via their contribution to the general expansion of the universe because of the couples can be neglected in the model . in fig.[fig1 ] , the behavior of the equation of state parameter is shown . at initial time , @xmath48 ( we choose @xmath49 , then @xmath50 ) corresponds the inflationary phase , then it increases and becomes positive . after arriving at the value @xmath51",
    ", the universe comes to the radiation dominated epoch and @xmath6 stays on a broad platform .",
    "next , @xmath6 drops to zero and stays on a narrow platform .",
    "finally , @xmath6 drops below zero and approaches to @xmath52 , which corresponds second stage of accelerated expansion .",
    "the evolution of cosmic density parameters are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the phase part contribution @xmath53 stays at @xmath54 at the very first moments of the universe and becomes @xmath45 in late - time , which plays the role of quintessence field . on the other hand , the amplitude part contribution @xmath55 plays the role of inflaton . during the whole evolution ,",
    "the radiation energy density and the dust matter energy density become dominate respectively . therefore , we see that the constraints arising from cosmological nucleosynthesis and structure formation are satisfied .",
    ".the properties of the critical points . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the cosmological implication of a complex scalar model of quintessence inflation with a barotropic fluid . using the numerical calculation for this model ,",
    "we show that the phase contribution is negligible at the early epoch of the universe while it becomes dominate with the time evolving and the evolution of the amplitude part is the opposite , which is a viable way to unify the description of the inflationary stage and the current accelerated expansion .",
    "analysis to the dynamical evolution of the complex scalar model indicates that it admits a late time attractor solution , at which the field behaves as a cosmological constant .",
    "obviously , attractor and heteroclinic orbit are both alleviate the fine tuning problem .",
