    "one in three faint high galactic latitude b stars have spectral characteristics which are indistinguishable from nearby population i b stars @xcite . assuming that these are main sequence stars , their faint apparent magnitudes imply that they are several kiloparsecs above the galactic plane .",
    "these stars most likely fall into one of three categories :    1 .",
    "`` normal '' massive population i stars ejected from the galactic disk , 2 .   misidentified",
    "older evolved stars ( i.e. blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) , post - hb , agb - manqu , or post asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) stars ) , or 3 .",
    "young massive stars formed in situ in the galactic halo .",
    "paper  i @xcite analyzed the compositions of forty apparently normal main sequence b stars , that are mostly 0.5 to 2 kiloparsecs from the galactic plane , to determine to which of those three categories each belonged .",
    "the abundances revealed : twenty two with population i abundances , nine with post - main sequence evolution , eight which could only be characterized as metal poor , and one that was unclassifiable .",
    "several of those stars which did not appear to have normal disk - like abundances also had other distinguishing characteristics including variability and/or unique emission features . combining that data with the abundances",
    ", we arrived at the following preliminary classifications :    * runaway population i stars : 21 stars are indistinguishable from nearby population i b stars , implying that they had been ejected from the disk . *",
    "old evolved stars : 10 stars have abundance patterns and characteristics which are expected in bhb , post - hb , agb - manqu , pagb , or ppn stars ( e.g. enhancement or depletion of specific elements by nuclear processing , atomic diffusion , and/or depletion of refractory elements by dust grain formation ) . *",
    "f dwarf : ag + 03 2773 appears to have been misclassified and is probably an early type f dwarf * unknown : 17 stars have insufficient or conflicting information and can not be categorized as runaway population i stars or old evolved stars .",
    "this category contains any stars that may have formed in situ in the halo .",
    "this paper analyzes the kinematics of each star and combines those results with paper  i to reclassify each star as a population i runaway , an old evolved star , or a young massive star formed in situ in the halo .",
    "refer to paper  i for a detailed description of the stellar samples and the spectra . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we review the expected kinematics for each of these stellar populations along with numerical simulations that predict the kinematic distribution of runaway stars . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss the raw data the methods used to calculate the space velocities and in section [ velocities ] we analyze those space velocities . in section",
    "[ classify ] we combine the kinematic data with the results from paper  i to make final classifications of each star and discuss the overall breakdown of the sample in section [ breaksec ] .",
    "finally , in sections [ discuss1 ] and [ discuss2 ] we analyze the properties of the stars within each category to infer more about the origins and characteristics of each stellar population .",
    "the velocities of the stars in three dimensions are calculated in the galactocentric cylindrical coordinate system ( v@xmath0 , v@xmath1 , v@xmath2 ) . in this frame of reference",
    ", v@xmath0 is radial motion relative to the galactic center with positive v@xmath0 directed away from the center of the milky way .",
    "v@xmath1 is the rotational velocity component , orthogonal to v@xmath0 in the galactic plane and positive in the direction of galactic rotation .",
    "v@xmath2 is velocity perpendicular to the galactic plane ( parallel to the spin axis of the galaxy ) , with positive v@xmath2 towards the north galactic pole ( ngp ) . in this system ,",
    "the sun is 8 kpc from galactic center and moving with a velocity of ( v@xmath0 , v@xmath1 , v@xmath2 ) = ( -9 km s@xmath3 , 232 km s@xmath3 , 7 km s@xmath3 ) , ( the solar motion is the sum of the motion of the local standard of rest ( lsr , v@xmath1 = 220 km s@xmath3 ) and the sun s own peculiar motion @xcite ) .",
    "the milky way has three main kinematic components : the bulge / bar , the disk , and the halo .",
    "none of the stars in this sample should be associated with the bulge or bar since the influence of that population is confined to within several kiloparsecs of the galactic center .",
    "any of the stars in the sample could be members of the halo but only those within about a kiloparsec from the galactic plane could be considered part of the thick disk .",
    "table [ tab61 ] shows the generally accepted velocity distributions of the thin disk , thick disk , and halo populations .",
    "the disk populations are characterized by a strong rotational component ( v@xmath1 ) with relatively small velocity dispersions .",
    "the halo population , by contrast , has much larger isotropic velocity dispersions , with no strong signature of rotation . as a result ,",
    "halo stars tend to have significantly larger v@xmath0 and v@xmath2 than most disk stars .",
    "the three categories of faint high latitude b stars belong to separate galactic populations , each with their own kinematic properties and signature .",
    "massive stars that formed in situ in the halo should have halo - like kinematics which are similar to the high - velocity clouds they formed in .",
    "low mass old evolved stars can belong to either the halo or thick disk populations .",
    "runaway population i stars occupy the same volume as the halo but retain a strong rotational component to their velocity .",
    "this makes them a kinematically unique population that combines the characteristics of both the disk and the halo .",
    "there are two mechanisms that have been proposed to launch population  i b stars from the galactic disk : the binary supernova scenario ( bss ; also called the blaauw hypothesis ) and the dynamic ejection scenario ( des ) .",
    "the binary supernova scenario ( bss ) was first proposed by @xcite and later formalized by @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the secondary star in a binary is ejected when the primary goes supernova and the system loses enough mass to become unbound .",
    "stars launched by bss are ejected with space velocities comparable to their original orbital velocity ( up to 200 km s@xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations by @xcite predict that in 20%  40% of bss ejections",
    "the neutron star produced in the supernova will remain bound to the runaway with an orbital period of several hundred days .",
    "@xcite describe an alternate mechanism where stars receive a velocity kick from close dynamic interactions between pairs of binaries or single stars and binaries .",
    "this scenario , known as the dynamic ejection scenario ( des ) , is probably most efficient in densely populated star clusters or star forming regions .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that most des encounters should produce one or more single runaway stars with velocities up to 300 km s@xmath3 .",
    "as demonstrated in appendix [ apb ] , the makeup of the galactic potential influences the trajectories and flight times of the stars in the sample .",
    "theoretically , the problem can be reversed to constrain the galactic potential using the fact that no runaway star has a flight time which exceeds its main sequence lifetime . however , in practice the uncertainty in the main sequence lifetimes is too large to constrain the potential in any meaningful way .",
    "we are also limited by the degree to which components of the potential influence individual stars .",
    "the flight times of these stars are mostly insensitive to the bulge component or changes in the scale length of the disk .",
    "then , only stars within about 1.5 kpc of the plane have any significant sensitivity to changes in the disk mass surface density .",
    "therefore , small number statistics , lack of sensitivity to changes in the potential , and uncertainty in the main sequence lifetimes conspire to make runaway b stars unsuitable as tracers for placing meaningful constraints on the galactic potential .      if we assume main sequence luminosities and distances for all the stars in the sample , then over 70% of them are between 0.5  kpc and 2  kpc from the galactic plane ( table [ resultstab ] , figure [ sampleselect ] ) .",
    "this de facto bias translates directly into a kinematic selection effect which prevents us from using the runaways to probe the range of ejection velocities imparted by bss or des .",
    "however , it is useful to us because it gives the runaways a distinct kinematic signature in their v@xmath0 and v@xmath1 space velocities ( see section [ runawaysig ] ) .",
    "runaways launched from the galactic disk follow a ballistic trajectory . as a result",
    ", they spend more time near the apex of their trajectory than traveling to or from that point .",
    "therefore , most runaways will be observed near to their maximum displacement from the galactic plane .",
    "this is why most of the runaways in our sample have relatively small v@xmath4 velocities ( table [ resultstab ] ) and are found near the theoretical apex of their orbits ( figure [ sampleselect ] ) .",
    "the maximum displacement from the plane is directly proportional to the kick which a runaway receives in the v@xmath4 direction ( z@xmath5 ) so that a volume limited sample will contain mostly stars with a given range of z@xmath5 .",
    "the parameters of this sample make it heavily biased in favor of stars with z@xmath5 between 50 km s@xmath3 and 125 km s@xmath3 ( assuming that the galactic potential matches the one in appendix [ galmod ] ) .",
    "the relationship between z@xmath5 and the total ejection velocity ( v@xmath5 ) is more complex .",
    "we computed the sample s bias in terms of v@xmath5 by monte carlo simulation using the galactic potential model in appendix [ galmod ] and the following assumptions that model the parameters of our sample :    * the stars fall between 0.5 and 2 kpc from the galactic plane * runaways are observed near the apex of their trajectory , and * there is no preferred direction for the orientation of v@xmath5 vector in space ( all angles are equally likely ) .",
    "in other words , z@xmath5/v@xmath5 is equally likely to have any value between zero and one .",
    "the results of the simulation are not sensitive to the upper bound of the first assumption .",
    "stars reaching a maximum height of 3 kpc or 4 kpc have z@xmath5s which are 41 km s@xmath3 and 79 km s@xmath3 faster than those reaching 2 kpc ( figure [ sampleselect ] ) .",
    "this has only a slight affect on the high velocity tail of the distribution .",
    "the second assumption is merely , as explained above , an application of kepler s second law .",
    "figure [ sampleselect ] confirms that the runaways in the sample are found near the apex of their trajectories .    the computed bias in terms of total ejection velocity is presented in figure [ selectionsimfig ] along with the distribution of ejection velocities for the runaways in our sample ( see section [ zej ] ) .",
    "the sample bias is the dominate factor shaping the distribution of ejection velocities .",
    "a sharp cutoff occurs between 50 km s@xmath3 and 100 km s@xmath3 because stars ejected with v@xmath5 smaller than 50 km s@xmath3 are unable to reach a height of 0.5 kpc from the plane even if all their velocity is directed in the v@xmath4 direction .",
    "given this overwhelming bias , we must conclude that this sample can not provide any useful information with respect to the distribution of z@xmath5 or v@xmath5 .",
    "future studies which intend to measure the distribution of ejection velocities must sample many more runaway stars over a wider range of distances ( i.e. 0.1 to 5 kpc ) from the galactic plane .      while the sample bias is crippling with respect to the distribution of z@xmath5 and v@xmath5 , it can be used to identify the runaways in the sample by their space velocities .",
    "the remainder of v@xmath5 that is not in z@xmath5 is distributed between the v@xmath0 and v@xmath1 components . because the runaways are ejected from the thin disk population",
    ", their v@xmath0 and v@xmath1 velocities will be the sum of their ejection velocities and the rotation of the rest frame in the galactic disk that they were launched from . as a result",
    ", a plot of v@xmath0 versus v@xmath1 for runaway stars should be centered on the lsr ( v@xmath0= 0 km s@xmath3 ; v@xmath1= 220 km s@xmath3 ) and kinematically heated to a degree directly influenced by the distribution of ejection velocities present in the sample .",
    "this distribution contrasts with halo stars , which should have no strong v@xmath1 component and larger v@xmath0 components on average .",
    "we ran a monte carlo simulation of v@xmath0 and v@xmath1 velocities of runaway stars using the galactic potential model described in appendix [ galmod ] and the following parameters :    1 .",
    "the runaways in the sample originate in the galactic thin disk within 1.0 kpc of the sun .",
    "( see below ) 2 .",
    "the maximum total ejection velocity of a runaway is 400 km s@xmath3 .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite ) 3 .",
    "the portion of the total ejection velocity for a runaway which is not in z@xmath5 is randomly distributed between the v@xmath0 and v@xmath1 components , with the initial pre - ejection velocity equal to the lsr ( v@xmath0= 0 km s@xmath3 ; v@xmath1= 220 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "runaways are observed at the apex of their trajectories .",
    "( kepler s second law ) 5 .",
    "runaways included in the simulation have trajectories with maximum heights of 0.5 kpc to 2 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "( see section [ runawaybias ] ) 6 .",
    "the position of a runaway at its maximum displacement from the galactic plane is at least 30 degrees above the galactic plane as viewed from the sun .",
    "( see the sample selection criteria in paper  i )    the results of the simulation are presented in figure [ vpvtsim ] .",
    "note that nearly all the runaway stars fall within 100 km s@xmath3 of the lsr .",
    "the fuzzy diagonal structure to the lower left of the lsr can be explained by the behavior of a particle in a keplarian potential .",
    "an orbiting object which receives a kick slowing its orbital velocity ( decreased v@xmath1 ) will move radially inward ( negative v@xmath0 ) while an object receiving a kick increasing its orbital velocity ( increased v@xmath1 ) will move radially outward ( positive v@xmath0 ) .",
    "this creates a noticeable diagonal pattern in the velocity field .",
    "while the galactic potential is not keplarian , it is reasonably approximated as such for the purpose of this argument .",
    "the second assumption further negates the significance of the upper bound in the fifth assumption .",
    "if more of a star s v@xmath5 is partitioned into z@xmath5 ( to make it go further from the plane ) then there is less velocity to distribute into the v@xmath1 and v@xmath0 velocity components .",
    "this makes a _",
    "tighter _ and more centrally concentrated velocity distribution about the lsr in the v@xmath1 versus v@xmath0 plane .",
    "the first assumption in the simulation also has little effect on the outcome .",
    "if we assume that the runaways have originated in or near discrete local star forming regions instead , the general size and shape of the velocity distribution remains the same ( figure [ regionsims ] ) .",
    "there are some subtle differences between the distributions which are dependent on the distance and location of each star forming region relative to the sun .",
    "however , these differences are small in relation to the typical observational errors associated with the stellar velocities measured in this study and it took thousands of points in the monte carlo simulation to make the differences between these patterns noticeable .",
    "the full space velocities of the stars are computed using the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the input parameters to this algorithm include : distance , proper motion , and radial velocity .",
    "the errors in the velocities were estimated from the errors of the input parameters using a monte carlo technique . the largest contribution to the errors",
    "is from the proper motions because they are multiplied by the distance and usually have errors that are a significant fraction of their value .",
    "uncertainty in the other factors also contributes to the over - all errors but to a lesser degree .    for diagnostic purposes our first assessment of each star s velocity",
    "is made assuming that it is a main sequence star . in doing so ,",
    "we purposefully over estimated the distances and space velocities of the less intrinsically luminous evolved stars in the sample .",
    "that fact is used to distinguish them from the population i runaways and in section [ bhbvel ] we will revisit the velocities of the less massive and luminous stars using more appropriate assumptions .",
    "every star in the study has proper motions from the hipparcos catalog ( hip ) @xcite , the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , and at least one other catalog including : the act @xcite , the carlsberg meridian catalogs ( cmc ) @xcite , and the first u.s .",
    "naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac1 ) @xcite .",
    "three or more independent proper motion measures for each star were combined by weighted average as described in @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the errors of the average proper motions are a factor of 1.5 to 2.0 smaller than the errors in the hipparcos catalog ( table [ inputtab ] ) .",
    "as noted above , the distances to the stars in the sample of study are first determined by photometric parallax assuming that all the stars have main sequence luminosities .",
    "blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars are significantly less luminous than main sequence b stars with the same effective temperature .",
    "therefore the distance to a bhb star will be overestimated if the intrinsic luminosity of a main sequence star is used to calculate its photometric parallax .",
    "an overestimated distance will in turn inflate the space velocity for a star so that a sub - luminous star which is a member of the thick or thin disk population may kinematically appear to be a member of the halo . in the most extreme cases ,",
    "an overestimated distance can even result in velocities that appear to exceed the galaxy s escape velocity in the solar neighborhood ( at least 500 km s@xmath3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "due to their sub - luminous nature , bhb stars in the sample are not several kiloparsecs above the plane , but actually only a few hundred parsecs away .",
    "assigning these stars main sequence distances will help to kinematically separate them from the rest of the sample .",
    "we will revisit them in section [ bhbvel ] to evaluate their `` true '' space velocities with more reasonable assumptions about their intrinsic luminosities and distances .",
    "absolute johnson v magnitudes were calculated for each star from the bolometric magnitudes and bolometric corrections .",
    "the bolometric magnitudes were determined by matching the effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity of each star the models of @xcite .",
    "the bolometric corrections were interpolated using the same parameters from a grid of models computed with atlas12 @xcite .",
    "we compared the absolute magnitudes from this method with those calculated by the method of @xcite for the stars in our sample with geneva photometry ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the @xcite relation was calibrated using hipparcos parallaxes to obtain the distances and intrinsic luminosities of stars fitted as a function of the geneva reddening free x and y color indices @xcite .",
    "there are fewer stars with hipparcos parallaxes to calibrate the hot end of the relation ( t@xmath6 @xmath7 30000  k ) so one must be cautious applying this relation in that regime .",
    "this method is also only valid for stars with effective temperatures hotter than 11000  k because it uses the x and y indices .",
    "there is a trend in the difference between the absolute magnitudes calculated by our method and the method of cramer with respect to the geneva y index ( figure [ genevay ] ) .",
    "the outliers from the main group in that diagram are stars which are obviously not main sequence stars that lie outside the normal regime of the cramer relation .",
    "the geneva y index is a measure of a b star s separation from the main sequence @xcite .",
    "therefore the trend in y suggests that the cramer relation does not completely account for changes in brightness as a star evolves away from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "the cramer relation was developed from the limited number of b stars with measurable hipparcos parallaxes so it is afflicted by small number statistics and strongly biases by galactic structures such as gould s belt .",
    "many of the stars in this sample are at least several tens of myr evolved from the zams ( as evidenced from their flight times , see section [ zej ] ) so that evolution has had a significant effect on their absolute luminosity .",
    "the cramer relation has an internal formal error of 0.44 mag which corresponds roughly to a factor of 20% in distance . considering our sources of error , those of @xcite , and the random spread in our comparison with the @xcite relation , the photometric distances are assigned a @xmath830% error ( 0.57 magnitudes ) .",
    "hd  138503 is an eclipsing binary composed of two main sequence b stars that was analyzed by @xcite . from that work",
    ", a distance of 2.4  kpc is adopted with an error of @xmath9 .",
    "this distance is significantly greater than the distance derived from our method described above ( @xmath10 kpc ) .",
    "however this discrepancy is explained by hd  138503 s binary nature which makes the pair more luminous together than a single star at the same distance .    in paper",
    "i , we showed that ag  + 03  2773 is probably a rapidly rotating f  dwarf . to calculate its distance we assumed an effective temperature of 7000  k with a surface gravity of 4.0 and roughly solar composition .",
    "this yielded a distance of 400 pc which is consistent with its hipparcos parallax ( 0.23@xmath82.05 ) .",
    "radial velocities were measured for forty ( 41 ) of the stars in the sample . the high resolution ( r=60000 )",
    "spectra taken for the abundance analysis were used to measure the radial velocities of the stars from the doppler shift of their photospheric absorption lines .",
    "( for a detailed description of the spectra see section 2.1 in paper  i. ) the resolution of the spectrograph ( one resolution unit equals two pixels ) is about 2 km s@xmath3 but the fft interpolates four points to each pixel allowing an even higher precision to be achieved .",
    "the precision of the radial velocities is primarily influenced by our capability to determine the line center .",
    "this becomes more difficult with an increase in rotational broadening .",
    "the process of measuring the wavelengths of line centers was interactive .",
    "lines that appeared to be blended or had no clear minimum in the profile were excluded from the analysis .",
    "the line centers are defined by the minima in the line profiles in the continuum corrected fft filtered data .",
    "high rotational broadening and low signal to noise sometimes drastically limited the number of lines that could be measured in a spectrum . in a three desperate cases ( hd 15910 , hip  12320 , and hd  106929 ) , where no other lines could be measured with confidence ,",
    "only the hydrogen balmer lines were used to determine the radial velocity of the star . because the spectral orders have some wavelength overlap , several lines were measured on two adjacent spectral orders .",
    "each of these were treated as independent measures when computing the average value .",
    "the average radial velocity for a spectral observation is calculated as a straight unweighted average of the values from each of the observed lines .",
    "since the distribution of individual measurements is roughly gaussian , the error of that average is estimated from the standard deviation of the measurements .",
    "the iraf procedure noao.rv.rvcorrect was used to transform the observed radial velocities into the heliocentric reference frame using the date and time at mid - exposure . for spectra that consisted of combined exposure sets from several nights , the correction factor was not significantly different for each exposure set and an average value was used .",
    "radial velocity standards from @xcite were used to verify the measured radial velocities .",
    "table [ stdrvtab ] shows that this method is able to accurately reproduce the radial velocities of the standard stars .",
    "there is good agreement between most of the radial velocities we measured ( table [ inputtab ] ) and those published in the literature ( table [ rvcomp ] ) . later in section [ binaries ]",
    "we will discuss if any of the discrepancies in table [ rvcomp ] imply that some of these stars are binaries .",
    "the radial velocities of ten stars were taken from the literature for the following reasons :    * no spectra were obtained for six stars in the sample . *",
    "hd  140543 has irregularly shaped lines that proved difficult to measure with any confidence . * the systemic velocity of bd  + 13 3224 could not be determined with any confidence because the lines were smeared ( the exposures were too long compared to the very short period of this pulsating helium dwarf ) .",
    "* hd  135569 is a long period binary so we relied on the analysis of @xcite for the systemic velocity . * the systematic radial velocity of eclipsing binary hd  13503 ( it lib )",
    "was analyzed separately by @xcite .",
    "the projected main sequence lifetimes ( t@xmath11 ) for the stars in the sample were determined from their effective temperature , surface gravity , and metal content from the tables of @xcite .",
    "if the metallicity of the star is not know , the longest main sequence lifetime for any metallicity is used .",
    "the results for each star are listed in table [ resultstab ] .",
    "the error in the main sequence lifetime is difficult to estimate since stellar rotation and other mixing can affect the hydrogen burning lifetime of a massive star by as much as 30% @xcite .",
    "other processes ( i.e. convection , overshooting , and semiconvection ) are only roughly modeled and magnetic fields are completely ignored , affording significant additional uncertainty @xcite . considering these factors and the uncertainty of converting the effective temperatures and metallicities to main sequence lifetimes ,",
    "we have adopted an error of @xmath850% for the estimated main sequence lifetimes .",
    "the error could be larger than this for the highest mass stars ( shortest main sequence lifetimes ) .",
    "initial ejection velocities perpendicular to the plane ( z@xmath5 ) and travel times back to the disk ( t@xmath12 ) are computed from the full space velocities of each star ( assuming main sequence distances ) using a model of the galactic potential and an orbital integrator outlined in appendix [ galmod ] and described in detail by @xcite .",

    "the v@xmath4 for twenty two of the stars is under 50 km s@xmath3 .",

    "a question mark ( ? ) after the classification denotes some uncertainty due to missing or conflicting data .",

    "there are a number of differences between bhb and post - hb stars :    * the atmospheres of bhb stars are dominated by the affects of atomic diffusion @xcite and polluted by the products of partial cno burning while post - hb stars can have much more complicated abundance patterns involving more advanced nuclear process and dust formation since they are more evolved .",

    "use radial velocities alone while @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and our own study examined the full space velocities . note that @xcite and @xcite are part of a comprehensive survey , while @xcite and @xcite are randomly selected samples .",

    "there is remarkable agreement between our study and @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the general consensus appears to be that about two thirds of all high galactic latitude b stars are high mass population i runaways , while the remaining third are low mass older evolved stars .",
    "the fraction of runaways with binary companions depends on the ejection mechanism which accelerated them .",
    "simulations predict that 10% of stars ejected by des are binary@xcite .",

    "therefore , a significant number of bss runaways should be single - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb1s ) with periods on the order of a few hundred days @xcite .",
    "almost all of the stars in this sample were observed at least twice over the course of a few days so the radial velocity measurements are sensitive to variations in short period binaries .",
    "the level of sensitivity is comparable to the errors given for the radial velocity in table [ inputtab ] .",
    "they ranged from 2 km s@xmath3  15 km s@xmath3 depending on the number of lines measured and the vsin(i ) of the star .",
    "we detected the eclipsing binary hd  138503 @xcite but found no other short period binaries in our sample .",
    "hd  138503 was probably produced by des since it is an sb2 composed of two main sequence stars .    in the case of five old evolved stars ( hd  21305 , hd  40267 , hip  41979 , hd  237844 , and hd  137569 ) and seven runaways ( hd  21532 , bd  + 61  996 , hd  103376 , bd  + 30  2355",

    "we detected none except the known binary old evolved star hd  137569 .",
    "finally , we compared the measured radial velocities with the literature ( table [ rvcomp ] ) .",
    "five runaways have radial velocities which differ from their literature values by more than two sigma : hd  15910 , feige  40 , hd  110166 , hd  188618 , and hd  216135 .",
    "the radial velocities for hd  15190 , feige  40 , and hd  110166 have very large errors so any discrepancy has a lower significance .",
    "hd  188618 and hd  216135 disagree rather significantly with previously published values .",
    "they are the best candidate sb1s in our sample .",
    "we are unable to verify that any of these are binaries .",
    "the binary frequency observed by @xcite predicts about three binaries in a sample of 28 runaways .",
    "we found hd  138503 plus two promising candidates .",
    "furthermore , those two promising candidates are most likely long period sb1s of the type expected for stars ejected by bss@xcite . however ,",
    "neither show any evidence that their photosphere was polluted by supernova ejecta ( see paper  i ) .",
    "our results , taken by themselves , are not significant .",
    "however , a number of more extensive surveys have determined that fewer than 10% of early type high latitude runaways have binary companions @xcite .",
    "that binary frequency is more consistent with simulations of des than bss .",
    "the rotational velocity distribution for high latitude b stars is roughly the same as nearby b stars in the field ( figure [ hlbrotdist ] ) with a slightly larger proportion of slow rotating stars since these samples include bhb stars@xcite .",
    "other studies have biased their selection of runaway stars by using stellar rotation as a criterion to distinguish between bhb stars and `` normal '' population i stars ( i.e. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "but we have not .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between the stars with small vsin(i ) and the main sequence or horizontal branch ( figure [ slowrot ] ) .",
    "there are four slow vsin(i ) stars clustered alone in the upper left corner of that diagram",
    ". however , three of those ( hd  123844 , hd  137569 , and hip  1511 ) are clearly oes based on their abundances and space velocities . because the runaway star sample is selected without regard for projected rotational velocity ( vsin(i ) ) we are able to measure the unbiased rotational velocity distribution of runaway b stars .",
    "surprisingly , when the older evolved stars are removed from the distribution ( figure [ hlbrotdist ] , panel b ) there is a clear deficit of slow rotating stars compared to the field .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the field star samples of @xcite and @xcite are contaminated by slow rotating old evolved stars because both are drawn from main sequence b stars in the yale bright star catalog @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the field stars have the same distribution as `` older '' ob associations , which are not old enough to contain any post - main sequence bhb or post - hb stars .",
    "our runaway star distribution appears to be more like the `` youngest '' population i b stars from @xcite ( figure [ guthrie ] ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite shows that there is a 50% probability that our runaway sample was drawn from guthrie s `` young '' sub - group versus a 30% chance that it was drawn from guthrie s field star sample 180 km s@xmath3 increases the significance of the match with guthrie s `` young '' sub - group to over 80% with no change to the much lower probability of association with guthrie s field sample . ] .",
    "guthrie s `` young '' ob associations were selected for their high stellar density and @xcite and @xcite have shown that denser star forming regions contain significantly fewer slow rotating stars .",
    "when one considers that dynamical ejection ( des ) is more efficient in denser stellar environments , the implication is that most of the stars in our sample could have come from these tightly packed ob associations .",
    "the bss mechanism involves the ejection of a secondary from a close binary when the primary goes supernova . in the case of a close binary system",
    "there will be tidal locking , so that the rotation rate of the runaway will be directly related to its original orbital velocity .",
    "it is possible that the combination of the bias in our sample ( which sharply excludes the smallest ejection velocities , see section [ runawaybias ] ) and pre - ejection bss tidal locking could produce a sample like ours with few slow rotators .",
    "however if bss is the dominate mechanism at work in our sample , there should be a linear relationship between ejection velocity and vsin(i ) because the ejection velocity should be comparable to the orbital velocity when the system becomes unbound .",
    "there is clearly no trace of any relationship between rotation and ejection velocity in our sample ( figure [ rotvsvej ] ) .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that bss is the dominate mechanism which produced these runaways .    on the other hand ,",
    "des is much more efficient in densely populated environments ( like guthrie s `` young '' ob associations ) since it accelerates runaway stars through random dynamic interactions between stars or pairs of stars . because the distribution of vsin(i ) for our sample so closely matches guthrie s `` young '' sub - groups it seems likely that des is the dominate mechanism in our runaway sample .",
    "@xcite appears to contradict this notion by concluding that about two - thirds of massive runaways are produced by bss .",
    "however , they surveyed a subset of stars within 700 pc of the sun with space velocities up to 115 km s@xmath3 that are mostly excluded from our sample .",
    "it is possible that these are a sub - population with different properties from the high latitude runaway b stars .",
    "their classification scheme also assumed that bss would produce runaways with larger rotational velocities and with flight times shorter than the estimated age of their `` parent groups . ''",
    "the former assumption was made without the benefit of the work of @xcite or the findings that we have reported here .",
    "the later neglects that des can still occur in dense clusters as they age and expand , albeit at a lower rate .",
    "if we assume that the frequency of be stars is the same as reported by @xcite for the nearby field , this sample should have at least ten be stars out of the 48 high latitude b stars in our sample",
    ". however , there are no classical be stars in our sample .",
    "this result is rather significant even considering that the number of be stars will always be under - counted by a survey of this type .",
    "( be emission is a transient phenomenon that can be missed by surveys with short temporal baselines . )",
    "two surveys have identified runaway be stars at smaller distances from the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite identified 8 runaway be stars between 0.20.9 kpc from the plane which barely overlaps the volume occupied by most of our sample and contains mostly runaways that would have been ejected with v@xmath5 too low to be included in our sample . likewise , @xcite found 3%7% of the be stars in the hipparcos catalog have runaway space velocities .",
    "however those velocities ranged from 40 km s@xmath3  102 km s@xmath3 which would have only a small overlap with our sample .",
    "both these studies imply that the incidence of be stars among runaways is lower than measured in the field .    a population of b stars which do not exhibit the be phenomenon could prove invaluable for identifying the critical factors involved .",
    "obviously , fast rotation alone does not create be stars since on average most runaways rotate faster than b stars found in the field ( see section [ runawayrot ] ) .",
    "@xcite conjectured that mass transfer during the post main sequence phase of a binary system prior to bss might play a role in the be phenomenon .",
    "there is a low incidence among runaways of binaries that could transfer mass at critical times ( see section [ binaries ] ) .",
    "however , it appears that most of these stars were ejected by des . by process of elimination",
    ", it remains that this could somehow be tied to the small number of binaries or the origin of the runaways in dense star clusters with some mechanism selecting against the be phenomenon there .",
    "@xcite found no correlation between the number of be stars and stellar density in galactic star clusters .",
    "but they did find a smaller frequency of be stars ( 2%7% ) in clusters than reported in the field by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they give three reasons for this discrepancy :    1 .",
    "magnitude limited field samples are biased in favor of early type b stars in gould s belt and early spectral types have a higher be frequency .",
    "gould s belt is also a population that has a higher frequency of be stars due to its age .",
    "mcswain & gies made one - shot observations of their clusters which tend to underestimate the actual number of be stars .",
    "however , the fact remains that @xcite also found a lower incidence of be stars among runaways than in the field . also like @xcite",
    ", we do not have a long baseline of data which will catch temporarily inactive be stars .",
    "if , as implied by the vsin(i ) distribution , the runaways are ejected mainly from cluster environments and we assume be stars are produced in the smaller proportions measured by @xcite or @xcite , then it is much more likely that our sample of 49 stars with 31 population i runaways would not contain any be stars .",
    "the distances and space velocities of the low mass evolved stars in the sample were initially exaggerated by estimating their photometric parallax from a main sequence luminosity ( see section [ sublum ] ) .",
    "now that the bhb stars are identified , their photometric parallax and space velocities can be recalculated using more appropriate absolute magnitudes from the evolutionary tracks of @xcite for the appropriate effective temperatures , surface gravities , and metallicities ( table [ bhbkin ] ) and the bolometric corrections calculated by atlas12 .",
    "hd  21305 has a very small proper motion so a factor of five change in its distance has very little effect on its space velocity .",
    "however , the space velocities of hip  1511 , hip  41979 , pb  166 , and hd  222040 are markedly different .",
    "the revised space velocities for these stars are much more reasonable than those listed in table [ resultstab ] .",
    "it is easy to chemically and kinematically assign hip  1511 and hd  222040 membership in the halo population and likewise assign hd  21305 membership in the thick disk population .",
    "hip  41979 and pb  166 have abundances which are consistent with the thick disk but their revised v@xmath0 and v@xmath4 do not comfortably fit in the expected velocity distribution for the thick disk population ( table [ tab61 ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the distances and the proper motions have significant influence over v@xmath0 and v@xmath4 for both stars .",
    "based only on v@xmath1 it seems likely that both are members of the thick disk population .",
    "we also recalculated the distances and space velocities of the post - hb and `` ambiguous '' evolved stars using the dorman et al .",

    "the space velocity of hd  21305 indicates that it is probably a member of the galactic thick disk population regardless of its evolutionary state ( see section [ bhbvel ] ) .",
    "therefore , its bhb classification is made entirely based on its abundance pattern and hence , is less certain than the other two metal - rich bhb stars .",
    "we have sorted the high galactic latitude stars in our sample into five groups : population i runaways ( 31 stars ) , bhb stars ( 5 stars ) , post - hb stars ( 3 stars ) , old evolved stars of ambiguous classification ( 6 stars ) , and those that we can not classify ( 2 stars ) .",
    "the two unclassified stars are probably extreme population i runaways .",
    "we agree with other studies that roughly two thirds of faint high galactic latitude b stars are population i runaways ejected from the galactic disk .",
    "the remainder are older evolved post - main sequence stars .",
    "no star in this sample ( or any other we are aware of ) shows metal poor abundances and halo - like kinematics of a young massive star which formed in situ in the galactic halo .",
    "hd  237840 and hd  233622 are classified as old evolved stars based on their abundances .",
    "however they are rotating far too rapidly to be low mass stars .",
    "they could be chemically odd population i runaways or main sequence stars formed in situ in the halo but there is not enough evidence to justify either alternative .",
    "the population i runaways have a number of interesting properties :    * a low incidence of binaries ( less than 10% as shown in other studies ) . *",
    "a deficit of slow rotators ( vsin(i ) @xmath17 50 km s@xmath3 ) compared to the field .",
    "* no be stars .",
    "no significant shift was measured in the radial velocities of the 31 runaways in the sample over baselines of a few days or months except for hd  137569 and the eclipsing binary hd  138503 ( it lib ) . that binary was probably launched by des since it is an sb2 comprised of two normal main sequence stars .",
    "two stars ( hd  188618 and hd  216135 ) have discrepancies between their measured radial velocities and those reported in the literature .",
    "these could be single - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb1s ) with neutron star companions produced by bss with periods on the order of several hundred days .",
    "these results are not significant by themselves but they are consistent with more extensive studies which show that the binary frequency among early type runaways is less than 10% .",
    "this relative lack of runaway binaries implies that des is the dominant mechanism . the projected rotational velocity ( vsin(i ) )",
    "distribution also supports this hypothesis .",
    "the rotation of population i runaways are like densely populated star clusters in that they have fewer slow rotators than the field population .",
    "therefore , we conclude that most of the runaways originate in dense clusters or star forming regions .",
    "this supports the des hypothesis since it is much more efficient in dense stellar environments .",
    "there is also no correlation between ejection velocity ( v@xmath5 ) and vsin(i ) , as would be expected for a bss dominated sample .",
    "together , the low frequency of binaries and the lack of slow rotators provide a compelling argument that des is the dominant ejection mechanism for runaway b stars .",
    "this is not to say that bss does not contribute at some level .",
    "hd  188618 and hd  215135 could be long period sb1s of the type produced by bss .",
    "however , it appears that runaways accelerated by des dominate this sample .",
    "the absence of be stars from the sample presents another interesting facet .",
    "this could be due to an observational bias either on our part or affecting field star samples .",
    "but it could also potentially be due to some mechanism responsible for the be phenomenon that runaways do not possess .",
    "the lack of binary companions , something about the ejection mechanism , or another factor in the cluster environment which they were ejected from may leave runaways without crucial ingredients necessary to become be stars .",
    "further study of runaways could help unlock the mystery of the be phenomenon .",
    "the old evolved stars also exhibit interesting characteristics .",
    "the velocities of the bhb stars determine their membership in either the thick disk or halo populations .",
    "we confirmed that pb  166 and hip  41979 are nearby solar - metallicity bhb stars which belong to the thick disk .",
    "there is still some uncertainty about hd  21305 which has a pattern of abundances like the other two and kinematically belongs to the thick disk .",
    "however its log(g ) and t@xmath6 place it well away from the tahb .",

    "the orbital integrator we use is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the milky way s potential was simulated following the prescription of @xcite using a three component model which combines : ( 1 ) a @xcite disk potential , ( 2 ) a @xcite spheroidal potential , ( 3 ) and a logarithmic dark halo potential .",
    "the parameters for each of the components are selected so that together they reproduce the observed rotation curve of the milky way s disk ( table [ tab66 ] ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite have used the same model and parameters to successfully simulate the motions of stars in the galactic halo .",
    "this model and integrator also reasonably reproduce the results of @xcite from their data ( table [ tab67 ] ) within the margin of error we would expect since they use a different galactic potential model .",
    "the parameters of the galactic potential model affect the flight times of runaways from the galactic plane .",
    "the disk component of the model provides most of the restoring force that governs the ballistic trajectories calculated for each star .",
    "therefore , it is a matter of concern that the mass surface density of the galactic disk we have adopted in our model for this study ( @xmath18 = 95 m@xmath19 pc@xmath20 ) is more than twice the local mass surface density of the disk alone ( @xmath18 = 48@xmath89 m@xmath19 pc@xmath20 , @xcite ; @xmath18 = 56@xmath86 m@xmath19 pc@xmath20 , @xcite ) and about four thirds the total integrated mass density within 1.1 kpc of the galactic plane ( @xmath18 = 71@xmath86 m@xmath19 pc@xmath20,@xcite ; @xmath18 = 74@xmath86 m@xmath19 pc@xmath20,@xcite ) .    in simple terms ,",
    "a decrease in @xmath18 should produce a proportional increase in the flight times of the stars in the sample . a smaller @xmath18 translates into a smaller restoring force for stars displaced from the galactic plane , allowing runaway stars with a given ejection velocity to travel further from the disk .",
    "this means that stars would travel at lower velocities to reach the same positions , lengthening their flight times .",
    "the disk potential is embedded in the larger halo potential , so stars that journey beyond the immediate influence of the disk would be less effected by changes in @xmath18 . for this reason , this effect should be greater for stars nearer to the disk moving with slower initial ejection velocities than for stars with higher initial ejection velocities further from the plane .",
    "the adopted potential model ( table [ tab66 ] ) relies on a balance between its three components in order to reproduce the observed rotation curve of the galactic disk .",
    "therefore , a complete reformulation of the model is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "however , a simple reassessment gives an reliable estimate of the effect that a lower @xmath18 might have on the calculated flight times . in a simple - minded way , we lowered @xmath18 by altering the parameters for the disk component and then adjusted the bulge and halo components to flatten the galactic rotation curve as near to 210 km s@xmath3 as possible between 5 kpc and and 20 kpc from the galactic center . in three of the models",
    "@xmath18 was altered by changing the total mass of the disk ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "however a fourth model label `` short disk '' was produced by adopting a shorter disk scale length favored by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the parameters for each model are given in table [ tab69 ] .",
    "the flight times were recalculated for each star in the sample using the alternate models .",
    "figure [ difmods ] shows the effect of each model on the calculated flight times versus distance of the star from the galactic plane .",
    "the no bulge model is identical to the original model except that it has no bulge component .",
    "panel a confirms that the bulge component has no significant effect on the calculated flight times .",
    "the results from the short disk model ( panel e ) are similar to the 0.50 disk model ( panel b ) which has the same @xmath18 .",
    "this leads us to conclude that the flight times are not very sensitive to the disk scale length except through its influence on @xmath18 .",
    "panels b through d demonstrate that reducing @xmath18 lengthens the flight times for stars in the sample .",
    "the transition between stars dominated by the disk and the halo occurs at about 1.5 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "the flight times for stars more than 1.5 kpc from the galactic plane are at most ten to fifteen percent larger while stars that are within 1.5 kpc of the disk have much larger differences in calculated flight times dependent on @xmath18 .    the differences in travel time between the original model and the 0.5 disk model ( b ) affect the relationship between each star s flight time and main sequence lifetime ( figure [ msvstd2 ] ) .",
    "fortunately , most stars remain within the same region defined by the dotted lines if @xmath18 is halved .",
