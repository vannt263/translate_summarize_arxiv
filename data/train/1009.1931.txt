    "the importance of etgs in the context of galaxy formation rests on their evolved nature that makes them the fossil evidence of the process of galaxy evolution .",

    "this raises the issue of how significant galaxy re - processing has been during the hubble time , in particular at low redshift ( i.e. in the range 0@xmath101 ) where @xmath11cdm hierarchical models predict that most of the etg stellar mass was assembled @xcite",
    ".    the study of the stellar populations in nearby galaxies allows us to trace back with cosmic time the evolutionary history of galaxies .",
    "some recent studies paint a surprising picture for the evolution of etgs showing that the environment plays a key role in their evolution . from the study of a sample of 124 galaxies , @xcite find that massive etgs in low density environments ( ldes ) are on average @xmath122 gyr younger and slightly ( @xmath120.05 - 0.1 dex ) more metal rich than their counterparts in high density environments . similarly , the study of @xcite , based on a sample of @xmath1314000 etgs from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , suggests that etgs in dense environments are @xmath1220% older than those in ldes . on the other hand",
    ", the environment does not affect @xmath7-elements enhancement .",
    "these results , obtained from the analysis of optical spectra , suggest that the evolutionary process is similar in the cluster and in the field but occurred earlier in more dense environments .",

    "@xcite concluded that etgs in low density environments are less likely to present weak episodes of recent star formation than their high - density counterparts .",
    "_ galex _ studies of etgs with shell structures are of particular relevance , since these features , believed to be ` bona fide ' signatures of recent accretion / merging events , characterize a significant fraction ( @xmath1316.5% ) of field etgs @xcite",

    "similar results have been recently obtained by @xcite for a sauron galaxy sample .",
    "they determined the uv fundamental plane and suggested that the dominant fraction of the tilt and the scatter of this plane is due to the presence of young stars in preferentially low mass etgs .",

    "our program considers 65 etgs mainly located in groups and low density environments ( ldes ) . in paper iii",
    ", we showed that the etgs of our sample have a large age spread , with luminosity - weighted ages ranging from  1 gyr to a hubble time .",
    "luminosity - weighted ages younger than  5 gyr are always associated with the galaxies residing in the lowest density environments .",
    "we suggest that such young ages are due to ` rejuvenation ' episodes , which do not involve more than 25% of the total galaxy stellar mass . in paper iv we investigated the nature of the ionization mechanism through standard emission - line diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. log [ oiii]/h@xmath17 vs. log [ nii]/h@xmath7 ) .",
    "the majority of our etgs are classified as liners .",
    "galaxies classified as seyferts in our sample tend to have very young ( @xmath185 gyr ) mean ages , supporting that star formation and agn phenomena co - exist ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the gas oxygen abundance , derived through the emission lines , gives systematically lower values than that of stars .",
    "a possible explanation is that the gas has an external origin , e.g. derived from the accretion of a metal poorer companion .",
    "we present in this paper galex fuv and nuv surface photometry of 40 etgs .",
    "the uv wavelengths are particularly sensitive to young populations , and thus ideal to characterize any recent star formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",

    "a sample of 40 galaxies is selected from a wider sample of 65 etgs ( see paper  i and ii ) . table  [ tab1 ] reports the main properties of the sample .",

    "they provide relations ( their equation 7 and 10 ) which allow a direct transformation from the measured velocity dispersion to galaxy mass . according to the above formulae , the quoted velocity dispersion ,",
    "that ranges from @xmath13130 to 340 km  s@xmath21 , indicate that our galaxies cover a large range in masses ( roughly 3 @xmath24 10@xmath25 - 9 @xmath24 10@xmath26 m@xmath27 ) .",

    "a definite trend of increasing metallicity ( column 9 ) and [ @xmath7/fe ] ( column 10 ) with the velocity dispersion is observed , testifying that the chemical enrichment was more efficient and the duration of the star formation shorter in more massive galaxies .",
    "these two relations do not depend on the galaxy morphological type .",
    "nebular emission lines are commonly found in the inner regions of etgs : in the optical , the fractions of documented detection in different samples are 55%-60% @xcite , 72% ( ellipticals , e ) -85% ( lenticulars , s0 ) @xcite ,",
    "66%(e ) -83% ( s0 ) @xcite , and 52% @xcite . concerning a possible environmental effect on the presence of emission lines in etgs , @xcite , in a sample of 62 etgs in low density environments , found that 44% of the luminous etgs ( m@xmath2917 ) are detected in hi ( i.e. 10 times more frequently than in the virgo cluster ) , 60% of which show emission line ratios typical of star - forming galaxies .",

    "the richness of the environment in which our etgs are located is well described by the parameter @xmath31 ( column 12 of table 1 ) provided by @xcite in the _ nearby galaxy catalog_. it represents the density of galaxies brighter than b=@xmath816 mag in the vicinity of each galaxy in mpc@xmath32 .",

    "additional _ galex _ observations with exposure times of about 100 seconds exist for the following sub - set of the paper  i plus paper  ii samples : ngc  1947 , ngc  5193 , ngc  6721 , ngc  6758 , ngc  7007 and ngc  7377 but were not considered in the present paper , in order to have an homogeneous flux limit .",

    "we stress that , while the uv colour profiles may extend out to several optical effective radii , the ages , metallicities and @xmath7-enhancements , derived in paper  iii , refer to apertures whose radius is only a fraction of r@xmath23 .    in the upper panels of figure",
    "[ fig5 ] the ( fuv - nuv ) colour profiles of galaxies with a age lower than 4 gyr are shown in the left panel and of galaxies older than 10 gyr in the right panel , using age estimates from paper  iii ( see table  1 ) .",
    "mean ages younger than 4 gyr are likely due to recent star formation episodes superimposed on an old stellar population .",
    "we exclude from these panels etgs with rings which we collect in the bottom right panel .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] clearly shows that the ( fuv - nuv ) colour tends to become progressively redder from the centre outwards .",
    "this trend is consistent with the stellar populations becoming progressively more metal poor or younger ( or a combination of both ) with increasing distance from the galaxy centre .",
    "in fact , the nuv light is dominated by turnoff stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the fuv emission of old ` normal ' stellar populations is dominated by pagb stars .",
    "as a population gets younger or more metal poor , the turnoff becomes bluer and more luminous , and emits more in the nuv ; at the same time , the contribution to the fuv from pagb stars diminishes because , in spite of the higher luminosity , the duration of the pagb phase gets much shorter ( i.e. , the fuel decreases ) .",
    "this causes the fuv - nuv colour to become redder .",
    "however , the situation could be more complex if ` anomalous ' sub - populations , such as those suggested to be responsible for the uv - upturn of elliptical galaxies , were present",
    ". several populations could develop hot horizontal branch ( hhb ) and agb manqu stars : very helium - rich stars such as those recently found in globular cluster multiple stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ultra metal - rich stars @xcite ; or normal metallicity stars with enhanced mass loss @xcite .",
    "such populations could contribute , if not dominate , the fuv light .",
    "the effects of such extreme populations will be the subject of a forthcoming investigation .    for populations younger than 1 - 2 gyr ( depending on the metallicity ) this trend is inverted , since the turnoff starts to contribute significantly to the fuv band .",
    "thus the ( fuv - nuv ) colour becomes steeply bluer with decreasing age .",
    "we conclude that the fuv - nuv colour profile can not be used alone to discriminate between negative age or metallicity gradients .",
    "we know however from studies based on absorption line indices that strong negative metallicity gradients are present in etgs .",
    "thus , the ( fuv - nuv ) colour trend may be , at least in part , due to a metallicity effect .",
    "three out of the five rejuvenated galaxies in the top left panel of figure  [ fig5 ] ( ngc 1521 , ngc 6958 , ngc 7332 ) display redder colours than the ` old ' galaxies .",
    "we notice that the _ galex _ ( fuv - nuv ) colour is not very sensitive to reddening for milky way - type dust ( an e(b - v)=0.3 implies a @xmath34 m @xmath130.2 ) .",
    "thus , if the red colours were due to a reddening effect , we should have an extinction as high as e(b - v)@xmath350.5 .",
    "it is unlikely that such a strong extinction is present over several galaxy effective radii .",
    "for this reason , we interpret the observed colours as intrinsic .",
    "lick indices do not show evidence for particularly low metallicities in the 5 galaxies . on the contrary ,",
    "the metallicities are quite high in all but ngc 7332 consistent with their high velocity dispersions ( @xmath36200 km  s@xmath21 ) .",
    "thus , we suggest that the observed uv colours further support the presence of young luminosity - weighted ages in these galaxies .    in the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we plot separately the profiles of four galaxies , namely ngc  128 , ngc  2911 , ngc  5638 and ngc  7192 .",
    "their luminosity - weighted ages range from 5.7@xmath28 2.0 ( ngc  7192 and ngc  2911 ) to 9.7@xmath281.7 gyr ( ngc  128 ) while their metallicities are solar or twice solar ( ngc  2911 and ngc  7192 ) , the latter with a correspondingly high central velocity dispersion . their ( fuv - nuv ) colour profiles tend to be nearly flat .",
    "three out of four of these galaxies show a very faint uv emission extending out to 2 optical r@xmath23 .",
    "only the profile of ngc  128 extends up to 4 r@xmath23 and it is very similar to that of ngc  7332 ( top left panel ) , although much bluer ( ( fuv - nuv)@xmath131 ) in the first galaxy vs. @xmath132.2 in ngc  7332 .",
    "both galaxies are edge - on s0 , with nearly solar metallicity .    in the right bottom panel of figure  [ fig5 ] ,",
    "the colour profiles are characterized by the presence of blue rings , which appear as blue peaks in the ( fuv - nuv ) colours .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of this section , an abrupt blueing of the uv colours can be due to very recent star formation .",
    "notice however the presence of both rejuvenated ( ngc  3489 ) and old ( ngc  1533 , ngc  2974 ) nuclei as indicated by the ages derived in paper  iii in the r@xmath23/8 region .",
    "we examined the behaviour of the central ( fuv - nuv ) colour vs. the ` activity class ' ( see table  1 , column 11 ) .",
    "although most of our galaxies have a liner nuclei , seyfert , composite and inactive nucleus are present ( see paper  iv ) .",
    "we find that the central uv colour is totally uncorrelated with the activity class .",
    "the bluest ( fuv - nuv ) colours are seen in ngc  3258 and ngc  4552 nuclei , classified in paper  iv as composite , from diagnostic diagrams @xcite .",
    "ngc  3258 ( 4.5@xmath280.08 gyr ) and ngc  4552 ( 6.0@xmath281.4 ) could have experienced a recent star formation event .",
    "a similar result is found by @xcite on a large etg sample drown from the sdss dr6 .",
    "their analysis of the radial color gradient of etgs , shows that the so - called blue - cored galaxies , possible rejuvenated etgs , occupy both the star - formation and seyfert regions in the classical [ oiii]/h@xmath17 vs. [ nii]/h@xmath7 btp diagram @xcite .",
    "these authors suggest that most blue - cored etgs have centrally concentrated star formation and a smaller fraction could be associated with seyfert activity .      the fuv flux and the hi distributions correlate in star forming regions ( see e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context , we investigated in the literature the presence and the morphology of the large scale hi distribution in the present etg sample .    only a few objects have been observed . the hi",

    ", the hi distribution shows what appears to be a tidal tail , suggesting that the gas may have been acquired about 10@xmath37 years ago .",
    "we notice that in ngc  1052 there is no correlation between the hi distribution and the far uv emission .",
    "similar cases of tail - like hi distributions , decoupled from the far uv emission , have been detected in some shell galaxies , namely ngc  2865 , ngc  5018 and ngc  7135 @xcite .",
