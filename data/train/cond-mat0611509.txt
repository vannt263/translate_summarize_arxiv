    "<S> the binder cumulant ( bc ) has been widely used for locating the phase transition point accurately in systems with thermal noise . in systems with quenched disorder </S>",
    "<S> , the bc may show subtle finite - size effects due to large sample - to - sample fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we study the globally coupled kuramoto model of interacting limit - cycle oscillators with random natural frequencies and find an anomalous dip in the bc near the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dip is related to non - self - averageness of the order parameter at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> alternative definitions of the bc , which do not show any anomalous behavior regardless of the existence of non - self - averageness , are proposed .    </S>",
    "<S> the characterization of phase transitions relies mainly on the singularity structure of physical quantities at the transition , which can be quantified by critical exponent values . in numerical efforts , </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the estimated exponents heavily depends on the precision of locating the phase transition point . in the case of most thermal systems , the binder cumulant ( bc ) </S>",
    "<S> is widely believed to provide one of the most accurate tools for estimating the transition point  @xcite . the critical bc value at the transition is also believed to be universal , even though there is still controversy over its universality  @xcite .    in some complex systems  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the bc shows an anomalous negative dip in finite systems , which represents a rugged landscape ( multi - peak structure ) in the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> great care is required in analyzing numerical data to see whether the dip will vanish in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> if it does , the negative dips in the finite systems can be attributed to long - living metastable states . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , a nonvanishing negative dip usually implies that the transition is not continuous , but is of the first order .    in systems with quenched disorder </S>",
    "<S> , the disorder fluctuation may also generate an anomalous negative dip in the conventional bc , which is defined as the ratio of the disorder - averaged moments of the order parameter . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the negative dip may be related to the non - self - averageness ( nsa ) of the order parameter , which usually implies an extended and/or multi - peak structure in the disorder - averaged pdf  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a typical nonequilibrium dynamical system with quenched disorder , such as the kuramoto model of interacting limit - cycle oscillators with random natural frequencies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic synchronization transition is dominated by space - time fluctuations of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the quenched disorder is , by definition , perfectly correlated in the time direction , so it may generate strong disorder fluctuations similar to quantum systems with random defects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we recently showed that the disorder fluctuation was anomalously strong near the synchronization transition  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we take the globally coupled kuramoto model , which can be solved analytically to some extent . </S>",
    "<S> the model is defined by the set of equations of motion @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the phase of the @xmath2th limit - cycle oscillator @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term @xmath4 on the right - hand side denotes the natural frequency of the @xmath2th oscillator , where @xmath4 is assumed to be randomly distributed according to the gaussian distribution function @xmath5 characterized by the correlation @xmath6 and zero mean @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the natural frequency @xmath4 plays the role of _  quenched disorder\"_. the second term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : model ] ) represents global ( all - to - all ) coupling with equal coupling strength @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the sine coupling form is the most general representation of the coupling in the lowest order of the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) description@xcite , and its periodic nature is generic in limit - cycle oscillator systems . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath9 ) , so the neighboring oscillators favor their phase difference being minimized . </S>",
    "<S> the scattered natural frequencies and the coupling of the oscillators compete with each other . </S>",
    "<S> when the coupling becomes strong enough to overcome the dispersion of natural frequencies , macroscopic regions in which the oscillators are synchronized by sharing a coupling - modified common frequency @xmath10 may emerge .    </S>",
    "<S> collective phase synchronization is conveniently described by the complex order parameter defined by @xmath11 where the amplitude @xmath12 measures the phase synchronization and @xmath13 indicates the average phase . </S>",
    "<S> when the coupling is weak , each oscillator tends to evolve with its own natural frequency , resulting in the fully random desynchronized phase ( @xmath14 ) . as the coupling increases </S>",
    "<S> , some oscillators with @xmath15 become synchronized , and their phases @xmath16 start to show some ordering ( @xmath17 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) can be simplified to @xmath18 decoupled equations @xmath19 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are to be determined by imposing self - consistency . in the steady state ( @xmath20 ) , the self - consistency equation reads @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this equation has a nontrivial solution only when @xmath24 : @xmath25 with @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the exponent @xmath26 corresponds to the mean field ( mf ) value for systems of locally coupled oscillators  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we perform numerical integrations of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : model ] ) by using heun s method  @xcite for various system sizes of @xmath27 to @xmath28 . for a given distribution of disorder @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> , we average over time in the steady state after some transient time . after the time average </S>",
    "<S> , we also average over disorder . </S>",
    "<S> typically , we take the time step @xmath30 , the maximum number of time steps @xmath31 , and the number of samples @xmath32 . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath33 ( unit variance ) ; then , the corresponding critical parameter value is @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : gl_m ] shows the behavior of the phase synchronization order parameter @xmath12 against the coupling strength @xmath35 for various system sizes @xmath18 . in the weak coupling region ( @xmath36 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the order parameter approaches zero as @xmath37 , which is a characteristic of the fully random phase . in the strong coupling region @xmath38 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 saturates to a finite value , indicating a phase transition at @xmath39 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath40 , which is consistent with the analytic result .    to pin down the transition point @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> precisely , we use the binder cumulant method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth - order cumulant of the order parameter , the binder cumulant ( bc ) , is defined in thermal systems as @xmath42}{3[\\langle \\delta^2   \\rangle]^2 } b_{\\delta } =   1-\\frac{\\langle \\delta^4 \\rangle } { 3\\langle \\delta^2   \\rangle^2 } , \\label{eq : gl_bm}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 represents the thermal ( time ) average . in systems with quenched disorder , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we should consider the disorder average besides the thermal one . </S>",
    "<S> we may first consider the bc as the disorder - averaged moment ratio  @xcite @xmath44}{3[\\langle \\delta^2 \\rangle]^2 } , \\label{eq : gl_bm_old}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 $ ] denotes the disorder average , i.e. , the average over different realizations of @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : gl_bm_old ] displays @xmath46 as a function of the coupling strength @xmath35 for various system sizes @xmath18 . in the region of weak coupling @xmath47 , we expect the random nature of the oscillator phases @xmath48 to yield an asymmetric poisson - like probability distribution function ( pdf ) characterized by @xmath49 with a constant @xmath50 , which leads to @xmath51 . on the other hand , in the strong - coupling region , </S>",
    "<S> the pdf becomes a @xmath52-like function with a very narrow variance , which leads to @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 are consistent with our predictions </S>",
    "<S> .    however , near the transition , the @xmath46 shows a big anomalous _  dip \" _ on the desynchronized side . as the system size increases , the dip develops initially with a broad width and then becomes sharper and also deeper . </S>",
    "<S> the dip s position moves toward the transition point . </S>",
    "<S> the crossing points seem to nicely converge to the critical point @xmath54 . however , as the system size increases , the presence of the dip starts to hinder us in locating the critical point accurately .    in this letter , we explain why the dip develops in this system and propose alternative definitions of the binder cumulant that do not show any dip in the same system . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the disorder ( sample - to - sample ) fluctuations defined as @xmath55}{[\\langle{\\cal o}\\rangle]^2}-1 , \\label{eq : a}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is any observable , such as @xmath12 and @xmath57 , in a system . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is positive definite and is supposed to vanish in the thermodynamic limit in _ self - averaging _ systems and to remain finite in non - self - averaging systems  @xcite . as one can see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gl_a ] , the disorder fluctuation @xmath58 is quite sizable in the range of @xmath35 where the dip appears ( @xmath59 shows a similar behavior ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the @xmath46 shows a dip where the system is not well self - averaged . </S>",
    "<S> a careful finite - size analysis on @xmath58 reveals that it vanishes as @xmath60 away from criticality , but saturates to a finite value at criticality . </S>",
    "<S> the non - self - averageness at criticality is not surprising because the quenched randomness in natural frequencies should be relevant at this transition .    </S>",
    "<S> strong disorder fluctuations may cause non - negligible spreading of the _ effective _ coupling constants over different realizations of disorder  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : pdf ] shows for 20 independent samples , the pdf of @xmath12 just below the transition and obtained from the time series of @xmath12 after the system had reached the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a large part of the sample - to - sample variations can be interpreted as a shift in the @xmath41 of individual samples . </S>",
    "<S> the two quantities @xmath61}$ ] and @xmath62 $ ] in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gl_bm_old ] ) can be considered as the second and the fourth moments of the disorder - averaged pdf , which is much broader than the individual pdfs near the transition . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily see that broadening yields a larger value for the ratio @xmath62/[\\langle\\delta^2\\rangle]^2 $ ] and , hence , a smaller bc . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is particularly pronounced on the small @xmath35 side of the transition , where @xmath12 itself is small , in which case a shift in @xmath41 has a stronger influence on the moments .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative definition for the binder cumulant for systems with quenched disorder ( especially non - diminishing disorder fluctuations ) is@xcite @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : gl_bm_new}\\ ] ] we note that the disorder average is performed over the ratio of the time - averaged moments . </S>",
    "<S> the moment ratio is calculated for each sample first and , is then averaged over disorder . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that this definition of the binder cumulant should eliminate the most dominant contribution from the disorder fluctuations , i.e. ,  the anomaly caused by the spreading of the effective coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> this definition has been adopted mostly in quantum disorder systems , where strong disorder fluctuations are anticipated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : gl_bm_new ] displays @xmath64 versus @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the dip shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gl_bm_old ] disappears and that the crossing points nicely converge to @xmath41 , implying that @xmath64 should serve better for locating the transition point than the conventional one , which is confirmed numerically ( not shown here ) .    </S>",
    "<S> yet another definition of the binder cumulant is @xmath65}{3[\\langle \\delta^2 \\rangle^2]}. \\label{eq : gl_bm_newer}\\ ] ] we expect that @xmath66 may also behave smoothly near the transition because it does not involve disorder fluctuation terms such as @xmath45 ^ 2 $ ] included in @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : gl_bm_newer ] displays @xmath67 versus @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , we find no anomalous behavior in @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we can directly relate @xmath46 and @xmath66 through the disorder fluctuation @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> simple algebra leads to @xmath68 as the disorder fluctuation @xmath58 becomes larger , @xmath69 shows a bigger dip . </S>",
    "<S> this explains quantitatively the size and the location of the dip in @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical value of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) provides additional information on the temporal variations of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that @xmath72/[\\langle\\delta^2\\rangle^2]$ ] , where @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical result indicates that the relative temporal fluctuations are almost negligible even at criticality . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath70 is not practically useful in locating the transition point accurately .    in summary , we studied binder cumulants in the quenched disorder system . for the kuramoto model </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the conventionally defined bc shows a big anomalous dip near the transition . </S>",
    "<S> this dip is shown to be directly related to the disorder fluctuation ( non - self - averageness ) . </S>",
    "<S> alternative definitions of the bc , which did not show any anomalous behavior were proposed and may be useful in locating the transition point accurately in general systems with quenched disorder . </S>"
