    "in recognition of the hazard posed to the earth by asteroid impact , congress has mandated that nasa undertake a near earth object ( neo ) survey program to detect , catalog , and track neos of 140  m diameter and larger .",
    "the recent passage of a 7  m diameter asteroid 2009 va in nov 2009 within only one earth diameter emphasizes that this is a real threat , and the fact that only a small fraction of such close passages are detected reminds us that we are in fact in a continuous storm of small asteroids passing close by . in the previous year",
    ", the earth was struck by 2008 tc3 on 7 oct 2008 in the sudan .",
    "( a description and references can be found at the jpl neo website , neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/2008tc3.html . )",
    "perhaps more disturbing , on october 8 , 2009 a @xmath050  kton atmospheric explosion occurred over indonesia that is thought to have been caused by a @xmath010  m asteroid impacting the atmosphere .",
    "( the jpl description is at neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news165.html . )",
    "the article by asphaug ( 2009 ) reviews what is known about asteroid populations and characteristics .",
    "( we use the term `` asteroid '' to mean any small solar system body , asteroid , comet , meteor , etc . )",
    "the population of asteroids is quite well known as a function of brightness , usually characterized by the @xmath1 magnitude ( @xmath2 band magnitude the asteroid would have at 1  au distance from both the sun and observer , viewed at opposition ) .",
    "the number of main belt asteroids goes approximately as the @xmath3 power of size , but the number of small ( @xmath4200  m ) neos reported by brown et al .",
    "( 2002 ) goes more like the @xmath5 power of size .",
    "since the arrival impact energy goes as the cube of the asteroid size the net arrival energy is more or less uniform per logarithmic size interval .",
    "conversion from observed population to surface destruction involves an estimate of albedo to derive size ( usually taken as a weighted average of @xmath00.14 combining @xmath00.20 for the s - type asteroids that predominate among neos and @xmath00.05 for the c - type that are the most numerous in the solar system ) , an estimate of density to derive mass ( usually taken as @xmath023  g  @xmath6 for s - type , although ice - dominated comets have a density less than water , c - type are @xmath01.5  g  @xmath6 , and m - type may have a density in excess of 6  g  @xmath6 ) , an estimate of arrival velocity ( typically @xmath015  km  s@xmath7 , but there is a broad distribution ) , and an estimate of the fraction of energy that couples through the atmosphere to ground destruction .",
    "an asteroid of @xmath1 magnitude of 22 is therefore taken to have a diameter of 140  m and to carry about 100  mton of kinetic energy .",
    "morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) perform this calculation in much more detail and fidelity .",
    "the atmosphere has a surface density equivalent to about 10  m of water so we can expect that an impactor must be _ considerably _ larger than @xmath010  m before a substantial fraction of its kinetic energy reaches the ground instead of being dissipated in the atmosphere . for example , melosh and collins ( 2005 ) calculate that the @xmath030  m iron impactor that created the 1.2  km meteor crater in arizona delivered only @xmath02.5  mton to the ground of @xmath09  mton of arrival kinetic energy .",
    "boslough and crawford ( 2008 ) performed a detailed hydrocode calculation of low - altitude airbursts from asteroid impact , using the tunguska explosion that flattened trees over an area of @xmath01000  km@xmath8 in 1908 as a calibrator , and found that it is not a good assumption to compare an asteroid impact to a stationary point explosion ( e.g. nuclear bomb test ) at the altitude where the asteroid explodes .",
    "one difference is that the wake from the incoming object creates a channel by which the explosion is directed upward , and even a few mton explosion will rise hundreds of kilometers into space .",
    "another difference is that the incoming momentum carries the fireball and shock wave much lower than an equivalent point explosion , causing commensurately more damage on the ground .",
    "they also performed a calculation of the effects of a 100  mton stony impactor and found that although the asteroid explodes before it hits the ground , the fireball touches down over a diameter of 10  km with temperatures in excess of 5000  k for 10 seconds .    the 2007 impact in carancas , peru of a relatively small ( @xmath03  m , 1  ton kinetic energy ) chondrite left a 13  m crater .",
    "this seems to indicate that there are mechanisms by which a small impactor can couple significant energy to the ground , although most , like 2008 tc3 or the explosion over indonesia in 2009 , will explode harmlessly , high in the atmosphere .",
    "we are therefore left with some uncertainty about the frequency of damage from asteroid impact .",
    "the calibration by brown et al .",
    "( 2002 ) of small neos is based on the rate of large fireballs from atmospheric impacts and a conversion from optical to explosion energy , and this is joined onto estimates from counts of asteroids as a function of @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "the rate of impacts by large asteroids ( 140  m and larger ) is estimated to only one per 20,000 years or more , the rate of impacts by 50  m , tunguska - sized objects ( 5  mton arrival kinetic energy ) is about one per 1,000 years , and the rate of 10  m ( 40  kton arrival kinetic energy ) impacts is about one per decade ( nrc report , 2010 ) .",
    "these rates are probably uncertain to a factor of at least two , and the work of boslough and crawford illustrates the difficulty in predicting surface damage from the incident kinetic energy .",
    "the nasa neo report ( 2007 ) found that a combination of planned surveys by pan - starrs-4 and lsst could reach 83% completeness for 140  m diameter neos by 2026 .",
    "the total architecture cost was estimated at about $ 500 m in fy06 dollars . in order to speed up and improve the detection probability",
    ", nasa found that an additional $ 800 m to $ 1b for either an additional lsst system dedicated to potentially hazardous object ( pho ) detection or a dedicated space imager could bring the completion limit to better than 90% by 2020 .",
    "this conclusion was affirmed in the recent report by the nrc report `` defending planet earth : near - earth object surveys and hazard mitigation '' ( 2010 ) on survey and mitigation strategies that nasa might pursue to reduce the risk from hazardous objects , but they stressed the severe tension between cost and survey completion deadline , and suggested that 2030 may be a more attainable goal , although still at high cost .",
    "the nrc report also recognized that the damage from relatively small asteroids in the 3050  m range may be greater than heretofore appreciated , and recommended that `` surveys should attempt to detect as many 3050-meter objects as possible '' .",
    "we believe that , while the final solution of finding , cataloging , and tracking 90% of asteroids of 140  m is very hard , the technology to find most asteroids of 50  m or larger on their final approach is now in hand .",
    "although this may not give us enough warning to mount a mission to deflect the asteroid , it should give us enough warning to know exactly where and when the impact will occur .",
    "lives can be saved by moving out of the impact area or away from the tsunami run - up , even though loss of property is unavoidable .",
    "we describe how the construction and operation of a new sky survey could continually scan the visible sky .",
    "this facility , entitled `` asteroid terrestrial - impact last alert system '' ( atlas ) would use an array of eight wide - field , fast telescopes equipped with large detector arrays to scan the visible sky ( @xmath020,000  sq  deg ) twice per night .",
    "its sky completeness gives us a better than 50% chance of detecting any 50  m asteroid approaching from a random direction , and its sensitivity provides three week s warning of 140  m objects and one week for 50  m asteroids .",
    "the second section discusses the meaning of `` etendue '' generally , and presents equations for `` survey '' and signal to noise ( snr ) achievable from a survey instrument , even in the regime of undersampled pixels .",
    "this lays the foundation for evaluation of how scientific goals can be met by a given survey implementation .",
    "the third section presents details of the atlas concept and describes how it compares with other surveys , present and planned .",
    "the fourth section describes how atlas performs in its role of detecting hazardous asteroids as well as other science topics .",
    "we find that atlas has some very interesting capabilities beyond early warning and is quite complementary to other existing or planned surveys .",
    "we conclude with thoughts on how atlas could provide the seed for a `` world - wide internet survey telescope '' that could improve the probability of detection and the warning time of approaching impactors .",
    "the technical term `` etendue '' means the product in an optical system of the solid angle and cross - sectional area occupied by the bundle of light rays .",
    "liouville s theorem guarantees that this product is conserved throughout the optical system , provided there is no absorption . in particular , at the entrance aperture , the product of solid angle seen on the sky times the collection area is a measure of how large the `` grasp '' of an optical system is .",
    "this `` etendue '' product is therefore often adopted as a measure of the merit of proposed survey systems , with some understanding that it has something to do with the rate at which scientific value can be accrued .",
    "the information content in @xmath9 independent measurements at signal to noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath10 is expressible in @xmath11 bits .",
    "if our science goal is to generate a catalog of independent quantities , this might be an appropriate metric for the trade - off between quantity @xmath9 against quality @xmath10 to maximize information . however , an important and common science goal is accumulation of snr for a measurement to which many correlated observations contribute . in this case",
    "the science value lies in the snr of the sum or other combination of measurements that are presumed to be highly correlated , and the information content goes as @xmath12 , or @xmath13 if we do this for a number of classes of inquiry , collecting @xmath14 objects in each class with snr @xmath15 .",
    "colloquially , the net snr from averaging @xmath9 measurements improves as @xmath16 .",
    "this sum , @xmath17 , is in fact the standard metric that is used to evaluate the capability of a survey system .",
    "it is not unique , nor is it appropriate for all scientific goals ( for example it does not optimize detection rate of stellar occulations by hot jupiters , where the dependency of capability on @xmath15 is essentially a step function at @xmath18 ) , but it does describe the main scientific purposes to which survey data are usually applied . we will use the term `` '' henceforth to mean `` accumulation of @xmath17 per unit time '' in order that `` etendue '' can be reserved for its technical use .    in the poisson limited case , where the variance is proportional to the number of photons collected and @xmath14 is proportional to the solid angle surveyed , @xmath19 does not depend on how survey time is apportioned between area coverage and depth ",
    "is basically the number of photons collected from objects of class @xmath20 regardless of which objects the photons come from .",
    "there are two curbs on this covariance , apart from the details of luminosity function or spatial distribution .",
    "the first arises when systematic error at extremely low or high @xmath15 ( e.g. `` read noise '' or `` flatfielding error '' ) slows the growth of information from @xmath21  it is often not practical to increase @xmath14 without bound by permitting @xmath15 to become arbitrarily small , nor do we necessarily gain by arbitrarily increasing @xmath15 on a single object .",
    "the second limit arises when @xmath14 becomes so large within a solid angle that objects blur together  their perceived fluxes are no longer independent , which again limits the growth of information . if we assign a footprint solid angle @xmath22 to an object blurred by the point spread function ( psf ) and consider an object to have value only if no other object s footprint overlaps its center , the maximum density of isolated objects is achieved when the overall number density is @xmath23 , at which point the density of non - overlapped objects is lower by the natural logarithm base , @xmath24 .",
    "apart from these considerations , and for known objects with sufficient density on the sky or randomly positioned objects , maximizing @xmath14 is tantamount to maximizing the solid angle that can be observed per unit time .",
    "therefore we can consider the survey metric to be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the survey solid angle , but remembering that this is not valid when @xmath15 is low enough to be affected by systematics or when the psf and object footprint is large enough that objects start to overlap .",
    "the survey  is the rate at which @xmath27 is accumulated .",
    "recovery of an unresolved object s flux in the face of blurring and noise is a finely honed art . for uniform",
    ", independent gaussian noise the optimum snr occurs by cross - correlating ( often mis - named convolving ) the image with the psf .",
    "more generally , the optimum cross - correlation kernel is just the wiener filter , whose fourier transform ( ft ) depends on those of the psf , @xmath28 , and the noise , @xmath29 : @xmath30 . in the limit that an object is faint compared to the noise",
    "the optimum kernel then devolves to the psf itself , but if the object s noise variance is significant or if the background noise is correlated ( e.g. by rebinning ) the optimal kernel becomes narrower in image space .",
    "note that this is true for undersampled images as well , where it is understood that the kernel is the convolution of a `` physical psf '' ( meaning distribution of delivered flux prior to integration within a pixel ) with a detector pixel _ with phase shift _ , i.e. the optimal kernel depends on the exact sub - pixel position where the object lies .",
    "the net snr from a faint point source of total flux @xmath31 spread over a unity integral psf @xmath32 , in the face of independent , gaussian noise variance per unit area ( square arcsec , for example ) @xmath33 , derived from integration against a unity integral kernel @xmath34 is just @xmath35^{1/2 } }               = { f\\over\\sigma } \\ ; [ \\smallint p^2 ] ^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : snrpsf}\\ ] ] where the right side expresses the snr when the psf is used as an optimal kernel .",
    "we integrated equation [ eq : snrpsf ] for a variety of popular psf models , with results from the well - sampled regime given in table  [ tab : psf ] . since @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] for a given psf must be inversely proportional to the spatial scale in order to maintain unity integral , the snr will be proportional to @xmath37 , where we use the full width half maximum ( fwhm )  as a convenient measure of the psf extent .",
    "we see that aperture photometry delivers an snr that is about 12% worse than psf integration .",
    ".snr for different psfs [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : psf ]    notes : the profiles are gaussian , a kolmogorov @xmath38 profile , a moffat ( power of a lorentzian ) profile @xmath39 with @xmath40 recommended by trujillo et al .",

    "we also performed these integrations into the extremely undersampled regime , averaging snr@xmath8 over psf position within a square pixel , and found that a reasonable fit to the results for the middle three ( atmospheric ) psfs from table  [ tab : psf ] is @xmath44 where  is the _ physical _ fwhm , @xmath45 is the pixel size , @xmath33 is the background noise variance per unit area , and @xmath31 is the total flux in the faint point source .",
    "equation  [ eq : snrfwhm ] is therefore a good approximation for atmospheric psfs , regardless of undersampling .",
    "an application of equation  [ eq : snrfwhm ] is selection of pixel size for optimal snr , trading off read noise against background noise variance .",
    "( for zero read noise the optimum is an infinitely small pixel . )",
    "if we add @xmath46 to @xmath33 , where @xmath47 is the read noise per pixel , we can solve for the pixel size that maximizes the snr .",
    "an approximate solution to the quartic equation is given by @xmath48 since @xmath49 is the pixel size at which the read noise equals the sky noise , the pixel that optimizes photometry snr is @xmath50 times the geometric mean of the physical fwhm and the size that balances read noise against sky noise ( which depends on bandpass and sky brightness ) .",
    "a survey system s ability to capture photons from a source depends on its aperture and obstruction , vignetting , filter bandwidth and throughput , atmospheric throughput , detector quantum efficiency and fill factor which we bundle into a single throughput number @xmath51 .",

    "let us define the `` psf footprint '' @xmath22 as the solid angle that carries background noise equal to @xmath31/snr for a faint point source of flux @xmath31 and snr defined by the flux measurement algorithm in use ( e.g. those in table  [ tab : psf ] ) , so that we can calculate snr for a given object by comparing its total flux to the noise found in this `` psf footprint '' .",

    "as argued in the section above , most science value is not changed by tradeoffs that keep the product @xmath90 constant . in practice scientists",

    "the cadence time is defined as the mean time required to survey @xmath26 , but the survey may include a great deal of valuable temporal sampling when the survey includes multiple exposures .",
    "for example , the ps1 - 3pi survey is specifically designed to detect moving objects with pairs of exposures on a @xmath015  min interval .",
    "it is therefore not safe to conclude that @xmath79 listed in table  [ tab : surveys ] is the shortest time interval for detection of motion or variability .",
    "it is instructive to examine how the atlas proposal differs from hat - south and pan - starrs1 .",

    "pan - starrs1 and atlas have nearly the same product of @xmath118 ( collect photons at the same rate ) , but of course pan - starrs1 has about an order of magnitude higher  than atlas because @xmath22 is so much smaller .",
    "it is not worthwhile to try to split hairs about which survey is the `` best '' or most capable ; many of the parameters in the table above are rough enough that it is not possible to make an accurate comparison .",
    "even more important , the table fails to clarify all the factors which make the various surveys especially well tuned for the science they are trying to do .",
    "however , atlas does occupy an important portion of design space .",
    "it is an order of magnitude faster than existing neo surveys , it reaches much fainter magnitudes than the other sub - day cadence surveys , and it is unique in surveying the entire sky several times per night . while some of the other systems could move at constant  to cover the entire sky nightly , they would not be able to do so at nearly the sensitivity of atlas .",
    "atlas is complementary to general surveys such as pan - starrs , skymapper , and lsst .",
    "like these it covers most of the sky , but it offers a much faster cadence at the cost of less sensitivity , fewer colors , and less resolution . as described in the next section , there is a great deal of science to be found in this brighter , faster regime of discovery space in addition to the primary mission of finding asteroids approaching the earth .",
    "atlas is first and foremost a system to warn of incoming objects that might hit the earth .",
    "atlas is not optimized to find objects at 1 au and @xmath119 , many of which are known and will never strike the earth .",
    "other systems , notably pan - starrs and eventually lsst , have the leisure to find and catalog these better .",
    "fortunately the interval between collisions of the earth with an object of @xmath050  m or larger is many centuries , the impact at tunguska in 1908 notwithstanding .",
    "however , the cumulative frequency of earth impacts as a function of the size of impactor has been estimated by brown et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as @xmath120 so we can expect an impact of a 2030  m asteroid once per century , a nearly mton - class explosion . although most of the incident energy will be dissipated high in the atmosphere , we have already discussed the evidence that it could cause significant damage on the ground as well .",
    "20  m occurs when a significant fraction has warning time greater than one day , and the kink at @xmath0140  m is caused by an increasing fraction of greater than one orbit warning times . ]",
    "we have developed a detailed atlas simulator that integrates the orbits of neos or impactors from veres et al ( 2009 ) , either 10,000 impactors chosen to strike the earth randomly in location and time over the next 100 years , or the full population of 270,000 neos .",
    "it is important to note that earth impactors have a different orbit distribution from neos or even potentially hazardous objects ( pho s )  the impactor s orbit distribution is shifted to smaller semi - major axis , eccentricity and inclination .",
    "( diameter @xmath0140  m ) whose orbit passes within 0.05  au of the earth s orbit ; an `` impactor '' is an object that actually strikes the earth within 100 years . ]",
    "this is what makes atlas so effective at identifying _",
    "impactors _ as opposed to generic neos .",
    "if an asteroid can hit the earth , its orbit must intersect the earth s orbit and atlas s small search volume and fast cadence is ideal for finding them .",
    "the simulator uses atlas s view of each night s sky , schedules the observing time , examines each asteroid for visibility according to its apparent magnitude and the observation s extinction , trailing losses , and weather , and decides that an asteroid has been `` found '' when it has been observed 8 times in 4 tracklets or else has an accurate parallax .",
    "atlas can detect more than half of impactors larger than 50  m and almost two thirds of 140  m impactors , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : warnfrac ] .",
    "the asteroids that atlas misses slip in from the direction of the sun and south pole or during periods of bad weather .",
    "( an atlas copy in the southern hemisphere or in a different weather pattern would raise the detection fraction . )",
    "figure  [ fig : warning ] illustrates the distribution of warning times provided by atlas . objects of 140  m diameter are typically detected 20  days before impact while 50  m diameter objects are detected with a week s notice , when they are @xmath015 times the distance to the moon .",
    "simultaneous images from the two sites provide a @xmath121 parallax when the object is closer than 0.1  au , about two weeks before impact .",
    "the parallax is crucial for identification of an approaching asteroid in a single night and important for vetoing confusion with space junk .    looking at the full neo and pho populations , the right panel of figure  [ fig : warning ] shows the rate at which asteroids are found by atlas .",
    "atlas will ( re)discover 50% of all 1000  m neos and phos within 1 year , 70% in 3 years , and 90% in 10 years . the net rate of detection of 140  m asteroids or larger should be more than 400 neos and 100 phos per year . atlas can find about 15% of all 140  m phos within 3 years and 30% within 10 years , slightly less than what veres et al ( 2009 ) found for the pan - starrs-1 mission .",
    "atlas is not a direct competitor for the much more capable surveys such as pan - starrs-4 or lsst .",
    "however , for the crucial days and weeks that an impactor is on final approach , atlas is far more effective than any existing neo survey , pan - starrs , or lsst .",
    "the coverage and cadence that atlas provides gives us a high probability of seeing an incoming asteroid , and atlas s sensitivity is enough to spot it while it is still reasonably distant .",
    "when atlas detects a nearby object it will automatically provide the measurements to the minor planet center for posting on their web - based neo confirmation page . at that time , in a manner similar to the rapid followup of the first pre - impact identification of meteoroid 2008 tc@xmath122 ( jenniskens et al .",
    "2009 ) , we expect other amateur and professional observers to obtain additional observations .",
    "the case of 2008 tc@xmath122 demonstrates the amazing accuracy that can be achieved : jpl s predictions were accurate to @xmath020  sec and @xmath0100  km within hours of discovery , and the eventual prediction was accurate to @xmath01.5  sec and @xmath01  km .      atlas will monitor a large number of asteroids in the main belt as well as asteroids and comets elsewhere in the solar system .",
    "the rapid time cadence of atlas is particularly well suited to providing light curves and simultaneous colors for many asteroids that can then be analyzed to infer asteroid shape and tumbling motion .",
    "atlas should achieve photometry in two colors with 0.01 mag accuracy at @xmath123 , 0.02 mag accuracy at @xmath124 , and 0.04 mag accuracy at @xmath125 .",
    "the astdys web site ( hamilton.dm.unipi.it/astdys ) lists 973 numbered asteroids with @xmath126 , 3,149 with @xmath127 , and 10,078 with @xmath128 at this moment in time ( 2010 - 10 - 10 ) in the 3/8 sky between ra 18@xmath129 and 6@xmath129 and dec @xmath130 to @xmath131 .",
    "most are considerably off of opposition right now , so have been or will be brighter during the 45 months it takes to sweep by . therefore atlas should provide twice - nightly two color light curves of @xmath04 month duration for at least 2,000 asteroids at an accuracy of 0.01 mag per point , 6,000 asteroids with an accuracy of 0.02 mag , and 20,000 asteroids with an accuracy of 0.04 mag .",
    "it has been estimated by r. jedicke ( private communication ) that there is a collision each day that disrupts a 10  m asteroid in the main belt . if the dust cloud from the collision grows to 1000  m before becoming optically thin the collision should be detectable by atlas .",
    "the recent asteroid collision event p/2010 a2 discovered by linear achieved @xmath132 and would be detectable by atlas .",
    "an object in the outer solar system must have @xmath133 to be detectable by atlas , so atlas is unlikely to add many new discoveries to the bodies already known or that will be discovered by pan - starrs1 .",
    "the value from atlas is completeness and ongoing monitoring of 3/4 of the sky . if an object has slipped between the cracks of other surveys , or happens to brighten ( e.g. tumbling ) , or is rapidly approaching ( e.g. new comets ) atlas may be the first to discover it .",
    "the current iau definition of a dwarf planet is a body with @xmath134 . with full illumination , at 60  au distance ( approximately the outer edge of the kuiper belt ) , such a body would have a @xmath2 magnitude of 18.8 , and therefore be easily detectable by atlas .",
    "atlas should therefore detect virtually all dwarf planets in the solar system within one year , and be particularly useful for searching well out of the ecliptic , where such bodies might have scattered .",
    "snia have proven utility as measures of the cosmological expansion of the universe , and it is hoped to continue with even more subtle questions such as whether the accelerated expansion is consistent with a cosmological constant . since we do not understand very well the environment , initial conditions , trigger mechanism , and explosion process of snia , these extremely delicate measurements are vulnerable to systematic errors .    a type ia supernova at @xmath135 peaks at @xmath136 .",
    "the atlas sensitivity at snr=10 is 19.5 per day ; assuming 70% clear weather , the atlas sensitivity for 4 nights is @xmath137 for snr=10 . according to mannucci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) there are some 9,000 snia yearly closer than @xmath135 ( 32,000 at @xmath138 ) .",
    "since the area that atlas surveys each night is half of the entire sky ( neglecting obscuration by the galactic plane ) , we can expect that atlas will find and follow 4,500 snia per year at @xmath139 and snr  @xmath140 and 16,000 snia per year at @xmath138 with snr  @xmath141 , with a 4 day sampling of the light curve .",
    "perhaps more interesting from the standpoint of investigating systematics , atlas should find some 300 snia per year that peak at @xmath127 , and @xmath030 per year peaking at @xmath142 .",
    "this is nearly an order of magnitude greater than the discovery rate of bright snia over the past decade , and has the advantage of being completely unbiased .",
    "by contrast , the kait telescope ( li et al , 2003 ) finds approximately 75 supernovae per year by patrolling nearby galaxies .",
    "the huge number of snia discovered by atlas as well as the completeness of examining the entire sky will empower us to ask questions such as characterization of explosion as a function of host galaxy properties , details of the very early phases of the explosion , and identification of outlier events that can be flagged for spectroscopy or more detailed photometry .",
    "we can also expect to see a large number of snia in interesting environments such as rich clusters or tidal streams of interacting galaxies .",
    "core collapse supernovae ( ccsn ) are particularly interesting when they result in a huge , collimated explosion creating a gamma ray burst .",
    "these are thought to occur in low metallicity environments from wr stars that have a high core angular momentum at time of collapse .",

    "although ligo has yet to detect a gravity wave ( gw ) event , it is virtually certain that gravity waves exist and highly likely that advanced ligo will detect gw events .",

    "abadie et al .",

    "such an explosion corresponds to a luminosity with absolute magnitude of @xmath156 for a duration of two days .",

    "the distance modulus of 445  mpc is 38.2 , so an explosion of @xmath159 would be just detectable by atlas , provided that it happens within the half sky visible to atlas and endures long enough for atlas to sweep across it . the nearest object that advanced ligo would see in one year would be a factor of @xmath160 closer , 2.7  mag brighter , and easily seen by atlas .",
    "the coalescence of compact objects creates a well defined gw signal and an extremely ill - defined optical transient . on the other hand , core - collapse supernovae ( ccsn )",
    "are common , and ott ( 2009 ) has reviewed their possible gw signatures and the ability of advanced ligo to detect them .",
    "advanced ligo may be able to detect a ccsn within 1  mpc with signal to noise of @xmath161 , but the rate of such supernovae within the local group is only one in @xmath162 years .",

    "atlas s sensitivity , solid angle , and cadence has an excellent overlap with the densities of agn and their various sources of variation .",
    "well sampled light curves with time scales ranging from days to years are key to studying agn variability .    at @xmath178",
    "there are 1800 galaxies per square degree , so atlas will maintain a daily watch on some 40 million galaxies , sensitive to events whose luminosity is comparable to that of the galaxy on a 1 day timescale or longer . for example",
    ", a star is occasionally disrupted by accretion onto a black hole at the center of a galaxy , producing a flare of predictable color and duration .",
    "gezari et al .",
    "( 2009 ) predict a volume rate of @xmath179  yr@xmath7mpc@xmath180 , and calculate that a survey with @xmath181 would detect events out to 200 mpc , corresponding to detection rate of 20 events per year by atlas .",
    "even at the north galactic pole there are about 2000 stars per square degree brighter than the 1 day limiting magnitude of @xmath178 . over the entire 20,000 sq deg",
    "being surveyed each night by atlas there are about a half billion stars far enough off of the galactic plane that there is manageable confusion in atlas s 4.4@xmath182 pixels .",
    "han ( 2008 ) estimates the rate of near - field microlensing from all sky surveys and finds that at @xmath183 we can expect to see 23 events per year , where an event is defined as an increase of source flux by more than 0.32 mag .",
    "the number scales as @xmath184 , so at @xmath185 there should be 58 lensing events over the sky per year . at @xmath183",
    "the lens - source proper motion can exceed 40  mas  yr@xmath7 so we could hope to disentangle their light after a few years by imaging from space or ground - based adaptive optics .",
    "the event timescales at the fainter limits are about 20 days .",
    "atlas will survey half the entire sky at snr 10 per night at @xmath101 , so a @xmath183 star will be captured with 0.025 mag uncertainty each night and a @xmath185 star will have 0.06 mag error each night . a 0.3 mag lensing event will therefore be seen at @xmath145 at @xmath183 and @xmath186 at @xmath185 . over 20 nights , even allowing for weather , atlas ought to capture most events to @xmath187 , and the two filters will permit some level of testing of achromaticity .",
    "we therefore estimate that atlas should see approximately 30 microlensing events in the near - field each year , and 10 should have high signal to noise and time coverage .",
    "there is a suprisingly large cross section for strong gravitational lensing by galaxy centers .",
    "we integrated the galaxy velocity dispersion function of sheth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , using both the densities listed for early - type galaxies and late - type galaxy bulges , assuming that each galaxy has an isothermal core capable of lensing . over the entire sky , the cross section for a lensing magnification of 3 or greater is 0.37  deg@xmath8 for sources at a redshift of @xmath188 , 1.75  deg@xmath8 for sources at a redshift of @xmath189 , etc , scaling as @xmath190 , where @xmath66 is the lensing magnification , and as @xmath191 in the euclidean limit .",
    "divided by the 41,250  deg@xmath8 of the sky , this cross section provides a magnification probability .",
    "the number of lensed snia that atlas will see , even aided by magnification , will barely yield one event per year . integrating the density of snia from mannucci et al ( 2007 ) against the lensing cross section",
    ", we expect to see one lensing event per year peaking at a ( magnified ) magnitude of 20.6 .",
    "of course this will be extremely hard to distinguish from the hordes of snia close to galaxy centers .    however , the number of magnified agn that atlas will detect is quite large . integrating the luminosity function of croom et al . against this cross section gives more than 40 agn in the sky with a magnification of 3 or larger at a magnitude of 19.6 or brighter ( @xmath147 at 10 days , @xmath145 at 1 day ) . among these",
    "there are @xmath192 at magnification 10 or greater .",
    "the lensing cross section grows rapidly with redshift , of course , so this is an interesting probe of agn density , agn variability as a function of redshift , and galaxy core structure as a function of redshift . at high magnifications",
    "the microlensing by stars within the lensing galaxy can cause substantial flickering as well .",
    "atlas has only modest sensitivity on a per - unit telescope basis , and it undersamples a point spread function that will average about 2.5  from atmosphere and optics , but the snr grows as each piece of the sky gets some 350 visits per year ( 3.1 mag ) . figure  [ fig : poss ] compares how an @xmath193  sq  deg piece of sky appears in the digital poss sky survey , the sdss sky survey , and atlas .",
    "deg portion of the sky in poss @xmath194 band is shown in the upper left , the view in the sdss @xmath99 band in the lower left , how it would appear in a single atlas red observation ( two 30 sec integrations ) in the upper right , and after a week of observation ( 5 clear nights ) in the lower right .",
    "the circled stars are @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 ( 5@xmath165 ) , and a pair at @xmath198 and 19.2 separated by 4.4 . ]",
    "atlas goes substantially deeper than poss after a week of observation , even allowing for weather .",
    "the sdss psf is considerably better than atlas can ever achieve , but figure  [ fig : dpsisky ] illustrates how the color co - added sky would look after a year of atlas observation ( with allowances for weather ) .",
    "deg portion of the sky after a year of atlas observation illustrates the appearance of snr @xmath145 at @xmath199 .",
    "although static objects are starting to blend together at this limit , variable objects are rare enough to stand out cleanly once the static sky is subtracted . ]    after a year s operation atlas is significantly deeper than sdss ( and covers 3/4 sky ) , although the coarse sampling eventually runs into source confusion . however , the density of transient and variable objects is far lower than the density of static objects , so atlas should stay above the confusion limit for detection and characterization of the variable parts of their light curves , with sensitivity to timescale @xmath200 that goes as @xmath201 .",
    "for example , atlas can achieve @xmath202 sensitivity for slow events such as agn variability or long - period variable stars .",
    "there is a growing amount of `` space junk '' in low earth orbit ( leo ) and geosynchronous earth orbit ( geo ) .",
    "this is of some concern for satellites and space travel , as evidenced by the recent destruction of an iridium satellite by collision with a tumbling booster . to sky surveys looking for transients and moving objects ,",
    "space junk is a significant background signal that masks the solar system objects we are interested in .",
    "a good rule of thumb for the detection of a streak across an image left by a moving object is that when each psf - sized segment of the streak is @xmath203 above background it is easily visible to the eye and easily detectable .",
    "a magnitude fainter is harder , and two magnitudes fainter is just about the limit of what can be detected .    a leo object at 1000  km range moves at about 0.4  deg / sec",
    ". atlas has four views , two staggered by 5  deg at each site and two sites , so many objects will have one or two endpoints caught by the system .",
    "a leo object will spend 3  msec on a pixel , and therefore the @xmath203 routine detection benchmark is 8.3 mag brighter than the @xmath186 magnitude limit for a 30 sec exposure , i.e. about @xmath204 . at @xmath205",
    "the streak will be visible to the eye and should be possible to detect automatically , particularly given the confirmation from the two sites and the possible collection by the adjacent pointing .",
    "this magnitude corresponds to a white , fully illuminated lambertian ball of size @xmath04  cm or a piece of space junk of size @xmath015  cm of albedo 0.1 and random illumination .",
    "there are estimated to be of order 10,000 objects in leo of that size or greater .",
    "a geo object only moves at 15/sec , spending 0.3  sec on a pixel , so the 1-sigma benchmark is 5 mag fainter than leo , i.e. @xmath206 .",
    "automated detection should be possible therefore to @xmath207 ( @xmath060  cm ) without much trouble . at 40,000",
    "km range , the tangential position accuracy should be approximately 100  m , and the range accuracy about 50  km for the single observation .",
    "since atlas sweeps the visible sky twice each night , geo objects will be captured on two occasions , permitting a good estimate of orbit .",
    "apart from its value as a survey for hazardous asteroids , atlas also serves to define a unit survey telescope and software that can be replicated many times in order to improve on the networked performance .",
    "atlas could therefore be a template for a `` world - wide internet survey telescope '' ( wist ) that has as many unit observatories as there are parties who would like to participate , since it is sized to fit within the budget of any college or university .    the atlas proposal to nasa is carefully optimized to take advantage of the existing @xmath0$1.3  m of detectors , tries to avoid as much hardware risk as possible by using commercial components , and plans for software r&d to be the most costly , difficult , and critical aspect of the project",
    ". however , given time and resources for hardware r&d , it is possible to develop a successor that would have considerably greater  per unit cost than the present atlas implementation .",
    "for example a remarkable set of designs by m. akermann , j.t .",
    "mcgraw , and p.c .",
    "zimmer ( private communication ) include an 0.5  m aperture hamilton astrograph with 1  m focal length and 7  deg fov that achieves 50% encircled energy at 1.5  um radius , i.e. half - energy within a diameter of 0.6 .",
    "the optimal unit camera could have 59  um pixels ( 0.50.2  gpixel total ) for a 11.8  sampling over a field of view of @xmath040  sq  deg .",
    "we note the growing availability of large format detectors , such as the sta-1600 ccd ( www.sta-inc.net ) that has @xmath208k 9  um pixels and can read out at 1 frame per second , canon s recent announcement of an aps - h format ( 29@xmath209  mm ) , 120  mpixel cmos sensor as well as a monolithic 202@xmath95205  mm , high - sensitivity sensor , and advances in back - illuminated cmos detectors by cypress , sony , and others .",
    "it is not inconceivable that improvements in  per unit cost of a factor of three or more might emerge .",
    "we have therefore tried to think of atlas as the start of a `` franchise '' that defines what a hardware and software unit should be , basically a high performance telescope and detector system in a robotic observatory , with common reduction and analysis pipeline and common protocols for communications .",
    "an essential component is bandwidth management  the atlas system has enough local processing to handle the @xmath0100 gb per night of raw data , and depends on extra - observatory bandwidth primarily for trading object catalogs that will be orders of magnitude less information .",
    "the las cumbres observatory global telescope ( brown et al .",
    "2006 ) consists of a widely distributed set of many telescopes that are intended for full - time synoptic coverage of interesting events such as planet occultations or microlensing passages .",
    "wist differs by being dedicated to all - sky , nightly survey and discovery .",
    "wist and lcogt are therefore complementary in their approaches and scientific goals , although both are striving to make the greatest possible use of the silicon revolution and the internet .    because we want to achieve the highest possible hardware and software performance , and also",
    "because we can not cope with the difficulties inherent in a `` national virtual observatory '' that tries to accept information of varying quality and provenance , the `` wist franchise '' would insist on a very high degree of standardization .",
    "this does not mean that a college with poor seeing or bright skies can not participate .",
    "wist is intended to be tolerant of poor seeing , and the standardization allows us to emplace metrics that permit optimal combination of information from all sites .",
    "as the number of observatories grows it would become possible to schedule dynamically according to weather , and to allocate observations by filter or time to different places .",
    "sites with very bright sky backgrounds might be assigned very short exposure times for a more rapid cadence on bright objects , for example .",
    "obviously the search for approaching impactors can be significantly improved by wist , by virtue of closing the southern blind spot , squeezing down the solar blind spot , immunity to weather , and by deeper imagery .",
    "since we intend that the cost of wist be borne by the participants , we expect that all results would be made public immediately",
    ". this will encourage participants to define and carry out projects promptly , and we hope will encourage collaborations . the fact that wist puts",
    "the smallest colleges on the same footing with the most prestigious research universities will serve to foster innovation and reduce the dependence of research achievement on availability of resources .",
    "in this article we have argued that the congressional mandate to nasa to mitigate the hazard from asteroid impact on earth can be parsed temporally as well as by impactor size . to some degree",
    "the risk can never be reduced to zero because orbits are continually perturbed , but we believe that the most important _ time interval _ for discovery of small impactors is just before impact , and we have demonstrated that it is relatively easy and cost - effective to patrol that portion of hazard space .    in order to understand the real capability of survey systems we examined the meaning of `` etendue '' and survey , and derived equations that quantify survey capability both in terms of hardware specifications of aperture , solid angle , efficiency , and image quality , but also in terms of actual performance . in support of this",
    "we also derived an equation that quantifies the image performance in terms of an `` effective noise footprint '' , valid even in the regime of pixels that undersample the psf .",
    "we advanced a description of a new survey instrument , called the `` asteroid terrestrial - impact last alert system '' .",
    "atlas surveys 20,000 sq deg twice per night to magnitude 20 , the sensitivity determined by the practical need for three week s warning of a 100  mton impact , and the solid angle determined by the practical need for immediate warning of a 1  mton impact .",
    "the components for an atlas system are mostly available commercially , the cost is low , and the construction time short .    we compared atlas with the other prominent sky - surveys in operation or being planned , and found that atlas has interesting complementarities to the other surveys that make it particularly potent for early warning of impacts by hazardous objects : it surveys essentially the entire sky at a rapid cadence so the probability of any object slipping through is reasonably low and its sensitivity is high enough to provide a useful warning .",
    "no other survey is as effective for this particular job .",
    "we ended with consideration of a future `` world - wide internet survey telescope '' ( wist ) , comprised of a confederation of many basic observatory units .",
    "the intent is to `` franchise '' the hardware and software design , but at a cost point that makes an observatory unit affordable by essentially any college or university .",
    "this standardization is necessary to allow the full system to be scheduled and for the results of the imagery to be optimally combined , but leads to a system that is virtually unbounded in its ability to explore the time and sensitivity domain of the transient universe .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with christopher stubbs , robert jedicke , armin rest , and john blakeslee .",
