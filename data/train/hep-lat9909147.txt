    "the distribution amplitude @xmath1 gives the probability for finding two collinear partons with fractions @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the meson s momentum  @xcite .",
    "it plays an important role e.g. in exclusive hard scattering processes and in non - leptonic decays of heavy mesons , since it allows one to separate a hard scattering amplitude , computed in perturbation theory , from the effect of the soft fourier modes , whose dynamics is non - perturbative .    for example , the relevant diagram for the pion electromagnetic form factor is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] .",
    "the form factor is defined as : @xmath4 and can be written in terms of the distribution amplitude : @xmath5[{\\mathrm d}y]\\ : \\phi^\\dagger(x , q^2 )   t_h(x , y;q^2 ) \\phi(y , q^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6={\\mathrm d}x_1 { \\mathrm d}x_2 \\delta(x_1+x_2 - 1)$ ] , and @xmath7 is the perturbative amplitude computed at the quark level .",
    "pion    ( 150,75 )    the amplitude @xmath8 is given by the non - local fourier transform of the matrix element of the fermionic bilinear  @xcite : @xmath9 \\label{eq : phidef}\\ ] ] a light - cone expansion relates @xmath8 to fermion bilinears with covariant derivatives . in particular the @xmath10-th moment , @xmath11 can be extracted from the matrix element of the lowest - twist operator appearing in the ope of eq .",
    "[ eq : phidef ] : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the ellipses indicate terms that are proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "the distribution amplitude has been studied in recent years using sum rules ( see results quoted in  @xcite ) and lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the lattice determinations so far has not been good enough to compare precisely with sum rules predictions .",
    "the aim of the current study is to use modern lattice technology to improve the precision of the result .",
    "the following ukqcd quenched configurations have been used to compute the relevant matrix elements .",
    "* @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 lattice ; * sw action , with @xmath18 ; * the three @xmath19 values used in our simulation ( 0.13460 , 0.13510 , 0.13530 ) correspond to physical light pseudoscalar masses ranging from 350 to 850  mev . *",
    "180 configurations are available , the results presented here are based on the analysis of a subset of 129 ; * non - improved local operators have been used , without fuzzing of the light quarks .",
    "in this work , we concentrate on the second moment of the distribution amplitude , i.e. @xmath20 in eq .",
    "[ eq : def1 ] and  [ eq : def2 ] above .",
    "the choice of the lorentz indices for @xmath21 is crucial in order to avoid mixing with lower - dimensional operators .",
    "we choose @xmath22 to be the time - direction .",
    "it is convenient , but not necessary , to avoid time - derivatives and hence we do not symmetrise @xmath22 with @xmath23 . using the notation of  @xcite to classify the irreducible representations of the hypercubic group , we obtain :    * @xmath24}$ ] , with @xmath25 and",
    "symmetrised over @xmath26 and @xmath27 , transforms like a @xmath28 reducible representation , and therefore does not mix with lower dimensional operators .",
    "however the @xmath29 irrep leads to a term proportional to @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 is the fourth available index , which needs to be subtracted in order to have an operator proportional to @xmath32 , as in the continuum limit .",
    "this subtraction is performed in the definition of @xmath33 below .",
    "note that two spatial components of @xmath34 need to be non - zero to get a non - vanishing signal .",
    "* @xmath35 , with @xmath36 transforms like a @xmath37 representation ; however the subtracted operator : @xmath38 simply transforms like @xmath29 . in this case there is no mixing , and a non - zero signal is obtained with just one non - vanishing component of @xmath39 .",
    "the relevant matrix elements are extracted from suitably defined two - point functions . for a generic operator @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .    for large time separations : @xmath43    only the results for the heavier @xmath19 are presented here . the pion propagator is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pionprop ] .",
    "the effective mass and single - exponential fits give consistent results for @xmath44 .",
    "since the relative error on the signal of interest for the second moment becomes large for @xmath45 , the fitting ranges chosen in this work are shorter than the ones usually used for light spectroscopy . despite this discrepancy",
    ", our value for @xmath46 agrees with other ukqcd determinations from the same set of configurations within @xmath47 .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath48 , obtained from 129 configurations , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : r1 ] .",
    "we have currently analysed @xmath33 on 55 configurations only . in order to compare the two determinations ,",
    "the results for @xmath33 are also displayed in the same figure .",
    "the agreement between the two sets of results is good . at this preliminary stage @xmath48 alone",
    "is used to extract our final number .",
    "fitting the points in fig .  [",
    "fig : r1 ] to a constant yields @xmath49 for the lattice value of the second moment of the pion distribution amplitude . the analysis of the complete set of available configurations for both @xmath33 and @xmath48 , together with a full discussion of the systematic errors , will be presented in a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "the statistical error in our result will of course decrease as the number of configurations is increased .",
    "the multiplicative renormalisation of the operator has yet to be calculated , either perturbatively or non - perturbatively .",
    "our preliminary result for the value of @xmath50 suggests that it is lower than the value predicted by sum rules .",
    "such a result could be explained for example by a more peaked distribution for @xmath51 around the origin .",
    "computations of the distribution amplitudes of the @xmath52 meson and the proton are currently under way . our analysis can also be extended to the case of non - degenerate quarks and so a study of the distribution amplitudes of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 mesons is feasible .    9 for a review and extensive references , see v.l .",
