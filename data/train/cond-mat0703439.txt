    "epitaxial ferroelectric batio@xmath0 ( bt ) films have been intensively investigated for their applications in high dielectric layers of capacitors , in dynamic random access memories ( dram ) , microwave integrated circuits , and micro electro mechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite .",
    "nanoscale ferroelectric heterostructures lead to new phenomena .",
    "the physical properties of ferroelectric thin films substantially differ from those of bulk ferroelectrics .",
    "epitaxially grown thin films are usually highly constrained because their fabrication is accompanied by several strain factors such as misfit strain due to lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate or the intermediate buffer layer , thermoelastic strain generated by the difference between the thermal - expansion coefficients ( tecs ) of the film and the substrate , self - strain of the paraelectric - ferroelectric phase transformation if the film is deposited above the curie temperature ( @xmath2 ) , and defects such as dislocations and vacancies , appeared during the deposition .",
    "the effects of internal stresses on the electrical and electromechanical properties have been investigated experimentally and theoretically for a number of ferroelectric systems @xcite .",
    "the experimental investigation of the above - mentioned factors is difficult because the physical properties of real thin films are a combined result of these factors .",
    "therefore , theoretical analysis is important since it can provide fundamental insights into the behavior of thin films .",
    "a phenomenological thermodynamic theory of ferroelectric bt thin films epitaxially grown on cubic substrates was developed @xcite using the landau - devonshire six - order potential as a polynomial of the polarization components .",
    "for single - domain batio@xmath0 film , the `` misfit - temperature '' phase diagram was constructed .",
    "it was found that the two - dimensional ( 2d ) clamping of the film , apart from a shift of the temperature of the ferroelectric transition , changes the entire phase diagram , creating new phases that are not present in bulk crystals . for bt thin films",
    "epitaxially grown on cubic substrates pertsev _ et al _",
    "@xcite have predicted five distinct stable phases .",
    "four of them , namely @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and r have a common multiphase point on the diagram at zero misfit strain and temperature equal to the @xmath2 of the bulk material .",
    "later @xcite , another phase diagram was proposed for bt film using another set of coefficients in the same six - order thermodynamic potential . in the vicinity of @xmath2 and small misfit strains ,",
    "the phase diagram is quite similar to the previous one , except the low - temperature range where the 2d clamping stabilizes mainly the @xmath6-phase and not the @xmath7 one .",
    "recent first principle calculations @xcite qualitatively confirmed the latter finding and general view of the phase diagram .",
    "however , according to @xcite the multiphase point has a positive shift along the misfit strain axis .",
    "the misfit - temperature phase diagram constructed in @xcite , is based on the six - order thermodynamic potential with the temperature - dependent coefficients @xcite , which reproduces quite well the low - temperature ferroelectric phase transitions in bt single crystal .",
    "it is worth noting that the 2d clamping increases considerably the ferroelectric phase transition temperature in perovskite thin films . in this case , the coefficient at the sixth - order term in thermodynamic potential becomes negative ; therefore , the six - order expansion is not valid for high - temperature phase transitions in thin films . to overcome the problem ,",
    "high - order terms should be included . in this paper",
    "we employed an eighth - order polynomial for the landau - devonshire potential of bulk bt single crystal @xcite under mechanical stress - free boundary conditions , only the first coefficient at @xmath8 is temperature dependent , while others are independent of temperature .",
