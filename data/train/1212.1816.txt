    "this singularity imposes on the @xmath3 s a very interesting behavior , described by theorems [ thm8 ] and [ mainthm ] below .",
    "we emphasize that the nature of this singularity sparks purely from geometric considerations .    two essential components to describe the behavior of @xmath3 on the interior of @xmath95 are the mbius transformation @xmath109 and the doubly infinite series @xmath110 defined by @xmath111    for the curve @xmath12 given by ( [ eq118 ] ) , the exterior conformal map @xmath29 of @xmath25 onto @xmath22 is given by @xmath112 and the composition @xmath108 maps the region @xmath113 in a two - to - one fashion onto the interior of @xmath95 ( see figure [ regiond ] ) .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath16 for @xmath114 in the interior of @xmath95 take a simpler and more elegant form if they are stated instead on the region @xmath115 by means of the functions @xmath116    hereafter the fractional part of a number @xmath117 will be denoted by @xmath118 .",

    "the type of singularity encountered by the function @xmath146 of our example seems to occur with frequency .",
    "this is a consequence of the meromorphic continuation properties that @xmath146 displays in general , as explained in propositions 4 , 5 and 6 of @xcite .",
    "such is the case , for instance , of the level curve @xmath147 ( for @xmath148 , this curve is the hypocycloid of three cusps ) .",

    "for a fixed value of @xmath2 , let @xmath12 be given by ( [ eq118 ] ) . from very well - known properties of the zhukovsky transformation @xmath158 , it follows that @xmath12 is an analytic jordan curve , and that the function @xmath24 given by ( [ mapping ] ) maps @xmath25 conformally onto the exterior @xmath22 of @xmath12 .",
