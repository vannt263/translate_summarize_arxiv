    "cosmic strings are linear concentrations of energy with a cosmological size , which appear in several high - energy physics scenarios and may have a variety of cosmological and astrophysical consequences  @xcite .",
    "field theory cosmic strings have been abundantly studied since the 70 s  @xcite .",
    "the subject has been recently regenerated by the progressive realization  @xcite that cosmic strings occur also as fundamental objects of string theory , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "these so - called cosmic super - strings are expected to be produced in particular at the end of brane inflation  @xcite or at hagedorn phase transitions  @xcite after inflation  @xcite .",
    "this opens the opportunity that they could lead to observational signatures of string theory , if these signatures can be distinguished to some degree from the ones of traditional field theory cosmic strings .",
    "properties of cosmic super - strings that may help this distinction , although they appear also in some field theory models , include the possibilities of reconnection probabilities smaller than unity and of strings with different charges and junctions between them . in this paper , we consider another potentially specific aspect of cosmic super - strings : their interactions with massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes associated with the compact extra dimensions .",
    "we will study in particular the production of kk particles by cosmic super - strings  @xcite .",
    "the extra dimensions play a crucial role for cosmic super - strings , being responsible for making their tension small enough compared to the planck scale , as required by observations .",
    "this can be achieved in two different ways  @xcite .",
    "the first possibility is to have cosmic strings localized at the bottom of a warped ten - dimensional geometry , called throat , where the effective four - dimensional scales are `` redshifted '' by a warp factor that depends on the position in the internal space  @xcite .",
    "this occurs in particular in models of warped brane inflation  @xcite with stabilized moduli  @xcite , which currently represent one of the most popular class of inflationary models in string theory . in these models ,",
    "the effective string tension @xmath1 in units of the four - dimensional newton constant @xmath2 is exponentially small because of the value @xmath3 of the warp factor at the bottom of the throat , @xmath4 . in that case , the lowest - lying kk modes are lighter than the string scale @xmath5 because their masses are also suppressed by the warp factor @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , their wave - function in the extra - dimensions is localized at the bottom of the throat , where the cosmic strings are located ( see fig .  [ throatcy ] ) . as a result ,",
    "their coupling to the cosmic strings is enhanced by the factor @xmath7 with respect to the gravitational coupling .",
    "thus these kk modes are relatively strongly coupled to the cosmic super - strings .",
    "the second possibility is to have a flat internal space with a large six - dimensional volume  @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fundamental string length , so that @xmath10 . in that case , the kk modes couple only gravitationally to the cosmic strings , but there is now a dense spectrum of modes with masses much smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "thus a lot of these kk modes can then be produced . whether kk modes are strongly coupled or very light , they can be efficiently produced by cosmic super - strings in both cases .",
    "the tension of cosmic super - strings is highly model - dependent , depending in particular on the values of @xmath11 and @xmath6 and on the energy scale at which the cosmic strings form . for cosmic super - strings produced at the end of brane inflation ,",
    "the tension depends on the inflationary energy scale , which in turn is constrained by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . in models of brane inflation",
    "where the cmb anisotropies are generated only by the quantum fluctuations of a single inflaton field , the string tension is expected to be in the approximate ranges @xmath12 for a flat internal space with large volume  @xcite and @xmath13 for a warped throat  @xcite .",
    "the gravitational effects of such cosmic strings may be observable in the near future , in particular with upcoming gravitational wave ( gw ) experiments  @xcite .",
    "in general , however , cosmic super - strings may have a much smaller tension .",
    "this occurs in particular when they are produced in models of brane inflation at lower energy scales .",
    "indeed these models have now been generalized in a number of ways and the cmb anisotropies may be generated from quantum fluctuations of other fields , like e.g. in the curvaton  @xcite and modulated reheating  @xcite scenarios .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that the conformal - coupling problem of the original model of warped brane inflation  @xcite can be made harmless if inflation occurs at low energy scales , as low as the tev scale .",
    "this leads to cosmic super - strings with tensions as small as @xmath14 .",
    "the tension of cosmic super - strings is also relatively small when they form at hagedorn phase transitions  @xcite after inflation .",
    "for instance , if one throat is present in the internal space , then it is maybe more typical to have several of them , which also offers more opportunities to naturally generate several hierarchies . in these multi - throat scenarios , cosmic super - strings",
    "are produced in long throats that are heated above their local hagedorn temperature after inflation  @xcite .",
    "these can be much lighter than the inflationary energy scale . because the gravitational effects of such light cosmic strings are much weaker , it is crucial to look for their other possible signatures , in particular the production of ( massive ) particles .",
    "there are at least three general motivations to look for particle production by cosmic strings ( besides gravitational waves ) , depending on the model and on the nature of these particles .",
    "first , the particles produced by strings may have useful cosmological consequences , e.g. for baryogenesis  @xcite , ultra - high energy cosmic rays  @xcite , or the non - thermal production of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "secondly , these particles may lead instead to cosmological problems , and therefore to constraints on the cosmic string parameters , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "finally , particle production may affect both the dissipation of small scale structure on the long strings and the rate at which the loops shrink , hence the predictions for other cosmic string signatures .",
    "the production of massive particles by field theory cosmic strings has been studied by several authors .",
    "@xcite considered a scalar field with a quartic interaction with cosmic strings and studied its production from cusps - highly boosted regions where the string doubles back on itself . refs .  @xcite considered instead trilinear interactions , which make particle production more efficient and may occur when a scalar field condenses on the string or for strongly coupled moduli fields .",
    "the production of gravitationally coupled moduli fields was studied in @xcite .",
    "besides these perturbative processes of particle production , cosmic strings also emit quanta of their constituent fields when string segments annihilate .",
    "this occurs in particular at cusps on usual abelian - higgs cosmic strings , as first suggested in @xcite and revisited in detail in @xcite .",
    "massive particles may also be copiously produced in more complicated models , e.g. when the cosmic strings are super - conducting  @xcite .",
    "cosmic super - strings , on the other hand , are more likely to be stable if they are somehow decoupled from other degrees of freedom , in particular from the standard model fields  @xcite .",
    "the kind of particles they can emit is therefore more constrained  .",
    "however , they always couple to the ten - dimensional metric . from the four - dimensional point of view , this generically includes , beyond the ubiquitous four - dimensional massless graviton , a tower of relatively light kk modes associated with the geometry of the extra dimensions .    in a recent letter  @xcite",
    ", we studied the production of kk modes by cosmic super - strings in a warped throat , showing that it is contrained by the photo - dissociation of the light elements produced by big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "these constraints rule out regions of the parameter space of cosmic super - strings that are complemetary to the ones that can be probed by gw experiments .",
    "in the present paper , we give a full computation of these results .",
    "in addition to  @xcite , we also consider cosmic super - strings located in a flat internal space with large volume , we study the constraints on kk emission coming from observations of the diffuse gamma ray background , and we discuss the effects of kk modes on the early , friction - dominated stage of cosmic super - string evolution .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ coupling ] , we consider the spectrum of kk modes and their coupling to cosmic f- and d - strings .",
    "we then study the emission of kk modes by cosmic string loops in section  [ emission ] .",
    "section  [ distribution ] is dedicated to the consequences of kk emission for the loop number density and the effect of the friction - dominated epoch for cosmic super - strings .",
    "we then address cosmological consequences of kk emission and constraints on the cosmic string parameters in section  [ constraints ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclu ] with a summary of our results and directions for future work . an appendix is dedicated to computational aspects of the emission of massive particles by cusps .",
    "in this section , we discuss the spectrum of kk modes and their coupling to cosmic f- and d - strings . as discussed in the introduction , cosmic super - strings may live either at the bottom of a warped ten - dimensional geometry or in a flat internal space with large volume .",

    "relatively few kk modes are lighter than the string scale , but they are strongly coupled to the cosmic strings . in the case of a flat internal space with large volume , the kk modes are only gravitationally coupled , but many of them are very light . we found that the total energy emitted by cusps in kk modes is comparable in both cases .",
    "it is also comparable ( up to a numerical factor of order unity that depends on the string coupling @xmath24 and on the compactification details ) to the energy emitted in scalar and gauge fields by cusp annihilation on standard abelian - higgs cosmic strings .",

    "the constraints depend also on the typical size of the loops when they are produced , on the way the loop number density varies with @xmath197 , and to a lesser degree on the average number of cusps per loop oscillation .",
    "these properties of cosmic strings are still uncertain and can hopefully be determined by the next generation of simulations .",
    "we expect however our main conclusion - the complementarity between kk and gw emissions in probing the parameter space of cosmic super - strings - to be qualitatively robust .",
    "this may ultimately allow to constrain or determine fundamental parameters of string theory , such as the string coupling @xmath24 and the compactification details .",
    "we have only considered kk modes that correspond to spin-@xmath0 fields in four dimensions , because these are the most generic ones , and we calculated their production within the regime of validity of the effective nambu - goto description .",
    "in general , however , other kk modes may be produced too .",
    "furthermore , beyond the nambu - goto description , one may expect cusps to emit string states , which would then decay into extra kk modes",
    ". it would be interesting to study this process in string theory , see @xcite for recent developments in this direction .",
    "if more kk modes are produced , this may widen the ranges of string tensions that are constrained by kk emission towards larger values .    that kk emission leads to constraints in a range of string tensions , as opposed to just a lower or an upper bound , comes from the following reason . for large string tensions , the loops decay relatively quickly by gravitational emission , so their number density is relatively small . as the tension decreases , the lifetime of the loops increases , and thus also their number density , leading to a larger energy density emitted in kk modes and therefore to stronger cosmological consequences .",
    "however , for sufficiently small values of the string tension , the lifetime of the loops starts being dominated by kk emission and becomes shorter . further decreasing",
    "the tension then decreases the loop number density and the energy density emitted in kk modes , so that the constraints eventually disappear .",
    "it was therefore important for us to carefully take into account the effects of kk emission on the loop number density .",
    "these effects are important mainly for small string tensions or in the very early universe .",
    "we only presented here the modifications of the loop number density in the regimes of interest in this paper , leaving a more complete analysis and the discussion of other cosmological consequences for future work .",
    "we have followed the standard expectation that , except potentially in the very early universe , the cosmic super - strings are localized at a classically fixed position in the internal space  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the gw signal emitted from cusps is reduced if the cosmic strings can move in a flat internal space . in that case",
    ", kk emission would be suppressed too .",
    "this would presumably also lead to very small reconnection probabilities .",
    "however , as emphasized in @xcite , the position of the strings in the internal space corresponds to worldsheet moduli that are not protected by any symmetry and should therefore be fixed at the minimum of their effective potential . in that case , there is no classical motion of the strings in the extra - dimensions , but the reconnection probability is reduced by the quantum fluctuations of the strings in the internal space .",
    "it was also found in ref .  @xcite that , given initial conditions for the string motion and a warp factor generating an effective potential for their position , hubble damping may not be efficient enough to localize the strings in the internal space after their production .",
    "we note however that other mechanisms of damping may be more efficient .",
    "as we have mentioned several times , kk modes are also abundantly produced when the cosmic strings form , either thermally or as the decay products of brane / anti - brane annihilation .",
    "similarly to the friction - dominated epoch for field theory cosmic strings , we therefore expect the cosmic super - strings interacting with this thermal gas of kk modes to experience a friction force that can stabilize their position in the internal space and damp their motion in the non - compact dimensions .",

    "<S> cosmic super - strings interact generically with a tower of relatively light and/or strongly coupled kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes associated with the geometry of the internal space . in this paper , we study the production of spin-@xmath0 kk particles by cusps on loops of cosmic f- and d - strings . </S>",
    "<S> we consider cosmic super - strings localized either at the bottom of a warped throat or in a flat internal space with large volume . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy emitted by cusps in kk modes is comparable in both cases , although the number of produced kk modes may differ significantly . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that kk emission is constrained by the photo - dissociation of light elements and by observations of the diffuse gamma ray background . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this rules out regions of the parameter space of cosmic super - strings that are complementary to the regions that can be probed by current and upcoming gravitational wave experiments . </S>",
