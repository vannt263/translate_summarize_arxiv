    "latest measurements of relativistic electron flux in the outer radiation belt , fulfilled by two van - allen probes in high apogee orbit , gave new very important information about the behavior of high - energy electron ensemble in the outer belt @xcite .",
    "on the basis of this observation it is asserted that there is the local structure of outer radiation belt with a large variability .",
    "in particular it was noted that the third radiation belt was formed in the outer magnetosphere at the beginning of september 2012 .",
    "it is also necessary to mention the latest measurements of outer belt electron flux by proba - v satellite in the low earth polar orbit since may 2013 .",
    "deep dropout of electron flux at l@xmath14 was observed by ept instrument onboard this satellite during the main phase of big geomagnetic storm event on 17 march 2015 @xcite .",
    "russian satellite arina experiment , aimed to study fast variations of high - energy electron and proton fluxes in the magnetosphere , was carried out in low earth orbit since 2006 till 2016 @xcite .",

    "the arina scintillation spectrometer developed by the mephi detects and identifies electrons ( 3 - 30 mev ) and protons ( 30 - 100 mev ) , measures particle energies , and allows to study the energy spectra and time profiles of particle fluxes .",
    "the arina experiments was carried out on board the low - orbital resurs - dk1 satellite @xcite with altitude of 350 - 600 km and an orbit inclination of 70@xmath2 .",
    "the experiment was executed since mid - june 2006 till january 2016 .",
    "local pitch - angles of particles during the measurements were closed to 90@xmath2 .",
    "the multilayer scintillation detector ( ten scintillation layers ) is main part of the instrument .",
    "charged particles ( electrons , protons ) move in the instrument aperture , defining by three first segmented layers , sequentially pass through scintillation layers , lose energy , and are absorbed in the detector .",
    "particles passed through the entire instrument are cut by last bottom layer of detector operating in the anticoincidence mode .",
    "thus , particles stopped in the multilayer detector are electrons with energies of 3 - 30 mev and protons with energies of 30 - 100 mev .",
    "particles are identified by the energy release in each scintillation layer when they passing through the instrument in combination of particle range in detector layers .",
    "the electron and proton energies are measured by their range in detector . the physics scheme and performances of the arina instrument",
    "are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the arina instrument give the possibility to measure the energy spectra of particles with 10%-15% energy resolution and to trace spectra evolution , to determine time profiles of particle flux variations with high time resolution and can operate in high - intensity particle fluxes in the radiation belts or during power solar proton events the instrument acceptance controlled by the configuration and arrangement of three top detector layers is about 10 @xmath3sr .",
    "at that instrument field of view is about 20@xmath2 and angular resolution within 7@xmath2 - 10@xmath2 .",
    "the main objective of experiments is the study of high - energy charged particle bursts of solar and geophysical origin in the inner zone of magnetosphere @xcite . in this work we used the arina experimental data on the high - energy electron flux in the energy range of 4 - 6 mev in the outer radiation belt .",
    "it is known that geomagnetic disturbances are one of the most important factors , defining the behavior of outer radiation belt .",
    "below we consider high - energy electron flux in zones of outer radiation belt and slot between inner and outer belts on example of one month and note main features in behavior of electron flux under different magnetospheric conditions .",
    "1 presents dst variation during march 2012 . most large geomagnetic storm on 9 - 10 march led to formation long - lived high - energy electron belt in zone of outer radiation belt .",
    "the slot region at l=2.5 - 2.7 ( fig .",
    "2 ) is usually insensitive to magnetospheric disturbances ( even large one ) .",
    "but sometimes under specific conditions this region can be also fill by high - energy electrons forming long - lived belts @xcite .",
