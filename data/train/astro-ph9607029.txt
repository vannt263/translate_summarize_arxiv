    "to extract the surface brightness profiles we use rosat / pspc data in the band , omitting point sources . for ngc5044",
    "we also exclude a region 2  south - south - east of the center , where a surface brightness enhancement was detected previously ( d94 ) . to calculate asca / sis arf matrix",
    ", we make a 3-dimensional model of the source based on results of rosat profile analysis , using a @xmath1-model , and assuming spherical symmetry . for ngc5846 and ngc4649 the second component of the beta fits",
    "is significant .",
    "details are described in ffj96 , where it is also shown that our procedure is not affected by variation of rosat / pspc count rate with temperature .",
    "analysis of the hardness ratio shows , except for the ngc5044 feature noted , that the temperature distribution is symmetrical around the center .",
    "for the spectral fitting of rosat data , we used the band and for the asca / sis data .",
    "absorption was taken as the galactic value . the mekal model ( from xspec-9.0 package ) was used in the spectral modeling with abundances from ag89 .",
    "the spectrum of the core region ( @xmath21 ) is complex due to the presence of cooling gas , so we present only the temperature .",
    "high abundances of si , s and fe in ngc5044 group compared to the two ellipticals , suggest that more of the heavily enriched gas , produced at early epochs , was bound by the deeper group potential than by that of the individual galaxies .",
    "a total mass of si , s and fe , inside 300 kpc from ngc5044 center is 0.9 ( 0.41.6 ) , 0.5 ( 0.20.9 ) , 2.9 ( 2.24.7 ) of @xmath3 , respectively with total gas mass of @xmath4 . the mass ratio of fe to si is larger then predicted on the onset of the galactic wind ( mt87 ) and the data favors presence of the `` outflow phase '' in the galactic history . abundances of si , s and fe , observed in ngc4649 and ngc5846 , are determined by snia output and stellar mass loss .",
    "while snia supply mainly fe , a ratio of si to fe in stars at the radius involved is not well known .",
    "so far , in order to explain the very presence of the optical abundance gradients a shorter time of star formation with increasing radii is assumed ( cdb93 ) , one can argue , that the impact from snii explosions from more massive progenitors prevail at the outer radius , which is characterized by higher si and s to fe ratio ( ww86 ) .",
    "nevertheless , an upper limit on snia output can be set by ascribing all the observed fe to the snia .",
    "taking snia rate slope s=1.4 and initial time of the `` inflow phase '' equal to 9  gyr ( krm model in c91 ) , an observed fe / fe@xmath5 abundance value of 0.5 corresponds to current sn ia rate values of 0.2 of tammann rate ( for details see ffj96 ) .",
    "low mass of fe , observed in ngc4649 , could be ascribed to the effects of ram pressure ablation .",
