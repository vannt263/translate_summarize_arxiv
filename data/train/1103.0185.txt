    "one of the most successful techniques for investigating artificial nano - structures , such as integrated molecules or gated quantum dots , is the measurement of the electron flow through the structure from a source to a drain contact . in this field",
    ", there has been an enormous progress in the experimental realization since the first measurements of electric currents through molecules @xcite or quantum dots @xcite more then a decade ago .",
    "thereby , it has been successfully demonstrated that current measurements provide information equivalent to the traditional spectroscopy of atoms or molecules in the gas phase @xcite . in recent years , the possibility to inject ultra - fast voltage pulses into nano - devices paved the way to perform transport measurements beyond steady - state paradigms .",
    "this approach is particularly promising for two reasons : firstly , transient relaxation processes can be measured directly in the time domain @xcite . secondly , the external control of the pulses can be used to manipulate the electronic dynamics in quantum - dot systems @xcite , which may eventually be used to realize quantum gates @xcite . in either case",
    "an explicit time - dependent theoretical description of the ultra - fast dynamical response is mandatory for interpreting time - resolved data .",
    "further , it would possibly allow to develop new manipulation schemes for nanoscale devices .    addressing these challenges",
    "there has been considerable progress towards having real - time methods for the description of electron transport .",
    "many of these are based on non - equilibrium green functions ( negf ) @xcite .",
    "hereby , electron - electron interaction is either fully neglected or approximately taken into account by means of self - energies obtained from many - body perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach for strongly interacting systems is given by considering the time evolution of the ( reduced ) many - particle density matrix @xcite .",
    "as in the theory of open quantum systems @xcite , one studies the reduced density matrix describing exclusively the degrees of freedom of a particular sub - system ( here the nano - device ) which is embedded in a larger system containing an environment ( here the contacts ) . instead of the bosonic environment of a system coupled to a heat bath , the nano - device is coupled to thermal fermionic reservoirs through source and drain contacts .",
    "the tunnel coupling of these contacts to the system leads to an exchange of electrons with the reservoirs , and thus to an electric current through the device .",
    "this current , as well as related quantities like level occupations , can be determined by means of the reduced density matrix @xcite .",
    "its time evolution is given by so - called ( generalized ) quantum master equations ( qme ) , in which typically the coupling to the environment is incorporated in a perturbative description , often in second order .",
    "in this article , we present a propagation scheme which allows for an efficient real - time description of nano - systems with arbitrary time - dependences of any parameter of the system and the contacts , such as level energies , tunnel couplings , or voltages .",
    "we discuss a _ fourth - order method _ , which serves two purposes : firstly , it shows corrections beyond the `` standard description '' with second - order schemes @xcite .",
    "secondly , it devices a method for summing up certain terms up to infinitely many orders .",
    "thereby , the broadening of system levels due to the coupling to the contacts is properly taken into account , which is shown to be crucial for obtaining meaningful results from solving qmes in the time domain .",
    "additionally , we propose the application of _ auxiliary density operators _ by which the calculation of the time evolution is reduced to the propagation of coupled differential equations containing only quantities with one time argument @xcite . by means of a recently proposed partial fraction decomposition of the fermi function @xcite",
    "the number of equations to be propagated is considerably smaller than in previous implementations of the auxiliary - operator method @xcite .    in the following",
    "we define the setup of system , contacts and their coupling by giving the corresponding hamilton operators . in sect .",
    "[ sec : densitymatrix ] we summarize the derivation of the qme for the reduced density matrix up to fourth order .",

    "accordingly , the total hamiltonian can be split into three parts , @xmath0 the device hamiltonian @xmath1 is characterized by discrete levels @xmath2 which may be coupled through @xmath3 as , e.g. , levels from different parts in a quantum dot system . in eq .",
    "and below the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the creation and annihilation of an electron in state @xmath6 .",
    "electron - electron interactions in the device are accounted for by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "its particular form depends on the application ; for example a common choice in the context of quantum dots is given by @xmath8 here , the matrix @xmath9 accounts for intra and inter - dot interactions , if the labels @xmath10 and @xmath6 belong to the same or different quantum dots , respectively .",
    "the reservoir hamiltonian @xmath11 describes non - interacting electrons in the left ( @xmath12 ) and right ( @xmath13 ) contact .",
    "the respective tunneling hamiltonian is given by    [ eq : tunnham]@xmath14    with @xmath15 denoting the couplings between device and reservoir .",
    "the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 are electron creation and annihilation operators for reservoir states .",
    "the abbreviations are sums of reservoir operators which will be convenient later on .",
    "in general , as emphasized by the time arguments , all levels and couplings may explicitly depend on time through the variation of source , drain or gate voltages .    in order to simplify the notation we will use a compact multi - index notation in the following .",
    "thereby , the multi - index @xmath18 encloses the operator type , either annihilation or creation operator , @xmath19 , contact label @xmath20 , and system state @xmath21 .",

    "we have anticipated the vanishing of the odd order cumulants due to our choice of the initial density operator , which will be discussed below .",

    "it has been shown @xcite how this expansion can be connected to a diagrammatic description @xcite , which provides a clearer interpretation in terms of tunneling processes . however , for practical calculations one usually considers only the second order qme .",
    "this is mainly due to the complicated structure of nested integrals in eq .  .",
    "in the following we will provide explicit expressions of the second and fourth - order kernels and in next section we will show how an _ auxiliary operator method _ can be utilized to deal with the integrals .",

    "therefore , taking the initial time to the infinite past , the qme description corresponds to the scheme introduced by caroli and co - workers @xcite .    the second order memory kernel in terms of system and reservoir operators is explicitly given by the following commutator @xcite @xmath50_-}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the reservoir correlation functions @xmath51 due to the fermionic character of the @xmath52-operators , there are only two possible types of correlation functions    [ eq : typescorrfun]@xmath53    which we can identify with the lesser and greater tunneling self - energies appearing in the negf formalism , cf .  eqs .  .",
