    "dissipation of energy by radiation is a fundamental phenomenon which is responsible for the asymptotic stabilization of solutions of extended hamiltonian systems . in particular , for dispersive wave equations defined on spatially unbounded domains , the relaxation to a stationary equilibrium is due to the radiation of excess energy to infinity .",
    "this happens in various physical situations , for example in the gravitational collapse to a stationary black hole .",
    "notwithstanding their physical significance , the mathematical understanding of dissipation - by - dispersion phenomena is very limited , especially in the non - perturbative regime where initial data are not close to the final equilibrium . in order to gain insight into this kind of phenomena in real physical situations",
    ", it is instructive to study them in toy models .",
    "this was the motivation of a model introduced in @xcite : equivariant wave maps whose domain is the flat spacetime exterior to a timelike cylinder and the target is the three - sphere . by mixed analytical and numerical methods",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in each topological sector there exists a unique stationary solution ( harmonic map ) which serves as the global attractor in the evolution for any finite - energy smooth initial data .",
    "recently , this conjecture was proved by kenig , lawrie , and schlag @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite is very simple but rather artificial geometrically . in this paper",
    "we introduce a similar model , also involving the equivariant wave maps into the three - sphere , but with a geometrically natural domain , namely a wormhole - type spacetime . in this model",
    "we give evidence for the analogous soliton resolution conjecture as in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we employ here the hyperboloidal formulation of the initial value problem as developed by zenginolu @xcite on the basis of concepts introduced by friedrich @xcite and frauendiener @xcite .",
    "the dissipation of energy by dispersion is inherently incorporated in the hyperboloidal formulation which makes this approach ideally suited for studying relaxation to static solutions . in particular",
    ", it allows us to describe the _ pointwise _ convergence to the attractor on the _ entire _ spatial hypersurfaces , including the null infinity .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we introduce our model .",
    "we prove the existence of harmonic maps in section  3 and study their linear stability in section  4 . in section  5",
    "we describe the hyperboloidal formulation of the initial value problem and formulate the main conjecture .",
    "the numerical evidence supporting this conjecture is presented in section  6 .",
    "a map @xmath0 from a spacetime @xmath1 into a riemannian manifold @xmath2 is said to be the wave map if it is a critical point of the action @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are local coordinates on @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "variation of the action yields the system of semilinear wave equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wave operator associated with the metric @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the christoffel symbols of the target metric @xmath12 .    as the domain @xmath1 we take an ultrastatic spherically symmetric spacetime with @xmath13 and the metric @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a positive constant .",
    "this spacetime is a prototype example of the wormhole geometry with two asymptotically flat ends at @xmath16 connected by a spherical throat ( minimal surface ) of area @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "it was first considered by ellis @xcite and bronnikov @xcite and later popularized by morris and thorne as a tool for interstellar travel @xcite .",
    "note that the metric does not obey einstein s equations @xmath19 with a physically reasonable stress - energy tensor , because , due to @xmath20 , the energy density of matter is negative .    as the target @xmath2",
    "we take the three - sphere with the round metric and parametrize it by spherical coordinates @xmath21 @xmath22 in addition , we assume that the map @xmath23 is spherically @xmath24-equivariant , that is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a harmonic eigenmap map with eigenvalue @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . under these assumptions",

    "time - independent solutions @xmath41 of eq .",
    "satisfy the ordinary differential equation @xmath42 in order to analyze solutions of this equation , it is convenient to introduce new variables , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in terms of which equation becomes @xmath45 this equation can be interpreted as the equation of motion for the unit mass particle moving in the potential @xmath46 and subject to damping with the time - dependent damping coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "the harmonic map of degree @xmath35 corresponds to the trajectory whose projection on the phase plane @xmath48 starts from the saddle point @xmath49 at @xmath50 and goes to the saddle point @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of such a connecting trajectory for each @xmath35 follows from an elementary shooting argument .",
    "for example , let the particle be located at @xmath53 for @xmath54 . if the velocity @xmath55 is too small , then the particle will never reach the hilltop at @xmath56 , while if @xmath57 is sufficiently large it will reach @xmath56 in finite time with nozero velocity . by continuity , there must be a critical velocity @xmath58 for which the particle reaches the hilltop in infinite time . from the reflection symmetry",
    "@xmath59 , the particle sent backwards in time reaches @xmath60 for @xmath61 , giving the desired connecting trajectory with @xmath62 . repeating this argument for higher @xmath35 we get a countable family of connecting trajectories @xmath63 which are symmetric with respect to the midpoint @xmath64 , that is @xmath65 .",

    "unfortunately , the connection problem for the heun equation remains unsolved and the coefficients @xmath84 are not known explicitly so we must resort to a numerical computation .",
    "the difficulty is that for @xmath85 the ingoing wave is exponentially small for large @xmath86 and therefore very hard to be tracked down numerically .",
    "however , maple is able to evaluate the confluent heun function in the whole complex @xmath86-plane which allows us to impose the quantization condition along a rotated ray @xmath87 where the ingoing solution is dominant @xcite .",
    "since @xmath88 depends on @xmath89 , this approach in principle requires a careful examination of stokes lines and branch cuts but in practice ( especially when we know the quasinormal frequency approximately , for example from dynamical evolution or the wkb approximation ) , the range of angles @xmath88 for which the procedure is convergent can be easily determined empirically .",
    "the quasinormal frequencies obtained in this manner are given in the first two rows in table  ii .",
    "the above method is not applicable for @xmath90 because the harmonic maps @xmath91 are not known explicitly .",
    "in this situation the simplest way to get the two least damped quasinormal frequencies is to solve eq . numerically ( for even and odd initial data , respectively ) and then fit an exponentially damped sinusoid to @xmath92 at some fixed @xmath93 over a suitably chosen interval of intermediate times ( after the direct signal from the data has passed through @xmath93 but before the polynomial tail has unfolded ) .",
    "the results are shown in table  ii .",
    "notice that for @xmath90 the fundamental quasinormal modes are very weakly damped .",
    "this is due to the deep single well ( for odd @xmath35 ) and double well ( for even @xmath35 ) in the potential @xmath94 ( see fig .  2 ) . as @xmath24 increases , the outer barriers of these potential wells increase and consequently the damping rates of fundamental quasinormal modes tend to zero .",

    "we want to solve the cauchy problem for eq . for finite - energy smooth initial data ( @xmath107 ) . as mentioned above",
    ", the global - in - time regularity is not an issue : all solutions that are smooth initially remain smooth forever and enjoy the bondi - type expansions near the future null infinities @xmath100 and @xmath98 @xmath108 multiplying eq .",
    "by @xmath109 we get the local conservation law @xmath110 where @xmath111 defining the bondi - type energy @xmath112 and integrating eq . over a hypersurface @xmath96",
    "one gets the energy balance ( where @xmath113 ) @xmath114 we shall refer to @xmath115 and @xmath116 as the radiation coefficients .",
    "the formula expresses the loss of energy due to radiation through @xmath100 and @xmath98 .",
    "since the energy @xmath117 is positive and monotone decreasing , it has a nonnegative limit for @xmath118 .",
    "it is natural to expect that this limit is given by the energy of a static endstate of evolution .",
    "this leads us to :    for any degree @xmath35 smooth initial data there exists a unique global smooth solution @xmath119 which converges pointwise to the harmonic map @xmath120 as @xmath118 .    in the remainder of the paper",

    "one can clearly distinguish three stages of evolution : ( i ) the direct signal from the initial data , ( ii ) the intermediate stage dominated by the quasinormal ringdown , and ( iii ) the final stage dominated by the polynomial decay ( tail ) .",
    "the quasinormal ringdown is a well understood linear phenomenon . for general initial data",
    "it is dominated by the fundamental quasinormal mode .",
    "as mentioned above , this mode is damped very weakly for @xmath90 and therefore it takes very long before a tail uncovers , especially for large values of @xmath24 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "a simple way to shorten the duration of ringdown is to take odd initial data . since eq .",
    "is invariant under reflection @xmath137 , the parity of solutions is preserved in the evolution , hence for odd initial data the ringdown is governed by the least damped odd quasinormal mode . as shown in table  2 , this mode ( labelled by the index @xmath138 ) is damped much faster than the fundamental mode which makes odd data convenient in the study of tails .",
    "6 illustrates how one can use the dependence of damping rates of quasinormal modes on parity to control the ringdown .     and two values of @xmath139 .",

    "initially , the ringdown is governed by the first odd quasinormal mode which is rapidly decaying . for later times , the fundamental , slowly decaying , even quasinormal mode takes over.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we turn now to the description of the final stage of evolution , the polynomial tail .",
    "the late - time tails for equivariant wave maps from minkowski and nearly minkowski spacetimes into the 3-sphere were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was found there that the dominant contribution to the tail does not come from the linear backscattering off the effective potential but from the cubic nonlinearity ( in the expansion of the sine function ) . in other words ,",
    "the tail is _ nonlinear _ at the leading order .",
    "more precisely , it follows from @xcite ( see eqs.(36 ) and ( 46 ) there ) that for solutions of eq . on @xmath142 with @xmath30 ( i.e. minkowski domain ) starting from topologically trivial compactly supported small initial data the tail for @xmath37 and all @xmath142 is given by @xmath143 where the constants @xmath144 depend on initial data .",
    "it is natural to expect that the formulae provide good approximations to the tails ( both the profiles and decay rates ) in the asymptotically flat regions of the wormhole spacetime where @xmath145 , independently of @xmath35 . outside of these asymptotic regions the profiles are of course different",
    ", however the decay rates should be the same at all interior points @xmath146 , namely as follows from @xmath147 where the constants @xmath148 depend on initial data and @xmath136 .",
