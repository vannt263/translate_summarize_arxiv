    "hydroxyl ( oh ) masers are common in massive star - forming regions ( sfrs ) .",
    "their small size and large zeeman splitting coefficient allow them to serve as probes of the velocity and magnetic fields on a very small scale . because oh masers often cluster together in large numbers on subarcsecond scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) techniques are required to identify individual maser features .",
    "due both to this close clustering of maser spots and to the tendency for the two components of a ground - state zeeman pair to have highly unequal fluxes @xcite , the resolution afforded by vlbi is necessary in order to identify most zeeman pairs ( see , for instance , * ? ? ? * ) . likewise , identifying individual maser spots in a cluster is a prerequisite to understanding the linear polarization of oh masers , since blending of the linear polarization from adjacent masers with different polarization properties can corrupt the interpretation of the polarization .    over a quarter century",
    "has passed since the first oh maser source was observed with vlbi resolution : w3(oh ) by @xcite .",
    "since then , only a few more interstellar ground - state oh maser sources have been observed at vlbi resolution @xcite . in order to understand the range of environments probed by oh masers in massive sfrs , we have undertaken a survey of the oh masers in 18 massive sfrs with the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "the data have already been published as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the results both in terms of relevance to individual sources and as a large collection of oh masers that can shed additional light on the physical processes of oh masers and the interpretation of their polarization .",
    "a brief overview of linear polarization theory is provided in  [ lintheory ] . in  [ results ]",
    ", we consider the set of oh masers as a whole to derive statistical properties . in  [ discussion ] , we present plausibility arguments to attempt to identify the physical processes responsible for the observed properties of oh masers .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in  [ conclusions ] . comments on individual sources are included in appendix [ sourcenotes ] .",
    "in the presence of a magnetic field , each of the main - line @xmath6 oh transitions split into three lines : two elliptically - polarized @xmath5-components shifted in frequency by the zeeman effect , and one linearly - polarized @xmath2-component at the natural frequency of oscillation for the velocity of the emitting material ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "due in part to unequal amplification , this clear pattern of three lines has only been seen once @xcite . to this point ,",
    "there have been few , if any , unambiguous detections of @xmath2-components .",
    "often , a single @xmath5-component is seen by itself , without an accompanying @xmath5-component polarized in the opposite circular handedness strong enough to be detected .",
    "significant linear polarizations , which could be produced by @xmath2-components , have been seen @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath5-components associated with magnetic fields with a nonzero perpendicular ( line - of - sight ) component are in general elliptically polarized , and elliptical polarization is the sum of circular and linear polarizations .",
    "thus , significant linear polarization fractions can be produced by both @xmath5- and @xmath2-components , the latter theoretically being 100% linearly polarized in all instances .",
    "the existence of maser spots with large ( but not unity ) fractional linear polarization suggests that @xmath2-components may in practice be partially circularly polarized as well .",
    "it is difficult to select an observational threshold of the linear polarization fraction that divides @xmath5-components from @xmath2-components .",
    "theoretical modelling by @xcite and @xcite suggests that amplification of @xmath2-components is stronger than that of @xmath5-components for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the angle of the magnetic field to the line of sight .",
    "this corresponds to a linear polarization fraction @xmath9 .",
    "but since linear and circular polarization fractions add in quadrature , a completely polarized spot is not more linear than circular until the linear polarization fraction exceeds 0.71 .",
    "even then it is unclear how @xmath2-components , which are theoretically totally linearly polarized , can acquire a circular component of polarization .",
    "this issue is discussed in further detail in  [ overlap ] .",
    "it is important to distinguish between @xmath5- and @xmath2-components , because the interpretation of the orientation of the magnetic field based on the linear polarization position angle is different for the two cases .",
    "the electric vector for a @xmath5-component is perpendicular to the two - dimensional magnetic field direction ( i.e. , on the plane of the sky ) , while the electric vector for a @xmath2-component is parallel to the two - dimensional magnetic field direction .",
    "thus , without information as to which maser spots are @xmath5-components and which are @xmath2-components , there is a @xmath10 ambiguity in the direction of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky .",

    "modelling of oh hyperfine populations for conditions typically found at maser sites shows that the amplification of @xmath2-components falls off rapidly for @xmath23 @xcite . for smaller @xmath8 , beaming and competitive gain favor @xmath5-components , suppressing amplification of @xmath2-components .",

    "these masers have a high linear polarization fraction .",
    "the second group , with position angles @xmath26 , are mostly circularly polarized .",
    "if we interpret these groups as @xmath2- and @xmath5-components respectively , the magnetic field implied from linear polarization lies at position angle @xmath27 in the region , with a scatter of @xmath28 .",

    "is marked along with the angle perpendicular to it .",
    "the ppas of highly linearly - polarized spots ( left of dotted line ) tend to be aligned parallel to the axis of the continuum source , while the ppas of highly circularly - polarized spots ( right of dotted line ) are roughly oriented perpendicular .",

    "they calculated a two - point spatial correlation function and found that the probability per unit solid angle of finding another maser spot within angular distance @xmath31 of a spot decreased sharply for @xmath32  cm .",
    "we performed a similar analysis on each of our sources , and the results for the ten having a large number of maser spots are shown in figure [ fig - all - seps ] .",
    "for all ten sources , the probability @xmath33 drops sharply between a separation of 0 and @xmath30  cm ( 67 au ) .",
    "the other sources in this study show similar behavior , although the plots are `` noisier '' owing to the smaller number of maser spots in the sources .",
    "this evidence argues in favor of a common clustering scale for oh masers in all massive sfrs .",
    "the maser spots within these clusters represent paths in the same condensation where the physical conditions are favorable to exponential amplification .",
    "if so , the overall extent of these condensations is perhaps a few times as large ( @xmath34  au ) , since paths through the periphery of the condensation are much less likely to produce comparable amplification lengths . in  [ shocks ] we suggest that instabilities in the shocked neutral gas may lead to the formation of such condensations .",
    "is the probability per unit solid angle that a maser spot can be found at angular distance @xmath31 from any given maser spot .",

    "these zeeman pairs are listed in table 21 of paper i. a histogram of the distribution of implied magnetic field strengths is given in figure [ zeeman - numbers ]",
    ". the distribution rises with increasing magnetic field strength to about 4  mg , then falls .",
    "few zeeman pairs are found that imply a splitting greater than about 8  mg , and the largest magnetic field strength found is 21  mg in e2 .",
    "there is theoretical support for the existence of an upper limit to the strength of the magnetic field in a zeeman pair for oh masers .",
    "the collapse of material increases both the density and the magnetic field ; @xcite suggests that the relation could be as steep as @xmath36 , and zeeman measurements of the magnetic field in molecular clouds are consistent with this relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at some density , the rate of collisional deexcitation will be higher than the pump rate ( presumably from radiative excitation ) , and the population inversion between the lower and upper states will be destroyed .",
    "the rate of collisions of h@xmath37 with oh is @xmath38 , where @xmath39  @xmath40s@xmath11 , and the pump rate likely is @xmath41  s@xmath11 , as would be expected for a far - infrared rotational transition @xcite .",
    "thus the population inversion will be destroyed by thermal collisions when the density is a few times @xmath42  @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the range of detected magnetic fields in our zeeman pairs is a factor of 35 ( 0.6 to 21 mg ) , or roughly @xmath44 .",
    "if the @xmath45 scaling law applies throughout this entire range , this implies that the range of densities sampled by those masers in zeeman pairs is a factor of @xmath46 , or about @xmath47 , assuming that the 21  mg magnetic field in w51 e2 is near the upper end of magnetic field strengths allowable before collisional depopulation of the upper state is significant .",
    "the lack of zeeman pairs below 0.5  mg may be an observational effect .",
    "for such small magnetic fields , the splitting is less than a typical line - width , and we make no attempt to identify zeeman pairs less than 0.5  mg due to the difficulty of distinguishing small zeeman shifts from other effects . for example , consider a right - elliptically polarized @xmath5-component in a region where the magnetic field orientation varies along the amplification path , as in figure [ freq - dep ] .",
    "the linear component of the polarization will be seen as weak emission in lcp .",
    "if there is also a velocity gradient along the amplification path , the linear polarization component may be shifted in velocity with respect to the circular polarization component .",
    "this would manifest itself in our observations as a velocity difference between the lines seen in the two circularly - polarized feeds : the rcp feed would detect nearly all the emission , while the lcp feed would detect only the weaker , velocity - shifted linear component . for the parameters shown in figure [ freq - dep ] , the shift between lcp and rcp velocity corresponds to an apparent magnetic field strength of 0.1  mg at 1667 mhz in the zeeman interpretation , although broader lines and more extreme variations of the linear polarization fraction across a linewidth can produce larger apparent shift between the components .",
    "@xmath43 at 4  mg as suggested for w3(oh ) @xcite and an @xmath36 scaling law .",
    "the 19.8 and 21.0  mg fields in w51 , not included in this plot , would correspond to a density of @xmath48  @xmath43 under these assumptions.[zeeman - numbers],width=480 ]    whose linear polarization fraction varies across the linewidth as shown in the top panel .",
    "the linear fraction could vary in this manner ( for instance ) due to a bend in the magnetic field along the amplification path .",
    "the bottom panel shows the line as would be detected by rcp and lcp feeds .",

    "zeeman pairs with larger separations are identified when unambiguous , but they have been excluded from the present consideration in order not to introduce bias .",
    "the rapid falloff of the number of pairs identified with increasing component separation suggests that the dearth of identifiable zeeman pairs at larger separations is real .",
    "note that figure [ zeemanseps ] has not been normalized by area ; were it to be so normalized , it would fall even faster .",
    "if the distribution of zeeman component separations were uniformly random , a plot of the unnormalized number of identifiable zeeman components versus component separation would be an _ increasing _ function of separation ( at least up to a distance beyond which pairing is no longer unambiguous ) .",
    "this is certainly not observed , providing further evidence that the @xmath30  cm clustering scale is a physically significant scale over which physical parameters are sufficiently coherent to provide an environment conducive to maser activity .",
    "thus it appears that the spatial separation of the @xmath5-components in a zeeman pair is generally a factor of several smaller than the size of the cluster containing the pair . nevertheless , there are some pairs of maser spots polarized predominantly in opposite circular senses whose separation is comparable to or exceeds @xmath30  cm .",
    "it is possible that these are not true zeeman pairs of @xmath5-components from the same masing subregion but rather two oppositely - polarized @xmath5-components from different zeeman pairs , of which only one component is seen in each .",
    "such a situation could arise if amplification at each maser site favors only one sense of circular polarization , as described below .",
    "the magnetic fields implied by these zeeman `` cousins '' would be less accurate due to two effects .",
    "first , the systemic velocity at each maser site may be different due to turbulence .",
    "@xcite calculate that a typical intracluster turbulent velocity is 0.6  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to an effective zeeman splitting of 1.0 mg in the 1665 mhz transition and 1.7 mg in the 1667 mhz transition .",
    "second , the magnetic field strength may be different at the maser sites .",
    "this difference is generally less than 1 mg ( see  [ magstruc ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field strengths implied by zeeman cousins should therefore be accurate to better than 2 mg .",
    "-component separations in a zeeman pair .",

    "the larger number of high flux ratios ( @xmath59 ) for the 1665  mhz transition appears real , although it may partially be due to a selection effect .",

    "the detection limit in our survey varies somewhat by source but is approximately 0.1  jy .",
    "thus , the identification of a zeeman pair with flux ratio @xmath60 requires that the stronger component have a flux density higher than @xmath61  jy . the relative scarcity of 1667  mhz zeeman pairs with a flux ratio greater than 10 can be explaned by the paucity of zeeman components with a flux density greater than 1  jy . only in one - third of cases",

    "the difference becomes more extreme .",
    "the relative absence of 1667  mhz zeeman pairs with large flux ratios , noted previously in w3(oh ) @xcite , is consistent with the picture that maser transitions with smaller zeeman splitting coefficients tend to have zeeman pairs in which the @xmath5-components are more equal in intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "as expected , there does not appear to be a preference for masers to appear preferentially in one circular polarization than the other , though occasionally an individual source may have a preponderance of maser spots in one polarization , as is the case in w75 s , in which we find 35 rcp and 19 lcp spots in the 1665  mhz transition . for a source with 54 spots , we would expect @xmath62 spots in each polarization , so the deviation seen in w75 s is not significant .",

    "if the faraday rotation is a factor of @xmath4 larger , the faraday rotation over a gain length can be large , and linear polarization fractions will approach zero @xcite . in cases where the faraday rotation per gain length is significant , interpretation of the ppa will be difficult because maser amplification will stimulate emission in the orthogonal linear mode as well @xcite .",
    "significant generalized faraday rotation may also circularize @xmath2-components .",

    "such faraday depolarization may also explain certain maser features that are seen with similar flux densities in rcp and lcp but without any detected linear polarization , such as spots 18 , 24 , and 36 in table 9 of paper i. it is highly unlikely that the lack of linear polarization in w51 can be due to chance alignments of the magnetic field in an extremely narrow cone oriented toward or away from us at each maser site , producing @xmath5-components that are purely circularly polarized , because the magnetic field is seen to reverse line - of - sight direction across the source .",
    "thus , the inclination of the magnetic field to the line of sight must take on values intermediate to the @xmath169 and @xmath147 required for pure - circular masers in the absence of faraday rotation",
    ".    a medium range of faraday rotation would be enough to partially ( but not totally ) circularize @xmath5-components .",
    "the observed circular polarization fraction will in general be a complicated function of the electron density , maser gain length , and angle of propagation with respect to the magnetic field direction , but the presence of faraday rotation will strictly increase the circular polarization fraction compared to the case in which no faraday rotation is present @xcite .",
    "straightforward application of equation ( 50 ) of @xcite without accounting for faraday rotation will cause the inclination of the magnetic field to the line of sight to be underestimated .",
    "faraday rotation may also explain why linear polarization vectors appear to be disorganized in some sources . if a large electron density is required for faraday rotation along the amplification path in the interior of a masing cloud , it is likely that the electron density is high exterior to the masing cloud as well .",
    "this would rotate the apparent ppa of the maser emission .",
    "fluctuations in the electron density , possibly caused by density inhomogeneities or anisotropy of the ionizing radiation field , could cause emission from adjacent maser spots to be faraday rotated by different amounts .",
    "if this is indeed the case , reconstructing the magnetic field orientation in the plane of the sky is a difficult task , and reconstructing the full three - dimensional orientation of the magnetic field may be nearly impossible .",
    "scatter broadening of some sources implies strong density fluctuations and a high column density of electrons along the radiation propagation path .",
    "since the scatter broadening is proportional to the distance between the source and the scattering screen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a screen of electrons near the source is unlikely to increase the angular size as much as a cloud of electrons several kiloparsecs away in the galactic plane .",

    "for example , there are a number of maser spots where the lcp and rcp flux densities are nearly equal and centered at roughly the same position and velocity . since there is nearly no detected linear polarization in the oh masers in this source , it is possible that these maser spots are only partially polarized .",
    "these maser spots could also be produced by masing in sites where the magnetic field splitting is small compared to the line width @xcite .",
    "our data do not provide sufficient resolution to tell whether the spots with roughly equal rcp and lcp fluxes are due to two 100% polarized spots that are at slightly different positions and velocities or whether they are due to a single spot that is not 100% polarized .",

    "two - thirds of maser spots have no detectable linear polarization at all . as discussed in  [ faraday ] , amplification of @xmath2-components may be reduced by faraday rotation along the amplification path .",
    "two additional effects pointed out by @xcite may explain the larger fraction of @xmath5-components we detect .",
    "first , although an inclination of @xmath25 divides angular phase space into two distinct regions in which @xmath5- and @xmath2-components dominate , the relative amplification of @xmath5- and @xmath2-components is larger for @xmath23 , where @xmath5-components dominate , than for @xmath181 , where @xmath2-components dominate . in the unsaturated regime , the ratio of the absorption coefficients for @xmath5- and @xmath2-components , @xmath182 , reaches a minimum of 0.5 at @xmath183 . for comparison , @xmath182 reaches a value of 2 at @xmath184 and grows in an unbounded manner as @xmath185 ( see  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "unsaturated @xmath2-components should on average be weaker than unsaturated @xmath5-components , so the percentage of @xmath5-components above a reasonable detection threshold would be higher than the 60% expected based on an analysis of the sizes of angular phase space alone .",
    "second , as masers saturate , competitive gain will favor the stronger component .",
    "saturated @xmath5-components will reduce the absorption coefficient @xmath186 by a factor of 3 , but saturated @xmath2-components only reduce @xmath187 by a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath5-components should be even more numerous than @xmath2-components even if the masers are saturated .",
    "however , it is clear that some @xmath2-components are seen in the @xmath6 maser transitions .",
    "some maser spots exhibit a high degree of linear polarization as would be expected for @xmath2-components , and the distribution of ppa in some sources strongly suggests that @xmath2-components are seen ( see  [ notes - w75n ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , maser spots that we believe are @xmath2-components are not 100% linearly polarized .",
    "since @xmath188 radiation is inherently linearly polarized , circular polarization must be generated externally .",
    "we speculate that these @xmath2-components with nonzero circular polarization arise from the superposition of two masing clumps along the line of sight .",
    "if the emission from a @xmath2-component spot intersects a region of oh appropriately shifted in velocity , it may stimulate emission in a @xmath5 mode . since the incident radiation from the first cloud ( i.e. , the @xmath2-component ) is highly amplified and therefore bright , it can strongly stimulate the second cloud , since the incident linear polarization will be seen by the second cloud as a superposition of the two opposite - handed circular modes .",
    "even if the amplification in the second cloud is very weak , a significant amount of circular polarization can be added , and the radiation will no longer be completely linearly polarized , as shown in appendix [ stokesappendix ] .",
    "the distinction between a @xmath2- and a @xmath5-component may be blurred if there is @xmath189 gain length of material in the second cloud .",
    "this circularization of a bright @xmath2-component due to an extremely weak @xmath5-component requires that the weak cloudlet be in front of the bright maser from the observer s perspective .",
    "if the @xmath5-component is behind the @xmath2-component , the propagation path of radiation passes first through the weak ( @xmath5 ) cloudlet and then through the strong @xmath2-component . the radiation field that the cloudlet amplifies",
    ", whether background continuum or its own spontaneous emission , is much weaker than in the case where the radiation from the @xmath2-component stimulates emission from the @xmath5-component , so the superposition of spots would be indistinguishable from an isolated @xmath2-component with no surrounding material .    in principle the reverse scenario could occur as well : a @xmath5-component stimulates emission in the @xmath2-mode from a smaller cloud of oh gas at the appropriate velocity for amplification .",
    "this would have the effect of adding extra linear polarization to a @xmath5-component .",
    "since @xmath5-components are in general elliptically polarized ( i.e. , have a nonzero linear polarization fraction ) , it may not be possible to distinguish observationally between a @xmath5-component that has stimulated weak emission in the @xmath2-mode from a second maser clump and one that has not .",
    "the linear polarization fraction of a @xmath5-component is a function of the inclination of the magnetic field to the line of sight @xcite , so this effect could lead to overestimation of the magnetic field inclination at oh maser sites .",
    "it is probable that the overlap of maser components along the line of sight would add circular polarization to @xmath2-components more systemically than it would add linear polarization to @xmath5-components . for most common bulk material motions ( e.g. , infall , outflow , rotation ) ,",
    "the radial component of the velocity field will change monotonically along a ray from a maser spot to the observer .",
    "if the change in radial velocity along the line of sight exceeds the zeeman splitting between a @xmath5- and @xmath2-component ( 1.2  km  s@xmath11  at 1665 mhz and 0.7  km  s@xmath11  at 1667 mhz for a 4  mg magnetic field ) , the radiation from the @xmath2-component may stimulate weak amplification from oh in a @xmath5 mode .",
    "but a @xmath5-component could only stimulate emission from the @xmath2 mode of a cloud of oh along the line of sight if the change in radial velocity were in the same sense as the zeeman splitting of the @xmath5-component .",
    "given that only a small column density of oh along the line of sight between a maser and the observer is required to add significant circular polarization to the observed maser , it is likely that a large fraction of @xmath2-components will be misidentified as @xmath5-components .",
    "unless there is an abrupt outer edge to the radial distribution of oh in a massive star - forming region , the radiation from many @xmath2-components will stimulate weak emission in a @xmath5-mode of the surrounding oh .      in several sources , oh masers are found in elongated filamentary arrangements .",
    "for instance , there is a line of maser spots near the origin in the w75 s map shown in figure 25 of paper i , and the masers in w75 n ( figure 27 of paper i ) appear to be oriented primarily along two perpendicular axes . in the filamentary arrangement of maser spots seen in the northern grouping of w75 n",
    ", the sky projection of the magnetic field as deduced from the ppa of the linear portion of the polarization implies that the magnetic field may be aligned predominantly along the line of elongation .",
    "often there is a velocity gradient along the elongation , such as in w75 s or the masers in a ne / sw line in on  2  n. these lines of masers with velocity gradients are common in ch@xmath100oh .",
    "@xcite observed 10 sources for which the maser spots were distributed mostly in a line with the major axis of the distribution several times greater than the minor axis .",
    "plots of the velocity of the maser spots versus the major axis offset are generally distributed into two quadrants rather than tightly along a straight line @xcite .",
    "the authors speculated that the masers are tracing circumstellar disks and that the deviation from a straight line in the velocity - major axis plots is due to maser amplification at different radii in the same circumstellar disk .",
    "more recent observations do not seem to favor the interpretation of these maser arrangements as circumstellar disks , however .",
    "first , @xcite looked for h@xmath37 @xmath190 s(1 ) emission in massive sfrs for which circumstellar disks were suspected on the basis of collinear distributions of methanol masers .",
    "since molecular hydrogen is a diagnostic of shocked outflows , it was expected that the h@xmath37 emission would be oriented primarily perpendicular to the putative disks . instead ,",
    "the h@xmath37 emission in almost all of the sources for which it was detected was preferentially oriented parallel to the line of methanol masers .",
    "de buizer suggested that the masers were instead tracing an outflow .",
    "second , the proper motions of maser spots in the two linear structures in g9.62@xmath810.20 are directed primarily perpendicular to the structures @xcite .",
    "this suggests that in at least some cases methanol masers may trace shocks rather than circumstellar disks .",
    "whether this applies to similar arrangements of oh masers is not yet well established .",
    "it is believed that the lifetimes of methanol and hydroxyl masers overlap but are not identical @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that structures delineated by oh masers trace a different evolutionary phase of forming high - mass stars than do ch@xmath100oh masers .",
    "an alternate possibility to the disk hypothesis is that these elongated arrangements of maser spots may simply be a result of the motion of material threaded by magnetic fields .",
    "this could be a result of 1 ) collapse in the early stages of star formation or 2 ) shock - driven outflows in later stages . in case 1 ) , as clouds of oh and other material fall inward , they will draw the magnetic field inward with them .",
    "this will tend to align field lines with the material elongations , provided there is enough angular momentum to avoid spherical collapse . in case 2 ) , a shock propagating outward from the boundary of the uc  region compresses material ahead of it , leading to elongations along the shock front .",
    "the drift speed for ambipolar diffusion of a magnetic field out of a maser cloud is @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the radius of a maser spot , @xmath193 is the ion - neutral collision rate coefficient , and @xmath194 is the ionization fraction @xcite . the drift speed is less than a typical shock speed ( @xmath195  km  s@xmath11 ) , especially if carbon is ionized in any substantial fraction .",
    "thus , the magnetic field will be dragged along and compressed by the shock , resulting in a field oriented parallel to the shock front and therefore along the material elongation .",
    "unless the shock is totally planar , there may be velocity gradients along the elongations .",
    "the slight curvature to some of these elongations may also be explained by the expansion of a spherical shock front or a planar shock into an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "this is in contrast to models explaining elongated arrangements of maser spots as disks , where little curvature would be expected if preferentially seen edge - on .",
    "nevertheless , some curvature along the elongations may be produced if a disk is inclined .      as mentioned in  [ clusterscale ] , there is a characteristic maser clumping scale of @xmath0  cm .",
    "additionally , maser clusters tend to be concentrated on or near the periphery of  regions .",
    "this is not always the case in complicated sources such as w75 n , but more often than not these maser clusters appear near the boundary of an  region , especially given that we observe three - dimensional distributions of masers in projection .",
    "occasionally even individual clusters are elongated in a filamentary manner , as in w3(oh ) @xcite .",
    "it is possible that these clusters of oh masers form in shocked neutral gas outside the ionization boundary .",
    "the initial growth phase of a uc  region involves an @xmath107-type ionization front ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when the speed of the ionization front slows to twice the sound speed of the ionized material , a transition occurs and the ionization front changes to a weak @xmath196-type @xcite .",
    "this is characterized by the existence of two separate fronts : an ionization ( i ) front and a shock ( s ) front that precedes it .",
    "@xcite directly measured the expansion speed of the uc  region , i.e. , the i front , in w3(oh ) to be @xmath197  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "since the speed of the i front is less than the sound speed in the ionized material ( @xmath198  km  s@xmath11 ) , the ionization front must be of @xmath196-type in w3(oh ) .",

    "less clear is the exact mechanism of instability growth , although there is no shortage of candidates @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the slab of material between the i and s fronts was unstable to oscillatory transverse perturbations .",
    "the wavelength of fastest perturbation growth was found to increase with time .",
    "@xcite obtained similar results and additionally suggested that unstable small - scale fragmentation would eventually allow neutral gas to be swept up behind the fragments and lead to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , although it is unclear whether this would occur at the time and size scales of _ ultracompact _ regions .",
    "@xcite argued based on the evolutionary sequence of perturbation shapes of the bright rims in diffuse nebulae that the rayleigh - taylor instability alone can not be the cause of fingering , although his analysis was based on older , lower - density  regions .",

    "two - dimensional simulations by @xcite demonstrate the appearance of this hydrodynamical instability regardless of the density structure of the neutral gas and details of the radiative cooling law included .",
    "the wavelength of the fastest - growing perturbations increases with time , with interfragment spacings on the order of several times 100 au near the base of the fingers and approximately 100 au near the tips for uc  ages near @xmath199 years , as shown graphically in their figure 6 .",
    "note that this is consistent with both the clustering scale and the dynamical age of oh masers , as discussed in   [ clusterscale ] and [ relation - hii ] .",
    "assuming that some clusters near uc  regions form in the shocked neutral medium between the i and s fronts , two projection - related factors would imply that clusters should be more frequently found at the periphery of  regions rather than atop them , an effect not seen ( see  [ relation - hii ] ) .",
    "first , velocity gradients are likely to be higher along the fingers of shocked neutral material than across them .",
    "amplification lengths should therefore be longer on average for fingers pointing in the plane of the sky , where the velocity gradient is tangential in projection , than for fingers pointing toward us ( i.e. , projected near the center of the  region ) . still , potential path lengths are longer along fingers rather than across them , and it is unclear whether velocity gradients are large enough to favor amplification across rather than along the fingers .",
    "second , the magnetic field threading the neutral material will be dragged along with it .",
    "field lines will be folded such that a field line entering the finger from the neutral material will exit the finger back into the neutral material after bending through @xmath200 .",
    "this would imply an effective reversal of the line - of - sight direction for lines of sight along fingers .",
    "however , _",
    "intra_-cluster magnetic field line reversals are never seen . indeed , the magnetic fields deduced from oh maser in clusters superposed atop  regions in on  1 and w3(oh ) suggest that there is a consistent line - of - sight field direction in those sources even atop the  region .",
    "it is possible that oh masing clumps occur near the `` palms '' of the fingers or that the fingers of neutral material containing the oh masers are not very long . in either case",
    ", the bend in the magnetic field lines could be much less than @xmath147 , consistent with our lack of detection of line - of - sight field reversals in these clusters .",
    "large - scale ( @xmath201  au ) collinear maser structures , such as the ne / sw line in on  2  n , probably can not be explained by shock instabilities around the uc  region because they are larger in scale than the  region itself .",
    "it is still possible that these structures occur in neutral gas that has been shocked by another source in the star - forming complex .",
    "there is often a velocity gradient along these structures , which could be explained by a curved or decelerating shock .      noting that line - of - sight directions obtained from zeeman splitting in eight galactic oh maser sources were consistent with a clockwise galactic field , @xcite postulated that oh masers in massive star - forming regions traced the galactic magnetic field .",
    "follow - up studies by @xcite and @xcite supported this claim but were suggestive of a more complicated galactic field structure .",
    "subsequent analyses employing this technique on ever - larger sample sizes have indicated that correlations with the galactic magnetic field may exist @xcite , but detailed probing of the galactic field with this method remains elusive .",
    "observational limitations of this method consist of unknown distances to many of the sources as well as possibly incorrect magnetic field data resulting from inadequate spatial resolution to unambiguously identify zeeman pairs of maser features , since few sources have been observed at vlbi resolution . additionally , magnetic field information has thus far been limited to the sign of the line - of - sight field orientation ( i.e , whether the magnetic field points in the hemisphere toward or away from the sun )",

    "if the magnetic field orientation in massive star - forming regions is correlated with the galactic field , the processes of high - mass star formation must not tightly wrap the magnetic field configuration despite the rotation and collapse necessary to produce the central condensation , a proposition for which there is theoretical support ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as discussed in",
    " [ magstruc ] , an ordered magnetic field can be inferred from the regularity of the line - of - sight direction of the magnetic field over large portions of the source and the field strengths inferred from zeeman pairs within the same clusters of @xmath30  cm . furthermore , the magnetic fields deduced from oh zeeman splitting in massive sfrs separated by distances on the order of a kiloparsec show a preference to be co - aligned @xcite .",
    "a numerical investigation of the collapse of rotating , magnetized , isothermal cloud cores suggests that collapse can occur without introducing a significant twist to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these authors find that the maximum pitch angle of the magnetic field is approximately @xmath202 along a ridge of accreting material ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "inward from this ridge the magnetic field resists wrapping , while outward from the ridge the wrap from differential rotation is small .",
    "simulations by @xcite confirm that the magnetic field of a collapsing core maintains alignment with the magnetic field of the parent cloud .",

    "if these models are correct , the magnetic field orientation before collapse might be partially preserved in the material surrounding the core . since the fields around newly - formed massive stars are ordered ( see  [ magstruc ] )",

    "* the wide range of polarization properties observed in oh masers may be explained by a combination of faraday rotation and overlap of maser components .",
    "if oh masers are indeed near or embedded in regions , the electron density may be high enough that the masers are near a critical point of faraday rotation .",
    "a typical maser spot likely has large ( @xmath167  rad ) faraday rotation over the entire amplification length , but not over a single gain length of the maser .",

    "it is unclear whether this 10  km  s@xmath11  difference reflects a large velocity gradient in the northern part of the source or whether the 6031 and 6035 mhz emission comes from a different area , reflecting registration uncertainties between the various sets of observations .",
    "two 13441 mhz zeeman pairs at 14.1 and 0.3  km  s@xmath11  indicate magnetic fields of @xmath251 and @xmath252  mg , respectively @xcite .",
    "since registration uncertainties of a few tenths of an arcsecond may exist between the continuum image and our maser spot maps , one possible interpretation is that the northern and southern maser groups are located on the limb of the uc  region , while the center group is projected onto the  region .",

    "they concluded that the motions in on  1 were consistent with infall and rotation .",
    "the velocities of the three groups of maser spots we observe may be consistent with infall and rotation on a smaller angular scale as well .",
    "if the north and south maser groups are at limbs of the rotation , the implied rotation speed would be 5  km  s@xmath11  centered at 9  km  s@xmath11  and roughly aligned with the direction of rotation noted by zheng et al .",

    ", 5  km  s@xmath11  corresponds to the freefall velocity for a @xmath257 star , so if net rotation is also sustained , rapidly spiralling infall must be occurring .",
    "nevertheless , this could explain why the rcp maser emission in the northern group is seen farther from the center of the  region than the lcp emission . because the magnetic field splits the rcp emission to a lower lsr velocity than the lcp emission , the coherent path length is larger farther away from the center of the  region .",

    "the closest feature we find to matching this is a 1665 mhz maser of 0.11 jy lcp flux at 17.8 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "we detect this feature in the 17.76 and 17.93 km  s@xmath11  velocity channels , but the lack of detection in a third channel prevents us from being able to accurately determine the velocity and linewidth of this feature .",
    "are due to the elliptical polarization of the lcp features .",
    "bottom : the same spectra when corrected for a @xmath288 mg magnetic field .",
    "note that the velocity range is more than halved compared to the observed spectra.[s269-spec],width=576 ]      the mon r2 molecular cloud is one of the nearest high - mass star - forming regions , but it contains almost no stars of spectral type earlier than b1 @xcite .",
    "an unusual property of mon r2 is that maser emission from the 4765 mhz ( @xmath291 ) transition of oh is stronger than from the ground - state ( @xmath6 ) set of transitions , suggesting that the physical conditions are denser and hotter than normally seen for ground - state oh masers , as noted by @xcite .",
    "they detect two masers at 10.65  km  s@xmath11  with linear polarization position angles of 13 and 14 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the brightest maser feature we detect , coincident with the brightest 4765 mhz maser to within registration uncertainties , which has linear polarization with a position angle of 13 .",
    "the velocity of this 1665 mhz maser feature is 10.29  km  s@xmath11  when corrected for the zeeman splitting of the @xmath292  mg magnetic field at the site .",
    "the 4765 mhz masers in mon r2 are highly variable , doubling in strength in less than 19 days and reaching a peak of nearly 80 jy before `` disappearing '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds that 1665 and 1667 mhz emission is much less variable , varying relatively smoothly with changes in flux density not exceeding a factor of two over a timescale of more than four years .",
    "g351.775@xmath820.538 contains what was the strongest known interstellar oh maser spot ( 400 jy in lcp ) until the recent flare in w75 n @xcite . @xcite",
    "first noted that the brightness of this maser spot is highly variable , and it has been monitored frequently since then ( see * ? ? ?",
    "ground - state masers have previously been seen at velocities as low as @xmath293  km  s@xmath11@xcite and as high as @xmath294  km  s@xmath11  @xcite .",
    "our vlba observations covered only the top half of this range .",
    "there is a reversal of the line - of - sight magnetic field direction across the source , as has been previously noted at 1665 and 1667 mhz by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this reversal is seen at 1720 mhz as well , where @xcite finds magnetic fields of @xmath295 and @xmath216  mg .",
    "@xcite find a @xmath296  mg field at 6035 mhz .    because g351.775@xmath820.538 is a low declination source , @xmath297-coverage is poor , especially along north - south baselines . the synthesized beam and spot sizes as listed in table 20 of paper",
    "i are thus very large .",
    "this may explain the separations of zeeman components for g351.775@xmath820.538 ( see table 21 of paper i ) , which are larger than for other sources .",
    "in this appendix we consider the polarization properties expected of a @xmath2-component that stimulates weak amplification from a @xmath5-mode of a clump of oh between the first maser and the observer , as described in ",
    "[ overlap ] .",
    "it is helpful to analyze the radiation in terms of the stokes parameters , which are defined in terms of the electric fields in the radiation as follows : @xmath298 they can also be written in terms of the electric fields in the two senses of circular polarization : @xmath299 where @xmath300 , etc .",
    "consider a simple case of weak maser amplification in the absence of faraday rotation .",
    "we will start with radiation that is 100% linearly polarized in the @xmath60-direction , as could be produced by a @xmath2-component .",
    "the stokes parameters of the radiation are @xmath301 so the polarization fractions ( @xmath302 linear , @xmath303 circular , and @xmath304 total ) are @xmath305 now suppose that this radiation is fed into a second , weak maser spot shifted in velocity such that emission is stimulated in the rcp @xmath5-mode .",
    "the amplification factor is such that the flux density in the rcp mode is multiplied by a factor of 2 .",
    "then @xmath306 where the factors of @xmath307 are due to the fact that if the flux density increases by a factor of 2 , the electric field amplitude increases by a factor of @xmath307 . substituting these values into equation ( [ stokesdef2 ] ) results in the following : @xmath308 converting equation ( [ stokesresults ] ) to polarization fractions",
    ", we obtain @xmath309 the net effect is that the maser is still 100% polarized , but the linear polarization fraction has dropped to less than unity and the circular polarization fraction is reasonably large . for amplification of a single circular mode by a factor of @xmath310 , the linear polarization fraction is @xmath311 the circular and linear polarization fractions become equal at @xmath312 , or approximately 1.8 @xmath3-fold amplification lengths for an unsaturated maser .",
