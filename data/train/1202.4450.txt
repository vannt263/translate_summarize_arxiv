    "hierarchical models of structure formation predict that galaxy groups and clusters ( hereafter referred to collectively as galaxy systems ) form via the gravitational infall of field galaxies and smaller systems @xcite .",
    "the effects of dark energy will eventually halt the infall @xcite , at which time the system can be considered fully assembled .",
    "dynamical friction will cause some of these galaxies to merge , resulting in the formation of a massive galaxy near the base of the gravitational potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a magnitude gap can then develop as the timescale for orbital decay by dynamical friction is inversely proportional to galaxy mass and so the more massive galaxies will tend to merge first @xcite .",
    "the cooling timescale of the intergalactic medium is longer , so the system will be surrounded by a halo of x - ray - emitting gas .",
    "such systems have come to be referred to as `` fossil groups '' .",
    "the most commonly accepted definition of a fossil group @xcite requires ( 1 ) an @xmath3-band magnitude gap of 2 or greater between the two brightest galaxies located within half the virial radius of the system and ( 2 ) extended x - ray emission with a bolometric x - ray luminosity @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the x - ray criterion guarantees the existence of at least a group - size halo while the optical criterion ensures ( approximately ) that there are no @xmath6 galaxies inside the radius for orbital decay by dynamical friction .",
    "originally , the term `` fossil group '' ( or `` fossil galaxy group '' ) referred to an apparently isolated galaxy , which due to a surrounding halo of x - ray - emitting gas , was assumed to have previously resided in a group @xcite .",
    "the word `` fossil '' was used because the merger history of the group was thought to be contained within this single galaxy . since then",
    ", fossil groups ( i.e. , galaxies ) have been found within actual galaxy groups and this has lead to a degree of confusion and a gradual shift from `` fossil group '' referring to the individual galaxy to the group as a whole .",
    "additionally , since the definition of a fossil group that has developed only sets lower limits on both the size of the magnitude gap and the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , it is possible to find fossil groups with properties that are more consistent with those of galaxy clusters , as we do in this work ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we replace the word `` group '' with the word `` system '' , so that `` fossil system '' ( fs ) refers to a galaxy group or cluster that satisfies the above two criteria and `` fossil galaxy '' ( fg ) refers to the most - luminous galaxy in an fs .",
    "this is the nomenclature that we shall use throughout the remainder of this paper .",
    "the initial interpretation of fgs was that they represent the end product of galaxy merging in groups or clusters .",
    "the magnitude gap in an fs was accounted for by an early formation epoch that allowed time for sufficient mergers .",
    "the observed regular , symmetric x - ray emission @xcite and highly concentrated mass profiles @xcite of fss support this idea .",
    "likewise , simulations have shown that fss form a large fraction of their mass at high redshift , and that they form earlier than non - fss @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite found a correlation between the magnitude gap at @xmath8 and the formation time of the fs in the sense that early - forming systems have larger gaps ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "note , however , that infall can result in a smaller magnitude gap without the system necessarily being late - forming .",
    "simulations by @xcite suggest that the formation of fss is primarily driven by the relatively early in - fall of massive satellites with the magnitude gap arising after the system has built up half of its final mass .",
    "the formation appears particularly efficient if the in - fall occurs along filaments with small impact parameters @xcite .",
    "studies of the fs luminosity function @xcite have found parameters that are consistent with the universal luminosity function of clusters derived by @xcite , although they are deficient in @xmath9 galaxies .",
    "it is possible that fss formed with a deficit of @xmath9 galaxies @xcite .",
    "this alternate formation scenario interprets fss as ` failed groups ' in which the majority of the available gas was initially used up in a single luminous galaxy rather than in several .",
    "similarly , @xcite found that fss have low richnesses but masses comparable to those of clusters resulting in high dynamical mass - to - light ratios .",
    "as with their masses , fs x - ray scaling relations are more consistent with clusters than groups @xcite , leading to the suggestion that fss are merely representative of an evolutionary phase @xcite  after 4 gyr @xmath10 of fss in simulations are found to have become non - fossil @xcite .    in one of the only studies of its kind , @xcite looked at the merger history of fgs in simulated fss within the millennium simulation galaxy catalogue .",
    "they find that , like brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , fgs are mainly formed by gas - poor mergers but that fgs are formed later than bcgs , i.e. , they undergo mergers at lower redshifts , despite the fact that fss assembled most of their virial mass at higher redshifts in comparison with non - fss .",
    "no age differences were found between the stellar populations in fss and bright field ellipticals @xcite , which is consistent with a later formation if the mergers were gas - poor .",
    "numerous studies have been made of the growth of bcgs and the results are conflicting .",
    "simulations performed in a hierarchical context predict that bcgs are the result of multiple mergers and therefore should continue to grow until @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , however , bcgs are found to evolve passively since @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "defining fs samples is difficult due to the need for both good quality x - ray and optical data , and so most of our understanding has come from simulations .",
    "the initial observational studies focused on small samples or single objects and so the number of known fss remains small ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a good summary ) .",
    "enabled by the large quantity of data produced by surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more recent studies have focused on defining and analyzing larger samples of fss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but in most cases these samples lack the high - quality x - ray data necessary to ensure that the definition of an fs is met and often the criteria have been relaxed to such an extent that the possibility of substantial contamination is high .",
    "the purpose of this study is two - fold .",
    "first , we want to take the high quality x - ray data from the _ xmm _ cluster survey ( xcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and combine it with the optical data from the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) to produce a secure sample of fss ; we choose purity over quantity .",
    "second , we want to compare the stellar mass assembly and the stellar populations of fgs to various other samples , and to examine the x - ray scaling relations of fss .    the xcs is a serendipitous search for galaxy clusters using all publicly available data in the _ xmm _ science archive .",
    "its main aims are to measure cosmological parameters and trace the evolution of x - ray scaling relations .",
    "the first data release from xcs ( xcs - dr1 * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m11 ) contains 503 clusters of which 402 have measured x - ray temperatures ( @xmath13 ) and luminosities . the serendipitous nature of xcs is a big advantage because it allows the detection of smaller systems , which have a higher probability of satisfying the optical criterion in the fs definition @xcite .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "we outline the samples used in section [ samples ] , including a review of the definition of an fs and our methodology for searching for them . in section [ data ] , we describe the various data sets utilized in this study .",
    "the results of our study into the stellar masses and the stellar populations of fossil galaxies are presented in section [ stellar populations ] , while section [ assem ] presents the results of our study of the x - ray scaling relations and stellar mass assembly of fgs and bcgs .",
    "a discussion of all these results can be found in section [ discussion ] and our conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we assume a @xmath14cdm cosmology with hubble parameter @xmath15 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , dark matter density parameter @xmath16 , and matter density parameter @xmath17 .",
    "in this section , we outline our methodology for searching for fss within the xcs and the sdss and present our final sample of 17 . we also discuss two samples of bcgs , one optically selected and one x - ray selected , which we use as comparison samples .",
    "we begin by making a few comments on how fss are defined .",
    "the most commonly used definition of an fs is that found in @xcite , which is reproduced in the introduction .",
    "this definition is motivated by physical arguments but is not beyond modification .",
    "the x - ray criterion was set to only select galaxies that reside in at least a group - sized halo and so does not have much scope for modification , the adopted magnitude gap , on the other hand , does .",
    "this is because studies of the magnitude gap in both clusters @xcite and groups @xcite have shown a wide range of gaps .",
    "the average magnitude gap between a @xmath18 bcg and the second brightest cluster member is found to be 0.5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also loh & strauss 2006 ) , with poor systems exhibiting a larger average gap .",
    "statistically , it is easier to get large magnitude gaps when the number of galaxies in the system is low @xcite . in simulations",
    ", @xcite found that the strongest x - ray fs candidates are those with the highest x - ray luminosity as these systems are not expected to have a large luminosity gap entirely by chance .",
    "@xcite have suggested , based on numerical simulations , that a magnitude gap of 2.5 between the brightest and fourth - brightest galaxies is a better indicator of an fs .",
    "they find that the 2 mag gap is better at finding high - mass systems but the 2.5 mag gap finds 50% more early - forming systems and those that are in the fossil phase longer .",
    "the definition of an fs that we adopt here is a combination of the x - ray criterion of @xcite and the optical criterion of @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a system to be classified as a fossil by us it needs to have @xmath19 erg s@xmath5 and a magnitude gap of 2.5 in the @xmath20 band between the brightest and the fourth brightest galaxies located within half the virial radius , which we denote as @xmath21 . the virial radius is approximated with @xmath22 , the radius at which the average density is equal to 200 times the critical density of the universe , and @xmath7 is the bolometric x - ray luminosity inside this radius . in appendix",
    "[ robust ] we investigate how our results change if the standard definition of an fs is adopted , i.e. , replacing the @xcite magnitude gap with that of @xcite .",
    "previous searches for fss began by looking for galaxies that satisfied the magnitude gap criterion and then tried to match them to an x - ray detection . here , we take the opposite approach and examine the galaxies associated with an extended x - ray source to determine the magnitude gap .",
    "we begin with the @xmath23 and @xmath24 candidate catalogs as described in m11 . in addition , we also allow for _ xmm _ pi - targeted cluster observations to be included in our final sample ( such systems are noted in table [ fs_details ] ) .",
    "thus , our catalog of fss contains serendipitously discovered fss , as well as previously known groups / clusters which have been re - classified as fss .",
    "since we are studying the stellar populations of fgs , we also required that the brightest galaxy near the center of each candidate have a measured sdss spectrum and we used the redshift of that galaxy to define the redshift of the system .",
    "these constraints complicate the fs selection , and so for this work we avoid making any conclusions which require a known selection function ( e.g. , constraining the number density of fss ) .",
    "we then identified fss by examining the color ",
    "magnitude relation around each candidate .",
    "we used a system similar to the xcs - zoo that is described in detail in m11 .",
    "the main difference being the addition of color  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to help with the estimation of the magnitude gap .",
    "specifically , we visually examined x - ray images and optical color images from the sdss overlaid with x - ray contours .",
    "these x - ray and optical images were created over @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 fields of view . at the same time , we compared the images to the @xmath20 versus @xmath28 cmds using sdss dr7 imaging data .",
    "a system was either designated an fs candidate or not based on the inspection of these images and cmds .",
    "to be classified as an fs candidate the system must satisfy the following criteria .    * _ optical . _ a bright elliptical galaxy at or near the location of the x - ray source . *",
    "_ x - ray .",
    "_ obviously an extended source , e.g. , rather than a blend of point sources ( see m11 ) .",
    "_ @xmath29 in the @xmath25 image .",
    "it has recently been noted that the sdss photometry systematically underestimates the luminosities of nearby bcgs @xcite with the discrepancy being a function of bcg radius .",
    "this problem affects dr7 , which we use , and is best described in the `` imaging caveats '' page of dr8 .",
    "therefore , we use a magnitude gap of only 2.0 when selecting the fs candidates , instead of the adopted gap of 2.5 , to allow for the correction of this problem @xcite .",
    "all sources were examined by at least three coauthors and those that were classified as an fs candidate at least twice ( @xmath30 in total ) were then examined more closely .    defining magnitude gaps in clusters",
    "requires accurate measures of @xmath22 , @xmath7 , and the magnitudes of the galaxies , as well the ability to reject foreground / background galaxies .",
    "therefore , the fs candidates that passed the above initial criteria were then put through the xcs analysis pipelines in order to measure @xmath13 and @xmath7 ( see section [ xcs ] for more details ) .",
    "after doing so , we re - calculated the cmds using the estimated @xmath22 values ( specifically , out to @xmath1 ) .",
    "we discuss the robustness of our sample and results to changes to @xmath22 in appendix [ robust ] .",
    "we also applied background corrections to the magnitudes of the large central galaxies using the algorithm defined in @xcite and tested in @xcite .",
    "the average size of this correction is 0.3 mag but could be as large as 1.0 mag .",
    "we note that many existing fs samples that rely on sdss data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have not made this important correction .",
    "this would result in incorrect fg luminosities ( which , as we shall see in section [ assem ] , is a significant fraction of the total system luminosity ) , smaller magnitude gaps , and lower levels of completeness .",
    "only then were we able to measure the magnitude gap from the brightest central galaxy out to some physical distance . in estimating the magnitude gap we only considered galaxies that were within @xmath31 from the @xmath28 color of the central galaxy",
    "this is reasonably generous since the scatter in the red sequence is found to be less than half this amount .",
    "we also discarded galaxies from the cmds that had sdss spectroscopic redshifts @xmath32 km s@xmath5 away from the central galaxy .",
    "for those galaxies with a photometric redshift @xcite , we discarded galaxies beyond @xmath33 .",
    "this cut is conservative since the average photometric redshift error for galaxies with @xmath34 is 0.04 .",
    "no difference in the number of systems classified as fossils was found when this photometric redshift cut was doubled to @xmath35 .",
    "this resulted in a clean ( but possibly incomplete ) sample of 17 fs .",
    "this iterative procedure is important and it allowed us to rigorously check which of the 60 fs candidates were in fact true fss .     are classified as fss .",
    "the system with the arrow is xmmxcs  j124425.9 + 164758.0 , which has a highly uncertain sky - subtraction correction that we elect not to apply .",
    "if we apply the correction ( of 1.0 mag ) then this results in a magnitude gap of 3.3 , as denoted by the thin arrow .",
    "the other system is xmmxcs  j172010.0 + 263724.7 , which has a magnitude gap @xmath36 and is close enough to 2.5 that we accept it as an fs .",

    "the magnitude gap is unaffected by the errors on @xmath22.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the positions of these systems in the parameter space used to define fss are shown in figure [ lx_gap ] .",
    "the red circles are our sample while the blue squares are the xcs - dr1 groups / clusters of m11 ( see section [ bcgs ] for more details ) .",
    "the horizontal and vertical dashed lines denote the optical and x - ray criterion respectively ; points that lie above and to the right of these lines are classified as fss .",
    "there are two systems that have @xmath37 , which we accept as fss .",
    "the system with the arrow is xmmxcs  j124425.9 + 164758.0 ( hereafter referred to simply as j124425.9 ) , which has an fg with a double nucleus .",
    "this makes the sky - subtraction correction highly uncertain and so we elect not to apply it .",
    "if we were to apply the estimated correction of 1.0 mag then @xmath38 changes from 2.3 to 3.3 , which is denoted by the thin arrow in figure [ lx_gap ] .",
    "even if we only apply the average sky - subtraction correction of the other 16 fss ( 0.3 mag ) then @xmath39 and so we accept j124425.9 as an fs .",
    "the other system is xmmxcs  j172010.0 + 263724.7 , which actually has a magnitude gap @xmath36 and is close enough to 2.5 that we accept it as an fs too .",
    "our results do not change if these two fss are excluded .",
    "we note that four fss were targeted for observation by _",
    "xmm _ and are thus not a part of the xcs - dr1 , which includes only serendipitously discovered clusters .",
    "these targeted systems are labeled in table [ fs_details ] and our conclusions are unaffected if we exclude them from our analyses .    for three fss , there are galaxies near @xmath1 , such that a slightly smaller @xmath22 excludes one or more of them as members or a slightly larger @xmath22 includes one or more of them as members",
    ". if the galaxy is among the four brightest in the system then this can have the effect of increasing or decreasing the magnitude gap , respectively .",
    "we show the magnitude of this systematic effect in figure [ lx_gap ] ( thick arrows ) after changing @xmath22 by one standard deviation of its statistical error ( see section [ errors ] ) .",
    "the magnitude gaps for the other 14 fss are unaffected by the statistical uncertainties on @xmath22 .",

    "the most commonly used definition of an fs was first set out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the exact definition is given in the introduction ) .",
    "for a system to be classified as an fs in this study it must have @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 and a magnitude gap of 2.5 in the @xmath20 band between the brightest and the fourth brightest galaxies located within half the virial radius , which we denote as @xmath21 . as mentioned in the introduction , one of the main reasons why there are so few confirmed fss in the literature is the lack of high quality x - ray data .",
    "low s / n x - ray data make it extremely difficult to not only detect extended sources but to also estimate their luminosity .",
    "it is for this reason that many samples are defined as ` optical fossil ' samples , i.e. , samples that are only known to satisfy the optical criterion .",
    "the source detection algorithm used in the xcs , the xcs automated pipeline algorithm ( xapa ) , has made this project possible .",
    "many difficulties can arise when trying to detect and measure x - ray sources , which usually have low counts : a point - spread function and sensitivity that varies over the instrument s field - of - view ; deblending of point and extended sources ; and background determination to name but a few ( ld11 , m11 ) .",
    "however , once in possession of accurate @xmath7s determining whether or not a system satisfies the x - ray criterion is a straight forward matter .",
    "determining whether or not the optical criterion is satisfied , however , is a more complicated matter . to be able to determine the magnitude gap of a system requires an estimate of the virial radius and redshift information for each of the galaxies , which is required to determine whether a galaxy is a member of the system or not .",
    "many fs studies start with the @xcite definition and then modify it in various ways depending on circumstances .",
    "for example , if no estimate of the virial radius is available then a fixed aperture may be used .",

    "* ) but to date no study has been done on the robustness of the fs definition . in this appendix",
    "we test the robustness our fs classifications by varying some of the parameters used during the search for fss , e.g. , the size of the redshift cuts .",
    "we also investigate how the results of this study change when we ( 1 ) use different radii to define the magnitude gap of our systems and ( 2 ) use the @xcite magnitude gap instead of the @xcite .    in this study we relied on the redshift data provided by the sdss to determine membership .",
    "specifically , any galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift less than @xmath40 km s@xmath5 or a photometric redshift less than @xmath41 away from the potential fg was considered a system member .",
    "given that the average photometric redshift error for our sample was 0.04 , this cut is quite a generous and errs on the side of caution .",
    "the magnitude gap was then calculated based on the galaxies that populated the red sequence of the systems cmd , within @xmath31 mag in color of the potential fg .    to test the robustness of our classifications we varied some of these values to see how that would affect the classifications .",
    "we varied the spectroscopic - redshift cut in steps of 250 km s@xmath5 up to 2000 km s@xmath5 and the search radius in steps of @xmath42 from @xmath42 to @xmath22 .",
    "we also considered two values for the color cut , 0.15 and 0.2 mag , and the photometric redshift cut , @xmath43 and 0.2 .",

    "we find that this small shift in the @xmath22@xmath13 scaling relations only weakly affects our sample definition and induces only a small amount of scatter into relevant figures .",

    "the other two estimators , the fixed 0.5 mpc aperture and the @xmath45 estimate , produce larger effects . compared to our sample of 17 fss , the former finds only 13 and the latter finds 21 , i.e. , the number of fss found at these extremes is @xmath48 of that found in this study .",
    "the reason for the decrease in the case of the fixed 0.5 mpc aperture is due to the fact that almost half of our sample have @xmath1 less than 0.5 mpc .",
    "the search radius is therefore larger than necessary and includes more galaxies , which results in a smaller magnitude gap .",
    "the reason for the increase in the case of the @xmath22 estimates from the @xmath45@xmath22 relation is most likely due to the fact that true fss , if they are the end - products of galaxy merging in groups / clusters , should have an @xmath22 that is too large for their richness compared to that of normal groups / clusters .",
    "therefore if such a relation , based on normal groups / clusters , is used then the @xmath22 estimates ( and the search radii ) will be too small resulting in larger magnitude gaps .",
    "such a shift in sample size will have a significant impact on the results of an fs number density studies .",
    "these two estimators also introduce scatter into many of the tight relations that fss were found to follow .",

    "note that using @xmath45 to estimate @xmath22 , as we do here , changes the radius within which we calculate @xmath49 ( and therefore changes @xmath50/@xmath49 ) , but should not affect @xmath13 because at these radii the @xmath13 profile should be flat . in the case of the left plot",
    "the scatter in this relation ( for both fss and xcs clusters ) increases from 0.2 dex to 0.25 dex when using @xmath45 to estimate @xmath22 .",
    "note that by using @xmath45 , we are also entirely removing any induced correlation between @xmath49 and @xmath51 in figure [ tx_ltot ] , since the radius we used to calculate @xmath49 is independent of @xmath51 ( see section [ assem ] ) .",
    "so the small increase in scatter in figure a2 compared to figure 6 could be from removing this correlation . in the right plot ,",
    "apart from the increased scatter , we also see a boosting of the fraction at high @xmath13 because these systems are richer and therefore a small decrease in radius can reduce the number of galaxies used to calculate the magnitude gap more than for a low-@xmath13 system .",
    "this results in a smaller @xmath49 and a correspondingly larger fraction of the system light being contained in these dominant galaxies .",
    "if we use the @xcite magnitude gap rather than the @xcite magnitude gap we find that less systems are classified as an fs ( @xmath52 less ) and we lose some statistical power .",
    "there are no changes to the overall results of this study but we find that the tight trends we find for fss ( such as in figure [ frac_opt_tx ] ) are now more sparsely populated as some of our fss have been re - classified as non - fss .",
