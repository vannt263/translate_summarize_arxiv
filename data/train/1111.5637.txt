    "secondary interactions amongst the system s constituents can convert the initial coordinate - space anisotropy to a momentum - space anisotropy in the final state  @xcite . in this case , the _ spatial _ anisotropy decreases as the system expands so that any observed _ momentum _ anisotropy will be most sensitive to the early phase of the evolution before the spatial asymmetry is smoothed  @xcite .",
    "ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions at brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite are studied in part to deduce whether quarks and gluons become deconfined during the early , high energy - density phase of these collisions . since the azimuthal momentum - space anisotropy of particle production is sensitive to the early phase of the collision s evolution ,",
    "observables measuring this anisotropy are especially interesting .",
    "the azimuth angle ( @xmath12 ) dependence of the distribution of particle momenta can be expressed in the form of a fourier series  @xcite : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is either the reaction - plane angle defined by the beam axis and the impact parameter vectors , or the participant plane angle defined by the beam direction and the minor axis of the overlap zone  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the positions of nucleons within the colliding nuclei can cause deviations between the reaction plane angle and the participant plane angle and the non - sphericity of the colliding nuclei may also enhance this effect . when energy is deposited in the overlap region by a finite number of collision participants ,",
    "the energy density will necessarily possess a lumpiness associated with statistical fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations will lead to eccentricity fluctuations which can lead to @xmath0 fluctuations . by definition ,",
    "the eccentricity is maximum when calculated with respect to the participant plane .",
    "this plane shifts away from the reaction plane due to fluctuations .",
    "it is expected that this larger , positive definite eccentricity will drive the anisotropic expansion thought to be responsible for @xmath0  @xcite . the eccentricity calculated with respect to the participant axis",
    "is called @xmath15 and the eccentricity calculated with respect to the reaction plane is called @xmath16 .    the fourier coefficients @xmath17 can be measured and used to characterize the azimuthal anisotropy of particle production .",
    "measurements of @xmath6 @xcite have been taken to indicate the matter created in collisions at rhic behaves like a perfect liquid with a viscosity - to - entropy ratio near a lower bound @xmath18 derived both from the uncertainty principle @xcite and string theory @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is primarily based on hydrodynamic model predictions @xcite .",
    "uncertainty about the conditions at the beginning of the hydrodynamic expansion , however , leads to large uncertainties in the model expectations @xcite .",
    "since @xmath6 reflects the initial spatial eccentricity of the overlap region when two nuclei collide , fluctuations of @xmath6 should depend on fluctuations in the initial eccentricity .",
    "measurements of the system - size and energy dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath6 fluctuations are therefore useful for understanding the initial conditions of the expansion phase of heavy - ion collisions .    methods used to study @xmath6  @xcite are based on correlations either among produced particles or between produced particles and spectator neutrons detected near beam rapidity @xmath19 .",
    "estimates of @xmath6 from produced particles can be biased by correlations which are not related to the reaction or participant plane ( nonflow @xmath20 ) and by event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus , an explicit measurement of @xmath21 would require a measurement of nonflow and fluctuations .",

    "the upper limit assumes that @xmath0 fluctuations dominate the sum @xmath36 .",
    "this is a robust upper limit since larger values of @xmath35 would require negative values of nonflow contrary to expectations and to measurements of two - particle correlations  @xcite .",

    "other sources besides eccentricity fluctuations contribute to @xmath0 fluctuations , the inferred nonflow would need to become even smaller .",
    "while the uncertainties arising from the geometric description of the au nucleus preclude a definitive statement , it appears likely that the mcg - n model over - predicts the ratio of eccentricity fluctuations to the mean eccentricity .",

    "the smaller relative fluctuations for the constituent quark participant model means this model would be consistent with larger nonflow values than the nucleon participant model .",
    "the required nonflow values are essentially positive at all measured multiplicities .",
    "this means this model has a better chance of accommodating the near - side two - particle correlations observed in data .",

    "it remains to be seen if a consistent determination of two- and four - particle cumulants related to @xmath0 , @xmath0 fluctuations and nonflow can be derived from a cgc model with radially boosted flux tubes .",

    "[ fig1a ] ( top ) we show the ratio of @xmath1 determined from the q - distribution analysis and the q - cumulants analysis .",
    "deviations between the q - distribution and q - cumulants results can be seen when the multiplicity of the event is smaller with the q - distribution results being smaller than the q - cumulants results .",
    "these deviations can be traced to the break - down of the large n approximation required when fitting the q - distribution .",
    "an attempt is made to correct for this break - down which brings the results closer together but the deviations are still significant for multiplicities below 150 .",
    "the correction is carried out by adjusting the q - distribution data before it is fit .",
    "the correction is derived by taking the ratio of the expected and observed q - distribution from simulated data .",
    "although the correction extends the apparent validity of the q - distribution analysis to lower multiplicities , we find that the q - distribution analysis is less reliable than the q - cumulants analysis .    figure  [ fig1a ] ( bottom ) shows the ratio of the quantity @xmath45 from the q - distribution fits over the same from the q - cumulants analysis .",
    "data are from 200 gev au+au and cu+cu collisions .",
    "the two methods produce significantly different results for @xmath45 with the difference most pronounced in cu+cu and peripheral au+au collisions .",
    "the q - distribution gives smaller values .",
    "this is related to the large n approximation required in the fitting procedure for the q - distribution .",
    "when multiplicity is low , the tails of the q - distribution can not be populated .",
    "we find that this leads to a narrowing of the observed distribution relative to the fit function and the width of the distribution determines @xmath45 .",
    "the q - distribution fits therefore underestimate @xmath45 , so we use the results from the q - cumulants calculation in this paper .",
    "we use three monte - carlo models to study eccentricity and eccentricity fluctuations . the first two are glauber models which either treat nucleons as participants or constituent quarks within the nucleons as participants ( mcg - n and mcg - q respectively ) .",
    "the third model is the factorized kharzeev , levin , and nardi color glass condensate model ( fkln - cgc )  @xcite .",
    "the input parameters used for the woods - saxon distribution of nucleons are in table ii .",
    "the au nuclei have been assumed spherical for the eccentricity calculations .",
    "a 0.4 fm exclusion radius is used in the calculations so that nucleons do not overlap in coordinate space .",
    "the mcg - n model is described elsewhere  @xcite and is used to calculate the @xmath63 and @xmath129 values in table  [ cent ] . for the mcg - q model ,",
    "we first distribute nucleons inside a nucleus according to a woods - saxon distribution with parameters taken from  @xcite , then we distribute three constituent quarks inside each nucleon according to another woods - saxon distribution where the radius of the nucleon is taken to be 0.63 fm and the surface width is 0.08 fm .",
    "the results were not very sensitive to variations of these parameters within a reasonable range .",
    "one might consider a gaussian for the quarks instead of a woods - saxon distribution .",
    "the woods - saxon distribution gives a more flat - topped distribution but the calculated eccentricity and eccentricity fluctuations are not highly sensitive to the exact distribution .",
    "the main feature of the mcg - q model is that the potential number of participants increases by a factor of three and there are large correlations between participants because the quarks are confined within the nucleons .",
    "the woods - saxon parameters from  @xcite are based on measurements of electron scattering which are only sensitive to protons .",
    "if the au nucleus has a neutron skin , then the hadronic radius may be larger than that quoted in  @xcite .",
    "we estimated the systematic errors by varying the woods - saxon parameters within the range allowed by electron scattering data .",
    "although unmeasured , theoretical guidance suggests the neutron skin may add 0.2 fm to the radius of heavy nuclei  @xcite . to account for a possible neutron skin , we increased the radius of the au nucleus to 6.7 fm .",
    "we find that our results only weakly depend on the radius and depend mostly on the diffuseness parameter `` a '' .",
    "the effect of a neutron skin is therefore well within our quoted systematic errors and will not affect our conclusions unless the skin significantly changes the diffuseness at the edge of the nucleus .",
    "the fkln - cgc model provides multiplicity and eccentricity .",
    "our mcg calculations use a two - component model and a negative binomial distribution to estimate the event multiplicity for each simulated event .",
    "the first parameter of the binomial distribution is generated for each event using      where @xmath131 , @xmath129 is the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath63 is the number of participating nucleons , and @xmath132 is the fraction of the multiplicity proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "then multiplicity is generated by sampling a negative binomial distribution with parameters @xmath133 and width @xmath134 for each participant .",
    "this parametrization provides a good description of multiplicity measurements in heavy - ion collisions from @xmath135 to @xmath136 gev  @xcite and for all centralities . for the mcg - q model , while the eccentricity is defined by the locations of constituent quarks participating in the collisions , the multiplicity is defined by the nucleon @xmath63 and @xmath129 .",
    "we define the centrality of the models according to this multiplicity so that the data and model are treated equivalently . in this way",
    ", our eccentricity fluctuations also contain the impact parameter and @xmath63 fluctuations that are intrinsic to our experimental determination of a given centrality interval .",
    "the uncertainties on the models were estimated by varying the woods - saxon parameters within the range of the errors quoted in ref .",
    "we also varied the parameters for the multiplicity but the results were not very sensitive to those .",
    "several different variables related to the eccentricity have been calculated from the three models .",
    "this includes the eccentricity relative to the reaction - plane ( @xmath137 ) , the eccentricity relative to the participant plane ( @xmath15 ) , and the two- and four - particle cumulants of @xmath15  @xcite : @xmath138 @xmath16 for 200 gev au+au collisions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig23 ] ( top ) .",
    "@xmath16 is largest for the fkln - cgc model and smallest in the mcg - n model .",
    "the mcg - q model is intermediate between the two .",
    "the relevant quantities have been tabulated online  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig23 ] ( bottom ) shows the fluctuations of @xmath139 for the three models for 200 gev au+au collisions .",
    "the fluctuations in the two glauber models are larger than those for the fkln - cgc model .",
    "one might expect the mcg - q model to have smaller fluctuations than the mcg - n model since there are three times as many possible participants .",
    "this is counterbalanced however by two effects 1 ) the three constituent quarks are confined inside nucleons thus inducing correlations that partially offset the effect of more participants , and 2 ) the mean value of the eccentricity is larger in the mcg - q model .",
    "these effects lead to the result that the width of the eccentricity distribution in the mcg - q model and the mcg - n model are similar . on the other hand ,",
    "since the mcg - q model gives a larger average eccentricity , when considering @xmath140 , the mcg - q model is intermediate between the fkln - cgc and the mcg - n models as one might naively expect .",
    "the trends for cu+cu collisions remain the same as for au+au collisions with the fkln - cgc model having the largest eccentricity and smallest fluctuations and the mcg - q model intermediate between the mcg - n and fkln - cgc models .",
    "none of the models showed a significant difference between @xmath141 and 200 gev , so we only show the 200 gev results here .",

    "@xmath142 shows positive values throughout the range and decreases with increasing centrality .",
    "the mcg - n model shows smaller values than the other two models for central and mid - central collisions but cross fkln - cgc for the most peripheral collisions .",
