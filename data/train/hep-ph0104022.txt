    "duality is a much used and much abused concept . in some cases",
    "it is used to describe an equivalence between quark- and hadron - based pictures which is trivial ; in others an equivalence which is impossible . in almost all cases , the conceptual framework in which duality is discussed and used is either hopelessly muddled or hopelessly abstract .",
    "nevertheless , the data indicate that some extremely interesting and potentially very important `` duality '' phenomena are occurring at low energy .",
    "we begin by making the trivial observation that any hadronic process can be correctly described in terms of quarks and gluons , assuming that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the correct theory for strong interactions . while this statement is obvious , it rarely has practical value , since in most cases we can neither perform nor interpret a full qcd calculation .",
    "we will refer to the above statement that any hadronic process can be described by a full qcd calculation as `` degrees of freedom duality '' : if one could perform and interpret the calculations , it would not matter at all which set of states  hadronic states or quark and gluon states  was used .",
    "on the other hand , there are rare cases where the average of hadronic observables is described by a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculation .",
    "we reserve the use of the term `` duality '' to describe these rare correspondences , in contrast to the trivial `` degrees of freedom duality '' described above . in these rare cases",
    ", a quark - gluon calculation leads to a very simple description of some phenomenon even though this phenomenon `` materializes '' in the form of hadrons .",
    "deep inelastic scattering is the prototypical example , and the one on which we focus here .",
    "these rare examples are all characterized by a special choice of kinematic conditions which serve to expose the `` bare '' quarks and gluons of the qcd lagrangian . in the case of deep inelastic scattering ,",
    "the kinematics are such that the struck quark receives so much energy over such a small space - time region that it behaves like a free particle during the essential part of its interaction .",
    "this leads to the compellingly simple picture that the electron - nucleon cross section is determined in this kinematic region by free electron - quark scattering , i.e. duality is exact for this process in this kinematic regime .    for inclusive inelastic electron scattering from a proton in the scaling region ,",
    "the cross section is determined by the convolution of a non - perturbative and currently difficult to calculate parton distribution function with an electron - quark scattering cross section determined by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "for semileptonic decays of heavy quarks , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath0 , one can prove using pqcd that the decay rate is determined by that of the underlying heavy quark , in this case obtained from the process @xmath1 @xcite . in @xmath2 , it is the underlying @xmath3 process that applies because of pqcd .",
    "however , while duality applies to all of these phenomena , we will see that even in these special processes we must invoke an averaging procedure to identify the hadronic results with the quark - gluon predictions .",
    "in addition to its need of an averaging procedure , it is easy to see that the pqcd picture of inelastic electron scattering must fail for @xmath4 . for duality to hold for the nucleon structure functions in this case , the elastic electric proton and neutron form factors , which take the value of the nucleon charges for @xmath5 , would have to be reproduced by electron scattering off the corresponding @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks .",
    "this is possible for the proton since the squares of the charges of two @xmath6 quarks and one @xmath7 quark add up to 1 @xcite .",
    "however , for the neutron , the squared quark charges can not add up to 0 , so it is clear that local duality in inclusive inelastic electron scattering from a neutron must fail for @xmath4 . also , we know that duality must fail for polarized structure functions at low @xmath8 , as the ellis - jaffe sum rule and the gerassimov - drell - hearn sum rule , which can be written as integrals over @xmath9 at different @xmath8 , are negative ( gdh sum rule for @xmath10 ) and positive ( ellis - jaffe sum rule at @xmath8 of several gev ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus duality in inelastic electron scattering has to hold in the scaling regime and must in general break down at low energy .",
    "obviously , a very interesting question is what happens in between these regimes , _",
    "i.e. _ how does duality break down ?",
    "this paper answers this question , which is not only interesting in itself , but also crucial for practical , quantitative applications of duality .",
    "we begin by discussing the issue of averaging .",
    "if duality is relevant at all at low energy , then it is quite obvious that we need to perform some sort of average : the smooth , analytic pqcd prediction can not in general correspond exactly to the generally highly structured hadronic data . for low energies this requirement",
    "is universally accepted ; however , even in the `` scaling '' region one must average in principle . to see this , consider qcd in the large-@xmath11 limit @xcite .",
    "we can do this because no element of the pqcd results for deep inelastic scattering depends on the number of colors .",
    "however , in this limit the hadronic spectrum consists entirely of infinitely narrow noninteracting resonances @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , there are only infinitely narrow spikes in the @xmath12 hadronic world .",
    "since the quark level calculation still yields a smooth scaling curve , and the kinematic conditions for being in the scaling region are unchanged as @xmath12 , we see that we must average even in the scaling region . while in nature",
    ", the resonances have fairly broad decay widths so that the averaging takes place automatically in the data , the large @xmath11 limit shows us that averaging is always required in principle .",
    "it is thus clearly important to be able to define this averaging procedure , _ _",
    "e.g. _ _ , how large the intervals must be and which resonances have to be included .",
    "it is easy to see that this procedure will not be universal , and will certainly not simply be that the resonances one - by - one locally average the pqcd - derived scaling curve : the averaging method will depend on the process and on the target .",
    "consider , as an illustration of these points , the case of a spinless quark and antiquark with charges @xmath13 and @xmath14 and equal masses bound into a nonrelativistic @xmath15 system .",
    "the inelastic electron scattering rate calculated at the quark level in leading twist will then be proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "since the elastic state will be produced with a rate proportional to @xmath17 , it clearly can not in general be locally dual to the scaling curve @xcite .",
    "how then is duality realized in this system ? consider the charge operator @xmath18 : from the ground state it excites even partial wave states with an amplitude proportional to @xmath19 and odd ones with an amplitude proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "thus the resonances build up a cross section of the form @xmath21 and one can see by explicit calculations in models that ( up to phase space factors ) the cross terms in this sum will cancel to give a cross section proportional to @xmath16 once averaged over nearby even and odd parity resonances .",
    "it is clear that such target- and process - dependence is worthy of study .",
    "however , in this paper we will restrict ourselves to a model with @xmath22 so that local duality might apply @xcite .",
    "the question of the validity of low energy duality , _",
    "i.e. _ , duality in electron scattering at finite beam energies in inelastic electron scattering after suitable averaging , is as old as the first inclusive electron scattering experiments themselves .",
    "it begins with the seminal paper of bloom and gilman @xcite , which made the observation that the inclusive @xmath23 structure function in the resonance region at low @xmath8 generally oscillates about and averages to a global scaling curve which describes high @xmath8 data .",
    "more recently , interest in bloom - gilman duality has been revived with the collection of high precision data on the @xmath23 structure function from jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "these data not only confirmed the existence of bloom - gilman duality to rather low values of @xmath8 , but also seem to demonstrate that for the proton the equivalence of the averaged resonance and scaling structure functions holds also for each resonance so that duality also exists locally .",
    "here we present a model for the study of quark - hadron duality in electron scattering that uses only a few basic ingredients .",
    "namely , in addition to requiring that our model be relativistic , we assume confinement and that it is sufficient to consider only valence quarks ( this latter simplification being underwritten , as mentioned previously , by the large @xmath11 limit ) .",
    "in addition , since our model is designed to explore conceptual issues and not to be compared to data , and since we postpone addressing spin - dependent issues to later work , for simplicity we also take the quarks , electrons and photons to be scalars . a model with these features will not give a realistic description of any data , but it should allow us to study the critical questions of when and why duality holds . while this model is extremely simple ,",
    "we see no impediment to extending it to describe a more realistic situation since we find that duality arises from the most basic properties of our model .",
    "we make several more convenient simplifications .",
    "although it is our aim to study duality in electron scattering from the nucleon , _",
    "i.e. _ from a three - quark - system , as a first step we study these issues in what is effectively a one quark system by considering such a quark to be confined to an infinitely massive antiquark . in the case of scalar quarks considered here",
    ", we can therefore describe the system by the klein - gordon equation .",
    "we also select for our confining potential one which is linear in @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a generalized , relativistic string constant .",
    "this choice allows us to obtain analytic solutions , without which the required numerical work for this study would be daunting .",
    "indeed , the energy eigenvalues , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mass of interacting quark , can be readily obtained by noting the similarity to the schrdinger equation for a non - relativistic harmonic oscillator potential : the solutions for the wave functions are the same as for the non - relativistic case .    in the next section",
    "we construct the structure function out of resonances described by form factors , each of which individually gives vanishing contributions at large momenta , and show that it both scales and , when suitably averaged , is equal to the `` free quark '' result .",
    "an analysis in terms of structure function moments is presented in section iii . in section",
    "iv we examine the onset of scaling , and the appearance of bloom - gilman duality , while in section v we discuss the connection of bloom - gilman duality with duality in heavy quark systems .",
    "finally , in section vi we summarize our results and mention some possible directions for future research .",
    "the differential cross section for inclusive inelastic scattering of a `` scalar electron '' _ via _ the exchange of a `` scalar photon '' is @xmath29 where the scalar coupling constant @xmath30 carries the dimension of a mass , and the factor multiplying the scalar structure function @xmath31 corresponds to the mott cross section . in a model",
    "where the only excited states are infinitely narrow resonances , @xmath32 is given entirely by a sum of squares of transition form factors weighted by appropriate kinematic factors : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , the form factor @xmath35 represents a transition from the ground state to a state characterized by the principal quantum number @xmath36 , and the sum over states @xmath36 goes up to the maximum @xmath37 allowed kinematically .",
    "note that for fixed , positive @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the excitation form factors can be derived using the recurrence relations of the hermite polynomials .",
    "one finds : @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "this form factor is in fact the sum of all form factors for excitations from the ground state to degenerate states with the same principal quantum number @xmath36 . as a precursor to our discussion of duality",
    ", we note that it will be a necessary condition for duality that these form factors ( or more generally those corresponding to some other model potential ) can represent the pointlike free quark .",
    "it is in fact the case that @xmath42 as @xmath43 , a relation which follows from the completeness of the confined wave functions .",
    "incidentally , an examination of the convergence of this sum as a function of @xmath44 is sufficient to make the point that reproducing the behavior of a free quark requires more and more resonances as @xmath45 increases ( details of this will be discussed in a forthcoming publication ) .    scaling in the presence of confining final state interactions",
    "has previously been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite , where similar conclusions are reached .",
    "this suggests that scaling may indeed be a trivial feature of a large class of simple quantum mechanical models .",
    "some sense of how this can occur can be obtained by considering some of the properties of the relativistic oscillator model used in this paper . in particular , consider the properties of the square of the form factors . for a fixed principal quantum number , @xmath36 , the form factor has a maximum in @xmath46 at @xmath47 . using @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "so the position of the peak in the averaged structure function occurs at @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a scaled bjorken scaling variable @xmath54 which takes into account that as the mass of the antiquark @xmath55 , the constituent quark will carry only a fraction of order @xmath56 of the hadron s infinite - momentum - frame momentum .",
    "furthermore , for fixed @xmath57 the structure function falls off smoothly for energy transfers away from the peak value .",
    "the width of this peak as a function of energy transfer also becomes constant for large @xmath46 .",
    "now consider the integral of the structure function @xmath58 where @xmath59 with @xmath60 , and where @xmath61 .",
    "since the form factor sum for a fixed @xmath57 peaks about @xmath62 , we can substitute @xmath63 and then sum over the complete set of final states to give @xmath64 for large momentum transfer .",
    "therefore , if we define the scaling function as @xmath65 , as will be done below , the area of the scaling function becomes constant at large momentum transfer .",
    "since the scaling function peaks at fixed @xmath66 , smoothly falls about the peak , has fixed width and constant area at large momentum transfer , the model scales .",
    "it is a common misconception that the presence of scaling implies that the final states must become plane waves .",
    "in fact , the argument above makes it clear that scaling occurs when the structure function becomes independent of the final states as in the closure approximation used here .    to see duality clearly both experimentally and theoretically",
    ", one needs to go beyond the bjorken scaling variable @xmath67 and the scaling function @xmath68 that goes with it .",
    "this is because in deriving bjorken s variable and scaling function , one not only assumes @xmath8 to be larger than any mass scale in the problem , but also that high @xmath8 ( pqcd ) dynamics controls the interactions .",
    "however , duality has its onset in the region of low to moderate @xmath8 , and there masses and violations of asymptotic freedom do play a role .",
    "bloom and gilman used a new , _ ad hoc _ scaling variable @xmath69 @xcite in an attempt to deal with this fact .",
    "in most contemporary data analyses , the nachtmann variable @xcite is used together with @xmath70 .",
    "nachtmann s variable contains the target mass as a scale , but neglects quark masses . for our model",
    ", the constituent quark mass ( assumed to arise as a result of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ) is vital at low energy , and a scaling variable that treats both target and quark masses is desirable .",
    "such a variable was derived more than twenty years ago by barbieri _",
    "@xcite to take into account the masses of heavy quarks ; we use it here given that after spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking the nearly massless light quarks have become massive constituent quarks , calling it @xmath71 : @xmath72 the scaling function associated with this variable is given by : @xmath73 this scaling function and variable were derived for scalar quarks which are free , but have a momentum distribution .",
    "the derivation of a new scaling variable and function for bound quarks will be published elsewhere .",
    "numerically , this scaling variable does not differ very much from the one in eq .",
    "( [ defxdis ] ) .",
    "of course all versions of the scaling variable must converge to @xmath67 and all versions of the scaling function must converge towards @xmath70 for large enough @xmath8 .",
    "one can also easily verify that in the limit @xmath74 one obtains from ( [ defxdis ] ) the nachtmann scaling variable . in the following ,",
    "we use the variable @xmath71 and the scaling function @xmath75 .",
    "we are now ready to look at scaling and duality in our model .",
    "since the target has mass @xmath76 , it is convenient to rescale the scaling variable @xmath71 by a factor @xmath77 : @xmath78 the variable @xmath6 takes values from 0 to a maximal , @xmath8 dependent value , which can go to infinity .",
    "the high energy scaling behavior of the appropriately rescaled structure function @xmath79 is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the structure function has been evaluated using the phenomenologically reasonable parameters @xmath80  gev and @xmath81 , though we remind the reader not to compare our results , which might resemble electron scattering from a @xmath82 meson , to nucleon data ! to display it in a visually meaningful manner , the energy - dependent @xmath83-function has been smoothed out by introducing an unphysical breit - wigner shape with an arbitrary but small width , @xmath84 chosen for purposes of illustration : @xmath85 where the factor @xmath86 } $ ] ensures that the integral over the @xmath83-function is identical to that over the breit - wigner shape .",
    "the curves in fig .  1 show that scaling sets in rather rapidly .",
    "the resonances show up as bumpy structures in the low @xmath8 region ( which will be discussed in section iv below ) , a trace of which is visible for the @xmath87  gev@xmath88 curve .    by taking the continuum limit for the energy and applying stirling s formula",
    ", one can obtain an analytic expression for the scaling curve , valid in the scaling region , for the transition of the quark from the ground state to the sum of all excited states : @xmath89 of course we still need to verify that this scaling curve as seen in fig . 1 found by summing over hadrons is the same as the one which we would obtain from deep inelastic scattering off the quark , _ _ i.e. _ _ , if we were to switch off the potential in the final state . in this case , the tower of hadronic states is replaced by the free quark continuum .",
    "duality predicts that the results should be the same in the scaling limit , and by direct calculation we confirm this .",
    "bloom - gilman duality relates structure functions at low and high @xmath8 averaged over appropriate intervals of the hadronic mass @xmath90 . as a quantitative measure of this feature of the data ,",
    "one conventionally examines the @xmath8-dependence of moments of structure functions .",
    "the moments offer the cleanest connection with the operator product expansion of qcd , and provide a natural connection between duality in the high- and low-@xmath8 regions . by considering the moments",
    ", we also remove artifacts introduced through the smoothing procedure described above for the structure function itself .",
    "the moments of the structure function @xmath91 are defined as : @xmath92 where @xmath93 corresponds to the maximum value of @xmath6 which is kinematically accessible at a given @xmath8 .",
    "evaluating the moments of the structure function ( [ s ] ) explicitly one has ( provided the kinematics allow us to access all excited states ) : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the elastic contribution to the moments",
    "is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the position in @xmath6 of the ground state .",
    "note that @xmath99 becomes independent of @xmath100 in the limit @xmath5 , approaching unity and that the inelastic contributions to the moments vanish for vanishing @xmath8 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the @xmath101 , 4 , 6 and 8 moments @xmath102 as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "all the moments appear qualitatively similar , rising to within about 10% of their asymptotic values by @xmath103 gev@xmath88 . also evident",
    "is the fact that the lower moments reach their asymptotic values earlier than the higher moments .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the expectation from the operator product expansion discussed in @xcite , where it was argued that the effective expansion parameter in the twist expansion @xmath104 , so that for higher moments , @xmath100 , the higher twist terms survive to larger values of @xmath8 .    unfortunately , these moments do not have such useful interpretations here as they do in real deep inelastic scattering .",
    "for example , the analog of the gross - llewellyn smith sum rule is not applicable here because the scalar current which couples to our quark is not conserved . nonetheless , the moments in fig .",
    "[ figmom1dist ] do serve to demonstrate that scaling is a natural consequence of our model , and illustrate the relative onset of scaling for different moments .",
    "after studying the scaling behavior of the structure functions in our model at high @xmath8 and the moments over a range of four - momentum transfers , we now study the structure functions at low @xmath8 where not only in the large @xmath105 limit but also in nature resonances are visibly dominant over a wide range in the scaling variable . here",
    ", we consider a target where only one quark carries all the charge of the system , so there is no forced breakdown of duality at @xmath10 of the type noted earlier for the neutron .",
    "still , one can not expect that the perturbative qcd result will describe even averaged hadronic observables well at very low @xmath8 : these are after all strong interactions !",
    "if local duality holds , one might expect the resonance  spikes \" to oscillate around the scaling curve and to average to it , once @xmath8 is large enough .",
    "( we remind the reader that while scaling in deep - inelastic electron scattering from the nucleon is known from experiment to set in by @xmath106  gev@xmath88 , the target considered here corresponds to an infinitely heavy `` meson '' composed of scalar quarks interacting with a scalar current , so one should not expect numerically realistic results , only qualitative ones . )",
    "figure  3 shows the onset of scaling for the structure function @xmath75 as a function of @xmath6 , as @xmath8 varies from 0.5  gev@xmath88 to 2  gev@xmath88 . as in fig .  1",
    ", for each of the resonances ( excluding the elastic peak ) the energy @xmath83-function has been smoothed out using the breit - wigner method with a width @xmath107  mev .",
    "with increasing @xmath8 , each of the resonances moves out towards higher @xmath6 , as dictated by kinematics . at @xmath10 ,",
    "the elastic peak is the only allowed state and contributes about 44% of the asymptotic value of @xmath108 .",
    "it remains rather prominent for @xmath8 = 0.5  gev@xmath88 , though most of @xmath108 is by this point built up of excited states , and it becomes negligible for @xmath109 2.0 gev@xmath88 .",
    "remarkably , the curves at lower @xmath8 do tend to oscillate ( at least qualitatively ) around the scaling curve , as is observed in proton data .",
    "note that these curves are at fixed @xmath8 , but sweep over all @xmath110 . in a typical low energy experiment , @xmath111 will also be limited ; in such circumstances these curves still apply , but they get cut off at the minimum value of @xmath6 that is kinematically allowed . for another perspective on these curves , note that @xmath112 so for fixed @xmath8 , as @xmath110 is increased so that more and more highly excited states are created , the struck quark is being hit harder and harder .",
    "in contrast , the structure function @xmath70 when plotted as a function of the scaled bjorken variable @xmath66 shows very poor duality between its low- and high-@xmath8 behaviors , as seen in fig .  4 .",
    "one of the reasons for this failure is that @xmath67 and @xmath70 know nothing about the constituent quark mass , while low energy free quark scattering certainly does , so the corresponding pqcd cross section calculated neglecting the quark mass is simply wrong at low energy .",
    "we have seen that low - energy ( bloom - gilman ) duality is displayed by our model in terms of the appropriate low - energy variable @xmath6 and described some of the physics behind this duality ( completeness of the bound state wave functions to expand a plane wave and an approximate closure based on the required expansion states being in a narrow band of @xmath110 relative to those that are kinematically allowed ) . to obtain a deeper understanding of the physics behind low energy duality , it is instructive to compare and contrast duality in electron scattering with that in heavy quark decays .",
    "we will begin by carefully examining duality in heavy - light systems , where it is exact in the heavy quark limit even down to zero recoil , and where the mechanisms behind this exact duality are very clear .",
    "duality in heavy quark systems is easily understood intuitively .",
    "consider a @xmath113 system where @xmath114 , and imagine that @xmath115 can decay to @xmath116 by emitting a scalar particle @xmath117 of mass @xmath118 : @xmath119 .",
    "( note that in this case it is the heavy quark that interacts with the current and not the light quark as in our model ! ) at the free quark level , the decay of @xmath115 at rest will produce the @xmath117 with a single sharp kinetic energy @xmath120 and corresponding @xmath116 recoil velocity @xmath121 .",
    "( we use the standard variables @xmath120 and @xmath121 , but others , like the @xmath117 recoil momentum , could be chosen . ) in reality , since the heavy quarks are bound into mesons , @xmath117 will ( in the narrow resonance approximation ) emerge from the decay at rest of the initial meson s ground state @xmath122 with any of the sharp kinetic energies allowed by the processes @xmath123 as determined by the strong interaction spectra of these two mesonic systems . since in the heavy quark limit @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 ,",
    "the hadronic spectral lines are guaranteed to cluster around @xmath120 , and to coincide with it exactly as @xmath127 . moreover , since @xmath128 , one can show using an analog of the operator product expansion @xcite that the strong interactions can be neglected in calculating the total decay rate ( _ _ i.e. _ _ , the heavy quarks @xmath115 and @xmath116 are so heavy that the decay proceeds as though it were free . )",
    "thus the sum of the strengths of the spectral lines clustering around @xmath120 is the free quark strength : there is perfect low energy duality as @xmath129 .",
    "what is now especially interesting is to unravel this duality to understand how the required `` conspiracy '' of spectral line strengths arises physically . because the heavy quark is so massive ,",
    "if it would as a free particle recoil with a velocity @xmath121 , then this velocity would be changed only negligibly by the strong interaction since in the heavy quark limit it carries off a negligible kinetic energy , but a momentum much larger than @xmath130 . in the rest frame of the recoiling meson",
    ", this configuration requires that the two constituents have a _ relative _ momentum @xmath57 which grows with @xmath121 .",
    "_ thus the strong interaction dynamics is identical to that of our model in which the relative momentum @xmath57 is supplied by the scattered electron .",
    "_ moreover , in this case , with duality exact at all energies , we can reconstruct exactly how it arises .",
    "what one sees is remarkably simple @xcite . at low @xmath121 corresponding to low @xmath57",
    ", only the ground state process @xmath131 occurs . since the masses and matrix elements for the transitions @xmath131 and @xmath132 are identical ( the elastic form factor goes identically to unity as @xmath133 ) , the hadronic and quark spectral lines and strengths are also identical and duality is valid at @xmath134 !",
    "next consider duality at a different kinematic point ( which one might reach by choosing a smaller @xmath117 mass ) where @xmath121 and therefore @xmath57 have increased .",
    "the elastic form factor will fall , so its spectral line ( which is still found at exactly the new value of @xmath120 in the heavy quark limit ) will carry less strength .",
    "however , once @xmath135 differs from zero , excited states @xmath136 can be created , and indeed are created with a strength that exactly compensates for the loss of elastic rate",
    ". these excited state spectral lines also coincide with @xmath120 and duality is once again exact .",
    "indeed , no matter how large @xmath137 becomes , all of the excited states produce spectral lines at @xmath120 with strengths that sum to that of the free quark spectral line .",
    "heavy quark theory also allows one to go beyond the heavy quark limit to the case of quarks of finite mass . in this case one of course finds that duality - violation occurs , but that it is formally suppressed by two powers of @xmath138 @xcite , with the spectral lines now clustered about @xmath120 but not coinciding with it .",
    "a remarkable feature of this duality violation is that the spectral line strengths differ from those of the heavy quark limit in ways that tend to compensate for the duality - violating phase space effects from the spread of spectral lines around @xmath120 .",
    "an additional source of duality - violation is that some of the high mass resonances that are required for exact duality are kinematically forbidden since for finite heavy quark masses @xmath139 is finite .    from this discussion",
    "it is clear that the strong interaction dynamics of heavy - light decays is the same as that of scattering a probe off of the @xmath116 of a @xmath140 system @xcite : what is relevant is that the system must in each case respond to a relative momentum kick @xmath57 .",
    "needless to say , one must still carefully organize the kinematics to expose duality : in a decay to a fixed mass @xmath117 only a single magnitude @xmath141 is produced at the quark level , while in electron scattering a large range of @xmath141 and @xmath110 is produced by a given electron beam .    given these connections ,",
    "it is relevant to note that in addition to the obvious conceptual relevance of heavy - light systems , model studies indicate that in these systems heavy quark behavior continues to hold qualitatively even for @xmath142 .",
    "these models are , as one might expect , similar to ours which displays the same clustering of spectral lines , the same tendency for excited state spectral lines to compensate for the fall with @xmath141 of lighter states , and the same sources of duality violation such as kinematically forbidden states and mismatches between the mass of the recoiling hadrons and the struck quark .",
    "we believe that these elements of the dynamics are clearly in operation and that we have understood through our model that the qualitative applicability of duality for real systems should indeed extend all of the way down to zero recoil as seen in nature .",
    "we have presented a simple , quantum - mechanical model in which we were able to qualitatively reproduce the features of bloom - gilman duality .",
    "the model assumptions we made are the most basic ones possible : we assumed relativistic , confined , valence scalar quarks and treated the hadrons in the infinitely narrow resonance approximation .",
    "to further simplify the situation , we did not consider a three quark `` nucleon '' target , but a target made up by an infinitely heavy antiquark and a light quark . the present work does not attempt to quantitatively describe any data , but to give qualitative insight into the physics of duality .",
    "our work complements previous work on duality , where the experimental data were analyzed in terms of the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "there , it was observed that at moderate @xmath8 , the higher twist corrections to the lower moments of the structure function are small .",
    "the higher twist corrections arise due to initial and final state interactions of the quarks and gluons .",
    "hence , the average value of the structure function at moderate @xmath8 is not very different from its value in the scaling region . while true",
    ", this statement is merely a rephrasing in the language of the operator product expansion of the experimentally observed fact that the resonance curve averages to the scaling curve .",
    "however , the operator product expansion does not explain why a certain correction is small or why there are cancellations : the expansion coefficients which determine this behavior are not predicted .",
    "the numerical confirmation of these coefficients will eventually come from a numerical solution of qcd on the lattice , but an _ understanding _ of the physical mechanism that leads to the small values of the expansion coefficient will almost certainly only be found in the framework of a model like ours .",
    "for example , one clear lesson from our study of duality is that the commonly made sharp distinction between the `` resonance region '' , corresponding to an invariant mass @xmath143 gev for scattering from a proton , and the deep inelastic region , where @xmath144 gev , is completely artificial .    finally , we remind the reader that our model , with all the charge on a single quark , with scalar currents , and with no spin degrees of freedom , leaves much to be done in model - building .",
    "the next step is to use more realistic currents . while making the calculations more complicated , coupling to the conserved quark current",
    "will allow one to study the @xmath8-evolution of the gross - llewellyn smith and momentum sum rules . to use a spin-@xmath145 target",
    "will also be a useful step forward , but it may require foregoing the great advantages of the analytic solutions of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "as we have emphasized , the local duality seen here _ can not _ be expected for more complicated targets and processes , and pursuing this issue is also clearly very important @xcite .",
    "here we have taken a first small step which nevertheless has been enough to strongly suggest that for these more realistic models and more general processes there will be a generalization of local averaging  a theoretically well - defined procedure for integrating over regions of @xmath71  which will also display low energy duality .",
    "if so , we will not only have understood quark - hadron duality .",
    "we will also have opened the door to extending studies of a variety of structure functions into previously unreachable kinematic regimes .",
