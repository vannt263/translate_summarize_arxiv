    "probes of the filaments require efficient algorithms for finding filaments .",
    "several sophisticated algorithms for identifying filaments , both in the three dimensions and two dimensions , have been developed .",
    "generally , there are three types of algorithms to identify a filament based on : ( 1 ) the distribution of galaxies or clusters of galaxies @xcite ; ( 2 ) the gravitational tidal tensor  the hessian of the gravitational potential @xcite ; and ( 3 ) the velocity field induced from the dynamics of the underlying density field @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the line - of - sight velocities @xmath1 of the galaxies around a cluster of galaxies with the projected distances to the cluster center satisfying @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the virial radius , are as a function of @xmath4 , if the galaxies are arranged in one filament or sheet , since these galaxies are gravitationally affected by the cluster .",
    "therefore they plotted the @xmath5 map for the galaxies , and identified the filamentary structures on the map as filaments or sheets ( see the paper of falco et al .",
    "2014 for details ) .",
    "they proved that the line - of - sight velocities can be probes of filaments and sheets .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a new method of identifying filaments using the orientations of galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the spin axes of bright spiral galaxies have a weak tendency to be aligned parallel to filaments , while the major axes of elliptical / s0 galaxies are significantly aligned with their host filaments .",
    "therefore the galaxies alignment may be an additional probe of filaments .",
    "we describe the method , and apply it to the galaxies assembled around the coma cluster in section 2 .",
    "the results are compared with the detected standard filaments using the method of @xcite in this section , and discussed in section 3 . in section 4 , we summarize the work .",
    "we adopt the wmap7 cosmological parameters : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "for the galaxies arranged in a filament , the major axes of red galaxies and spin axes of blue galaxies are related to their host filaments , e.g. , the major axes of the elliptical / s0 ( red ) galaxies are significantly aligned with the orientations of the filament @xcite . therefore , according to the distribution of orientations of the projected red galaxies , we may identify the filaments in two - dimensional ( 2d ) images .    in order to quantitatively indicate the orientations of the projected ellipses , we define the east direction in the celestial coordinate system as @xmath9-axis , and the north direction as @xmath10-axis , and define the position angle of a red galaxy , @xmath11 , as the angle between the major axis of the projected ellipse and the @xmath9-axis , as shown in fig .",

    "the overall orientations of filaments are clearly revealed by the red bars . according to the average orientations ,",
    "there are two main filaments in w1 ( f1 and f2 ) , and also two filaments , or more precisely , two sheets ( s1 and s2 ; the filaments are located in the planes of the sheets ; falco et al .",

    "these filaments are circled by the blue lines in fig .",
    "[ f_ori ] . for each filament",
    ", we also plot the distribution of orientations of the red bars in the filament region , as shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ f_ori ] .",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov test ( k - s test ) is performed to detect the deviation of each orientation distribution from a uniform distribution , and the @xmath59 values of all of the four distributions are small ( @xmath60 for f1 , @xmath61 for f2 , @xmath62 for s1 , and @xmath63 for s2 ) , suggesting that the orientations of the red galaxies in each filament are indeed anisotropic .",
    "the method of @xcite can only identify the filaments gravitationally bound to the clusters of galaxies , i.e. , only the galaxies whose radial velocities are influenced by the gravity from the cluster matter can be detected ; whereas lam can theoretically find all of the filaments either influenced or not by the gravity of the clusters , since the orientations of red galaxies are not related directly to the gravity of the clusters of galaxies .",
    "therefore the low value of @xmath54 in w1 might indicate that there are some galaxies located in filaments but not or only weakly influenced by the gravity of the coma cluster in w1 .",
    "we are interested in whether the selected galaxies are due to both the alignments and inhomogeneous distributions of the galaxies in the 2d image , or just due to the latter .",
    "for example , perhaps the detected filament ( sheet ) s1 in w2 is identified because of the high number density of galaxies in the @xmath64 radius range rather than the alignments of red galaxies . in order to test the effect of alignment ,",

    "we find that the filaments can also be identified with the @xmath46 confidence level ; however the detection efficiency ( @xmath55 ) is much worse than that by lam .",
    "the effect of alignments can be characterized by the fraction @xmath66 , where @xmath53 and @xmath67 are the numbers of detected galaxies by lam and alignments only ; @xmath68 for w1 , and @xmath69 for w2",
    ". therefore the galaxies selected by alignments account for substantial parts of the galaxies selected by lam , suggesting that the alignments of red galaxies play an important role in lam .",
    "the galaxies alignments and 2d distributions of galaxies are independent of the redshifts , therefore we expect that lam should be still effective without the information of redshifts of the galaxies .",
    "however in this case , some interlopers , i.e. , the foreground and background galaxies , will be included .",
    "the orientations of the foreground and background galaxies should be isotropic , if there is no strong gravitational lens in front of these galaxies , and the galaxies are not arranged in other filaments .",
    "therefore the interlopers may be contaminations for lam . with these in mind",
    ", we retrieve the catalog of galaxies around the coma cluster ( within @xmath18 ) from sdss dr12 again , without restricting the range of redshifts . in order to reduce the contamination of the interlopers in the image , the range of the @xmath4 band magnitudes of the selected red galaxies need to be carefully chosen . here",
    "we only use the bright red galaxies within @xmath70 to detect the filaments , where the faint end of @xmath71 is brighter than the previous value of @xmath72 , since the alignments of the brighter red galaxies are more significant @xcite , and a brighter faint end induces fewer background interlopers ; the other selecting criteria of the red galaxies remain unchanged .",
    "we apply lam to the new sample of red galaxies , and the result for each wedge ( w1 and w2 ) is also compared with the standard filaments , which is listed in the last column of table  [ n_comp ] .",
    "we find that the results for both w1 and w2 are slightly worse than the results of redshifts restricted ; however , the detection efficiency ( 83.0% for w1 , 87.9% for w2 ) is also acceptable .",
    "additionally , @xmath54 ( 56.3% for w1 , 84.0% for w2 ) for each wedge is also close to that with the redshifts restricted ( 58.3% for w1 , 79.7% for w2 ) , implying that the selected filaments without the redshifts information of galaxies are almost the same as those with the redshifts restricted .",
    "we find that , in w1 and w2 , 24 and 15 galaxies of the selected red galaxies by lam ( with @xmath46 confidence level ) are not found without the redshifts information , respectively . among these red galaxies which are not found without using the redshifts information , 18 ( for w1 ) and 11 ( for w2 )",
    "galaxies are fainter than @xmath73 , suggesting that these galaxies are not found is mainly due to the fact that their magnitudes are out of range .",
    "therefore the results without the redshifts information are slightly worse than the results of lam , because some faint ( @xmath74 ) galaxies are not included in the sample ( @xmath70 ) we used here .      without restricting the redshifts of galaxies ,",
    "we select @xmath75 red galaxies in w1 , and @xmath76 galaxies in w2 . among these selected red galaxies , 72 ( for w1 ) and",

    "we directly plot the orientations of the possible background interlopers for w1 and w2 in fig .",
    "[ ori_inter ] , and find that the orientations of the possible background interlopers tend to be parallel to the overall orientations of filaments . in order to test whether the tendency is caused by physical reasons or just by accident , we need to study the orientations of the all possible background red galaxies ( @xmath77 , @xmath70 ) behind the four filaments / sheets .",
    "first , we choose all possible background red galaxies ( @xmath77 , @xmath70 ) in the four filament regions in the 2d image as circled by the blue lines in fig .",

    "the uniform distribution ( @xmath80 ) may be due to the small number of statistics .",
    "therefore for detecting f2 , the effect of the possible background galaxies is not clear . for s1 and s2 regions ,",
    "the possible background interlopers are more likely to be selected by accident , because of the high values of @xmath59 ( @xmath81 for s1 region , @xmath82 for s2 region ) .",
    "therefore for detection of s1 and s2 , the possible background interlopers are contaminations .",
    "there are some possible mechanisms that may result in the relatively significant alignment signal of the possible background galaxies behind f1 .",
    "for example , according to many previous papers about the effect of gravitational lensing , theoretically the images of background galaxies might be stretched along the orientation of the foreground filament by the shear of the filament ( e.g. , higuchi et al .",
    "however , the gravitational lensing by filaments is extremely weak @xcite , and changes the observed ellipticity of a background galaxy by only @xmath83 @xcite , where @xmath84 is the shear of gravitational lensing .",
    "therefore it is very unlikely that gravitational lensing contributes to the detected significant alignment signal shown in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ ori_bg ] .",
    "another possibility is that if some member galaxies in f1 are classified as background galaxies even if @xmath77 , these galaxies may result in the detected alignment signal . in order to test this possibility",

    "to further test whether the excess in fig .",
    "[ dis_z ] really reveals a filament ( f1 ) , we use lam again with the red galaxies in f1 region with @xmath91 ( the redshift range of the excess in fig .",

    "[ ori_nf ] .",
    "we find that f1 is indeed detected with these galaxies , suggesting that the excess in fig .",

    "the @xmath59 value ( @xmath78 ) is smaller than that with @xmath92 ( @xmath60 as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_ori ] ) , also indicating that the red galaxies with @xmath93 in f1 region indeed are member galaxies of f1 .",
    ", from the upper to lower panels , we plot the orientations of the selected ( with @xmath0 confidence ) red galaxies with @xmath91 in f1 region , average orientation in each spatial cell , and distribution of the average orientations .",
    "the result of k - s test is illustrated by the @xmath59 value . ]",
    "therefore for w1 , we need to subtract the galaxies with @xmath93 from the eleven selected background galaxies shown in fig .",
    "[ ori_inter ] . after removing these galaxies",
    ", we find that the contaminations by the left background interlopers are not strong when lam is used without the information of galaxy redshifts , since there are only seven ( @xmath94 of the total selected galaxies ) and four ( @xmath95 of the total selected galaxies ) background interlopers in w1 and w2 , respectively .",
    "therefore , an advantage of lam is that the method is independent of the redshifts of galaxies , and thus can be applied to detecting filaments at relatively high redshifts , where there are photometric images but lack of spectroscopic data and thus the previous algorithms of detecting filaments ( e.g. , using the velocities field ) fail .",
    "since the red galaxies are preferentially aligned with their host filaments , we developed a new method , called location - alignment - method ( lam ) , of detecting filaments around clusters of galaxies , which uses both the alignments of the red galaxies and their distributions in 2d images .",

    ". the contaminatons by background interlopers are not strong .    in conclusion",
    ", there are two main advantages of lam : ( 1 ) lam can clearly reveal the number and overall orientations of the detected filaments ; ( 2 ) lam is independent of the redshifts of galaxies ; therefore , we can use lam to select the red galaxies in filaments among the sample of galaxies without the information of redshifts .",

    "<S> the orientations of the red galaxies in a filament are aligned with the orientation of the filament . </S>",
    "<S> we thus develop a location - alignment - method ( lam ) of detecting filaments around clusters of galaxies , which uses both the alignments of red galaxies and their distributions in two - dimensional images . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , the orientations of red galaxies are used as probes of filaments . </S>",
    "<S> we apply lam to the environment of coma cluster , and find four filaments ( two filaments are located in sheets ) in two selected regions , which are compared with the filaments detected with the method of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that lam can effectively detect the filaments around a cluster , even with @xmath0 confidence level , and clearly reveal the number and overall orientations of the detected filaments . </S>",
    "<S> lam is independent of the redshifts of galaxies , and thus can be applied at relatively high redshifts and to the samples of red galaxies without the information of redshifts .    </S>",
