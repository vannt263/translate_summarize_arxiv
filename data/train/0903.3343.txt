    "more precisely , in characteristic zero the two are equivalent and so fubini s theorem is satisfied , whereas in finite characteristic the possible presence of wild ramification implies that , for any euler characteristic , interchanging the order of integration is not always permitted .    the third section discusses a notion weaker than the full fubini property ( a so - called strong euler characteristic @xcite @xcite ) , but which is sufficent for our applications . we show that over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero , there is exactly one strong euler characteristic ( over the complex numbers , this is the usual topological euler characteristic ) .",

    "but the argument of the first paragraph of theorem [ theorem_euler_characteristic_is_usual_one ] , which is valid for any strong euler characteristic , establishes that @xmath258 for @xmath236 .",
    "if @xmath259 then a strong euler characteristic does exist on the structure of constructible sets , namely the topological euler characteristic .",
    "this follows from the classical result that if @xmath260 is an @xmath11-sheeted covering of a cw - complex @xmath49 , then @xmath261 .    the lefschetz principle ( i.e. that the first order theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero is complete ; see @xcite for a classical discussion of this principle ) now implies that a strong euler characteristic exists for any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero .    the inclusion of this material is inspired by @xcite and @xcite , where strong euler characteristics ( in fact , the definition of strong in these papers is slightly stronger than the definition given here ) are discussed from the perspective of model theory . in @xcite , it is proved that a universal strong euler characteristic @xmath262 exists , and so our previous theorem and remark prove that if @xmath43 is algebraically closed of characteristic zero , then @xmath263 .",
    "now we generalise the results of the previous section from curves to surfaces .",
    "@xmath43 continues to be an algebraically closed field , and @xmath55 is a fixed @xmath56-valued euler characteristic on the structure of constructible sets . in this section",
    ", surface means a smooth , two - dimensional , irreducible algebraic variety over @xmath43 , whereas a curve is merely a one - dimensional , reduced , algebraic variety over @xmath43    if @xmath264 is a finite morphism between projective surfaces of degree @xmath11 , then let @xmath265 be the set of @xmath266 such that @xmath107 does not contain @xmath11 points .",
    "zariski s purity theorem ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "8.2.15 ) or @xcite ) states that @xmath31 is pure of dimension one ; let @xmath267 be its irreducible components , and let @xmath268 be the degree of the morphism @xmath269 ( note that the degree is well - defined , as the base curve is irreducible , though the covering curve @xmath270 may be reducible ) . using this data",
    "we may prove an analogue of lemma [ lemma_fubini_formula_for_curves ] :    let @xmath264 be a finite morphism between projective surfaces , with notation as in the previous paragraph .",
    "then fubini holds for @xmath105 ( in the same sense as the previous section ) if and only if the following formula relating @xmath271 and @xmath272 is satisfied : @xmath273 where @xmath274 denotes the number of local branches of @xmath275 at @xmath114 . if @xmath55 is a strong euler characteristic then this formula holds .",
    "the normalisation of @xmath31 is by definition @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is the normalistion of the irreducible curve @xmath275 .",
    "write @xmath278 , and let @xmath279 be its normalisation in the same way as @xmath31 ; the functoriality of normalising implies that there is an induced morphism @xmath280 such that @xmath281 .",
    "let @xmath282 be a large enough finite set of points such that @xmath283 includes all singular points of the curve @xmath31 , @xmath284 includes all singular points of the curve @xmath285 , and @xmath286 includes all points of ramification of @xmath287 .",
    "then @xmath288 and @xmath289 induce isomorphisms @xmath290 and @xmath291 ; therefore @xmath292 further , as we saw in the proof of lemma [ lemma_fubini_formula_for_curves ] , @xmath293 since @xmath294 , we have @xmath295 ; combining the last few identities gives @xmath296    to complete the proof , combine this identity with @xmath297 where @xmath298 denotes the number of irreducible components of @xmath31 which pass through @xmath116 ( note that @xmath299 ) .",
    "when @xmath259 and @xmath300 is the topological euler characteristic , which we have remarked earlier is a strong euler characteristic , then the theorem proves that @xmath301 the lefschetz principle now implies that the formula remains true if we replace @xmath43 by any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero , and @xmath302 by the @xmath303-adic euler characteristic ( = alternating sum of betti numbers of @xmath303-adic tale cohomology of @xmath304 , = degree of the second chern class of @xmath304 ) .",
    "this generalisation of the riemann - hurwitz formula to surfaces is due to b. iversen @xcite , who established it with purely algebraic techniques by studying pencils of curves on the surfaces .",
    "iversen remarks in his paper that a more topological proof should be possible when @xmath259 , and our approach provides that .    a natural question now to ask",
    "is whether an analogue of the theorem holds in higher dimensions .",
    "if @xmath305 is a finite morphism between @xmath97-dimensional smooth projective varieties over @xmath43 , then the branch locus will be pure of dimension @xmath306 , so one can hope to obtain results by induction on dimension . the difficulty which appears when the branch local has dimension @xmath307 is that there is no functorial way to desingularise .",
    "it is unclear to the author at present how significant a problem this is .",
    "another interesting question concerns the situation in characteristic @xmath200 .",
    "we noted in remark [ remark_wild_ramification ] that , for curves , the difference between the euler characteristic and the integral over the fibres was a measure of the wild ramification . for surfaces ,",
    "the situation is more complex , since the wild ramification of surfaces is not fully understood .",
    "however , assuming that there is no ferocious ramification present ( this is when inseparable morphisms between curves appear ) , i.  zhukov @xcite has successfully generalised iversen s formula by defining appropriate ramification invariants ; this provides an explicit formula for @xmath308 in terms of the wild ramification of the cover .",
    "the most interesting related problem is the local situation ; that is , ramification of local fields .",
    "fix a complete discrete valuation field @xmath126 with perfect residue field @xmath309 , and let @xmath310 denote its algebraic closure .",
    "fix a finite galois extension @xmath311 with galois group @xmath312 , and define the usual ramification objects as follows : @xmath313 one proves that @xmath314 is a strictly increasing , piecewise linear , function @xmath315 , and defines the _ hasse - herbrand _",
    "function @xmath316 to be its inverse .",
    "upper ramification on the galois group is defined by @xmath317 .",
    "we now explain a geometric interpretation of these formulae .",
    "since @xmath309 is perfect , @xmath318 is monogeneic ; let @xmath319 be a chosen generator , with minimal polynomial @xmath320 $ ] .",
    "extend @xmath321 to all of @xmath310 to give a @xmath322-valued valuation ; we will write @xmath323 for any real number @xmath324 to denote the closed ball of radius @xmath324 . by some rigid geometry , model theory , or explicit calculations ,",
    "it is known that @xmath325 may be written in a unique way as a disjoint union of closed balls .",
    "let @xmath326 denote this set of balls , and note that @xmath312 acts on it transitively since each ball contains at least one root of @xmath17 .",
    "so , for any @xmath327 , the kernel of the action of @xmath312 on @xmath331 is @xmath332 .",
    "further , the definition of the hasse - herbrand function implies that @xmath333 at least away from the ramification breaks , and therefore that @xmath334 since both sides are @xmath335 at @xmath336 .",
    "but @xmath337 , and so @xmath338 for all @xmath327 .",
    "if we think of `` the number of connected components '' as a measure , then ( @xmath339 ) is a repeated integral taken over certain fibres .",
    "this geometric approach to ramification is used by a.  abbes and t.  saito @xcite @xcite to develop ramification theory for complete discrete valuation fields with imperfect residue field , using rigid geometry .",
    "l.  xiao has written a good overview @xcite of their theory and established integrality of various conductors @xcite @xcite .",
    "i would not have been able to give the discussion above without the help of g.  yamashita .",
    "perhaps it is possible to replace the rigid geometry techniques by model theory , using the rich model theoretic structure of algebraically closed valued field , just as we have explored ramification of surfaces using the model theory of algebraically closed fields .              , measure , integration and elements of harmonic analysis on generalized loop spaces , in proceedings of the st .",
