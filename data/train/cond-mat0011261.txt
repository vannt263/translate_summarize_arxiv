    "strongly correlated electrons show a rich variety of physical properties , e.g.  heavy fermion behavior , partial localization and unconventional superconductivity .",
    "ab initio _ electronic structure calculations performed for these systems have proven to be unable to capture the essential features of these systems .",
    "the reason for this is mainly that the lda underestimates the strong correlations caused by the local part of the coulomb interaction among the electrons .",
    "the standard model for the lanthanides corrects for this via imposing a condition on the -electrons which is not present in the standard lda dft scheme : i ) @xmath0-electrons should be treated as atomic like and localized ; ii ) the @xmath0-shell contains an integral number , @xmath1 , of electrons .",
    "however , it has been argued  @xcite , that already the cohesive properties signal a deviation from the standard model .    in a previous paper  @xcite , we presented an idea how normal band structure calculations could be extended to treat systems with strongly correlated electrons , that is an improvement on normal methods such as lda+u , sic or treating the f - electrons as atomic like .",
    "indeed it was demonstrated that the cohesive properties , such as e.g.  equilibrium volume is better described with this method .",
    "the calculation  @xcite has been performed within the linear muffin - tin orbital method within the spherical approximation ( lmto - asa ) .",
    "the comparison with the results of normal lmto - asa calculation has shown that the latter contains two type of errors : one comes from the spherical approximation and another from the underestimated electron correlations .",
    "here we have implemented these many - body corrections in a full - potential all - electron relativistic energy band method , in order to obtain a description as accurate as possible , and we have tested our theory for the light lanthanides .",
    "these elements are an excellent testing ground for any theory that tries to incorporate electron correlations , since so much is known experimentally about them .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to test our theory on these materials , before addressing more involved systems such as the heavy fermion materials , upt@xmath2 and cecu@xmath3si@xmath3 and possibly the @xmath4-phase of pu .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the equations that form the ground for the calculations , in section iii we describe the details of the numerical implementation , and section iv contains the results .",
    "finally we conclude in section v.",
    "the main motivations of this work are to derive expressions for corrections from strong electron correlations to standard methods of _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "we also want to make an attempt to understand , from a many - body theory point of view , the mechanism of localization of f - electrons , that may be described phenomenologically by self - interaction correction ( sic ) , and the so called lda+u method .",
    "as we shall see the method allows us to capture features of correlated systems such as e.g. the correlation narrowing of bands .",
    "the full description of our approach , as well as notations , will be given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we present here only some of the theoretical details , how we have implemented the theory numerically as well as the results of some of our calculations .",
    "we formulate the problem following the ideology presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , that the one - to - one correspondence between the arf ( the approximation of renormalized fermions  @xcite ) series and the one from weak - coupling perturbation theory allows to use the same analytical form for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "moreover , our theory includes renormalized mixing , hopping , overlap matrixes and charge density , by the spectral weights of the many - electron ion states that we involve .",
    "the arf can be viewed as the hubbard - i approximation which is extended to the case of full coulomb interaction .",
    "this approximation is the simplest possible , but since it is exact in the atomic limit it is expected to give reasonable results in the case of very strong correlations .",
    "now let us establish a connection between the secular equations solved in electronic structure calculations ( esc ) and green function methods for strongly correlated electrons .",
    "in order to do this we need to define the hamiltonians for the two problems .",
    "first , when solving the kohn - sham equation we have to solve a secular equation , which looks like , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the overlap matrix between the cite - centered basis - functions , @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the site index and @xmath9 is a composite index @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the energy for the orbital , and @xmath12 is the hamiltonian matrix element which will be defined below .",
    "let us first consider the -electrons as localized .",
    "we , therefore write the hamiltonian for the band structure method with the -electrons separated from the other conduction electrons . denoting the operators for - and conduction - electrons with @xmath0 and @xmath13 , respectively , the esc hamiltonian is @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrix elements comes from the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to the basis functions @xmath15 the index @xmath9 is used solely for conduction electrons .",
    "we denote the -   hopping by @xmath16 and the mixing between @xmath13 and @xmath0 by @xmath17 .",
    "combined indices for the s are denoted with @xmath18 .",
    "the operators fulfill the commutation relation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is either a @xmath21 or an -operator .",
    "the hamiltonian , eq.([matrix_elements : eq ] ) , is a dft hamiltonian using either lda or any other approximation for the exchange - correlation potential , i.e.@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the exchange correlation potential and @xmath24 is the interaction of electrons with nuclei . from these definitions",
    "we can define green functions which we can use to make a comparison to the case for strongly correlated electrons .",
    "obviously , the same problem can be written in terms of green functions ( gfs ) . denoting the fermionic green functions",
    "f and separating the @xmath21 and -electrons we can write the gf , @xmath25 , in super matrix form , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the chronological ordering operator . further , we denote the time fourier transform by a small @xmath28 and @xmath29-space fourier transform with a small @xmath29 . taking into account the commutation relations , eq.([comm : eq ] ) in this representation",
    ", we obtain the equation of motion for the green functions ( the @xmath29 in @xmath30 is omitted for convenience ) : @xmath31 & -[{\\cal o}_{l,\\nu _ 2}^{-1}v_{\\nu _ 2\\nu _",

    "we will work with the multiple - orbital periodical anderson model ( mo - pam ) in terms of hubbard operators .",
    "the latter are defined as projection ( transition ) operators acting on the many - body states of an ion , @xmath32 , in the position @xmath33 , as , @xmath34 here @xmath35 is an n - particle state constructed out of orbitals from the esc , @xmath36 . to simplify the notations we denote the fermi - like transitions @xmath37 $ ] with roman letters @xmath38 . the commutator relation for the @xmath39-operators",

    "the results show a narrowing of the 4-bands compared to lda ( or gga ) results . due to the division of the 4-states in a higher and lower level , we find that the cohesion from the 4-states is non - zero ( in contrast to calculations that treat the 4-states as core states ) but substantially smaller than what it would have been in an lda ( or gga ) calculation .",
    "the present results are rather similar to our previous calculations , that include modifications in an lmto - asa method , although the full - potential treatment does include finer details of the potential . due to the generalization of the corrections to an electronic structure method , that can treat any crystal structure , we believe the present method should have a potential in calculating the electronic structure of -based materials that are hard to treat in a regular lda ( or gga ) esc methods .",
    "we are thankful for financial support from the swedish natural science research council ( nfr and tfr ) , for the foundation for strategic research ( ssf ) and the gran gustafsson foundation . j.m .",
    "wills are acknowledged for supplying the codes for the fp - lmto calculations ."
