    ", these stars could not possibly migrate from the smc since they do not exhibit peculiar velocities sufficient to explain their motion over the large distances they would need to cover . therefore the mb provides the most metal poor gas in our neighborhood to investigate not only the gas , but also to observationally constrain star - formation in low metal and tenuous gas environment .",
