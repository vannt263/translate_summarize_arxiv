    "at some point in their lives , many if not most stars go through an unstable phase which leads to pulsation .",
    "there are many classes of these pulsating stars .",
    "perhaps the most famous are the cepheid variables , which are popular mostly because of their well - defined relationship between stellar luminosity and pulsation period ( typically 550 days ) that makes these stars very useful as distance indicators .",
    "mira variables are another important class of stellar pulsators , having long periods of 150500 days and luminosities that vary by as much as 67 magnitudes from minimum to maximum .",
    "miras are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with masses similar to that of the sun .",
    "they have very massive , slow , cool winds , which produce a complex circumstellar environment .",
    "observations of molecular co lines show that miras are often surrounded by molecular envelopes thousands of au in diameter .",
    "these observations yield estimates of the wind termination velocity and total mass loss rate , which are typically of order 5 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath4 m@xmath5 yr@xmath1 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar envelopes are rich sites for dust formation and are often found to be sources of sio , oh , and h@xmath6o maser emission @xcite .",
    "the massive winds of miras are believed to be driven by a combination of shocks induced by stellar pulsation , and dust formation @xcite .",
    "the shocks lift a substantial amount of material up to 12 stellar radii above the surface of the star .",
    "radiation pressure on dust formed in this material then pushes it away from the star .",
    "the pulsation - induced shocks not only assist in generating the massive winds of miras , but they also determine the atmospheric structure of these stars to a large extent .",
    "thus , understanding the nature of the shocks and measuring their properties is essential to understanding the physics of pulsation and mass loss from pulsating stars .",
    "the ultraviolet spectral regime is an ideal place to study radiation from the shocks .",
    "many uv emission lines are generated from immediately behind the shocks , which are potentially very useful diagnostics for various characteristics of the shocks .",
    "foremost among these lines are the strong mg  ii h & k lines at 2800  .    a large number of uv spectra of miras have been taken by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( iue ) over the years , and some of the basic characteristics of the mg  ii h & k lines have been noted .",
    "it is known , for example , that the mg  ii lines are not visible throughout part of the pulsation cycle .",
    "they typically appear at about pulsation phase @xmath7 , well after optical maximum ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the mg  ii fluxes peak around @xmath9 and then decrease until becoming undetectable at about @xmath10 @xcite .    for a set of lw - hi observations of s  car and r  car",
    ", @xcite showed that the mg  ii h & k lines are blueshifted relative to the stellar rest frame by as much as 100 km  s@xmath1 , and the h line is significantly stronger than the k line .",
    "both of these properties are very difficult to explain , as the shock speeds should be much lower than 100 km  s@xmath1 , and for other astronomical targets the k line is almost always found to be stronger than the h line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    clearly",
    "the unusual behavior of the mg  ii lines of miras should be looked at in more detail to understand the pulsation process . in this paper",
    ", we utilize the extensive iue data sets that exist for 5 miras to fully characterize the behavior of the ultraviolet emission of these stars .",
    "many pulsation cycles are sampled for each star , allowing us to see how the uv emission lines behave from one cycle to the next .",
    "we have searched the iue database for miras that have been extensively observed by the satellite . in this paper , we are only interested in miras without companion stars that may be contaminating the uv spectrum .",
    "we are particularly interested in high resolution spectra taken with iue s long - wavelength cameras ( i.e.  lw - hi spectra ) . with these spectra ,",
    "fully resolved profiles of detected emission lines ( especially mg  ii ) can be analyzed .",
    "however , we also include low resolution , long - wavelength camera spectra ( i.e.  lw - lo spectra ) in our analysis , which can at least be used to measure accurate fluxes of the mg  ii lines and the background .",
    "we only consider large aperture data to ensure that our measured fluxes are accurate .",
    "except for the lyman-@xmath11 line , which is blended with geocoronal emission , no emission lines are typically seen in mira spectra taken with iue s short - wavelength swp camera , so we are not interested in those data .",
    "table 1 lists the five miras with the most extensive sets of iue observations .",
    "( actually , l@xmath12  pup is a semi - regular variable star rather than a mira , but it is a long - period pulsating star similar to miras and it has a very large iue dataset so we include it in our analysis . ) the table gives the position , distance , center - of - mass radial velocity ( @xmath13 ) , and pulsation period of each star .",
    "the distances were taken from the hipparcos catalog @xcite .",
    "the center - of - mass radial velocities of these stars were taken from the simbad database . however , deriving true systemic center - of - mass velocities is difficult for the pulsating miras , because different spectral features observed for these stars exhibit different velocities , and these velocities are often found to vary during the pulsation cycle .",
    "the velocities in table 1 are based on measurements of optical absorption lines of neutral atoms , which provide plausible values for @xmath13 .",
    "other potential measures , such as various optical emission lines , molecular radio emission lines , and maser lines , are generally blueshifted relative to the neutral atomic absorption lines by roughly 510 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these features are probably formed either behind an outward moving shock or in the outer regions of the stellar atmosphere where the massive wind of the star is being accelerated @xcite .",
    "note that infrared co emission lines , which can also be used to estimate stellar center - of - mass radial velocities , generally suggest velocities that are blueshifted relative to the optical velocities by @xmath14 km  s@xmath1 @xcite .    in order to determine how uv emission varies during the pulsation cycle it is necessary to derive accurate pulsation phases , which requires knowledge of the pulsation period and a zero - phase date .",
    "all of the miras in table 1 have been monitored for many decades , and their average periods are well known .",
    "however , the periods of miras can sometimes differ from this average .",
    "therefore , in order to derive the most accurate phases , we sought to determine the average period and zero - phase of our miras during iue s lifetime only ( 19781996 ) .",
    "the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) has a long - term program to monitor hundreds of miras using observations from amateur astronomers around the world @xcite . using aavso data obtained from the world wide web , we derived the pulsation periods listed in table 1 .",
    "the derived periods of s  car , r  car , and r  leo are within a day of the accepted long - term average values ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the derived period of l@xmath12  pup is 4 days shorter and that of t  cep is 11 days longer .",
    "for these two stars , the accuracy of the computed pulsation phases is improved significantly with the use of the derived periods in table 1 . as mentioned above , l@xmath12  pup is a semi - regular variable rather than a traditional mira , but it is similar to miras in other respects so it is included in our sample . because of the irregularity of its period ,",
    "the accuracy of the pulsation phases we derive is limited to about @xmath15 .",
    "the pulsation of the other stars on our list is far more regular , and we estimate that the phases we use for these stars are accurate to within about @xmath16 .",
    "table 1 lists the number of lw - hi and lw - lo spectra available for each star . in each case , the available data provide reasonably good coverage of at least 23 different pulsation cycles .",
    "the data were extracted from the iue final archive .",
    "the spectra in the archive were processed using the newsips software , which became available near the end of the iue s 18-year lifetime in the mid-1990s .",
    "this software corrects the fixed pattern noise problem that plagued spectra processed with the older iuesips software , and improves signal - to - noise by up to a factor of 2 for high resolution spectra .",
    "the newsips software is described in detail by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the behavior of the near uv spectrum of the mira r  car during a typical pulsation cycle in 19861987 .",
    "the primary spectral feature visible in the lw - lo spectra is the mg  ii h & k feature at 2800   , which appears shortly after optical maximum , achieves a maximum flux around @xmath17 , and then declines .",
    "the fe  ii uv1 multiplet lines at 2620    are also visible when mg  ii is at its brightest .",
    "we developed a semi - automated routine to measure the mg  ii fluxes from the lw - lo spectra of our stars .",
    "for each spectrum , the underlying background flux is estimated using the flux in the surrounding spectral region .",
    "the reasonableness of this computed background is verified visually . after subtracting the background from the spectrum , the mg  ii flux",
    "is then computed by direct integration . the error vector provided by the newsips software then allows us to estimate the 1  @xmath18 uncertainty for this flux .",
    "three spectra from r  leo show substantial background emission at an unexpected phase , which we believe indicates contamination by scattered solar light , so these spectra are not used .    in figure 2 , we plot the mg  ii fluxes as a function of pulsation phase for all the stars in our sample .",
    "we use thick symbols to indicate mg  ii lines with 3 or more pixels that have been flagged by newsips as being potentially inaccurate , usually due to overexposure .",
    "these fluxes should be considered more uncertain than the plotted 1  @xmath18 error bars would suggest . in general , however , these fluxes are not wildly discrepant from fluxes of better exposed lines measured closely in time .",
    "dashed lines connect points that are within the same pulsation cycle , excluding cases where the points are separated by over 0.4 phase .",
    "figure 2 shows that the pulsation cycles of each star are all consistent with the general rule of a flux maximum around @xmath0 . however , there are substantial flux differences from one cycle to the next .",
    "the r  car data set shows the most extreme such variability , with the mg  ii fluxes reaching only about @xmath19 ergs @xmath20 s@xmath1 in one cycle and approaching @xmath21 ergs @xmath20 s@xmath1 during another .",
    "in contrast , the mg  ii fluxes of s  car differ by less than an order of magnitude from one cycle to the next , this despite the fact that s  car has one of the largest iue lw - lo databases .",
    "the other relatively short period pulsator in our sample , l@xmath12  pup , seems to behave similarly .",
    "the data points show more scatter for l@xmath12  pup , but this is probably due to inaccuracies in the estimated pulsation phases caused by the irregular period of this star ( see  2 ) .",
    "a comparison of l@xmath12  pup s mg  ii and optical variability has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the phase of maximum mg  ii flux differs somewhat for the five stars , with s  car appearing to have the earliest maximum and r  leo the latest .",
    "one of the brighter mg  ii cycles of r  leo is particularly interesting for showing substantial mg  ii flux very near optical maximum at @xmath22 ( observations lwp21679 and lwp21680 ) .",
    "we generally do not detect significant mg  ii flux this close to @xmath8 for any of our stars ( excluding l@xmath12  pup because of its uncertain phases ) , but apparently there can be exceptions to this rule . by inspecting the aavso light curve we confirmed that the strong mg  ii lines had in fact",
    "been observed very near optical maximum .        turning our attention to the lw - hi spectra , in figures 37 we display the observed mg  ii h & k line profiles for the five stars in our sample . the k line",
    "is shown as a solid line and the h line is represented by a dotted line .",
    "the spectra are shown on a velocity scale in the stellar rest frame , assuming the stellar center - of - mass velocities listed in table 1 , and assuming rest wavelengths in air of 2802.705    and 2795.528    for the h and k lines , respectively .",
    "the date , time , and pulsation phase of each observation are indicated in the figures .",
    "cosmic ray hits , which are apparent in the original spectra as very narrow , bright spectral features not observed in other spectra , have been identified and removed manually .",
    "one s  car spectrum with wildly discrepant properties ( lwp12197 ) was removed from the analysis and is therefore not shown in figure 5 .",
    "many of the s  car spectra were taken with the star deliberately offset within iue s large aperture .",
    "this results in an inaccurate wavelength calibration .",
    "fortunately , there is a set of nine observations taken on 1991 march 913 with different offsets ( see fig .  5 ) . after measuring the centroids of the mg  ii h line ( see below ) , we were able to see from these data how the offsets affected the h line centroid and we used this information to correct the wavelengths of all the s  car spectra obtained with aperture offsets .",
    "the spectra in figure 5 are the corrected spectra .    in almost every spectrum in figures 37 ,",
    "the k line is contaminated by substantial absorption centered at a stellar rest frame velocity of about @xmath23 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this absorption is due to lines of fe  i and mn  i with rest wavelengths in air of 2795.005    and 2794.816   , respectively @xcite . because the mutilation of the k line by these overlying neutral absorbers is generally severe , we focus most of our attention on the more pristine h line .",
    "another concern is interstellar absorption , which should affect both the h and k lines at the same velocity .",
    "the one star whose spectrum we know will _ not _ be affected by the ism is s  car , because its extremely large @xmath24 km  s@xmath1 center - of - mass velocity will shift the mg  ii lines well away from any ism absorption .",
    "the h line of l@xmath12  pup shows absorption at about @xmath25 km  s@xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "the ism velocity predicted for this line of sight by the local ism flow vector of @xcite is @xmath26 km  s@xmath1 after shifting to the stellar rest frame .",
    "thus , it seems likely that this is indeed interstellar absorption , although for lines of sight as long as those towards the stars in our sample , ism components could potentially be present with significantly different velocities than that predicted by the local flow vector .",
    "the h lines of r  leo , r  car , and t  cep do not appear to be contaminated by any obvious ism absorption features .",
    "for r  leo and t  cep , the ism velocities predicted by the local flow vector ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 km  s@xmath1 , respectively ) suggest that the ism absorption may lie outside of the observed mg  ii emission ( see figs .  3 and 6 ) . for the r  car line of sight ,",
    "the local flow vector predicts ism absorption at @xmath29 km  s@xmath1 , which falls just within the red side of the h line .",
    "no obvious absorption is seen , however , suggesting that the ism column density for this particular line of sight may be quite low .",
    "this is not necessarily unusual , as other lines of sight with distances of @xmath30 pc have been found to have very low h  i column densities of @xmath31 @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the mg  ii h line profiles of r  leo , r  car , and t  cep are at most only mildly affected by ism absorption , meaning that for these three stars and s  car we can be reasonably confident that any substantial line profile differences we might find are due to intrinsic differences in the stellar spectra .",
    "the mg  ii h line profiles of these four stars often appear to be slightly asymmetric , with a red side that is steeper than the blue side .",
    "nevertheless , the profiles can be represented reasonably well as a gaussian , and can therefore be quantified with gaussian fits .",
    "we developed a semi - automated procedure to fit all mg  ii h lines detected with enough signal - to - noise ( s / n ) for a meaningful fit to be performed .",
    "the quality of all fits was verified visually .",
    "for spectra without strong mg  ii h lines , we estimated a line flux by direct integration as we did for the lw - lo spectra .",
    "for l@xmath12  pup , we measured h line fluxes for _ all _ the spectra in this manner , since we could not accurately fit gaussians to the ism - contaminated line profiles observed for this star .    in figures 810 , we plot versus pulsation phase the mg  ii h line fluxes , centroid velocities , and widths measured from the lw - hi spectra of the stars in our sample .",
    "as in figure 2 , dotted lines connect points within the same pulsation cycle , and thick data points indicate h lines with three or more pixels flagged as being overexposed .",
    "the 1  @xmath18 uncertainties shown in the figure were estimated using the procedures outlined by @xcite .",
    "the flux variations seen in figure 8 are essentially the same as those seen in the lw - lo data ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "note once again how much the mg  ii fluxes vary from one cycle to the next for r  car .",
    "@xcite found that the mg  ii lines in selected observations of s  car and r  car were substantially blueshifted .",
    "figure 9 demonstrates that this behavior is common to all the mg  ii lines observed by iue for all the miras in our sample .",
    "furthermore , figure 9 also reveals a strong correlation between line velocity and pulsation phase , in which the magnitude of the line blueshifts decreases with pulsation phase .",
    "for example , between @xmath2 and @xmath3 the line velocities of s  car change from about @xmath32 km  s@xmath1 to @xmath33 km  s@xmath1 , and those of t  cep change from @xmath33 km  s@xmath1 to @xmath29 km  s@xmath1 . note that even though we are using gaussians to fit the mg  ii profiles , this does _ not _ imply that mg  ii h & k are optically thin or that the large blueshifts of these lines actually represent gas velocities ( see  3.2.2 ) .",
    "this velocity behavior exactly mimics the behavior of the optical ca  ii h & k lines of miras , which also have blueshifted velocities that typically change from about @xmath32 km  s@xmath1 to @xmath25 km  s@xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , opacity effects and atmospheric flow fields appear to induce the same line behavior in both the mg  ii and ca  ii lines . furthermore ,",
    "many cepheid variables appear to exhibit similar behavior , suggesting that these phase - dependent velocity variations may be typical for stellar pulsators in general @xcite .",
    "the data in figure 9 suggest a possible correlation between pulsation period and line velocity , with the shortest period mira in our sample ( s  car ) having the largest blueshifts , and the longest period star ( t  cep ) having the smallest .",
    "the r  car data suggest another possible correlation . for the pulsation cycle with the largest mg  ii fluxes ,",
    "the mg  ii h lines of r  car are more blueshifted than they are during the weaker cycles .",
    "unfortunately , our sample of stars and the number of well - sampled pulsation cycles per star is very small , making it difficult to truly establish these correlations .",
    "figure 10 demonstrates that a well - defined phase dependence also exists for the line widths , which are quantified in figure 10 as full - widths - at - half - maxima ( fwhm ) .",
    "the line width behavior is very similar for all the stars , with a decrease from about 70 km  s@xmath1 to 40 km  s@xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the mg  ii h & k lines are by far the brightest lines that appear in the lw - hi spectra of miras , but they are not the only lines present . during pulsation cycles that produce strong mg  ii lines , other lines also appear out of the background noise of the lw - hi spectra .",
    "the largest mg  ii fluxes observed for any star in our sample were observed during the 198990 pulsation cycle of r  car , during which mg  ii h line fluxes reached up to @xmath34 ergs @xmath20 s@xmath1 ( see figs .  4 and 8) .",
    "figure 11 shows three sections of an lw - hi spectrum taken during this period .",
    "these sections contain all of the obvious real emission features apparent in the full spectrum .",
    "the expected line locations of several multiplets are indicated in the figure , which accounts for most of the observed emission features .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by several multiplets of fe  ii lines ( uv1 , uv32 , uv60 , uv62 , and uv63 ) . the mg  ii h & k ( uv1 ) lines are of course apparent , as perhaps are two much weaker mg  ii lines of the uv3 multiplet . the intersystem al  ii ] ( uv1 ) line at 2669.155    is easily visible . @xcite observed the feature at 2823    in an hst / ghrs spectrum of the mira r  hya , and identified it as an fe  i ( uv44 ) 2823.276  line which is fluoresced by the mg  ii k line . a couple other emission features in figure 11",
    "can also be identified with fe  i ( uv44 ) lines .",
    "the lines seen in figure 11 have previously been observed in many iue and hst / ghrs spectra of red giant stars @xcite .",
    "the al  ii ] line and most of the fe  ii lines are formed by collisional excitation , as are the mg  ii h & k lines , but @xcite find that the uv62 and uv63 multiplet lines of fe  ii are excited by a combination of collisional excitation and photoexcitation by photospheric emission at optical wavelengths .",
    "the flux behavior of all the lines in figure 11 parallels that of mg  ii , increasing to a maximum near @xmath35 and then decreasing .",
    "thus , the fe  ii and al  ii ] lines presumably originate in atmospheric locations similar to mg  ii h & k. note that many of the lines apparent in figure 11 were only observed during this one particularly bright cycle of r  car , presumably being too weak to be detected during weaker cycles on r  car and the other stars . for a selection of the brightest emission lines , we used an automated fitting procedure like that described in  3.2.1 to fit gaussians to the lines of all the stars in our sample , whenever the lines are clearly detected .",
    "the lines measured in this manner are listed in table 2 .",
    "for l@xmath12  pup , no observed cycle was bright enough to detect any of these lines , and for s  car only the brightest fe  ii line at 2625.667    could ever be clearly detected .",
    "for the observations in which the lines are observed , we find that line flux ratios among the various fe  ii lines are always similar to those seen in figure 11 , as are mg  ii / fe  ii flux ratios .",
    "for example , the ( mg  ii @xmath362803)/(fe  ii @xmath362626 ) ratio is always about 20 .",
    "the fe  ii and mg  ii / fe  ii flux ratios found for the miras are somewhat different from those observed in red giants , but not radically so .",
    "however , the fe  ii line _",
    "profiles _ are very different . for normal red giant stars ,",
    "most of the fe  ii lines are clearly opacity broadened and have profiles very different from that of a simple gaussian @xcite . in contrast , the fe  ii lines of miras are very narrow , gaussian - shaped emission features , with widths at or near the iue s instrumental resolution of @xmath37  .",
    "this is why we could accurately fit the lines with single gaussians .",
    "the exception is the broader fe  ii 2599.394    line , which should have the highest opacity of all the fe  ii lines .",
    "the widths and velocities of the lines listed in table 2 do not appear to exhibit any substantial phase dependent behavior , in contrast to mg  ii h & k. as an example , in figure 12 we plot the velocities of the fe  ii 2625.667    line as a function of pulsation phase for the four miras in which this line was occasionally detected . only s  car has a hint of phase dependence , with some evidence for a small increase in velocity with phase .",
    "much of the scatter seen in figure 12 could be due to uncertainties in target centering , which can induce systematic velocity errors of @xmath38 km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "since there is little if any phase dependence in the velocities of the lines listed in table 2 , we compute a weighted average and standard deviation for all the measurements of all the lines @xcite , and in table 2 these velocities are listed for each mira in our sample . for r  leo , r  car , and s  car , all of the lines are blueshifted @xmath39 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the fe  ii 2599.394    line is once again an exception , showing significantly larger blueshifts .",
    "the lines of t  cep behave differently , as they do not show systematic blueshifts relative to the star .",
    "the mg  ii lines of t  cep are also not as blueshifted as the other stars ( see  3.2.1 and fig .",
    "it is difficult to identify a reason for this difference in behavior , but perhaps the center - of - mass velocity we are assuming for this star is off by @xmath40 km  s@xmath1 . the difficulties in defining center - of - mass velocities for miras have already been discussed in  2 .",
    "the large blueshifts observed for the mg  ii lines are unlikely to be direct measurements of outflow velocities .",
    "the shock velocities present in miras are expected to be of order @xmath41 km  s@xmath1 , although this issue is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath39 km  s@xmath1 blueshifts seen for most of the fe  ii and al  ii ] lines of r  leo , r  car , and s  car are more likely to be measuring the true outflow velocities of shocked material .",
    "the larger widths and blueshifts of the mg  ii lines are probably due to opacity effects , similar to the findings of @xcite for non - mira m - type giants .",
    "the similar behavior of the fe  ii @xmath362599 line suggests that this line is influenced by similar opacity effects , which is reasonable since this line should have the highest opacity of any of the fe  ii lines .",
    "the other fe  ii lines will have substantially lower optical depths than mg  ii h & k and fe  ii @xmath362599 , and some may even be optically thin .",
    "the al  ii ] @xmath362669 line should also have very low opacity , since it is a semi - forbidden transition .",
    "thus , the fe  ii and al  ii ] line centroids should be more indicative of the true outflow velocities of the shocked material , and the line widths ( which are actually unresolved ) should be more indicative of turbulent velocities within the shocked material .    interpreting the difference between the behavior of the mg  ii lines and that of the less opaque lines could be very important for understanding the structure of the shocks propagating through mira atmospheres . in future work ,",
    "we hope to explore possible reasons why the mg  ii lines are broader and more blueshifted than the less optically thick lines .",
    "we have compiled iue observations of 5 mira variables with substantial iue data sets in order to study the properties of emission lines seen in the uv spectra of these stars , which are believed to be formed behind outwardly propagating shocks in the atmospheres of these pulsating stars .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    ": :    we confirm the phase - dependent mg  ii flux behavior previously reported    for mira variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is observed for all the    pulsation cycles that we study : the mg  ii flux rises after optical    maximum , peaks near @xmath0 , and then decreases .    for some miras ( e.g.  r  car ) the amount of mg  ii flux produced during a    pulsation cycle can vary by 23 orders of magnitude from one cycle to    the next , while for others ( e.g.  s  car ) the flux behavior is more    consistent .",
    "2 . : :    the mg  ii k lines are almost always contaminated with circumstellar    absorption lines of fe  i and mn  i , making analysis of the line profile    very difficult .",
    ":    the mg  ii h line is always blueshifted , with the magnitude of the    blueshift decreasing with pulsation phase .",
    "the blueshifts vary    somewhat from star to star and cycle to cycle , but typical velocity    changes are from @xmath23 km  s@xmath1 to    @xmath25 km  s@xmath1 from @xmath2    to @xmath3 . note , however , that these line shifts do    not represent the actual gas velocities at the formation depths of    these lines , because of the high opacity of mg  ii h & k. these    velocity variations are very similar to those of the optical ca  ii h &    k lines . 4 . : :    the width of the mg  ii h line decreases from about 70    km  s@xmath1 to 40 km  s@xmath1 between    @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "5 . : :    in addition to the mg  ii lines , other lines of fe  ii , fe  i , and al  ii ]    are also observed in iue lw - hi spectra .",
    "the fluxes of these lines show    the same phase - dependent behavior as the mg  ii lines .",
    ": :    unlike mg  ii , these other emission lines tend to be very narrow and do    not show phase - dependent velocity and width variations . except for    fe  ii @xmath362599 ,",
    "the fe  ii and al  ii ] lines of most of    the miras show blueshifts of @xmath39    km  s@xmath1 , which may indicate the flow velocity of the    shocked material .",
    "in contrast , the lines of t  cep do not show any    significant line shifts , although we speculate that perhaps this is    due to an uncertain center - of - mass velocity for this star .",
