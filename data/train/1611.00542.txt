    "as we shall clarify in detail in _ section _ [ consistency ] , the one between these two systems in the ir is not an exact equivalence .",
    "the parallel between the infrared power spectrum of the dm+quintessence duo and that of non - equal time dm fields stems from the fact that a non - trivial time - dependence in @xmath20 acts as an additional  clock \" in the dm - only dynamics . as such",

    "stem from a residual gauge symmetry of the action or the equations of motion ( eom ) of a physical system .",
    "although certain gauges , such as unitary gauge , are known to completely fix diffeomorphism ( diff ) invariance , the fact that such fixing is complete is strictly true only for diffs that vanish at spatial infinity .",
    "indeed , the residual gauge symmetry _ ccs _ rely upon is that of diffs that do not vanish at infinity @xcite . +",
    "one may derive non - trivial _ ccs _ when the soft mode characterizing any squeezed limit transforms non - linearly under the residual diff .",
    "in the context of large scale structure , using the fluid treatment for pure dark matter dynamics , one may show that the system eom posses a time dependent symmetry under which the velocity potential @xmath33 and the newtonian potential @xmath34 transform non - linearly @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it follows that the effect of a long mode @xmath35 on @xmath36 short modes corresponds to the action of a residual gauge - symmetry on the observable made up by the corresponding n - point function and can , as such , be gauged away .",
    "this often translates into a suppressed signal for the squeezed n+1-correlator .",
    "+ the mere requirement that the eom are invariant under a residual diff is not enough to guarantee that the _ ccs _ ( at least in their standard formulation ) , are in place . following e.g. @xcite",

    "it is possible that the residual diff does not generate a relation between just one specific three - point function and the variation of the corresponding two - point correlator .",
    "what happens is that a linear combination of different squeezed three - point functions may correspond to the 2-point function variation .",
    "this makes the content of _ ccs _ somewhat weaker as one may no longer deduce information on one single  squeezed \" observable",

    "this carries important observational consequences which are well known e.g. in the context of multi - field inflationary models where breaking contains information on the mass and the spin of the involved particles @xcite .",
    "let us now apply this line of reasoning to the system in eq .",
    "( [ full ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ fulltransf ] ) it is clear that there are several modes that transform non - linearly under the symmetry : @xmath47 , the last two being the velocity potentials ( @xmath48 ) of @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore the two velocities ( potentials ) have generically independent solutions ( in the above terminology , they can be orthogonalized ) . in the most general setup",
    "the action of a soft mode is then of the form in eq .",
    "( [ less ] ) and does therefore _ break _ standard .",
    "we stress that such a setup in not at all limited to a quintessence component but applies to e.g. general dark energy and modified gravity dynamics , with intriguing exceptions such as galileons @xcite .",
    "we now ask what happens in a reduced system such as that of eq.([packaged ] ) .",
    "the latter can be obtained by imposing on the full system that @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the assumption of a common velocity for all species is here akin to having , loosely speaking , one and a half degrees of freedom . in the constant @xmath28 case , the eom for the total density @xmath52 reduces to eq.([packaged ] ) .",
    "it enjoys the same invariance under eq.([fulltransf ] ) but there is only one velocity potential and its action as a soft mode is not independent from that of the newtonian potential as one may readily verify from the linear eom .",
    "the two act in fact as alternative soft  pions \" @xcite .",
    "what is less evident is whether the adiabaticity condition holds : the soft physical mode and the gauge parameter sharing the same equation of motion .",
    "this may not happen at all or , in particular , it may occur only outside the horizon .",
    "a quick route to the answer is the following .",
    "+ ( 1 ) the adiabaticity condition is known to be satisfied in the pure dark matter case in that the velocity potential equation and gauge parameter eom are the same ; + ( 2 ) the gauge parameter eom does not depend on @xmath28 @xcite ; + ( 3 ) although the velocity eom in eq.([packaged ] ) is formally the same as the dm euler equation in eq .",
    "( [ full ] ) , the resulting solution will not be because the respectively coupled continuity equations will be different as soon as @xmath53 has a non - trivial time dependence in eq.([packaged ] ) .",
    "it follows that the adiabaticity condition is not met and , as seen in _ section _ [ section1 ] , are broken .",
    "let us now provide some more details .",
    "we make explicit below the eom for quintessence and relax the newtonian limit assumption . anticipating that we are going to use the modes in the soft limit , we limit the analysis to the linear eoms .",
    "we first integrate over time and solve for @xmath54 the quintessence density contrast eom ^_q -3 ( w - c_s^2 ) _ q + _ i [ ( 1 + ) v^i]=3^(1+w ) .",
    "[ deltaq ] we then write euler equation for the velocity potential : ^+ ( 1 - 3 w)=-- . [ vel ] recognizing that @xmath55 corresponds to the absence of anisotropic stress , an assumption we make here , one may solve eq .",
    "( [ deltaq ] ) and plug into eq .",
    "( [ vel ] ) to derive an expression for @xmath34 .",
    "the latter is then employed in the @xmath56 component of the perturbed einstein equations ( for the scalar sector ) : -(^ + ) = 4 g a^2 _ ( |_+|p _ ) _ , [ ein ] in particular , the common velocity requirement allows us to factor @xmath57 out of the equation above .",
    "the resulting equation is : & ( ^+2 - b)^ -3 w ( ^ + + ) + & -3c_s^2(- -b)-c_s^2(g^+ g ) + & -3c_s^2 = 0 , [ main ] where @xmath58 is a constant and we have added and subtracted a term proportional to @xmath59 , which is useful in light of the friedman equation ^2-^ = 4 g a^2 _ ( |+|p ) .",
    "the function @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61 and is therefore important only inside the horizon .",
    "let us now analyze eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) in some detail . for @xmath62 one",
    "has : ^+2 - c=0 .",
    "[ pai ] this is precisely the same equation of the gauge parameter @xmath63 in newtonian gauge @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath64 one has : n^i+2 n^i+2b^i=0 , [ enne ] with @xmath65 constant , recovering the well - known result that all three criteria are met in @xmath19cdm and _ ccs _ are active . in the special case @xmath66",
    "we see that the third line in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) vanishes and outside the horizon @xmath33 can satisfy eq .",
    "( [ pai ] ) for any @xmath28 : adiabaticity is satisfied and we reproduce the findings of @xcite .",
    "we stop at this stage to note that in the full system of eq .",
    "( [ full ] ) the @xmath28-proportional term in the euler quintessence equation , as well as the @xmath67 in the second continuity equation , prevent these relations from being fully invariant under eq.([fulltransf ] ) . ) and including all the quadratic terms .",
    "the latter can in fact give also lower order contributions under the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ fulltransf ] ) . ] and yet , we know that for @xmath68 are active outside the horizon .",
    "this has to do with the common velocity requirement . in the newtonian limit it amounts to , subtracting dm and quintessence continuity equations , requiring that 3wv^i . outside the horizon the rhs vanishes and , because of the constraint , so does the lhs .",
    "it follows that , at very large distances and for @xmath69 , the common velocity constraint dynamically enforces the symmetry .",
    "the adiabaticity and initial conditions requirement are also satisfied and so are , in turn , . finally , upon inspecting eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) we see that for @xmath70 but generic @xmath28 it is no longer possible to satisfy eq.([pai ] ) even outside the horizon , thereby concluding that for the reduced system in eq .",
    "( [ packaged ] ) are indeed broken.cdm correlators .",
    "@xmath19cdm dynamics does _ not _ break but the unequal - time correlators have a different behaviour in the squeezed limit w.r.t .",
    "their equal - time counterpart .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that of our reduced system in eq .",
    "( [ packaged ] ) , originating the parallel of _ section _ [ section1 ] . ]",
    "one may ask how the effects of additional dofs propagate all the way to biased tracers observables . just as in @xmath19cdm , here too the effect of short distance physics on long wavelength dynamics is encoded in an effective stress - energy tensor .",
    "there is however also an effective force : it accounts for the momentum exchange ( at short distances ) between dark matter and additional species , mediated by gravity .",
    "one can employ the bias models developed in @xcite to derive the results for two or more species . besides the gravitational field , the density and velocity gradients , as well as the relative velocity of the two species , appear now in      note also",
    "that , in principle , the definition of the  flow \" variable , @xmath72 , accounting for the halo formation , can be different for different species @xcite .",
    "the above equation resembles the dm+baryons result , although there exist one important difference .",
    "the deviation from the eds - like approximation ( i.e. assuming that kernels in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kernels ] ) are time - independent ) introduces new operators in the bias expansion above .",
    "indeed , upon using eq .",
    "( [ bias ] ) , one can show that the time dependence of the kernels in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kernels ] ) , encoded in terms such as @xmath73 , introduces ( after formally performing the time integration ) an independent bias coefficient ( see @xcite ) . at second order in the field",
    "@xmath74 , this is not expected to yield any new independent bias operators due to degeneracies in the operators momentum dependence . for @xmath75 ,",
    "on the other hand , we expect one new independent operator to arise due to the effects of time evolution .",
    "this same reasoning holds already in @xmath19cdm cosmology ( if one does _ not _ assume the eds - like approximation ) but there the effects are known to be small .",
    "crucially , the presence of additional dofs , such as dark energy , will magnify them .",
    "_ conclusions _",
    "+ we have shown how the additional dynamics typical of e.g. beyond-@xmath19cdm models may affect cosmological observables .",
