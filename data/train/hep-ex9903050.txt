    "the atlas collaboration proposes to build a general - purpose pp detector which is designed to exploit the full discovery potential of the cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a super - conducting ring to provide proton ",
    "proton collisions around 14 tev @xcite .",
    "lhc will open up new physics horizons , probing interactions between proton constituents at the 1 tev level , where new behavior is expected to reveal key insights into the underlying mechanisms of nature @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the hadronic calorimetry in the atlas detector is provided by a large ( 11 m in length , 8.5 m in outer diameter , 2 m in thickness , 10000 readout channels ) scintillating tile hadronic barrel calorimeter .",
    "the technology for this calorimeter is based on a sampling technique using steel absorber material and scintillating plates readout by wavelength shifting fibres .",
    "an innovative feature of this design is the orientation of the scintillating tiles which are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams staggered in depth @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ f2 - 28tp ] ) .",
    "this geometry combines good performance and a simple and cost effective assembly procedure @xcite .    in order to test this concept five module prototype of a calorimeter",
    "was built and exposed to high energy pion , electron and muon beams at the cern super proton synchrotron .",
    "results on response , energy resolution and linearity were obtained which confirmed the righteousness of the proposed concept @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to obtain the detailed information about the electron response of this calorimeter and @xmath0 ratios .",
    "this information is based on data which were obtained during test beam period in july 1995 .",
    "some results about the electron response are obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the prototype calorimeter is composed of five sector modules , each spanning @xmath10 in azimuth , 100 cm in the axial ( @xmath2 ) direction , 180 cm in the radial direction ( about 9 interaction lengths ) , and with a front face of 100 @xmath11 20 @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the iron structure of each module consists of 57 repeated `` periods '' .",
    "each period is 18  mm thick and consists of four layers ( fig .",
    "[ f2 - 29tp ] ) .",
    "the first and third layers are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates ( master plates ) , 5 mm thick and spanning the full radial dimension of the module . in the second and fourth layers , smaller trapezoidal steel plates ( spacer plates ) and scintillator tiles alternate along the radial direction .",
    "the spacer plates are 4 mm thick and of 11 different sizes .",
    "scintillator tiles are 3 mm thickness .",
    "the iron to scintillator ratio is 4.67:1 by volume .",
    "radially oriented wls fibres collect light from the tiles at both of their open edges and bring it to photo - multipliers ( pmts ) at the periphery of the calorimeter .",
    "each pmt views a specific group of tiles , through the corresponding bundle of fibres . with this readout scheme three - dimensional segmentation",
    "is immediately obtained .",
    "tiles of 18 different shapes all have the same radial dimensions ( 10 cm ) .",
    "the prototype calorimeter is radially segmented into four depth segments by grouping fibres from different tiles .",
    "proceeding outward in radius , the three smallest tiles , @xmath13 are grouped into section 1 , @xmath14 into section 2 , @xmath15 into section 3 and @xmath16 into section 4 .",
    "the readout cell width in @xmath2 direction is about 20 cm .",
    "the five modules have been positioned on a scanning table , able to allow high precision movements along any direction .",
    "upstream of the calorimeter , a trigger counter telescope was installed , defining a beam spot of 2  cm diameter .",
    "two delay - line wire chambers , each with @xmath2 , @xmath17 readout , allowed to reconstruct the impact point of beam particles on the calorimeter face to better than @xmath18  1  mm @xcite .",
    "a helium erenkov threshold counter was used to tag @xmath19-mesons and electrons for @xmath1 = 20 @xmath7 .",
    "a large scintillator wall covering about 1  @xmath20 of surface has been placed on the side and on the back of the calorimeter to quantify back and side leakage .",
    "data were taken with electron and pion beam of 20 , 50 , 100 , 150 , 300 @xmath7 at @xmath21 and @xmath22 cm .",
    "number of runs about 60 , number of events is approximately a half of million .",
    "the treatment was carried out using program tilemon @xcite .    as a result we have for each event 200 values of charges @xmath23 from pmt properly calibrated @xcite with pedestal subtracted . here",
    "indexes @xmath24 mean : @xmath25 is the raw number , @xmath26 is the module number , @xmath27 is the depth number and @xmath28 is the pmt number .",
    "the table  [ tb1 ] represents the volume of analyzed information . to separate electrons from pions",
    "the following criteria were proposed which are given in table  [ tb2 ] .",
    "the cuts 1 and 2 remove beam halo .",
    "the cut 3 removes muons and nonsingle - track events .",
    "the cuts 4 and 5 carry out electron - pion separation ( fig .  [ fig : f4 ] @xmath29 fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] ) .",
    "the cut 4 is connected with erenkov counter amplitude ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "cut 5 is the relative shower energy deposition in the first two calorimeter depths , where the indexes @xmath31 and @xmath32 in @xmath23 determine the regions of electromagnetic shower development and @xmath33    @xmath34    the values @xmath35 depend on a particle s entry angle @xmath3 .",
    "the basis for electron - hadron separation is the different longitudinal energy deposition for electrons and hadrons .",
    "a particle traversing the first two calorimeter depths at @xmath36 angles crosses @xmath37 cm of iron .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath38 radiation length or @xmath39 nuclear interaction ones .",
    "the amount of energy deposited is equal to approximately 100% for the electromagnetic shower and about half for hadronic one @xcite .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] shows the distribution of electron and pion events as a function of @xmath1 and the value of erenkov counter signal .",
    "two group of events are observed .    figures  [ fig : f5a ] @xmath29 [ fig : f5c ] show the distribution of the electron and pion events for @xmath40 at @xmath41 as a function of @xmath35 for electrons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5a ] ) and for pions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5b ] ) tagged by erenkov counter and for all events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f5c ] ) .",
    "the values @xmath42 for each energy were obtained by gaussian fit of spectra region around 1 where pronounced peaks are observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] ) .    from these figures",
    "some estimations of pion and electron contaminations were obtained . at 20 @xmath7 electron contamination in pion region does not exceed the 3% level and pion contamination in the electron region is less 6%",
    ". these contaminations considerably decrease with energy increasing .",
    "[ fig : f6 ] shows the distribution of all events as a function of @xmath35 for @xmath43  at @xmath44 . at this energy pion contamination in electron region",
    "does not exceed the 1% level .",
    "as to electron response our calorimeter is very complicated object . it may be imagined as a continuous set of calorimeters with the variable absorber and scintillator thicknesses ( from @xmath45 = 81 to 28 mm and from @xmath46 = 17 to 6 mm for @xmath47 ) , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the thicknesses of absorber and scintillator respectively .",
    "therefore an electron response ( @xmath48 ) is rather complicated function of @xmath49 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "energy spectrum for given run ( beam has the transversal spread @xmath50 ) is non - gaussian ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f07 ] ) , but it becomes gaussian for given @xmath8 values .    the normalized electron response for @xmath40 at @xmath51 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] as a function of impact point @xmath2 coordinate .",
    "one can see the clear periodical structure of the response with 18  mm period .",
    "the mean over two 18 mm periods responses @xmath52 and relative spreads ( @xmath53 ) as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath3 are presented in table  [ tb3 ] .",
    "the relative spread decreases with energy increasing from 16% at @xmath54 to 4% at @xmath55 . for @xmath51 the significant relative spread decreasing with energy increasing is observed . for @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "spreads decrease more slowly . in all energies",
    "the spread decreasing with the angle increasing is observed .",
    "the mean value @xmath52 for all angles and energies is @xmath58 . as a systematic error the estimate of r.m.s . of distribution of values",
    "@xmath52 is used . in @xcite",
    "the experimental data on muon response have been converted from @xmath6 to @xmath7 using this calibration constant .",
    "we attempted to explain the electron response as a function of @xmath2 coordinate calculating the total number of shower electrons ( positrons ) crossing scintillator tiles using the shower curve ( the number of particles in the shower @xmath59 as a function of the longitudinal shower development ) which is given in @xcite .",
    "these calculations were performed for all energies and angles for trajectories entering into four different elements of calorimeter periodic structure  spacer , master , tile , master ( fig .",
    "[ f2 - 29tp ] ) .",
    "the results for @xmath40 at @xmath51 normalized and attached to the experimental response at @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f7 ] ) are given in table  [ tb05 ] together with the experimental data .",
    "such simple calculations are in agreement with data at @xmath40 but do not reproduce spread decreasing with energy increasing .",
    "the latter is connect with increasing the shower lateral spread with energy increasing .      for all analyzed electron data the energy resolutions for different values",
    "@xmath8 were obtained .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : f11 ] shows the energy resolution as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath40 at @xmath41 .",
    "data reveal some structures in the @xmath2 dependence but with smaller spread than the response one .",
    "the energy resolutions averaged over two 18 mm @xmath2 period are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f12 ] as a function of @xmath61 and presented in table  [ tb5 ] .",
    "the calculations of energy resolution values were performed without restricting on the area around the peak value .",
    "fits of these data by the formulae @xmath62    @xmath63    are given in table  [ tb6 ] .",
    "these two expressions describe the data satisfactorily .",
    "the values of statistical term @xmath64 about the same for these cases , and the values of constant term @xmath65 about three times is greater in quadratic summing ( [ qs ] ) .",
    "the statistical term @xmath64 of the resolution decreases from @xmath66 65% ( for 10@xmath67 ) to @xmath66 35% ( for 30@xmath67 ) .",
    "the energy resolution of the 10@xmath67 data is significantly worse than for 20@xmath67 and 30@xmath67 ones .",
    "consideration of the 10@xmath67 trajectories traversing the calorimeter showed that in this case on the way of shower the large iron ununirformities exist .",
    "for example , for the trajectory entering in to the master plate the next structure @xmath68 is observed ( thickness of @xmath69 in mm , thickness of scintillator @xmath70 is equal to 17  mm ) . at the same time due to",
    "the relatively short electromagnetic shower length only few scintillator tiles effectively works .",
    "for example , at 20 @xmath7 80% shower particles cross only two tiles . all this result in large energy deposition fluctuations .    from some point of view ,",
    "our calorimeter may be considered as a calorimeter with variable sampling steps ( [ str ] ) . in @xcite",
    "the optimization of electromagnetic calorimeter at variable sampling steps have been studied .",
    "it was shown , that optimization of the sampling layers ( samplers ) positions give significantly better energy resolution with compare to a conventional , constant sampling one . in our case , probably , on the contrary positions of samplers have not lead to the electron energy resolution improvement .",
    "it is to be noted that it concerns only the energy resolution for electrons but for this the calorimeter was not designed .",
    "we compared our results on energy resolution with parametrization from @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 = 0.62 , @xmath74 = 0.21 are the parameters , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the radiation lengths of iron and scintillator respectively . in our case",
    "the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are equal to : @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "this formula is purely empirical and the parameters @xmath79 were determined by fitting monte carlo data .",
    "the results of calculations are given in table  [ tb11 ] .",
    "as can be seen from this table the energy resolutions calculated by formula ( [ dpe ] ) are more accurate than experimental ones but it is necessary to note that there is the non - adequateness of our calorimeter in comparison with monte carlo calculations ( non - uniformity along direction of the shower development , non normal incidence ) .",
    "besides , the given in @xcite values of @xmath79 are not quite adequate for our 10@xmath67 and 20@xmath67 because these parameters were determined for the iron ",
    "scintillator with @xmath80 mm and @xmath81 mm .",
    "the energy spectra for all studied energies and angles were obtained .",
    "as an example , the observed energy spectrum for @xmath82  at @xmath83 is shown in fig .  [ fig : f22 ] .",
    "the spectrum displays small or no tails . above 150 @xmath7",
    "some low energy tail appears due to longitudinal leakage of the hadronic shower .",
    "pion data do nt reveal any structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f21 ] ) with the exception of data at @xmath43 .",
    "this ununiformity was noted previously by m.  bosman @xcite .",
    "this effect may be related with the energy leakage .",
    "the responses obtained for @xmath84 and @xmath19 give the possibility to extract @xmath0 value , the ratio of the calorimeter responses to the electromagnetic ( @xmath84 ) and non - electromagnetic ( purely hadronic ) components of hadron showers . as it is known the value @xmath85 causes deviation from linearity in the hadronic response versus energy , besides broadening the energy resolution @xcite .",
    "the value of the @xmath0 ratio as shown in @xcite depends on a big number of factors , among them , the thickness of the passive layers , the thickness of the active layers , the sampling fraction .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio of a sampling calorimeter with an iron  scintillator ratio less than 20 is expected @xcite to be @xmath86 for the conventional orientation of tiles with respect to incident hadrons .    in our case the electron ",
    "pion ratios reveal complicated structures @xmath87 . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : f13 ] shows @xmath88 ratio as a function of @xmath2 coordinate for @xmath40 at @xmath41 .    for some @xmath2 points the local compensation ( the equalization of the electromagnetic and hadronic signals , @xmath89 ) is observed .",
    "this is the first experimental observation of compensation in iron - scintillator calorimeters .",
    "compensation in these calorimeters had been predicted in @xcite but in considerably greater value of @xmath90 ( much more 10 ) than our @xmath91 value .",
    "reconsideration has led wigmans ( @xcite ) to the conclusion that for thick absorber plates @xmath0 value depends also on the plates thickness and not only on @xmath92 and @xmath0 is predicted to become 1 for plates of @xmath93 mm . in our case the iron thickness is equal to @xmath94 mm .    the @xmath88 ratios averaged over two 18 mm period , are given in table  [ tb7 ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f14 ] as a function of beam energy .",
    "the @xmath0 ratios were extracted from these data by the formula @xcite : @xmath95    fitted @xmath0 values are given in table  [ tb8 ] with the other existing experimental data for iron - scintillator calorimeters together with the corresponding values of thickness of the iron absorber ( @xmath45 ) , thickness of the readout scintillator layers ( @xmath46 ) and the ratio @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f17 ] ) .    the @xmath96 values generally decrease with increasing of iron thickness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f15 ] ) . besides",
    ", some data , @xcite and @xcite , fall out from the general picture .",
    "the result of @xcite may be discarded because in this work as the authors have written the @xmath97 signal ratio is roughly estimated and only at 25 @xmath7 .    at the same time",
    "the considerable disagreement between different monte carlo calculations @xcite , @xcite and experimental data is observed .",
    "accordingly @xcite the reason of @xmath0 decrease is because the hadron signal ( @xmath98 ) increases owing to more neutrons released in hadronic shower with iron thickness increasing while electron signal ( @xmath84 ) decreases owing to more absorption of the electromagnetic shower .",
    "fig.[fig : f16 ] shows the @xmath0 ratios as a function of scintillator thickness .",
    "we observe a decreasing @xmath0 value in comparison with increasing scintillator thickness .",
    "besides , it is seen that the extrapolation of our results and data from @xcite , @xcite by smooth curve is compatible with monte carlo calculations @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : f15 ] and [ fig : f16 ] there is the clear correlation between the @xmath0 decreasing and the simultaneous @xmath45 and @xmath46 thicknesses increasing .",

    "the mean value of electron response for all energies and angles is @xmath101 . *",
    "the energy resolution data are well fitted by formulae ( [ ls ] ) and ( [ qs ] ) . the statistical term @xmath64 of the resolution decreases from @xmath66 65 % ( for 10@xmath67 ) to @xmath66 35 % ( for 30@xmath67 ) .",
