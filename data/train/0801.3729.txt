    "many quasars show short - term or / and long - term variability ( ulrich , maraschi & urry 1997 ) .",
    "these changes in the source flux help to constrain the physics and the size of the central engine .",
    "astronomers came to an early understanding that the central engines of the agns and qsos can not be resolved easily , if at all , but that the variability timescales measure the size of the emitting regions ( i.e. blandford & mckee 1982 ) . later on , this became the basis of reverberation studies ( for a recent review see peterson et al .",
    "2004 and the references therein ) that could map the innermost broad line regions ( hereafter blr ) .",
    "nevertheless , the exact variability mechanisms remain unclear .    typically , the variability is aperiodic , but it does show some dependencies on time lag , luminosity , wavelengths and redshift .",
    "for example , the variability amplitude increases with time lag ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2004 ) , more luminous quasars are less variable ( vanden berk et al . 2004 ; de vries et al . 2005 ; giveon et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the variability increases toward the blue part of the spectrum ( vanden berk et al . 2004 ; de vries et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it is particularly difficult to constrain the variability versus redshift dependence because of the inevitable biases at high redshift , limiting the quasar luminosity range , the probed time - baseline , etc . of the more distant quasars .",
    "the radio properties of qsos also seem to be related to the optical variability : the radio - loud ones are relatively more variable that the radio quiet ones , and the blazars show even stronger variability because of beaming , which is quite different than the long - term variability studied in this work . for a more comprehensive review of the qso variability properties we refer the reader to the summary of wold , brotherton & shang ( 2007 ) . as of now",
    ", there is no commonly accepted theory of the qso variability and the existence of some strange objects , albeit rare ones , complicates the picture even further .",
    "a good example is the radio - quiet qso sdssj153259.96 - 003944.1 ( stalin & srianand 2005 ) who is the prototype of the rare class of weak ( or absent ) emission - line quasars ( wlqs ) .",
    "this object shows strong long - term variability and flat optical spectrum like bllacs but there is no radio emission , no optical polarization and no x - ray ( shemmer et al .",
    "these properties may be explained by a deficit of line - emitting gas in the vicinity of the central continuum source , similar to the x - ray weak quasar phl1811 ( leighly et al .",
    "2007 and the references therein ) .",
    "the most comprehensive quasar variability studies , especially the ones covering long time scales , are focused either on bright low - redshift ones ( hook et al . 1994 ; hawkins 2002 ) , or they study the behavior of the structure function for large samples ( de vries , becker & white 2003 ; de vries et al . 2005 ; hovatta et al .",
    "the literature is lacking well sampled light curves of individual distant quasars , with the notable exception of kaspi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with whom we share five objects from our extended program .",
    "while challenging , the distant qsos are also rewarding because the variability can help constrain the size of the qso accretion disks ( hawkins 2007 ) at early times .",
    "furthermore , identifying variable high - redshift quasars is a necessary first step for reverberation mapping of their broad line regions ( i.e. kaspi et al .",
    "these arguments motivated us to start an optical monitoring study of qsos with @xmath1@xmath54 .    here",
    "we present a photometric sequence for q2203 + 292 , which is one of the first detected quasars within that redshift range ( dickinson & mccarthy 1987 ) and it is radio - quiet ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 ; schmidt et al . 1995 ; omont et al .",
    "surdej et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , crampton , mcclure & fletcher ( 1992 ) and kochanek ( 1993 ) reported that it is not gravitationally lensed .",
    "the only study in the literature on the q2203 + 292 variability comes from mccarthy et al .",
    "( 1988 ) who concluded from three lick 3 m plates and two plates from the 5 m hale telescope ( longair & gunn 1975 ; riley , longair & gunn 1980 ) that the quasar did not vary strongly over a period of the 15 years since its discovery .",
    "a few additional broadband observations of q2203 + 292 are reported elsewhere , but they are in different photometric systems ( see table  [ table_literature ] ) .",
    "turner ( 1991 ) calculated for q2203 + 292 a mass of the central black hole of ( 0.69 - 9.6)@xmath610@xmath7 m@xmath3 and a mass accretion rate of 1.6 - 22 m@xmath3/yr , depending on the adopted cosmological model .",
    "this values are typical for the quasars at the same redshift ( turner 1991 ; dietrich & hamann 2004 ) .",
    ".broad band photometry of q2203 + 292 since 1987 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the quasar shows ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) a brightness increase of @xmath20.75 mag at the beginning of the coverage but it is nearly constant later . due to the gaps in the lightcurve , any non - linear fluctuations ( such as flares ) can not be ruled out .",
    "we verify the variability properties of the q2203 + 292 by means of differential photometry and monte carlo simulation .",
    "the differential light curves ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) of the quasar were generated with respect to the reference stars a and b , two of the most stable stars near the quasar .",
    "the rms of the relative light curve a  b is 0.035 mag , and since the two stars have similar magnitudes , their individual errors are @xmath20.025 mag .",
    "the rms for the quasar light curve with respect to star a ( marked as q  a ) is 0.083 and with respect to star b ( marked as q  a ) is 0.086 mag .",
    "the maximum peak - to - peak variation of the quasar is @xmath20.92 mag over the entire monitoring period ( table .",
    "[ table_uniflightcurge ] ) but it is reduced to 0.21 mag if we consider only the rozhen observations .",
    "the rms of all 18 qso measurements is 0.20 mag , and if only our 14 measurements are considered , it decreases to 0.08 mag .    to test further the variability of q2203 + 292",
    ", we carried out a monte carlo simulation drawing 18 measurements from a constant source with the measured mean magnitude of q2203 + 292 .",
    "each of these points was generated from a gaussian distribution with the observational error of the corresponding measurement , so that the artificial datasets more faithfully represent the properties of the real observations .",
    "if we consider all data , including the ones from the literature , none of one million simulated data sets exceeded the observed rms however , the colour transformations can be a source of extra uncertainty , so we carried the same simulation only for our 14 measurements to obtained that in 98.5 per cent of the cases the data are inconsistent with a constant source . excluding the vlt point lowers this probability down to 86.4 per cent .",
    "we conclude that if the colour transformation of the historical observations can be considered reliable , the quasar have undergone a brightening episode in the past but the unaccounted systematic effects stop is from making a strong statement about this .",
    "all the literature data consistently deviate from ours in one direction , albeit by different amount , hinting that the variation may be real .",
    "next , our own data show that during the recent years the quasar is in relatively stable state .    the @xmath8 band in the rest - frame of the quasar correspond to the uv flux between 970 and 1420  , including the ly@xmath4 emission line .",
    "to compare the variability properties of q2203 + 292 with those of lower redshift quasars , we calculated the structure function s(@xmath9 ) , which is commonly used to characterize the variability of large quasar samples ( i.e. hughes , aller & aller 1992 ) : @xmath10 ^ 2 \\rangle.\\ ] ] here , @xmath11 is the magnitude at time @xmath12 and @xmath9 is the time interval between the two measurements in the qso rest frame .",
    "the broken brackets express ensemble average over measurements with the same time interval .",
    "the structure function is less sensitive to the inhomogeneity of the observational coverage , and it can be applied to both individual objects and to samples of objects .",
    "note that sometimes in the literature the structure function is defined as a square root of the ensemble average .",
    "the structure function for q2203 + 292 is shown in fig .",
    "the small number of measurements that form each bin lead to large uncertainties making it difficult to draw definite conclusions . the overall shape of s(@xmath9 ) for q2203 + 292 is similar to that of other qsos studied in the literature ( i.e. vanden berk et al .",
    "it is dominated by observational errors for short time intervals and by the intrinsic qso variability for the longer ones .",
    "there is indication that s(@xmath9 ) may reach a plateau at time scale just above 1 yr .",
    "however , quasars are known to vary on a much longer time - scale , so we interpret this as poor sampling .",
    "note that the structure functions of some qsos may show intrinsic structure in s(@xmath9 ) that is often interpreted as variability driven by more than one physical mechanism ( see hughes et al .",
    "1992 for examples ) .",
    "we can not exclude that this can be the case with q2203 + 292 .",
    "further observations over longer time span are necessary to address this question .    a quick comparisons with the literature , typically for @xmath9@xmath20.5 - 2 yr , shows that q2203 + 292 is relatively more variable than the average qso in the samples of cristiani et al .",

    "the absolute @xmath0-band magnitude , @xmath20 , is related to the apparent magnitude , @xmath0 , by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is galactic absorption , and @xmath23 is the luminosity distance for a flat universe .",
    "the k - correction @xmath24 is calculated by convolving a quasar spectrum with a sensitivity curve for a standard @xmath25 filter ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we used our composite spectrum ( see sec .",

    "( 2002 ) for our target . in the latter case @xmath27=0.25 mag , 0.06 mag smaller than the value derived for @xmath1=4.40 from the composite spectrum .",
    "although this is a systematic rather than random error , we added this difference in quadrature to the @xmath20 uncertainty ( equal to the rms of all q2203 + 292 measurements ) to obtain a conservative error estimate . assuming @xmath22=0.25 mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) and using the average @xmath8=20.46 mag we obtained @xmath20=@xmath2829.39 mag , typical for the sdss quasar distribution at that redshift ( fig .",
