    "the production of electroweak vector boson in association with jets forms one of the most studied class of standard model ( sm ) processes .",
    "w + jets is a background to single and pair top production , and both w and z in association with jets constitute significant backgrounds to processes with dibosons , higgs production as well as to searches for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "v+jets processes are also interesting in their own right , as they provide important tests of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .    both w+jets and",
    "z+jets production has been recently studied experimentally at the lhc , @xmath1 , by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations .",
    "there exist a range of theoretical frameworks and tools that allow one to make predictions of cross sections and distributions for the w / z+jets processes .",
    "many of them have been used in the context of the lhc .",
    "results at fixed next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) in qcd for w / z in association with up to 2 jets are available from mcfm  @xcite , up to 3 jets from rocket  @xcite , and up to 4 jets ( 5 in the case of w ) from blackhat  @xcite+sherpa  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been used as well to study nlo samples merged with the exclusive sums method  @xcite .",
    "v+jets production at the lhc has been also studied with the traditional lo monte carlo ( mc ) programs including the parton shower ( ps ) and hadronization stages , pythia  @xcite , herwig  @xcite , sherpa  @xcite , alpgen  @xcite , the latter allowing for merging of lo samples with different multiplicities .",
    "the hej formalism  @xcite , based on high - energy resummation , has been also used to study the production of a w boson associated with jets  @xcite .",
    "finally , recent years have seen an enormous progress in the field of nlo + ps matching and nlo merging , with a range of new techniques being used to study v+jets production .",
    "those started with mc@nlo  @xcite and powheg  @xcite and were further developed and refined into new methods : meps@nlo  @xcite , minlo  @xcite , fxfx  @xcite , unlops  @xcite and a similar unitarity - preserving approach by platzer  @xcite .",
    "the two last methods are both related to loopsim  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a study of w / z+jets processes at approximate next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in qcd , in the context of the lhc , @xmath1 .",
    "our nnlo results include exact double - real and real - virtual contributions as well as exact singular terms of the 2-loop diagrams .",
    "the motivation to go beyond nlo comes from the fact that the next - to - leading order corrections for these processes turn out to be sizable for a number of important distributions at high transverse momentum .",
    "these corrections come about due to new production channels and new topologies absent at lo and appearing for the first time at nlo . for example , at leading order , the production of a vector boson in association with a jet is possible only via @xmath2 or @xmath3 channels . at nlo ,",
    "the new @xmath4 channel , with enhanced partonic luminosity , opens up and adds a substantial contribution to the cross section .",
    "similarly , at lo , only back - to - back v+jet configurations are possible .",
    "henceforth , we shall call them the `` lo - type topologies '' . at nlo",
    ", however , a totally different type of topology appears , with two hard qcd partons recoiling against each other and the electroweak boson , emitted from a quark line , being soft or collinear .",
    "the latter brings logarithmic enhancements for a number of distributions . in the following",
    ", we shall call such configurations `` dijet - type topologies '' .    because the nlo corrections often turn out to be commensurate with the leading order , it is of great importance to try to assess the nnlo contributions , to check the convergence of the perturbative series , and to obtain precise and stable results . while the exact @xmath5 results for the inclusive w / z+jet production are still missing , we can compute the dominant part of the nnlo corrections to these processes at high @xmath0 , using the loopsim procedure to merge nlo samples with different multiplicities .",
    "the loopsim method was proposed in  @xcite and validated there in the studies of z+jets , drell - yan and dijets .",
    "it has been also shown to successfully describe the tevatron data  @xcite and used for predictions of the wz production  @xcite . here",
    "we use it in the context of the experimental studies of z+jets and w+jets production at the lhc , @xmath1  @xcite , following the atlas cuts , and confronting our results with available data .",
    "the method is briefly summarized in the following section . in order to distinguish our predictions with simulated loops from those with exact loop diagrams , we denote the approximate loops by @xmath6 , as opposed to n used for the exact ones .",
    "so , for example , @xmath7 means the correction with simulated 1-loop diagrams , but @xmath8 is a result with exact 1-loop and simulated 2-loop contributions .",
    "similarly , @xmath9 corresponds to the result with simulated 1-loop and simulated 2-loop diagrams and @xmath10 would have exact 1-loop and simulated 2 and 3-loop contributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide a short description of the loopsim method and give details of our calculation . in section  [ sec : vjetsresults ] , we present the results for w+jets ( sec .",
    "[ sec : wjets ] ) and z+jets ( sec . [",
    "sec : zjets ] ) at @xmath11 .",
    "we show distributions for a range of important observables and , where possible , we confront our predictions with the experimental data . in section",
    "[ sec : ratios ] , we discuss the ratios of differential distributions for either w+jets and z+jets or w@xmath12+jets and w@xmath13+jets , and comment on their potential advantages . finally , we summarise our study in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "for the calculation of w / z+jets at @xmath11 , we used loopsim together with mcfm  @xcite and independently with blackhat+sherpa  ntuples .",
    "the loopsim method  @xcite allows for merging of the nlo samples with different multiplicities to obtain approximate nnlo results . in the case of the v+jets process ,",
    "the computation proceeds as follows : the nlo program provides v+1j and v+2j weighted events .",
    "loopsim takes these events and starts by assigning a diagram to each of them .",
    "this is done by clustering the event with the cambridge / aachen  ( c / a ) jet algorithm  @xcite , as implemented in fastjet  @xcite , with a certain radius @xmath14 .",
    "the c / a algorithm sequentially clusters pairs of particles closest in angle , that is with the smallest @xmath15 measure , where @xmath16 is a distance between particles @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the rapidity - azimuthal angle plane .",
    "the indices @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the number of particles in the event .",
    "the algorithm stops when @xmath21 and all the remaining particles are clustered with the beam .",
    "then , each merging of partons @xmath22 , done by the c / a algorithm , is reinterpreted as splitting @xmath23 in the corresponding feynman diagram .",
    "this interpretation is valid in the soft and collinear limit , where loopsim serves its main function of cancelling divergences .    in the next step , the underlying hard structure of the event",
    "is determined by working through the @xmath24 recombinations in order of decreasing hardness , defined by the @xmath25 algorithm  @xcite measure : @xmath26 for @xmath24 merging and @xmath27 for beam recombination .",
    "the first @xmath28 particles associated with the hardest merging are marked as `` born '' . in the case of v+jets , there are always two of them , either a boson and a parton or two partons .",
    "the remaining non - born particles are then `` looped '' by finding all possible ways of recombining them with the emitters . in this step",
    ", loopsim generates an approximate set of 1 and 2-loop diagrams with the weights equal to @xmath29 . in the last step , a double counting , between the approximate 1-loop events generated by loopsim and the exact 1-loop events coming from the nlo sample with lower multiplicity ,",
    "is removed .",
    "this is done essentially by generating 1-loop diagrams from the tree level events first , and then using them to generate all possible 1 and 2-loop events .",
    "this set is subtracted from the result of applying loopsim to pure tree level diagrams , which has 0 , 1 and 2 approximate loops . for more details , see  @xcite .",

    ", we shall use @xmath33 , and we shall vary it by @xmath34 . the @xmath14 uncertainty will therefore account for the part of the loopsim method which is related to attributing the emission sequence and the underlying hard structure of the events .    the loopsim method determines exactly the singular ( or logarithmic ) terms of the loop diagrams , which , by construction , match precisely the corresponding singular terms of the real diagrams with one extra parton .",
    "therefore , the @xmath11result is finite and it differs from the exact nnlo only by the constant terms .",
    "for an observable ( a ) that receives significant nlo corrections due to new channels or new topologies , the difference between @xmath11and nnlo , which is inversely proportional to the k - factor , will be very small @xmath35 where @xmath36 .    in order to make the w / z+jets@@xmath11computation possible , we extended mcfm  by adding a reweighting option to allow for efficient generation of tails of distributions and an option to obtain only the virtual part of the nlo result .",
    "in addition , we added a module that allows to write events in the les houches event ( lhe ) format  @xcite .",
    "then , we developed an interface between mcfm  and loopsim which uses the lhe for communication between the two programs .",
    "these extra features of mcfm  will become part of its new release  6.7 . in order to use the results from blackhat+sherpa",
    ", we replaced the lhe output interface to loopsim with one that accesses the weighted events stored in the form of root  ntuples using the ntuplereader library  @xcite .",
    "the results for w+jets and z+jets production at @xmath11were obtained both with loopsim+mcfm  and with loopsim+root  ntuples . although the loopsim method allows in principle to use event samples with arbitrarily low jet transverse momentum , we need to impose a cut on this quantity for efficiency reasons .",
    "this technical cut - off on the @xmath0 of jets was set to 1  @xmath31for mcfm  but only 20  @xmath31for the ntuples . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcfm - vs - ntuples ] we show the effect of this different choice on several distributions .",

    "gev the two approaches give consistent results at @xmath11 .",
    "since its technical cut - off is lower , we shall only show predictions from loopsim interfaced with mcfm  in the following section .",
    "the independence on the technical cut - off of the prediction at high transverse momenta is encouraging for the prospect of extending this study to include higher jet multiplicity samples that are available through blackhat+sherpa  ntuples .",
    "we have verified that all @xmath11histograms for the observables shown in this study coincide for the mcfm  and blackhat+sherpa  ntuples except in immediate proximity of the generation cut .",

    "they are also motivated experimentally since they should be almost free of uncertainties coming from luminosity measurement , jet energy scale or unfolding .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] ( left ) we show the w+jets / z+jets ratios as functions of the @xmath0 of the electroweak boson , @xmath0 of the leading jet and @xmath52 .",
    "the bands correspond to varying the renormalization and factorization scale by factors 1/2 and 2 , simultaneously for the numerator and the denominator , hence they indicate scale dependence of the ratios .",
    "we see that the results are flat , regardless of the order , except for the range below 200 gev , where the difference between the masses of w and z is still non - negligible compared to their transverse momenta .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the production of w+jets at high @xmath0 at lo occurs predominantly via @xmath80 and @xmath81 , for w@xmath12 and w@xmath13 , respectively , whereas for z+jets it involves both @xmath80 and @xmath81 channels in approximately equal proportions .",

    "similar mechanism is at work for the subdominant @xmath2 channel where w@xmath12+jets is produced via @xmath83 and w@xmath13+jets via @xmath84 , whereas z+jets production involves the @xmath85 and @xmath86 channels .",

    "[ fig : ratios ] ( left ) , above 200 gev , is an overall effect of different decay channels of the w and z bosons and different cuts used for the two processes .",

    "[ fig : wjets - allobs1 ] and [ fig : zjets - allobs1 ] ) , which , through different cuts on the w and z bosons decay products , lead to an increase of the ratios .    finally , the @xmath11results from fig .",

    "[ fig : ratios ] ( right ) shows the w@xmath12+jets / w@xmath13+jets ratios and the observations made above largely apply also here .",
    "in particular , the nlo and @xmath11corrections are small and the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scale is significantly lower than for each distribution separately .",
    "the w@xmath12+jets / w@xmath13+jets ratios , however , are not flat because they involve the @xmath92 pdf ratio , which is an increasing function of  @xmath82 and large @xmath82 values correspond to the tails of the distributions .",
    "this observation is consistent with findings from  @xcite .    altogether",
    ", the low sensitivity to higher order qcd corrections and weak dependence on the factorization and renormalization scales make the ratios from fig .",

    "we presented the study of w+jets and z+jets production at the approximate next - to - next - to leading order in qcd .",
    "we focused on the center of mass energy @xmath1 and we adopted the fiducial volumes of  @xcite , which allowed for a direct comparison of our results to the available atlas data .",
    "we used the loopsim method to merge nlo samples of different multiplicity obtained from mcfm  and from blackhat+sherpa  in order to compute the dominant part of the nnlo corrections for jet observables at high @xmath0 .",
    "our predictions , referred to as @xmath11 , are expected to be accurate in the regions of phase space dominated by new channels and new topologies appearing at nlo .",
    "this corresponds to the large @xmath0/@xmath37 regions of distributions .",
    "we found that , for both processes , the leading jet @xmath0 distribution comes under control at @xmath11 , with the scale uncertainty being reduced by up to 70% and the result staying within the nlo band . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath37-type observables still receive significant corrections at @xmath11 , of the order of 50% with respect to nlo .",
    "we also checked that , as expected , for the distributions of the @xmath0 of the electroweak bosons , leptons and missing @xmath93 , which do not exhibit a large k - factor at nlo , the @xmath11result does not bring any significant correction .    for both w+jets and z+jets processes",
    ", we compared our @xmath11results to the experimental data from atlas . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the agreement between data and theory is comparable to that at nlo .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath11result exhibits , however , much smaller theoretical uncertainty . nevertheless , the statistical errors of the data are still too large at high @xmath0 to favour one prediction of over the other . on the other side , the @xmath52 and @xmath51 distributions at @xmath11agree much better with the data than nlo . as discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : wjets ] , this is due to the fact that the @xmath11result includes v+2j configurations at nlo and v+3j configurations at lo , which represent a sizable contribution at high @xmath37 .",
