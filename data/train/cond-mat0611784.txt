    ", the progress in growth , characterization and understanding of transition - metal - doped semiconductors has been impressive @xcite . as a result ,",
    "new phenomena have been discovered , e.g. tunnel magnetoresistance , spin - dependent scattering , interlayer coupling due to carrier polarization , electrical electron and hole spin injection , and electric field control of ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "usually the host material is a iii - v semiconductor @xcite .",
    "for example , in ( ga , mn)as or in ( in , mn)as , mn substitutes a small fraction of cations providing holes and local magnetic moments . hence , the corresponding structures utilize the valence band .",
    "the highest ferromagnetic transition temperature , @xmath11 , reported so far for iii - v - based valence - band magnetic semiconductors is 173 k in ( ga , mn)as epilayers @xcite .    in ii - vi materials , mn provides only local magnetic moments .",
    "the corresponding heterostructures , for example znse / zn@xmath12cd@xmath13mn@xmath14se , utilize either the conduction or the valence band , depending on the type of dopants used in the barriers , namely , donors ( e.g. cl , i ) or acceptors ( e.g. li ) , respectively . in the present article",
    "we investigate such a system where either the conduction band or the valence band can be exploited for spintronic applications .",

    "interestingly the existence of ferromagnetic order in n - doped ( cd , mn)te based structures -at extremely low temperatures- has been suggested both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .    in a recent publication",

    "electron spin - splitting @xmath2 can be considered as the sum of two terms , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath17 is proportional to the cyclotron gap , @xmath19 , while @xmath18 arises from the exchange interaction between the itinerant carrier ( conduction electron in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the localized spins ( mn@xmath20 cations in ref .",
    "notice that in such an approximation the _ direct _ exchange interaction between the neighboring localized impurity spins is neglected , being much smaller than the interaction between impurity spins and carrier spins @xcite , although according to a recent report it might influence the carrier spin polarization @xcite .",
    "the very low @xmath0 impelled us to a drastic first approximation @xcite , i.e. to take into account only @xmath18 , and moreover to approximate the corresponding brillouin function by 1 .    in the present article we attempt a major improvement .",
    "namely , we examine the relative influence of @xmath17 and @xmath18 in a wide temperature band ( 0 to 400 k ) and in a wide in - plane magnetic field band ( 0 to 20 t ) , as well as in a wide range of material parameters , not necessarily restricting ourselves in the conduction band @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to systematically study the influence of the dos modification on the spin - subband populations and the spin - polarization of quasi two - dimensional carriers , as functions of the in - plane magnetic field and the temperature . besides , we indicate the ranges where the system is completely spin - polarized . in section [ sec : theory ] we introduce our theoretical framework . in section",

    "we notice that in the present system due to the influence of carriers , increase of the qw width transforms the heterostructure from an `` almost perfect square qw '' to a `` double qw with a soft barrier '' ( `` a system of two separated heterojunctions '' ) @xcite .",

    "this @xmath6 dependence is quite often `` conveniently '' ignored , although this is only justified for narrow qws . however , with the existing computing power , such a `` simplification '' is not any more necessary . only in the limit @xmath10 , the dos retains the _ occasionally stereotypic _ staircase shape with the _ ideal _ step @xmath35 for each spin . the opposite asymptotic limit of eq .",

    "the kinetic exchange contribution which -in principle- can induce spontaneous spin - polarization i.e. in the absence of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath56 is positive for conduction band electrons .",
    "finally , for conduction band electrons , the spin polarization can be defined by    @xmath57    @xmath58 is the free carrier two - dimensional ( sheet ) concentration .",
    "the use of such a simplified brillouin - function approach is quite common when dealing with quasi two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "this way , the spin - orbit coupling is not taken into account .",
    "this is certainly a simplification , since increasing temperature , the magnetization of the magnetic ions competes with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling @xcite induces temperature dependent spin relaxation .",
    "therefore , the carriers spin - polarization does not only depend on the magnetic order of the magnetic ions , expressed here with the help of the brillouin function and the carriers spin relaxation influences the magnetic order of the localized magnetic moments .",
    "the variation of the temperature , @xmath0 , affects the spin polarization .",
    "the spin polarization is also influenced by the magnetic field , in an opposite manner i.e. @xmath1 tends to align the spins .",
    "furthermore , for each type of spin population , the in - plane magnetic field -via the distortion of the dos- redistributes the electrons between the subbands .",
    "consequently , the spin polarization can be tuned by varying the temperature and the magnetic field .",
    "indeed , preliminary conduction band calculations for specific values of the material parameters , for very narrow quantum wells , have shown @xcite that when the `` feedback mechanism '' due to the difference between the populations of the spin down and the spin up electrons can be neglected , the spin polarization vanishes for @xmath10 .",
