    "fesb@xmath2 is a narrow - gap semiconductor which attracted a lot of attention because of its unusual magnetic,@xcite thermoelectric@xcite and transport properties.@xcite the magnetic susceptibility of fesb@xmath2 is nearly constant at low temperatures with paramagnetic to diamagnetic crossover at around 100 k for a field applied along the @xmath8-axis , similar to fesi.@xcite the electrical resistivity along the @xmath9- and @xmath10 - axes shows semiconducting behavior with rapid increase for t @xmath11 100 k. along the @xmath8 -axis resistivity exhibits a metal to semiconductor transition at around 40 k.@xcite based on the measurements of the electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , thermal expansion , heat capacity and optical conductivity the fesb@xmath2 has been characterized as a strongly correlated semiconductor.@xcite it was also shown that fesb@xmath2 has colossal seebeck coefficient @xmath12 at 10 k and the largest power factor @xmath13 ever reported.@xcite thermal conductivity @xmath14 of fesb@xmath2 is relatively high and is dominated by phonons around 10 k with phonon mean free path @xmath15 m several orders of magnitude larger than electronic mean free path.@xcite    in the recent room temperature study we have observed , for the first time , all six raman active modes of fesb@xmath2 predicted by theory.@xcite racu _",

    "the coupling between single phonon and the electronic background is drastically reduced for temperatures bellow 40 k , fully in agreement with transport properties measurements.@xcite alloying of fesb@xmath2 with co and cr also reduces the coupling , i.e. leads to the b@xmath6 mode narrowing .",

    "we have found that laser power level of 0.02 mw on the sample is sufficient to obtain raman signal and , except signal to noise ratio , no changes of the spectra were observed as a consequence of laser heating by further lowering laser power . the corresponding excitation power density was less then 0.1 kw/@xmath22 .",
