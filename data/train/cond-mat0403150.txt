    "the determination of the effective interaction between two surfaces of a film - like structure is essential for the understanding of the conformational stability of a whole range of systems in soft - condensed matter physics .",
    "examples are found in interactions between membranes and colloid physics @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction between two semi - infinite dielectrics separated by a vacuum was calculated by lifshitz @xcite and the effect of an intervening dielectric was determined by dzyaloshinski , lifshitz and pitaevskii @xcite and subsequently reformulated more simply in @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction is due to van der waals or dispersion forces and is given by the sum over the matsubara modes of the problem ; the non - zero frequency modes are a quantum effect and the contribution of zero modes corresponds to a thermal casimir type effect . in purely dielectric problems",
    "the contribution of each mode is described by a free gaussian field theory and it has been shown how the input to these free field theories can be determined using dielectric data , see @xcite and references therein .    in many situations , especially in biology , the middle slab of the system is filled with an electrolyte .",
    "for example , this is the case for a simple soap film connected to a bulk which is filled with an aqueous salt solution .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the presence of an electrolyte will not effect the non - zero frequency contribution to the interaction basically because the response time of the ions is too large to couple them to the these non - zero frequency modes .",
    "however the zero - frequency , or static , component of the interaction does couple to the ionic distribution and consequently its contribution is strongly affected by the presence of electrolyte .",
    "the field theory describing the zero frequency fluctuations of the electric field in the presence of ions is no longer a free field theory ; the interactions are made up of two components : the basic thermal fluctuations of the electrostatic field and the induced coulombic interactions between the ions . in the presence of a neutral surface and a symmetric monovalent electrolyte the mean - field electrostatic potential is zero and the one - loop contribution about this trivial mean - field solution is equivalent to debye - hckel theory .",
    "the one - loop result is described and computed in @xcite and has been rederived using a variety of different methods , for instance see @xcite . in the absence of electrolyte",
    "the zero frequency contribution to the effective interaction , commonly known as the disjoining pressure @xmath4 , behaves as @xmath5 for a film of thickness @xmath6 . in the presence of electrolyte , at large film separations relative to the debye length @xmath1",
    ", the disjoining pressure is screened at one loop and has the form @xmath7 . in both of these cases",
    "the constant @xmath8 is positive and hence the effective force between the surfaces is attractive at one - loop order .    in this paper",
    "we calculate @xmath4 to two - loop order .",
    "the naive two - loop calculation is in fact divergent when the dielectric constant of the film , or slab , is greater than that of the exterior @xcite , but we show here that the result can be resummed using a cumulant expansion similar to that used in @xcite for the bulk to give a finite result which we argue is to be expected on physical grounds .",
    "the expansion we use can be controlled systematically , and the perturbative parameter is @xmath9 where @xmath2 is the bjerrum length . while the one - loop or first term in the expansion in @xmath10 is regular , the second order term in @xmath10 is of the form @xmath11 , this singular behavior is found in the onsager - samaras limiting law for the excess surface tension of electrolyte solutions and has its origin in the image forces which repel the ions from the air / water interface .",
    "we also analyse the behavior of the @xmath12 term for large film thickness @xmath6 and find that this term has the behavior @xmath13 , which means that it becomes larger than the one - loop result for very thick films .",
    "we conjecture that this result suggests that it is the first term in a series which sums to give a contribution at large @xmath6 to the disjoining pressure with behaviour @xmath14 , where the exponent @xmath15 has the form @xmath16 .",
    "the model of the soap film we shall consider is the following .",
    "the film body is a planar slab of thickness @xmath6 surrounded on both sides by an external dielectric medium such as air .",
    "the interior of the film is filled with electrolyte and connected to a bulk reservoir of electrolyte .",
    "the electrolyte consists of a passive solvent of uniform dielectric constant containing monovalent anions and cations which are treated as point charges of charges @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the electrolyte is symmetric in the sense that the anions and cations are identical in every respect other than that they have opposite electric charges .    in what follows",
    "we shall use the standard field theoretic formulation for symmetric monovalent electrolyte systems @xcite . the grand partition function for a film of electrolyte solution , surrounded on both sides by an external medium such as air , of thickness @xmath6",
