    "the main purpose of this article is to introduce a new notion of generalized symplectic handles , which can be attached to contact @xmath0-manifolds along certain transverse links and pre - lagrangian tori .",
    "we begin by stating in  [ sec : results ] the essential definitions and explaining some existence results for non - exact symplectic cobordisms that follow from the handle construction . as easy applications ,",
    "these results imply new and substantially simplified proofs of several recent results of the author and collaborators on obstructions to symplectic fillings , contact type embeddings and embeddings of partially planar domains .",
    "the main results concerning the handle construction itself will be explained in  [ sec : handles ] , together with a simple application to embedded contact homology and a conjectured generalization . in   [ sec : consequences ] we discuss further applications and examples , providing a unified framework for reproving several important previous results of eliashberg , gay , etnyre and others involving the existence of symplectic cobordisms . the hard work is then undertaken in ",
    "[ sec : details ] , of which the first several sections construct the symplectic handles described in  [ sec : handles ] ,  [ sec : proofs ] completes the proofs of the results stated in the introduction , and  [ sec : holomorphic ] discusses the construction of a holomorphic foliation in the cobordisms , which we expect should have interesting applications in embedded contact homology and/or symplectic field theory .",
    "the writing of this article benefited substantially from discussions with john etnyre , david gay , paolo ghiggini , michael hutchings , klaus niederkrger , andrs stipsicz , cliff taubes and jeremy van horn - morris .",

    "symplectic and contact topology and dynamics : puzzles and horizons_.      in topology , an oriented cobordism from one closed oriented manifold  @xmath4 to another  @xmath5 is a compact oriented manifold  @xmath6 such that @xmath7 . if  @xmath6 has dimension  @xmath8 and also carries a symplectic structure  @xmath9 , then it is natural to consider the case where @xmath10 is * symplectically convex * at  @xmath5 and * concave * at  @xmath4 : this means there exists a vector field @xmath11 near  @xmath12 which points transversely outward at  @xmath5 and inward at  @xmath4 , and is a * liouville * vector field , i.e.  @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the @xmath14-form @xmath15 is a primitive of  @xmath9 and its restriction to each boundary component  @xmath16 is a ( positive ) * contact form * , meaning it satisfies @xmath17 .",
    "the induced * contact structure * on  @xmath16 is the ( co - oriented ) hyperplane field @xmath18 , and up to isotopy it depends only on the symplectic structure near the boundary .",
    "we thus call @xmath10 a * ( strong ) symplectic cobordism * from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "when such a cobordism exists , we say that @xmath19 is * symplectically cobordant * to @xmath20 and write @xmath21 if @xmath22 also extends to a global primitive of @xmath9 , or equivalently , @xmath11 extends to a global liouville field on  @xmath6 , then we call @xmath10 an * exact symplectic cobordism * from @xmath19 to @xmath20 and write @xmath23 when @xmath24 , it is also interesting to consider a much weaker notion : without assuming that @xmath9 is exact near @xmath12 , we call @xmath10 a * weak symplectic cobordism * from @xmath19 to @xmath20 if @xmath25 are any two positive co - oriented ( and hence also oriented ) contact structures such that @xmath26 .",
    "we then say that @xmath9 * dominates * the contact structures on both boundary components .",
    "it is a standard fact that strong symplectic cobordisms can always be glued together along contactomorphic boundary components , thus the relations @xmath27 and @xmath28 define preorders on the contact category , i.e.  they are reflexive and transitive .",
    "they are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric , as is clear from some simple examples that we shall recall in a moment .",
    "regarding the empty set as a trivial example of a contact manifold , we say that @xmath29 is * strongly * ( or * exactly * ) * fillable * if @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 respectively ) .",
    "a @xmath0-dimensional contact manifold @xmath29 is likewise * weakly fillable * if there is a weak symplectic cobordism from @xmath32 to @xmath29 .",
    "for example , the tight @xmath0-sphere @xmath33 is exactly fillable , as it is the convex boundary of the unit @xmath34-ball with its standard symplectic structure .",
    "there are many known examples of contact @xmath0-manifolds that are not fillable by these various definitions : the original such result , that the so - called _ overtwisted _ contact manifolds are not weakly fillable , was proved by gromov @xcite and eliashberg @xcite .",
    "in contrast , etnyre and honda @xcite showed that every contact @xmath0-manifold admits a * symplectic cap * , meaning it satisfies @xmath35 , although @xmath36 is never true ( due to stokes theorem ) .",
    "there is an obvious obstruction to the relation @xmath37 whenever @xmath19 is strongly fillable but @xmath20 is not , e.g.  @xmath19 can not be the tight @xmath0-sphere if @xmath20 is overtwisted . put another way , symplectic cobordisms imply filling obstructions , as @xmath29 can not be fillable if it is cobordant to anything overtwisted .",
    "the following open question may be viewed as a test case for the existence of subtler obstructions to symplectic cobordisms .",
    "[ question : cob ] is every contact @xmath0-manifold @xmath29 that is not strongly fillable also symplectically cobordant to some overtwisted contact manifold @xmath38 ?",
    "the answer to the corresponding question for exact cobordisms is _ no _ : by an argument originally due to hofer @xcite , @xmath39 implies that every reeb vector field on @xmath29 admits a contractible periodic orbit , yet there are simple examples of contact manifolds without contractible orbits that are known to be non - fillable , e.g.  all of the tight @xmath0-tori other than the standard one .",
    "more generally , it has recently become clear that overtwistedness is only the first level in an infinite hierarchy of filling obstructions called _",
    "planar @xmath40-torsion _ for integers @xmath41 , cf .",
    "a contact manifold is overtwisted if and only if it has planar @xmath42-torsion , and there are many examples which are tight or have no giroux torsion but have planar @xmath40-torsion for some @xmath43 , and are thus not strongly fillable . the aforementioned argument of hofer",
    "then generalizes to define an algebraic filling obstruction @xcite that lives in symplectic field theory and sometimes also gives obstructions to exact cobordisms from @xmath40-torsion to @xmath44-torsion .",
    "our first main result says that no such obstructions exist for non - exact cobordisms , thus hinting at a possibly positive answer to question  [ question : cob ] .",
    "for a candidate counterexample . ]    [ thm : overtwisted ] every closed contact @xmath0-manifold with planar torsion admits a ( non - exact ) symplectic cobordism to an overtwisted contact manifold .",
    "this of course yields a new and comparatively low - tech proof of the fact , proved first in @xcite , that planar torsion obstructs strong fillings .",
    "it also generalizes a result proved by david gay in @xcite , that any contact manifold with giroux torsion at least two is cobordant to something overtwisted ; as shown in @xcite , positive giroux torsion implies planar @xmath14-torsion ( cf .  ",

    "overtwisted contact manifold admits a stein cobordism to any other connected contact @xmath0-manifold , and gay @xcite showed that the word `` connected '' can be removed from this statement at the cost of dropping the stein condition .",
    "we thus have the following consequence :    [ cor : equivalence ] every closed contact @xmath0-manifold with planar torsion is symplectically cobordant to every other closed contact @xmath0-manifold .",
    "it should be emphasized that due to the obstructions mentioned above , corollary  [ cor : equivalence ] is not true for _ exact _ cobordisms , not even if the positive boundary is required to be connected .",
    "in fact , there is no known example of an exact cobordism from anything tight to anything overtwisted , and many examples that are tight but non - fillable ( e.g.  the @xmath0-tori with positive giroux torsion ) certainly do not admit such cobordisms .",
    "there is also a version of theorem  [ thm : overtwisted ] that implies the more general obstruction to weak fillings proved in @xcite .",
    "recall ( see definitions  [ defn : planar ] and  [ defn : planartorsion ] ) that for a given closed @xmath45-form  @xmath46 on a contact @xmath0-manifold @xmath29 , we say that @xmath29 has _ @xmath46-separating _ planar torsion if it contains a planar torsion domain in which a certain set of embedded @xmath45-tori  @xmath47 all satisfy @xmath48 if this is true for all closed @xmath45-forms  @xmath46 , then @xmath29 is said to have _ fully separating _",

    "[ thm : weak ] suppose @xmath29 is a closed contact @xmath0-manifold with @xmath46-separating planar torsion for some closed @xmath45-form @xmath46 on  @xmath49 with @xmath50",

    ", weak symplectic cobordisms can be glued together along contactomorphic boundary components of opposite sign whenever the restrictions of the symplectic forms on the boundaries match ( see lemma  [ lemma : gluing ] ) .",
    "thus if @xmath29 has @xmath46-separating planar @xmath40-torsion and admits a weak filling @xmath10 with @xmath52 = [ \\omega ] \\in h^2_{{\\operatorname{dr}}}(m)$ ] , then theorem  [ thm : weak ] yields a weak filling of an overtwisted contact manifold , and hence a contradiction due to the well known theorem of gromov @xcite and eliashberg @xcite .",
    "we thus obtain a much simplified proof of the following result , which was proved in @xcite by a direct holomorphic curve argument and also follows from a computation of the twisted ech contact invariant in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath29 has @xmath46-separating planar torsion for some closed @xmath45-form  @xmath46 on  @xmath49 , then it does not admit any weak filling @xmath10 with @xmath52 = [ \\omega ] \\in h^2_{{\\operatorname{dr}}}(m)$ ] .",
    "in particular , if @xmath29 has fully separating planar torsion then it is not weakly fillable .",
    "we now state some related results that also apply to fillable contact manifolds .",
    "the aforementioned existence result of @xcite for symplectic caps was generalized independently by eliashberg @xcite and etnyre @xcite to weak cobordisms : they showed namely that for any @xmath29 with a closed @xmath45-form @xmath46 that dominates  @xmath53 , there is a symplectic cap @xmath10 with @xmath54 and @xmath51 .",
    "our next result concerns a large class of contact manifolds for which this cap may be assumed to have a certain very restrictive property .",

    "then @xmath29 admits a symplectic cap @xmath10 such that @xmath51 and there exists a symplectically embedded @xmath45-sphere @xmath56 with vanishing self - intersection number .",
    "as the work of mcduff @xcite makes clear , symplectic manifolds that contain symplectic @xmath42-spheres are quite special , and for instance any closed symplectic manifold obtained by gluing the cap from theorem  [ thm : caps ] to a filling of @xmath29 must be rational or ruled .",
    "an easy adaptation of the main result in @xcite also provides the following consequence , which was proved using much harder punctured holomorphic curve arguments in @xcite :    [ cor : separating ] suppose @xmath29 contains an @xmath46-separating partially planar domain for some closed @xmath45-form @xmath46 on  @xmath49 . if @xmath10 is a closed symplectic @xmath34-manifold and @xmath49 admits an embedding @xmath57 such that @xmath58 and @xmath59 = [ \\omega ] \\in h^2_{{\\operatorname{dr}}}(m)$ ] , then  @xmath60 separates  @xmath6 .",
    "since planar torsion domains are also partially planar domains , this implies that planar torsion is actually an obstruction to contact type embeddings into closed symplectic manifolds , not just symplectic fillings .",
    "note that examples of contact manifolds that admit non - separating embeddings arise from special types of symplectic fillings : we shall say that @xmath29 is ( strongly or weakly ) * hyper - fillable * if there is a connected ( strong or weak ) filling @xmath10 whose boundary is the disjoint union of @xmath29 with an arbitrary non - empty contact manifold .",
    "put another way , @xmath29 admits a connected * semi - filling * with disconnected boundary .",
    "given such a filling , one can always attach a symplectic @xmath14-handle to connect distinct boundary components and then cap off the boundary to realize @xmath29 as a non - separating contact hypersurface .",
    "various examples of contact manifolds that are or are not hyper - fillable have been known for many years :    * the tight @xmath0-sphere @xmath33 is not weakly hyper - fillable , by arguments due to gromov @xcite , eliashberg @xcite and mcduff @xcite .",

    "observe that any contact manifold cobordant to one for which corollary  [ cor : separating ] holds also can not be hyper - fillable : in particular this shows that not every contact @xmath0-manifold is cobordant to @xmath33 . we are thus led to an analogue of question  [ question : cob ] that also applies to fillable contact manifolds :    [ question : s3 ] does every closed and connected contact @xmath0-manifold @xmath29 that is not strongly hyper - fillable admit a connected symplectic cobordism to the tight @xmath0-sphere @xmath33 ?",

    "if  @xmath80 denotes the supported contact structure on  @xmath78 , a holomorphic curve argument in @xcite shows that @xmath81 is not strongly fillable , but it also does not appear to have planar torsion ( at least we do not see it from this construction ) since the planar piece has no boundary .",
    "it is not clear whether @xmath81 is cobordant to anything overtwisted , nor whether its ech contact invariant vanishes ( cf .  the discussion accompanying corollary  [ cor : ech ] below ) .",

    "it is important however to understand that these constructions are not truly _ local _ , as the attaching requires neighborhoods that are in some sense sufficiently large .",
    "this condition on the neighborhoods is most easily stated in the language of ( possibly blown up and summed ) open book decompositions  that is not necessarily the only natural setting in which these operations make sense , but it is the first that comes to mind .",
    "we have derived considerable inspiration from the symplectic capping technique introduced by eliashberg in @xcite .",
    "the goal of eliashberg s construction was somewhat different , namely to embed any weak symplectic filling into a closed symplectic manifold , but it can also be used to construct symplectic cobordisms between contact manifolds with supporting open books that are related to each other by capping off binding components .",
    "indeed , eliashberg s",
    "capping construction works as follows :    1 .   given @xmath29 with a supporting open book @xmath85 ,",

    "this transforms @xmath49 by a @xmath42-surgery along each binding component , producing a new @xmath0-manifold @xmath78 with a fibration @xmath89 whose fibers are the closed surfaces obtained by capping the original pages with disks .",
    "any symplectic structure on @xmath86\\times m$ ] dominating  @xmath53 can then be extended over the handles so that the fibers of @xmath89 are symplectic .",
    "2 .   cap off the boundary of the cobordism above by presenting @xmath78 as the boundary of a lefschetz fibration over the disk with closed fibers .",

    "@xcite ) , and we will show that the symplectic structure can always be arranged so as to produce a weak symplectic cobordism from @xmath29 to @xmath81 , where @xmath80 is supported by  @xmath92 . under some additional topological assumptions one can actually arrange the weak cobordism to be strong ; this variation on eliashberg",

    "we shall carry out this generalization below , though the reader may prefer to pretend @xmath94 on first reading , and this suffices for most of the applications we will discuss .",
    "the key to our construction will be to combine the above brand of handle attachment with a `` blown up '' version , in which a round handle is attached to @xmath29 along a @xmath45-torus that can be thought of as a blown up binding circle .",

    "the first step is to understand what kinds of blown up summed open books automatically support overtwisted contact structures : using eliashberg s classification theorem @xcite and giroux s criterion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , this naturally leads to the notion of planar @xmath42-torsion .",

    ", we remark that while theorems  [ thm : overtwisted ] and  [ thm : weak ] substantially simplify the proof that planar torsion is a filling obstruction , they do not reproduce all of the results in @xcite : in particular the technology of embedded contact homology is not yet far enough along to deduce the vanishing of the contact invariant from a non - exact cobordism .",

    "the moral is that whether one prefers to prove non - fillability results by direct holomorphic curve arguments or by constructing cobordisms to reduce them to previously known results , it is essentially the same thing : neither proof would be possible without the other .",
    "the plan for proving the main results is as follows .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : busobd ] by reviewing the fundamental definitions involving blown up summed open books and planar torsion , culminating with the ( more or less obvious ) observation that one can always use capping or decoupling surgery to decrease the order of a planar torsion domain . in  [ sec : model ] , we introduce a useful concrete model for a blown up summed open book and its supported contact structure .",

    "one useful application of the foliation constructed above is that we can now characterize all such curves precisely :    [ prop : nopositive ] suppose @xmath1054 is a finite energy @xmath1040-holomorphic curve that is connected , somewhere injective and has no positive ends .",
    "then  @xmath1055 is a leaf of  @xmath1046 , specifically it is an @xmath123-translation of the core @xmath1047 .",
    "there are no curves without positive ends outside the region of surgery since here the symplectic form is exact , thus we may assume  @xmath1055 intersects both the handle and its complement . if  @xmath1055 is a leaf of  @xmath1046 then it must be an @xmath123-translation of the core , as all other leaves have positive ends .",
    "if it is not a leaf of  @xmath1046 then it has a positive intersection with some leaf  @xmath1056 , and without loss of generality we may suppose that  @xmath1056 has only positive ends",
    ". then  @xmath1056 is homotopic in the moduli space to a holomorphic lift of a page of  @xmath137 , which we may assume lives in the region @xmath1057 for an arbitrarily large number @xmath165 and thus can not intersect  @xmath1055 .",
    "this is a contradiction , due to positivity of intersections .    to apply these constructions to ech , or to symplectic field theory for that matter , one must perturb @xmath577 and @xmath756 to contact structures and perturb  @xmath1040 with them .",
    "the @xmath1040-holomorphic leaves of  @xmath1046 will not generally behave well under this perturbation : a leaf with only positive ends for instance , if it has genus  @xmath640 , will have fredholm index @xmath1058 and thus disappears under any generic perturbation of the data unless @xmath1059 .",
    "proposition  [ prop : nopositive ] , however , should still hold under a sufficiently small perturbation , because for any sequence @xmath1060 of perturbed almost complex structures converging to  @xmath1040 , a sequence of @xmath1060-holomorphic curves should converge in the sense of @xcite to a @xmath1040-holomorphic building , and proposition  [ prop : nopositive ] determines what this building can look like .",
    "this is a variation on the uniqueness argument used in @xcite to prove vanishing of the ech contact invariant : higher genus holomorphic curves do not generically exist , but they remain useful for proving that no other curves can exist either ."
