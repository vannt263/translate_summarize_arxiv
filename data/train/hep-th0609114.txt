    "while the open spin-@xmath6 xxz quantum spin chain ( with diagonal boundary terms ) has been solved and well understood @xcite , the solution for the corresponding xxz chain with general integrable boundary terms , has remained unsolved .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model is given by @xcite & = & _ n=1^n-11 2 ( _ n^x_n+1^x+_n^y_n+1^y+_n^z_n+1^z ) + & & + 12 where @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9 are pauli matrices , @xmath10 is the bulk anisotropy parameter , @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 are the boundary parameters , and @xmath14 is the number of spins .",
    "however , the case of nondiagonal boundary terms with the boundary parameters satisfying certain constraint has been solved recently @xcite .",
    "hence , it would be desirable to find the solution for the general case , with such constraint removed . +",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review our bethe ansatz solutions for special case at roots of unity @xcite which we utilize to compute the boundary ( surface ) energy of the xxz chain @xcite .",
    "next , in section 3 , we present the bethe ansatz solution for the general case @xcite .",
    "this is followed by a brief conclusion of the paper together with some outline of possible future works on the subject in section 4 .",
    "here , the results are presented for odd values of @xmath15 , values , we refer readers to @xcite ] where @xmath15 is related to @xmath10 through @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the case with the following choice of boundary parameters ; @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath11 arbitrary .",
    "one crucial step here is to notice that certain functional relation which the transfer matrix , @xmath19 and its eigenvalues , @xmath20 obey at roots of unity @xcite , can be written as @xcite ( u ) = 0 , [ detzero ] we give an example of the functional relation below , for @xmath21 & & ( u ) ( u+ ) ( u+2 ) ( u+3 ) - ( u ) ( u+2 ) ( u+3 ) - ( u+ ) ( u ) ( u+3 ) + & & -(u+2 ) ( u ) ( u+ ) - ( u+3 ) ( u+ ) ( u+2 ) + & & + ( u ) ( u+2 ) + ( u+ ) ( u+3 ) = f(u ) . @xmath22 and",

    ", one can solve for @xmath25 .",
    "also , @xmath28 , as one would conclude from the crossing properties of @xmath20 and ( 8) below .",
    "the matrix above has the following symmetry , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "other @xmath24 matrices we found with stronger symmetry yield inconsistent results .",

[ smatrix ] hence , we have h^(1)(u ) & = & 8 ^ 2n+1(u+2)^2(u+ ) ( u+2 ) ( 2u+3 ) , the above symmetry for the present @xmath32 suggests a null eigenvector , @xmath33 with the following ansatz for @xmath34 q_a(u ) = _ j=1^m_a ( u - u_j^(a ) ) ( u + u_j^(a ) + ) , a = 1 , 2 , note that there are two @xmath35 functions , a direct consequence of the weaker symmetry mentioned above .",
