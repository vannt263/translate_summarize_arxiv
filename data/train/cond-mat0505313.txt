    "gaussian ( or normal ) distribution @xcite is one of the most well - known and fundamental distributions in many fields of science , e.g. , an error distribution in measurement , a probability distribution of a fluctuating physical quantity in statistical mechanics , which accounts for the successes of boltzmann - gibbs exponential distributions @xcite .",

    "they are slightly different each other .",
    "although the difference is not so large , this means that if an experimental data is well fitted with @xmath0-exponential function it should not be well fitted with @xmath2-exponential one , and vice versa . until now in the literature",
    "there are only a few experimental evidences which are well fitted with @xmath0-exponential probability distributions : the flux distribution of the cosmic rays extends over 13 decades in energy @xcite ; the rain events in meteorology ( the number density of rain events versus the event size ) @xcite ; and the analysis of the fracture problem ( the relation between the length of a transversal cut of the conducting thin ribbon and the electrical resistance ) @xcite .",

    "in fact , applying the similar argument to the @xmath2-deformed functions , we can obtain the @xmath2-gaussian function @xmath32 , where two lagrange multiplier @xmath33 and @xmath34 are introduced .",

    "let us consider the same situation as conventional gauss law of error @xcite , i.e. , we get @xmath36 observed values : @xmath37as the results of @xmath36 measurements for certain observations . each observed value @xmath38 is a result of the measurement of identically distributed random variable @xmath39 .",
    "there exists a true value @xmath18 satisfying the _ additive _ relation : @xmath40where each of @xmath41 is an error in each observation of the true value @xmath18 .",

    "* theorem * for a given set of the data @xmath64 , if the likelihood function @xmath65 of a variable @xmath66 , which is defined by @xmath67 takes the maximum at @xmath68 then the probability density function @xmath45 must be a @xmath0-gaussian distribution : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a @xmath0-dependent positive constant , and @xmath71 is a @xmath0-dependent normalization factor .    taking the @xmath0-logarithm of the both side of the likelihood function @xmath72 in eq .",
    "leads to @xmath73 where the property ( [ property of ln_kappa ] ) is used . differentiating the above formula eq . with respect to @xmath74 , we have@xmath75 when @xmath76 the likelihood function @xmath77 takes the maximum , so that @xmath78 let @xmath79 and @xmath80 be defined by @xmath81 respectively .",
    "then eq . can be rewritten to @xmath82 on the other hand , from eq .",

    "we have shown two different methods to derive the @xmath0-gaussian distribution , i.e. , both maximum entropy and maximum likelihood principles are generalized by utilizing @xmath0-deformed functions and associated multiplication operation ( @xmath0-product ) .",
    "both @xmath0-generalized methods reduce to the standard ones , respectively , in the limit of @xmath16 .",
    "as the @xmath2-product is the most fundamental ingredient in the @xmath2-generalization of gauss law of error @xcite , the @xmath0-product enables us generalizing gauss law of error for the @xmath0-gaussian .",
    "as seen in both @xmath2- and @xmath0-generalizations of the maximum likelihood principle , we remark that for any set of one - parameter generalizations of exponential and logarithmic functions we can generalize the likelihood function by introducing a suitable multiplication operation or product .",

    "but @xmath0-products are replaced with the products @xmath93 .",
    "the associated gaussian distribution can be obtained from this @xmath94-parameter generalization of gauss law of error .",
    "the difference among @xmath2- , @xmath0- , and other generalizations of gauss law of error apparently lies in the definition of each generalized likelihood function in terms of the generalized products . for the standard case",
