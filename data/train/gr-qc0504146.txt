    "the purpose of this letter is to discuss the relative motion of a spinning test particle in a gravitational field with respect to a nearby geodesic observer . to compare the theory with observation",
    ", it proves useful to express such relative motion in a quasi - inertial fermi normal coordinate system that can be set up along the worldline of the reference observer @xcite .",
    "this approach has been recently employed for the general motion of a test particle ; in particular , astrophysically significant results have been obtained for ultrarelativistic relative motion , i.e. motion with relative speed above a critical speed given by @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the present work aims to extend previous results to the case of a spinning test mass .",
    "we choose units such that @xmath1 in the rest of this letter .",
    "the motion of an extended body in a gravitational field can be described using the mathisson - papapetrou - dixon equations @xcite .",
    "if we neglect the quadrupole and higher moments of the particle , then the mathisson - papapetrou ( `` pole - dipole '' ) equations suffice ; these are given by @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the proper time , @xmath4 is the four - velocity , @xmath5 is the four - momentum of the particle and @xmath6 is its spin tensor .",
    "suppose that the particle has mass @xmath7 and spin @xmath8 and is moving in the gravitational field of an astronomical mass @xmath9 .",
    "in general , the dipole interaction must be much smaller than the monopole interaction in our approximation scheme ; thus , the spin - curvature force in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) , @xmath10 , must be much smaller than the newtonian force @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the mller radius  @xcite of the particle , @xmath12 , should be much smaller than the distance @xmath13 between @xmath7 and @xmath14",
    ".    equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) must be supplemented with additional constraints on the spin tensor . for extended bodies",
    ", the appropriate condition turns out to be @xcite @xmath15    in section [ sec:2 ] , we develop an iterative scheme for the solution of equations ( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] is devoted to a discussion of the spin - curvature force .",
    "the equations of relative motion are developed in section [ sec:4 ] and specialized to the exterior kerr spacetime in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the effects of spin - curvature coupling along the rotation axis of a kerr black hole are of particular relevance to current theoretical speculation on the nature of gamma ray bursts .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of our results in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "it is necessary to develop an iterative approximation method for the solution of equations ( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) .",
    "we note that these equations imply that @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath8 is the constant magnitude of the spin of the particle . differentiating ( [ eq:3 ] ) with respect to proper time and using ( [ eq:2 ] ) results in @xmath18 next ,",
    "we multiply ( [ eq:5 ] ) by @xmath19 and use the antisymmetry of the spin tensor to get @xmath20 thus either @xmath21 or @xmath22 , where @xmath7 has the interpretation of the constant mass of the spinning particle .",
    "the signature of the spacetime metric is assumed to be @xmath23 throughout this work .",
    "the multipole approximation method discussed in the previous section implies that @xmath5 should be approximately parallel to @xmath24 except for small corrections due to the spin of the particle ; in fact , multiplication of ( [ eq:2 ] ) with @xmath25 results in @xmath26 we therefore assume that @xmath27 and write @xmath28 where the extra term @xmath29 is the small contribution of the spin to the canonical momentum . from ( [ eq:8 ] )",
    ", we find @xmath30 ; on the other hand , multiplying ( [ eq:5 ] ) with @xmath31 results in @xmath32 it thus follows from equations  ( [ eq:8 ] ) and  ( [ eq:9 ] ) that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is @xmath35 .    differentiating ( [ eq:8 ] ) with respect to @xmath3 and using ( [ eq:1 ] ) we get @xmath36 to determine @xmath29 ,",
    "we substitute ( [ eq:8 ] ) in ( [ eq:5 ] ) to get @xmath37 it is clear from equations ( [ eq:10])-([eq:12 ] ) that @xmath29 is generally small and of order @xmath38 ; moreover , @xmath39 is a force that is of second order in the spin of the particle . in this way , it is possible to develop an iterative scheme based on the small parameter @xmath40 . restricting our treatment to effects that are of first order in the spin , we drop @xmath41 in ( [ eq:11 ] ) and focus on the mathisson - papapetrou spin - curvature force @xmath42    it is useful to define the spin vector @xmath43 of the extended test particle in general as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the levi - civita tensor and @xmath46 is the alternating symbol with @xmath47 . equation ( [ eq:14 ] )",
    "implies that @xmath48 ; moreover , @xmath49 it follows from the results of this section that to linear order in spin , one can replace @xmath5 by @xmath50 in equations ( [ eq:14 ] ) and ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",
    "consider the linear post - newtonian gravitational field of a source with mass @xmath14 and angular momentum @xmath51 given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the newtonian gravitoelectric potential , @xmath54 is the gravitomagnetic vector potential and @xmath55 .",
    "the gravitomagnetic field is given by @xmath56 in analogy with electrodynamics .",
    "if an ideal torque - free test gyroscope is placed at @xmath57 , its precession frequency is given by @xmath58,\\label{eq:17}\\ ] ] so that the gravitomagnetic field has the interpretation of a precession frequency in conformity with the gravitational larmor theorem .",
    "expressing the metric tensor in ( [ eq:16 ] ) as @xmath59 , we note that @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding riemann curvature tensor is given by @xmath63    imagine a free test particle @xmath64 initially at rest in the stationary gravitational field of the source .",
    "the particle carries an orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is its local temporal axis and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , are its local spatial axes .",

    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 are the electric and magnetic components of the curvature , respectively , and are @xmath75 symmetric and traceless matrices given by @xmath76,\\label{eq:21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the spin - curvature force experienced by the extended test particle @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 , so that using equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) , @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "more explicitly , this force can be written as @xmath83 which is the gravitational analog of the stern - gerlach force .",
    "as an illustration , let us suppose that @xmath79 is initially at rest on the @xmath84 axis with its spin along the @xmath84 direction , which we take to be the rotation axis of the source ; then , @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "this mathisson - papapetrou force is repulsive ( attractive ) if @xmath79 spins in the same ( opposite ) sense as the rotation of the central source .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to note that this force is always smaller than the newtonian force of attraction ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "indeed , in realistic astrophysical situations , the mathisson - papapetrou dipole force would be very small in comparison with the newtonian monopole force .",
    "this holds in general relativistic situations as well , as demonstrated in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "if instead of being at rest , @xmath79 is initially boosted with speed @xmath88 along the @xmath84 axis , then the spin - curvature force @xmath89 experienced by the boosted particle can be obtained via a lorentz transformation . in fact , the spin tensor remains invariant under a boost along the @xmath84 axis , so that @xmath90 are the only nonzero components of the spin tensor .",
    "as discussed in the next section , the curvature tensor remains invariant as well . in any case",
    ", the nonzero components of @xmath89 can be simply calculated to be @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 is given by equation  ( [ eq:24 ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that equations  ( [ eq:22])([eq:25 ] ) are valid only to first order in the spin of the extended test particle .",
    "similar results have been derived before using the other principal interpretation of the mathisson - papapetrou equations , namely , within the context of a classical point particle with `` intrinsic '' spin ; that is , a point gyro that satisfies instead of ( [ eq:3 ] ) the pirani supplementary conditions @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "imagine a free test `` observer '' @xmath95 following a timelike geodesic in the exterior gravitational field of an astronomical source .",
    "let @xmath96 be an orthonormal tetrad frame that is parallel transported along the worldline of @xmath95 .",
    "a fermi normal coordinate system @xmath97 can be set up in the neighborhood of this worldline based on @xmath98 as the local axes such that @xmath95 remains at the spatial origin of this coordinate system .",
    "thus @xmath95 has fermi coordinates @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the proper time of @xmath95 .",
    "we need to express the motion of a spinning test particle @xmath79 @xmath101 with respect to @xmath95 .",
    "the equation of relative motion has been derived in general in @xcite and is given by @xmath102 where the four - velocity @xmath24 in fermi coordinates is @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "the requirement that the worldline of @xmath79 be timelike can be expressed as @xmath105 the metric in fermi coordinates is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 the fermi coordinates are admissible in a cylindrical region with @xmath108 along the reference worldline such that @xmath109 is a certain minimum radius of curvature of spacetime .",
    "in the next section , equation ( [ eq:27 ] ) is studied for the case of motion along the rotation axis of a kerr source .",
    "the motion of spinning test particles in the kerr field has been the subject of previous investigations @xcite ; however , in the present work we consider the deviation of such motion relative to a reference geodesic in the context of a fermi normal coordinate system that is constructed along the reference geodesic .",
    "this approach turns out to be of direct observational relevance for the motion of clumps in astrophysical jets as discussed in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to study the motion of @xmath79 relative to @xmath95 along the rotation axis of a kerr source .",
    "the kerr metric is given by @xmath110 in boyer - lindquist coordinates , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath113 are respectively the mass and the specific angular momentum ( @xmath114 ) of the source .",
    "we assume that the free reference particle @xmath95 moves along the rotation axis on an escape trajectory .",
    "the geodesic equations of motion of @xmath95 reduce to @xmath115 here @xmath116 is a constant of integration such that for @xmath117 is the lorentz factor of the particle as measured by the static inertial observers at spatial infinity .",
    "we integrate system ( [ eq:32 ] ) with the initial conditions that at @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , the spinning test particle @xmath79 also starts from this same event with speed @xmath121 relative to @xmath95 and moves along the rotation axis . to describe this relative motion , we establish a fermi coordinate system along the worldline of @xmath95 . in @xmath122 coordinates , the orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath123 is such that @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are given by  ( [ eq:32 ] ) .",
    "the axial symmetry about the rotation axis implies that there is a simple rotational degeneracy in the choice of @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the projection of the curvature tensor on the tetrad frame of @xmath95 , given by equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) , turns out to be independent of the explicit choice for @xmath127 and @xmath128 and may be expressed as before in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74 such that @xmath129 and @xmath130 , where @xmath131 thus for a given @xmath13 , the curvature measured by @xmath95 is completely independent of @xmath132 .",
    "this remarkable fact is a consequence of the degenerate nature of the kerr solution , which implies that the rotation axis of the exterior kerr spacetime corresponds to two special tidal directions for ingoing and outgoing trajectories ; in fact , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are invariant under a boost along the rotation axis @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath79 relative to @xmath95 is given by equations ( [ eq:26 ] ) and ( [ eq:27 ] ) , where we need to evaluate the force term involving @xmath133 and @xmath134 in the fermi system .",
    "to simplify matters , we assume that @xmath135 , which can be determined by equation ( [ eq:34 ] ) , and @xmath136 . as in the previous section ,",
    "the spin of the test mass @xmath79 is assumed to be along the axis of rotation , so that the only nonzero components of the spin tensor are @xmath137 .",
    "it follows that @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the only nonzero components of @xmath140 , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 is the mller radius of @xmath79 . with these simplifications and taking only the terms given in ( [ eq:29 ] ) into account , equation ( [ eq:27 ] ) reduces to @xmath143 this equation takes a dimensionless form if all lengths are expressed in units of @xmath144 and @xmath145 is replaced by @xmath146",
    ". then , @xmath147 by assumption .",
    "the term @xmath148 in equation ( [ eq:35 ] ) is due to the fact that we express the equation of motion of @xmath79 with respect to the fermi time @xmath100 rather than @xmath3 , the proper time of @xmath79 . for @xmath149 , equation ( [ eq:35 ] )",
    "reduces to a jacobi - type equation for the relative motion of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath95 @xcite .    to characterize the relative motion invariantly ,",
    "let us imagine a set of static observers in the fermi system situated along the @xmath150 axis and let @xmath151 be the lorentz factor of @xmath79 as measured by these static fermi observers that are in general accelerated .",
    "then @xmath152 , where @xmath153 in our approximation scheme ; therefore , @xmath154 , since @xmath155 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:35 ] ) contains the `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' curvatures @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively , that can be expressed as functions of the fermi coordinate time @xmath100 .",
    "that is , the equation for @xmath158 in ( [ eq:32 ] ) can be integrated such that with @xmath159 , we find @xmath160 and hence @xmath161 and @xmath162 that must then be substituted in ( [ eq:35 ] ) .",
    "this system has been numerically integrated with initial conditions that at @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , and the results are presented in figures 1 and 2 , where @xmath151 is plotted versus @xmath166 for ultrarelativistic relative motion along the rotation axis of a maximal @xmath167 kerr source .",
    "we note that with our initial conditions both @xmath168 and @xmath169 at @xmath170 are given by @xmath171 , which is the lorentz factor corresponding to @xmath172 . for motion along the @xmath150 axis , @xmath154 ; however , it turns out that a similar plot for @xmath168 would be indistinguishable from figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we choose @xmath173 in figures 1 and 2 , since the results turn out to be independent of the choice of @xmath132 so long as @xmath95 is slowly outgoing . for highly ultrarelativistic motion as in figure  [ fig:1 ] , the spin of the clump has a negligible influence on its deceleration .",
    "in fact , with the same conditions as in figure  [ fig:1 ] but for @xmath174 and 10 , the resulting figures turn out to be indistinguishable from figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "let us note that @xmath175 is not allowed here , since the back reaction of such a particle on the gravitational field of the source can not be neglected and hence our test particle approximation scheme would break down .",
    "the case where the spin of @xmath79 is antiparallel to the @xmath150 axis can be treated by formally letting @xmath176 .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the graphs in the top panel are slightly above the corresponding ones in the bottom panel , though the trends are essentially the same .",
    "let us suppose that the clump is homogeneous and cylindrical with radius @xmath177 , and the axis of the cylinder coincides with the @xmath150 axis .",
    "thus @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the frequency of rotation of the clump such that @xmath180 .",
    "moreover , @xmath181 implies that @xmath182 . in figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] we have @xmath183",
    "; therefore , we have chosen @xmath184 to represent in effect the maximum spin of the clump .",
    "this choice is consistent with various scenarios that have been proposed for jet creation near the poles of a rapidly rotating kerr black hole ( see  @xcite , chapters 9 and 11 , and the references cited therein ) .",
    "if the initial lorentz factor @xmath185 of @xmath79 is close to the critical value @xmath186 , then the spin - curvature force is rather small but may not be negligible very close to the central black hole .",
    "however , for @xmath187 , the contribution of the spin - curvature force turns out to be essentially negligible and the spinning particle @xmath79 decelerates toward the critical speed .",
    "this confirms our previous work  @xcite on the speed of jets in microquasars  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the current speculation  @xcite that the spin - curvature coupling could be a prominent driver of astrophysical jets from black holes is overly optimistic .",
    "we show quite generally that the standard tidal effects  @xcite will dominate the spin - curvature effects for plasma clumps in astrophysical jets .",
