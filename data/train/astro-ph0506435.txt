    "our understanding of the formation of binary and multiple stellar systems in clusters lags significantly behind that of isolated star formation , and yet this is the mode in which most stars form . the origin of the problem is the following : the distribution of the companion - star fraction for t tauri stars and field g dwarfs peaks at separations @xmath760  au ( e.g. , patience et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the ability to resolve structure on these size scales _ during _ the star formation process , when the protostars are deeply embedded and invisible at optical and infrared wavelengths , is not yet routinely available .",
    "distinguishing between the possible binary formation mechanisms , such as prompt fragmentation during collapse or the formation of instabilities in massive disks ( tohline 2002 ) , therefore remains difficult . until the instruments needed to test these theories observationally become available , we must focus on identifying binary protostars and on understanding their interactions with their immediate environments .",
    "iras  16293@xmath02422 was one of the first protostars to be identified as a potential binary system , based on the separation of the millimeter continuum emission into two peaks ( mundy , wilking , & myers 1986 ) , and on the detection of centimeter radio continuum emission from each component ( wootten 1989 ) .",
    "since then it has been extensively studied using single - dish telescopes and interferometers , and has been found to drive two separate co outflows ( mizuno et al .  1990 ; stark et al.2004 ) .",
    "to date it has been assumed that each of the binary components drives one of the outflows , although the northern binary component , source b , exhibits very narrow linewidths and little evidence of high velocity gas close to the source .",
    "this latter fact led stark et al.(2004 ) to propose that source b is a t tauri star and that the outflow it drove in the past is now a fossil flow , but this interpretation also has its problems .",
    "thus it is not even clear yet which sources drive which outflows .",
    "iras  16293@xmath02422 also exhibits strong emission from organic and other species more typically associated with hot cores in massive star - forming regions ( e.g. , van dishoeck & blake 1998 ) , especially at the position of the southern component , source a ( bottinelli et al.2004 ; kuan et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "iras  16293@xmath02422 was also one of the first sources for which the detection of infall in the surrounding envelope was claimed ( walker et al .",
    "1986 ) , based on redshifted self - absorption observed in a line of cs .",
    "the presence of the outflows and other velocity gradients across the cloud core made the claim controversial , however ( menten et al.1987 ; narayanan , walker , & buckley 1998 ) .",
    "there remain , therefore , several outstanding issues relating to the nature of the components of the binary system in iras  16293@xmath02422 : the relative evolutionary states of the two components ; the origin of the two outflows ; the nature of the hot core emission and its relationship to the two binary components ; and the dynamics of the gas associated with the two components including the identification of gravitational collapse .",
    "the high spatial resolution now available with the submillimeter array ( sma ) , and the wide bandwidth enabling many spectral lines to be covered simultaneously , makes this an ideal instrument with which to try to answer some of the outstanding questions relating to iras  16293@xmath02422 .",
    "the association of this source with strong , spatially - compact dust emission also raises the prospect of excellent image quality using self - calibration techniques ( pearson & readhead 1984 ) .",
    "the particular frequency settings chosen for the sma observations presented here were aimed at optimizing the possibility of detecting the high dipole - moment molecule h@xmath8co in absorption against the compact dust emission , as discussed in section  [ infall ] .",
    "many observations of iras  16293@xmath02422 have also been made using the very large array ( vla ) over the years , establishing one of the longest time baselines for high - resolution centimeter radio measurements of any source .",
    "here we combine new sma data with an analysis of archival vla data spanning 18 years , shedding new light on the nature of the centimeter and millimeter sources embedded in the cloud core .",
    "iras  16293@xmath02422 lies in the l1689 dark cloud within the @xmath3 ophiuchi star - forming region .",
    "the distance to @xmath3 oph has been reported to be 160  pc based on optical and infrared photometry of stars associated with the @xmath3 oph cloud ( chini 1981 ) , and more recently a distance of 120  pc was obtained from the reddening of optical hipparcos and tycho data ( knude & hg 1998 ) .",
    "the high extinction toward @xmath3 oph limits optical reddening techniques to the outer edges of the cloud . for this reason , and to enable direct comparison with most of the published literature on iras  16293@xmath02422 , we assume a distance of 160  pc",
    ". however , derived quantities that depend on distance are given with @xmath9 explicit , and if the interpretation of any result depends sensitively on @xmath9 this is discussed .",
    "the submillimeter observations of iras  16293@xmath02422 were made using the sma located on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "data were obtained on 2004 june 25 and 2004 july 27 , in its `` extended '' and `` compact '' configurations respectively .",
    "the correlator was configured to cover 2  ghz of bandwidth , centered close to the frequency of the h@xmath8co @xmath10 line at 300.836635  ghz , in the lower sideband of the receiver .",
    "the intermediate frequency of the sma is 5  ghz , giving an upper sideband centered 10  ghz higher .",
    "data are obtained from both sidebands .",
    "the instrumental phase and amplitude variations were monitored by observing the nearby calibrators nrao  530 and pks  j1625@xmath02527 .",
    "absolute flux calibration was obtained from observations of callisto and the quasar 3c454.3 , which was assumed to have a flux density of 4.6  jy at 300  ghz .",
    "the spectral response of the bandpass was obtained from measurements of 3c454.3 and pks  j1924@xmath02914 . the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration is estimated to be 10% for the continuum , but is somewhat worse ( @xmath11% ) for individual channels in the spectral line data because of the signal - to - noise ratio obtained for the bandpass calibration .",
    "the 2  ghz total bandpass was divided into 24 overlapping correlator segments .",
    "twenty - three of these were set up to have 128 channels covering 104  mhz ( channel separation 0.8125  mhz ) .",
    "the other segment had 512 channels over the same bandwidth , centered on the h@xmath8co line , to provide a spectral resolution of 0.203  mhz ( 0.2  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the lower sideband in particular contained several strong emission lines , so a continuum dataset was formed from an average of the line - free channels in the lower and upper sidebands .",
    "this continuum emission was then subtracted from the spectral line data .",
    "four of the correlator segments at the high(low ) frequency end of the lower(upper ) sideband exhibited problems , and have been excluded from the data entirely .",
    "the data were reduced using the sma data reduction package mir and also using miriad and aips .",
    "the continuum emission is strong enough for self - calibration techniques to be used to correct for tropospheric phase fluctuations on timescales shorter than the observations of the phase calibrators .",
    "the synthesized clean beam using an aips robust weighting of 0 , intermediate between natural and uniform to optimize both resolution and sensitivity ( briggs 1995 ) , is @xmath12 at p.a .",
    "24@xmath13 , and the rms noise in the resulting continuum image is 19  mjy  beam@xmath2 .",
    "this noise level is approximately a factor of 10 times the theoretical noise expected for typical system temperatures of 400  k , and is primarily due to the problems of imaging sources comprising considerable extended emission using a sparse array .",
    "the rms noise in continuum - subracted , line - free channels is approximately 3 times theoretical .",
    "the primary beam of the sma at the frequency of these observations is approximately 34@xmath14 fwhm .",
    "none of the images presented here has had a primary beam correction applied for display purposes , but all of the quantitative results have been obtained from images that have been corrected for the response of the primary beam .",
    "we have also retrieved all of the available continuum data for iras  16293@xmath02422 from the vla archive that have sufficient resolution to separate components a and b ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "most of these have previously been reported in the literature , and table  [ archive_sum ] summarizes the datasets and gives references to the descriptions of those data ; the details of the observing parameters can be found in these references .",
    "for all the data not previously published , the time - dependent amplitude and phases were calibrated using the quasars pks  j1626@xmath02951 or pks  j1625@xmath02527 , and the absolute flux density scale was obtained from measurements of 3c286 . the uncertainty in the overall absolute flux density scale used by the vla is estimated to be 5% from 0.4 to 15  ghz ( baars et al .",
    "1977 ) , and 10% at 22 and 43  ghz",
    ". however , there is some evidence of variability in the emission from source a from multi - epoch vla measurements ( see section  [ results_var ] below ) , so an overall uncertainty of 10% is also assumed for this source at the lower frequencies where only one epoch is available , namely , 1.5 and 5  ghz .",
    "all the data were reduced and imaged using aips .",
    "while in general our images and flux densities agree to within 2-@xmath16 of those previously published , there is one exception .",
    "the 15  ghz image from wootten ( 1989 ) shows that source a comprises two objects , denoted a1 and a2 , with a1 having a peak flux density per beam approximately three times stronger than a2 .",
    "our image , on the other hand , shows that the two components have comparable peak flux densities per beam .",
    "the difference arises because self - calibration using the 5  ghz image as a model was applied to the data presented by wootten .",
    "self - calibration can only improve an image if there is a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio in the visibility data ; unfortunately , this is not the case for the 15  ghz data , and under these circumstances false source structure can be introduced if self - calibration is used .",
    "our image has not had any self - calibration applied , and we believe it to be more reliable than that presented by wootten .",
    "all the archival vla data were observed in b1950 coordinates . for comparison with the sma data",
    "all the vla data have been precessed to j2000 . furthermore ,",
    "the position used for one of the phase calibrators , pks  j1626@xmath02951 , has been refined and improved over the years .",
    "all the vla data using pks  j1626@xmath02951 as a phase calibrator have therefore been adjusted to match the latest position in the vla calibrator manual , of r.a .",

    "power - law fits to the interferometric data , @xmath21 , are also plotted for @xmath22  ghz and @xmath23  ghz .",
    "the fact that sources a and b are embedded in extended emission from the surrounding envelope in fact makes the spectral indices derived from formal fits to the @xmath23  ghz data rather more uncertain than the errors given in fig .",
    "[ sed ] , since no attempt has been made here to match the @xmath24-@xmath25 coverage at each frequency . indeed , that this is a potential problem can clearly be seen for the 230  ghz flux density from bottinelli et al .",

    "discussion of an individual component will refer directly to the name of that component .      in order to investigate the relationship between the submillimeter emission and the radio continuum sources , we first need to account for the proper motion of the sources .",
    "the proper motion of sources a and b has been reported previously by loinard ( 2002 ) , based on two epochs of vla 8  ghz data ( 1989 and 1994 ) , and indicate motion presumably associated with the l1689n cloud in which sources a and b are embedded ( see also curiel et al .",
    "when observed at high resolution the centimeter radio emission from source a comprises two components , denoted a1 ( to the east ) and a2 ( to the west ) by wootten ( 1989 ) , separated by 0.35@xmath14 .",
    "we show below that the overall structure of the centimeter radio emission from source a has been changing with time , so the simpler structure of source b makes measurement of its proper motion more straightforward . in fig .",
    "[ pmotions ] we plot the position of source b derived from the sma data , and all the vla data having a resolution of 1@xmath14 or better , as a function of time , along with the offset between sources a2 and b , and between a1 and a2 , for those measurements which resolve the two components of source a. fig .  [ pmotions ] demonstrates that the proper motion of sources a2 and b are in common , and that their motion is primarily in declination .",
    "the overall proper motion of sources a2 and b , 17  mas  yr@xmath2 , corresponds to @xmath33  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "[ pmotions ] also illustrates significant motion of a1 relative to a2 , amounting to @xmath34  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we have corrected for the proper motions described above , and other uncertainties in the absolute positions caused by using different quasars for the phase calibration for some of the measurements , by shifting all the archival vla to align source b with the 1  mm position in table  [ compact ] .",
    "[ overlays ] presents the result of overlaying the shifted radio continuum emission on the 1  mm super - resolution continuum image .",
    "when observed with sufficient resolution to separate the two centimeter radio sources a1 and a2 it is clear first that their orientation has been changing over the years as indicated in fig .  [ pmotions ] , and second that they lie on either side of the submillimeter continuum source aa . in fig .",
    "[ pangle ] we plot the projected separation between a1 and a2 , and their position angle , as a function of time . considering only the 8  ghz data we might conclude that the separation between a1 and a2 has been increasing slightly , and that the rate at which the position angle is changing is slowing down .",
    "however , this conclusion becomes marginal when the results at other frequencies are included .",
    "[ pmotions ] shows that a linear fit to the position offsets in r.a . and",
    "matches the data well .",
    "the projected separation between a1 and a2 has remained constant , at @xmath35 , while the position angle is equally well - fitted by a straight line as by a second order polynomial function . the quadratic function shown in fig .",
    "[ pangle ] ( dotted line ) turns over in 2014 , so regular monitoring will be needed over the next few years to establish whether the rate of change in position angle is indeed slowing down , as suggested by the three 8  ghz points .",
    "since the 1  mm sma data are not able to resolve the separation of the two centimeter radio sources , it is important to establish whether the apparent location of aa between a1 and a2 in the super - resolution image is real , or whether the location of the clean components just corresponds to the centroid of submillimeter emission associated directly with a1 and a2 . to test this",
    "we have made simulated images comprising a source at ab , and sources at the positions of a1 and a2 from epoch 2003.65 ( the most recent vla data ) with a total flux that of aa given in table  [ compact ] .",
    "we find that for a flux ratio @xmath36 of unity the peak is indeed located at the observed position of aa in fig .",
    "[ cont_su ] . for a flux ratio of 1.8 , the same",
    "as that observed at 8  ghz for this epoch , the peak position would be offset by 0.12@xmath14 , which is more than 6-@xmath16 away from that measured .",
    "we therefore conclude that if the centimeter radio sources a1 and a2 are each associated with dust continuum emission , their submillimeter flux ratio is close to unity .",
    "the resulting implications for the nature of aa , a1 , and a2 is discussed further in section  [ discussion ] .      along with the clear secular structural evolution of the radio emission from source",
    "a shown in fig .",
    "[ overlays ] , there is also evidence for flux variability .",
    "[ fluxvar ] illustrates the integrated flux density for sources a and b as a function of time at 8 , 15 , and 22  ghz , where the error bars include the absolute flux uncertainty described in section  [ obs_radio ] . at all",
    "three frequencies , source b is consistent with being nonvariable , apart from the earliest 15  ghz measurement which comes from the data first presented by wootten ( 1989 ) . these data",
    "suffered significantly from poor tropospheric phase stability , and an analysis of images of the phase calibrator for this epoch suggests that the observed flux densities for iras  16293@xmath02422 are @xmath11% too low due to the decorrelation .",
    "we have not , therefore , included the flux density measurements from this epoch in the average 15  ghz flux densities plotted in fig .",

    "thus we conclude that the flux density of source b is constant in time , at all three frequencies measured .",
    "source a , on the other hand , clearly exhibits a trend of decreasing flux density between 1988 and 2003 at both 8 and 15  ghz , while the spectral index remains approximately constant .",
    "the observations able to separate the centimeter radio components show that the emission from both a1 and a2 has been decreasing , but that a1 is fading faster than a2 , with @xmath37 around epoch 1990 , compared to @xmath38 in 2003 . during this time",
    "the position angle of the vector joining a1 and a2 has traversed the position angle of the vector joining the submillimeter components aa and ab ( see fig .",
    "[ overlays ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the dramatic variability of a1 has been produced by the interaction of a wind or jet with ab and/or dense gas in its immediate environment , or from intrinsic variability of the source of ionized gas .",

    "most of this motion is that associated with the @xmath3 ophiuchi molecular cloud , but there is also a significant relative motion of the centimeter radio sources a1 and a2 , which excludes the possibility that these two sources are gravitationally bound unless a1 is in a highly eccentric orbit and is observed at periastron , the probability of which is low .",
    "sources a and b are separated by only 5.2@xmath14 [ @xmath263  au ] , yet their properties differ dramatically .",
    "source b is a single source at all frequencies observed to date , the highest resolution being 43  ghz with a beam @xmath148  mas , or @xmath264  au .",
    "the continuum emission originates from optically - thick dust even at a frequency of 8  ghz , and exhibits brightness temperatures of 350400  k on size scales of 510  au .",
    "source b is responsible for at least half the total luminosity of iras  16293@xmath02422 .",
    "the molecular emission from source b exhibits narrow line widths , with no sign of outflow .",
    "combined with its high luminosity ( which is presumably dominated by accretion ) this suggests that source b may not even have begun a phase of significant mass loss yet .",
    "we show that source a , on the other hand , probably comprises three stellar components .",
    "one is the centimeter radio source a2 , which we identify as the driving source of the large - scale ne  sw molecular outflow .",
    "the second is an as - yet unidentified companion to a2 which drives a precessing jet responsible for shock - ionized centimeter emission at a1 . the strongest submillimeter continuum emission from source a , denoted aa , peaks between the radio sources a1 and a2 , but the resolution of the sma is insufficient to tell whether this marks the position of the companion to a2 , or the centroid of submillimeter emission from a1 and a2 .",
    "we suggest that this companion is responsible for the large - scale east  west molecular outflow , which is messy and has a wider opening angle than the ne ",
    "sw flow , all of which can be explained by a variable jet direction .",
    "finally , we also identify a new submillimeter source 0.64@xmath14 away from aa , which we denote ab .",
    "this source is too far from aa to be responsible for the precession of the jet .",
    "most of the molecular emission originates from source a , and the overall kinematics of the envelope are in the opposite sense to that of the outflows , with redshifted emission to the south , and blueshifted emission to the north .",
    "there is , however , one compact kinematic feature centered on source a that is similar to the large - scale east  west outflow , confirming this as its origin .",
    "iras  16293@xmath02422 is one of only a handful of low - mass protostars which exhibits emission from molecules more commonly associated with hot cores in regions of massive star formation .",
    "we show that in this low - mass source the emission from these molecules is coincident with the shock at a1 .",
    "the abundances derived from the submillimeter emission indicate significant local enhancements over those expected for a low - mass protostar for many species , but especially those typically thought to trace shocks such as the sulphur - bearing molecules so and so@xmath8 .",
    "our results highlight the key role of shocks in explaining the nature of hot cores , and demonstrate the importance of high - resolution imaging at submillimeter wavelengths with the sma in pinning down rotation diagrams using high - energy transitions .",
    "finally , we discuss the possibility of using optically - thick dust emission from accretion disks as a background source against which to detect infall in the surrounding envelope .",
    "the advantage of using compact dust emission instead of the usual technique of using a molecular emission line as the background source is that the absorption must be on the physical size scale of the disk itself , and by choosing an appropriate molecular transition for the absorption it is possible to isolate the kinematics of infalling gas in the inner envelope , without confusion from other emission components such as outflow .",
    "when measured against the dust continuum any blueshifted absorption must be outflow , rotation will be at the systemic velocity , and redshifted absorption can be unambiguously identified as infall . by excluding short baselines from the sma data we detect redshifted absorption of so ( @xmath5@xmath0@xmath6 ) against source b extending 5  km  s@xmath2 from the systemic @xmath246 .",
    "unfortunately the signal - to - noise ratio is not sufficient to allow a detailed analysis of the infall kinematics of iras  16293@xmath02422 , but clearly this will be a possibility in the future .",
    "we thank alison peck and her colleagues at the sma for obtaining the submillimeter data .",
    "we also thank al wootten and mark claussen for useful discussions on the nature of iras  16293@xmath02422 , and the referee for constructive comments that have helped improve the paper . l.l .",

    "<S> the new sma data now separate source a into two submillimeter continuum components , which we denote aa and ab . the strongest of these , aa , peaks between the centimeter radio sources a1 and a2 , but the resolution of the current submillimeter data is insufficient to distinguish whether this is a separate source or the centroid of submillimeter dust emission associated with a1 and a2 . </S>",

    "<S> we also find , however , significant relative motion between the centimeter sources a1 and a2 which excludes the possibility that these two sources are gravitationally bound unless a1 is in a highly eccentric orbit and is observed at periastron , the probability of which is low . </S>",

    "<S> the origin of this jet must be located close to a2 , and may be the submillimeter continuum source aa . </S>",
    "<S> thus source a is now shown to comprise three ( proto)stellar components within @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> the species detected are typical of hot cores , the emission from which is mainly associated with source a. the abundances of second generation species , especially of sulphur - bearing molecules , are significantly higher than predicted by chemical models for this source to date , and we suggest that shocks are probably needed to explain these enhancements . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks in the integrated emission from molecules having high rotation temperatures coincide with the centimeter source a1 , also highlighting the key role of shocks in explaining the nature of hot cores . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the high brightness temperature of the submillimeter dust emission from source b to demonstrate the unambiguous detection of infall by observing redshifted so ( @xmath5@xmath0@xmath6 ) absorption against the emission from its dust disk . </S>"
