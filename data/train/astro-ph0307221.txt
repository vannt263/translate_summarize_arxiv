    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "twenty - six such molecules have been detected to date in interstellar clouds .",
    "the interest in this topic lies in the unusual chemistry at work in the cold regions where co is apparently strongly depleted @xcite and in the general question of how much deuterium is trapped in the cold , dense phase of the ism @xcite .",
    "+ the study of doubly deuterated interstellar molecules has been very active in the last few years , since the surprising discovery of a large amount ( @xmath3 5% ) of doubly deuterated formaldehyde ( d@xmath0co ) in the low mass protostar iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite . this is more than one order of magnitude higher than in orion kl , where d@xmath0co was first detected by @xcite .",
    "this first discovery was followed by many other studies which confirmed the presence of large amounts of d@xmath0co ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as doubly deuterated ammonia ( nd@xmath0h ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gas phase chemical models account relatively well for the observations of the abundances of singly deuterated molecules , but may not be able to completely reproduce the large deuterations observed for multiply deuterated molecules .",
    "the large deuterations could also be a product of active chemistry on the grain surfaces as predicted by @xcite : deuteration during the mantle formation phase followed by evaporation of the mantles ices resulting from the heating of the newly formed star , with injection into the gas phase of the deuterated species ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+ recently , the detection of a triply deuterated molecule ( nd@xmath4 ) extended the observational framework .",
    "until now , the possibility for detecting triply deuterated molecules seemed so remote that their lines were omitted in the spectroscopic catalogs for astrophysics .",
    "the ground - state rotational transition at 309.91 ghz of nd@xmath4 has been detected with the cso towards the barnard 1 cloud @xcite and the ngc 1333 iras 4a region @xcite , with abundance ratios [ nd@xmath4]/[nh@xmath4 ] @xmath3 10@xmath6 and [ nd@xmath4/h@xmath0 ] @xmath3 10@xmath8 .",
    "the process at work , chemical fractionation , takes place in cold gas where the deuterium substituted molecule is favored due to the lower vibrational uncertainty energy of the heavier molecule .",
    "the chemical process requires the presence of h@xmath1 which is usually limited by reactions with molecules such as co. however , in these cold ( @xmath3 10 k ) regions of the interstellar medium , molecules such as co accrete onto grain surfaces to form mantles , so allowing the gas phase process of deuterium fractionation to take place @xcite . in time",
    ", the material of the mantle will suffer its own low temperature deuterium fractionation @xcite .",
    "thus the grains may be important , both in enabling the gas phase process through depletion of reactive molecules and also by their own surface chemistry .",
    "for the latter to be effective , the deuterated molecules on the grain surface must be released , by some external energetic process , back into the gas phase , when they can be detected .",
    "the gas phase mechanism has recently received a boost from the recognition that inclusion of the more highly deuterated species d@xmath0h@xmath2 and d@xmath1 @xcite in the chemical calculations , increases at least by a factor of 2 the gas phase d / h ratio @xcite . + the identified most abundant components of the molecular mantles found on interstellar dust grains are h@xmath0o and co ( for references , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the large range of condensation temperatures ( see * ? ? ? * ) spanned by h@xmath0o ( t@xmath9 @xmath3 90  k ) and co ( t@xmath9 @xmath3 16  k ) suggests that molecules with intermediate condensation temperatures could also be present in the grain mantles .",
    "for example , h@xmath0s has a condensation temperature of @xmath3 39  k @xcite .",
    "this molecule and other sulfur - bearing molecules have been observed in the gas phase in cold , dark clouds where high - temperature processes should not be important @xcite : x(h@xmath0s ) = 3 @xmath10 10@xmath11 at the so peak of l134n , @xmath12 5 @xmath10 10@xmath13 at the cyanopolyyne peak towards tmc1 and @xmath3 7 @xmath10 10@xmath13 towards the nh@xmath4 peak position of tmc1 .",
    "these values can be compared to the range 10@xmath8  -  10@xmath13 obtained for steady - state gas - phase models @xcite .",
    "therefore , it poses a problem for gas phase chemistry .",
    "the gas - phase reactions proposed for the formation of h@xmath0s are endothermic ( see section 3 ) and other mechanisms such as shock chemistry or high temperature chemistry are unlikely to be important in dark clouds .",
    "grain surface reactions have then been suggested as an alternative pathway to h@xmath0s molecule formation @xcite .",
    "+ because sulfur is chemically similar to oxygen , it is tempting to study this molecule to gain insight to the h@xmath0o deuteration processes . like h@xmath0o ,",
    "it is possible that h@xmath0s originates on grain surfaces , where it was formed by accretion and hydrogenation of sulfur atoms during core formation @xcite .",
    "the comparison between h@xmath0s , hds and d@xmath0s would be useful for a complete study of the deuteration processes . in this letter , we report the observations of the hds and d@xmath0s ground transitions , accessible at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "this observatory is a 10.4 meter single - dish antenna located on top of mauna kea in hawaii . at 240 ghz",

    "+ the observation towards iras16293 - 2422 was made in position switching mode with the reference position located at @xmath20 = -180@xmath21 and @xmath22 = 0@xmath21 from the nominal center whose coordinates are quoted in table [ table1 ] .",

    "q(t@xmath32 ) is the partition function @xmath33 equal to 3.1 for hds ( 1@xmath15  -  0@xmath16 ) , and 21.6 for d@xmath0s ( 1@xmath18  -  0@xmath16 ) using an excitation temperature of 10 k. this temperature , taken as a kinetic temperature is that at which chemical fractionation should be efficient .",
    "the observed transitions are obviously not enough to calculate the excitation temperature in each source . nevertheless , it is possible to estimate a reliable value for the excitation temperature using the kinetic temperature of the gas found in the literature .",
    "@xcite ( respectively * ? ? ? * ) derived a kinetic temperature in l1689n ( respectively b1 ) of @xmath3 12 k based on their ammonia observations . @xcite estimated t@xmath34 between 20 and 40 k for the core of iras4a based on their cs and h@xmath0co observations .",
    "@xcite found that t@xmath34 lies in the range of 15 - 20 k for iras2 from their infall model .",
    "@xcite estimated a rotational temperature of @xmath3 12 k from two hds lines towards iras16293 .",
    "in the three last sources , the class 0 sources , temperature gradients are known to be present , and the quoted estimates refer to the outer regions of the envelopes of these sources . very likely the present hds and d@xmath0s observations probe in fact those external regions too . in the following",
    ", we will assume that t@xmath32 is the same for hds and d@xmath0s , namely that the 2 molecules originate in the same region .",
    "luckily enough , the calculation of the n(d@xmath0s)/n(hds ) ratio does not depend so much on the excitation temperature in the 10  -  50  k range , as the energy levels compared are similar .",
    "+ d@xmath0s has para and ortho forms . the observed 1@xmath18  -  0@xmath16 transition is the lowest line in the ortho ladder . to derive the d@xmath0s / hds ratio , the d@xmath0s column density was calculated for the ortho levels only , and then extrapolated to a total column density assuming an ortho to para ratio of 2 .",
    "the derived d@xmath0s / hds ratios have been computed using equations ( 1  -  3 ) and are reported in table [ table3 ] .",
    "hydrogen sulfide is traditionally believed to form on the grain surfaces , since gas phase reactions in cold gas are not efficient enough to account for the observed h@xmath0s abundances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in dense clouds sulfur",
    "is believed to be mostly neutral and initiates the chain reaction :      h@xmath4s@xmath2 is thought to be the precursor to the h@xmath0s molecule , via a dissociative recombination .",
    "the reaction is important because all the normal sh@xmath36@xmath2  +  h@xmath0  @xmath19  sh@xmath37@xmath2  +  h reactions are highly endothermic @xcite and can not occur in cold interstellar clouds .",
    "nevertheless , even at low temperatures , the rate coefficient of h@xmath4s@xmath2 production is very low ( @xmath3 4 @xmath10 10@xmath38 @xmath39s@xmath31 at 10 k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , limiting the production of h@xmath0s molecules in cold clouds . on the contrary , sulfur is expected to easily react with h on grain surfaces and thereby form the volatile hydride h@xmath0s @xcite . in the same vein , formaldehyde and methanol are believed to be formed via active grain chemistry with successive hydrogenations of co , stored on the grain mantles , and eventually released into the gas , for instance during the collapse phase , when the heating of newly formed protostars evaporates the co - rich ices .",
    "+ if the deuteration of the three ices ( h@xmath0s , h@xmath0co and ch@xmath4oh ) occurs when the ices are formed and if it is dominated by pure statistics ( i.e. by the random distribution of d atoms ) , the deuteration ratios would assume the following values ( detailed discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : f(h@xmath0s ) = ( hds / h@xmath0s)@xmath40/(d@xmath0s / h@xmath0s ) = 4 , f(h@xmath0co ) = ( hdco / h@xmath0co)@xmath40/(d@xmath0co / h@xmath0co ) = 4 , f(ch@xmath4oh ) = ( ch@xmath0doh / ch@xmath4oh)@xmath40/(chd@xmath0oh / ch@xmath4oh ) = 3 . observed values different from these would indicate either different chemical pathways or chemical reactions on the grain surfaces which favor d over h ( or vice - versa ) substitutions .",
    "note that the modified rate approach and monte carlo method by @xcite to explain deuteration fractionation on interstellar grains indeed confirm the above values -assuming that the chemistry of s is similar to that of o on the grain surfaces .",
    "+ our sample includes iras16293 - 2422 , where the singly and doubly deuterated forms of both formaldehyde and methanol have been observed @xcite .",
    "the observed values are : f(h@xmath0co ) = 0.4 and f(ch@xmath4oh ) = 4 . combining the present d@xmath0s / hds upper limit ( table [ table3 ] ) with the hds / h@xmath0s value found by (",
    "* hds / h@xmath0s@xmath41 ) gives : f(h@xmath0s ) @xmath42 0.5 .",
    "it seems hence that while methanol and hydrogen sulfide are consistent with the hypothesis of the random distribution of d s and formation on the grain surfaces , formaldehyde is definitively off .",
    "the use of the f factors has the great advantage to highlighting what chemical mechanism is responsible for the observed deuteration @xcite , but obviously overlooks the details of it .",
    "+ we computed in table [ table3 ] the column densities for the hds molecule . assuming that the hds / h@xmath0s is around 10% , the value found for formaldehyde and other molecules presenting a large degree of deuteration , one would obtain h@xmath0s abundances in the range ( 0.2  -  2 ) @xmath10 10@xmath11 . this value has been computed with an h@xmath0 column density about 2.8 @xmath10 10@xmath43 @xmath44 for l1689n(dco@xmath2 ) @xcite , 2 @xmath10 10@xmath43 @xmath44 for iras16293 @xcite , 1.3 @xmath10 10@xmath43 @xmath44 for b1 @xcite and 3.1 @xmath10 10@xmath43 @xmath44 for iras4a @xcite .",
    "we do nt know yet the actual value for the h@xmath0 column density towards iras4a(dco@xmath2 ) .",
    "we can say that the computed h@xmath0s abundance seems higher than the range of 10@xmath8  -  10@xmath13 estimated for steady - state gas - phase models @xcite , and it would be a strong evidence that grains , and not gas , are producing h@xmath0s . of course , this is a rough estimate , and observations for the h@xmath0s molecule have already been planned in order to derive more accurate values . + the diagonal line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the predicted d@xmath0s / hds as function of the atomic d / h ratio in the accreting gas , assuming that d@xmath0s / hds is equal to d@xmath0o / hdo , as computed by @xcite .",
    "the argument that the surface chemistries of sulfur and oxygen are similar can be challenged by the fact that d@xmath0o has not yet been detected in the interstellar medium .",
    "but the search for d@xmath0o has not yet been carried out towards the same objects where d@xmath0s has been detected , and it will be interesting indeed to check whether the two molecules , d@xmath0s and d@xmath0o , have very different abundances with respect to their respective main isotopomers . in the model presented by @xcite , surface chemistry can convert a high atomic d / h ratio in the gas to high abundance ratios for singly , doubly or triply deuterated isotopomers , especially at high gas densities ( 10@xmath45 cm@xmath6 ) and low temperatures ( 10 k ) .",
    "the observed values in b1 and ngc1333-iras4a(dco+ ) and upper limits of table [ table3 ] are consistent with previous determinations of the required atomic d / h ratio in the accreting gas of @xmath47  -  0.3 found in the case of iras16293 - 2422 @xcite .",
    "+ we conclude that , based on the observations so far available , hydrogen sulfide , formaldehyde and methanol are very likely formed on the grain surfaces , and the deuteration occurs during the formation of the mantles .",
    "what remained problematic to explain up to very recently is the relatively large value of the atomic d / h ratio required to achieve the observed large deuteration fractionation in the three molecules .",
    "in fact until very recently , no gas - phase chemical model predicted such large values of atomic d / h ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the current year has seen the detection of an extremely large abundance of h@xmath0d@xmath2 in the pre - stellar core l1544 @xcite , 10 times larger than prediction from previous chemical model .",
    "this detection , together with the previous observations of the doubly and triply deuterated molecules , has stimulated a radical revision of the chemical gas phase models .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the h@xmath1 chemistry should include d@xmath0h@xmath2 and d@xmath1 , as well as the expected h@xmath0d@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite showed that inclusion of the doubly and triply deuterated forms of h@xmath1 would increase the atomic d / h ratio in co depleted gas to the levels 0.1  -  1 , required by the d@xmath0co , chd@xmath0oh and the present d@xmath0s observations . in conclusion , this work supports the hypothesis that formaldehyde , methanol and hydrogen sulfide are indeed formed on the grain surfaces , during the cold pre - stellar core phase , where the co depleted gas possesses large atomic d / h ratios .",
