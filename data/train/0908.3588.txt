    "knowledge about the initial conditions of star formation is scarce : in a majority of the observable clouds , star formation has been active for relatively long periods of time , and the clouds have evolved from their early stages .",
    "examples of the few observable clouds that display little or no star formation activity and may be very young , are the maddalena cloud @xcite , lupus 5 @xcite , portions of the aquila rift @xcite and the pipe nebula .",
    "the latter , with a mass of @xmath1 m@xmath2 , is particularly interesting because it is one of the nearest clouds ( @xmath3 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that we can observe with a great level of detail . for these reasons the pipe has recently become a prime target for the study of the early stages of star formation .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter lal06 ) used the observations of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) to construct a complete extinction map of the cloud at a resolution of 60@xmath4 . using this map , @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter rla09 ) revealed and confirmed , respectively , that the pipe nebula hosts over 130 dense cores . according to those studies ,",
    "the mass spectrum of the pipe nebula cores appears to be very similar in shape to the standard initial mass function only scaled to higher mass by a factor of 3 .",

    "radio wavelength observations towards individual cores by @xcite and @xcite allowed them to produce measurements of kinematics , characteristic gas temperatures and gas pressure estimates for a large fraction of the cores .",

    "b59 is also one of only a few cores in the nebula with evidence for active star formation , and the only one forming a group of young stellar objects .",

    "currently available radio maps of b59 @xcite , also lack the resolution to resolve the internal structure of the core . with the goal of making a higher resolution , fully sampled extinction map , we combined spitzer observations that penetrate the very dense center of the core up to a maximum column density of @xmath7100 mag with near - infrared ( nir ) , high resolution observations obtained at 4 and 8 m class telescopes of the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",

    "we found that the resultant extinction law : 1 ) is approximately linear down to high levels of reddening , i.e. , does not change significantly with depth ; 2 ) departs ( flattens ) only moderately from the extinction law calculated with similar methods towards other less dense regions @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that we can reliably measure high dust column densities in b59 using a single extinction law .",

    "these sofi - ntt observations were performed at two different epochs : the first season ran during june 2001 , with 8 fields imaged in @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; the second season was held in june 2002 , with 9 fields imaged in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "these observations targeted the areas of highest extinction in the region , specifically the nucleus of the dense , star forming core ( 2 fields ) , and the westernmost core of the cloud ( core 03 in the list of ral09 , 1 field ) . the high resolution ( @xmath17 ) and sensitivity of these observations allowed us to detect a few more highly reddened sources that could not be detected with sofi .",

    "data reduction was carried out using a pipeline @xcite that combines iraf routines and eso publicly available routines to take care of particular aspects of the vlt and ntt data processing . a second pipeline @xcite combines the s - extractor algorithm @xcite with iraf routines to perform point spread function photometry on the crowded fields of the pipe nebula , projected against the galactic bulge",

    "the observations were carried out during october 2007 as a complementary project of the ammonia survey of dense cores across the pipe nebula by @xcite .",
    "the construction of the extinction map requires a catalog that combines the nir and mir sets .",
    "we joined the photometry catalogs from different observations in a progressive sequence : first , the photometry lists from single filter observations on each instrument were combined into single - field catalogs .",
    "second , the single - field catalogs were merged into single - instrument catalogs .",
    "third , we constructed a complete eso photometry list , by merging the isaac and sofi catalogs with a source matching algorithm that preferentially listed isaac over sofi detections .",
    "positional matching between ntt and vlt was calculated within a tolerance radius of 0.24@xmath4 , i.e. twice the average uncertainty of the eso - ntt astrometric solutions .",
    "the final eso catalog contained 59721 sources .",
    "fourth , the eso final list was merged to a 2mass `` bed '' catalog obtained from the all sky data release .",
    "the 2mass bed catalog covers a rectangular area from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , containing 14099 sources after separating those fainter than the listed sensitivity limits and those with photometric quality flags ` u ' and x , which indicate upper - limits and defective observations , respectively . in order to merge our eso catalog with the 2mass bed catalog ,",
    "we determined positional matches in the area within a tolerance radius of 0.36@xmath4 ( three times the average uncertainty of the eso - ntt astrometric solutions ) and rejected the 2mass matching sources except in a minority of cases when matching eso sources were saturated .",
    "the total number of sources in the eso+2mass catalog is 71216 .",
    "however , we limited our analysis only to those sources with photometric uncertainty smaller than 0.1 mag in at least one band and no infrared excess ( either from young source candidates in the cluster or field oh ir stars , abundant in the region , as shown by @xcite ) .",
    "our final nir working catalog contains a total of 55257 sources .        finally , we combined the nir and the mir data . in order to do this , we matched positions of sources in the eso-2mass catalog with those in the b59 stt c2d public catalog ( 5400 sources ) , using a positional tolerance of 0.36@xmath4 ; this way , we found a total of 3683 nir / mir counterparts with photometric uncertainty smaller than 0.1 mag in at least one band .",
    "however , during the construction of the extinction map , the eso-2mass - sst common area catalog was analyzed separately and merged only partially : we only used sst sources within an enclosed region where the density of eso sources drops dramatically as one reaches the center of the cloud . within",
    "this nir obscured region , we used a combination of hybrid nir+mir and pure mir colors for sources whose @xmath14 or @xmath15 detections were null or had unacceptable photometric quality ( see section [ section : analysis ] , below ) .",
    "we also rejected irac sources which had c2d flags indicating yso candidates , stars with dusty envelopes , and stars with flat , rising or cuspy spectral energy distributions ( sed ) .",
    "in addition , from the set of objects with available @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] photometry , we only kept those with brightness within 9.0 and 14 mag , and with colors @xmath23-[8.0]<0.5 $ ] mag , a restriction that helps to reject candidate class iii sources ( their intrinsic values are different from those of background giants ) and background galaxies .",
    "the technique used to construct our extinction map is a combination of the near infrared color excess ( nice ) method originally presented by @xcite and the revised method ( nicer ) of @xcite .",
    "the nicer algorithm requires a source to be observed in 3 bands -in our case @xmath16 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 in order to determine the extinction from two colors , otherwise it uses only two bands and one color , as in nice .",
    "we do not have eso @xmath16 band observations available for a majority of the eso fields ; particularly all fields covering the central region .",
    "therefore , for a majority of eso sources , extinction was determined from @xmath18 . also , when irac colors were added in the highest column density areas , we found it was more robust to use the color that was available for the largest number of sources possible at a given extinction ( see below ) , rather than choosing two fixed colors from a pool with variable uniformity , hence the use of nice ( i.e. extinction calculated from one color at a time ) for mir and hybrid nir+mir colors .",

    "this protocol is summarized in table [ tab : colors ] , where we listed the corresponding values of @xmath30 and the intrinsic values @xmath28 obtained from our control field .",
    "the complete extinction map , presented in figure [ fig : extmap : all ] was constructed using a gaussian spatial filter with fwhm=20@xmath4 , the beam width was increased to 24@xmath4 ( 20% oversampling ) in the @xmath50 mag region .",
    "the map is nyquist sampled , yielding pixels separated by 10@xmath4 .",
    "the value of extinction at each position is the gaussian weighted median of values for individual sources within a radius equal to 3-sigma of the gaussian beam .",
    "the error in the mean extinction , @xmath51 , was calculated as the standard deviation of individual background column density measurements , @xmath52 , divided by the square root of the number of sources ( @xmath53 ) within the 3-sigma circle .",

    "was used to smooth out contour jagging .",
    "the resultant map improves the resolution of the @xmath54 map of @xcite by a factor of three , allowing us to resolve for the first time : a ) the detailed structure of the central core , b ) the detailed structure of the thick filament located east of the central core ( hereafter _ eastern filament _ ) , c ) the structures of several , peripheral cores located to the southeast and west of the cloud , and d ) the faint filaments that connect the main core with the peripheral structures .    ,",
    "width=336 ]    the spatial resolutions of 20 and 24@xmath4 for this whole area map were chosen so that we could assure 1 ) that the average extinction per pixel could be calculated with at least two stars per pixel all the way to the peak of the central core ; 2 ) that the map reveals most of the features visible at a threshold resolution ( @xmath55 ) , at which a number of empty pixels start to appear .",
    "empty pixels would especially affect the central core region , where the number of nir sources starts to decrease significantly for @xmath56 .",
    "assuming that the quality of the photometry is uniform across the map , it is expected that the error in the measurement of extinction at a given line of sight i.e . the noise per pixel , will be inversely proportional to the number of sources involved . in figure",
    "[ fig : sigmaavp ] we show a plot of the error in the mean extinction , @xmath57 , as a function of @xmath34 . in general , at low ( @xmath58 mag ) and moderate ( 10@xmath5930 ) extinction levels , the error is low , @xmath60 mag , and also uniform , indicating that any structures within those levels are well resolved at the chosen resolution . above @xmath6130 mag ,",
    "@xmath57 increases monotonically until it reaches a maximum median value of about 1.5 mag per pixel within the most obscured regions in the central core ( @xmath6275 mag ) . at high extinction levels , the significance of features in the map is determined by this monotonic increase of the noise amplitude .",
    "for example , a 5@xmath57 interval in low to moderate extinction regions ( @xmath63 mag ) increases slowly from 0.55 to 1.5 mag , but has to be increased from 3.0 to 5.0 mag at the highest extinction levels ( @xmath64 mag ) .",
    "this indicates that any features in the map , especially peaks and valleys indicating the presence of dense gas cores , are only to be trusted if they can be measured as variations in extinction larger than the intervals just described .",
    "a dust extinction map is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) structure .",
    "potential dense cores can be identified as local maxima , forming extinction peaks that merge with the cloud at a local background level and have roughly elliptical shapes .",
    "the identification of individual cloud cores in a 2d map would be relatively straightforward if the extinction peaks were always well separated from each other . in practice , neighboring peaks may be seen in projection close to each other and in some cases overlap , making it difficult to determine their boundaries at the local background level . in order to reduce this effect , we reduced the contribution of the local background by applying a wavelet transform filter to the map using a routine developed by benoit vandame ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the routine is based on a multi - scale vision model ( mvm ) , designed to reconstruct astronomical images @xcite .",
    "the mvm filtering is performed by isolating features rising above a 4.0@xmath65 threshold in the wavelet transform space at five spatial scales : 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.6 , 3.2 and 6.4@xmath66 . at each scale , the pixels with values higher than the threshold in the wavelet transform space are identified and labeled , and the program constructs a series of trees of interscale connectivity , which are then used to identify significant objects and to reconstruct the image .",
    "the resultant mvm filtered image contains zero or minimum background , making it easier to define the boundaries of individual clumps .",
    "a simple check was done by subtracting the filtered image from the original map : the resultant residual image contains only background extinction and low level extinction from a few filamentary structures , mostly located east of the central core ( see figure [ fig : residuals ] ) .",
    "identification of individual clumps in 2d maps ( dust extinction and dust emission maps are common examples ) is usually done by means of a clump finding algorithm .",
    "2d maps lack information on the velocity distribution of the gas at each line of sight , making it difficult to separate clumps if they overlap . fortunately",
    ", the case of the pipe is particularly benign because the cloud is projected across its longest axis on the plane of the sky .",
    "most clump finding algorithms depend on a set of parameters to success at detecting peaks and to define the boundaries of individual features , and thus their reliability is ultimately subject to the correct choice of those parameters .",
    "we used the ` clumpfind-2d ` algorithm @xcite , because it has only one free parameter , the set of contour levels used to identify adjacent regions associated with a local peak or maxima .",
    "the intervals used to define the contour levels are defined by the user and have to be chosen carefully in order to select only significant structure and avoid identification of spurious features @xcite .",
    "moreover , as discussed in @xmath13[section : identification : subsection : significant : subsection : significance ] , additional criteria are required to determine the significance of individual detections .    to define the best set of contour levels , we considered the increase of the noise amplitude as a function of extinction in our map .",
    "we chose intervals starting at @xmath670.55 mag contour level , equal to 5 times the average noise per pixel in low extinction ( @xmath68 mag ) regions .",
    "for low and moderate extinction levels ( 1@xmath69 and @xmath70 ) we used fixed 5@xmath57 intervals set to 0.55 and 1.25 mag respectively . for thicker regions we calculated the 5@xmath57 interval corresponding to the increase in the noise as shown in figure [ fig : sigmaavp ] , until reaching @xmath34=73 mag . in a first run , we kept a list of all cores detected with the chosen set , then we decreased the level values by 1 and 2 sigmas ( test level dropping ) in order to discard spurious detections .",
    "a few features were no longer identified after the level dropping and were considered as spurious detection .",
    "also , we increased the minimum number of pixels for region identification from 20 to 50 , to avoid confounding single pixel fluctuations with extinction peaks .",
    "our final ` clumpfind-2d ` run yield 20 significant extinction peaks in the map , as shown in figure [ fig : identification ] .",
    "a list of these peak identifications is presented in table [ tab : clf2d ] .",

    "the core list of rla09 for the same region contains only 7 cores , resulting of merging some of the individual features they identified in the map of lal06 .",
    "the merging of features in rla09 was done by following a well defined prescription : a feature is significant if its peak rises by at least 3@xmath65 above the noise , and two features represent independent cloud cores only if their separation is larger than the mean jeans length of the cloud ( approximately 0.26 pc ) _ or _ if their central velocities ( measured from c@xmath82o observations ) differ by more than the 1-d isothermal sound speed at @xmath83 k.    .",

    "therefore , many of the features in our map may not be independent cores but they may represent significant _ substructure _ within larger , independent cores .",
    "our high resolution extinction map allows us to measure improved masses and sizes of features identified with ` clumpfind-2d ` and therefore provides improved measurements of the _ local _ jeans length ( ljl ) in the region , that we can then compare to the peak to peak projected separations of features which are also slightly better defined in our map . in what follows",

    "however , in section [ section : discussion : subsection : centralcorefrag : nosubstructure ] we argue that the split near the center might not be as physically significant as ` clumpfind-2d ` suggests , and that the central core is likely a single stratified core with only one independent new fragment ( 09c ) identified in this high resolution map .",
    "four cores are located in the periphery of the complex , corresponding to cores 3 , 4 , 5 and 13 in the list of rla09 .",
    "these objects have a morphology reminiscent of bok globules , but in our map , they appear to be still connected to the rest of the cloud region by thin ( @xmath94 mag ) filaments .",

    "core 05 has a peak extinction of 10.9 mag in the filtered map and has a toroidal like structure , similar to globule 2 in the coalsack cloud @xcite , which ` clumpfind-2d ` picks as a double core .",
    "we merged the two fragments , 05a and 05b because their projected separation is shorter than their ljl . in the case of peaks 04a and 04b , their morphology in the map and optical images might suggest they are independent , but as their projected separation ( 0.10 pc ) is about half their ljl ( @xmath950.2 pc ) , we can not tell if they are independent .",
    "thus , we merged features 04a and 04b into a single core , 04ab .",
    "there are two highly elongated clumps at the northwestern edge of the b59 region , both significantly larger in the e - w direction than in the n - s direction . `",
    "clumpfind-2d ` suggests these cores are each divided in two fragments ( cores 09d , e and 07a , b ) .",
    "the peak - to - peak projected distance from 09d to 07a is about 270@xmath4 or 0.17 pc , similar to the ljl of both cores , thus we confirm that peaks 09 and 07 are independent .    in the case of peaks 07a and 07b we find that the projected distance ( 0.06 pc ) is shorter than the ljl , thus we merged into a single core , 07 .",

    "however it is not clear whether the split might represent the existence of independent cores : the split at the @xmath34=72 mag level is significant above the local noise amplitude , but as we move away from this central region towards lower column density values , we can not find any other evidence of significant substructure .",
    "the total extinction above the second highest contour level at @xmath34=66 , is 2422 mag , distributed over 33 pixels , and yielding a mass of approximately 2.1 @xmath99 that is , if we include the column density in those pixels all the way to @xmath34=1 mag .",
    "however , if we count the extinction using a baseline level of @xmath34=66 mag , the two peaks at @xmath34=73 would represent two relatively small fluctuations above a smooth overall density gradient in a single stratified massive core . in such case",

    ", the only other possibility for the two fragments to represent independent cores would be that they are separated in velocity by more than the local sound speed .",
    "a high resolution c@xmath82o(2 - 1 ) map of the central region in b59 , recently obtained at the iram 30 m telescope ( romn - ziga et al .",
    ", in preparation ) allowed us to determine that the central velocities at the two peaks barely differ .",
    "our nh@xmath0 single point measurements also do not show significant variations of the central velocities near the two peaks .",
    "thus , given our current definitions , the two peaks at the nucleus of b59 would be considered to be part of the same core .",
    "moreover , the dust column density distribution is in fact consistent with a single , centrally condensed , stratified core with two small fluctuations near the top .",
    "it is significant that the depression in between the two peaks roughly coincides with the location of the protostellar source no .",

    "to test the idea that the central core could be a single , centrally condensed , quasi - isothermal structure , we compared the radial profile of the 09ab region with an analytical king density profile model @xcite of the form @xmath100^{-1}$ ] , as shown in figure [ fig : rpk2 ] .",
    "the fit is done in the @xmath34 vs. radius space with units mag and au , respectively .",

    "the agreement of the model with our data is thus acceptable , with only the two centermost points deviating significantly from the fit , showing a depression .",
    "this depression near the center of the core , accounts for only a 4% difference in mass with respect to the area under the model profile .",
    "the agreement of the data points with the king model reinforces the idea that the core could be a single , centrally condensed , nearly isothermal structure . at this point",
    ", we did not want to compare the profile of b59 with a bonnor - ebert sphere model as in @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that preliminary analysis yield a fit with a very large @xmath105 , indicative of a highly condensed object far from stable equilibrium , and as shown by @xcite , it is complicated to distinguish a bonnor - ebert sphere in unstable equilibrium from an object in stage of collapse .",
    "such discussion has important consequences , but they fall a bit far from the scope of this study . in a companion paper ( romn - ziga et al .",

    "we used our nh@xmath0 emission measurements to obtain information about the kinematic and thermal properties of the dense gas in the center of b59 .",
    "as expected for a high density core , the nh@xmath0 emission was found to be relatively intense for most of the pointed observations .",
    "the gbt was pointed towards a total of 37 positions across the central core ; 26 of these pointed observations yield significant emission in both the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions , while the 11 remaining pointings were rejected for having a low signal - to - noise ratio in either the ( 2,2 ) or the ( 1,1 ) transition .",
    "the 26 final pointings allowed to determine velocity dispersions , @xmath106 , and kinetic temperatures , @xmath107 , across the central part of the core via a forward - fitting routine ( for details on the data reduction and model fit methods , please see @xcite ) .",
    "the kinetic temperatures range from 10 to 13 k , with a mean of 11.3@xmath108 , and the velocity dispersions , @xmath106 varied from 0.13 to 0.29 with a mean of 0.18@xmath980.05 .    from these measurements we were able to estimate the isothermal sound speed , @xmath109 and the non - thermal velocity dispersion , @xmath110 .",

    "errors were estimated as follows : in the case of @xmath113 we took into consideration the uncertainties of the forward fitting routine for @xmath112 and @xmath114 ; in the case of @xmath34 we considered both the value of the median noise at the value of the pixel closest to each and the mean absolute deviation of the @xmath34 values in the 9 surrounding pixels to account for the uncertainty due to the differences in beam sizes ( gbt:30@xmath4 vs. nicer map:24@xmath4 ) .",

    "[ fig : rav],title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    it is certainly striking that a majority of the values are greater than @xmath113=1 , indicating that thermal motions dominate over non - thermal ( turbulent ) motions of the gas in the central core .",
    "the mean of @xmath113 in b59 is 1.90@xmath980.99 ; for comparison , a thermally dominated core like fest-1457 ( which also belongs to the pipe nebula ) , was shown to have an average ratio of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the plot of figure [ fig : rav ] also shows that the 12 lowest values of @xmath113 with a mean of @xmath116 are at the densest part of the core ( @xmath1171.5 mag ) .",
    "this suggests that non - thermal motions make a more significant contribution to the internal pressure at the central part of the core , where the column density is higher .",
    "the relatively large @xmath113 ratios in b59 tell us that the central core is still thermally dominated despite the presence of 14 cluster members packed in the same observed region .",
    "moreover , most of the non - thermal velocity dispersion values in b59 are smaller than the corresponding isothermal sound speed , suggesting that this cluster forming core is characterized by sub - sonic turbulent motions .",
    "our observations appear to indicate that a ) there is a lack of significant sub - structure in the central region of b59 and b ) that the central core is mostly quiescent , and still thermally dominated .",
    "the result is somewhat unanticipated , as we expected to find evidence of multiple fragmentation in a core with @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , the significant sub - structure we do detect in the central core of the b59 system appears to be related to the embedded protostars , while the overall radial profile of the core seems to be consistent with one large , isothermal structure .",
    "therefore , the question that arises is : what prevents b59 from fragmenting and collapsing into new stars after a period considerably larger than its own dynamical timescale ?",
    "in one theoretical scenario , a first generation of stars is formed , and they provide feedback which would contribute to suppress fragmentation in the remaining gas , allowing for accretion of material to form a more massive central object@xcite .",
    "recent observations show that the addition of significant non - thermal motions could prevent fragmentation and allow for the aggregation of larger amounts of material that could later collapse into a massive star @xcite .",
    "as we discussed before , our map shows three possible signatures of stellar feedback in b59 : the first is the large northwestern cavity being created by source no .",
    "11 , which might have triggered the formation of core 09c ; the second is the other cavity - like indentation at the southeast edge of the central core , possibly associated with source no .",
    "9 ; the third is the depression at the center of the core , associated with source no . 10",
    "however , we can not detect significant non - thermal motions produced by the stellar feedback in the linewidths of the radio observations .",
    "therefore , additional non - thermal support from some other process might be required .",
    "one possibility is that additional support against collapse could be provided by a mechanism of ambipolar diffusion via a strong magnetic field .",
    "@xcite showed that massive molecular cores tend to have larger column densities than expected from pure thermal support , but also that in some cases the non - thermal linewidths are smaller than expected ( as in b59 ) , in which case , support from a strong magnetic field would be required .",
    "the hypothesis of a strong magnetic field acting in the pipe nebula has been supported by numerical simulations @xcite , which show that ambipolar diffusion is an agent capable of slowing down the process of condensation , as needed in the pipe , where the free - fall time scale is very short given the median core density .",
    "a magnetic field could provide the necessary non - thermal support against collapse in massive cores like b59 , giving enough time for turbulence to decay and allowing the existence of quiescent condensations with moderate supersonic motions , similar to what we observe .",
    "a recent r - band optical polarimetry study of the pipe by @xcite suggested that the mass to magnetic flux ratio toward b59 is about 1.4 ( slightly supercritical ) , with a field strength 2 to 3 times weaker than other parts of the cloud .",
    "however , note that most of the stars available for optical polarimetry in b59 are located in regions of low column density at the edge of the core , and thus a more reliable tracer of the field towards the core could still improve these estimations .      in the rla09 analysis of the 2mass extinction map ,",
    "the eastern filament in b59 was considered to be one large core because their measurement of the length and separation of the fragments detected by ` clumpfind-2d ` did not comply with the requirements of being separated by more than a jeans length and by more than 0.12 km / s in central velocity .",
    "our high resolution map allows us to revisit the first requirement with a better quality dataset .    , width=336 ]    in figure [ fig : filpos ] we show the positions of sources in the area of the filament with reliable quality for application of the near - ir color excess method , from the 2mass catalog and the eso - ntt survey observations .",
    "the difference in the density of sources is remarkable , but not as much as the fact that the central region along the filament is almost void of sources in 2mass .",
    "this means that lal06 were probably not able to resolve the central part of the filament . instead , with the eso - ntt data we are sampling extinction all the way to the middle region .",
    "while the 2mass map and the eso - ntt map agree in the basic morphology , extension and basic structure of the core , the 2mass map can not be used to determine the presence of substructure : @xcite showed ( specifically for a cylindrical cloud ) , that a poor sampling of the background population in a highly obscured region due to a limited photometric , depth can lead to the creation of spurious sub - structure , or at least to an unreliable determination of the size and mass of substructures . in that sense ,",
    "our hybrid map resolves the filament along its axis and allows for the recognition of significant substructure .",
    "our analysis of the filament with ` clumpfind-2d ` reveals a total of 6 extinction peaks along the filament , and that these peaks are significant with our choice of 5 sigma contour steps .",
    "however , we must proceed with caution : again , it not trivial to claim that each one of these peaks should be considered a new core .",
    "the rla09 prescription requires individual cores to be separated in both distance and velocity . in their analysis , rla09 also detected substructure along the filament , but they decided to merge all peaks into a single , large core as the adjacent peaks in the map of lal06 did not show a separation in central velocity .",
    "however , we need to consider that while the prescription of rathborne is useful to determine the independence of two adjacent cores , it might not be ideal for a chain of related cores like in this filament .",
    "we suggest that the filament might be in a process of thermal fragmentation : we do not have pointed radio measurements at the peaks in the high resolution map , but we can revise the condition of the projected distance between the peaks along the filament with our improved measurements of the ljl : the small projected separation between peaks 11b and 11c is smaller than the ljl , suggesting that they might represent a single fragment , and thus we merged them in the final list of cores .",
    "our peak to peak measured distances for the remaining features average 0.11@xmath980.3 pc , just shorter the local jeans length estimated for the individual peaks , which varies from 0.12 to 0.16 pc .",
    "we have to consider , however , that projection effects over such a long structure may not be small and thus our measured projected distances are lower limits .",
    "also , the resultant jeans mass values , @xmath119 for the peaks along the filament average to 1.3@xmath980.2 m@xmath2 , and the ratio @xmath120 has an average of 1.2@xmath980.1 , indicating that the peaks along the filament are jeans stable .",
    "moreover , we measured the projected width of the filament directly on the map at seven different points along the eastern filament .",
    "the average width is 0.10@xmath980.02 pc , that compares well with the average ljl across the filament .",
    "these measurements suggest that the eastern filament in b59 could be following a process of thermal fragmentation , and could break into several fragments .",
    "the fragmentation of isothermal , cylindrical clouds has been studied often : observations by @xcite suggested that in a majority of observable filaments in molecular clouds , it was possible to observe a periodicity in the separations of peaks along filaments , and that in many cases these fragments agreed spatially with the locations of young sources , suggesting that peaks observed along filaments are the precursors of independent cores .",
    "recent observations have shown significant evidence of thermal fragmentation of filamentary clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "filamentary structures may become unstable and collapse via thermal fragmentation once they lose equilibrium with external pressure .",
    "@xcite found that a finite cylinder would collapse once its mass per unit length , @xmath121 surpasses a critical value , @xmath122 .",
    "numerical two - dimensional simulations by @xcite allow one to make a rough estimation of the jeans number , @xmath123 , in a finite isothermal cylinder of length @xmath124 and diameter @xmath125 as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is a geometrical factor . following @xcite calculations , for a ratio @xmath128 as observed in our map , the value of @xmath127 from bastien tables is close to 1.6 , the @xmath129 ratio is about 0.3 , and the critical jeans number is @xmath130=0.6 , so that @xmath131 .",

    "our deep observations allowed us to make a detailed map of dust extinction towards the b59 region with unprecedented spatial resolution ( 12 to 24@xmath4 ) and dynamic range of column density ( @xmath133 mag or @xmath134 ) .",
    "our extinction map allowed us to determine , in detail , the structure of the central core as well as of the filaments and peripheral cores in the barnard 59 complex .",
    "we found a total of 13 independent extinction peaks in the region , most of them interconnected by a complex structure of filaments .",
    "the largest filament is characterized by a high column density , with a peak extinction above @xmath34=22 mag .",
    "it appears to contain five independent cores evenly spaced along its axis .",
    "the total mass of the complex is approximately 41 @xmath99 , with half of this mass ( about 21 m@xmath2 ) being contained in the central region ( comprising cores 09ab and 09c ) , which is associated with the formation of the stellar cluster .",
    "the central core appears to have remarkably little structure despite the fact that its mass is significantly larger than either the bonnor - ebert or the jeans mass in the region .",
    "the split of the central core into two peaks is significant , but the small projected separation of the peaks and the negligible difference in central velocities does not support the idea that these peaks represent two independent cores . alternatively , the peaks could be related to the presence of a class 0/i source which is located between them .",
    "this source may have created a depression in what otherwise would be a large stratified core with a @xmath135 density distribution .",
    "the apparent separation of a fragment at the northwestern edge of the central core also appears to be significant , but it is at the edge of an outflow cavity and could be the result of the disruption of the core material by the stellar outflow .",
    "our map also suggests that a second cavity is located near source no .",
    "9 . apparently , most of the observed substructure in b59 could be the result of action by embedded ysos , indicating that stellar feedback is playing role of significance in the evolution of the core .",
    "\\7 . pointed observations of the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) rotational transitions of nh@xmath0 at 26 positions in the central core show that it is thermally dominated , with non - thermal motions being mostly subsonic .",
    "the central core has formed a small cluster of stars , but presently it is mostly quiescent and does not show any kinematic evidence of global collapse .",
    "it is possible that the feedback from the recently formed stars may be preventing the global collapse and suppressing further fragmentation .",
    "however , the absence of a significant non - thermal component in the observed radio lines suggests that an additional source of non - thermal support is required .",
    "we thank jill rathborne for providing the reduction and model fit of the nh@xmath0 data as part of a gbt survey of dense cores in the pipe nebula .",
    "we thank august muench , kevin covey , doug johnstone and paula teixeira for useful discussions and suggestions .",

    "<S> we present our analysis of a fully sampled , high resolution dust extinction map of the barnard 59 complex in the pipe nebula . the map was constructed with the infrared color excess technique applied to a photometric catalog that combines data from both ground and space based observations . </S>",
    "<S> the map resolves for the first time the high density center of the main core in the complex , that is associated with the formation of a small cluster of stars . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the central core in barnard 59 shows an unexpected lack of significant substructure consisting of only two significant fragments . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the material appears to be consistent with being a single , large core with a density profile that can be well fit by a king model . </S>",
    "<S> a series of nh@xmath0 pointed observations towards the high column density center of the core appear to show that the core is still thermally dominated , with sub - sonic non - thermal motions . </S>",
    "<S> the stars in the cluster could be providing feedback to support the core against collapse , but the relatively narrow radio lines suggest that an additional source of support , for example a magnetic field , may be required to stabilize the core . outside the central core </S>",
    "<S> our observations reveal the structure of peripheral cores and resolve an extended filament into a handful of significant substructures whose spacing and masses appear to be consistent with jeans fragmentation . </S>"
