    "millisecond radio pulsars are thought to be created in neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . in those lmxbs , accreting matter may spin - up the neutron star ( see , e.g. , bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that millisecond pulsars should also be found in lmxbs during the accretion phase of the binary as x - ray pulsars .",
    "although evidence for rapidly spinning neutron stars in lmxbs was inferred from the burst oscillations which were seen during type - i x - ray bursts in several systems ( see strohmayer 2001 for a review ) , the detection of millisecond pulsations in persistent emission remained elusive for many years . in 1998 , the first such system was discovered ( sax j1808.43658 , which has a spin frequency of 401 hz ; wijnands & van der klis 1998a ) .",
    "this source was extensively studied due to its obvious importance for binary evolution scenarios and accretion flow geometries and dynamics ( see , e.g. , wijnands & van der klis 1998b and references therein ) .    in the spring of 2002 ,",
    "markwardt & swank ( 2002a ) reported the discovery of the second accretion - driven millisecond pulsar xte j1751305 ( 435 hz ) in the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) bulge scan observation program .",
    "about one month after the discovery of this system , xte j0929314 was discovered ( 185 hz ; remillard , swank , & strohmayer 2002 . ) .",
    "the neutron stars in both systems are in orbit around a companion star , with an orbital period of @xmath342 minutes ( markwardt & swank 2002b ; galloway et al .",
    "these systems are very tight binaries and the inferred mass of their companion stars is very low ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "after the discovery of xte j1751305 , we submitted a target - of - opportunity request to _ xmm - newton _ for the purpose of studying this source with high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the first system  sax j1808.43658  could only be studied during outburst using _ rxte _ and with the wide field cameras aboard__bepposax _ _ , which have only moderate spectral resolution . in this _",
    "letter _ , we present an analysis of the time - averaged epic - pn and reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) data .",
    "the spectra obtained represent the first ccd- and gratings - resolution measurements from a millisecond x - ray pulsar in outburst .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observed xte  j1751@xmath5305 beginning on 2002 april 07.5 ( ut ) .",
    "the epic - pn camera was operated in `` timing '' mode to prevent photon pile - up effects and to allow pulse - phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "the rgs was operated in the standard `` spectroscopy '' mode .",
    "the `` thin '' optical blocking filter was selected for the epic cameras .",
    "the epic - mos cameras were not operated in modes optimized for a source of this intensity , and we do not consider the mos spectra here .",
    "the epic - pn and rgs data were reduced using sas version 5.3 .",
    "we applied the standard reduction procedure `` epproc '' to produce a calibrated pn event list . in `` timing '' mode , the spatial information is compressed into one dimension .",
    "we extracted source data in a rectangle ( with a width of 37  ) along the length of the ccd , and background data from adjacent regions ; only `` single '' and `` double '' events were selected .",
    "the net pn exposure was 33.7  ks .",
    "using lheasoft version 5.1 , the tool `` grppha '' was used to rebin the spectrum to require a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "we used the trial `` timing '' mode redistribution and ancillary response functions developed by the epic - pn calibration team .",
    "we applied the standard reduction procedure `` rgsproc '' to produce calibrated rgs event lists , first - order spectra , and response functions .",
    "periods of high instrumental background were excluded , giving a net rgs exposure of 34.2  ks .",
    "the rgs spectra were grouped to require at least 20 counts per bin .",
    "preliminary spectroscopic results from this _ xmm - newton _ observation were reported in miller et al .",
    "2002a and miller et al . 2002b .",
    "the accurate position of xte j1751305 was reported by ehle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , also based on analysis of this observation ( @xmath6 , equinox 2000.0 ) .",
    "the internal calibration accuracy of the epic cameras is better than 5% for on - axis sources ( kirsch 2002 ) .",
    "we find deviations up to 0.6  kev which are not removed by spectral modeling , and therefore restrict our analysis of the pn spectrum to the 0.610.0  kev band .",
    "the average count rate ( 79.36 counts  @xmath7 ) is well below that at which photon pile - up occurs in timing mode ( 1500 counts  @xmath8 ) .",
    "tests of the effective area calibration of the rgs reveal accuracies of 5% in the 736   ( 0.351.77  kev ) range and 10% at wavelengths",
    "shorter than 7   ( energies above 1.77  kev ; den herder 2002 ) .",
    "although our best - fit model for the epic - pn spectrum ( see below ) provides an adequate fit to the rgs spectrum ( @xmath9 ) , broad deviations are apparent at energies above 1.8  kev .",
    "we therefore rely on the epic - pn spectrum to characterize the continuum emission , and search the rgs band in contiguous 3   slices for narrow features .",
    "the epic - pn and rgs spectra were analyzed using xspec version 11.1 .",
    "all errors quoted in this paper are 90% confidence errors .",
    "note that systematic errors are not added to the spectra to account for flux calibration uncertainties .",
    "we first considered a model consisting of blackbody and power - law components , modified by neutral absorption in the ism ( using the `` phabs '' model in xspec ) .",
    "we measure a best - fit equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath10 .",
    "the blackbody temperature obtained is moderate : @xmath11  kev .",
    "for spherical symmetry , this translates into a blackbody radius of @xmath12 , where the spectral hardening factor @xmath13 is the ratio of the color temperature and the effective temperature , and @xmath14 is the distance to the source .",
    "the measured power - law index is @xmath15 ; the normalization is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 at 1 kev ) .",
    "this model produces an adequate fit to the data : @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the number of degrees of freedom ; @xmath20 for this model ; see figure 1 ) .",
    "we note that a simple power - law model returns a very poor fit ( @xmath21 ) ; the soft blackbody component is strongly required by the data .    with this simple but standard model ,",
    "we obtain an unabsorbed 0.510.0  kev flux of @xmath22 , or @xmath23 .",
    "the hard power - law component contributes 83% of the unabsorbed flux       in the 0.510.0  kev band ( an extrapolation from the 0.610.0  kev band as the 0.510.0  kev range is more conventional )",
    ".    motivated by evidence for a comptonizing volume in sax  j1808.43658 ( gierlinski , done , & barret 2002 ) , we also fit the epic - pn spectrum with the `` comptt '' comptonization model ( titarchuk 1994 ) , which attempts to account for the compton - upscattering of cool photons in a hot corona self - consistently .",
    "this model does not provide an acceptable fit by itself ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we find a degeneracy between a cool corona ( @xmath25  kev ) with high optical depth ( @xmath26 ) , and a hot corona ( @xmath27  kev ) with lower optical depth ( @xmath28 ) , each up - scattering a seed photon distribution peaking between @xmath290.50.6  kev . finally , we tried fitting a blackbody component in addition to comptt .",
    "this model might correspond to a scenario in which the blackbody emission region is only partially covered by the corona .",
    "this model also yielded a poor fit ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the strength , ionization state , and profile of fe  k@xmath31 emission lines  if produced through irradiation of the accretion disk  can reveal a great deal about the accretion geometry of low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "asai et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report the possible detection of an fe  k@xmath31 line in 4u 182030 ( p@xmath32  minutes ; stella , white , & priedhorsky 1987 ) . the line was found to be ionized ( e @xmath33  kev ) , broad ( fwhm @xmath34  kev ) , and weak ( @xmath35  ev ) .",
    "assuming a line of equivalent fwhm in the 6.406.97  kev range ( fe  i  fe  xxvi ) , we measure a 95% confidence upper - limit of just 6  ev in the epic - pn spectrum of xte j1751305 . using a gaussian with zero width to model a line narrower than the epic - pn resolution ,",
    "the 95% confidence upper limit on the equivalent width of any such narrow fe  k@xmath31 lines is less than 4  ev ( 6.406.97  kev ) .",
    "we applied the sas task `` barycen '' , and using the binary system parameters reported by markwardt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we produced spectra from the `` high '' and `` low '' parts of the pulse .",
    "we find that the model applied to the time - averaged spectrum is an acceptable description of these spectra ( no convincing narrow or broad emission or absorption features are found ) .",
    "interestingly , the slope of the power - law component is consistent in the two spectra but the normalization changes , and the blackbody component changes in temperature but not in normalization .",
    "similar behavior was discovered in pulse - phase - resolved spectra of sax j1808.4@xmath53658 ( gierlinski , done , & barret 2002 ) .",
    "we note that a possible feature at approximately 2.9  kev appears to vary in width , intensity , and centroid energy in the `` high '' and `` low '' spectra ; however , the error limits on the line parameters overlap .",
    "this feature is also visible in the time - averaged spectrum ( see figure 1 ) . as there are no astrophysically abundant elements with transitions near this energy , it is tempting to associate this feature with a red - shifted absorption line from the neutron star surface ( given the temperature of the blackbody , perhaps fe  xxv or fe  xxvi ) .",
    "although an f - test finds that the addition of a gaussian to model this feature is significant at the 7@xmath36 level of confidence in the `` low '' part of the pulse ( 3@xmath36 in the `` high '' part ) , a similar feature is apparent when the epic - pn spectrum of the galactic black hole candidate xte  j1650@xmath5500 ( miller et al .",
    "2002c ) is fit using the same response matrix .",
    "it is likely that this feature is due to a defect in the timing - mode response matrix .",
    "we analyzed the rgs spectra in contiguous 3   slices for narrow emission or absorption lines . in each 3   slice , a simple power - law plus ism edge(s ) model was fit to the data .",
    "we find no convincing evidence for narrow absorption features in this band ( 0.32.5  kev , or 540 ) . at energies below @xmath30.6  kev ( wavelengths",
    "longer than @xmath321 ) the sensitivity is low due to the relatively high column density along the line of sight to xte j1751305 .",
    "recently , evidence for enhanced ne abundances has been found in compact binaries ( schulz et al .",
    "2001 ; juett , psaltis , & chakrabarty 2001 ) .",
    "we fit the rgs spectra around the position of the ne k edge ( 14.25  ) with a power - law model between 13.25   and 15.25(see figure 2 ) .",
    "the power - law index and normalization were both allowed to vary in this fit . using the cross - sections of verner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and solar abundances relative to h as per morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) , we find that ne may be _",
    "under_-abundant in xte j1751305 :       the 95% confidence upper - limit is that the abundance of ne is only 77% of the solar value .",
    "a solar ne abundance does not allow for an optimal characterization of the local spectrum ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the binary x - ray pulsar 4u 162667 also has a 42-minute orbital period .",
    "moreover , the distance to this system may be close to 8  kpc ( chakrabarty 1998 ) ; we anticipate a galactic center location for xte  j1751@xmath5305 and therefore a similar distance .",
    "a _ chandra_/hetgs spectrum of 4u  1626@xmath567 reveals broadened emission lines and doppler - shifted line pairs ( schulz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the ne ly-@xmath31 line ( 12.13 ) is particularly strong ( a flux of @xmath37 is measured ; fwhm @xmath38 ) .",
    "we report the 95% confidence upper - limits on emission lines from helium - like and hydrogenic ne , mg , and si in table 1 ( upper limits on o emission lines are not constraining due to poor statistics at low energies ) .",
    "we have analyzed the first ccd- and grating - resolution x - ray spectra of a millisecond x - ray pulsar in outburst .",
    "we find no convincing evidence for broad or narrow emission or absorption features in the the epic - pn and rgs spectra ( see figure 1 and table 1 ) . with our simple blackbody plus power - law model for the epic - pn spectrum , we find that the power - law component comprises 83% of the unabsorbed flux in the 0.510.0  kev band .",
    "the power - law component is hard : @xmath1 , but within a range typical for x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , @xmath39 1.01.5 ; white , swank , & holt 1983 ) .",
    "the epic - pn spectrum requires a blackbody with @xmath2  kev and an implied emitting radius of @xmath40  km .",
    "it is fair to say that our knowledge of the spectral hardening factor @xmath13 is rather poor ( for a discussion , see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ) . if @xmath13 is less than 1.3 , it would indicate that only part of the neutron star surface ( a `` hot spot '' ) is involved .",
    "markwardt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) fit a simple absorbed power - law model to the _ rxte _ spectrum of xte  j1751305 , and measure a softer power - law index ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the effective lower sensitivity bound of the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ) is 3 kev ; fitting the 310  kev epic - pn spectrum with only a power - law , we find @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 allowing @xmath45 to float ( in this case , @xmath46 \\times 10^{22}~ { \\rm atoms}~{\\rm cm}^{-2}$ ] ) .",
    "thus , the discrepant indices are easily explained in terms of different instrumental ranges .    in modeling simultaneous _ chandra_/letgs and _ rxte _ spectra of xte j0929314 , juett , galloway , & chakrabarty ( 2002 ) measure similarly discrepant power - law indices .",
    "they suggest an astrophysical origin for the discrepancy in xte j0929314 and xte  j1751305 in the form of a power - law with a break or a roll - over in the 1.44.4  kev range .",
    "a model consisting of blackbody and broken power - law components ( @xmath47 ) provides an improved fit to the spectrum of xte j1751305 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "although these results suggest that an astrophysical origin for the apparent spectral evolution is possible , a number of concerns remain . given that : ( 1 ) the effective area ( flux ) calibration of the epic - pn",
    "has 5% uncertainties ( kirsch 2002 ) , ( 2 ) the letgs ( plus acis - s array ) flux calibration has 10% uncertainties above 1  kev ( h. marshall , priv .",
    "comm . ) , ( 3 ) that _ rxte _ pca and high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) observations of the `` crab '' nebula ( taken to be a pure power - law for calibration ) differ in power - law index by @xmath49 ( see , e.g. , wilms et al .",
    "1999 ) , and ( 4 ) that markwardt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) did not fit a blackbody component to the _ rxte _ spectra of xte  j1751305 , we do not consider an astrophysical origin for the discrepant indices to be required by the present data .",
    "the upper limits on the strength of narrow ( consistent with instrument resolution ; fwhm @xmath3 0.1  kev ) and broad ( fhwm @xmath50 0.7  kev ) fe k@xmath31 emission lines are 4  ev and 6  ev , respectively ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "this stands in contrast the detection of a weak fe k@xmath31 line in outburst spectra of the 401  hz millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.43658 obtained with",
    "( heindl & smith 1998 ; gierlinski , done , & barret 2002 ) .",
    "it is possible that a strong , hot corona ( or the magnetosphere , if the coranae in these lmxbs is small or disrupted ) which produces to the power - law component may ionize the disk in xte  j1751@xmath5305 to a degree which prevents fe  k@xmath31 emission .",
    "the absence of h - like and he - like resonance emission lines like those observed in 4u 162667 ( schulz et al . 2001 ) in the spectrum of xte j1751305 is also consistent with a highly ionized disk in this source .",
    "secondarily , the absence of such lines may be due to differences in the accretion flow geometry due to the neutron star magnetic field . whereas the magnetic field in xte  j1751@xmath5305 is likely to be similar to that in sax  j1808.6@xmath53658 ( @xmath51  g ; wijnands & van der klis 1998a ) , the magnetic field in 4u  1626@xmath567 is likely much higher ( @xmath52  g , orlandini et al .",
    "the stronger magnetic field in 4u 162667 may disrupt the inner disk , allowing cool material in the outer disk to be irradiated by a weaker corona .",
    "emission lines have also been seen in neutron star systems which are viewed edge - on ( so - called accretion disk coronae or `` adc '' sources ; see , e.g. , kallman et al .",
    "2002 ) ; the absence of emission lines in xte j1751305 may also be partially due to a low system inclination ( markwardt et al .",
    "2002 report no evidence of dips or eclipses ) .",
    "studies of some ultra - compact systems suggest a ne - rich companion ( for observational results , see : schulz et al .",
    "2001 ; juett , psaltis , & chakrabarty 2001 ; for theoretical discussions see yungelson , nelemans , & van den heuvel 2002 ; bildsten 2002 )",
    ". fits to the ne photoelectric absorption edge in the rgs spectra of xte j1751305 constrain the abundance of ne to be at most 77% of the solar value along this line of sight ( 95% confidence upper - limit ; see section 3.3 ) .",
    "this may suggest that a ne - rich companion is unlikely in the case of xte j1751305 .",
