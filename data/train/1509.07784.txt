    "measurements of azimuthal anisotropies of particle emission in relativistic heavy ion collisions have proven to be an essential tool in probing the properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in such collisions .",
    "these anisotropies can be quantified  @xcite by the coefficients @xmath0 in the fourier expansion of the particle distributions with respect to symmetry planes of the same - order @xmath7 that are determined on an event - by - event basis : @xmath14 , where @xmath8 is the order of the harmonic , @xmath15 is the azimuthal angle of particles of a given type , and @xmath7 is the azimuthal angle of the @xmath16-order symmetry plane .",
    "measurements of the second harmonic , which indicates the strength of the `` elliptic flow '' , led to the conclusion that the qgp produced at rhic behaves as a nearly inviscid fluid  @xcite . in the last decade ,",
    "significant effort , both experimentally and theoretically , has gone towards quantifying the specific viscosity @xmath17 ( shear viscosity over entropy density ) of the produced qgp , as well as its temperature dependence .",
    "elliptic flow is thought to arise from the initial spatial anisotropy in the nuclear overlap zone , which has a lenticular shape in off - center nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath18@xmath5@xmath18 ) collisions .",
    "this spatial anisotropy is then converted to a momentum - space anisotropy through the pressure gradients in the expanding fluid .",
    "measurements of @xmath11 have been performed in symmetric @xmath18@xmath5@xmath18 collision for a variety of collision energies and particle species as a function of transverse momentum , rapidity , and system size  @xcite .",
    "various scaling properties have been explored with the goal of understanding the onset of qgp formation with center - of - mass energy and how its properties may vary . the elliptic flow scaled by the corresponding initial spatial eccentricity ( @xmath19 )",
    "was found to follow a universal trend when plotted against the produced particle density in the transverse plane  @xcite over a broad range of center - of - mass energies . in a more recent study",
    "@xcite , phenix showed that the transverse particle density is proportional to the third root of the number of participant nucleons @xmath20 and that scaling with @xmath21 removes the remaining system - size dependencies at various center - of - mass energies .",
    "the first - order fourier coefficient @xmath22 , which is a measure of the strength of the `` directed flow '' , has also been studied in symmetric @xmath18@xmath5@xmath18 collisions over a broad range of energies  @xcite .",
    "most studies focus on measurements of -integrated values of @xmath22 as a function of rapidity or pseudorapidity , and the slope of @xmath23 at midrapidity , which may yield information on the location of a first - order phase transition in the phase diagram of nuclear matter  @xcite . in symmetric",
    "@xmath18@xmath5@xmath18 collisions , if the nuclei are considered to be smooth spheres , @xmath22 is an odd function with respect to ( pseudo)rapidity and vanishes at midrapidity , which is consistent with the -integrated measurements .    indeed ,",
    "when the nuclei are taken as smooth spheres , all odd harmonics should vanish at midrapidity .",
    "however , event - by - event fluctuations in the initial geometry can lead to nonzero odd harmonics at midrapidity  @xcite .",
    "sizable values for these harmonics have been measured at both rhic ( @xmath12 )  @xcite and the lhc ( @xmath12 and @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "evidence for a small rapidity - even component of @xmath22 at midrapidity has also been observed  @xcite . the combined experimental information from odd and even flow harmonics provides much more stringent constraints on the theoretical models  @xcite and the extracted qgp properties than measurements of elliptic flow alone .",
    "despite the wealth of experimental data and theoretical studies , uncertainties in the energy density deposition in the initial state of the heavy ion collisions remain the limiting factor in deducing the specific viscosity of the qgp .",
    "asymmetric collision systems , such as cu@xmath5au , provide opportunities to study the effect of the initial geometry on the collective flow , particularly because odd harmonics may be enhanced at midrapidity beyond the fluctuation effects . in this paper , we present measurements of @xmath22 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 of charged particles and identified hadrons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 produced at midrapidity in cu@xmath5au collisions at =  200  gev . in sec .",

    ", we used ampt v2.21 with string melting turned on to generate approximately 2 million minimum bias cu@xmath5au events at @xmath6 gev , setting the partonic cross section alternately to @xmath86 mb and 3.0 mb . in the default version of the model , initial conditions are generated using monte carlo glauber with a _ gray disk _ approach to nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "in this study we utilize a modified _ black disk _ glauber model with a fixed nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section of 42 mb , as used in ref .  @xcite .    following the method of @xcite , fourier coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath12",
    "are calculated for unidentified charged hadrons within @xmath88 , with respect to the corresponding participant planes @xmath89 and @xmath50 .",
    "these plane angles are computed for each event from the initial coordinates of nucleon participants with a gaussian smearing of width @xmath90 fm .    the @xmath64 and @xmath65 results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2_ampt ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : v3_ampt ] are well reproduced by the model for @xmath91 gev/@xmath38 .",
    "the comparison with the data indicates that the 3.0 mb partonic cross section gives a better description of the system dynamics .    however , the calculation of @xmath22 and its comparison with experimental data is less straightforward . because the experimentally measured cu spectator neutron orientation is unknown ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath22 values with respect to the impact parameter vector @xmath92 pointing in the direction of the cu nucleus as well as with respect to @xmath43 , the overlap region calculated as previously described . because the calculation is done in the participant center - of - mass frame , weighting all participants equally yields exactly @xmath93 = 0 and hence no direction for @xmath43 .",
    "there are various suggestions in the literature for weighting with @xmath94 and @xmath95  @xcite , and in this study we choose to use @xmath94 .",
    "in addition , we have considered two different monte carlo glauber initial conditions , one with black disk ( bd ) nucleons and one with gray disk ( gd ) nucleons , thus varying the diffuseness of the nucleon - nucleon interaction radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : ampt_glauber_comparison ] shows results for cu@xmath5au collisions within the 30%-40% centrality selection on the relative distribution of @xmath43 to @xmath92 pointing the direction of the cu nucleus .",
    "panel ( a ) is for the bd case and panel ( b ) the gd case .",
    "this small difference in the treatment of initial geometry completely re - orients the @xmath43 vector .",
    "the lower panels show the ampt midrapidity particle @xmath22 as a function of relative to @xmath43 and @xmath92 again the bd and gd implementation .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the gd case where the two results agree , the prediction is for low particles moving in the direction of the au nucleus and the high particles in the direction of the cu nucleus ( opposite to the previously discussed hydrodynamic prediction ) .",
    "we note that it is currently unknown whether the spectator neutrons bend toward or away from the interaction overlap region between the nuclei , and whether they are oriented along the impact parameter vector @xmath92 , along the vector @xmath43 determined by the initial energy density in the overlap region , or some other vector .",
    "in fact , it is conceivable that spectators very close to the overlap region have a different behavior from spectators far away from the overlap .",
    "these ambiguities need resolution before a more direct theory to data comparison can be made .",
    "anisotropic flow coefficients for inclusive charged particles and identified hadrons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 produced in cu@xmath5au collisions at @xmath10 = 200 gev have been measured by the phenix experiment at rhic using event plane techniques .",
    "the @xmath22 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 measurements were performed at midrapidity as a function of transverse momentum over a broad range of collision centralities .",
    "mass ordering was observed for low in the identified particle measurements , as predicted by hydrodynamics .",
    "a system size comparison was performed for the inclusive charged particles using previous phenix measurements at @xmath10 = 200 gev of @xmath64 in cu@xmath5cu and au@xmath5au collisions , and @xmath65 in au@xmath5au collisions .",
    "the elliptic flow measurements between different systems and centrality selections were found to scale with the product of the initial participant eccentricity and the third root of the number of nucleon participants @xmath71 .",
    "the system size dependence of the @xmath65 values could be described by participant eccentricity @xmath74 scaling alone , although scaling with @xmath96 was also found to be adequate .",
    "the inclusive charged - particle measurements were compared to theoretical predictions . in the @xmath22 measurement , we observed negative values at high , indicating that hadrons are emitted in the transverse plane preferentially in the hemisphere of the spectators from the au nucleus , assuming that they moved outward from the interaction region and are aligned with the impact parameter vector .",
    "the ampt transport model calculations were found to be in agreement with the magnitude of the measured @xmath60 signals , but having the opposite sign . at low ( @xmath97 gev/@xmath38 )",
    "ampt provides a reasonable description of the triangular flow in all measured centrality classes that cover the 0%30% range , and the elliptic flow measurements in the 0%60% range .",
    "event - by - event hydrodynamics calculations with specific viscosity in the range @xmath98 reproduce the measured @xmath64 and @xmath65 values .",
