    "electromagnetic transition form factor of light mesons is one of the key ingredients to study hadron properties and it recently gains intensive interests . there are fruitful updated measurements from different experimental collaborations , such as na60  @xcite , snd  @xcite and babar  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the transition form factor provides us an important tool to study the intrinsic properties of light hadrons , including light pseudoscalar mesons and vector resonances . of more importance",
    ", it may also help to reduce the hadronic uncertainties in the light by light scattering , which is an important source of theoretical uncertainties of the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "the transition form factor of @xmath12 is one of the most important form factors in the light by light scattering .",
    "physics involved in this kind of form factor is quite complicated , since one needs to handle different dynamics within a broad range of energy region . in the very high and low energy regions , we have reliable and model - independent theoretical tools , namely pqcd and chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath13pt ) . while this is not the case in the intermediate energy region , where various resonances enter . in the present work ,",
    "we follow the chiral effective field theory explicitly including resonance states developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the radiative transition form factors involved with vector resonances .",
    "@xmath13pt is a model - independent method to describe the qcd dynamics in the very low energy region ( @xmath14 ) , which is based on chiral symmetry and expansions in terms of external momentum and light quark masses  @xcite .",
    "however the dynamical degrees of freedom in @xmath13pt are restricted to the light pseudo - goldstone bosons @xmath15  @xcite . in the intermediate energy region ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "clearly the resonance fields need to be explicitly included",
    "@xcite proposed an approach to incorporate resonances in a chiral covariant way . in this theory , not only the chiral symmetry but also the qcd inspired high - energy behaviors at large @xmath17 are implemented , which makes the resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath13 t ) bear more properties of qcd .",
    "moreover , to implement the high energy constraints in the chiral effective theory also makes it possible to apply the results from this theory directly to some form factors with virtual particles , such as those in light by light scattering , where the qcd high energy behavior can be important  @xcite . at the practical level ,",
    "to impose the high energy constraints is an efficient way to reduce the number of free resonance coupling , which makes r@xmath13 t more predictive in the phenomenological discussions  @xcite .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we have performed an extensive study on the electromagnetic transition form factors and decays of light pseudoscalar mesons @xmath18 in the framework of r@xmath13 t . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the similar form factors and decays but involving light vector resonances .",
    "the relevant resonance operators in these kinds of processes are of the odd - intrinsic - parity type . for the odd - intrinsic - parity sector ,",
    "@xcite introduced a general effective chiral lagrangian containing symmetry allowed interactions between two vector objects ( currents or lowest multiplet of resonances ) and one pseudoscalar meson , by employing the antisymmetric tensor formalism as used in  ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the vector resonances .",
    "while in ref .",
    "@xcite , similar study was carried out but the vector resonances was described in terms of the proca vector field representation .",
    "later on , the vector - vector - pseudoscalar ( @xmath19 ) type lagrangian with vector resonances in the antisymmetric tensor representation has been put forward in different aspects : ref .",
    "@xcite introduced a second nonet of vector resonances , ref .",
    "@xcite worked out the complete base of resonance operators that are relevant to the @xmath20 @xmath13pt lagrangian in the anomaly sector and in ref .",
    "@xcite we have made a comprehensive discussion on the inclusion of the singlet @xmath21 . though we see impressive progresses in this research field , one still needs to bear in mind that in the strict large @xmath17 qcd there is an infinite tower of zero - width resonances . in practice",
    ", typically one has to truncate the tower to the lowest multiplet of resonances , which is named as the minimal hadronical ansatz in ref .  @xcite . under this approximation ,",
    "r@xmath13 t has been successfully applied to the phenomenological study on many processes where the intermediate resonances play an important role  @xcite .",
    "however , we notice that in the previous study of r@xmath13 t , most efforts have been made on the lowest lying resonances . for example , in the vector sector , the lowest nonet of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 has been extensively studied , while investigation on the higher mass resonances is relatively rare .",
    "so one of the important improvements of our present work is to study the excited vector resonances in chiral effective theory , comparing with our previous work  @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "recently the babar collaboration has measured the @xmath26 cross sections from the threshold to the energy region around 2 @xmath27 3  gev  @xcite , which enables us to study properties of more massive vector resonances , i.e. , @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 . in this measurement , the moduli and relative phases of isoscalar and isovector components of the @xmath26 cross sections are provided .",
    "the updated data make a strong constraint on the free parameters in our theory and hence allow us to accurately extract the resonance properties , such the masses and widths of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( and also @xmath9 ) , their mixings , as well as their couplings to light mesons .",
    "the @xmath28 mixing angle is estimated and we find that it is far from the ideal mixing case .",
    "another important issue we will address in this article is the @xmath10 symmetry breaking effect in radiative decays . an ideal process",
    "to study this effect is @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is well known that the ratio @xmath31 in the @xmath10 limit  @xcite , while the world average value from experimental measurements is around @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath10 symmetry breaking effect has been discussed in many previous works  @xcite . in the framework of r@xmath13 t",
    ", it is interesting to point out that there exists a special resonance operator @xmath33{\\rangle}$ ]  @xcite , which contributes exclusively to the charged processes @xmath30 .",
    "hence it provides an important source of @xmath10 symmetry breaking .",
    "in fact , ref  @xcite has determined several values for the @xmath34 parameter in the discussion of hadronic @xmath35 decays .",
    "our present work provides another way to determine its value and allows us to check which kinds of values from ref .",
    "@xcite are reasonable",
    ". a careful analysis of the strengths of different @xmath10 breaking terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 will be delivered in our work .",
    "contrary to the @xmath38 process , the @xmath39 form factor is free of of large @xmath10 corrections .",
    "nevertheless , another difficulty arises in this form factor , since it is found that the well - established vector - meson - dominant ( vmd ) model fails to describe @xmath40  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we discuss this transition form factor in r@xmath13 t by including excited vector resonances in addition to the @xmath22 .",
    "we will also confront our theoretical results with the new measurements from snd collaboration  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , it has been demonstrated that this single operator can well explain the mass splittings of @xmath22 , @xmath66 and @xmath25 .",
    "in addition to the mass splittings of these vector resonances , this operator is also shown to be able to perfectly reproduce the quark mass dependences of the @xmath22 mass from the lattice simulation  @xcite .",
    "we will then employ the single operator in eq .   to account for the mass splittings of the lowest vector multiplet in this work .",
    "additional @xmath64 suppressed operators , such as @xmath67 , will not be considered for the well - established ground vectors , due to the fact that @xmath23 and @xmath25 in the ground multiplet are well described by the ideal mixing between the octet and singlet vector states .",
    "while because of the unclear situation for the excited vectors , the @xmath64 suppressed operators will be however introduced for them in later discussion .",
    "combining eqs .   and , it can be easily verified that the physical states of @xmath23 and @xmath25 result from the ideal mixing of @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 then the mass splitting pattern of the ground vector multiplet takes the form @xmath71 where we have used the leading order relations @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    for the general interaction lagrangian linear in @xmath74 up to @xmath45 , it reads  @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76 with @xmath77 the field strength tensors of the left and right external sources @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",

    "the equivalent operators to eq .",
    "involving the excited vector multiplet @xmath85 happen to be irrelevant to the discussions in the present article .",
    "for latter convenience , we follow the convention introduced in ref .",

    "@xmath89    in the present article , since we focus on the processes involving pion and kaon , the additional operators that we introduced in ref .",

    "so we do not elaborate more on this issue .",
    "the flavor structure for the excited vector multiplet @xmath85 is the same as the ground multiplet in eq .  . while unlike the well - established entries in the ground vector multiplet , the contents of the excited vector multiplet are still not clear",
    ". therefore we include a general set of mass splitting operators to describe the excited vectors , instead of only using a single operator in the ground multiplet case . up to the linear quark",
    "mass corrections , the pertinent operators read  @xcite @xmath92 where the second operator is @xmath64 suppressed compared to the first one and @xmath93 is the mass of excited vector multiplet in chiral limit .",
    "another type operator , e.g. @xmath94 , was also introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we consider this operator is less relevant compared to the two terms in eq .  .",
    "the reason is that compared to the @xmath95 term though the @xmath96 term is @xmath64 suppressed , its chiral order is enhanced . while for the @xmath97 term , its chiral and @xmath64 orders are both suppressed .",
    "owing to the @xmath64 suppressed operator in eq .  , the excited states @xmath9 and @xmath8 can not be simply described as the ideal mixing of @xmath98 and @xmath99 as in the ground state case .",

    "not only the quark mass corrections to the resonance masses but also to interacting vertexes are important to fully study the @xmath10 symmetry breaking effects .",
    "the @xmath19-type lagrangians introduced in eqs .  , which are constructed by using the chiral building bricks of the pseudo - goldstone mesons , provides us an appropriate framework to systematically take into account the relevant interacting vertexes .",
    "though it consists of a large number of free couplings , we will see later that in a given process not all of them are independent .",
    "in fact in our present discussion , at most only six of the combinations of the @xmath19-type couplings will appear after taking into account the high energy constraints dictated by qcd .    to impose the high energy constraints will not only make the r@xmath13 t bear more properties from qcd , but will also be helpful to reduce the number of free parameters . to proceed , we match the leading operator product expansion ( ope ) of the @xmath19 green function with the result evaluated within r@xmath13 t and require the vector form factor vanish in the high energy limit .",
    "this leads to the following constraints on resonance couplings @xmath107 which are already given by one of us in ref .",

    "the excited vector resonances are found to be essential to reproduce the @xmath262 form - factor data from snd and the cleo @xmath6 spectral function from tau decays .",
    "although the low energy @xmath6 form - factor data from na60 can be well reproduced in our approach , the steep rise behavior close to the upper kinematical boundary region @xmath263 , is still not fully understood in the current work , even after taking into account the excited vector resonances .",

    "<S> within the framework of chiral effective field theory , we study various electromagnetic processes with light vector resonances : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the @xmath2 form factors . with two multiplets of vector resonances being introduced , we fit the decay widths of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the pertinent measurements from the @xmath5 cross sections , such as moduli and relative phases between the isoscalar and isovector components from babar collaboration , together with the @xmath6 form factors from na60 , snd and cleo collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> the values of resonance couplings , masses and widths of the excited vector states @xmath7 and @xmath8 are then determined . the @xmath9-@xmath8 mixing angle is discussed and turns out to be quite different from the ideal mixing case . </S>",
    "<S> three sources of @xmath10 symmetry breaking effects in the @xmath11 decays are identified and analyzed in detail . </S>"
