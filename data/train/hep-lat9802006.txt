    "recently a lot of studies are devoted to search for improved actions which have much less lattice artifacts than the original wilson action .",
    "two approaches are mainly pursued to construct the improved actions , i.e. , wilson s renormalization group ( rg ) method@xcite and symanzik s perturbation one@xcite .",
    "the rg approach has been further developed by p.hasenfraz , niedermayer@xcite and co - workers@xcite , which leads to the classical perfect action .",
    "symanzik approach has become very promising in lattice simulations with the idea of the tadpole improvement@xcite .",
    "the classical perfect action is an approximation to the quantum perfect action which is completely free from lattice artifacts .",
    "although finding quantum perfect actions is a hard task , we have been trying to obtain them by using the monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) method@xcite . in mcrg , we first block lattice configurations and then determine renormalized coupling constants which show the coupling flow under a certain blocking scheme .",
    "last year we obtained coupling flow in 2 dimensional space@xcite . to control truncation effects we continue our study by adding more coupling constants .",
    "the action we use here is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 stands for the type of wilson loops summarized in table 1 .",
    ".wilson loops [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     although we consider actions up to 7 coupling constants in determining the coupling flow , here we mainly focus on a 3 dimensional coupling space @xmath0 , @xmath5 last year we only considered two coupling constants @xmath2 .",
    "this year the term @xmath1 in eq.([eq ] ) is newly added .",
    "there are several determination techniques of coupling constants . at the early stage of our study we used the demon method@xcite which needs an extra simulation ( microcanonical simulation ) to obtain values of the coupling constants .",
    "we now use the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation method@xcite which is computationally simple and needs no extra simulation .",
    "truncation effects may cause different results in the two methods . indeed in 2",
    "coupling space @xmath2 we found @xmath6 difference in the coupling constants . if the truncation effects would be negligibly small the result should be same in both cases .",
    "we employ the lattice of the size of @xmath7 .",
    "we generate configurations at certain @xmath8 sets @xmath2 then block the configurations .",
    "the @xmath8 sets are chosen from the rg coupling flow obtained in 2 dimensional space in ref.@xcite and the iwasaki action . at each set of @xmath8",
    "about 200 configurations separated by 10 sweeps are used for the study . on the blocked configurations we calculate values of wilson loops and correlation between wilson loops , then solve the sd equations .",
    "first we show a result of coupling constants after one blocking starting at @xmath9 .",
    "the result clearly shows an exponential decay with the length of wilson loops , which indicates that contribution of coupling constants associated with large wilson loops decreases rapidly .",
    "see fig.1 .",
    "we now turn to the 3 dimensional coupling space @xmath0 .",
    "figs.2 and 3 show coupling flow projected on @xmath2 and @xmath10 coupling space , respectively .",
    "the result projected on the @xmath2 space is very similar with the previous result@xcite in 2 dimensional space and the value of coupling constant @xmath1 is very small compared to other two coupling constants , which means adding the coupling constant @xmath1 does not change the coupling flow very much .",
    "fig.4 shows the coupling flow drawn in 3 dimensional space .",
    "the renormalized trajectory may be read off joining the end points of the arrows .",
