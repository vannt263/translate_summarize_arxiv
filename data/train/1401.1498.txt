    "the concept of magnetic reconnection is important to understand a variety of plasma phenomena observed in astrophysics , space physics , fusion plasma physics from a unified viewpoint .",
    "aurorae are believed to be related to the magnetic reconnection in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "extremely large amount of energy release in solar flare is considered to be due to the reconnection .",
    "several jets ubiquitously observed in astrophysical objects may be caused by the magnetic reconnection .",
    "reconnection of the magnetic field has also been proposed as a source of the viscous dissipation in the accretion disk .",
    "a steady state of magnetic reconnection was investigated by sweet and parker with the aid of a simple magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model.@xcite however , their model was found to be not sufficient when it is applied to solar flares .",
    "most obvious problems in the theory of magnetic reconnection have been how to realize a fast reconnection and how to bridge the gap of scales . since then",
    "several researchers including petschek have tackled this fast magnetic reconnection mechanism.@xcite the reconnection rate or inflow alfvn mach number @xmath0 in the sweet ",
    "parker mechanism is written as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the inflow speed , @xmath3 the inflow alfvn speed , @xmath4 the thickness of the diffusion region , @xmath5 the length scale of phenomena , @xmath6 the lundquist number ( the magnetic reynolds number based on the inflow alfvn speed ) . in the astrophysical and space plasma situations , the lundquist number is usually huge ( @xmath7 ) , so the reconnection rate becomes very small with the sweet  parker model .",
    "in other words , magnetic reconnection model applied to the astrophysical and space plasma situations is too slow to explain the real phenomena such as the solar flare .",
    "another problem is the gap of scales . in the solar flare case ,",
    "the typical scale of phenomena is @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the thickness of diffusion region or current sheet is @xmath9 ( @xmath10 : ion - lamor radius ) .",
    "this means that the dynamics of very huge scale motions are determined by that of very small - scale behaviors of the magnetic field . in order to get a realistic view of the solar flare phenomena , we need highly localized effective resistivity , and also something that match this scale gap .",
    "several mechanisms that potentially elucidate the fast and localized reconnection through the enhanced resistivity have been investigated , which include the electron inertia,@xcite hall effect,@xcite electron pressure,@xcite ambipolar diffusion,@xcite kinetic effect,@xcite etc .",
    "turbulence is also considered as one of such effects .",
    "a prominent feature of turbulence is multiple - scale interaction of motions . due to the nonlinear term in navier  stokes equation , the dynamics of motion represented by wave number mode @xmath11",
    "is governed by its interaction with all the other scales of motions .",
    "another prominent feature is that turbulence enhances transport of the system very much .",
    "the representative effects are the eddy viscosity , eddy diffusivity , turbulent magnetic diffusivity , etc . in the case of magnetic diffusivity ,",
    "the molecular diffusivity @xmath12 is enhanced by turbulence as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "the ratio of the turbulent to molecular magnetic diffusivities is written as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the turbulent magnetic reynolds number . in astrophysical and space physics phenomena",
    ", the magnetic reynolds number is huge .",
    "so , the turbulent counterpart is also expected to be very large .",
    "this means that the effective magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence is much larger than the molecular one ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we should note that , in the context of mean - field magnetic reconnection , the large effective magnetic diffusivity does not necessarily lead to the fast and enhanced reconnection .",
    "this has been recently shown numerically with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence model simulations.@xcite we will return to this point later in   v.c . if the magnetic field structure is diffused everywhere by the enhanced magnetic diffusivity , we just have diffusion or annihilation of the oppositely directed magnetic field in a broad region .",
    "there it is difficult to generate open fast reconnection jets from the mean magnetic field . in order to get a fast reconnection , the region of high diffusivity",
    "should be confined to a very small region .",
    "since turbulence is expected to play an important role in enhancing the magnetic reconnection rate and also to bridge the scale gap between the the dissipation scale and the scale of phenomena,@xcite over the past few decades , a considerable number of studies have been made on turbulent reconnection . in the context of fast reconnection",
    ", we should note that the magnetic reconnection rate is basically determined by the ratio of the thickness and width of the reconnection region . in order to get a fast reconnection",
    ", we have two ways : ( i ) increasing the effective thickness due to the fluctuating motion of the magnetic field ; ( ii ) decreasing the effective width by generating multiple magnetic islands ( fractal structure , plasmoids , etc.).@xcite    one of the earliest investigations on the turbulence effects on magnetic reconnection was made by matthaeus and lamkin.@xcite they numerically examined the temporal evolution of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic electric current sheet with imposing the initial fluctuations with a wide range of spectrum .",
    "it was reported that the current sheets produce corrugations at large scales and magnetic islands at small scales . due to these corrugations and magnetic - island motions ,",
    "multiple x - point structures are generated , which lead to the fast reconnection .",
    "it was shown that the fluctuations lead to the fast reconnection through the generation of the multiple x points .",
    "on the basis of a heuristic argument of the alfvnic turbulence by goldreich and sridhar,@xcite lazarian and vishniac developed a scaling theory of turbulent magnetic reconnection.@xcite due to the stochastic motions of magnetic fields , the effective thickness of the reconnection region becomes much larger , leading to a much larger reconnection rate .",
    "their result suggests that the reconnection rate is not determined by the microphysics quantities such as the molecular diffusivity but by the turbulent quantities .",
    "recently eyink _ et al .",
    "_  interpreted the stochastic motions of magnetic fields as the richardson diffusion , and by using the lagrangian trajectory formulation , obtained the reconnection - rate expression equivalent to the lazarian and vishniac one.@xcite    guo _ et al . _",
    "examined turbulent reconnection in the framework of the resistive reduced magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd).@xcite they adopted a mean - field approach and treat the inhomogeneity of the reconnected magnetic field .",
    "they focused on the dynamics of the magnetic helicity density in a state of preexisting turbulence . using some kinds of closure theory of turbulence",
    ", they obtained the expressions for the magnetic reconnection rate in the noisy and alfvn - wave turbulence cases .",
    "the reconnection rates is very weakly dependent on the amplitude of the turbulence , which suggests that even with a very weak turbulence , the reconnection can be very fast .    with the developments of the computer resources ,",
    "numerical investigations of turbulent magnetic reconnection has been recently developed .",
    "such numerical simulations may be divided into several categories depending on what kind of turbulence is supposed as well as on what kind of geometrical setting is adopted for the simulation .",
    "the geometrical settings include the dimensionality ( 2d or 3d ) , boundary conditions ( periodic or open ) , etc .",
    "on the other hand , the turbulence property includes the following : what is the source of turbulence ( instability such as tearing mode , injected one with external forcing , or small - scale reconnection itself ) ? how does the fluctuation spatially distributed inside and outside the reconnection region ? in which scale turbulence is injected or generated ?",
    "servido _ et al .",
    "_  investigated turbulent reconnection by numerically solving 2d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations with a periodic boundary condition at high reynolds number.@xcite they found that a large number of x - point structures with various sizes and energies are generated , and a reconnection occurs at each x - point .",
    "the reconnection rate ranges from small to large depending on each reconnection event",
    ". statistical analysis of these reconnection events showed that the thickness and width of the reconnection regions correspond to the dissipation and correlation length scales of turbulence , respectively .",
    "this result suggests that the magnetic reconnection is subject to the statistical nature of turbulence .",
    "kowal _ et al .",
    "_  performed elaborated 3d numerical simulations of mhd equations with non - periodic boundary conditions and examined turbulence effects on magnetic reconnection.@xcite they first made the fields evolve without any fluctuations , then at some moment started externally imposing turbulence and saw the temporal evolution of the magnetic reconnection rate .",
    "dependence of the reconnection rate on several factors such as the magnitude of fluctuation , scale of injection , magnitude of molecular diffusivity , guide field , etc .  was extensively investigated .",
    "the basic results were as follows .",
    "the magnetic reconnection rate is largely enhanced in the turbulent state , and the rate does not depend on the molecular magnetic diffusivity .",
    "it was also shown that the larger the magnitude of fluctuation imposed and the turbulence injection scale is , the larger the reconnection rate becomes .",
    "they suggested that several collisionless effects are irrelevant to the reconnection rate in the turbulent state .",
    "these results are considered to confirm the idea of fast reconnection due to the magnetic - field wandering proposed by lazarian and vishniac .    using 2d direct numerical simulations with a periodic boundary condition , loureiro _ et al .",
    "_  investigated how the background noise has an effect on the fast reconnection.@xcite it was shown that the dependence of the reconnection rate on the lundquist number decreases as the turbulence level increases .",
    "this result suggests that , in turbulence , the reconnection rate does not depend on the microscopic physics but only on the nonlinear dynamics of turbulence .",
    "another class of approaches to turbulent reconnection is the plasmoid instability one .",
    "a large number of simulation studies have been done to explore the tearing instability of current sheets and to examine the formation of the secondary magnetic island called plasmoid.@xcite in this approach , turbulent reconnection is explored without resorting to any pre - existing turbulence .",
    "the formation of multiple plasmoid effectively reduces the width of the reconnection region , and consequently contribute to a fast reconnection .",
    "et al . _",
    "showed the independence of the reconnection rate on the lundquist number in the fast reconnection due to the plasmoid instability.@xcite another important point is that the multiple plasmoid generation reduces the length scale to reach a scale smaller than the magnetohydrodynamic limit.@xcite specific mechanisms based on a hierarchy of plasmoids have been proposed to bridge global scale to dissipation scale in the context of the so - called reconnection phase diagram.@xcite how and how much turbulence is generated from laminar current sheets in a fully realistic physical parameter regime is a very important question . how turbulence interacts with the plasmoid instability is still an open question . in the collisionless regime , it is considered that we have not yet seen a significant effect of mhd - scale turbulence on the reconnection rate , nor have we seen evidence of significantly enhanced transport due to mhd turbulence in the numerical simulations where the current sheet scale is of order of ion gyro - radius.@xcite at the same time , we should note the fact that there are examples of fast reconnection without a plasmoid .",
    "the plasmoid formed in an elongated current sheet can contribute to reduce the inertia resistivity , and the formation of many plasmoids does not necessarily mean the enhancement of magnetic dissipation in a collisionless regime .",
    "it is required to study carefully a macro - micro scale coupling process in a large scale kinetic simulation . for summary of recent studies and future perspectives ,",
    "the reader is referred to a review by karimabadi and lazarian.@xcite    if the turbulence effect is incorporated into the dynamics of the large - scale fields , the behavior of large - scale fields is considerably affected by turbulence through the drastic change of the effective transport . since turbulence enhances the effective diffusivity , turbulence may enhance the magnetic reconnection very much .",
    "however , as was stressed in our previous paper,@xcite this effect is not so self - evident . in most of the previous work that incorporates turbulence effect into the magnetic reconnection process",
    ", turbulence is externally imposed or given as a fixed ingredient .",
    "this treatment is not sufficient enough .",
    "it is true that turbulence determines the dynamics of the mean fields through the effective or turbulence transport . at the same time , the mean - field configurations , which are subject to the turbulence effect , also determine the properties of turbulence .",
    "dynamics of mean - field configuration and turbulence have to be simultaneously treated in a consistent manner.@xcite considering these points , the obvious questions to be addressed are as follows :    - how and how much turbulence is generated and sustained in the magnetic - reconnection configuration ;    - how enhanced transport coefficients due to turbulence are spatiotemporally distributed ;    - how the effective transport is related to the magnetic reconnection rate .    in order to address these questions",
    ", we have to treat the mutual interaction of the mean - field structures and turbulence in a consistent manner .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to show a consistent approach to these questions .    for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the mean - field approach to the turbulent magnetic reconnection in this work since this approach provides a powerful tool for investigating the interplay between the fluctuation and large - scale inhomogeneities in the realistic physical parameter domain . obviously , the choice of turbulence model is of primary importance .",
    "we easily imagine that a simple heuristic turbulence modeling adopting gradient - diffusion approximations such as eddy viscosity , turbulent magnetic diffusivity , etc .  may not work well",
    ". we should remember that a simple eddy - viscosity - type model completely fails even in hydrodynamic case if it is applied to a turbulent swirling flow .",
    "instead , we need turbulence modeling based on the fundamental equations of magnetohydrodynamics . such models should include turbulence effects other than the simple eddy viscosity and diffusivities . in this work",
    ", we adopt a turbulence model on the basis of an elaborated closure theory for inhomogeneous turbulence at very high kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers.@xcite as we see later , the model expressions for the turbulent electromotive force [ eq .  ( [ eq : emf_exp ] ) ] and the reynolds stress [ eq .  ( [ eq : rey_stress_exp ] ) ] themselves have been confirmed by a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the kolmogorov flow with a strong imposed magnetic field.@xcite also we should note that this type of mean - field or turbulence model approach has been applied to the solar - wind turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field and a fast velocity with shears , and successfully reproduced the evolution of alfvnicity in solar - wind turbulence : the spatial distributions of the turbulent cross helicity and the turbulent mhd residual energy ( difference between the kinetic and magnetic energies ) observed by satellite.@xcite in this sense , the validity of the mean - field approach has already been confirmed in the context of the magnetic turbulence .",
    "the applicability of the mean - field approach in the context of magnetic reconnection will be furhter discussed later .",

    ". this treatment does not deny possible importance of such effects .",
    "actually importance of the effects beyond the mhd has been reported by several authors.@xcite here we concentrate our analysis on the mhd with turbulence incorporated and see what consequence we obtain .",

    "( [ eq : emf_exp ] ) and ( [ eq : rey_stress_exp ] ) ] , the transport coefficients are scalars .",
    "this does not deny the importance of anisotropy in magnetic turbulence . as some heuristic models showed,@xcite anisotropy is considered to play a very important role in mhd turbulence evolution especially in the context of the turbulent magnetic reconnection.@xcite    however",
    ", we should note the following points .",
    "firstly , even by using isotropic transport coefficients , we can well express the effects of anisotropy .",
    "this is because we solve the evolution equations for the transport coefficients ( or turbulent quantities that express the transport coefficients ) .",
    "those equations contain several mean fields and their inhomogeneities . in the present work ,",
    "the transport coefficients are determined by the inhomogeneities and anisotropy of the mean fields such as the magnetic field and velocity shears through the transport equations of the turbulent statistical quantities .",
    "for example , in the alfvnic turbulence fluctuations are constituted by the collection of alfvn waves .",
    "such a property is intrinsically incorporated into the transport equations of turbulence quantities , which are derived from the full mhd equations .",
    "asymmetry of the alfvn waves propagating parallel and antiparallel to the mean magnetic field leads to a finite turbulent cross helicity .",
    "this effect is implemented into the present turbulence model through the term @xmath90 ( energy inhomogeneity along the magnetic field ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_w_def ] ) .",
    "secondly , as in the magnetic turbulence case , it is often assumed in the theoretical and numerical studies of planetary atmosphere that the viscosity is anisotropic between the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "however , it is also shown that the isotropic eddy - viscosity formulation associated with the transport equations of turbulence quantities and timescales can reproduce the planetary superrotation without resorting any anisotropic viscosities.@xcite this fact clearly shows that an isotropic formulation of the turbulent viscosity properly implemented with the mean - field inhomogeneity arguments can treat anisotropic transport phenomena . in this sense ,",
    "our present model is not for homogeneous and isotropic turbulence but for inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence .",
    "the structures of the expressions for @xmath47 [ eq .  ( [ eq : emf_exp ] ) ] and @xmath56 [ eq .  ( [ eq : rey_stress_exp ] ) ]",
    "are similar each other .",

    "\\label{eq : mean_ind_exp}\\ ] ] as can be seen from @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_ind_exp ] ) , the @xmath14-related term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emf_exp ] ) represents the transport enhancement due to turbulence , which is called the turbulent magnetic diffusivity . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta_nuk_rel ] ) shows , in the presence of turbulence ( @xmath93 ) , we always have the turbulent magnetic diffusivity @xmath14 ( and the turbulent viscosity @xmath73 ) which is much larger than the molecular counterpart @xmath12 ( and @xmath94 ) .    at the same time , however , we may have some effects of pseudoscalars arising from the breakage of symmetry in turbulence .",
    "the second and third or @xmath76- and @xmath78-related terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_ind_exp ] ) may contribute to the magnetic - field generation .",
    "if we have a large cross correlation between the velocity and magnetic field in turbulence , it may act for balancing the enhanced magnetic - diffusivity ( and turbulent viscosity ) effect [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : emf_exp ] ) and ( [ eq : rey_stress_exp ] ) ] .",
    "if the @xmath76- and @xmath78-related terms are nearly balanced with the @xmath14-related term , we have eq .  ( [ eq : mean_ind_eq ] ) with @xmath95 as @xmath96 this is the same equation in form as the laminar induction equation .",
    "this suggests that , if the magnetic reynolds number is huge ( @xmath97 ) , the mean magnetic flux can be frozen in the fluid motion even in a highly turbulent state .",
    "this is a typical situation of the dynamic balance between the transport enhancement and suppression due to turbulence .",
    "we should note that although the equation and consequently the magnetic field behaviors appear very similar to the counterparts in the laminar case , the underlying physics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mean_ind_eq_wo_emf ] ) is entirely different from that of the laminar induction equation . in the dynamic balance case , where turbulence itself is present ,",
    "once the balance between the enhancement and suppression is broken , we usually encounter a strong transport enhancement depending on the level of turbulence .    the turbulence effect including the enhanced transport results from the properties of flow but not of fluid .",
    "so the transport coefficients in general depend on space and time .",
    "if we have no or very small pseudoscalar quantities in space or in time , then the enhancement of transport becomes dominant .",
    "there the turbulent electromotive force is expected to be represented only by the turbulent magnetic diffusivity as @xmath98 then the induction equation for the mean magnetic field is written as @xmath99 where the molecular magnetic diffusivity @xmath12 has been dropped since @xmath100 . only in such a region , we can expect the dominant effect of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "as for more fundamental discussions about the breakage condition of the magnetic - flux freezing , the reader is referred to a recent paper by eyink _",
    "et al . _  ( 2011 ) , where the flux - freezing of general magnetic fields ( not mean fields ) is well discussed from the viewpoint of the spontaneous stochasticity.@xcite    dynamic balance and non - balance between the transport enhancement and suppression is one of the most interesting features of turbulence .",
    "we see that the transport property due to turbulence is determined by the spatiotemporal evolution of the turbulent statistical quantities such as the turbulent mhd energy , cross helicity , and residual helicity . at the same time , as was stressed in ",
    "i and ref .",
    ", the evolution of turbulence is determined by the large - scale or mean - field configurations .",
    "dynamics of the mean fields and turbulence should be solved simultaneously .",
    "as for the other arguments related to the mitigation of turbulence mixing through the change of cascading rates due to the cross helicity , the reader is referred to the analysis of the imbalanced alfvnic turbulence.@xcite    as was predicted by our previous paper,@xcite even if the total amount or volume average of the turbulent cross helicity is zero , the turbulent cross helicity can be spatially or locally distributed positive and negative depending on the mean - field configuration . since it is a consequence of the symmetric and antisymmetric properties of the velocity and the magnetic field , the quadrupole - like spatial distribution of the cross helicity is ubiquitous around the current sheet.@xcite this is a prominent feature of pseudoscalar quantities , which is non - positive definite unlike pure scalars such as the energy .",
    "if the turbulent cross helicity changes its sign on the symmetry surface , its magnitude must be very small in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "this means that the transport suppression due to the turbulent cross helicity can not function in the vicinity of the symmetry surface , hence only the transport enhancement due to turbulence can effectively function there .",
    "again , this is a consequence of the dynamic ( non)balance between the transport enhancement due to the turbulent energy and the transport suppression due to the turbulent cross helicity .",
    "the dynamic balance of turbulence may contribute to the strong localization of the effective turbulent magnetic diffusivity , leading to the fast magnetic reconnection .",
    "schematic situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_balance ] .",
    "even if the spatial distribution of @xmath14 is broad , the balancing with @xmath76 may lead to a fairly localized distribution of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity .",
    "schematic spatial distributions of the @xmath14- and @xmath76-related terms .",
    "dynamic balance between the transport enhancement due to turbulent energy @xmath101 and the suppression due to the turbulent cross helicity @xmath102 . ]    the notion of dynamic balance between the enhancement and suppression of transport should be compared with the notion of the dynamic aligment of the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.@xcite in the latter , basically a relaxation problem of the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with a finite flow under the constraint of the total amount of the cross helicity is argued .",
    "it is numerically established that the angle between the velocity and magnetic - field fluctuations decreases as the scale decreases ( dynamic alignment ) .",
    "numerical simulations are designed in the framework of the homogeneous turbulence without any inhomogeneous mean flow and the turbulence is sustained by the external forcing . on the other hand , in the dynamic balance argument , we treat inhomogeneous turbulence with mean velocity and magnetic - field inhomogeneities .",
    "these inhomogeneities in the mean fields are the main sources of the turbulent mhd energy and the turbulent cross helicity",
    ".    we should also remark the following points.@xcite    first , the relationship between the magnitude of the turbulent emf @xmath103 and the turbulent cross helicity @xmath104 is not so simple .",
    "the turbulent electromotive force ( emf ) @xmath103 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : emf_def ] ) ] is the most important quantity representing the turbulence effects on the mean magnetic - field evolution . in relation to the turbulent cross helicity @xmath105",
    ", it is often argued that the cross helicity should be small in situations where the turbulence plays an important role in transport through the emf .",
    "this argument is simply based on the fact that the turbulent cross helicity represents the cosine of @xmath106 and @xmath107 while the turbulent emf does sine of them : @xmath108 however , the situation in general is not so simple since both emf and turbulent cross helicity are statistically averaged quantities and the cross helicity is not a positive - definite quantity .",
    "this point can be easily seen if we consider a case where the turbulent velocity and magnetic fields are totally aligned but the numbers of positive and negative alignments are completely equivalent . in this `` balanced '' turbulence case ,",
    "the turbulent emf vanishes ( @xmath109 ) due to the alignment . at the same time , the cross helicity vanishes ( @xmath110 ) due to the equivalence between the positive and negative alignments . in this specific case , both the turbulent emf and the turbulent cross helicity vanish simultaneously .",
    "this example shows that the relationship between the turbulent emf and the turbulent cross helicity is not so simple .",
    "secondly , we do not require a large magnitude of the turbulent emf for the dynamic balance situation .",
    "the magnitude of the turbulent emf is determined by the balance between the turbulent magnetic diffusivity term , @xmath101 , and the pseudoscalar - related terms , @xmath102 and @xmath111 .",
    "if the turbulent cross helicity is large , the turbulent emf may be small or large depending on the balance with the @xmath101 term .",
    "thirdly , the normalized turbulent cross helicity @xmath112 represents the degree of alignment between the velocity and magnetic - field fluctuations .",
    "in addition , another normalized cross helicity defined by @xmath113 is of crucial importance if we consider the transport property of turbulence [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaled_cross_hel ] ) ] .",
    "the former is a measure of the topological property while the latter is the counterpart of the dynamical one .",
    "actually in the case of dynamic balance between the transport enhancement and suppression , the key quantity is not the alignment angle @xmath112 but the relative cross helicity defined by @xmath113 .",
    "the most straightforward approach to turbulence is direct numerical simulations ( dnss ) , where fundamental equations are directly solved without resorting any types of model . in order to resolve inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence with realistic boundary conditions",
    ", we have to use a huge number of grid points .",
    "the ratio of the largest scale in turbulence motions ( @xmath114 : energy - containing scale ) to the smallest ones ( @xmath115 : kolmogorov scale ) is scaled by the reynolds number @xmath116 as @xmath117 .",
    "this means that we need the number of grid points of @xmath118 to resolve all scales of turbulence motion . if the reynolds number is huge as in astro- and space physics phenomena , we need a huge number of grid points",
    "this is not available in the foreseeable future even with the present progress of the computer resources .",
    "turbulence modeling provides a powerful tool for treating realistic turbulence with mean - field inhomogeneities . depending on how much turbulent motion",
    "is resolved in the simulation , turbulence models are divided into a few categories .    if we solve large scales of turbulent motions with low - pass filter and modeling for small - scale motions , such kind of simulations and modeling are called the large - eddy simulation ( les ) and the sub - grid scale ( sgs ) modeling , respectively . in the les only the large eddies or large - scale turbulent motions",
    "are resolved .",
    "the resolved motion is called the grid scale ( gs ) one , and the small - scale or sgs motions of turbulence should be modeled .",
    "small - scale turbulent motions are expected to have more universal and symmetric properties than large - scale ones . as this result",
    ", the sgs motions can be modeled in a form simpler than the case of the reynolds - averaged turbulence model , where all scales of turbulent motions should be modeled .",
    "the simplest sgs model is the smagorinsky model , where , in addition to the filter width @xmath119 , only the gs velocity strain rate is used for modeling of the sgs viscosity .",
    "note that the filter width @xmath119 represents the largest scale of the unresolved motions .",
    "another type of model is called the reynolds - averaged turbulence model . in this model ,",
    "field quantities are divided into the mean and the deviation from it . in the simulation ,",
    "only the mean - field quantities are solved with turbulent transport coefficients such as the eddy or turbulent viscosity , turbulent diffusivity , etc .",
    "these transport coefficients represents statistical properties of fluctuation fields , whose motions are not resolved .",
    "unlike the large - eddy simulations ( less ) , in the reynolds - averaged model , all scales of turbulent motions are modeled using a few statistical quantities such as the mixing length , the turbulent energy , its dissipation rate , etc .",
    "these quantities are expected to represent statistical properties of turbulence motions .    in order to close the system of model equations ,",
    "the transport coefficients appearing in the mean - field equations should be expressed in terms of the turbulent statistical quantities .",
    "the simplest model is the mixing - length theory , where the turbulent viscosity is modeled as @xmath120 , using the mixing length @xmath121 ( @xmath122 : characteristic turbulence velocity , @xmath123 : mean velocity ) .",
    "depending on the phenomena , the length scale characteristic to the particular situation is adopted as the mixing length .",
    "typical choices are the dimension of the object ( for flows around a body ) , the pressure or density scale hight ( for the solar convection zone ) , the disk thickness ( for accretion disks ) , and so on .",
    "the transport coefficients appearing in the mean - field equations should reflect statistical properties of turbulence . in order to construct a self - consistent turbulence model",
    ", we have to properly treat the dynamics of turbulence simultaneously with those of the mean fields . in order to represent the turbulence properties , we need quantities that properly represent turbulence .",
    "in this sense , choice of such quantities is of essential importance in turbulence modeling .",
