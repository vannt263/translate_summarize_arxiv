    "the general problem studied here concerns conformal riemannian metrics of constant positive curvature with conic singularities on a compact riemann surface @xmath3 . for the history of the problem and its relevance to mathematics and physics we refer to @xcite .",
    "the goal is to classify such metrics up to isometry , in particular _ to determine for a given riemann surface , how many such metrics exist with prescribed singularities and prescribed angles at each singularity . _",
    "analytically the problem consists in the study of the liouville equation @xmath4 on the punctured riemann surface , with prescribed singularities at the punctures .",
    "if @xmath5 is the length element of the metric in a local conformal coordinate , then @xmath6 , and equation ( [ liouville ] ) expresses the fact that the curvature equals @xmath0 .",
    "the behavior at a singularity @xmath7 is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the local coordinate which is @xmath11 at @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the angle at the singularity .    here and in what follows we measure the angles at the singularities in _ half - turns _ , for example `` integer angle '' means an integer multiple of @xmath14 radians .",
    "an important special case is that of _ symmetric _ metrics , that is metrics which are invariant with respect to an anti - conformal involution which leaves all singularities fixed . in the case of the sphere , such metrics are in one - to - one correspondence with spherical polygons @xcite .",
    "so the problem in this case consists in classification and enumerating spherical polygons of prescribed conformal type with prescribed angles at the corners .",
    "every surface of constant curvature @xmath0 is locally isometric to a piece of the standard sphere .",
    "this isometry is analytic in conformal coordinates , so it admits an analytic continuation along every path not passing through the singularities , and we obtain a multi - valued analytic function @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the singularities , and @xmath17 is the riemann sphere .",
    "this function @xmath18 is called the _ developing map _ , and the length element of the metric is expressed in the form @xmath19 monodromy of the developing map consists of linear - fractional transformations ( rotations of the sphere ) , so the schwarzian derivative @xmath20:=\\frac{f'''}{f'}-\\frac{3}{2}\\left(\\frac{f''}{f'}\\right)^2\\ ] ] is single valued on @xmath21 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath18 near the conic singularities @xmath16 implies that @xmath22 $ ] has double poles at these points , with principal parts related to the angles ( see below ) . in the case of the sphere , @xmath22 $ ] is a rational function @xmath23 , and we obtain a schwarz differential equation @xmath22=r$ ] .",
    "general solution of this schwarz equation is a ratio of two linearly independent solutions of the linear differential equation with regular singular points @xmath24 in the case of the sphere , @xmath23 in this equation is a rational function with poles of order @xmath25 at the singularities , and the coefficients at @xmath26 are determined by the angles .",
    "the exponent differences at the singular points are the angles . after a normalization @xmath27 free parameters",
    "remain which are called _",
    "accessory parameters_. in terms of this equation , our general problem is equivalent to the following :    _ for given singular points and the exponent differences , how many values of accessory parameters exist , so that the monodromy group of ( [ ode ] ) is conjugate to a subgroup of @xmath28 .",
    "_    in the case of three singularities , there is no accessory parameter , the equation ( [ ode ] ) is hypergeometric , and the problem of classification of the metrics was completely solved for this case in @xcite .",
    "the case of four singularities corresponds to heun s equation which has one accessory parameter .",
    "the assumption that the angles are half - integer leads to the special case of the heun equation , which is equivalent to the so - called darboux ",
    "treibich  verdier equation @xcite , and which is easier to study because its general solution is meromorphic , and can be expressed in terms of abelian integrals .",
    "for @xmath29 , the existing results show that the general problem described above is very difficult , see , for example , the recent study of metrics with one singularity of integer angle on a torus @xcite , or classification of such symmetric metrics with four angles , at least one of them integer , on the sphere @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study new special cases .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the cases of four singularities with integer angles on tori and half - integer angles on the sphere .    in the first part of this paper",
    "we establish a relation between the metrics on the sphere and the metrics on tori , and restate the results obtained in @xcite . in the second part we study the simplest family which is not covered by the existing results , metrics on `` rectangular '' tori with angles @xmath30 . by the results of the first part ,",
    "this is equivalent to the study of symmetric metrics on the sphere with angles @xmath31 .",
    "we thank walter bergweiler and chang - shou lin for useful discussions of the problems considered here .",
    "we consider a metric of curvature @xmath0 on a torus @xmath32 with four conic singularities at half - periods , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and the metric has an integer angle at each singularity .",
    "let the angles be @xmath35 .",
    "then the developing map @xmath36 must satisfy the schwarz equation @xmath37=r$ ] , where @xmath23 is an elliptic function of the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , as is explained below .",
    "the general solution is a ratio of two linearly independent solutions of the equation @xmath41 the exponents at the singularities of ( [ 1 ] ) are determined from the characteristic equation @xmath42 whose solutions are @xmath43 , so the difference of the exponents is @xmath44 , and these are our prescribed angles of the metric on @xmath45 .",
    "monodromy of the developing map can not contain a parabolic transformation , so there should be no logarithms in the local solutions of ( [ 1 ] ) near the singularities , and equation ( [ 1 ] ) must have trivial monodromy at @xmath46 .",
    "in other words , all singularities must be _",
    "this gives three polynomial conditions on the parameters @xmath47 , see , for example @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , we have conditions on the accessory parameter @xmath48 which ensure that monodromy of ( [ 1 ] ) is unitarizable , that is conjugated to a subgroup of @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , these conditions of absence of logarithms are always satisfied if all @xmath50 , in which case ( [ 1 ] ) becomes the darboux  treibich  verdier equation @xmath51 for this equation an explicit formula for the general solution of ( [ 1 ] ) can be written @xcite .",
    "the monodromy coming from the fundamental group of the torus must be conjugate to an abelian subgroup of @xmath28 .",
    "there are only two kinds of such groups @xcite : the klein viergroup @xmath52 and a cyclic group ( finite or infinite ) . by a post - composition of @xmath36 with an element of @xmath28 , which does not change the metric",
    ", we can achieve that @xmath36 satisfies one of the following : @xmath53 or @xmath54 we call two metrics _ equivalent _ if their developing maps are related by a linear - fractional transformation .",
    "thus in the case ( [ b ] ) each metric is a member of a one - parametric family of equivalent metrics with developing maps @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "* theorem 1 .",
    "* _ suppose that @xmath57 in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "then in case ( [ a ] ) the metric is even , that is invariant under @xmath58 , while in case ( [ b ] ) each equivalence class contains an even metric .",
    "_    this generalizes results from @xcite , sections 2.1 and 5.1 .    _",
    "_ it is sufficient to show that @xmath59 with @xmath60 .    that @xmath36 satisfies ( [ 2 ] ) with _",
    "some _ @xmath61 is clear because the schwarzian @xmath37 $ ] is even .",
    "it is also clear from ( [ 2 ] ) that @xmath62 so @xmath63 is either an elliptic transformation with multiplier @xmath64 or the identity .",
    "if @xmath65 , the proof is finished , so assume that the multiplier of @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath36 is a meromorphic function , satisfying ( [ 2 ] ) , and @xmath66 where @xmath3 is a linear - fractional transformation .",
    "we claim that in this case the equation @xmath67 must hold .",
    "indeed , ( [ s ] ) implies @xmath68 and also @xmath69 using ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ ins ] ) we obtain @xmath70 which implies ( [ com ] ) .",
    "suppose that ( [ a ] ) holds .",
    "both equations in ( [ a ] ) are of the form ( [ s ] ) with @xmath71 , thus @xmath72 . using the first equation ( [ a ] )",
    "in which @xmath73 , we conclude that @xmath74 or @xmath75 , @xmath76 . in the first case ( [ idem ] )",
    "implies @xmath77 , so @xmath60 . in the second case ,",
    "we use the second equation in ( [ a ] ) which implies that @xmath63 commutes with @xmath78 , and conclude again that @xmath77 and @xmath60 .",
    "suppose now that ( [ b ] ) holds , and @xmath79",
    ". then ( [ com ] ) gives @xmath80 substituting @xmath81 to ( [ kwa ] ) , after simple computation we obtain @xmath82 and @xmath83 if @xmath84 , then @xmath85 so @xmath86 and @xmath87 . using ( [ idem ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath88 .    if @xmath89 , then @xmath90 , so @xmath91 and @xmath75 , and after multiplication of @xmath36 by a constant we obtain @xmath60 .",
    "finally , if we have ( [ b ] ) with both multiplies @xmath92 , then @xmath36 is an elliptic function , with @xmath93 , where @xmath63 is an elliptic transformation satisfying ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath94 be such that @xmath95 then the metric with the developing map @xmath96 is even .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "every even metric on the torus is a pull - back of a metric from the sphere via the @xmath97 function .",
    "thus we obtain a metric on the sphere , which has @xmath98 singularities at the critical values of @xmath97 that is at @xmath99 , and the angles at these singularities are @xmath100 .",
    "we call @xmath18 the developing map on the sphere , so that @xmath101 .",
    "now we consider four cases .",
    "* _ all @xmath102 are odd . _",
    "then the monodromy of @xmath18 is generated by four non - trivial involutions .",
    "* proposition 1 .",
    "* _ in case 1 , @xmath36 satisfies ( [ b ] ) .",
    "_    this generalizes a result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 0.3 ) .",
    "_ proving this by contradiction , assume that we have ( [ a ] ) .",
    "then the monodromy group of @xmath36 is the klein viergroup @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath104 be conformal involutions of @xmath105 with fixed points @xmath46 , @xmath106 their images in the monodromy group are non - trivial elements of @xmath107 , because all @xmath102 are odd .",
    "as @xmath107 contains only three non - trivial elements , two of the distinct involutions @xmath108 and @xmath109 have the same image , so the image of @xmath110 in the monodromy group must be the identity . but @xmath110 is a translation by some @xmath111 , so we obtain a contradiction with ( [ a ] ) , which proves the proposition .    in the remaining cases ,",
    "some @xmath102 are even , thus the metric on the sphere has at least one integer angle .",
    "all these cases were studied in detail and completely classified in @xcite .",
    "we state the results .",
    "* _ exactly one of the @xmath102 is even .",
    "_    let @xmath112 be the even angle .",
    "then it follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.2 ) that there are at most @xmath113 distinct metrics , and for generic torus there are exactly @xmath113 of them .",
    "the accessory parameters @xmath48 are found from the algebraic equation that expresses the absence of logarithms in the solution of the heun equation .",

    "@xmath117 is odd , @xmath120 , and the number of classes of metrics is at most @xmath121 with equality for generic tori .",
    "if three of the @xmath102 are even then all four must be even , because the product of local monodromies is the identity , and we obtain the last case :    * case 4 .",
    "* _ all @xmath102 are even . _    in this case , @xmath18 is a rational function with four critical points of orders @xmath122 .",
    "such functions were classified in @xcite .",
    "so in all cases 2,3,4 , we have a complete classification of metrics in question .    in the next sections we consider a special family which belongs to case  1 .",
    "here we begin to study spherical quadrilaterals whose angles are odd multiples of @xmath123 .",
    "we call them _ spherical rectangles_.    metrics on the sphere corresponding to spherical rectangles are symmetric with respect to a circle , and without loss of generality we may assume that this circle is the real line .",
    "singularities lie on the real line .",
    "consider the ramified covering of degree @xmath25 from a torus to the sphere , ramified over these singularities .",
    "it is a composition of an element of @xmath124 with the weierstrass @xmath97 function whose invariants @xmath125 are real .",
    "such weierstrass functions are defined on `` rectangular '' tori , which means that @xmath126 .",
    "the pull back of the metric on the torus has singularities with integer angles at half - periods @xmath46 .    in each quadrilateral",
    "we mark one corner .",
    "two quadrilaterals are considered equal if there is an orientation preserving isometry sending one to another and sending the marked corner to the marked corner .",
    "we usually choose the upper half - lane @xmath127 as a conformal model of a spherical polygon .",
    "then the corners @xmath16 become points on the real line , and the metric has the length element @xmath128 , @xmath6 where @xmath129 satisfies ( [ liouville ] ) .",
    "then the spherical polygon is a pair @xmath130 , where @xmath131 has conic singularities at @xmath16 and the sides @xmath132 are geodesic with respect to the metric @xmath131 .",
    "developing map of a quadrilateral satisfies the schwarz equation associated with a heun equation , as explained in the introduction ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our first result is    * theorem 2 . *",
    "_ let @xmath133 be the developing map of a spherical quadrilateral whose angles are odd multiples of @xmath123 .",
    "then there are two opposite sides whose @xmath18-images are contained in the same circle . _",
    "thus there are two types of such spherical quadrilaterals : in the first type one of the two sides whose images belong to the same circle ends at the marked corner , and in the second type such a side begins at the marked corner .    to state our main result we define the conformal modulus .",
    "let us map conformally our quadrilateral onto the rectangle @xmath134 , so that the marked corner is mapped to @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath135 is called the modulus .",
    "* theorem 3 . * _ there are two continuous families of spherical quadrilaterals with angles @xmath136 , and angle @xmath137 at the marked corner .",
    "one family consists of quadrilaterals of the first type , and the modulus in this family varies from @xmath11 to @xmath138 .",
    "the second family consists of quadrilaterals of the second type , and the modulus varies from @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",
    "each family contains exactly one quadrilateral of the given modulus in the described range .",
    "_    so there is a `` prohibited interval '' @xmath141 $ ] for the moduli of spherical quadrilaterals with angles @xmath136 .",
    "theorem 3 is proved in the next section .",
    "_ proof of theorem 2 .",
    "_ let us enumerate the great circles @xmath142 which contain the images of sides according to positive orientation of the boundary , so that @xmath143 is a residue modulo @xmath98 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath144 and @xmath145 are real and imaginary axes , then @xmath146 must cross the real axis perpendicularly at the points @xmath147 , and @xmath148 must cross the imaginary axis perpendicularly at the points @xmath149 . without loss of generality",
    "@xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "if the @xmath98 circles are in general position ( that is there are no triple intersections ) , then both @xmath152 and @xmath153 are finite , positive , and there is a crossing point @xmath154 of @xmath146 and @xmath148 .",
    "the centers of @xmath146 and @xmath148 are at @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "their radii are @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "then we obtain from the right triangle @xmath159 that the square of the distance between the centers is @xmath160 on the other hand the angle between the radii of @xmath146 and @xmath148 at @xmath154 is right , so the same distance is @xmath161 a contradiction .",
    "therefore the images of two opposite sides must lie on the same circle .",
    "the non - generic cases are easy and we leave them to the reader .",
    "this proves theorem 2 .",
    "let our three circles be the real line , the line @xmath162 through the origin making angle @xmath163 with positive ray , and the unit circle .",
    "the @xmath18-images of the two opposite sides lie on the unit circle and the images of the other two sides on @xmath164 and @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "we have one continuous parameter @xmath165 , and the modulus of the quadrilateral depends on the angles and on @xmath163 .",
    "the group generated by reflections in the @xmath18-images of the sides has a subgroup of index @xmath25 consisting of conformal maps ; this subgroup is the monodromy group of our developing map @xmath166 .",
    "the monodromy group is generated by @xmath167 elliptic involutions with fixed points @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , so it consists of the maps of the form @xmath171 where @xmath172 is any integer .",
    "when @xmath163 is rational , this group is finite , it is a dihedral group , and the developing map is algebraic . for this case",
    ", there is a theorem of klein ( see @xcite ) which says that the heun equation is a pullback of a hypergeometric equation with finite monodromy group .",
    "this means that the developing map factors as @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is a solution of the hypergeometric equation ( in our case @xmath175 is a conformal map of the triangle with angles @xmath176 onto the upper half - plane , and @xmath177 is a belyi rational function which can be computed algebraically ) .",
    "our monodromy group ( [ monodromy ] ) belongs to the class of groups considered by van vleck which consist of transformations of the form @xmath178 van vleck @xcite proved that fuchsian differential equations with such projective monodromy groups can be characterized by the property that they have two linearly independent solutions whose product is a polynomial .",
    "this remarkable property was first discovered by hermite @xcite for the case of lam equation , and generalized by darboux @xcite to equation ( [ dtv ] ) .",
    "it permits to solve the equation in a closed form .",
    "if @xmath179 is this polynomial , then two linearly independent solutions can be represented in the form @xmath180 hermite found the method of determining @xmath179 in terms of @xmath181 and the accessory parameter .",
    "equation on the accessory parameter comes from the condition that the monodromy group has the special form ( [ monodromy ] ) . in section 4",
    "we perform all computations explicitly in a simple case .",
    "to pull back our metric on a torus , we model our spherical quadrilateral on a flat rectangle , instead of the half - plane . consider the rectangle @xmath182 , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are positive and @xmath185 . now",
    "the developing map @xmath18 is defined on this rectangle and maps it to the standard sphere . without loss of generality",
    "one can assume that @xmath186 and @xmath187 , but sometimes we will use @xmath183 and @xmath188",
    ". then the developing map extends by reflection to the whole plane .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that the vertical sides of the rectangle are mapped by @xmath18 into the unit circle , and the side @xmath189 to the real line .",
    "then the developing map is real on the real line and satisfies @xmath190 which is a special case of ( [ b ] ) . to this one",
    "can add @xmath191 and similar properties for conformal involutions with fixed points at @xmath46 . if the angles @xmath192 of our spherical rectangle are @xmath193 ,",

    "are connected by some relation which also depends on the @xmath102 .",
    "thus we have the problem :    _ for given periods and given integers @xmath102 , how many functions @xmath18 exist ( up to proportionality ) that satisfy ( [ periods ] ) and have prescribed critical point pattern : critical points of order @xmath196 at @xmath111 and no other critical points . _    the schwarzian derivative of @xmath18 is doubly periodic with periods @xmath198 , and has double poles at @xmath111 , where we must have apparent singularities and the exponent difference must be @xmath102 .",

    "in this section we prove theorem 3 . we consider a spherical rectangle whose angles are odd multiples of @xmath123 ( measured in half - turns , so that @xmath123 means @xmath1 radians ) .",

    "the image of any side can not cover more than @xmath123 of the great circle to which this image belongs , otherwise this image would contain either a half - plane or the exterior or the interior of the unit disk . since the area of the whole rectangle is @xmath123 of the area of the sphere , it would follow that the rectangle is isometric to a hemisphere , which is of course impossible .    from theorem 1 we know that some pair of opposite sides is mapped by the developing map into the same circle . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that this circle is the unit circle .",
    "let @xmath202 be these two sides .",
    "they are oriented in the usual way , so that the rectangle is on the left of each side .",
    "the angle at the beginning of @xmath203 is the same as that at the beginning of @xmath204 , and it is either @xmath123 or @xmath137 .",
    "so we have ( at least ) two types of such rectangles .",

    "let the sides be @xmath205 in the order of positive orientation .",
    "without loss of generality , the image of @xmath206 is on the real line , oriented in the increasing direction .",
    "this image must be either @xmath207 or its complement .",

    "tracing the rest of the boundary we arrive at a picture in the top of fig .  1",
    ".    rectangles of type 2 are considered in the similar way .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "an alternative way to understand spherical quadrilaterals is through their _ nets _ @xcite . the developing map @xmath18 maps the sides of a quadrilateral @xmath209 to three transversal great circles on the sphere .",
