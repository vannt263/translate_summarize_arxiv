    "in quantum communications , one of the most important tasks is transmitting a quantum state ( known or unknown ) from one location to another location .",
    "the ideal channel for accomplishing this task is to share entanglement with a separated party for teleportation@xcite , but measurement is required to obtain the original quantum state .",
    "most recently , people has explored the new possibility to transmit a quantum state through a data bus with  always - on \" interaction , where minor operations are required . among such quantum state transfer ( qst )",
    "schemes , the protocols based on the spin chain with engineered couplings are particular attractive for short distance communication@xcite , as it does not require any gating , modulating and measurements .    however a real quantum system can rarely be isolated from its surrounding environment completely .",
    "it is usually coupled to the external environment ( also called `` bath '' ) with a large number of degrees of freedomcpsun2 .",
    "there are two distinct effects of the bath on the quantum system , quantum dissipation and decoherence .",
    "the difference between dissipation and decoherence is whether coupling between system and bath allows for an exchange of energy @xcite .",
    "the dissipation effect of a spin bath on spin transfer functions of permanently coupled spin system have been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the decoherence effects of the efficiency of the spin chain have also been studied in ref.@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite an assumption was made , that is , each spin of the spin chain was assumed to couple independently to separate baths .",
    "it is an ideal case .",
    "it is more practical to study the components of the system interacting with the same environment .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a system interacts with a spatially distributed globe bath by exchange interactions . here",
    ", the system is an artificial chain with engineered nearest neighbor couplings and the bath is generally treated as a collection of two - level state systems . through irreducible tensor method in angular momentum theory , we use the langevin approach@xcite to study the environmental effects on the efficiency of this qst system .",
    "we find that the transport efficiency decays exponentially with time ; when the norm of the amplitudes of the transport state are equal , transport efficiency is independent of temperature .",
    "but when the norm of the amplitudes are not equal , the transport efficiency is a decreasing or a increasing function of temperature respectively ; it also decreases as the number of sites increased .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we present our model for the coupling between the system and the bath . in section sec : langevin , we derive the time evolution of system with irreducible tensor method and the langevin approach . in section [ sec :",
    "effect ] , we investigate the the bath effect on the state transport in the first excitation subspace . in section [ sec : temper ] , we investigate the effect on state transferring at finite temperature . in section [ sec : end ] , we make our conclusion .",
    "the decoherence model we consider here is a n - sites lattice interacts with a heat bath by exchange interactions .",
    "the system for qst is an open chain with engineered nearest neighbor couplings proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the spinless fermion in a tight binding lattice is @xmath0 it describes the free hopping in a network of n lattice sites , which is equivalent to the xy - spin model . here",
    ", @xmath1(@xmath2 ) is the fermion creation(annihilation ) operator of electrons at @xmath3th site ; @xmath4 is the hopping integral over the @xmath3th site and the @xmath5th site . in the single fermion subspace of the lattice , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angular momentum operator for a particle of spin @xmath8 , scaled by a strength parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the single - fermion states @xmath10 are equivalent to the z - angular momentum eigenstates , with @xmath11",
    ". then through the time evolution driven by @xmath12 , a perfect qst is achieved at time @xmath13 .",
    "the bath around the open chain distributes as a large ensemble of two - level systems at different position without interaction .",
    "each position is represented by a site .",
    "the state of site is expressed as being empty or occupied by a spinless fermionic particle .",
    "this modeling of the bath can be realized as the background charge fluctuation for the practical electron system .",
    "the hamiltonian of the distributed thermal bath has the following form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the on - site potential ( or called the chemical potential ) of the @xmath16th site .",
    "@xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) stands the fermion creation(annihilation ) operator of electrons at @xmath16th site .",
    "and @xmath19 is the number of sites . by the rotating - wave approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian for the exchange interaction between the system and the bath is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the coupling strength between the @xmath3th site of system and the @xmath16th site of bath .",
    "obviously , @xmath22 describes the system interacting with a globe environment , which is more practical .",
    "the total hamiltonian of this entire system is described by @xmath23 which preserves the total number of excitations .",

    "this is typical quantum dissipation problem .",
    "not to be limited by the concrete initial states of the system , the langevin approach is used to derive the time evolution of the system operator .",

    "now we consider the dissipation effect at zero temperature .",
    "since the system and the bath are independent before coupling , the initial state of the chain and the bath is chosen to be factorized . as a state",

    "we denote the state of the chain as @xmath45 , where latexmath:[$%    the chain .",
    "we then investigate how the bath affects the state transferring from the @xmath44st site to the end of the chain .",

    "it shows that the transport efficiency decays rapidly as time increase , and it also become worse as the the number of sites increased .",
    "in this section , we consider how the spatially distributed bath affects the qst at finite temperature . since the bath is initially in a thermal state before coupling to the system , which is not a pure state .",
    "the mtf can not completely reflect the transport efficiency , as it lacks the information of state amplitude . here",
    ", we employ the fidelity as the criterion for transport efficiency .",
    "we consider the following situation : the arbitrary state to be transferred is prepared in the @xmath44th site , and it is a superposition of the single particle and the vacuum state .",
    "@xmath69 where the footnote indicates the position of the site .",

    "it can be obtained that the fidelity decreases as the number of sites increased .",
    "hence due to exchange of energy between chain and bath , we can not obtain the original state any longer as time increasing .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the decoherence problem in quantum state transfer ( qst ) .",
    "we show when an open spin chain of arbitrary length n interacts with a globe distributed bath , the efficiency of the qst decreases due to the exchange of energy between chain and bath , but the temperature effect on the qst is determined by the form of transport state .",
    "although our discussion are based on the in the engineered tight binding model with spinless bloch electrons , it also can be applied to an arbitrary many - particle state in such system .",
