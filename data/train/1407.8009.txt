    "indeed it is distinct from the quantile coupling but can be considered as its natural counterpart under the martingale constraint .",
    "moreover it enjoys remarkable optimality properties with respect to the natural martingale variant of the usual transport problem on @xmath16 , the martingale transport problem that was introduced in the context of mathematical finance in @xcite . see proposition [ synthese ] for more details on @xmath5 .",
    "one of our main results is that the operator @xmath17 is continuous .",
    "furthermore , we quantify the continuity with lipschitz estimates .",
    "let us emphasise that in close situations the continuity of a coupling operator may also be false . for this purpose , we consider the markov composition of two probability measures on @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath20 have respectively marginals @xmath21 and @xmath22 the markov composition @xmath23 is the law of @xmath24 where @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are conditionally independent given @xmath28 .",
    "as observed by kellerer @xcite , this composition @xmath29 is not a continuous operator .",
    "this observation provides a bridge to the next topic of this paper , namely the recent elaborations on a famous theorem established by kellerer also in @xcite . in the latter paper",
    "the author restricts the joint laws @xmath30 to a certain space @xmath31 of couplings and proves the continuity of @xmath29 on @xmath32 .",

    "because of the lack of continuity of the markov composition for left - curtain couplings , we can not apply kellerer s strategy to obtain the complete kellerer theorem .",
    "nevertheless we prove the markovianity and also the uniqueness in specific cases .",
    "we also provide examples of non - markovian martingales .",

    "we postpone the discussion of the overlap as well as the differences to the respective chapter .",
    "let us write a short summary on the martingale transport problem seen from the perspective of the modern theory of optimal transportation on geodesic metric spaces .",
    "a first remark is that the uniqueness of the minimiser @xmath5 of the problem is typical in the theory .",
    "it is usual that the minimiser possesses some structure . in particular , the usual shape is @xmath41 where @xmath6 and @xmath42 are the marginals of the problem .",
    "such structure results are usually called brenier  mccann s theorems after @xcite .",
    "the main result in @xcite shows a similar behaviour for continuous measures @xmath6 because the markov kernel characterising @xmath5 is concentrated on two points .",
    "this is the minimal support for martingales .",
    "the dual theory of the problem can also be adapted as explained in @xcite .",
    "mccann theorems are the first step toward further developments .",
    "the next step is to consider probability measures @xmath43}$ ] and in particular the _ displacement interpolation _ introduced by mccann in @xcite . in this interpolation @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are the given marginals of the transport problem . instead of considering the usual convex interpolation @xmath46",
    ", mccann considers the displacement interpolation @xmath47 where the law of @xmath48 is the optimal transport plan . in the martingale setting , this interpolation does not provide a continuous martingale . the search for an appropriate martingale displacement interpolation",
    "may be related to the skorokhod embedding problem .",
    "see @xcite for an approach to this classical problem using the optimal transport methods .",
    "let us now relate the optimal transport theory to the peacock problem , which is the modern name given by hirsch , profeta , roynette , and yor in @xcite for studies related to kellerer s theorem ( see chapter 3 and above ) .",

    "the paper is organised in three quite separate chapters .",
    "the type of results and proofs are different .",
    "nevertheless , lemmas introduced in part one are required in part two and the continuity of the left - curtain coupling , proved in part two is invoked for finitely supported measures in part three ( see the discussion before lemma [ lemlocal ] ) . in the first part",
    "we introduce several notions related to positive measures on @xmath16 .",
    "in particular we introduce the convex order @xmath55 and the extended order @xmath56 .",
    "we investigate these two orders as well as five other more or less classical orders on the space of finite real measures with finite first moment .",
    "we prove that they can all be formulated in terms of random variables and deduce relations between them .",
    "theorem [ echelle ] may be considered the main result of this chapter .",
    "we start chapter 2 with the definitions of the shadow projection ( definition [ shad_thm ] ) and the left - curtain coupling ( definition [ lc ] ) , and recall their main properties . the main theorem and more satisfactory result of this part is theorem [ lips ] .",
    "it states that the shadow projection @xmath57 is a lipschitzian map for the kantorovich metric @xmath58 .",
    "corollary [ doubidou ] is a reformulation of this result for the left - curtain coupling @xmath59 .",
    "another important feature of this chapter is the development of a new modified support @xmath60 in the theory of @xcite .",
    "it enhances the rough definition of left - monotone couplings that appeared in the equivalence between the three property for couplings : optimal , left - monotone or left - curtain ( proposition [ synthese ] in the present paper ) . with proposition [ car_etoile ]",
    ", it is now possible to determine whether a coupling @xmath19 belongs to this category only by considering the triples of points in a well - defined set , namely @xmath61 , while in the previous definition of left - monotone one had to show that _ there exists _",

    "the developments of the object @xmath65 enables us in theorem [ corstab ] to extrapolate the usual proof of the continuity of the left - curtain coupling ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.20 ) ) .",
    "however the quantitative theorem [ lips ] does not rely on it but on the important lemma [ ahyo ] , on the monotonicity of the shadow projection with respect to the stochastic order .",

    "it is the famous peacock problem of hirsch , profeta , roynette , and yor @xcite that we present extensively in the introduction of this chapter .",
    "our method is similar to that of by henry - labordre , tan , and touzi in @xcite .",
    "it consists of considering discretisations of @xmath54 and composing the transitions given by the left - curtain coupling using markov composition .",
    "the resulting process is a piecewise constant markovian martingale . letting the mesh of the time partition tend to zero",
    ", one may obtain martingale processes that are or are not markovian . in the final part we give some typical examples with several different behaviours .",
    "for instance in theorem [ poisson_fini ] the measures @xmath54 are assumed to be finitely supported and we prove uniqueness and markovianity . in proposition",
