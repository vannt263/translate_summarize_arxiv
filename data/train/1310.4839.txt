    "whispering - gallery mode ( wgm ) microcavities are at the frontier of research on subjects ranging from biosensing , nonlinear optics , and laser physics , to fundamental physics such as cavity quantum electrodynamics@xcite .",
    "contrary to its rapid experimental advances , numerical exploration of wgm s has been largely lagging behind with a limited number of available options@xcite . on the other hand , the beam propagation method ( bpm )",
    "has a long history@xcite in modelling light propagation along both straight and curved waveguides as well as whispering - gallery microcavity eigenmode analyses@xcite . compared to boundary element@xcite , finite element@xcite , finite - difference time - domain@xcite , and free space radiation mode methods@xcite , bpm remains highly efficient without sacrificing substantial accuracy . by adopting a perfectly matched layer ( pml)@xcite to absorb the light which is otherwise reflected at the computation window and following the procedure formulated in @xcite to correct inaccuracies incurred at the refractive index discontinuities in high refractive index contrast waveguide structures , the finite - difference beam propagation method ( fd - bpm ) can achieve high accuracy with a rapid convergence rate .",
    "conventional fd - bpm formulations are based on the fresnel approximation , where light is assumed to propagate close to the propagation axis@xcite . to overcome this limitation for bent waveguide modelling , high - order algorithms known as wide - angle bpm@xcite or the conformal mapping approach@xcite are desirable .",
    "alternatively , bpm may be reformulated in cylindrical coordinates systems to analyze such structures@xcite .    in this work , we simulated the light propagation in a wgm microcavity by implementing fd - bpm in a cylindrical system as shown in fig .",
    "[ cyl_coor ] . the field perturbation from a nanobead attached to the microcavity and quality factor degradation arising from cavity deformations were investigated .",
    "the computed field distribution correctly includes the radiative field component , which a mode analysis technique would fail to simulate .",
    "from the helmholtz equation , the field component @xmath0 of the te wave in a two - dimensional whispering - gallery microcavity satisfies    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the refractive index of the cavity , @xmath3 is the wave number in free space , and @xmath4 is the vacuum wavelength of the light circulating in the cavity . for a perfect wgm cavity with azimuthal symmetry ,",
    "the refractive index is independent of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the electric field can be approximated as propagating in the form of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the normalized @xmath9 azimuthal modal field distribution such that the squared norm @xmath10 represents the circulating power of the mode and @xmath11 is a complex constant whose real part @xmath12 represents the azimuthal mode order when the cavity is in resonance with the circulating light and its imaginary part @xmath13 characterizes the attenuation of the field in the azimuthal direction .",

    "when a certain wavelength @xmath14 yields an integer value for @xmath12 , resonance occurs .",
    "in addition , multiple wavelengths may yield an identical integer @xmath12 where eigensolutions @xmath15 correspond to resonance whispering - gallery modes with the same azimuthal order @xmath12 but different transverse modes .",
    "both quantities can be obtained from the nonzero solution of the mode equation , in turn described as an eigenequation with eigenvalue @xmath16 derived from eq .",

    "we will therefore drop the bar in the rest of the text for convenience .",
