    "wang - landau sampling ( wls)@xcite can be considered a well stablished monte carlo method , since it has been applied efficiently to many systems .",
    "nevertheless the method is still in development and new ideas have contributed to increase the degree of efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm .",
    "the method is based on the fact that if one performs a random walk in energy space with a probability proportional to the reciprocal of the density of states , a flat histogram is generated for the energy distribution . since the density of states produces huge numbers , instead of estimating @xmath0 , the simulation is performed for @xmath1 . at the beginning we set @xmath2 for all energy levels .",
    "the random walk in the energy space runs through all energy levels from @xmath3 to @xmath4 with a probability @xmath5},1)$ ] , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the energies of the current and the new possible configurations .",
    "whenever a configuration is accepted we update @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the so - called modification factor ) .",
    "the flatness of the histogram is checked after a number of monte carlo ( mc ) steps and usually the histogram is considered flat if @xmath14 , for all energies , where @xmath15 is an average over energies .",
    "if the flatness condition is fulfiled we update the modification factor to a finer one and reset the histogram @xmath16 . the original version of wls prescribes that simulations should be in general halted when @xmath17 .",
    "having in hand the density of states , one can calculate the canonical average of any thermodynamic variable as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the microcanonical average accumulated during the simulations .",
    "recent works @xcite have demonstrated that ( a ) instead of updating the density of states after every spin - flip , one ought to update it after each monte carlo sweep@xcite ; ( b ) wls should be carried out only up to @xmath20 defined by the canonical averages during the simulations ; and ( c ) the microcanonical averages should not be accumulated before @xmath21 defined by the microcanonical averages during the simulation .",
    "the adoption of these easily implementable changes leads to more accurate results and saves computational time .",
    "they investigated the behavior of the maxima of the specific heat @xmath22 and the susceptibility @xmath23 where @xmath6 is the energy of the configurations and @xmath24 is the corresponding magnetization per spin , during the wls for the ising model on a square lattice .",
    "they observed ( as in @xcite ) that a considerable part of the conventional wang - landau simulation is not very useful because the error saturates . in order to define @xmath25 to a given model",
    "one should take a representative size ( @xmath26 for the 2d ising model and @xmath27 for the homopolymer ) and find out when the corresponding canonical averages obtained from a few independent runs would come to steady values . in that study",
    "they concluded that @xmath25 should be @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the 2d ising model and the homopolymer , respectively .    in this work",
    "we propose a criterion for finishing the simulations which turns the choice of @xmath25 automatic for each independent run . as a result",
    "the simulated data become more accurate and one has no need to find out @xmath25 before initiating the simulations .",
    "from time to time during the wls the random walker pauses the simulation in order to check the histogram for flatness .",
    "the number of mcs between two checks is not relevant for the final resulting density of states , but it is interesting to relate it to the number of energy levels @xmath30 of the system . in this work we used @xmath31 for the 2d ising model and @xmath32 for the homopolymer .    applying wls to the two - dimensional ising model ,",
    "beginning from @xmath33 , we calculate the temperature of the peak of the specific heat defined in eq . using the current @xmath0 and from this time on this mean value is updated whenever the histogram is checked for flatness .",
    "when the histogram is considered flat , we save the value of the temperature of the peak of the specific heat @xmath34 .",
    "we then update the modification factor @xmath12 and reset the histogram @xmath16 . during the simulations with this new modification factor we continue calculating the temperature of the peak of the specific heat @xmath35",
    "whenever we check the histogram for flatness and we also calculate the checking parameter @xmath36 the idea of the proposed criterion is that if @xmath37 remains less then a determined value @xmath38 during this modification factor , then we save the density of states and the microcanonical averages and stop the simulations . in order to define which would be the ideal value for @xmath38 we first of all tested the range of variation of the temperatures . defining @xmath39 and @xmath40 as the minimum and maximum temperatures for @xmath41 independent runs for a simulation up to @xmath42",
    ", we can define the mean distance between two temperatures as @xmath43 for the ising model we obtained @xmath44 for @xmath26 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "since most of the values of temperature fall close to the center of the range , @xmath38 should be at least of the order of @xmath49 . nevertheless , as we show in fig .",
    "[ checking ] , @xmath50 is a more stringent , but a safer parameter .",
    "top of fig .",
    "[ checking ] shows the evolution of the temperature of the peak of the specific heat beginning from @xmath33 calculated for @xmath47 as a function of the monte carlo sweeps@xcite using the @xmath51 flatness criterion .",
    "the dots show where the modification factor was updated .",
    "the lower panel shows the evolution of the checking parameter @xmath37 during the same simulation . in this example",
    "one can see that if @xmath52 was adopted the simulation would be finished at @xmath53 , before the effective stabilization of the output . using @xmath54 the simulation proceeds up to @xmath55 .",
    "the dotted line shows what would be the results if the simulation would be continued up to @xmath42 .     for a single run .",
    "the dots show where the modification factor was updated .",
    "lower panel : evolution of the checking parameter @xmath37 during the same simulation . ]",
    "this criterion for finishing the wls has two main advantages .",
    "first of all it is not necessary to determine @xmath25 for a representative size , as prescripted in reference @xcite since it is defined automatically for each independent run .",
    "the second convenience is that different runs can proceed up to different final modification factors , depending on the evolution of the simulation .",
    "in order to test the proposed criterion , we performed wang - landau simulations of the two - dimensional ising model with @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , taking @xmath58 , and @xmath59 independent runs for each size , respectively , adopting the @xmath51 and the @xmath60 flatness criteria .",
    ".mean order of the final modification factor for each simulated size of the 2d ising model using the @xmath51 and the @xmath60 flatness criterions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     as a new application of the criterion , we consider a homopolymer consisting of @xmath61 monomers which may assume any self avoiding walk ( saw ) configuration on a two - dimensional lattice . assuming that the polymer is in a bad solvent",
    ", there is an effective monomer - monomer attraction in addition to the self - avoidance constraint representing excluded volume . for every pair of non - bonded nearest - neighbor monomers the energy of the polymer",
    "is reduced by @xmath62 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the model can be written as    @xmath63    where @xmath64 if the site @xmath65 is occupied(vacant ) , and the sum is over nearest - neighbor pairs@xcite .",
    "( the sum is understood to exclude pairs of bonded segments along the chain . )",
    "we used the so - called reptation or _",
    "`` slithering snake '' _ move which consists of randomly adding a monomer from one end of the chain and removing a monomer from the other end , mantaining the size of the polymer constant .",
    "we define one monte carlo step as @xmath61 attempted moves .",
    "we performed simulations for polymers of sizes @xmath66 taking @xmath67 independent runs for each size and finishing the process when the condition @xmath68 was satisfied in the course of the whole simulation of a modification factor , where again , @xmath34 is the last temperature of the peak of the specific heat in the previous modification factor .    in fig.[check_pol ] we show the evolution of the temperature of the extremum of the specific heat of a polymer of @xmath69 , beginning from @xmath55 . in the lower panel the checking parameter @xmath37 of the same simulation is displayed .",
    "the dotted lines are the continuation of the simulation for one extra modification factor .",
    "now @xmath25 varies from @xmath70 to @xmath71 for @xmath72 and from @xmath73 to @xmath74 for @xmath75 , for example .    in table",
    "[ table3 ] we show the mean order of the final modification factor for each polymer size .",
    "one can see that unlike the two - dimensional ising model , in this case the order of the final modification factor increases with increasing polymer sizes . adopting the proposed criterion for halting the simulations",
    "garantees that each particular run proceeds up to the real stabilization of the results .    in fig .",
    "[ cv1 ] we show the specific heat per monomer of the homopolymer for several chain sizes .",
    "the simulations were started from constructed ground state configurations@xcite .    in both examples of models discussed here",
    "we have obtained good results by adopting @xmath54 , but when applying the method to more elaborate models , such as the hp model of protein folding@xcite or continuous ( off - lattice ) models of polymers@xcite one should always observe the evolution of the canonical average for each new case , not excluding the possibility of adopting a more stringent parameter , such as @xmath76 , if the convergence is shown to be more unstable .",
    "we proposed a criterion to finish the simulations of the wang - landau sampling . instead of determining a final modification factor @xmath25 for all simulations and every lattice sizes ,",
    "the behavior of the temperature of the peak of the specific heat is checked during the simulations and the process is halted when this value varies bellow a given limit during the whole simulation of a modification factor . as a result , different runs stop at different final modification factors .",
    "we applied this technique to the two - dimensional ising model and a homopolymer and found that for the ising model the mean final order of the modification factors are roughly the same for all lattice sizes , but for the homopolymer the final order of the modification factor increases with increasing polymer sizes .",
