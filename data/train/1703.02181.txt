    "entanglement in multipartite quantum systems is a central issue in quantum information and quantum computation , and has received considerable attention from a theoretical @xcite and an experimental side @xcite . today we know that there exist other correlations than entanglement which can be embodied in the quantum state of two qubits  @xcite . from an entropic point of view",
    ", the total amount of correlations , quantum and classical , can be assumed to be described by the total quantum mutual information .",
    "the total quantum correlations are obtained after subtraction of classical correlations from quantum mutual information .",
    "the operational definition of classical correlations at the quantum level , lead us with the definition of _ quantum discord _ ( @xmath1 )  @xcite , a measure of quantum correlations .",
    "quantum correlations could be geometrically understood as a distance , in relative entropy , from a given quantum state to the closest classical state , differentiating explicitly the entanglement defined as the distance , in relative entropy , from a given quantum state to the closest separable state  @xcite . in the absence of entanglement",
    "a residual correlation can still be present in a separable quantum state given by the distance , in relative entropy , from the separable state to the closest classical state .",
    "this is the so called _",
    "quantum dissonance_. thus quantum dissonance is the correlation existing in the absence of entanglement .",
    "the research in this field has received a considerable attention since the discovery that certain computational task could be accomplished in the absence of entanglement @xcite .",
    "a prolific of scientific work has been dedicated to characterize , measure and the generation of states having correlations other than entanglement .",
    "elucidate whether or not there is a physical process under which correlated quantum states of two qubits could be created in the absence of entanglement is a fundamental problem we address in this work . in particular , the existence of a protocol to create states having a maximal amount of _ quantum dissonance_. the availability of such states should be important to accomplish computational task , not requiring entanglement , in quantum systems for which the availability of quantum coherent control could be a limited physical resource . finally we find numerical evidence that maximally correlated quantum states could be created for bipartite higher dimensional quantum systems in the absence of entanglement .",
    "the class of states we are attempting to generate have to be found within the set of separable states .",
    "in particular it has been defined the class of maximally discordant mixed states , which is a class of rank 2 and 3 states having maximal quantum discord versus classical correlations .",
    "the class of states thus defined are given by @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "for these states the entanglement is readily found to be @xmath4 .",
    "the class of separable states are those for which @xmath5 is below the border of separability given by @xmath6 . given that @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath8 is symmetric around @xmath9 reaching the maximum value @xmath10 .",
    "all these states belong to the class of dissonant states , that is the quantum correlations embodied in such states is only dissonance @xcite .",
    "let us briefly remind the main concepts involved .",
    "quantum correlations are defined as the difference between _ quantum mutual information _ @xmath11 and the _ classical correlations _",
    "@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the conditional entropy of @xmath14 given a measurement on system @xmath15 and the optimization is over all possible projective measurement on system @xmath15 .",
    "the conditional entropy for the case we are interested can be calculated using the ali - rau - alber results @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to find that for @xmath9 and @xmath16 the quantum mutual information is maximized and the classical correlations , minimized .",
    "that is , the incoherent superposition of three bell states @xmath17 correspond to a maximally dissonant state .",
    "other realization could be obtained by changing subpaces : @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the important issue we address in this work is the search for a dynamical process that could allow us to generate this class of quantum states without generating entanglement . from the state",
    "above , we guess that such dynamics should be conditioned within a portion of the hilbert space such that only three bell states are involved .",
    "we will use the notation : @xmath20 such that the probability amplitude evolves according to : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "it is not difficult to see that such equations evolves towards an stationary maximally dissonant state .",
    "the existence of this dynamics is conditioned to the restriction that no coherence is created among different bell states , and that the initial probability amplitude in state @xmath23 is zero . under such restriction",
    "the system of equations above could be written as : @xmath24 can this system of equations be originated from a dynamics of the lindblad form ? if this is the case , the selected bell states should be eigenstates of the operators included in the master equation , and the transitions between bell induced by the lindblad form should be restricted to this subspace .",
    "for completeness , it is no difficult to verify that any local lindblad @xmath25 $ ] with @xmath26 can not lead to eqs .",
    "( [ pro123 ] ) .",
    "since the bell states @xmath27 are spanned by the symmetric spin triplet , the lindblad form must necessarily include collective spin operators .",
    "one first attempt could be to consider a collective spin decay described by the operator @xmath28 .",
    "this operator connect states @xmath29 and @xmath30 , but state @xmath30 is connected through @xmath31 back to a combination of @xmath29 and @xmath32 , making this operator not suitable to lead to eqs .",
    "( [ pro123 ] ) .",
    "alternatively we can consider the cartesian component of collective spin operators : @xmath33 as can be directly checked , these operators have matrix elements between bell states in the symmetric subspace given by : @xmath34 they have the right matrix elements that could give rise to ( [ pro123 ] ) when the system evolves under lindblad form @xmath35 a more general situation would be that of a system evolving under a free hamiltonian @xmath36 and a lindblad with different decay rates such as : @xmath37+{\\cal{l}}_{\\gamma_x } ( s_x)\\rho+{\\cal{l}}_{\\gamma_y } ( s_y)\\rho+{\\cal{l}}_{\\gamma_z } ( s_z)\\rho \\label{total}\\ ] ] assuming that bell states in the symmetric subspace are eigenstates of @xmath36 , the general equations for the matrix elements of @xmath38 are given by , @xmath39 provided that state @xmath23 is not initially populated .",
    "this is the case when considering and initially unentangled state @xmath40 which in the bell basis can be written as @xmath41 . in this situation",
    "we use the normalization condition @xmath42 and then the rate equations become @xmath43 for example , when @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the solution has the following form @xmath46 that is , after a long time : @xmath47 which corresponds to the steady maximally dissonant state  ( [ maximal ] ) .",
    "this is also true whenever one of the decay rates @xmath48 is zero and the other two are different from zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the evolution of quantum discord @xmath49 and classical correlations @xmath50 are shown as a function of @xmath51 we observe that discord reaches and stationary maximum value of @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",

    "we concluded that maximally dissonant states are generated throughout an open dynamics involving collective spin operators . whether or not such open dynamics could be generated in the absence of quantum entanglement is the key question .",
    "a physical realization for such dynamics is not usual to be found in quantum optical systems .",
    "however , as developed in reference @xcite , such dynamics appears for a pair of impurity - bound electrons interacting with a bath of conduction band electrons in a semiconductor . in such case",
    "the electrons in the conduction band produce and rkky interaction between localized spins and an effective dissipative structure as in eq .",
    "( [ lindblad ] ) .",
    "it has recently been found that a dynamics with @xmath54 can be obtained for two qubits subject to independent noisy classical fields , that leads to maximally dissonant states as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the physical architecture behind the open dynamics in equation ( [ total ] ) actually needs the presence of an intermediary quantum system , for instance the electrons in the conduction band , whose degrees of freedom are traced out .",
    "this means that even when no actual entanglement is being generated between localized spins , entanglement has to be present in the interaction between localized qubits with the electrons in the conduction band . in order to clarify this",

    "notice that both , the two spins and the purification system are effective qutrits .",
    "this suggests us an strategy to prepare highly dissonant states of two qubits : the preparation of pure entangled two - qutrit state , where the first qutrit should correspond to a two - qubit system in a hilbert space of dimension three .",
    "a physical model where we can apply this strategy is the one consisting in two two - level atoms interacting resonantly with a single mode of the electromagnetic field in the tavis - cummings model  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for such system is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the frequency difference between the field mode and the atomic transition frequency .",
    "if we assume both atoms initially in the excited state , that is @xmath61 , and the field in a fock state of @xmath62 excitations @xmath63 , the evolution leads to the state : @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "this state corresponds to an entangled state of qutrits : the electromagnetic field mode lives within a three - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the states @xmath66 . on the other hand , the atomic populations oscillates also within a thee - dimensional hilbert space @xmath67 . in consequence , the dynamics provided by hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) results in an entangled state of two qutrits and then a highly dissonant state of two qubits may be prepared from this state . to see this ,",

    "it is not difficult to see that when no detuning is considered , the quantum discord still reaches a high value @xmath79 in the absence of entanglement .",

    "following the discussion , we can now study if the existence of these class of quantum states with maximal quantum correlation without entanglement are an exclusive property of bipartite states of qubits . to answer this question",
