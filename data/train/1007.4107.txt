    "detailed analysis of early - type double - lined eclipsing binaries ( debs ) in ob associations yields not only the precise absolute stellar parameters but also information about the association in which they are embedded .",
    "the systemic velocity of debs , when combined with their distances , allows us to determine the kinematics of the association .",
    "the evolutionary stage of the debs projects the age of the association , and the chemical composition of the components of debs gives the chemical composition of all member stars of the association under the assumption that all member stars are formed in the same medium .",
    "this valuable information was successfully obtained for a number of ob associations by applying modern analysis techniques on early - type systems ( i.e. among others , @xmath19 mus ( baki et al . , 2007 ) ; dw car ( southworth & clausen , 2007 ) ; ag per ( gimnez & clausen , 1994 ) ) . in the frame of a project aimed to investigate early - type debs in the vicinity of ob associations",
    ", we observed several debs in the vicinity of the cma ob1 association .",
    "some are found to be members and others not .",
    "lt cma ( also hip 34080 , hd 53303 ) is a relatively bright ( @xmath207.4 mag ) , short - period ( @xmath21=1.759535 days ) , eclipsing binary whose light variations were discovered with the _ hipparcos _ satellite ( esa , 1997 ) . to our knowledge",
    ", there is no detailed photometric or spectroscopic study of the system to date .",
    "claria ( 1974 ) reported the johnson colors of lt cma as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "otero ( 2005 ) comparing the _ hipparcos _ ( esa , 1997 ) and asas ( pojmanski , 2002 ) photometric data interpreted an apsidal motion in the system from the shift of the secondary minima .",
    "recently , lt cma is listed in the catalogue of eclipsing binaries with eccentric orbits by bulut & demircan ( 2007 ) .    in the present study",
    ", new high - resolution ( @xmath24 40000 ) spectroscopic observations are used together with all photometric data available from surveys of lt cma to reveal the apsidal motion rate of the system ( section 5 ) and the absolute stellar parameters of the components ( section 6.1 ) . a discussion on the membership of lt cma to the cma ob1 association on the basis of evolutionary properties is given in section 6.2 .",
    "the kinematical properties and the population type of lt cma are determined in section 6.3 .",
    "finally , we calculated the internal structure constants in section 6.4 for a comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "lt cma has been spectroscopically observed using the coud - chelle spectrograph ( ces ) at the 1.5-m rtt150 telescope of the tbitak national observatory ( tug ) .",
    "presently , ces gives spectra with a resolving power of @xmath2440000 and is able to provide 68 spectral orders between 3956 - 8772 in a single ccd frame .",
    "the detector is a sao ras 1k@xmath251k nitrogen cooled ccd camera .",
    "technical specifications of the ces are described by bikmaev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    in total ,",
    "14 spectra have been collected in five observing runs .",
    "the log of the observations is given in table 1 , where the hjd of the observation corresponds to the mid - exposure times .",
    "for wavelength calibration , thorium - argon lamp spectra were taken in the beginning and at the end of each run .",
    "each image was dealt with using iraf according to normal procedures of bias substraction , flat - field division , background - light subtraction and wavelength calibration . for the orders where",
    "very broad stellar lines such as h@xmath26 and he i ( 4471  ) are near the order edges , the continuum correction for these orders has been performed by means of dividing the order by the normalized continuum function of the previous or next order where no stellar lines exist .",
    "we have investigated the evolutionary status of lt cma in the plane of @xmath27 - @xmath28 and mass - @xmath27 ( figure 5 ) using the latest evolutionary models and isochrones of girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which include mass loss and moderate overshooting . assuming a solar metal content , we prepared a set of isochrones corresponding to @xmath29 and @xmath30 . from figure 5a",
    ", it can be interpreted that both component are consistent with the evolutionary tracks calculated for their masses .",
    "the primary star is evolved from the zams , whereas the secondary is still on the zams .",
    "the isochrones of 30 myr and 40 myr shown in figure 5a and figure 5b implied a mean age of 35(5 ) myr for the system .",
    "the age of lt cma derived here is much greater than that derived by claria ( 1974 ) for cma ob1 ( 3 myr ) , which rules out membership , when combined with the distance difference of lt cma and the association .        to study the kinematical properties of lt cma , we used the system s centre - of - mass velocity , distance and proper motion values , which are given in table 6 .",
    "the proper motion data were taken from the newly reduced hipparcos catalogue ( van leeuwen 2007 ) , whereas the center - of - mass velocity and distance are obtained in the present study .",
    "the system s space velocity was calculated using the johnson & soderblom s ( 1987 ) algorithm .",
    "the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 space velocity components and their errors are listed in table 6 . to obtain the space velocity",
    "precisely , the first - order galactic differential rotation correction ( drc ) was taken into account ( mihalas & binney , 1981 ) , and -10.33 and -0.90 km s@xmath12 drcs were applied to @xmath31 and @xmath32 space velocity components , respectively .",
    "the @xmath33 velocity is not affected in this first - order approximation . as for the local standard of rest correction , mihalas & binney s ( 1981 ) values",
    "( 9 , 12 , 7 ) km s@xmath12 were used and the total space velocity of lt cma was obtained as @xmath34(3.76 ) km s@xmath12 . to determine the population type of lt cma , the galactic orbit of the system was examined . using the n - body code of dinescu , girardi & van altena ( 1999 ) , the system s apogalactic ( @xmath35 ) and perigalactic ( @xmath36 ) distances",
    "were obtained as 9.61 and 8.35 kpc , respectively .",
    "also , the maximum possible vertical separation of the system from the galactic plane is @xmath37 pc .",
    "the following formulae were used to derive the planar and vertical ellipticities :        the planar and vertical ellipticities were calculated as @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "these values show that lt cma is orbiting the galaxy in a circular orbit and the system belongs to the young thin - disc population .",
    "the internal structure constant , ( _ @xmath42 _ ) , is a measure of the density concentration of the components of eclipsing binary stars with eccentric orbits .",
    "it is an important parameter of stellar evolution models .",
    "if the orbital eccentricity , the orbital and apsidal motion periods , the masses and radii of the components are known , the mean internal structure constant of the component stars in the system can be derived .                  here _ r@xmath52 _ , _",
    "@xmath53 _ and @xmath54 are the relative radii , masses and the angular velocities of the axial rotation of the components , respectively , and @xmath55 is the mean angular velocity of orbital motion . the first term in eq .",
    "6 represents the contribution of rotational distortions , and the second term corresponds to the tidal effects .",
    "it is well known that the observed @xmath43 contains not only the newtonian contribution to apsidal motion , which is due to the stars being distorted extended shapes , but also a small amount of relativistic apsidal motion .",
    "the theory of general relativity estimates the relativistic contribution to the observed rate as the following einstein formula ( gimnez , 1985 ) :              the observed apsidal motion period of lt cma @xmath60 = 69 @xmath18 5 yr , corresponding to a total rate of @xmath61 = 0.0252 @xmath18 0.0020 deg cycle@xmath12 was obtained in section 5 .",
    "the relativistic contribution to the apsidal motion calculated from general relativity is 0.00162 deg cycle@xmath12 or amounting to about 6% of the observed rate . after correcting for this effect , an average internal structure constant of lt cma",
    "is derived , with assumption of the periastron - synchronization , to be @xmath62=@xmath632.53 .",
    "the theoretical internal structure constants for the components ( @xmath64 ) are taken from the new evolutionary models of claret ( 2004 ) with the standard chemical composition of ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) = ( 0.70 , 0.02 ) . among the tabulated values ,",
    "interpolation for the masses and @xmath28 of the component stars of lt cma yielded -2.23 and -2.18 for the primary and the secondary component , respectively .",
    "the average theoretical value of internal structure constant was computed as @xmath67=-2.22 .",
    "this value seems significantly different from the observed value , in the sense that the component stars appear to be more concentrated in mass than theoretically predicted from the evolutionary models .",
    "there are several possible reasons for disagreement in the case of lt cma .",
    "perhaps the most important is the fact that the range of observations used to derive the apsidal motion period is small compared to the apsidal motion period .",
