    "among the local group of galaxies , m31 contains the largest population of globular clusters ( gcs ) and is the nearest analogue of the milky way . from the observational evidence collected thus far ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the m31 gcs reveal some striking similarities to their galactic counterparts @xcite .",
    "for example , both gc systems seem to have similar mass - to - light ratios , velocity dispersion  luminosity relations ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and structural parameters .    since the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "evolutionary population synthesis modeling has become a powerful tool to interpret integrated spectrophotometric observations of galaxies and their subcomponents , such as star clusters @xcite .",
    "such models , as e.g. developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , were comprehensively compiled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the evolution of star clusters is usually modeled by means of the simple stellar population ( ssp ) approximation .",
    "an ssp is defined as a single generation of coeval stars formed from the same progenitor molecular cloud ( thus implying a single metallicity ) , and governed by a given initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "gcs , which are bright and easily identifiable , and whose populations in a given galaxy are typically characterized by homogeneous abundance and age distributions , are relatively easy to understand compared to the other mix of stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "@xcite compared the predicted ssp colours of three stellar population synthesis models to the intrinsic broad - band @xmath6 colours of galactic and m31 gcs , and found that the best - fitting models match the clusters spectral energy distributions ( seds ) very well indeed .",
    "so , from the results of @xcite , there is evidence that the stellar population of gcs may be described by the ssps of stellar population synthesis models .",
    "in fact , many authors have used ssp models to study the populations of clusters across the entire age range . for example , @xcite simultaneously obtained ages , metallicities and extinction values for  300 clusters in ngc  3310 , based on archival _",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations from the ultraviolet to the near - infrared by means of a comparison between the observed seds and the predictions from the galev ssp models @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "using their sophisticated and extensively validated method , @xcite obtained the age and mass estimates for 113 star clusters in the fossil starburst region b of m82 by comparing the observed cluster seds with the model predictions for an instantaneous burst of star formation . @xcite and @xcite derived ages , initial masses and extinctions of m51 star cluster candidates by fitting starburst99 ssp models @xcite for instantaneous star formation to the observed seds based on _",

    "the extremely red colour of this object , combined with its apparent magnitude ( given in their paper as @xmath8 mag ) , was first noted by @xcite , who suggested that this implied that the cluster must be highly reddened ( @xmath9 mag ) and extremely luminous , @xmath10 mag .",
    "two years later , @xcite determined magnitudes of 257 gc candidates in m31 , including 037-b327 , in the @xmath11 photometric system . using his photometric catalog",
    ", @xcite studied the intrinsic colours of the m31 gcs , and found that 037-b327 was the most highly reddened objects in his sample of m31 gc candidates , with @xmath12 mag . in order to avoid any _ a priori _ reason implying that the intrinsically brightest gcs in m31 should also be the most highly reddened , @xcite argued that @xmath13 in m31 .",
    "based on a re - analysis of the reddening towards the m31 gc population in general , and to 037-b327 in particular , @xcite argued that the evidence for an unusual reddening law is ` somewhat less compelling ' than implied by @xcite s arguments . using low - resolution spectroscopy , @xcite also found this cluster to be the most highly reddened gc candidate in m31 , with @xmath14 mag .",
    "armed with a large database of multicolour photometry , @xcite determined the reddening value for each individual m31 gc , including 037-b327 , using the correlations between optical and infrared colours and metallicity based on various `` reddening - free '' parameters , and found @xmath15 mag for 037-b327 ( p. barmby , priv .",
    "comm . ) . using the spectroscopic metallicity to predict the intrinsic colours , @xcite rederived the reddening value for this gc , @xmath16 mag .",
    "although the reddening values of 037-b327 based on a variety of methods are consistent , this value is unusually large and therefore worth verifying using independent methods . at the same time , the large reddening value makes 037-b327 the most _ intrinsically _ luminous gc in m31 ( see details from * ? ? ?",

    "because of the key constraints we were able to place on the shape of the low - mass range of the stellar imf , and the fact that our photometric mass estimates are all within each other s uncertainty ranges [ with the exception of the result based on the @xcite imf ] , we predict that dynamical mass estimates will yield very similar results . unfortunately , there are no velocity dispersion measurements for 037-b327 available , however . using archival _ hst_/acs ( wide field camera ) observations in the f606w and f814w filters ( programme go-10260 ; pi harris )",

    "if we combine these half - light radii with the photometric mass determinations for 037-b327 , we predict ( using the virial approximation ) that its ( one - dimensional ) velocity dispersion will be of order @xmath4 km s@xmath5 _ if _ our imf assumptions are valid ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , spectroscopic observations at a resolution of @xmath59 ( e.g. , @xmath60  at @xmath61 , i.e. , in the calcium triplet region ) will be able to confirm our conclusions regarding the low - mass imf shape of this gc .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that 037-b327 is the current best example of a `` super '' star cluster come of age , and as such an important object for theorists to take into account when developing models aimed at describing the evolution of the ymcs seen in large numbers in nearby starburst and galaxy merger environments .",

    "the reddening towards this cluster , which we determine at @xmath65 mag , was also estimated by @xcite using the correlations between optical and infrared colours and metallicity , by defining various `` reddening - free '' parameters , and by using the spectroscopic metallicity to predict the intrinsic colours .",
    "these three different methods yield very consistent reddening values .",
    "the age of @xmath66 gyr for 037-b327 obtained in this paper shows that 037-b327 is a gc as old as the majority of the galactic gcs .",
