    "we start with the basic guiding example which corresponds to the rank - one case of our subsequent constructions . for a natural number @xmath9 , consider the set @xmath10 of regular bounded borel measures on @xmath11 which are radial , i.e. invariant under orthogonal transformations .",
    "@xmath10 is a commutative banach algebra with the usual convolution of measures . transferring this structure to @xmath12 via the mapping @xmath13 ,",
    "one obtains a commutative banach algebra of borel measures on @xmath14 .",
    "calculation in polar coordinates shows that its convolution @xmath15 is determined on point measures by @xmath16 with a normalization constant @xmath17 now , the above assignment defines a probability measure @xmath18 not only for integer @xmath19 but for all real @xmath20 , and it extends uniquely to a bilinear and weakly continuous convolution on the space @xmath21 of regular bounded borel measures on @xmath14 which is commutative , associative , and probability - preserving ( @xcite ) .",
    "the interesting point about this family of convolutions is that analytic properties which are valid for integer indices @xmath19 , due to their origin in radial analysis on @xmath11 , remain true for general indices where no longer any group structure is present .",
    "for example , consider the normalized bessel functions @xmath22 with index @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath19 is a natural number , then @xmath24 ( @xmath25 denotes the normalized lebesgue surface measure on the unit sphere @xmath26 ) , and the homomorphism property of the exponential function entails the product formula @xmath27 this formula , however , extends to arbitrary indices @xmath20 , see @xcite .",
    "the space @xmath14 together with the convolution @xmath15 is a prominent example of a commutative hypergroup , called the bessel - kingman hypergroup ( @xcite ) .",
    "a hypergroup is a locally compact hausdorff space @xmath28 together with a probability preserving convolution of measures on @xmath28 which generalizes the measure algebra of a locally compact group ; in particular , one requires a unit element and the existence of an involution on @xmath28 generalizing the group inverse in a suitable way ; for details we refer to @xcite and section [ orbithypergroups ] below .",
    "there is a rich harmonic analysis for commutative hypergroups extending the analysis on locally compact abelian groups . in particular",
    ", there is a haar measure , a dual space , and a fourier transform satisfying a plancherel theorem . in our example @xmath29 the dual space consists of the bessel functions @xmath30 and the hypergroup fourier transform is given by a hankel transform , @xmath31 this extends the fact that the fourier transform of a radial function @xmath32 is again radial and given by a hankel transform of @xmath33 with integral index @xmath19 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we generalize the bessel convolutions described above to a higher rank setting , where the space of `` radii '' is realized as a cone of positive semidefinite matrices .",
    "more precisely , we construct convolution algebras on such cones which interpolate radial convolution algebras on spaces of non - squared matrices .",
    "the setting is as follows : for @xmath34 and a natural number @xmath3 consider the space @xmath35 of @xmath36 matrices over one of the division algebras @xmath0 or the quaternions @xmath1 .",
    "it has the structure of a euclidean vector space with scalar product @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "a function ( or measure ) on @xmath39 is called radial if it is invariant under the action of the unitary group @xmath40 on @xmath39 by left multiplication , @xmath41 observe that this action is via orthogonal transformations , and that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are contained in the same @xmath44-orbit if and only if @xmath45 .",
    "thus the space of @xmath44-orbits is naturally parametrized by the cone @xmath46 of positive semidefinite @xmath47-matrices over @xmath8 . if @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then @xmath50 coincides with the nonnegative real line @xmath14 and radiality is equivalent to rotational invariance in @xmath11 . generalizing the classical case",
    ", there is a radial harmonic analysis on @xmath39 which is based on polar coordinates with @xmath51 as radial part and the stiefel manifold @xmath52 as a transversal manifold . in @xcite ,",
    "this is developed to some extent within the general framework of analysis on symmetric cones .",
    "indeed , the open cone @xmath53 is a symmetric cone within the space @xmath54 of hermitian @xmath47 matrices over @xmath8 which carries a natural euclidean jordan algebra structure of rank @xmath55 ; see section [ anasymm ] for details .    for each integer @xmath56",
    ", we interpret radial analysis on @xmath39 in the concise context of a commutative `` orbit hypergroup '' convolution on the cone @xmath51 which is derived from the orbit structure w.r.t .",
    "the action of @xmath44 on @xmath39 .",
    "similar to the rank - one case , the characters of this hypergroup , i.e. the multiplicative functions which make up the dual , are obtained by taking the means of the characters on @xmath39  usual exponential functions  over the stiefel manifold .",
    "this implies that they are given in terms of bessel functions @xmath57 on the cone @xmath51 with ( half ) integer index @xmath58 , where @xmath59 the bessel function of index @xmath60 is a hypergeometric series of the form @xmath61 here the summation goes over all partitions @xmath62 , @xmath63 is a generalized pochhammer symbol , and the @xmath64 are renormalized versions of the so - called spherical polynomials associated with the underlying cone .",

    "the multiplicativity of the bessel functions ( @xmath58 ) with respect to the orbit convolution on @xmath51 expresses itself in a positive product formula . under the technical condition @xmath68",
    ", this product formula can be written in a way which allows analytic continuation with respect to the index @xmath60 .",
    "we thus obtain a positive product formula for all bessel functions with index @xmath69 and an associated continuous series of hypergroup structures @xmath70 on the cone @xmath51 whose dual is given by the functions @xmath71 actually , each hypergroup @xmath72 is self - dual in a natural way ; the neutral element is @xmath73 and the involution is the identity mapping . for matrix cones ,",
    "the hankel transform of @xcite can now be identified with the @xmath74-fourier transform on the underlying hypergroup ; but in addition to the results of @xcite , it is also ( and primarily ) defined as a fourier transform on an @xmath75-convolution algebra .    before continuing with structural aspects , let us spend some words on bessel functions of matrix argument .",
    "they trace back to ideas of bochner and the fundamental work of herz @xcite and constantine @xcite in the real case .",
    "much of the interest in these functions is motivated by questions in number theory and multivariate statistics .",
    "in particular , they occur naturally in relation with non - central wishart distributions , which generalize non - central @xmath76-distributions to the higher rank case , see @xcite and @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "bessel functions of matrix argument are imbedded into rich theories of multivariable special functions .",
    "first , they can be considered the @xmath77 class among general @xmath78-hypergeometric functions of matrix argument , where hypergeometric series are defined in terms of the spherical polynomials ; see @xcite as well as @xcite for an introduction .",
    "second , all this can be done in the general setting of abstract jordan algebras and symmetric cones , see @xcite . in any case , the spherical polynomials depend only on the eigenvalues of their argument . considered as functions of the spectra",
    ", they can be identified with jack polynomials of a certain index depending on the underlying cone ; this was first observed by macdonald @xcite .",
    "there is a natural theory of hypergeometric expansions in terms of jack polynomials ( see @xcite ) which encompasses the theory on symmetric cones .",
    "finally , hypergeometric expansions of such kind are intimately related to the modern theory of hypergeometric functions associated with root systems as developed by heckman , opdam , dunkl and others . as functions of the spectra , gaussian",
    "hypergeometric functions on a symmetric cone can be identified with hypergeometric functions associated with a root system of type @xmath79 with a specific choice of parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , bessel functions on a symmetric cone can be considered as a subclass of the bessel functions associated with reduced root systems of type @xmath80 in the sense of @xcite , which play a fundamental role in the theory of rational dunkl operators @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this connection goes essentially back to @xcite and is made precise in section [ connect ] below .    in the second part of this paper",
    ", we consider structures which depend only on the spectra of the matrices from the underlying cone @xmath51 .",
    "this amounts to assume invariance under the action of the unitary group @xmath81 by conjugation , @xmath82 the orbits under this action are naturally parametrized by the set @xmath83 of possible spectra of matrices from @xmath51 , the eigenvalues being ordered by size : @xmath84 @xmath83 is a closed weyl chamber for the reflection group @xmath6 which acts on @xmath85 by permutations and sign changes of the coordinates . via the canonical mapping from @xmath86 onto @xmath83 which assigns to each matrix its spectrum ,",
    "the continuous series of hypergroup structures @xmath72 with @xmath87 induces a series of commutative hypergroup structures @xmath88 on the chamber @xmath83 .",
    "the transfer is established by means of so - called orbital mappings .",
    "the convolution , haar measure and dual space of each hypergroup on the chamber are made explicit .",
    "in particular , the haar measure of @xmath89 is ( up to a constant factor ) given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 the hypergroup characters turn out to be certain dunkl - type bessel functions @xmath92 associated with the @xmath6-root system @xmath93 . here",
    "@xmath94 is a parameter on the root system which is constant on each subset of roots corresponding to a conjugacy class of reflections ; in our situation it is given by @xmath95 with @xmath96 the hypergroup convolution on the weyl chamber matches the generalized dunkl translation ( @xcite ) for weyl group invariant functions , and we have an interpretation of the dunkl transform as a hypergroup fourier transform .    in the geometric cases",
    "@xmath58 , the support of the probability measure @xmath97 on @xmath83 describes the set of possible singular spectra of sums @xmath98 with matrices @xmath99 having given singular spectra @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "further , the characters are just the bounded spherical functions of the euclidean type riemannian symmetric space @xmath102 associated with the grassmann manifold @xmath103 . for general @xmath60",
    "they are characterized , within the theory of rational dunkl operators , as the unique analytic solution of a so - called bessel system ; see @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that for arbitrary root systems and non - negative multiplicities , the associated dunkl - type bessel functions satisfy a positive product formula and can be characterized as the characters of a commutative hypergroup structure on the underlying weyl chamber .",
    "the three continuous series ( @xmath104 ) for @xmath6 obtained in this paper are , to our knowledge , the first affirmative examples beyond the group cases associated with cartan motion groups of reductive symmetric spaces .",
    "some background , together with further partial results , is given in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is a follows : in section 2 , background on symmetric cones and bessel functions on cones , as well as some hypergroup analysis are provided .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of bessel convolutions on matrix cones . in subsection 3.1 . , orbit convolutions derived from matrix spaces @xmath39 are considered . in 3.3 .",
    ", the corresponding product formula for the involved bessel functions is analytically extended with respect to the index , and in 3.4 .",
    "the associated series of hypergroup convolutions on the cone are studied . in particular , their haar measure and the dual are determined . in 3.5 .",
    "we analyse an interesting critical index .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the induced convolution algebras on a weyl chamber of type @xmath80 .",
    "they are derived in 4.1 . from the convolutions on the matrix cones and are then , in the two final subsections , put into relation to rational dunkl theory .",
    "in this introductory chapter we provide some relevant background on symmetric cones , in particular matrix cones , and about bessel functions on such cones . in the main part of the paper",
    ", we shall introduce orbit convolutions and their `` interpolations '' on matrix cones within the framework of hypergroup theory . as a preparation , a short account on the relevant notions and facts",
    "is included in the present section . for a general background on hypergroups ,",
