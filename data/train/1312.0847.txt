    "data points were collected in three temperature sweeps ; heating a , cooling b and heating b. representative elastic reciprocal space maps for the two runs obtained during heating are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5b3](a ) for the low temperature short - range ordered ground state ( 80 mk or 100 mk ) and for the higher temperature disordered state ( 400 mk or 600 mk , respectively ) .",
    "we observe that the absolute intensity of the ( @xmath74,@xmath74,@xmath74 ) elastic peaks in the second heating run is a factor of @xmath162 smaller , and that the overall diffuse elastic scattering background is somewhat larger compared to the first heating run .",
    "this indicates that a complex freezing process with several metastable states is likely at play at low temperatures .",

    "the feature at 450 mk does not coincide with the glass - like transition at 275 mk indicated by our neutron scattering measurements . for comparison",
    ", we also show @xmath94 data taken from the literature.@xcite , width=302 ]    to address these questions we performed specific heat measurements down to a temperature of 220 mk on a 33.8 mg single crystal sample , cut from the neutron scattering sample which was the focus of this paper and , as already mentioned , that of a previous study.@xcite figure [ fig : figure5b7 ] shows the measured specific heat of our single crystal sample of tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , compared with several other samples , both single crystals and polycrystals , taken from the literature.@xcite as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5b7 ] , we observe a relatively large anomaly in @xmath94 at @xmath96 mk , almost twice the @xmath97 associated with the frozen spin ice state characterized in this paper with neutron scattering . for reference",

    "clearly , the temperature scales associated with the results of these measurements are distinct . as this @xmath96 mk temperature scale is not present in either our neutron scattering results or ac - susceptibility results on tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 taken from the literature ,",
    "we conclude that while this heat capacity anomaly and its associated sample dependence are intriguing and potentially important phenomena , they do not seem to originate from magnetic dipole degrees of freedom in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , similarly to what has recently been suggested in yb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , our neutron scattering data on tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 in a magnetic field show that a small field of @xmath16 0.075 t applied along [ 1 - 10 ] is sufficient to destroy the short - range antiferromagnetically ordered spin ice state characterized by diffuse elastic scattering at ( @xmath74,@xmath74,@xmath74 ) positions .",

    "the details of the neutron signatures associated with the ( @xmath74,@xmath74,@xmath74 ) elastic scattering display some history - dependence .",
    "the appearance of the elastic diffuse scattering below 275 mk correlates with the opening of a spin gap of 0.06 - 0.08 mev over most of reciprocal space and concomitant weakly dispersive spin excitations extending out to @xmath160.2 mev .",
    "these excitations appear to go soft at the short - range ordering positions of ( @xmath74,@xmath74,@xmath74 ) .",
    "specific heat measurements on a piece of the same single crystal show an anomaly at 450 mk , consistent with other reports by hamaguchi _",
    "et al . _ and taniguchi _",
    "et al._. we observe no signs for an anomaly near 275 mk , indicating that different degrees of freedom are involved in the ordering process responsible for this specific heat anomaly in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the new neutron measurements we report on the temperature and magnetic field parametrics allow us to complete the @xmath6-@xmath7 magnetic phase diagram for tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 in a [ 1 - 10 ] magnetic field .",
    "we find the dynamic and disordered , cooperative paramagnetic phase , which generated much of the original interest in tb@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 , to be bracketed by a low - field frozen spin ice state , and a field - induced , long - range ordered antiferromagnetic state at high fields .",
