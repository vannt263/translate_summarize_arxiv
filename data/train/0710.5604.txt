    "the neutrino oscillation experiments demonstrated in the last decade convincing evidence for neutrino oscillations proving the finite neutrino masses and mixing . however , these experiments are only sensitive to the difference in the square of the neutrino masses , @xmath2 , therefore they do not provide information on the absolute scale of the neutrino masses and are not sensitive to the nature of neutrinos nevertheless , the detection and study of neutrinoless double beta decay is the only way able to answer the following fundamental questions : ( i ) neutrino nature ( majorana or dirac particle ? ) , ( ii ) absolute neutrino mass scale , ( iii ) type of neutrino mass hierarchy ( degenerated , inverted , or normal ? ) , ( iv ) cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "double beta decay ( @xmath3 ) is a transition from nucleus @xmath4 to @xmath5 and it can occur in different channels : ( a ) two - neutrino double beta decay ( @xmath6 ) with emission of two @xmath7 and two @xmath8 , ( b ) neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath9 ) with emission of two @xmath7 and ( c ) neutrinoless double beta decay with majoron emission ( @xmath10 ) with two @xmath7 and majoron @xmath11 ( massless goldstone boson ) in the final state . the mode ( a ) is a process of second order allowed in the standard model ( sm ) which has been observed for several nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , processes ( b ) and ( c ) are violating lepton number conservation by two units and involve new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the nemo  3 experiment ( nemo = neutrino ettore majorana observatory ) is devoted to the search for @xmath9 decay and to the accurate measurement of @xmath6 decay . for this goal , the experiment combines two detection techniques : calorimetry and tracking .",
    "such approach allows us at the same time unambiguous identification of @xmath7 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14-particles provided by a wire tracking chamber and energy and time measurements of particles with a calorimeter .",
    "the nemo  3 detector [ ] is installed and currently running in the frjus underground laboratory ( 4800  m w.e . ) in france .",
    "the experimental set - up is cylindrical in design , is divided into twenty equal sectors and with @xmath13 and neutron shielding it has about 6  m in diameter and 4  m in height .",
    "the tracking wire chamber is made of 6180 open octagonal drift cells operating in geiger mode ( geiger cells ) .",
    "it is filled with a gas mixture of 95% he , 4% ethyl - alcohol and 1% ar .",
    "the geiger cells provide a three - dimensional measurement of the charged particle tracks by recording the drift time and the two plasma propagation times .",
    "the calorimeter , which surrounds the wire chamber , is composed of 1940 plastic scintillators coupled by light - guides to very low - radioactivity pmts . the energy resolution @xmath15 of the calorimeter ranges from 6.0% to 7.5% for 1  mev electrons , while the time resolution is 250  ps .",
    "seventeen sectors of nemo  3 accommodate almost 10  kg of the following , highly enriched ( 95%  99% ) @xmath3 decay isotopes : @xmath0mo ( 6914  g ) , @xmath1se ( 932  g ) , @xmath16cd ( 405  g ) , @xmath17te ( 454  g ) , @xmath18nd ( 34  g ) , @xmath19zr ( 9  g ) , and @xmath20ca ( 7  g ) . in addition , three sectors are also used for external background measurement and are equipped with pure cu and natural te .",
    "all these isotopes are produced in the form of thin foils and are placed in the central vertical plane of each sector .    for the @xmath21 recognition ,",
    "the detector is surrounded by a solenoidal coil which generates a vertical magnetic field of 25  gauss . moreover ,",
    "nemo  3 is covered by two types of shielding against external @xmath13-rays and neutrons . finally , the whole experimental set - up is closed inside a `` tent '' , which is supplied with radon - free air from a radon trapping facility .",
    "radon is trapped and then decays inside a tank filled with 1  ton of charcoal cooled down to @xmath22c .",
    "this facility decreases the radon level of the air from the laboratory ( 15  20  bq / m@xmath23 ) by a factor of @xmath24 . the radon trapping facility has been operating in the laboratory since october 2004 .",
    "a candidate for a @xmath3 decay is a two - electron event which is defined with the following criteria : two tracks coming from the same vertex in the source foils , the curvature of the tracks corresponds to a negative charge , each track has to be associated with a fired scintillator , and the time - of - flight has to correspond to the case of two electrons emitted at the same time from the same vertex .",
    "in addition a threshold of 200  kev is applied on energy of each electron .",
    "finally , it is also required that there is no delayed geiger cell hit close to the event vertex in order to suppress background from @xmath25bi decay inside the tracking detector .",
    "the energy window of interest for the @xmath9 decay for both @xmath0mo and @xmath1se is set to @xmath26  mev and the complete study of background contribution in this window has been performed .",
    "the level of each background component has been directly measured from data using different analysis channels .",
    "the dominant background during the first running period from february 2003 to september 2004 , phase  i , was due to radon diffusion into the tracking wire chamber .",
    "nevertheless , during phase  ii ( since november 2004 up to now ) , the radon level inside nemo  3 has been reduced by a factor of ten thanks to the radon trapping facility .",
    "remaining low radon activity inside nemo  3 is due to degasing of detector components .",
    "the @xmath6 decay of @xmath0mo and @xmath1se is measured with high acuracy with nemo  3 .",
    "the obtained half - lives for phase  i data ( 389  d ) are @xmath27 \\times 10^{18 } $ ]  y for @xmath0mo and @xmath28 \\times 10^{19 } $ ]  y for @xmath1se [ ] .",
    "the half - lives for the other five @xmath3 isotopes have been also derived from data and are summarised in tab .",
    "[ tab : results-2nubb ] .",
    "measurements of this process are important for nuclear theory as they allows us to reduce the uncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) .",
    "[ tab : results-2nubb ]      in the case of @xmath0mo , there are 14 events observed in the energy window of interest while 13.4 events were expected from backgrounds for combined phase  i and ii data ( 693  d ) .",
    "the situation is similar for @xmath1se as 7 events are observed and 6.2 expected for the same period .",
    "thus , resulting half - life limits at 90% c.l .",
    "are @xmath29  y for @xmath0mo and @xmath30  y for @xmath1se . if using the nme from refs .",
    "[ ] , the following limits on the effective neutrino mass are derived : @xmath31  ev for @xmath0mo and @xmath32  ev for @xmath1se .",
    "we determined also limits for alternative models assuming weak right - handed currents ( v+a ) and the @xmath10 decay channel [ ] .",
    "all these results are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : results-0nubb ] .",
    "[ tab : results-0nubb ]    however , these results date back to 2006 because the nemo collaboration decided to perform blind analysis with mock data .",
    "we plan to open the box and update the results by the summer of 2008 and once again after the end of the experiment by 2010 .",
    "the @xmath3 decay of @xmath0mo to excited @xmath33 and @xmath34 states of @xmath0ru has been also studied with the nemo  3 detector . the obtained half - life for the @xmath6 decay to the @xmath33 state is @xmath35\\times 10^{20 } $ ]  y [ ] .",
    "this value is in a good agreement with previous measurements [ ] .",
    "in addition , the @xmath36 limits have been determined for the @xmath9 and @xmath6 decay to the @xmath34 state and for the @xmath9 decay to the @xmath33 state ( see tabs .  [",
    "tab : results-2nubb ] and [ tab : results-0nubb ] ) .",
    "the nemo  3 detector has been routinely taking data since february 2003 .",
    "the @xmath6 decays of @xmath0mo and @xmath1se have been measured with very high statistics and better precision than in previous experiments .",
    "the @xmath6 half - lives have been obtained also for @xmath16cd , @xmath17te , @xmath18nd , @xmath19zr , and @xmath20ca .",
    "no evidence for @xmath9 decay has been found in combined data for phase  i and ii corresponding to 693 days .",
    "the @xmath36 limits at 90% c.l . for different modes of this decay",
    "are summarised in tab .",
    "[ tab : results-0nubb ] .",
    "we obtained currently the best limits for the @xmath10 decay of @xmath0mo and @xmath1se    at present time , the analysis of the phase  ii data without radon is in progress and improved @xmath6 and @xmath9 results will be published in 2008 .",
    "the expected half - life limits for the @xmath9 decay by the end of the experiment in 2010 are @xmath37  y for @xmath0mo and @xmath38  y for @xmath1se .",
