    "the cepheid and rr lyrae instability strips ( iss ) are observed to be rich in behavior , as seen for example in the beautiful work of udalski ( 1999 ) , with stars undergoing single mode ( sm ) pulsations in the fundamental ( f ) mode , in the first ( o1 ) or second overtone ( o2 ) , or beat pulsations in two modes ( also called double - mode pulsations , dm ) .",
    "theoretical work has shown that for the galactic cepheids we have a good understanding of the f and o1 cepheids ( moskalik , buchler , marom 1992 , bono , marconi & stellingwerf 2000 , feuchtinger , buchler & kollth , 2000 ) and of rr  lyrae ( feuchtinger 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore the problem of dm cepheids and rr lyrae has finally been solved ( kollth , beaulieu , buchler & yecko 1998 , feuchtinger 1998 , kollth , buchler , szab & csubry , 2002 , hereafter kbsc , kollth & buchler , 2001 , hereafter kb ) .",
    "however some small problems remain , in rr lyrae ( kollth , buchler & feuchtinger 2000 ) and cepheids , in particular those with low metallicity ( feuchtinger 2002 ) .    as the stars navigate through the is their structure undergoes changes .",
    "accordingly , the allowed stable pulsational states change on an evolutionary time scale , and the stars need to switch their pulsational behavior . during some stages",
    "more than one type of pulsational behavior is possible .",
    "some of these pulsational states may be reachable , while other may not be ( because a finite amplitude kick would be required ) .",
    "stars can therefore be in a different pulsational state at the same place on the blueward and the redward tracks ( hysteresis ) , as for example in the case of cepheids and rr  lyrae .",
    "some classical cepheids and rr  lyrae have been observed to change their pulsational status on human time scales .",
    "for example , the pulsation amplitude of polaris has decreased dramatically over several decades ( kamper & fernie 1998 ) .",
    "changes have also occurred in rr lyrae variables ( clement & goranskij 1999 ) .",
    "the theoretical aspects of these mode switchings have been addressed in the past ( stellingwerf 1975 , bono , castellani & stellingwerf 1995 ) , but many of the questions that observations pose have remained unanswered .",
    "for example , observations indicate a paucity of low amplitude s ",
    "cepheids fundamental cepheids ( fernie 1995 for the galaxy , beaulieu , private comm . for lmc and smc ) , and no stars with low component amplitudes in the dm region ( beaulieu , priv .",
    "comm . , see figure 4 in buchler 1998 ) .",
    "a similar situation occurs for rr lyrae stars ( walker & nemec 1996 , walker 1998 , udalski 1997 ) .",
    "these deficiencies of small amplitude pulsators seem too large to be solely due to observational bias .    here",
    "we address the problem of mode switching in a novel fashion , by taking temporal evolution explicitly into account .",
    "hydrodynamical modelling , to be feasible , has typically decoupled pulsation from evolution ( usually called a quasi - static approximation ) .",
    "the decoupling allowed the calculation of all the possible full amplitude and steady pulsational states of a given model at any point along the evolutionary track , of a sequence of models .",
    "however , this quasi - static approximation can break down near the bifurcation points where the star has to switch from one behavior to another ( lebovitz 1990 ) .",
    "( a bifurcation point is where there occurs a qualitative change in the modal behavior ) .",
    "the reason is that , right at a bifurcation point , the growth - rate of a mode or limit cycle can vanish and remain small in the vicinity .",
    "this causes a temporal delay for the pulsation to achieve the full amplitude that the hydrodynamical modelling would suggest  _ the pulsational behavior is then controlled by evolution .",
    "_ in the following we make use of the amplitude equation formalism ( buchler & goupil 1984 , buchler 1993 ) which is perfectly tailored to the study of what is happening in the vicinity of the modal bifurcation points , and",
    "we show that there are observational consequences .",
    "we will be led to distinguish two different types of mode switchings that we label soft and hard . a _",
    "soft _ bifurcation occurs when the nascent mode starts off with infinitesimal amplitude and the growth - rate is also infinitesimal . at a",
    "bifurcation the stable fixed point disappears ( the current pulsational behavior is no longer allowed ) and the star is left looking for another stable fixed point ( another pulsational behavior ) .",
    "the rate of change of the amplitude is generally _ not _ infinitesimally small in this case . in ",
    "3 we will see examples of the two types of switchings .",
    "we first consider the simplest soft modal switching which occurs when the star enters or exits the is . without lack of generality",
    "let us consider the neighborhood of the blue edge where the linear growth - rate @xmath0 of a mode , the fundamental or the first or second overtone depending on the luminosity , changes from negative ( vibrationally stable ) to positive ( unstable ) .",
    "generically , in the vicinity of the blue edge @xmath1 varies proportionately to time , @xmath2 , where the origin of time is taken to be the passage through the blue edge .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 is therefore the stellar evolutionary rate of change of the linear growth - rate .",
    "this type of bifurcation is well known to dynamicists and goes under the name of supercritical hopf bifurcation ( berg 1984 ) .",
    "the behavior of the amplitude is governed by an _ amplitude equation _ of the form ( buchler & goupil 1984 , coullet & spiegel 1984 ) @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the instantaneous linear growth - rate of the mode and @xmath5 a nonlinear saturation term which varies little along an evolutionary track .    if the star were perturbed away from its quasi - static stable limit cycle amplitude @xmath6 ( as obtained from setting @xmath7 in eq .",
    "[ eq_hopf ] ) , it would return to it on a @xmath8@xmath9 @xmath10 time scale , over a few hundred pulsations , because the relative growth - rates are typically of the order of a percent inside the is .",
    "away from the bifurcation , the thermal time scale @xmath8 is much shorter than the stellar evolution time scale @xmath11@xmath9@xmath12 .",
    "right at the bifurcation , however , @xmath0 vanishes by definition , and it remains small in some neighborhood , so that @xmath13 for a while , and the amplitude does not grow .",
    "in fact the star must wait for evolution to increase the value of @xmath0 .",
    "only then can the amplitude catch up with its quasi - static value @xmath14 .",
    "it should be clear from this discussion that _ the evolutionary rate of change of the growth - rate @xmath15 will play a crucial role_.    let us call @xmath16 the time when the solution catches up , and @xmath17 the amplitude at that instant .",
    "we are interested in determining the dependence of @xmath16 and @xmath18 on @xmath15 , @xmath19 and @xmath20=@xmath21 .",
    "the latter is the pulsation amplitude at @xmath22 that arises because of noise in the star .",
    "the coefficient @xmath19 is time - dependent because of changes in the structure of the star as it evolves , but its time - dependence is small . in a later example of an actual rr lyrae model we include its time - dependence . here , we approximate @xmath19 as a constant . with the substitution",
    "@xmath23 we can then readily solve eq .",
    "( [ eq_hopf ] ) in the form @xmath24 where the last expression is the first term of an asymptotic expansion for the integral for large @xmath25 .",
    "the point at which the pulsation amplitude catches up with the quasi - static value can be obtained to a good approximation by requiring that the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq_et ] ) , which completely dominates at first , becomes a fraction @xmath26 of the second term ( @xmath27 turns out to be a good value ) . with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq_et ] ) this yields a simple transcendental equation @xmath28 @xmath29 a good approximation to the solution , when f is large , is obtained with the fitting expression @xmath30 finally we have @xmath31 . the quantity q can be re - expressed in terms of the maximum pulsation amplitude in the is , since @xmath32 . thus @xmath33 .    fig .  1 : temporal behavior of the pulsation amplitude after the star enters the is ( solid line ) , for the case of @xmath34 .",
    "curves are for three values of initial perturbation ( noise level ) @xmath35 .",
    "the dotted line represents the quasi - static amplitude @xmath14 that would be achieved if the pulsation could react infinitely fast to evolutionary changes in @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude scale is set by the choice @xmath36 .",
    "the thick dots correspond to the @xmath17 obtained with the approximation of eq .  6 .",
    "the dashed line represents @xmath37 for the middle value of @xmath20 .    the typical behavior of @xmath38 as computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq_hopf ] ) is plotted as solid lines in fig.1 for @xmath39 and for three values of @xmath20 ( from left to right : @xmath40 14 , 16 , 18 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 which scales the amplitude , has been arbitrarily set to @xmath36 . shown as a dotted line is the quasi - static limit cycle amplitude @xmath41 , namely the value that the amplitude would achieve if the system could react instantly .",
    "we have no knowledge of the intensity of the fluctuation @xmath20 in a star which represents the projection of the turbulent noise on the eigenvector of the mode . as suggested by the approximation formula , the larger @xmath20 is , the faster the amplitude grows ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "but one notes that the effect is only logarithmic and therefore a precise knowledge of @xmath20 is of little importance .",
    "_ it is the rate of change of the growth - rate , @xmath15 , that sets the switching time scale _ , the scale of the abscissa in fig .  1 .",
    "the three fat dots denote the @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the three values of @xmath20 as given by the fitting formula .",
    "it can be seen that they provide an excellent agreement with the numerical integrations of eq .",
    "( [ eq_hopf ] ) .",
    "the dashed line represents @xmath42 for the middle value of @xmath20 .",
    "when two ( nonresonant ) excited modes are involved eq .",
    "[ eq_hopf ] needs to be replaced by the two coupled amplitude equations for modes 1 and 2 ( buchler & goupil 1984 ) @xmath43 we have kept some of the quintic terms in these equations which are necessary in order to describe the observed modal behavior ( kb , kbsc ) .",
    "( earlier studies by buchler & kovcs ( 1987 ) had hoped to get away with retaining only the cubic ones ) .",
    "when the transition from sm to dm inside the is is such that the nascent mode starts with infinitesimal amplitude , as we assume in this section on soft bifurcations , then the behavior of this amplitude is very similar to the hopf bifurcation that we have just described .",
    "the reason is easy to see : in the vicinity of the bifurcation the amplitude of the finite amplitude mode ( say @xmath44 ) changes very little , and we can expand around this point which leads to an equation for the amplitude say @xmath45 of the nascent mode that is identical to eq .",
    "[ eq_hopf ] .    to summarize",
    "then , stellar evolution causes a delay of order @xmath46 during which the pulsation amplitude stays negligibly small , but after which it very rapidly achieves its quasi - static value .",
    "the time spent at the small intermediate amplitudes is therefore very small and the stars are very unlikely to be observed with such small amplitudes .",
    "the amplitude at catch - up @xmath47@xmath9@xmath48 thus also depends on @xmath15 , and when the stellar evolution is slow it will be large . finally , we note that the time scale and the catch - up amplitude are both insensitive to the poorly known noise level , typified by @xmath20 .",
    "a hard bifurcation occurs when , as a result of stellar evolution , a fixed point merges with another unstable fixed point , in a mutual annihilation .",
    "one can readily visualize this in an amplitude  amplitude plane ( see kb , kbsc ) , where the fixed points , stable and unstable , lie at the intersection of two loci ( curves ) .",
    "as  changes with evolution , the two intersection points coalesce and then disappear as the curves move apart . at that point the star has no choice but to look for another stable pulsational state to mew into .",
    "the new type of pulsation depends on the overall topography at the time , and is determined by which fixed point attracts the stellar model .",
    "one might think that the time to attain the new pulsational state is the thermal time scale @xmath49 , but it can be and it is generally much longer as we shall show in a realistic example .",
    "we note that for a hard bifurcation the stellar evolution time scale plays no important role because the amplitude growth - rates do not vanish and thus the time scale for amplitude change is always finite ( kbsc ) .",
    "let us consider first a redward evolving 6  cepheid that enters the first overtone is .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq_approx ] ) to estimate the minimum observable amplitude @xmath17 .",
    "stellar evolution calculations indicate that a 6cepheid variable evolves at a rate of @xmath50@xmath9@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 when entering the overtone blue edge ( alibert 1999 ) .",
    "linear models give a rate of change @xmath54@xmath9 @xmath51@xmath52@xmath55 , so that we obtain @xmath15@xmath9@xmath56@xmath57@xmath58 .",
    "the maximum growth - rate @xmath59 in the is is @xmath56@xmath60@xmath61 . if we assume intrinsic fluctuations of the order of @xmath62@xmath9@xmath52 , where @xmath63 is the maximum amplitude in the instability strip , we find that the @xmath64 in eq . 6 takes on values around 35  40 .",
    "thus we estimate that @xmath65@xmath660.1 at the blue edge , and that the pulsation amplitude stays negligibly small for @xmath16@xmath91000yr , and that it then increases very rapidly to a value 10 % of the maximum amplitude in the is . because of this rapid increase of the amplitude very few overtone cepheids with amplitudes less than @xmath67 should be observed near the blue edge .",
    "turning now to a 8  cepheid which evolves at @xmath68@xmath9@xmath51@xmath69@xmath70 ( alibert 1999 ) when entering the fundamental blue edge , with a @xmath54@xmath9@xmath56@xmath71@xmath55 we obtain @xmath15@xmath98@xmath72@xmath57@xmath58 .",
    "the maximum @xmath59 in the is is @xmath737@xmath72@xmath69@xmath61 .",
    "thus we estimate that again @xmath65@xmath90.1 near the blue edge , and that the pulsation amplitude stays negligibly small for @xmath16@xmath9800yr .",
    "cepheids evolve both blueward and redward .",
    "only that half of the cepheids near the blue edge will therefore be affected , namely only those that move redward and enter the is .",
    "for the same reasons , there should also be a ( 50% ) deficiency of cepheids at the red edge .",
    "furthermore at a given period there will be a medley of cepheids spread over over the whole is .",
    "consequently there should be an overall deficiency of low amplitude cepheids at all periods .    for rr  lyrae stars we deduce from dorman ( 1992 ) that @xmath74@xmath9 @xmath75@xmath76@xmath61 when entering the overtone blue edge . from our linear models",
    "we obtain @xmath54@xmath9@xmath77@xmath69@xmath55 which leads to @xmath15@xmath9@xmath78@xmath79@xmath58 . in the",
    "is @xmath59 is @xmath80@xmath61 .",
    "we thus estimate that @xmath81@xmath90.01 at the blue edge , and that the pulsation amplitude stays negligibly small for @xmath16@xmath9 5000yr .",
    "the coefficients of the amplitude equations ( [ eq_aes ] ) can be extracted from hydrodynamical simulations , as we will illustrate for a sequence of rr lyrae models .",
    "first we compute the stable pulsational states at selected values in the  range of interest . from these",
    "we extract for each model ( characterized by ) the coefficients @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",

    "( [ eq_hopf ] ) that was shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the major difference is that here @xmath15 becomes the rate of change of the linear stability coefficient of an f mode perturbation of the o1 limit cycle ( the floquet stability exponent ) rather than that of the linear growth - rate of the mode .",
    "one sees that , for dm onset as well , stellar evolution inhibits the growth of the pulsation amplitude for some 8000yr , much beyond the thermal time scale which is of the order of a hundred days .",
    "dm rr  lyrae ( rrd ) with small fundamental mode component pulsation amplitudes should be rare .",
    "an example of a hard bifurcation occurs in the second bifurcation for our rr lyrae model , marked @xmath93 in fig .  2 .",
    "the stable dm is annihilated by a second unstable dm and they both disappear ( figs .  2 and 3 of kbsc ) . in this case",
    "the star gets attracted by the f fixed point , and thus the pulsation switches to a stable f limit cycle .",

    "the gray scale indicates the log of the speed ( length of the velocity vectors ) .",
    "note that the typical thermal time scale is given by the shading near the origin .",
    "it is very apparent that all the trajectories get attracted very rapidly to an arc going from the @xmath96 axis to the the @xmath94 axis .",
    "this arc is an integral curve of the steady state amplitude equations ( known as a heteroclinic connection because it connects two different fixed points , the o and f fixed points . ) along this arc the motion is considerably slower than thermal .",
    "the transition occurs on a time scale of @xmath9100yr , very long compared to the thermal time scale of @xmath10@xmath9100d .    at the moment the dm disappears , the star finds itself at the point marked with a large square ( bottom graph ) , and",
    "it gets slowly attracted to the only stable fixed point , namely f. the pulsation slowly changes from dm to fundamental sm .    in the case of a hard bifurcation , the switching time , even though of the same order of magnitude as the thermal time scale ,",
    "thus can exceed it by factors of ten .",
    "finally we examine why the speed is slow along the heteroclinic connections that link the sm and the dm fixed points . in fig .  3",
    "one visualizes the location of these heteroclinic connections from the vector field .",
    "( they are shown explicitly in fig .  1 of kbsc .",
    ") consider now the two loci that are defined by setting the first and second of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_aes ] ) equal to zero , respectively . on these loci either the horizontal ( @xmath100 ) or the vertical ( @xmath101 ) speed vanishes by definition .",
    "these loci each emanate from one of the two sm fixed points , and both of them intersect the heteroclinic connection at the two dm points .",
    "the heteroclinic connection lies therefore very close to the two loci , especially near and in between the dm fixed points , and the speed @xmath102 must therefore also remain small .",
    "one also notes that , when both modes are linearly unstable , which is the situation we are interested in , the heteroclinic connection is always attractive sideways .",
    "this remains true _",
    "a fortiori _ when the loci intersect and give rise to a dm fixed point ( in which case the speed vanishes at the dm ) .",
    "note also that the linear stability root of the f fixed point along the @xmath103 axis is given by @xmath104 and , since @xmath105 is typically large the speed along @xmath94 is high .",
    "_ mutatis _ _ mutandis _ one shows that the speed along the @xmath44 axis is also high .",
    "although this only concerns the motion along the coordinate axis , fig .",
    "3 shows that it remains true in between .",
    "we have shown that there are two types of bifurcations with different characteristics .",
    "the first is a soft bifurcation where the incipient mode starts with infinitesimal amplitude whose growth is determined by the evolutionary rate of change @xmath106 of the appropriate linear growth - rate @xmath0 .",
    "this time scale @xmath46 can be very large compared to the thermal time scale @xmath10 depending on the stellar evolution time scale .",
    "the second is a hard bifurcation which occurs when the rug is pulled from under the pulsation , as it were , when the pulsation must change , because , due to an evolutionary change in the star s structure , it is no longer allowed or possible . here",
    "the time scale remains thermal , but generally with a large multiplication factor .",
    "this delay and then abrupt onset of pulsation has as a consequence that stellar pulsators with low amplitudes should be rarely observed , in agreement with observations .",
    "another interest of this paper is that it shows the possibility of obtaining valuable information about stellar structure from the observations of a star that is in the process of starting to pulsate or of switching its pulsational state . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will show how the combined use of numerical hydrodynamics , time - series analysis , the amplitude equation formalism and the knowledge of the stellar evolution time scale ( dt@xmath107 /dt ) allow one to compute consistently the evolution of a pulsating star throughout the whole is .",
