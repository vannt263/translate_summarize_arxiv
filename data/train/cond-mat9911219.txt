    "@xmath3 has attracted much attention @xcite , due to their similarities in crystalline and electronic properties , and , as a consequence , the feasibility of the fabrication of structures such as quantum wells , quantum wires and dots @xcite .",
    "for this reason , with the development of the technology of the molecular beam epitaxy , microstructures of dms / non - magnetic semiconductors , built with the constituents @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and the quaternary alloy @xmath6 , have been grown , and their magneto - optic properties have been largely explored .",
    "for instance , in structures built with a non - magnetic quantum well ( @xmath4 ) surrounded by dms barriers , the magnetic tuning of the barrier potential induces important changes in the energy of the confined states , which appear as large zeeman effects of the excitons in the quantum well @xcite .",
    "structures where the dms layer ( @xmath7)@xmath8 is surrounded by non - magnetic material ( @xmath4 or @xmath3 ) are also greatly interesting @xcite",
    ". therefore , it is worthwhile to understand in greater details the vibrational modes and the electron - phonon interaction in structures with these ii - vi dms . in particular , for the magneto - optic properties , as well as for the possible magnetic order , holes play an important role .",
    "we will give , in consequence , special attention to the hole - phonon interaction , considered here as being described by the same frlich - like electron - phonon potential , calculated with the proper hole parameters .",
    "the lattice dynamics of the bulk @xmath9 has been studied in detail , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "basically , optical phonons always play an important role in determining many physical properties in those materials .",

    ", the effect of phonon confinement and its consequences on the electron - phonon interaction in polar semiconductor heterostructures seems to be reasonably understood @xcite . in this paper , we will study the confinement effect on the carrier - optical - phonon interaction in two typical microstructures with a dms thin film surrounded by non - magnetic material : a @xmath10 double well structure ( in which case the @xmath11 layer acts as a barrier ) , and a @xmath12 single quantum well ( in which case the @xmath13 layer is programmed to work as a well ) .",
    "according to the dielectric continuum model @xcite , the optical - phonon modes of small wavevector in a microstructure can be obtained by describing them in several layers with different dielectric functions . in each layer the dielectric function is expressed by the generalized lyddane - sachs - teller relation , given in binary semiconductors by : @xmath14 and , in ternary semiconductors : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the phonon frequency .",

    "a saturation occurs after that concentration .",
    "the scattering rates for holes ( due to confined phonons ) , on the other hand , are stronger than that for electrons ( by a factor of 3 , approximately , in large concentrations ) , and , differently from the electrons , are weakly dependent on @xmath39 .",
    "the dependence of the scattering rates due to the interface modes on the magnetic ions concentration is , on the other hand , much weaker .",
    "our results show , considering the order from low to high energy in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , that only the 3rd to the 6th modes give significant scattering rates , both for electrons and holes .",
    "only the symmetric modes contribute to the intra - subband transitions and only the anti - symmetric modes contribute to the inter - subband transitions .",
    "our calculation , performed for each individual mode , shows also that , in the case of @xmath116 , the third symmetric interface mode dominates the intra - subband scattering rate , and the forth anti - symmetric interface mode dominates the inter - subband scattering rate .",
    "the 3rd , and the 6th symmetric modes generate almost the same scattering rates for the transition @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , but the 4th and the 5th symmetric modes give scattering rates for the transition @xmath125 , four times bigger than that for the transition @xmath122 .",
    "the scattering rates for the transitions @xmath123 and @xmath124 , due to anti - symmetric interface modes , on the other hand , have almost the same values at definite initial kinetic energy . with the increase of the @xmath41 concentration , the 5th and the 6th modes become more and more important . at @xmath126 ,",
    "the 3rd , 4th , and 6th symmetric modes give important contributions for the intra - subband scattering .",
    "the same occurs for the 4th , 5th , and the 6th anti - symmetric modes , for the inter - subband scattering . in the case of holes ,",
    "the most remarkable difference with the electron scattering rates is that the 4th interface phonon mode gives a greatly enhanced contribution . besides , the hole scattering rate due to the 3rd and the 6th interface modes show an obvious increase with the increase of hole energy , for intra - subband transitions .",
    "next , we consider the electron ( hole ) phonon interaction in a ternary / ternary @xmath127 single well , where the dms layer works as a well ( after the proper choice of @xmath128 ) .",
    "the phonon modes in this structure can be obtained in the same way as that for a binary / binary single well@xcite , by just substituting the dielectric function of the binary compound ( eq . [ diel1 ] ) the dielectric function of the ternary alloy ( eq . [ diel2 ] ) .",
    "the number of phonon modes in ternary / ternary single well is twice that in a binary / binary single well . in fig .",

    "[ fig06 ] . according to our calculation for individual modes , in the case ( i )",
    "the @xmath4-like modes give the major contribution among the confined modes . in the case ( ii ) , the @xmath118-like modes dominate .",
    "the anti - symmetric interface modes give scattering rates ten times smaller than the symmetric modes .",
    "the contribution from the lowest energy interface mode is negligeable comparing to other modes .",
    "our calculation is performed at t=0 , and we have only considered the scattering assisted by the emission of optic modes .",
    "for that reason , in some cases , the scattering rate is zero below a certain energy threshold , corresponding to a minimum energy transfer equal to the energy of the lowest lying relevant optic vibrational mode .",
    "for the same reason , a saw - like structure may appear in the total scattering rates due to the emission of interface modes .",
    "the results obtained by using the parameters of the double well structure , shows no threshold for the @xmath124 transition for electrons , because the energy difference between the bottom of the subbands is higher than the energy of the lowest lying relevant mode . a remarkable result , which is a consequence of the widths chosen for the wells and barrier , is that the interface modes dominate the electron scattering in the whole range of the magnetic ion concentration , whereas the confined modes dominate the low energy hole scattering in the intermediate and high magnetic ion concentration .",
    "contrarily to the case of the double well , in the ternary / ternary single well structure , for both choices of composition , there is just a weak dependence of the transition rates on the concentrations @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact in structures those structures the barrier height did not change , because we took care of keeping the dms material as the well .",
    "the differences on the scattering rates reflects , in this case , the changes on the optic phonon dispersion relations . as in the case of the double well structure ,",
    "the scattering by interface phonons dominate the intra - subband electron transition . in what concerns the inter - subband , however , almost an order of magnitude weaker , it is hard to distinguish between the contributions due to the interfaces from those of the confined modes .",
    "we had to use arrows indicating each mode , in that case . for holes , above an initial kinetic energy just a few ev above the energy threshold , the intra - subband scattering rates are dominated by the interface modes , as in the case of electrons .",
    "however , the inter - subband transitions are dominated by the confined phonons .    in summary , employing the @xmath83 model to calculate the optical phonon modes in bulk ternary alloy @xmath11 and @xmath96 , and , after that the dielectric function of those material in the energy range of @xmath138 , we studied the confinement of optical phonon modes in binary / ternary double well and ternary / ternary single well structures within the framework of dielectric continuum model .",
