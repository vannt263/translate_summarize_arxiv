    "large cluster surveys like the spt , act , planck and erosita promise to detect from a thousand to a few hundred thousand clusters in the coming decade .",
    "the abundance and redshift distribution @xmath3 of these clusters are important probes to understand the nature of dark energy as well as to constrain other cosmological parameters like @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . to deduce a cosmology from these @xmath3 observations ,",
    "one requires a precise knowledge of the limiting mass of the survey as a function of redshift .",
    "one frequently uses proxy observables such as x - ray surface brightness and temperature @xcite , sunyaev zeldovich effect ( sze ) decrement @xcite , cluster richness @xcite and lensing @xcite for the masses of clusters , related through simple power - law scaling relations .",
    "these scaling parameters are highly degenerate with the cosmological parameters , and breaking this degeneracy is crucial to obtain tight constraints on cosmology .",
    "this may realized , for example , through the so called ` self - calibration ' techniques @xcite .",
    "other approaches include an ` unbiased ' mass follow - up of a sub - sample of the survey clusters @xcite or better theoretical modeling of clusters to predict the form of mass - observable scaling relation @xcite .",
    "one can also try to optimize the cluster surveys so as to get the best possible survey yield @xcite .",
    "measurement of the angular diameter distance , @xmath4 , at the redshift of the cluster using a combination of sze and x - ray observations have been routinely made over the last 30 years .",
    "the results have suffered , in the past , from various systematics and reliable estimates have only been achieved recently with analysis of statistically significant samples of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "these new observations have demonstrated the power of using clusters to measure ` @xmath4 vs @xmath5 ' and use it to study the expansion history of our universe @xcite .",
    "however , these recent progress has been done with targeted observations . since",
    ", targeted observations are costly , this approach limits the size of the sample of @xmath6 . in this _",
    ", we show that one can build up an ` ensemble ' of by picking a sub - sample of clusters discovered in both x - ray and sze surveys with overlapping area and redshift coverage . since",
    ", the surveys are already geared towards getting clusters for @xmath3 , we get the without any _ extra _ targeted observations .",
    "addition of to helps in tightening cosmological constraints , especially on dark energy equation of state .",
    "this is not surprising , since using from clusters is akin to adding @xmath0 information from supernovae ( sne ) observations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   2 ,",
    "we briefly discuss cluster number counts and the procedure to estimate from sze + x - ray observations ; in ",
    "3 we describe the surveys , the choice of cosmological and cluster models and also summarize our methodology ; in   4 , we forecast constraints on cosmological parameters ; and finally , we conclude in   5 .",
    "[ fig : mocking ]    the redshift distribution of detectable clusters is given by , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the co - moving volume element , @xmath9 is the cluster selection function incorporating a logarithmic scatter in the luminosity to mass conversion and @xmath10 is the halo mass function taken from simulations @xcite . for a x - ray / sze survey",
    "the limiting mass @xmath11 is found from flux limit , @xmath12 , of the survey . for x - ray survey",
    ", we adopt luminosity - mass relations from @xcite given by @xmath13 . for an sze survey , our sze flux - mass relation is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the integrated sze distortion and is in mpc .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 mimics any ` non - standard ' evolution of cluster scaling relations @xcite . for the x - ray survey ,",
    "our fiducial parameter values are : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with a log - normal scatter of 0.246 ; while the corresponding values for the sze scaling relation are : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 with a log - normal scatter of 0.2 .",
    "the distance @xmath23 , of a cluster observed at a redshift @xmath5 depends on the expansion history of the universe as , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hubble expansion .",
    "the seminal paper by @xcite defines the procedure to measure from observations of clusters in sze + x - ray .",
    "this depends on ` assuming ' a profile for the intra - cluster medium , icm , typically taken to be an isothermal @xmath26-profile - profile , this leads to bias and scatter .",
    "the impact is less for ensemble of clusters .",
    "moreover , the uncertainty can be calibrated to first order using cluster simulations . ] with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the electron number density , @xmath29 is the radius from the cluster s center , @xmath30 is the core radius , and @xmath26 is a power - law index .",
    "note , that one can always use a more realistic icm model with better data .",
    "for example , one can fit a temperature profile to improve upon the errors .",
    "the x - ray brightness , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the x - ray cooling function of the gas ; while for sze , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the icm temperature .",
    "eliminating @xmath28 , gives the angular diameter distance @xmath35 ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "we adopt our fiducial cosmology from the wmap 7-year results ( table 6 of @xcite ) along with the following priors @xmath36 . for simplicity , we choose a flat universe since for an open wcdm model , wmap7+bao+h0 tightly constraints @xmath37 . with a small number of clusters , as suggested by recent sz observations @xcite , just data would not be sufficient to break the cosmology - cluster physics degeneracies .",
    "we therefore put priors on the scaling parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 motivated by recent observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , we put a weak prior of @xmath40 in all the cases .",
    "we consider the following surveys with overlapping sky coverage - + ( 1 ) act / spt : we model the ongoing act / spt survey as a @xmath41 deg@xmath42 with a @xmath12 of 75 mjy ( at 150 ghz ) , so as to give @xmath43 1000 clusters .",
    "+ ( 2 ) planck : ongoing all sky sze survey .",
    "we take @xmath12 to be 300 mjy ( at 353 ghz ) which returns @xmath43 2000 clusters in @xmath44 deg@xmath42 .",
    "the higher flux limit means that planck would detect only massive low @xmath5 clusters .",
    "+ ( 3 ) erosita : upcoming full sky x - ray survey .",
    "we assume a [ 0.5 - 2.0 kev ] band @xmath45 erg @xmath46 s@xmath47 which gives us @xmath48 clusters for @xmath44 deg@xmath42 .",

    "the redshift distribution of clusters is obtained by using the cluster scaling relations to convert flux to the corresponding lowest observable cluster mass @xmath11 .",
    "figure [ fig : m_lim ] shows the @xmath49 for some of the surveys that we have considered .",
    "we further place a lower cut - off of @xmath50 on @xmath49 and a redshift cut - off of 0.1 .",
    "the @xmath3 ( @xmath51 = 0.1 ) likelihoods are computed using cash c statistics .",
    "we generate the mock @xmath4 catalog as follows . for a cluster to be visible in both x - ray and sze surveys ,",
    "its mass must lie above the highest of the @xmath11 from either of the surveys . to estimate @xmath4 ,",
    "one also needs _ at least _ a single isothermal temperature measurement of the icm , which is possible for 10 times the detectable flux ; for this we calculate the corresponding higher @xmath52 .",
    "next , to fit a @xmath26-model , we also require that the clusters be well resolved ; i.e. be larger than a certain minimum angular size , so as to estimate its core radius @xmath53 .",
    "this is fulfilled by the condition that @xmath53 be _ at least @xmath54 times _ the minimum resolution of the survey ( 16  for erosita ) .",
    "we convert this to isophotal size @xmath55 and use the scaling relation between cluster mass and its size @xcite to enforce this constraint .",

    "fig : mock ] ) .",
    "such catalogs are created for overlaps of sze and x - ray surveys like act / spt + erosita and planck + erosita for @xmath54 s of 2 , 3 and 4 .",

    "as expected , with the sne data of a similar size but with much smaller errors ( 7 - 10% ) , we get tighter constraints on dark energy with @xmath71 = 0.15 and @xmath72 = 1.0 .",
    "column 7 of the same table lists the effect of using cmb constraints from the wmap7 results on @xmath1(=0.019 ) and @xmath2(=0.059 ) with the data from act / spt to further improve the constraints on dark energy with @xmath71 = 0.4 and @xmath72 = 2.0 .",
    "these constraints are very similar to the ones through for @xmath54 = 2 ; compare column 3 and 7 in table [ tab : results_spt ] .",
    "next , we compare our constraints with those that would be obtained from dedicated follow - up observations of cluster masses requiring detailed x - ray , sze or galaxy spectroscopic observations @xcite . adding a mass follow - up to @xmath3 constraints the cluster scaling relation and is similar to putting priors on the scaling parameters .",
    "we build two mock catalogs of 97 clusters each , one with errors between 15 - 50% and the other with 30 - 100% errors .",
    "we find that the constrains from both the mass follow - up s ( now without priors on the scaling parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) are very similar to those obtained using priors of the scaling relations , compare column 2 with 8 and 9 in table [ tab : results_spt ] .",
