    "the requirements of laser fusion targets for high power lasers with good laser beam uniformity has driven a quest for new techniques for smoothing the intensity variations on the target surface .",
    "early attempts at beam smoothing[1 ] were not well characterized but more systematic techniques[2 - 6 ] have demonstrated significant improvements in beam uniformity .",
    "all techniques involve introduction of phase nonuniformities which replace the normal beam pattern , typically containing substantial hotspots , with a smaller - length - scale speckle pattern .",
    "further addition of bandwidth to the laser provides temporal smoothing of the speckle .",
    "the primary motivation for investing in these smoothing schemes is to reduce the initial nonuniformities that can seed fluid instabilities such as rayleigh - taylor , yet there is also palpable interest in reducing the strength of laser plasma instabilities such as stimulated raman or brillouin scattering or two plasmon decay . supplying a theoretical framework for understanding these laser plasma interactions with smoothed laser beams is the task we undertake in this article . in a subsequent article[7 ] , the results obtained here will be applied to particular instabilities in geometries of interest .    with the usual assumptions about slow variation of parameters with respect to the frequencies @xmath0 and wave vectors k@xmath1 of the wave",

    "are denoted by v@xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively ; the strength of the coupling between the waves , @xmath3 , proportional to the pump or laser wave amplitude , has the dimensions of frequency and is the rate at which the waves grow without damping in an infinite homogeneous plasma . as the reader will remember , for a coherent driver , both convective and absolute instability may occur provided the laser intensity , i.e. @xmath4 , exceeds certain threshold values set by losses [ 8 ] .",
    "in an unbounded plasma , the convective coherent threshold is    @xmath5    absolute instability requires that the decay waves be oppositely directed @xmath6 , and , the absolute coherent threshold is    @xmath7    temporal and spatial incoherence introduce two additional parameters , the temporal bandwidth @xmath8 and the spatial bandwidth ( or spread in wavevectors ) @xmath9 which is inversely related to the correlation length @xmath10 .    the effects of both temporal and stationary spatial pump incoherence on parametric instabilities in homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally over the past thirty years [ 9 - 68 ] .",
    "the first approach was quite naturally to consider the purely temporal problem with coupled mode equations in homogeneous plasma .",
    "zaslavskii and zakharov [ 9 ] considered the generic undamped decay instability with methods developed earlier for studying the relaxation of two level molecular systems driven by an external field [ 10 ] .",
    "they found that the convective growth rate was reduced , in the limit @xmath11 , from @xmath3 to @xmath12 .",
    "both valeo and oberman [ 11 ] and tamor [ 12 ] addressed this problem with different methods and obtained the same result .",
    "tamor included a damping rate on the langmuir wave coupled to an acoustic wave and found a dispersion relation where the damping rate for the langmuir wave @xmath13 is replaced by @xmath14 .",
    "he noted reasonably that the bandwidth was unimportant unless it exceeded the damping rate @xmath15 but made no comment on the fact that the bandwidth appeared asymmetrically in his dispersion relation ; that is , the apparent damping of the acoustic wave was unaffected . in a series of articles [ 13 - 15 ] , thomson made a number of important contributions .",
    "first , he noted that for equal damping on both modes , the threshold was @xmath16 if @xmath17 and incorrectly speculated that , for unequal damping , the threshold was @xmath18 .",
    "this guess was based on the assumption that , for growth to occur in either mode , the average amplitude of both must grow .",
    "the correct solution was presented by thomson[15 ] later using an exactly solvable model [ 69 ] . for the purely temporal problem",
    ", the ensemble - averaged mode amplitude equations showed these equations decouple and have @xmath19 thresholds , i.e.    @xmath20    and    @xmath21 thomson noticed and explained the asymmetry as due to averaging over the rapidly varying phase of the mode amplitude .",
    "he obtained a more appropriate threshold by solving the equations for the ensemble averaged intensities .",
    "the solution showed that the lower of the thresholds ( i-3,4 ) was appropriate .",
    "we show , as did thomson , that the incoherent growth rate for the average intensity is    @xmath22 provided @xmath23 .",
    "this answer is expected , given that the average amplitudes grow with rate @xmath24 .",
    "however , thomson did not point out the interesting fact ( found also by laval et al.[16 ] in the space - time problem when @xmath25 ) that , if @xmath26 , the incoherent growth rate is @xmath27 that is twice the expected rate .",
    "we will comment more on this in secs .",
    "thomson then considered the space time problem with the ensemble averaged mode amplitude equations and again found an asymmetry in the thresholds for the absolute instability when @xmath28 .",
    "thomson naturally assumed that the appropriate intensity threshold , in analogy with the temporal problem , was the lower one .",
    "later work showed this to be incorrect .",
    "laval et al . reconsidered [ 70 ] the space -time problem for the evolution of the intensities both by using the bourret approximation and , in the case @xmath29 , the exactly solvable kubo - anderson process ( kap ) .",
    "they showed that the intensity thresholds are in fact much lower than the amplitude thresholds when @xmath30 and , in usual cases of interest ( @xmath31 ) , the incoherent absolute threshold equals the product of the bandwidth and the damping on the slow wave    @xmath32 in a later publication [ 17 ] , thomson applied the results to stimulated raman forward scatter and incorrectly concluded , as we discuss subsequently , that small amounts of bandwidth , comparable to its growth rate , can suppress this slowly - growing instability . during this time period ,",
    "the nonlinear evolution of instabilities driven by broadband pumps was investigated by using particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations [ 18 - 20 ] .",
    "these studies demonstrated a reduction in the stimulated brillouin reflectivity from 60% to less than 10% with 5% bandwidth .",
    "because these plasmas were strongly inhomogeneous , no reduction is expected for modest bandwidth , @xmath33 , as shown by thomson [ 15 ] . however , with @xmath34 , the line separations in these simulations are larger than an acoustic frequency and each line acts independently .",

    "estabrook et al . also considered , with pic simulations , the effect of laser bandwidth on stimulated raman scattering again in inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "bandwidth was represented by a series of equally spaced laser lines .",
    "a reduction in the reflectivity was found when the line separation was greater the growth rate .",
    "each line acted as an independent pump , and the intensity was low enough that the instability was not strongly saturated .",
    "direct comparisons between homogeneous plasma theory and pic simulations of srs in a plasma slab were made by forslund et al . [ 21 ] with good agreement for the dependence of the srs growth rate on the bandwidth of the frequency modulated laser .",
    "these authors pointed out that , @xmath42 , despite a fourfold reduction in the growth rate , only a modest reduction in the power reflected was observed in the final state .",
    "a further increase of bandwidth to @xmath43 brought the instability below threshold .",
    "later pic work [ 24 ] with multiple lines also showed good agreement with theory for the raman backscatter growth rate when @xmath44 at several combinations of density and laser intensity .",
    "these simulations also showed a monotonic decrease with bandwidth in the absorption into hot electrons due to srs and in the srs reflected power .",
    "less effect on the forward srs was observed , consistent with the theory we discuss subsequently . other theoretical work on pump bandwidth effects concerned applications to specific targets [ 30 ] , and the application to induced spatial incoherence ( isi ) [ 44 ] .",
    "the effects of both temporal and spatial bandwidth in a 1d inhomogeneous plasma [ 45 ] for a phase mismatch , @xmath45 , varying linearly , @xmath46 , or quadratically , @xmath47 , was treated by analytical and numerical methods . in reference",

    "early experiments [ 25,26 ] that attempted to observe laser bandwidth effects utilized plasmas that were too nonuniform to expect observable effects . later experiments used gas jet targets [ 27,29 ] or used microwave plasmas [ 28 ] .",
    "clayton et al . and giles et al .",
    "divided the laser power into two lines and found a striking reductions in reflected sbs power compared to a single line with the same total laser power .",
    "the lines were separated by much more than a growth rate .",
    "it was recognized early [ 31 - 33 ] that random spatial modulation of the phase mismatch , @xmath48 , could also reduce parametric instability growth rates . using methods similar to the temporal problem , kaw et al .",

    "beam smoothing techniques use not only temporally incoherent but also spatially incoherent pump waves . in the focal plane , the laser wave can be considered a sum of randomly phased plane waves with a spread in wavevectors , @xmath9 . in the limit of no temporal bandwidth ,",
    "the spatial interference pattern of the pump wave envelope is stationary and is related to the effect of stationary plasma turbulence on parametric instability treated by williams et al.[39 ] using a novel approach ( unrelated to the methods used in the present analysis ) , they considered the threshold and growth rate for absolute modes in a finite system of length l. this analysis finds that for sufficiently large spatial bandwidth , @xmath9 , the fastest growth rate is reduced from the coherent absolute rate , @xmath53 when @xmath54 to the spatially incoherent absolute rate @xmath55    ( to obtain i-9 from eq .",

    "the rpa dispersion relation ( vi.1 ) for an infinite system obtained from the rpa equations ( v.32 ) form the basis for the analysis of growth rates and thresholds in section vi .",
    "there are two parameters that play a role in the ensemble average equations that measure the effective bandwidth , @xmath57 where @xmath58    in the general case of spatial and temporal incoherence , there can be a gap between the domain of validity for the rpa dispersion relation and the coherent one .",
    "the coherent domain is the whole region where either spectral width @xmath59 is less than the corresponding damping rate or growth rate.in this intermediate region , the average amplitude dispersion relations ( vi.2 ) are valid , and the more unstable one agrees with the rpa dispersion relation within a factor of two .",
    "it is on this basis that we argue that the rpa dispersion relation can be used in the whole domain ( denoted the incoherent domain ) complementary to the coherent domain .    in the remainder of sec .",
    "vi , a description of parametric instabilities is given including the conditions for absolute and convective instability .",
    "both early time behavior , which is dominated by convective instability , and long time behavior , which is dominated by absolute instability ( if it exists ) or by spatial amplification are considered .",
    "it is worth noting that , in the incoherent domain , the average amplitude dispersion relations ( vi.2 ) allow only convective solutions whereas the rpa dispersion relation ( vi.1 ) allows the possibility of absolute instability if a threshold can be exceeded .",
    "however , the simpler average amplitude equations do provide the convective mode threshold ( vi.5 ) , growth rate ( vi.7 ) , and spatial amplification factor ( vi.13 ) and ( vi.16 ) ( within better than a factor of two ) in agreement with those obtained in sec .",
    "vi using the rpa dispersion relation .",
    "absolute instabilities are of particular practical interest because , above threshold , the only limit to their growth is the finite laser energy or other nonlinear effects . on the other hand , an absolute instability generally has a larger threshold to overcome losses to collisional or landau damping than a convective instability . for a coherent laser wave ,",
    "the threshold laser intensity is determined by setting the spatial growth rate @xmath60 equal to one - half of the sum of the spatial loss rates @xmath61 for the decay modes ( eq .",

    "( i-8 ) , the absolute instability growth rate is smaller than the growth rate @xmath3 by approximately the ratio @xmath62 in the usual case @xmath63 . the exact formula is also given by eq .",
    "( vi.11 ) . with incoherent laser beams ,",
    "the threshold is still determined by setting the effective spatial growth rate equal to the sum of loss rates but now the spatial growth rate is @xmath64 , that is , the maximum spatial growth rate for the average amplitude equations .",
    "the general formula is given by ( vi.9 ) .",
    "note in the special but interesting case that @xmath65 , temporal incoherence    increases the absolute threshold if @xmath66 which exceeds the naive criterion by the square root of the group velocity ratio .",
    "we observe that the statement @xmath67 is equivalent to requiring that the coherent spatial growth length @xmath68 exceed the larger coherence length @xmath69 . a rigorous application[46 ] of the bers and briggs criteria[75 ] arrives at this same condition as a necessary condition ( vi.10 ) for the incoherent limit to apply . above the incoherent threshold ,",
    "the incoherent absolute growth rate is roughly @xmath70 , ( the exact formula is given by eq .",
    "( vi.8 ) ) i.e. approximately the same expression as the incoherent convective growth rate but with a different domain of validity .",
    "there is a limit where the effective bandwidths @xmath59 are determined only by spatial incoherence .",
    "then @xmath71 is independent of the group velocity and the growth rate , @xmath72 agrees with the scaling found previously and given in eq . ( i-9 ) .",
    "thus our general threshold and growth rate formulae indeed recover the correct limits of purely spatial and purely temporal incoherence derived previously .",
    "the coherent convective threshold , always lower than that for absolute instability , is given by the requirement that the growth rate @xmath3 be greater than the mean loss rate @xmath73 .",
    "the same criterion for an incoherent pump applies if the laser intensity is reduced by the ratio of line widths factor @xmath74 .",
    "the effective bandwidth @xmath59 must be larger than the corresponding damping rate @xmath2 for each mode to increase the threshold",
    ". otherwise the coherent threshold applies ( i-1 ) . far above the incoherent threshold ,",
    "the incoherent convective growth rate is reduced by the factor @xmath75 . note that when @xmath76 the convective and absolute incoherent growth rates are equal in the overlapping domain of validity .",
    "more exact expressions are given by ( vi.5 ) - ( vi.7 ) .",
    "for many cases of practical interest @xmath77 because the spread in laser wavenumbers is sufficiently small and/or the group velocity is small enough that @xmath78 and either @xmath79 or @xmath80 . then temporal incoherence is the dominant stabilizing influence .",
    "however two special cases deserve mention .",
    "examination of the expression ( vi.8b ) for the absolute instability growth rate above threshold shows that if the maximum value of the coherence length @xmath81 occurs for the minimum group velocity , the growth rate is strongly reduced @xmath82 in the usual case @xmath83 .",
    "this case can occur if there is a large spread in wavenumber accompanied by a weak temporal incoherence so that @xmath84 .",
    "the transient or convective growth rate for the same case ( in the incoherent limit ) is larger , @xmath85 .",
    "the other unusual case occurs in the case of temporal incoherence for forward scatter when @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath87 so that the coherent convective growth still occurs even if @xmath88 .",
    "the case of practical interest is stimulated raman forward scatter.[22 - 24 ]    the fate of absolutely unstable modes necessarily requires consideration of nonlinear effects but , in a bounded plasma , the maximum amplitude of convectively unstable waves may be found by computing the spatial amplification rate . in general",
    "there are two roots that are most easily obtained by using the average amplitude equations ( vi.2 ) but are also accessible from the average intensity equations ( vi.1 ) .",
    "a bandwidth @xmath89 is usually sufficient to reduce the spatial growth rate . for moderate intensities , i.e. , below any absolute threshold , the spatial gain coefficient @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 ) is reduced by @xmath92 in the weak damping case . at higher intensities , a second root with gain coefficient @xmath93 occurs provided @xmath94 and @xmath95 , that is , above the absolute mode threshold when @xmath96 .",
    "therefore both a convective and absolute mode exist ; and , interestingly , the convective mode has a spatial gain rate that exceeds that of the absolute mode . a more detailed discussion and",
    "exact formulae are given in eqs .",
    "( vi.12 ) - ( vi.18 ) .    in the general case ,",
    "it is difficult to summarize the effects of incoherence on convective and absolute stabilities .",
    "however , it is useful to consider a common case of practical interest where @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ". then diagrams showing stability regions can be constructed with axes @xmath99 and @xmath100 , i.e. moving towards more incoherence in one direction and towards more damping in the other .",
    "figure vi.1 is such a diagram for convectively unstable modes .",
    "there are four regions : coherently unstable , incoherently unstable with reduced growth rate , coherently stable , and incoherently stabilized . in fig .",
    "vi.2 , the diagram for absolutely unstable modes is drawn with four analogous regions .",
    "this figure graphically shows that , in only a small region of parameter space does incoherence reduce the growth rate but not completely stabilize .",
    "figure vi.3 shows the different regions for spatial amplification . finally , in fig .",
    "vi.4 , an overall diagram is shown for all regions for convective , absolute , and spatial amplification .    to this point , we have presented results for infinite homogeneous plasma . for a large enough system ,",
    "these results are a good guide to the behavior in finite systems . nonetheless , real plasmas are finite and it is well known that a threshold length is necessary for absolute instability . moreover in sec .",
    "vii , numerical solutions of the coupled mode equations ( ii.10 ) are presented in a necessarily finite system .",
    "thus partly as a guide to the numerical solutions , we find the threshold length for absolute instability in the coherent and incoherent limit as obtained by solving eq .",
    "( ii-10 ) or eq .",
    "( v.32 ) as appropriate .",
    "it is an interesting feature that the normal modes in the slab , sinusoidal in the coherent limit , are exponential in the incoherent limit .",
    "the threshold length given by eq .",
    "( vi.30 ) increases as expected with bandwidth above the coherent threshold length ( vi.29 ) .",
    "several features of the statistical description that provoked further analysis were the `` unexpected '' factor of two that appeared in the growth rate for the ensemble - average intensity , the question of the validity of the rpa description in the intermediate domain , and the applicability of these results to analysis of experiments using beam smoothing techniques .",
    "these aspects were examined in sec .",
    "vii by integrating directly the coupled mode equations ( ii.10 ) or ( vii.1 ) with particular choices of random processes to represent the pump wave incoherence . for the purely temporal case , an analytic solution for the distribution function of mode amplitude ( eq .",
    "( vii.10 ) is obtained which is remarkably broad if the damping rates are negligible .",
    "in fact , the width of the gaussian distribution is equal to the mean .",
    "thus , higher powers of the amplitude , e.g. , the intensity grow at faster rates than the mean which gives rise to factor of two mentioned earlier .",
    "we compare this distribution to a numerically generated one in fig . 6 for the same parameters . on the other hand , with sufficient damping , this factor of two does not appear ; that is , the average intensity and amplitude grow at corresponding rates . in this case , the distribution is strikingly narrowed as also shown in fig .",
    "6 .    in the space - time problem",
    "this factor of two also occurs for absolute instability driven by an incoherent pump when the decay wave group velocities are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign .",
    "we have verified our supposition by numerical integration that once again the distribution is broad for @xmath101 but is much narrower if @xmath102 as shown in fig . 7 .",
    "the validity of the rpa description in the intermediate domain was examined numerically in sec .",
    "vii.b , by considering the model of a spatially incoherent pump driving a pair of decay waves satisfying the intermediate domain inequalities ( vii.13 ) .",
    "although we did show that the rpa equations appear valid , we also discovered that the distribution of mode intensities ( fig .",
    "8) is unusual in that it consists of a slowly decreasing tail on a distribution with a peak at nearly zero growth .",
    "we also show in sec . vii.c that the standard model of an isi beam , eq .",
    "( vii.15 ) , which has both phase and intensity variation , can be treated as an incoherent pump wave provided the temporal and spatial bandwidth are large enough .",
    "thus with the appropriate identification of experimental parameters with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the formulae in sec .",
    "vi can be applied to experiments.[51 - 65 ]    a few remarks are in order regarding the derivation of the statistical equations that form the basics for the results outlined above .",
    "the analysis begins in section ii with the completely nonlinear coupled - mode equations ( ii.2 ) appropriate for the case when the pump and decay waves are weakly coupled and weakly damped . in the linear analysis of this article , the pump wave is unaffected by the decay waves and the characteristic growth rate of the parametric instability is simply related to the pump amplitude at its mean wavevector ( ii.5 ) .",
    "normalization of the decay wave amplitudes to the average pump wave energy yields the linearized coupled - mode equation ( ii.7 ) in fourier space . from these equations ,",
    "the envelope equations ( ii.9 ) in fourier space or ( ii.10 ) in real space are obtained by expanding the mode amplitudes about the value at the mean wavevector .",
    "these envelope equations are used in sections iii - v to obtain equations for the ensemble - averaged mode amplitudes and intensities .",
    "if the pump wave has a distribution of wavevectors , then a given pair of decay waves will be frequency matched to only a portion of the pump wave spectrum .",
    "thus one is naturally led to consider the frequency mismatches ( iii.1 ) for a general triplet of wavevectors or the mismatches ( iii.2 ) at the mean value of the decay wavevector .",
    "it is assumed that there exist triplets for which there is exact matching so that the mismatch near the mean wavevectors is small .",
    "the maximum value of the mismatches at the mean decay wavevector determines that the interaction is coherent if the mismatches are both small in the sense defined by iii.6 .    two approaches to generating",
    "equations governing the ensemble averaged behavior of the instability are used in this article .",
    "the first employs the bourret approximation[70 ] to obtain the dispersion relation ( iv.5 ) and ( iv.7 ) for the stability of the ensemble - averaged mode amplitude @xmath103 .",
    "each equation for @xmath103 is simple in that it does not involve the other but it does involve integrals over the spectral density of the pump wave and the frequency mismatch . in the incoherent limit or markov limit defined by ( iv.17 ) , the dispersion relation takes the particularly simple and well- known form given by eq .",
    "( iv.13 ) which states that the coupling between the waves is reduced by the ratio of the characteristic growth rate to the maximum mismatch @xmath104 for @xmath105 . for the one dimensional case with a pump spectrum that is lorentzian , e.g. a kubo - anderson process",
    ", the dispersion relations ( iv.22 ) are the familiar ones derived previously[15 - 16 ] and the mismatch @xmath104 is equivalent to the spectral widths @xmath106 defined by ( iv.20 ) that are , within at most a factor of two , equal to the pump wave bandwidth @xmath8 ( except for the special case of forward scatter where the @xmath107 ) . note in one dimension , the problem of spatial and temporal incoherence are not independent in fact so our restriction to one dimension must yield the results[16 ] of laval et al .",
    "however in our numerical models , this connection is broken for convenience and tractability .",
    "the average amplitude equations ( iv.5 and iv.7 ) are somewhat unsatisfying because @xmath108 and @xmath109 evolve independently . for the case of temporal incoherence alone , this untidiness was remedied by obtaining equations for the ensemble averaged intensities which are coupled and symmetric . nevertheless , the result obtained for convective instabilities with only temporal incoherence is just that obtained by consideration of the most unstable average amplitude .    in section v.b",
    ", the same procedure can be followed to obtain bourret equations for the ensemble - averaged spectral densities ( v.25 ) that are related to the mode intensities by ( v.2 ) . as with the amplitude equations ( iv.5 and ( iv.7 ) , these equations involve integrals over the pump spectral density and the frequency mismatch ; but , in addition , the integral contains the spectral density of the other decay wave at the pump shifted wavenumber .",
    "two further approximations can be made : first , the markov assumption valid provided that the mismatch is larger than the maximum of the growth rate and damping rates , i.e. @xmath110 removes the spatial and temporal growth rate from the integrand ; second , the assumption that the decay wave spectral densities are slowly varying functions allows these densities to be evaluated at the mean wavenumber at exact matching .",
    "the first approximation yields the random phase approximation ( rpa ) equations ( v.28 ) ; and the subsidiary second approximation yields the set ( v.32 ) with which the instability analysis is done in section vi .",
    "as they must do , the rpa equations ( v.28 ) are shown to reduce to the correct intensity equations derived using the bourret approximation when the pump wave group velocity is infinite .",
    "for the purely temporal incoherence modeled by the kubo - anderson process[69 ] , this latter result is exact .",

    "regarding now under which conditions the pump wave incoherence modifies the parametric coupling , one may first easily admit that a sufficient condition for neglecting the pump wave incoherence is that the two following inequalities be both satisfied : @xmath243 @xmath244    in the latter inequalities , @xmath245 denotes the dispersion relation @xmath246    in the envelope approximation , @xmath245 reduces to @xmath247 where , @xmath118 and @xmath248 denote the time and space growth rates .",

    "since @xmath118 and @xmath248 are related through the dispersion relation , the size of @xmath254 depends upon the nature of the instability which is considered , namely convective , absolute , or spatially amplifying .",
    "it therefore follows that the coherent or incoherent character of the parametric coupling depends itself on the nature of the instability .",
    "defining now as `` incoherent '' the domain where the pump wave incoherence induces a reduction of the parametric growth , one realizes that such a domain should be specified as `` convectively incoherent '' , or `` absolutely incoherent '' , or `` incoherent for spatial amplification '' .",
    "for instance , in the case of a purely temporal incoherence , with @xmath255 , it has been shown in ( laval , et.al . )",
    "that the pump wave incoherence reduces the convective growth for @xmath256 and @xmath257 , whereas in the case of an absolute instability , the absolute growth can be reduced only if @xmath8 satisfies : @xmath258 [ for simplicity we consider the case where @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "] one thus sees with this simple case that the reduction of the absolute growth is much more difficult to achieve than that of the convective growth .",
    "we may recall here that the convective growth rate characterizes the instability in the early stage of its development , by contrast with its long time evolution which is characterized either by the absolute growth rate ( whenever the conditions for their existence are satisfied ) or by the spatial amplification growth length ( in the opposite case ) .",
    "in this article we will derive the conditions under which the pump incoherence gives rise to a reduction of the convective and of the absolute growth rates and an increase in the spatial amplification length .",
    "it will be found that generally the conditions for reducing the absolute instabilities are more severe than those for the convective ones .",
    "for this reason we will concentrate mainly our discussions on the `` convectively incoherent '' domain , which may thus be regarded as the largest domain in which a reduction of the parametric growth may be expected in the early stage of the instability development . in order to simplify our terminology , the `` incoherent '' domain , without any other specification , will henceforth refer to the previously defined `` convectively incoherent '' domain .",
    "restricting ourselves to the convective instabilities , one may rewrite inequalities ( iii.6 ) as : @xmath261 @xmath262 in which we used @xmath263 in the coherent regime . as said before",
    ", these inequalities represent only a _ sufficient _",
    "condition for the pump wave incoherence being ignorable ; the question is thus whether both of these two inequalities have to be satisfied , or only one .",
    "in order to answer this question , we first introduce in a brief discussion the validity conditions of the statistical equations which describe the time evolution of the quantities @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "a statistical description for the evolution of the decay waves 1 and 2 is provided by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) equations for the evolution of the average intensities @xmath264 .",
    "the latter provide equations for the evolution on a slow time - or slow space - scale of the spectral densities @xmath265(x , t ) of the decay waves [ the latter functions @xmath266(x , t ) ] will be defined in the general case by eq .",
    "( v.2 ) ; at this point it is sufficient to say that for a purely temporal problem one has the usual relation @xmath267 .",
    "the rpa equations are nonlinear and they may account for the pump depletion ; the interested reader is referred to standard textbooks[72 ] for their derivation in the general case . in our problem of stability analysis , we face a linear problem ; we could naturally use directly the rpa equations on which we would make _ a posteriori _ the linear approximation which consists in neglecting the pump depletion . in this article",
    "we will follow a different route .",
    "we will first take advantage of the linear character of the coupled mode equations ii.6 which will enable us to use the so - called bourret approximation[70 ] for the evolution of @xmath206 ; on the other hand , the bourret approximation for the evolution of the intensities @xmath268 is easily tractable within the envelope approximation only , and then only for the special case where the pump wave group velocity @xmath131 is infinite . in the general case",
    "it is necessary to make supplementary approximations to the bourret equations , and these approximations are justified in a domain that will be defined subsequently as the `` rpa domain . ''",
    "returning now to the condition defining the domain in which the parametric coupling takes place coherently , we first define the temporal and spatial growth rates @xmath269 for @xmath270 , and @xmath271 for @xmath272 , according to : @xmath273 \\eqno ( iii.9)\\ ] ] @xmath274\\ ] ] a factor 2 has been included in the argument of the exponential defining @xmath275 and @xmath276 so that the equality @xmath277 holds in the coherent case .",
    "more generally the schwartz inequality yields the following result @xmath278 for i = 1 and 2 , in the case of a purely temporal growth ( and @xmath279 in the case of a spatial growth ) .",
    "admitting that the pump incoherence may only reduce the parametric growth ( in the case of a convective instability in a homogeneous plasma ) , one realizes that , whenever either @xmath280 or @xmath281 behaves coherently , the two quantities @xmath282 and @xmath283 must also behave both coherently .    in the next section",

    "accordingly , the `` convectively incoherent '' domain - or simply incoherent domain - is defined by the two conditions @xmath289 and @xmath290    on the other hand , the validity conditions for the rpa are very stringent .",
    "in section v they will be found to consist of two sets of inequalities ; the first one corresponds to the inequalities opposite to ( iii.6 ) , namely @xmath291 @xmath292 and a second set involving the cross inequalities @xmath293 @xmath294    since the rpa dispersion relation yields @xmath295 for the convective growth rate , the latter inequalities reduce essentially to @xmath296 @xmath297 @xmath298 @xmath299 which can also be recast into the more compact form @xmath300    the latter inequalities ( iii.14 ) or ( iii.15 ) , define what is called the ( convective ) rpa domain .",
    "one can now see that the incoherent domain ( iii.12 ) is subdivided into 1 ) the rpa domain in which the cross inequalities ( iii.14b ) and ( iii.14d ) are both satisfied , 2 ) the intermediate domain corresponding to the regime where the two inequalities @xmath301 and @xmath302 are both fulfilled whereas at least one of the cross inequalities ( iii.14c ) and ( iii .",

    "if the distribution is narrow , then the intensity growth rate will be close to twice the amplitude growth rate .",

    "the convective growth rate characterizes therefore the transient behavior only ; although the green function @xmath601 for a plasma slab of length l does not reduce to the green function @xmath602 of the infinite case , it is usually admitted that the infinite system convective growth rate @xmath596 does properly describe the early time behavior for t@xmath603 .",

    "similarly it is usually admitted that whenever the plasma length l satisfies the condition @xmath608 , the growth rate of the most unstable normal mode is well approximated by the absolute growth rate @xmath609 of the infinite case .",
    "when absolute instabilities do not exist but the system is convectively unstable , the long term behavior is determined by spatial amplification .",

    "such behavior also indicates that a significant spatial amplification may be expected in a finite plasma slab whenever the condition @xmath615 is fulfilled , where @xmath616 denotes the maximum @xmath617 .",

    "to do so we compare the rpa predictions with those for the average amplitudes .    the dispersion relation corresponding to the rpa equations v.32 . is @xmath620 and the dispersion relation for the average amplitude @xmath621 eq .",

    "one can only use the inequality ( iii.10 ) , namely max@xmath630 which states that the actual growth rate @xmath436 is no less than the most unstable average amplitude ( the latter being reduced as compared with the coherent growth rate since eq .",

    "it will be seen in the next subsection that they are identical with regard to the convective threshold and convective growth rate to within a numerical factor no larger than two .",

    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath639 the growth rate obtained from the dispersion relation vi.1 , and by @xmath640 the largest convective growth rate given by the bourret dispersion relation vi.2 , it is the matter of a simple calculation to show that the following inequalities @xmath641 hold formally , i.e. independently of the applicability of the rpa and bourret equations ( the upper inequality occurs in the case @xmath642 ) .",
    "since in the rpa domain one has @xmath643 and max @xmath644 , one deduces that the latter inequality can be written @xmath645 in the rpa domain .",
    "this result means that the phase mixing effects on @xmath646 are negligible , at least for the most unstable average amplitude .",
    "since this property is satisfied in the rpa domain , which can be regarded as the most incoherent domain , i.e. the domain in which the phase mixing effects are expected to be the more important , we make the conjecture that the inequality ( vi.4 ) is satisfied in the intermediate domain as well . on the other hand , in this domain",

    "the question here is whether the rpa equations are applicable in the whole domain defined by the inequalities @xmath909 and @xmath910 or whether there is an intermediate domain when one of the cross inequalities @xmath911 or @xmath912 is not satisfied .",
    "to examined this case we look at the spatial kubo - anderson ( k - a ) process analyzed previously@xmath913 with zero temporal incoherence and spatial correlation function with the property @xmath914 if we assume @xmath102 and @xmath799 , then the intermediate domain is described by the chain of inequalities , @xmath915 a physical example that might produce this set of inequalities is two plasmon decay in the presence of stationary ion acoustic turbulence where the shorter wavelength langmuir wave is more strongly damped and has a faster group velocity .",
    "the choices in our numerical solution were :    @xmath916 for which the rpa equation absolute instability growth rate @xmath917 and the absolute instability coherent growth rate ( vi.11 ) , @xmath918 .",
    "the simulation region @xmath919 was larger than the threshold length given by the maximum of eq . vi.32 and",
    "vi.29.the simulation was run until @xmath920 for 1000 independent realizations of this spatial k - a process .",
    "an initial value was given to the undamped wave at t = 0 but the intensity at @xmath921 was measured relative to the intensity at @xmath922 because by that time the modes were observed to grow at this time asymptotic rate .",
    "the ensemble averaged rate @xmath891 was found to be independent of whether its calculation was based on the intensity at the source point @xmath923 or the total mode `` energy '' @xmath924 .",
    "the results support our conjecture that the rpa equations apply in the whole incoherent domain , because the measured intensity growth rate , @xmath925 agreed with the rpa rate @xmath926 . however , the distribution of intensity at @xmath927 ( relative to @xmath928 ) displayed in fig 8 showed that , in fully a third of the cases , no growth occurred and that the remaining distribution consisted of a slowly decreasing tail .",
    "the maximum intensity in the distribution was achieved by a mode that grew at close to the coherent rate .",
    "in addition , the faster growth rates were achieved in cases in which there was an abnormally long distance between phase changes ; in the maximum growth case , this distance was 2.18 @xmath929 . as we remarked at the outset of this section and in the introduction ( sec .",
    "i ) , the growth of parametric instabilities with this model of spatial incoherence was studied by williams et al . using more sophisticated statistical methods ( quite different in nature to those used in this article ) with the result that the fastest growing mode grows at the rate @xmath930 , given by eq .",
    "this rate @xmath930 depends on the size of the system , which is understood on the basis that as the system gets larger there is an increasing possibility that there will be a large region with no phase change . in our simulation",
    "this size dependent factor @xmath931 turns out to be approximately equal to the numerical factor of 4 in the rpa growth rate ( eq .",
    "vi.8a ) ; all other factors are identical and @xmath932 .",
    "unfortunately it is not feasible to simulate a system that doubles the size of this logarithmic factor with a constant value of @xmath933 .",
    "thus these simulations do not distinguish between the rpa theory and the results of williams et al .",
    "however , the simulations do support the conjecture that the incoherent results apply in whole incoherent domain .      one motivation for this work is the induced spatial incoherence technique ( isi ) for creating smoothed laser beam intensity distributions in the focal plane . in this technique , statistically independent beamlets overlap and",
    "thereby produce both intensity and phase variations . only pumps with phase variation alone",
    "have been considered up to this point in our numerical examples . here",
    "we wish to show that the same statistical methods are valid for intensity and phase varying pumps if the conditions for the incoherent results to apply are met .",
    "a model that exhibits both intensity and phase variation in one dimension is given by , @xmath934 when @xmath935 is uniformly distributed on @xmath936 and @xmath937 is a random variable of time .",
    "each @xmath938 varies independently with the same mean coherence time , @xmath939 .",
    "the spatial coherence length in this model , @xmath940 , is related to the focal length of the focussing optic . a shorter focal length results in a shorter coherence length .",
    "at any given point and instant of time , the intensity @xmath941 , being the absolute square of the sum of n complex numbers of length n@xmath942 , is gaussian distributed with unit mean and variance . because the sum varies with position over a length scale @xmath943 , the instantaneous spatial intensity pattern is quite spikey with peak to average variations of more than two quite common .",
    "however because the sum at a given spatial position also varies in time with coherence time @xmath944 , the time averaged intensity is a much smoother function of space . clearly if @xmath945 is constant in time , then the spikey intensity pattern of eq .",
    "vii.15 is stationary which can lead in the coherent domain to growth enhanced relative to a uniform intensity . even in the incoherent domain without temporal bandwidth",
    ", we saw in the previous section that there is a finite probability , especially in large systems , for the phase to remain constant for a large distance . with phase and intensity variations , large fluctuations in growth rates",
    "are expected in the absence of temporal bandwidth . in the complementary limit",
    "where @xmath946 , the results of our statistical analysis should apply . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose to compute the convective growth for both temporal and spatial incoherence in the incoherent limit and for large group velocity ratios , @xmath947 . with a single term in the sum in eq . vii.15 and @xmath948 ,",
    "the convective growth rate was in agreement with eq .",
    "( vi.7 ) . with no temporal bandwidth , @xmath949",
    ", the pump intensity has striking amplitude variation with peak to average variations of more than three to one .",
    "nonetheless if @xmath950 , the convective growth rate , is reduced according to eq .",
    "( vi.7 ) even if @xmath949 . as the spatial incoherence weakens and the boundary @xmath951 is approached for @xmath949 the measured growth rate in the simulations diverges from eq .",
    "( vi.7 ) until , for @xmath952 , growth rates in excess of @xmath953 can occur with large fluctuations from case to case .",
    "laser bandwidth , even if @xmath954 , reduces both the fluctuations and the growth rate to less than @xmath953 .",
    "thus , some bandwidth is needed in this model to provide a smooth transition from the coherent to incoherent domain .",
    "other models such as the one used in section vii.b have the property that @xmath955 so that the statement that pump incoherence can only reduce the growth rate is indeed true .",
    "simulations in that case do show a smooth transition from the coherent to incoherent growth rate",
    "a comprehensive treatment of the effects of pump wave temporal and spatial incoherence has been presented for a homogeneous plasma . eschewing specific models of incoherence that allow exact solutions , we have derived equations for ensemble averaged mode intensity and amplitudes in the incoherent limit . at each step in the process of deriving these approximate statistical equations ,",
    "the conditions that must be satisfied are clearly stated .",
    "thus , the meaning of incoherence in the context of parametric instability theory is carefully defined .",
    "the set of inequalities that comprise this definition form a major contribution of this work .",
    "of course , the primary contribution of this work is the set of thresholds , growth rates , and amplification rates for both coherent and incoherent , convectively and absolutely unstable parametric interactions .",
    "however , the majority of our readers are interested in the more practical results concerning thresholds , growth rates , and amplification coefficients as they pertain to laser plasma interactions . in a subsequent work,@xmath956",
    "we will apply the results presented here to particular instabilities , and include both backscatter and sidescatter geometries . here",
    ", we briefly consider the examples of stimulated raman and brillouin backscatter for parameters of interest to laser fusion .",
    "we choose the electron temperature , @xmath957 , the charge state z = 40 , the atomic number a = 80 , the laser wavelength , @xmath958 , the laser intensity i = 10@xmath959 w/@xmath960 and the electron density , @xmath961 for srs and 0.25 n@xmath962 for sbs . here",
    "n@xmath962 is the critical electron density defined by @xmath963 . for almost all calculations",
    "it is the ratio z / a and not z or a by themselves that is important .",
    "the nominal sbs growth rate is @xmath964 whereas the srs coherent convective threshold , eq .",
    "( i-1 ) is @xmath965 .",
    "landau damping was neglected because for @xmath957 , an electron density can always be chosen to make it negligible .",
    "thus srs is an order of magnitude above threshold .",
    "the laser bandwidth sufficient to achieve convective stability can be found by using eq .",
    "we find @xmath966 . on the other hand , the coherent threshold for absolute instability given by eq .",
    "( vi.9a ) , @xmath967 , is exceeded by less than a factor of two .",
    "however , as we have emphasized , in sec .",
    "vi , relatively large laser bandwidth is required to reduce the absolute growth rate .",
    "satisfying the validity conditions for using the incoherent formula , eq .",
    "( vi.10 ) , imposes the condition , @xmath968 , which is , coincidentally , the same condition numerically that is required for absolute stability as determined by eq .",
    "( vi.9a ) .",
    "the sbs thresholds are dependent on the ion acoustic damping rate and thus the ion temperature , @xmath969 .",
    "however , even if @xmath970 the ion landau damping is negligible for @xmath971 .",
    "thus , the ion acoustic damping rate is determined by the electrons and is given by @xmath972 .",
    "hence , the convective coherent threshold @xmath973 is easily exceeded by the nominal sbs growth rate @xmath974 .",
    "in addition , the sbs absolute instability coherent threshold @xmath975 is exceeded . here , the bandwidth required to achieve convective stability is @xmath976 .",
    "moreover , the bandwidth required for absolute stability is by accidental choice of parameters , the same as for convective stability because although @xmath977 , nonetheless @xmath978 and the incoherent absolute threshold eq .",
    "( vi.9a ) reduces to the incoherent convective threshold eq .",
    "( vi.6 ) . at this point , we should warn the reader that the results reported here assumed the validity of the coupled mode equations which requires the mode frequencies @xmath979 for j = 0,1,2 .",
    "however , we have in the case of sbs a critical bandwidth for stability that exceeds the ion acoustic frequency @xmath980 . at the very least",
    ", one might expect additional stability when @xmath981 .",
    "for a partial answer to the effects that @xmath982 has , we considered sbs again for the purely temporal problem without using the assumption that @xmath983 .",
    "we start with the equations , @xmath984 @xmath985 where @xmath986 , is the difference between the pump frequency and the scattered light frequency . here",
    "a@xmath987 are the mode amplitudes for the scattered light and ion acoustic waves respectively .",
    "two different dispersion relations are obtained , as expected , by obtaining equations for the evolution of average amplitude @xmath988 .",
    "the ion acoustic mode @xmath281 dispersion relation is not affected by magnitude of @xmath989 so that the growth rate , @xmath990 is a maximum when @xmath991 . on the other hand , the dispersion relation for @xmath725",
    "is modified so that the growth rate when @xmath992 , @xmath993 shows a stronger reduction with bandwidth than @xmath994 . here",
    "the maximum growth rate for @xmath725 occurs for a bandwidth dependent real frequency @xmath995 .",
    "thus , the threshold for mode @xmath996 is increased when @xmath997 by the ratio @xmath989 . the actual threshold for the coupled set viii.1 is , @xmath998",
    "this equation ( viii.4 ) is a generalization of eq .",
    "( vi.6 ) . in our example , the threshold is not increased when @xmath981 .    in our example , chosen for its relevance to laser fusion , the critical bandwidth to reach convective or absolute stability has been found to be 2 - 5% of the laser frequency .",
    "such a bandwidth is beyond the currently achievable with any icf laser system .",
    "however , novel techniques are being pursued that are capable of achieving these bandwidths[6 ] .",
    "in addition , there is the question of whether the average laser intensity or the larger hotspot intensity should be used in evaluating the thresholds .",
    "the use of the larger intensity would make the bandwidth requirements infeasible",
    ". however , if bandwidth is combined with a beam smoothing scheme , use of the mean intensity may be correct .",
    "recent calculations[66,67 ] have shown that , for at least one such scheme , isi , the use of the average intensity is justified .",
    "in addition to temporal bandwidth , there is also the effect of spatial incoherence produced by beam smoothing techniques that lead to a spread of wavevectors , @xmath9 . in the examples of backscatter considered previously in this section for temporal bandwidth",
    ", spatial incoherence will have little effect because @xmath999 where the f number of the focussing optic , f # , is typically large in icf applications .",
    "furthermore , the wavenumber spread will not increase the convective threshold because the effective bandwidth , @xmath1000 , is in general small compared to @xmath1001 , and @xmath3 .",
    "however absolute instabilities with significant wavevectors perpendicular to the laser propagation axis such as two plasmon decay may be influenced significantly by such a spread since there @xmath1002 will be the effective bandwidth .",
    "the work reported here is only a step in the application of a statistical theory to particular instabilities .",
    "further progress may require modifications or extensions to our work in order to remove some of the limitations of our approximations .",
    "we look forward to new developments in the theory and even more to the stimulus of experimental data .",
