    "the casimir effect is one of the most interesting manifestations of the nontrivial properties of the vacuum state in quantum field theory . since its first prediction by casimir in 1948 @xcite",
    "this effect has been investigated for various cases of boundary geometries and different fields ( see @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "historically , the investigation of the casimir effect for a perfectly conducting spherical shell was motivated by the casimir semiclassical model of an electron .",
    "it has been shown by boyer @xcite that the casimir energy for the sphere is positive , implying a repulsive force .",
    "this result was later reconsidered by a number of authors @xcite@xcite .",

    "recently , the casimir effect for spherical boundaries on de sitter and anti de sitter bulks is also investigated @xcite@xcite . in the investigations of the casimir effect",
    "the calculation of the local densities of the vacuum characteristics is of special interest . in particular , these include the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in addition to describing the physical structure of the quantum field at a given point , the energy - momentum tensor acts as the source of gravity in the einstein equations .",
    "it therefore plays an important role in modeling a self - consistent dynamics involving the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "investigation of the energy distribution inside a perfectly reflecting spherical shell was made in @xcite in the case of qed and in @xcite for qcd .",
