    "the jet terminal lobes of radio galaxies are gigantic inter - galactic structures consisting of magnetic fields and relativistic particles , both of which are supposed to be supplied by the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) through the jets .",
    "nevertheless , we do not yet know the relative importance of the magnetic fields and the relativistic particles in the mechanism of jet formation . to answer the issue",
    ", we need to measure spatial distributions of the field and particle energy densities along various locations of the agn - jet - lobe system .",
    "the relativistic electrons in the radio lobes interact with the magnetic fields and soft photons to produce synchrotron radiation and inverse - compton ( ic ) emission , respectively .",
    "feigelson et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter fea95 ) and kaneda et al .",
    "( 1995 , kea95 ) discovered the ic x - ray emission with _",
    "( trmper 1983 ) and _ asca _ ( tanaka et al . 1994 ) , respectively , from the lobes of the radio galaxy fornax  a ( ngc  1316 , redshift @xmath5 ; longhetti et al . 1998 ) , followed by authors reporting the lobe ic x - rays from centaurus  b ( pks  1343@xmath6601 ; tashiro et al .",
    "1998 ) , 3c  219 ( brunetti et al . 1999 ) and ngc  612 ( tashiro et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these authors estimated the energy density of soft photons , and succeeded in determining the magnetic field intensity and the energy densities of electrons in the lobes . among these pioneering results ,",
    "tashiro et al . (",
    "1998 ) and brunetti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , respectively , showed that the lobes of centaurus  b and 3c  219 exhibit clear dominance of particle energy , in their inner regions .",
    "notably , tashiro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found relative enhancements of the magnetic fields towards the periphery in the centaurus  b lobes .",
    "our next task is to resolve spatial distributions of the ic x - ray emission to trace the dynamics of the jet - lobe system .",
    "the lobes of centaurus  b , however , are not in fact the best target for this investigation with _ asca _ , because of the bright nucleus and the relatively small angular separation of its lobes . in this paper , we present results from _ asca _ follow up observations of the west lobe of fornax  a. this prototypical ic source is ideal for our purpose , because of its nearly dormant nucleus ( iyomoto et al .",
    "1998 ) , the large ( @xmath7 in radius ) angular size of its lobes , and the high integrated ic flux .",
    "in the first _ asca _ observation of fornax  a carried out on january 11 , 1994 , kea95 placed the nucleus at the center of the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "this was less efficient to observe the lobes because of the vignetting effect of the x - ray telescope ( xrt : serlemitsos et al .",
    "1993 ) , and , furthermore , some portion of the lobes fell outside the fov .",
    "aiming at the detail study of the lobe , we conducted follow up observations of fornax  a by placing the west lobe , which is less contaminated by point sources ( fea95 ; kea95 ; see also kim et al .",
    "1999 ) than the other , in the center of the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis : ohashi et al . 1996",
    "; makishima et al . 1996 ) fov .",
    "we concentrate on the gis data , since a fair amount of the lobe emission remained outside the @xmath8 fov of the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis : burke et al .",
    "1991 ; yamashita et al . 1997 ) at the _ 2-ccd _ mode .",
    "the observations were carried out on august 1718 and december 26  27 , 1997 . the good time exposure after standard data screening is 35 ks and 62 ks , for the august and december observations , respectively . including the observation in 1994 , the total exposure time amounts to 137 ks , which is more than four times as long as that obtained by kea95 .",
    "in figure  1 , we show 0.7  10 kev gis images obtained in the two observations in 1997 .",
    "we smoothed the raw images with a 2-dimensional gaussian function of @xmath9 , but left cosmic and intrinsic backgrounds in these images ( fig.1 ) .",
    "both two images show the diffuse ic emission over the west lobe region , as first revealed by fea95 and kea95 .",
    "the brightest and the second brightest discrete sources are , respectively , the host galaxy ngc  1316 and the sb galaxy ngc  1310 . besides a new transient source appeared on the second occasion to the southwest of the lobe , we see no significant variation of the sources in the fov .",
    "we therefore co - add the gis ( gis2+gis3 ) data from the present observations with those from the first one made in 1994 in order to study the ic x - ray emission with the best signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "for that purpose , we subtracted the intrinsic non - x - ray background ( nxb ) utilizing night earth exposures close in time to each observation , corrected the image ( containing the cosmic x - ray background , cxb , and the sources ) for the exposure and vignetting effect , and smoothed it with a 2-dimensional gaussian function of @xmath10 .",
    "the synthesized x - ray map is shown in figure  2 with gray scales , where the 1.4 ghz radio contours by ekers et al .",
    "( 1983 ) are overlaid .",
    "we detected four additional point - like source candidates ( labeled 1  4 ) with a threshold of 4 @xmath11 deviation above the average flux over the lobe region .",
    "apart from these small - scale features , we see the diffuse ic emission exhibiting a good coincidence with the radio lobe .",
    "we analyzed the _",
    "rosat_-pspc ( pfeffermann et al . 1986 ) archival data of these regions , and found that all the sources but the transient source were identified with the _ rosat _ data as point sources .",
    "the extrapolated 2  10 kev flux is higher than @xmath12w  m@xmath13 from their spectrum fitting results , and the derived energy indices range 1.5  3.2 .",
    "these soft x - ray spectra imply that the discrete sources do not originate from the possible local enhancements of the diffuse ic emission .",
    "we examined _ asca _ data for ngc  1310 and source 1  4 , and confirmed their intensities stayed constant within errors among these observations with _",
    "asca _ and _ rosat_. although the sources 1 and 2 are included in the region employed by kea95 for their spectrum analysis , the sum flux of these sources is not more than 1/10 of the flux reported by kea95 .",
    "the sources little affect their conclusion , assuming them to be stable .",
    "we accumulate the gis events over a circular region ( dashed circle in fig .",
    "2 ) around the x - ray brightness peak ( marked with a cross in fig .  2 ) .",
    "we limited the area within @xmath14 to avoid source contamination from the host galaxy ngc  1310 and source 2 , although the source 1 is inevitably contained in the integration region . since there is essentially no source - free region in the on - source fov , we estimated the background ( nxb + cxb ) utilizing archival blank - sky observations accumulated for 1653 ks . furthermore , we decomposed the background spectrum into the nxb and cxb components referring to the night earth data , and rescaled the nxb normalization to take into account the secular change in the nxb , by comparing the night earth spectrum between the epoch of the on - source observation ( in 1994 or 1997 ) and that of the blank - sky archival data ( mostly obtained in 1993 ) .",
    "we thus generated an appropriate background spectrum ( cxb plus rescaled nxb ) for each on - source observation , and subtracted it from the raw spectrum of each gis instrument .",
    "then we summed the gis spectra from the observations into a single one .    in figure  3 , we show the obtained background subtracted gis2 + gis3 spectrum of the west lobe region .",
    "it is relatively hard and significantly detected up to @xmath15 kev , implying a considerable improvement over results in kea95 .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with a model consisting of three components ; ( 1 ) a power - law with free energy index and free normalization , representing the ic emission ; ( 2 ) a thin - thermal emission ( raymond & smith 1977 ) with free temperature and free normalization , but with the metallicity fixed at 0.4 solar abundance , which represents the soft thermal emission surrounding the radio galaxy as detected by kea95 ; and ( 3 ) the contaminating source 1 .",
    "we analyzed the _",
    "rosat_-pspc spectrum of source 1 , and found that it can be described with a power - law of energy index @xmath16 and flux density @xmath17 @xmath18jy [ @xmath19w  m@xmath13hz@xmath20 at 1  kev , absorbed by a column density of @xmath21 h  atoms  m@xmath13 with @xmath22 . in the fit to the gis data , we constrained the component ( 3 ) to take these best - fit _ rosat _ parameters .",
    "we calculated the _",
    "response function for the three observations individually , and then took their weighted average .",
    "this three component model has successfully described the spectrum with @xmath23d.o.f .",
    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table 1 . the 2  10 kev flux obtained from the lobe region",
    "is @xmath25w  m@xmath13 , which is consistent with that evaluated by kea95 .",
    "the derived energy index of the ic component ( @xmath26 ) agrees with that obtained by kea95 ( @xmath27 ) , and the accuracy is much improved .",
    "a similar good fit was obtained by replacing the power - law component ( 1 ) with a second thin thermal plasma emission model , of temperature @xmath28 kev , emission measure of @xmath29m@xmath30 , and abundance fixed at 0.4 solar .",
    "we saw in figure  2 that the ic x - ray emission is relatively concentrated on the center of the lobe . to quantify the surface brightness distributions",
    ", we masked the contaminant discrete sources (   3.1 ) and made a 1.0  10 kev radial brightness profile around the x - ray brightness peak ( the cross in fig .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness distribution is so flat within a few arcmin that the radial profile is little sensitive to the position of the center ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "to compare with the x - ray radial profile around the same center , we made a radial brightness profile in radio utilizing the 1.4 ghz image by ekers et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , and show them in figure  4 .",
    "thus , the two profiles resemble each other , but differ in two points ; the rim - brightened feature seen in the radio profile is absent in x - rays , and the x - ray distribution appears to have a larger radius than the radio distribution .    to examine possible instrument artifacts ,",
    "we simulated an expected x - ray image with the xrt and gis response simulator to fit the observed radial brightness profile . the position resolution and vignetting effect of",
    "were calculated based on calibration data from cygnus x-1 ( ikebe 1995 ; takahashi et al .",
    "we assume isotropic distribution of the emissivity through the simulation .",
    "this analysis revealed that a homogeneously filled spherical emissivity model with the outer boundary of @xmath31 reproduces the observed x - ray radial profile very well ( the solid line in the fig .",
    "on the other hand , a shell - shaped emissivity model reproduced the rim brightened radio profile very well , as represented with a dashed line in figure  4 .",
    "the outer boundary of the shell is constrained to be @xmath32 , while the inner boundary @xmath33 . the shell - shaped model , however , could not describe the obtained x - ray profile with a finite inner boundary .",
    "therefore , unlike the case of x - ray emissivity , the radio profile requires a reduced emissivity at the lobe center , although we see no significant discrepancy between the derived outer boundaries of the x - ray and radio profiles .",
    "since the radio data provided better accuracy , we regard the value of @xmath34 derived from radio data as the common outer boundary of radio and x - rays in discussion below .",
    "we measured the diffuse x - rays of the fornax  a west lobe with an improved accuracy employing the _ asca _ follow up observations .",
    "the diffuse emission spatially coincides with the radio synchrotron lobe on a large scale .",
    "the derived 0.710 kev spectrum of the lobe x - rays is well described with a power - law model , whose energy index of @xmath26 agrees with the synchrotron radio emission energy index , @xmath1 , derived from published radio fluxes observed at 408 mhz , 1.4 ghz , and 2.7 ghz ( cameron 1971 ; ekers et al . 1983 ; shimmins 1971 , respectively ) .",
    "although the obtained spectrum formally accepts a thin thermal plasma model , the high temperature ( @xmath35 kev ) will allow neither gravitational confinement nor cooling flow to explain the emission .",
    "the derived emission measure requires a thermal pressure of @xmath36 j  m@xmath30 .",
    "if we assume a magnetic field of @xmath37 nt to confine the possible thermal plasma , that field will reduce the synchrotron cooling time down to @xmath38 yr ( iyomoto et al .",
    "this is too short for the relativistic electrons to diffuse in the whole lobes , considering the estimated growth speeds of lobes ( scheuer 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , we reconfirm , with a higher accuracy , that the diffuse x - ray emission is produced via the ic process in which the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons are boosted by the synchrotron electrons , as fea95 and kea95 concluded .    with the follow up observations pointing on the west lobe , we examined the brightness distribution of the ic x - ray emission , and revealed that it indicates a center - filled emissivity distribution in contrast to the rim - brightening radio shape .",
    "this indicates that the relativistic electrons homogeneously in the sphere of radius @xmath39 kpc @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the hubble constant normalized to @xmath42 .",
    "we therefore regard the rim brightened radio emission as a direct indicator of the magnetic pressure distribution , represented with a shell of inner and outer boundaries of @xmath43kpc @xmath44 and @xmath39kpc @xmath45 , respectively . on the basis of the spectral and spatial analysis , we evaluate the energy densities of magnetic field ( @xmath46 ) and electrons ( @xmath47 ) according to harris and grindlay ( 1979 ) . since @xmath46 is determined by the ratio of the synchrotron radio flux to the ic x - ray flux emitted from the same volume",
    ", @xmath46 is in inverse proportion to the volume ratio of the shell to the electron filled sphere , which is @xmath48 .",
    "we estimate the 1.4 ghz flux falling inside the x - ray integration region as 50 jy ( @xmath49w  s@xmath50m@xmath13 ) , based on the radio map by ekers et al .",
    "we then calculate @xmath46 after harris and grindlay ( 1979 ) , considering the filling factor ( @xmath51 ) to the shell region , and assuming the magnetic fields to have random directions to the line of sight .",
    "the result is @xmath52 j  m@xmath30 .",
    "the derived @xmath46 corresponds to the magnetic field strength of @xmath53 nt at @xmath54 .",
    "note here we adopted an ic scattering electron density , at lorentz factor @xmath55 , estimated through extrapolation from the observed synchrotron spectrum at @xmath56  13000 . utilizing equation ( 10 ) of harris and grindlay ( 1979 ) , we also derive @xmath47 in the sphere .",
    "we assume that the electron lorentz factor ranges @xmath57 in calculation below , as kea95 adopted .",
    "thus we obtained @xmath47 from the estimated ic x - ray flux ( table 1 ) as @xmath58 j  m@xmath30 .",
    "although the derived @xmath46 is nominally larger than the @xmath59 by a factor of 2.3 in the shell , we can not immediately reject electon - magnetic field equipartition ( @xmath60 ) there , without determining the electron energy spectrum below @xmath56 .",
    "if the spectrum turns down just below @xmath61 , the estimated @xmath62 . on the contrary , assuming that the spectrum extends down to @xmath63 ( @xmath64 mhz in synchrotron emission ) , the integrated @xmath47 becomes equivalent to @xmath46 in the shell region .",
    "the results obtained here suggest a picture that the lobe interior is dominated by the particle pressure , whereas the magnetic field pressure becomes significant in the shell region defined by the lobe boundary .",
    "interestingly , we see a similar situation in the lobes of centaurus  b ( pks  1343@xmath6601 ) , as tashiro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed .",
    "the similarity is thought to reflect energetics and evolutions of radio lobes ( e.g. blundell & rawlings 2000 ) and the inter - galactic environments of particle and magnetic fields .",
    "further investigation with recent advanced x - ray observatories are expected .",
