    "since the discovery of high-@xmath12 cuprate with its perovskite structure , a large number of measurements of thermal conductivity @xmath16 have been reported up to date , giving crucial information about transport properties in the superconducting and normal states@xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity of solids is usually separated into the phonon and electronic components @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . for high-@xmath12 copper oxide superconductors yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5(ybco ) ,",
    "bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath19 and tl@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath19 , a rapid enhancement in @xmath20 is observed below @xmath12 , with decreasing @xmath21 , then @xmath20 reaches a maximum around a half of @xmath12 and finally shows a monotonous decrease at low temperatures .",
    "tewordt et al .",
    "ascribed the origin of the anomaly to the phonon contribution @xmath17 on the basis of the classical theory of thermal transport in superconductors @xcite . on the contrary , yu et al .",
    "have proposed a new interpretation of the anomalous enhancement in @xmath20 as being responsible for the electron contribution @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "following their proposal , a strong suppression in the quasiparticle scattering rate below @xmath12 causes the @xmath20 anomaly , which is consistent with an observed peak in measurements of microwave conductivity in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field effect on the thermal conductivity in high-@xmath12 superconductors enables us to examine the scattering processes of thermal carriers due to magnetic vortex lines @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors developed a two component method to analyze the field dependence of the thermal conductivity and concluded that only the electronic contribution is field sensitive . in a similar way , a procedure to check the linear field dependence of inverse electronic thermal conductivity was proposed by pogorelov et al .",
    ". however , the origin of the anomalous peak in @xmath20 and its field dependence are still open questions .    in this paper , we present measurements of the in - plane thermal conductivity @xmath11 of sm - substituted single crystals ( y@xmath1,sm@xmath2)ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6=0 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.0 ) as functions of temperature and magnetic field . to our knowledge",
    ", no measurement of thermal conductivity has been performed on a - site substituted single crystals ybco except for polycrystalline samples @xcite . here , we give some comments on the substitution effect of sm ion on the crystal growth of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 . in a previous work , the substitution of sm for y led to a high growth rate for single crystal growth , which is about two times greater with a sm content @xmath6=0.12 than that of ybco @xcite . moreover , by controlling the sm content , one obtained high superconductivity for sm substituted ybco .    the @xmath13 profile is fitted using the electron contribution model , to estimate the mean free path of quasi particles @xmath14 near a half of @xmath12 in the absence of field @xcite .",
    "compared with the linear field dependence of the inverse @xmath18 , the square - root fit to the @xmath13data is applied .",
    "in addition , we discuss the impurity substitution effect on the thermal conduction of large single crystals yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "a series of single crystalline ( y@xmath1,sm@xmath2)ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6=0 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.0 ) and yba@xmath3(cu@xmath7zn@xmath8)@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath9=0.0071 ) were grown by the crystal pulling method .",
    "sm contents range from 0 , 0.1(0.119),0.2(0.215 ) and 1.0 .",
    "as - grown crystals with @xmath6=0 , 0.1 , 0.2 and @xmath9(zn)=0.0071 were annealed at @xmath22c in the oxygen atmosphere ( for 1 to 2 weeks)to achieve the optimal @xmath12 with @xmath23 , as shown in fig.[mt ] .",
    "smba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( smbco ) crystal was oxidized at @xmath24c for 200h , giving a higher @xmath12 property .",
    "the slight degradation in @xmath12 for smbco probably arises from the partial substitution of sm for ba site rather than oxygen defects because we annealed it in the oxygen atmosphere for a very long time .",
    "the oxygen content for the as - grown crystal with @xmath6=0 was estimated to be @xmath25 using the iodometric analysis on one piece cut from the same batch .",
    "sample preparations are described by yao et al.in @xcite .",
    "sample dimensions are typically 4.5@xmath263.1 mm@xmath27 in the @xmath28-plane and 1.7 mm along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the epma analysis showed that sm ion is uniformly distributed in single crystals .",
    "the inductively coupled plasma ( icp ) technique revealed that single crystalline samples used in our measurements are close to the nominal compositions .",
    "measurements of the thermal conductivity , in the @xmath28-plane and along the @xmath10-axis , were done with a conventional steady - state heat - flow method@xcite . the magnetic field effect on the @xmath28-plane thermal conductivity",
    "was examined in the application of fields up to 14 t along the @xmath10-axis at the tsukuba magnet laboratory , the national institute for materials science and at the high field laboratory for superconducting materials , institute for materials research , tohoku university .",
    "a temperature gradient across the sample was determined using a differential - type chromel - constantan thermocouple after a calibration procedure .",
    "the magnetization measurement was carried out using the squid magnetometer .",
    "the temperature variation of the resistivity was measured on the identical samples using a four - probe technique .",
    "the in - plane thermal conductivity @xmath11 for single crystals ( y@xmath1,sm@xmath2)ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6=0 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.0 ) and yba@xmath3(cu@xmath7zn@xmath8)@xmath4o@xmath5 ( y=0.0071 ) is shown as a function of temperature in fig.[kt ] . for comparison , the out - of - plane thermal conductivity @xmath29with @xmath6=0 and 1.0 is also depicted in the fig.[kt ] . for the identical crystals used for our experiment , measurements of the low - field magnetization and the in - plane resistivity are presented in fig.[mt ] , to check the superconducting properties .",
    "the resistivity data for the lightly zn doped sample will be shown in the inset of fig.3(b ) .",
    "first of all , the @xmath11 of ( y@xmath1,sm@xmath2)ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 showed a rapid enhancement upon crossing @xmath12 with decreasing temperature , while for @xmath29 no remarkable variation was detected near @xmath12 .",
    "the substitution of y by sm strongly suppresses a maximum of @xmath30 from 160 mw / cmk at @xmath6=0 down to 50 mw / cmk at @xmath6=0.2 through 85 mw / cmk at @xmath6=0.1 .",
    "however , the pronounced peak of @xmath11 below @xmath12 is still observed even for the @xmath6=0.2 crystal with its low thermal value . for the smbco crystal , @xmath11 exhibits a low thermal conductivity accompanied by the broad maximum near 40k .",
    "this finding is closely related to a local lattice distortion due to the slight substitution of sm for ba as mentioned before . for free ions ,",
    "the effective moment of sm@xmath31 is 0.85 @xmath32 and it is much smaller than the value of other rare earth ions ( 3.62 @xmath32 for nd@xmath31 and 7.96 @xmath32 for gd@xmath31 ) .",
    "if the phonon scattering due to magnetic ions with the smaller moment is assumed to be in the presence of the crystal field for smbco , it will contribute a suppression observed in @xmath11 to some extent .",
    "now , we comment on @xmath16 in the normal state for the superconducting crystals .",
    "the thermal conductivity is separated into the electronic and phonon components .",
    "first , the electronic thermal conductivity in the normal state @xmath33 is estimated from the resistivity data using the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law @xmath34 with a lorentz number @xmath352.45@xmath36w@xmath37k@xmath38 .",
    "for all superconducting crystals , the estimated value @xmath33 is almost independent of @xmath21 because of the @xmath21 linear dependence of @xmath39 , as shown in fig.[ke](a ) .",
    "accordingly , when @xmath40 gives rise to the phonon component @xmath41 , the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath42 observed represents that of the phonon component in the normal state @xcite .    for comparison ,",
    "let us show in fig.[ke](b ) the @xmath11 data for the corresponding as - grown crystals of ( y@xmath1,sm@xmath2)ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6=0 and 0.1 ) and yba@xmath3(cu@xmath7zn@xmath8)@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath9=0.0071 ) . in the inset of fig.3(b ) , the as - grown @xmath39 data for the zn - doped sample are presented and the electronic component @xmath33 is neglected from the wf law using its resistivity data . for other as - grown crystals , we also expect an insulating property or a weakly metallic one with high resistivity .",
    "we note that the as - grown crystals for our experiment were prepared at least under the similar crystal growth environment .",
    "accordingly , we conclude that for all as - grown crystals used , @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath11 at @xmath6=0 follows a weakly @xmath44-like behavior , while for the sm - substituted crystal it is almost independent on @xmath21 .",
    "this finding is probably caused by the enhanced phonon scattering due to the sm substitution . here , at high temperatures , the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath42 of the as - grown crystal",
    "is expressed as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are thermal resistances due to defect scattering and phonon - phonon umklapp scattering , respectively .",
    "moreover , for the light zn doping for the as - grown sample we observed a similar @xmath21 dependence of @xmath16 as that in the pure sample , indicating that a small amount of zn - impurity does not affect the phonon thermal conduction .",
    "in contrast , the light zn doping for the superconducting crystal strongly suppresses @xmath12 down to 80k through the superconducting pair breaking , resulting in a reduced peak in @xmath42 in fig.[kt](a)@xcite .",
    "we notice a common trend in the temperature dependence of phonon component between as - grown and superconducting samples .",
    "for example , @xmath42 of both as - grown and oxygen - annealed samples with @xmath6=0 shows a weakly @xmath44-like behavior at high-@xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the oxygen content does not affect the @xmath21 dependence of @xmath17 strongly except for highly insulating crystal yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath48(@xmath49 ) @xcite .",
    "accordingly , let us assume that a minor modification of @xmath42 of as - grown crystals expresses the temperature variation of the phonon component below @xmath12 for superconducting crystals if we ascribe the @xmath16 peak to the electronic contribution . thus , the original @xmath16 data for as - grown crystals are scaled to coincide with @xmath40 for the corresponding superconducting crystals at high temperatures ( 150k ) .",
    "the solid and dashed curves in fig.[kt ]  represent the phonon contribution and , at the selected temperature of 40k , we obtain 43 @xmath50 at @xmath51 0 , 55 @xmath50 at @xmath52 0.1 and 71 @xmath50 at @xmath9(zn)=0.0071 .",
    "( the corresponding electronic component is listed in table 1 ) this rough estimation in @xmath17 is comparable with the value ( @xmath53 near @xmath12/2 for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath54 ) evaluated by takenaka et al . , @xcite .",
    "separately , a primitive estimation on the phonon component of an untwinned crystal ybco with @xmath12=90.5k gives a similar value @xcite .",
    "next , we show in the fig.[kh ] the magnetic field dependence of the in - plane thermal conductivity @xmath55 of single crystals ( y@xmath1,sm@xmath2)ba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6=0 , 0.1 and 1.0 ) and yba@xmath3(cu@xmath7zn@xmath8)@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath9=0.0071 ) .",
    "the @xmath55 data are normalized by the zero field value . at low fields ,",
    "the value of @xmath11 exhibits a rapid drop around nearly @xmath12/2 and it then tends to saturate at high fields up to 14 t. the applied field causes a substantial decrease in @xmath56 by @xmath57 at @xmath6=0 , while @xmath56 of sm - substituted samples shows a smaller degradation from @xmath58 at @xmath6=0.1 to @xmath59 at @xmath6=1.0 .",
    "in the mixed state of conventional superconductors , we believe that thermal carriers ( quasiparticles and phonons ) are scattered by the magnetic vortices , resulting in a substantial decrease in @xmath16 .",
    "now , we try to fit the @xmath55 data to the electronic contribution model @xcite .",
    "the electronic thermal conductivity in magnetic fields , @xmath60 , is rewritten using both @xmath61and @xmath14 as follows ; @xmath62    here , the total mean free path of quasiparticles is expressed such as @xmath63 , where @xmath14 and @xmath64 are the mean free path of quasiparticles in zero field and in sufficiently strong fields , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the field dependence of the thermal conductivity , @xmath65,is fitted using the following formula @xmath66 , where we set @xmath67 as @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for @xmath70=1 and 0.5 , respectively ( @xmath71 , the quantum flux ) . in the case of @xmath72",
    ", @xmath73 represents a scattering cross section per vortex cores in transport @xcite . when the quasiparticle scattering from vortex cores is proportional to the number of the magnetic quantum flux , we get @xmath74=@xmath75@xcite . thus , for the exponent @xmath70=1 in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , we take into account for the mean free path of quasiparticles @xmath76 from the scattering due to vortex cores , in addition to @xmath14 for scattering processes in the meissner state . using the @xmath73 = 90 @xmath77 in ybco @xcite",
    ", @xmath76 is @xmath78 t@xmath79 . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath70=0.5 , assuming the quasiparticle scattering due to screening currents around vortex cores in a disordered vortex array , the vortex contribution @xmath76 is proportional to the average lattice constant of a vortex lattice @xmath80 i.e. , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a constant independent of fields @xcite . using @xmath82=0.5 in @xcite , @xmath76 becomes @xmath83 t@xmath84 .",
    "our reliable fits of the @xmath13 data to eq.([fit ] ) give the two parameters , @xmath85(=1-@xmath86 ) and @xmath87 , at selected temperatures as summarized in table 1 .",
    "it is truly that our fitting procedures yield a better fit for the @xmath72 than that for the @xmath88 , but it is difficult to distinguish a @xmath89-linear or @xmath90-dependence in the denominator of @xmath13 in fig.[kh ] . in @xmath89-linear fits , we notice the underestimation in electron component for all crystals if we accept the phonon component estimated from the as - grown data . for example , in the pure crystal of @xmath6=0 , the @xmath89-linear fit yields @xmath91 , while in the @xmath90 fit we get @xmath92 .",
    "this tendency in @xmath18 below @xmath12 appears in previous works on the field dependences of @xmath13 for underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath93 and tl@xmath3ba@xmath3cuo@xmath94@xcite .",
    "such the underestimation in @xmath18 will enable us to consider a significant modification of the free - electron lorenz number in the wf law for the strongly electron correlated system such as high- @xmath12 cuprates , giving the reduced electron thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "finally , let us examine the fitting parameter @xmath95 listed in table[table1 ] . from @xmath96",
    ", we obtain the mean free path of quasiparticles @xmath97 m for @xmath70=1 at the pure crystal . here",
    ", we used the cross section of @xmath73 = 90 @xmath77 in ybco @xcite . in a similar way , for the @xmath70=0.5 , @xmath98 m with @xmath82=0.5 in @xcite .",
    "both the former and latter fits give @xmath991000@xmath100 at 40k for pure @xmath6=0 crystal .",
    "from table[table1 ] , we guess that @xmath14 at the sm substituted crystal is about one - third as long as the value of @xmath14 of the pure crystal , whether we use the @xmath89-linear fit or the @xmath90 . if the normal state @xmath101 is proportional to @xmath102 at @xmath103 , then the @xmath33 plots in fig.[ke](a)give the ratio of @xmath14 at @xmath6=0.1 to that at @xmath6=0 @xmath104 at higher @xmath21 , this value is not far from the above results in the @xmath14 ratio ( @xmath105 ) around a half of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , for the lightly zn - doped crystal , our fits to the data indicate the reduced mean free path of quasiparticles .",
    "a pair - breaking effect due to zn - doping makes quasiparticles increase , giving the strongly electron - electron scattering enhanced below @xmath12 .",
    "this finding has a close relationship with the reduced peak observed in @xmath30 of yba@xmath3(cu@xmath7zn@xmath8)@xmath4o@xmath5 with y=0.0071 .",
