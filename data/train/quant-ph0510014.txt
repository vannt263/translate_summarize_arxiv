    ", we will study the gate error as a function of the rotation angle @xmath4 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath72 .",

    ", we finally obtain a system depending only on the parameter @xmath72 . by solving it numerically",
    ", we obtain an estimation of the adiabatic error as a function of @xmath72 and of @xmath4 .",
    "note that the error does not depend on the axis of rotation .",
    "indeed , the choice of the axis of rotation only determines the relation of the basis of logical states to the basis of adiabatic eigenstates , and since the error is obtained by maximizing over all initial states , this choice has no effect on its value . the error as a function of @xmath72 for different values of the angle @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figdiffrot ] . for each value of @xmath4 , we observe two characteristic regimes .",
    "the first one , where @xmath72 is small , is characterized by a damped oscillatory behaviour as a function of @xmath72 , leading also to a non - monotonous variation of the error with the rotation angle . in the second one ,",
    "the error decreases continuously with @xmath72 , and greater values of @xmath4 lead to larger errors .    in order to minimize the error due to non - adiabaticity",
    ", @xmath80 should thus be as large as possible .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that @xmath2 corresponds to the time of the gate and thus has to be much shorter than the decoherence time of the qubit states , in order to limit errors due to decoherence . in principle",
    "one can be in the adiabatic regime even for very short gate times , provided that the detuning @xmath1 is made large enough .",
    "however , this requires an increase in the laser amplitude @xmath81 , in order to still achieve the same rotation angle @xmath4 .",
    "this relationship is contained in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) and fig .",
    "[ figx ] , which show that for fixed @xmath72 the rotation angle is determined by @xmath57 , i.e. the ratio of @xmath81 and @xmath1 at maximum laser intensity .",
    "if one decreases @xmath2 and increases @xmath1 , keeping @xmath72 and thus the level of error constant , one therefore has to increase @xmath81 by the same factor as @xmath1 , in order to keep the rotation angle constant .",
    "since the laser intensity can not be made arbitrarily large , this imposes an upper bound on @xmath1 , and thus a lower bound on @xmath2 . from fig .",
    "[ figdiffrot ] one can see that for @xmath82 , the error is significantly less than @xmath83 , which should be small enough for fault tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in this section we will investigate the error introduced to the raman single - qubit gates by the finite lifetime of the excited state @xmath8 due to spontaneous emission .",
    "we will begin with a fairly simple argument that gives the correct behaviour for the error , before presenting more precise numerical calculations in the next subsection .    as described before ,",
    "the two adiabatic basis states that are significantly populated during the gate operation are @xmath84 and @xmath24 .",
    "the state @xmath84 has no contribution from the excited state and is thus unaffected by spontaneous emission . on the other hand , the state @xmath85 has a component in the excited state @xmath8 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) , we can see that the population in the unstable state @xmath8 is therefore @xmath86 .",
    "defining @xmath87 as the spontaneous decay rate of the state @xmath8 , we can then estimate the population @xmath88 transferred by spontaneous emission during the gate operation as follows :    @xmath89    let us assume that we are in the adiabatic regime ( @xmath90 ) , and that the overall error due to spontaneous emission is small .",
    "the first of these conditions implies that @xmath57 and thus @xmath91 is small , cf .",
    "the second one implies that @xmath92 is nearly constant .",
    "( [ eqdelta ] ) can then be simplified to @xmath93 where we have again introduced the dimensionless function @xmath77 defined above .",
    "furthermore , in the same regime , eq . ( [ lambda ] )",
    "can be simplified to @xmath94 choosing @xmath95 in order to obtain an upper bound , we find the following expression for the total transferred population due to spontaneous emission : @xmath96 the error induced by spontaneous emission is twofold ; on the one hand , a new distribution of the populations @xmath97 , and on the other hand , a dephasing between the two qubit basis states .",
    "the transferred population @xmath88 provides an estimate for the gate error due to spontaneous emission .",
    "it may seem surprising that @xmath88 does not depend on the gate time @xmath2 , even though for longer gate times the component of the system in the excited state has more time to decay .",
    "the reason for this is that for the same rotation angle shorter gate times require larger populations in the excited state , and the two effects cancel out exactly , at least within the framework of the above estimate .",
    "we are now going to use numerical computation to obtain more precise results on the gate errors .      in order to study the effects of spontaneous emission on the raman gate protocol in detail",
    ", we use the master equation formalism . in the present section ,",
    "we assume for simplicity that the spontaneous emission can only occur from the state @xmath8 toward the two qubit states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and not to any additional states .",
    "to take this decay into account , we introduce the lindblad operators :    @xmath98    with @xmath99 ( for @xmath100 ) .",
    "the constants @xmath101 are the decay rates from @xmath102 towards the states @xmath103 .",
    "the total decay rate is thus given by @xmath104 .",
    "the master equation @xcite is : @xmath105   +    \\sum_{i }   \\left ( 2l_{i}\\rho l^{+}_{i}-\\left\\{l^{+}_{i}l_{i},\\rho \\right\\}\\right).\\ ] ] for quantum gate operations , the initial state @xmath106 is always a linear combination of the two logical states @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "the master equation corresponds to a set of coupled differential equations for the elements of the density matrix that can be solved numerically .",
    "this allows us to determine the gate error defined in eq .",

    "in this subsection , we describe the numerical results for a particular case in detail , comparing the situations with and without spontaneous emission .",
    "this is intended to serve as an introduction and illustration for our more general results presented in the next subsection .",

    "while these values could apply to conceivable experiments with quantum dots @xcite , we have also chosen them such that the relevant effects are clearly visible .",
    "for these values @xmath117 .",

    "the state @xmath24 has a component of order @xmath128 in the state @xmath8 , the population in the excited state therefore grows until the maximum of the light intensity is reached , and then returns to zero .",

    "phonon - related errors can be made essentially arbitrarily small by making the gate operation slower .",

    "the slower the operation , the less energy is available , restricting the available state space for phonon creation .",
    "unfortunately there is no corresponding energy constraint for spontaneous emission , since the energy for photon creation is provided by the decay of the emitter to one of the low - lying states .",
    "our results show explicitly that slowing down the gate operation is not helpful to reduce errors in the present context , see fig .",

    "of course , the gate time always has to be much shorter than the decoherence time of superpositions of the qubit states .",
