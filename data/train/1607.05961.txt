    "we observe activities low in the solar atmosphere including filament eruptions , flares , large - scale coronal euv waves , and coronal dimmings .",
    "euv waves are large - scale disturbances propagating through the solar atmosphere , observed as moving fronts of increased coronal euv emission .",
    "they propagate at typical speeds of 200400kms@xmath1 @xcite but on rare occasions , euv wave events with speeds in excess of 1000kms@xmath1 have been reported @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the nature of euv waves , falling into three categories : wave , non - wave and hybrid models .",
    "most wave models interpret the propagating signatures as fast - mode magnetosonic waves @xcite , while in the non - wave models they are explained as disturbances due to sucessive restructuring of magnetic field lines during the erupting cme @xcite .",
    "hybrid models include both interpretations resulting in a bimodal picture , where a fast - mode wave travels ahead of a slower inner component due to magnetic field reconfiguration caused by the erupting cme @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion on the various theories and the evidence for and against them may be found in recent reviews ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the relationship between cmes and euv waves was investigated by several statistical studies @xcite .",
    "it was found that fast and wide cmes are in general accompanied by well - observed euv waves that are associated with shocks , i.e. related to type ii radio bursts @xcite .",
    "the unprecedented multi vantage - point observations from the _ solar terrestrial relations observatory _ ( stereo , * ? ? ?",

    "( sdo , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) improved our understanding of how the euv wave formation and kinematics are related to the cme dynamics .",
    "initially the euv wave front is found to be closely attached to the laterally expanding cme flanks .",
    "after an impulsive driving phase , the cme flanks decelerate , and the euv wave subsequently becomes freely propagating with a velocity close to the fast magnetosonic speed in the quiet corona @xcite .",
    "quadrature observations of the two stereo spacecraft unambiguously revealed that the euv wave is propagating ahead of and is driven by the laterally expanding cme flanks @xcite .",
    "these findings were also confirmed by mhd simulations of cme eruptions and associated euv waves @xcite .",
    "coronal dimmings are regions of reduced emission in the low corona observed in euv @xcite and soft x - rays ( sxr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the appearance of these dimming regions is in general interpreted as density depletion caused by the evacuation of plasma during the cme expansion @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the simulatenous and co - spatial observations of coronal dimmings in different wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectroscopic observations showing plasma outflows in dimming regions @xcite and studies on dimming / cme mass relations @xcite . in the literature , two different types of dimmings are defined , core ( or twin ) dimmings and secondary ( or remote ) dimmings , respectively .",
    "core dimmings are stationary , localized regions that are often present on both sides of an erupting configuration , in opposite magnetic polarity regions . in relatively simple cases",
    "they are interpreted to mark the footpoints of the ejected fluxrope @xcite .",
    "the more shallow secondary dimmings are diffuse and can extend to significant distances from the source region .",
    "they are often observed to follow behind a propagating euv wavefront @xcite .",
    "therefore , they could be rarefaction regions that develop behind a compressive wave ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or formed due to the plasma evacuation behind the flux rope and overlying fields that are erupting . in this paper , we analyze the flare - cme event and associated large - scale euv wave that occurred on .",
    "several aspects of this event have been studied before .",
    "for instance , @xcite investigated the euv wave kinematics using high - cadence observations from sdo / aia , and determined this event to be a high - speed euv wave with a velocity of @xmath31250kms@xmath1 . only 6 out of 171 events",
    "reported by @xcite were identified in this high - speed regime ( @xmath41200kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "the globally propagating euv wave caused oscillations of filaments and the launch of a jet @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that euv waves may serve as agents for linking successive solar activities .",
    "@xcite focused on the triggering mechanism of the erupting event using mhd simulations initialized by a non - linear force - free field ( nlfff ) extrapolation .",
    "@xcite studied the morphology and time evolution of photosperic traces of the current density and flare ribbons and compared it with the topological features found by nlfff modeling .",
    "both , @xcite and @xcite identified a spine - fan configuration of the overlying field lines , due to the presence of a parasitic positive polarity , embedding an elongated flux rope .",
    "the energy accumulation of the flare and the accompanied cme was studied by @xcite .",
    "they found that the calculated free magnetic energy is able to power the flare and the cme , and that both phenomena may consume a similar amount of free energy .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the source active region ( noaa 11283 ) in relation to its recurrent flaring and cme activity .",
    "they found that before the occurence of the x2.1 flare - cme event under study here , the shearing motions seem to inject a larger fraction of energy into the corona than the emergence of the magnetic field .",
    "in this paper , we investigate this extraordinary euv wave and associated flare - cme event in detail and fully exploit the quadrature view from sdo and stereo .",
    "on 2011 september 6 , a globally propagating high - speed euv wave occurred in association with an x2.1 flare - cme event in noaa active region 11283 , at heliographic position n14@xmath5w18@xmath5 ( cf .",

    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that there are only small projection effects for measurements above the limb in st - a imagery .",
    "the eruption site is located behind the limb for stereo - b(ehind ) ( st - b ) , hence data from this vantage point are not included in our analysis . to study the euv wave ,",

    "\\1 ) for the first time we identified the  disappearance \" of a segment of the euv wave front followed by its reappearance and further propagation in the absence of any obvious magnetic structures . in the following we discuss three possible scenarios for this phenomenon :    \\i ) heating at the wave front : @xcite studied the strong euv wave associated with the x2.2 flare of 2011 february 15 and showed that the passing euv front adiabatically compresses the ambient coronal plasma , resulting in an increase in density of about 6 - 9% and an associated temperature increase of 5 - 6% . using the method described in @xcite , we estimated for the event under study the intensity ratio for each aia channel as a function of temperature , by assuming that the passing euv wave causes @xmath28% increase in density compared to the pre - event corona ( consistent with the values derived by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to a @xmath25% increase in temperature . from the estimated intensity ratios we obtain that for a @xmath25% increase in temperature ,",
    "the intensity in the 171    and 193    channels is reducing while that of 211    and 335    channels continue to increase .",
    "we repeated this test for different densities ranging from 6 - 12% increase and obtained the same qualitative results in all cases .",
    "this is contradictory to the observed evolution of the amplitude of the wave pulse revealing a decrease in intensity for all four wavelength channels during its `` disappearance '' phase ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude ] ) .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the disappearance being caused by heating at the wave front .",
    "\\ii ) wave propagation through an inhomogenous medium : euv waves are known to be affected by inhomogeneities in the corona ( in terms of alfvn velocity ) , such as active regions , coronal holes or filaments .",
    "encountering a region of high alfvn speed would alter the amplitude of the wave pulse . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we checked for magnetic obstacles in sdo / hmi los magnetograms along the propagation path , which would correspond to regions of enhanced alfvn speed .",

    "we note that the wave front passage causes the filament to oscillate , but it does not erupt @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the propagation through an inhomogenous medium is not responsible for the disappearance of the wave front .",
    "\\iii ) los effects : the simultaneous decrease in amplitude for all channels indicates that the decrease in emission results primarily from changes in the density and not changes in temperature . the 171   , 193   , and 211    filters reveal the highest decrease .",
    "these channels are most sensitive to temperatures around 1 - 2  mk , which corresponds to quiet sun coronal temperatures . during the cme lift - off such plasma",

    "they are located in regions of opposite magnetic polarities and lie close to the eruption site ( cf .",
    "[ dimming ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these regions point to real footpoints of the erupting fluxrope . for the secondary / remote dimmings ( red roi and lower part of the cyan ellipse in fig .",
    "[ dimming_los ] ) the reconstruction of the emission from st - a revealed that whether the observed intensity in sdo / aia results in a dimming or not , depends strongly on the structures lying along the corresponding los .",
    "we conclude that projection effects play an important role in the appearance and correct interpretation of coronal dimming regions .",
    "3 ) the kinematical evolution of the wave is derived to be different when measured from different vantage points .",
    "this can be explained by projection effects as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stereo ] . obviously , the on - disk wave signatures cover contributions from the outermost bright front of the cme eruption , when the euv wave is not yet detached from the cme which is driving the wave . @xcite and @xcite found that there exist viewing angles , where the orientation of the los is tangential to the erupting dome , producing visible features that can be interpreted as parts of an euv wave . in a recent study by @xcite , using different techniques for deriving the altitude of an euv wave , the resulting heights span a distance range of 34154  mm above the solar limb , which is consistent with our result of @xmath2130  mm for the peak of the wave pulse identified from sdo / aia .",
    "another important aspect is that the on - disk observations of euv waves may contain significant intensity contributions of the emission from the expanding cme body integrated along the los over several scale heights .",
    "the speeds of the euv wave ( as derived from sdo / aia ) and the cme ( derived from st - a with low projection effects ) are similar , implying that in both instances we measure the same propagating structure .",
    "in addition , the observed `` bending '' of the wave towards the solar east ( see movie no 1 .",
    "time range @xmath2  22:24  ut until 22:30  ut ) , is another feature suggestive of projection effects , as no magnetic obstacles are present at that location , that would cause a reflection or change of propagation direction . assuming that the `` bending '' results from los integration along the outermost front of the cme , we derive that these contributions might come from large heights in the corona . for the time when the wave `` bending '' is clearly observed , the apex of the cme , as derived from st - a , is at a distance of about  @xmath28  r@xmath29 .",

    "<S> we exploit the multi - point quadrature position of sdo and stereo - a , to make a thorough analysis of the euv wave evolution , with respect to its kinematics and amplitude evolution and reconstruct the sdo line - of - sight ( los ) direction of the identified coronal dimming regions in stereo - a . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed intensities of the dimming regions in sdo / aia depend on the structures that are lying along their los and are the combination of their individual intensities , e.g. the expanding cme body , the enhanced euv wave and cme front . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the intermittent disappearance of the euv wave in the aia 171 , 193 , 211    filters , which are channels sensitive to plasma with temperatures below @xmath2 2  mk is also caused by such los integration effects . these observations clearly demonstrate that single - view image data provide us with limited insight to correctly interpret coronal features . </S>"
