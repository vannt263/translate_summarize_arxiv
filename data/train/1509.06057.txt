    "currently , the prediction of time series has played an important role in many science fields of practical application as engineering , biology , physics , meteorology , etc . in particular , and due to their dynamical properties ,",
    "the analysis and prediction of chaotic time series have been of interest for the science community . in general , the chaotic time series are usually modeled by delay - differential equations ; standard examples are the mackey ",
    "glass system @xcite , or the ikeda equation @xcite ( for more examples see @xcite ) .",
    "also , many methods have been used in the chaotic time series analysis @xcite . however , in the last decades different types of artificial neural networks ( ann ) have been widely used for forecasting of chaotic time series , for example , back - propagation algorithm @xcite , radial basic function @xcite , recurrent network @xcite , etc . on the other hand , the analysis of real - life time series requires of taking into account the error propagation of input uncertainties .",
    "the observed data could be contaminated for different instrumental noise types as white noise or proportional to signal ( the latter mainly arises from instrumental calibration ) . in modeling of chaotic time series",
    ", the impact of noise can be treated as errors - invariable problem where the noise is propagated into the prediction model . in the literature ,",
    "the noisy impact on chaotic time series prediction has been barely considered .",
    "we can found studies where the algorithms were tested from a theoretical point of view ( for example , see @xcite ) , and works where the implementation was applied on real - life time series ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , some authors have proposed a modification to the standard methods in order to improve the performance prediction in presence of noise @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we used the mackey  glass chaotic time series in order to study the short - term prediction ( @xmath0 ) with an artificial neural network optimized with a particle swarm algorithm ( ann+pso ) .",
    "the method was applied on noiseless and noisy chaotic time series . in order to carry out the error propagation of the input noise ,",
    "this hybrid algorithm was complemented with a gaussian stochastic procedure to compute a new estimator of the predictions and their uncertainties .",
    "note that anns have been used in combination with pso in several applications .",
    "principally , these applications include : feedforward neural network training @xcite , design of recurrent neural networks @xcite , design of radial basis function networks @xcite , and neural network control for nonlinear processes @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are several current versions of pso available in the literature ( for example , see the following reviews @xcite ) , but our application uses a standard pso with inertial weight @xcite . in this point",
    ", the use of a pso with inertial weight is based on the following reasons : 1 ) this vesion of pso is easy to understand and implement due to its simple concept and learning strategy ; 2 ) as pointed out in @xcite , the pso with inertia weight @xcite and pso with constriction factor @xcite are mathematically equivalent , and pso with constriction factor can be considered as a special case of pso with inertia weight @xcite ( note that this equivalence can be applied to other improved pso algorithms that include a varying the inertia weight schedule ) ; 3 ) inertia weight pso algorithm is quite stable to population changes @xcite ; 4 ) the advantages and disadvantages of variants of pso depend on the problem to solve @xcite ; 5 ) as a first approach for study of noise effect on dynamical systems using an ann combined with inertia weight pso algorithm , so the present study may motivate and help the researchers working in the field of evolutionary algorithms to develop new hybrid models or to apply other existing pso models to solve this problem . to the best of the authors s knowledge",
    ", there is no application for forecasting of noisy chaotic time series such as the one presented here , using a hybrid method that combined ann with pso algorithm",
    ".    organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : ann+pso ]",
    "we present a detailed description of the hybrid ann+pso method .",
    "section  [ sec : noiseless ] and section  4 present the simulation , algorithm implementation and the principal results obtained for the forecasting of noiseless chaotic time series and noisy time series , respectively .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section  5 .",
    "artificial neural networks ( ann ) are similar to biological neural networks in performing functions collectively and in parallel using connection nodes .",
    "thus , ann are a family of statistical learning algorithms biologically inspired . in this study",
    ", we consider one of the most successful and frequently used types of neural networks : a multilayer feed - forward neural network with a backpropagation learning algorithm ( gradient descent error ) .",
    "this ann was implemented replacing standard backpropagation with particle swarm optimization ( pso ) .",
    "pso is a population - based optimization tool , where the system is initialized with a population of random particles and the algorithm searches for optima by updating generations @xcite . in each iteration",
    ", the velocity of each particle @xmath2 is calculated according to the following formula @xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote a particle position and its corresponding velocity in a search space , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is the current step number , @xmath7 is the inertia weight , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the acceleration constants , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are elements from two random sequences in the range ( 0,1 ) .",
    "@xmath12 is the current position of the particle , @xmath13 is the best one of the solutions that this particle has reached , and @xmath14 is the best solutions that all the particles have reached . in general",
    ", the value of each component in @xmath5 can be clamped to the range [ @xmath15 , @xmath16 control excessive roaming of particles outside the search space @xcite . after calculating the velocity ,",
    "the new position of each particle is :    @xmath17    the procedure to calculating the output values , using the input values are described in detail in @xcite .    the net inputs ( @xmath18 )",
    "are calculated for the hidden neurons coming from the inputs neurons . in the case of a neuron in the hidden layer",
    "is has :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the vector of the inputs of the training , @xmath21 is the weight of the connection among the input neurons with the hidden layer @xmath22 , and the term @xmath23 corresponds to the bias of the neuron of the hidden layer @xmath22 , reached in its activation .",
    "the pso algorithm is very different then any of the traditional methods of training @xcite .",
    "each neuron contains a position and velocity .",
    "the position corresponds to the weight of a neuron @xmath24 .",
    "the velocity is used to update the weight @xmath25 .",
    "starting from these inputs , the outputs ( @xmath26 ) of the hidden neurons are calculated , using a transfer function @xmath27 associated with the neurons of this layer : @xmath28    the transfer functions @xmath27 can be linear or non - linear .",
    "we used one hidden layer with @xmath29 as a tangent hyperbolic function ( _ tansing _ ) and @xmath30 as a linear function in the output layer .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ tab : rmse_results ]    _ the prediction performance . _ as illustration , the predictions obtained for noisy case @xmath32 , from the _ standard _",
    "ann+pso ( @xmath33 ) and the _ stochastic _ ann+pso ( @xmath34 ) procedures , are presented in figure  [ fig : mg_output_0.1_prediction ] .",
    "as expected , even on this high noise level case , the @xmath26 and @xmath35 predictions are in total agreement .",
    "actually , the rmse obtained from both methods is same ( in the approximation of the third decimal ) for each noisy case .",
    "for this reason , the rmse shown in table  4 represent the rmse of both methods .    on the other hand , and",
    "as expected , the rmse increases as growing the noise level ( see figure  [ fig : mg_output_rmse_vs_sigma ] ) .",
    "for example , we obtained rmse of 0.0138 and 0.13 for the noiseless and noisy ( with @xmath1=0.1 ) cases , respectively . from figure",
    "[ fig : mg_output_rmse_vs_sigma ] , we observe a linear correlation between the rmse and the input noise level . the best fit model , without considering the rmse of the noiseless case , corresponds to rmse@xmath36 , which shows a strong lineal correlation .",
    "therefore , we confirm that a higher noise level in input data leads to a poor estimation of the prediction estimator , which is related linearly with the input noise level .    also , the ratio @xmath37rmse@xmath38/rmse@xmath39 ( third column in table  [ tab : rmse_results ] ) can be used to study the impact of noise on the performance efficiency of our implementation ( with respect to nominal case ) .",
    "the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : mg_output_rmse_vs_sigma ] shows the performance efficiency against the input noise level . in the worst case , the performance efficiency ( @xmath40 ) is strongly affected by one order of magnitude with respect to noiseless case .",
    "even so , the _ standard _ and _ stochastic _ ann+pso confirm to be a powerful tools for making predictions of chaotic time series .",
    "in the literature , we do not find a similar implementation ( due to the ahead prediction , type and level of noise , etc . )",
    "that allows us a straightforward comparison of results .",
    "for example , we can contrast our results with those presented by sheng et al .",
    "2012 @xcite .",
    "they applied the echo state network based on dual estimation ( esn ) on a noisy mackey ",
    "glass time series ( with a sampling of 2 second ) with a white noise level of @xmath41 .",
    "however , the ahead prediction was one , which is considerable lower than ours . yet",
    "let us carry out a plain comparison .",
    "depend on the prediction performance , they obtained rmse of 0.05 for generic esn ( hereafter gesn ) and 0.04 for ckf / kf based esn ( henceforth cesn ) . in this context , the impact of the noise on the performance efficiency is lower in ann+pso implementation ( with respect to the esn ) .",
    "in fact , we have a performance efficiency @xmath40 of 9.4 while they obtained @xmath40 of 1161 and 33.5 for gesn and cesn , respectively",
    ".    _ prediction uncertainties .",
    "_ one of a main goals of this work is to estimate the uncertainty on the prediction .",
    "the prediction measurement ( @xmath34 ) and the error bars ( @xmath42 ) obtained from the _ stochastic _",
    "ann+pso , for the noisy time series with @xmath32 , are presented in figure  [ fig : mg_output_0.1 ] .",
    "we confirm that our forecast and the input data , for the strong noise contribution , are in agreement at one - sigma ( at 68.5% of confidential level ) when the error bars are considered .",
    "the uncertainties obtained are presented in the low panel of figure  [ fig : mg_output_0.1 ] .",
    "we found a maximum and minimum uncertainty of 0.024 and 0.13 , respectively , with a average of @xmath43 . this value is lower than the input noise level ( @xmath44 ) , and this show impact of the error propagation in our methods .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : mg_output_0.1 ] , a relationship between the uncertainties and the times is not appreciated .",
    "finally , and from figures  [ fig : mg_output_0.1_prediction ]  and  [ fig : mg_output_0.1 ] , we have proven that the ann+pso ( with the _ standard _ and/or the _ stochastic _ implementation ) is a robust tool in the predictability ( for the short - term prediction ) of time series affected by a white noise .",
    "in addition , now the ann+pso method can provide , for first time , an estimation of the uncertainty of the prediction .",
    "in this paper , a hybrid algorithm based on artificial neural network and particle swarm optimization ( ann+pso ) is used in the short - term @xmath0 prediction of mackey  glass chaotic time series .",
    "in addition , an study of the impact of the noise on our hybrid method is presented .",
    "based on the results and discussion presented in this study , we have the following conclusions :    @xmath45 the current value @xmath46 and the past values used have influential effects on the good training and predicting capabilities of the chosen network .",
    "@xmath45 in noiseless case , simulation shows that this hybrid ann+pso algorithm is a very powerful tool for making prediction of chaotic time series , and the low deviations found with the proposed method show an accuracy comparable with other methods available in the literature .",
    "@xmath45 in noisy cases , we have proven that the hybrid ann+pso is a robust tool in the predictability of the short - term prediction of chaotic time series affected by a white noise .",
    "@xmath45 the impact of the noise on the topology and performance efficient of the ann+pso is important .",
    "however , this study shows that the error propagation through the ann+pso have a linear behaviour , which generates a linear relationship between the rmse ( optimization parameter ) and the input noise level .",
    "therefore , the pso optimization provides a linearity which ensures that the neural network will converge to an appropriate solution , even if a noise level contribution is present .",
    "@xmath45 for noisy cases , although a straightforward comparison with literature is unavailable .",
    "the performance efficient @xmath40 proves that the _ standard_/_stochastic _",
    "ann+pso implementation is affected in a lesser degree than other similar performance .",
