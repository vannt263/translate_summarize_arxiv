    "in recent years , the ads / cft correspondence @xcite has been applied to study strongly coupled phenomena in condensed matter physics at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "in particular , inspired by the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the presence of horizon @xcite , holographic superconductors hartnoll , horowitz and superfluids @xcite are two remarkable examples where the gauge / gravity duality plays an important role .",
    "on the other hand , the hydrodynamic limit of ads / cft correspondence has also attracted much attention recently .",
    "computations of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density for a big class of gauge field theories with gravitational duals yields the same number @xmath3 which is not far away from that observed in the strong interacting quark - gluon plasma created in rhic @xcite .",
    "later it has been shown that by using the boundary derivative expansion , one can consistently solve the einstein equation order by order and compute various hydrodynamics transport coefficients of the boundary fluid @xcite .",
    "recently , a holographic model for the parity violating hall viscosity was proposed . like the other transport coefficients",
    ", hall viscosity is also found to be uniquely determined by the near horizon data of the bulk black brane saremi:2011ab .",
    "this is yet another example of the membrane paradigm . in the original construction",
    "the @xmath4 dimensional bulk action has a negative cosmological constant , a real scalar field coupled to the gravitational chern - simons term was studied in the holographic superconductortallarita:2010vu , tallarita:2010uh .",
    "the spectrum of quasinormal modes was studied in the dynamic chern - simons gravity and correction to some hydrodynamic quantities was discussed@xcite . ] .    while it has been shown",
    "that a non - trivial profile of the bulk scalar field is important to obtain a nonvanishing hall viscosity of the @xmath5 dimensional boundary field theory , from the holography point of view it would be interesting to further investigate what role this bulk scalar plays at the boundary .",
    "one possible interpretation is to identify the boundary value of this scalar as an order parameter field which condensates at low temperature in the boundary field theory . from the condensed matter point of view",
    "the physical realization of this order parameter , which leads a system to the spontaneously parity breaking phase is not clear .",
    "but interestingly in terms of physical quantity such as hall viscosity one might get information about how the system breaks parity spontaneously .",
    "so , effectively in the hydrodynamic regime , hall viscosity can play the role of order parameter which is non - zero only below a critical temperature . to be ready for such a boundary theory interpretation",
    ", one shall look for a sourceless boundary condition for the hairy scalar * *  * * if parity is only broken spontaneously .",
    "however , it has been shown that a neutral scalar hair with quadratic and quartic potential that satisfies the usual sourceless boundary condition in a schwarzschild - ads black hole spacetime does not satisfy the positive energy theorem @xcite .",
    "this essentially means that a schwarzschild - ads black hole with a sourceless neutral scalar hair is intrinsically unstable .",
    "while it is still possible to find a sourced solution which minimizes the free energy , we will take a different approach to modification of the model by including a gauge field in the bulk .",
    "the scalar in the original theory is identified as a pseudo scalar now , so its coupling to the gravitational chern - simons term does not break parity . the pseudo scalar hair , however , breaks parity spontaneously and gives a pseudo scalar condensate in the boundary field theory which , as we will demonstrate in the next section , is important for hall viscosity . in the probed limit",
    ", this pseudo scalar hair solution in the charged black brane background is known to be stable iqbal:2010eh .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section two , we present a general discussion of the parity violating viscosities and set up the holographic model . we then compute the hall viscosity and commend on the boundary field theory in section three .",
    "we then conclude our results in section four .",
    "a detailed derivation of hall viscosity together with an analytical approximation are given in the appendix .",
    "it is instructive to classify viscosities by considering the general relation between the energy momentum tensor and the spatial derivative of the fluid velocity@xmath6},\\]]where @xmath7 , @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 are spatial indices and @xmath11 and @xmath12}=\\left ( \\partial _ { k}v_{l}-\\partial _ { l}v_{k}\\right ) $ ] are just the symmetric and anti - symmetric combinations of the derivatives , respectively .",

    "the curl structure naturally reminds us vortices .",
    "it is interesting that the bulk and curl viscosities are associated with the divergence and the curl of the velocity .",
    "both of them can only exist in systems without scaling invariance due to its trace like structure in the energy momentum tensor .",

    "following the discussion of the previous section , we will consider a four dimensional bulk action as the holographic dual to a three dimensional boundary theory .",
    "it is given by a four dimensional einstein action with a negative cosmological constant ; the matter sector includes an abelian yang - mills @xmath38 and a pseudo scalar field @xmath0 : @xmath39the the bulk action conserves parity , so @xmath0 is a pseudo scalar from the last term on the lagrangian which is important to introduce parity violation to the boundary theory through the @xmath0 condensate .",
    "the @xmath40 term is the only difference between our model and saremi and  son s . in our model",
    "a charged black hole solution is allowed .",
    "we will recover their result by taking the black hole charge to zero .    in this paper",
    ", we will only focus on * *  * * the following form of the potential , @xmath41as discussed in @xcite , the second term is necessary to have consistent solution at @xmath42 .",
    "we will study the probed limit of the scalar field by sending @xmath43 and @xmath44 for small @xmath45 .",
    "thus , at leading order in @xmath45 , we only need to solve for the equation of motion governed by the upper line of ( [ action ] ) .",
    "then the background is exactly a charged black brane in @xmath46 spacetime and the hall viscosity @xmath47 can be recovered at the @xmath48 order , since @xmath49 in this probe limit .",
    "the charged black brane solution is given by the metric : @xmath50where @xmath51and the abelian gauge field component of gauge potential can be gauged away with no contribution to the equation of motion .",

    "likewise , in the latter case , when @xmath0 is a constant , the @xmath90 term is just a surface term in the action which has no effect to the bulk equations of motion .",
