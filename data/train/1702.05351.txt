    "the mathematical study of enzyme kinetics ( or michaelis - menten kinetics ) is mainly based on the standard quasi - steady state approximation ( sqssa ) - which has been used in biochemistry , since the pioneering papers by bodenstein @xcite and chapman and underhill @xcite - which starts from the observation that enzyme reactions are characterized by a first , short transient phase , where the intermediate complex rapidly grows , and a second , longer quasi - equilibrium phase , where the complex slowly decays in the product , in general the activated substrate .",
    "each phase of the reaction has a time scale ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) .",
    "the quasi - steady state approximation is a very efficient way of simplification for the description of a typical saturation phenomenon , occurring in enzyme kinetics , but present in several other biological systems .",
    "let us cite , just as non exhaustive examples , the monod - wyman - changeux molecular model of cooperativity in allosteric reactions @xcite , or , more recently , the model of lekszycki and coworkers concerning the bone regeneration @xcite and the model of infarcted cardiac tissue regeneration by means of stem cells @xcite , where saturation phenomena are observed .",
    "the reaction can be described as follows .",
    "let us consider an enzyme , @xmath2 , which reacts with a protein , @xmath3 , resulting in an intermediate complex , @xmath4 .",
    "in turn , this complex can break down into a product , @xmath5 , and the enzyme @xmath2 .",
    "it is frequently assumed that the formation of @xmath4 is reversible while its breakup is not .",
    "the process is represented by the following sequence of reactions @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the reaction rates .    for notational convenience we will use variable names to denote both a chemical species and its concentration . for example",
    ", @xmath2 denotes both an enzyme and its concentration .",
    "reaction ( [ eq : a1 ] ) obeys two natural constrains : the total amounts of protein and enzyme remain constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath8 for positive constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in conjunction with the constraints ( [ eq : a2 ] ) , the following cauchy problem for a system of two ordinary differential equations can be used to model reaction ( [ eq : a1 ] ) : @xmath11 \\notag \\\\ & x(0)=x_t ,    \\quad c(0)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and where @xmath10 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are viewed as fixed positive constants and @xmath17 is the michaelis affinity constant .",
    "similarly , we can define the dissociation constant @xmath18 and the van slyke - cullen constant @xmath19 .",
    "since , after a short transient , where the complex @xmath4 rapidly grows , reaching its maximal concentration , it slowly decays , the sqssa consists in supposing that , after the transient phase , the complex can be considered in a quasi - equilibrium , i.e. , posing @xmath20 . with this approximation ,",
    "the system becomes the differential - algebraic system    @xmath21    ( @xmath22 ) where only the initial condition @xmath23 can be imposed , because the sqssa describes only the slow phase , where the initial value of @xmath24 is its maximal value , instead of @xmath25 .    in the sixties of the last century mathematicians ( see , in particular , @xcite ) interpreted the sqssa in terms of leading order term of asymptotic expansions with respect to a perturbation parameter @xmath26 , which must be supposed small .",
    "heineken et al . used @xmath27 , because in literature it is widely used to impose that the initial concentration of the enzyme @xmath2 is much less than the concentration of the substrate @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter can also arise by virtue of a biochemical condition imposing the separation between the two timescales @xmath0 and @xmath1 characterizing the reaction ( see also @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", segel - slemrod @xcite showed that the sqssa can be obtained also as the leading order of an asymptotic expansion in terms of @xmath28 , enlarging the parameter range of validity of the sqssa .",
    "inspired by the papers by laidler @xcite , swoboda @xcite , and schauer and heinrich @xcite , borghans et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a different approximation , called total quasi - steady state approximation ( tqssa ) which uses the new variable @xmath29 , called total substrate .    formally , introducing the `` lumped '' variable @xmath30 , problem ( [ eq : a3 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath31 , \\notag \\\\ & \\overline{x}(0)=x_t , \\quad c(0)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    also the tqssa posits that @xmath4 equilibrates quickly compared to @xmath32 .    imposing also in this case a quasi - steady state approximation ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the only biologically allowed solution of @xmath35 .",
    "let us remark that since , thanks to the conservations laws , @xmath36 , the tqssa can be viewed as the other side of the coin of laidler s theory , though the approach followed in @xcite implicitly contains much more information about the reliability of the approximation , as shown in @xcite .    also the tqssa can be seen as the leading order term of an asymptotic expansion in terms of a suitable parameter , @xmath37 , producing a new approximation , which is valid in a much wider parameter range .",
    "the parameter , introduced in @xcite , appears already in a paper by palsson @xcite , where the author determines sufficient conditions for the application of any quasi - steady state approximation , based again on the time scale separation .",
    "taking into account that the perturbation parameter is always less than @xmath38 , its introduction in terms of time scale separation appears much more natural than the previous parameters .",
    "this result gives a theoretical mathematical foundation of the choice of the parameter in the tqssa .",
    "moreover , several authors ( see , for example , @xcite ) study the transient phase of the reaction supposing that in this phase @xmath3 does not change substantially .",
    "this hypothesis is not realistic , while , using the total substrate @xmath39 , we observe that at time 0 , we have @xmath40 , which addresses much more naturally the request of small changes of the total substrate in the initial time of the reaction .    in figure [ figura1 ]",
    "we show the different efficiency of the two quasi - steady state approximations , when the parameters are stressed in such a way that the sqssa is no more valid .    ) , with their sqssa ( [ eq : a3bis ] ) and tqssa ( [ eq : tqssa_single ] ) .",
    "the parameter set is the following : @xmath41 .",
    "the inadequacy of the sqssa , mainly in the first part of the reaction , is evident , while the tqssa in indistinguishable from the numerical solution of the system.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] ) , with their sqssa ( [ eq : a3bis ] ) and tqssa ( [ eq : tqssa_single ] ) .",
    "the parameter set is the following : @xmath41 .",
    "the inadequacy of the sqssa , mainly in the first part of the reaction , is evident , while the tqssa in indistinguishable from the numerical solution of the system.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in previous literature the different qssas are approached by means of two different tools : tihonov s theorem @xcite , which studies the asymptotic stability of systems of differential equations characterized by the presence of small perturbative parameters and center manifold theory , which is one of the most powerful tools to study the dimensional reduction of differential systems .",
    "for example , on the one hand , heineken et al .",
    "@xcite and dvok and ika @xcite quote tihonov s theorem in order to justify the sqssa , while khho and hegland @xcite refer to this theorem to apply the tqssa ; on the other hand , other authors @xcite interpret the sqssa and the tqssa , respectively , as the slow manifold of the michaelis - menten kinetics .",
    "however , at the best of our knowledge , the two approaches are not yet compared , in order to check whether there exist any equivalences between the so - called singular points , introduced by tihonov , and the center manifolds , as studied , for example , by carr @xcite .",
    "applying the techniques exposed in @xcite , we show that the two approximations are asymptotically equivalent , concluding that the sqssa and the tqssa can be interpreted both as the singular point of the michaelis - menten kinetics and its center manifold .",
    "this means that tihonov s theorem implies that any qssa can be mathematically interpreted as the study of the reduced system of the original system setting the perturbative parameter @xmath42 , instead of setting the derivative of the complex @xmath24 equal to zero .",
    "this fact formally allows the application of a `` mechanistic '' passage , consisting in equating to zero the derivatives of the complexes , in the single reaction scheme , as in more complex reactions , because this is the simplest way to reach ( an approximate ) expression of the center manifold .",
    "for example , wang and sontag @xcite apply this technique for the study of the sqssa of the double phosphorylation - dephosphorylation cycle .    as shown in @xcite ,",
    "however , these approximation are no more applicable to mechanisms where oscillations can appear and an a priori analysis of the application should be performed every time we have to deal with any qssa .",
    "the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we recall all the main definitions and properties of tihonov s theory and of the center manifold theory ; in section 3 we show the equivalence of the two approaches in the case of the sqssa , of the tqssa and for a class of more general systems of differential equations characterized by the presence of a small , perturbative parameter ; in section 4 we discuss some future applications of this results to more complex enzymatic reactions .",
    "in this section we introduce the notations and summarize the results we need for the formulation of the problem investigated here . for convenience of the reader",
    "we closely follow the notations of the fundamental book by wiggins @xcite .",
    "we will investigate systems in the class of general autonomous vector fields @xmath43    it is natural to consider the linearized system @xmath44 associated to the vector field ( [ eq:1 ] ) , if @xmath45 is one of its fixed points , and the constant jacobian @xmath46 matrix @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 can be represented as the direct sum of three subspaces denoted @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , which are defined as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the ( generalized ) eigenvectors of @xmath56 corresponding to the eigenvalues having negative real part , positive real part and zero real part , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are referred to as the stable , unstable , and center subspaces , respectively .",
    "they are invariant subspaces ( or manifolds ) since solutions of ( [ eq:7 ] ) with initial conditions entirely contained in either @xmath49 , @xmath50 , or @xmath51 must forever remain in that particular subspace for all time .",
    "it is well known that there exists a linear transformation @xmath57 which transforms the linear equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) into block diagonal form @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is an @xmath62 matrix having eigenvalues with negative real part , @xmath63 is an @xmath64 matrix having eigenvalues with positive real part , and @xmath65 is an @xmath66 matrix having eigenvalues with zero real part .",
    "the @xmath25 in the block diagonal form ( [ eq:14 ] ) indicate appropriately sized block consisting of all zero s . using this same linear transformation to transform the coordinates of the nonlinear vector field ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "gives the equation @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are the first @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 components , respectively , of the vector @xmath74 .",
    "the following theorem shows how this structure changes when the nonlinear vector field ( [ eq:13 ] ) is considered .",
    "it is stated without proof ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "[ th:2 ] suppose ( [ eq:13 ] ) is @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "then the fixed point @xmath77 of ( [ eq:13 ] ) possesses a @xmath75 s - dimensional local , invariant stable manifold , @xmath78 , a @xmath75 u - dimensional local , invariant unstable manifold , @xmath79 , and a @xmath75 c - dimensional local , invariant center manifold , @xmath80 , all intersecting in @xmath77 .",
    "these manifolds are all tangent to the respective invariant subspaces of the linear vector field ( [ eq:14 ] ) at the origin and , hence , are locally representable as graphs . in particular , we have @xmath81 @xmath82    @xmath83 @xmath84",
    "@xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are @xmath75 functions .",
    "moreover , trajectories in @xmath78 and @xmath79 have the same asymptotic properties as trajectories in @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "namely , trajectories of ( [ eq:13 ] ) with initial conditions in @xmath78 ( resp . , @xmath79 ) approach the origin at an exponential rate asymptotically as @xmath93 ( resp . , @xmath94 ) .",
    "if the eigenvalues of the center subspace are all precisely zero - rather than having just real part zero - then a center manifold is called a _ slow manifold_.      if @xmath95 , then any orbit will rapidly decay to @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the long - time behavior ( i.e. , stability ) we need only to investigate the system restricted to @xmath51 . this simple reasoning is the foundation of the `` reduction principle '' applied to the study of the stability of nonhyperbolic fixed points of nonlinear vector fields .    for our purposes ,",
    "let us consider vector fields of the following form @xmath96 where @xmath97 in the above , @xmath56 is a @xmath66 matrix having eigenvalues with zero real parts , @xmath98 is an @xmath99 matrix having eigenvalues with negative real parts , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are @xmath75 functions ( @xmath102 ) .    for the sake of notation simplicity ,",
    "let us write the center manifold in the following way : @xmath103 with @xmath104 sufficiently small .",
    "[ r:1 ] we remark that the conditions @xmath105 and @xmath106 imply that @xmath107 is tangent to @xmath51 at @xmath108 .",
    "the following three theorems are taken from the seminal book @xcite , as reported in @xcite .",
    "[ th:3 ] there exists a @xmath75 center manifold for ( [ eq:34 ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of ( [ eq:34 ] ) restricted to the center manifold is , for @xmath72 sufficiently small , given by the following c - dimensional vector field @xmath109    the next result implies that the dynamics of ( [ eq:35 ] ) near @xmath110 determines the dynamics of ( [ eq:34 ] ) near @xmath108 .",
    "[ th:4 ] i ) let the zero solution of ( [ eq:35 ] ) be stable ( asymptotically stable ) ( unstable ) ; then the zero solution of ( [ eq:34 ] ) is also stable ( asymptotically stable ) ( unstable ) .",
    "ii ) let the zero solution of ( [ eq:35 ] ) be stable .",
    "then if @xmath111 is a solution of ( [ eq:34 ] ) with @xmath112 sufficiently small , there is a solution @xmath113 of ( [ eq:35 ] ) such that as @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a constant .",
    "it is possible to compute the center manifold so that we can reap the benefits of theorem [ th:4 ] . using invariance of @xmath107 under the dynamics of ( [ eq:34 ] )",
    ", we derive a quasi - linear partial differential equation that @xmath117 must satisfy , in order for its graph to be a center manifold for ( [ eq:34 ] ) .",
    "this is done as follows :    1 .",
    "the @xmath118 coordinates of any point on @xmath107 must satisfy @xmath119 2 .   differentiating ( [ eq:36 ] ) with respect to time",
    "implies that the @xmath120 coordinates of any point on @xmath107 must satisfy @xmath121 3 .",
    "any point on @xmath107 obeys the dynamics generated by ( [ eq:34 ] ) .",
    "therefore , substituting @xmath122 into ( [ eq:37 ] ) gives @xmath123 or @xmath124    then , to find a center manifold , all we need to do is to solve ( [ eq:40 ] ) .",
    "[ th:5 ] let @xmath125 be a @xmath126 mapping with @xmath127 such that @xmath128 as @xmath129 for some @xmath130 .",
    "then @xmath131    the theorem gives us a method for computing an approximate solution of ( [ eq:40 ] ) to any desired degree of accuracy .",
    "so , for this task , we will employ power series expansions ( note that by remark [ r:1 ] power series expansions start from second order ) .",
    "suppose now that ( [ eq:34 ] ) depends on a vector of parameters @xmath132 : @xmath133 where @xmath134 with the same assumptions as in ( [ eq:34 ] ) .    following wiggins @xcite , we will handle parameterized systems including the parameter @xmath26 as a new dependent variable as follows @xmath135 this system has a fixed point at @xmath136 .",
    "the matrix associated with the linearization of ( [ eq:44 ] ) around this fixed point has @xmath71 eigenvalues with negative real part and @xmath137 eigenvalues with zero real part .",

    ". it can be proven ( see , among others , @xcite as reported in @xcite ) that any couple of center manifolds of a given fixed point differ by ( at most ) exponentially small terms .",
    "thus , the taylor series expansions of any two center manifolds agree to all orders .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that , due to the attractive nature of the center manifold , certain orbits ( for example , fixed points , periodic orbits , homoclinic orbits , and heteroclinic orbits ) that remain close to the origin for all the time must be on every center manifold of a given fixed point .",
    "for this subsection we will refer to the widespread book by w. wasow @xcite , and - in particular - to its relevant section on singular perturbations .",
    "a systematic study of the qualitative aspects of such singular perturbation problems can be found in a series of papers by tihonov ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "<S> in this paper we prove that the well - known quasi - steady state approximations , commonly used in enzyme kinetics , which can be interpreted as the reduced system of a differential system depending on a perturbative parameter , according to tihonov theory , are asymptotically equivalent to the center manifold of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to give a mathematical foundation for the application of a mechanistic method to determine the center manifold of ( at this moment , still simple ) enzyme reactions . </S>"
