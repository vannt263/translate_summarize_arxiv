    "in the last decade nanostructured optical elements based on scattering of light waves by subwavelength - size metal objects , such as particles and screen holes , have been investigated intensively .",
    "the most impressive features of the optical elements are resonant enhancement and spatial localization of optical fields by the excitation of electron waves in the metal ( for example , see the studies  @xcite ) .",
    "recently some nanostructures , namely a single subwavelength slit , a grating with subwavevelength slits , and a subwavelength slit surrounded by parallel deep and narrow grooves attracted a particular attention of researchers .",
    "the study of resonant enhanced transmission and collimation of waves in close proximity to a single subwavelength slit acting as a microscope probe @xcite was connected with developing near - field scanning microwave and optical microscopes with subwavelength resolution @xcite .",
    "the resonant transmission of light by a grating with subwavelength slits or a subwavelength slit surrounded by grooves is an important effect for nanophotonics @xcite .",
    "the transmissivity , on the resonance , can be orders of magnitude greater than out of the resonance .",
    "it was understood that the enhancement effect has a two - fold origin : first , the field increases due to a pure geometrical reason , the coupling of incident plane waves with waveguide mode resonances located in the slit , and further enhancement arises due to excitation of coupled surface plasmon polaritons localized on both surfaces of the slit ( grating ) @xcite .",
    "a dominant mechanism responsible for the extraordinary transmission is the resonant excitation of the waveguide mode in the slit giving a fabry - perot like behaviour @xcite .",
    "in addition to the extraordinary transmission , a series of parallel grooves surrounding a nanometer - size slit can produce a micrometer - size beam that spreads to an angle of only few degrees @xcite .",
    "the light collimation , in this case , is achieved by the excitation of coupled surface plasmon polaritons in the grooves @xcite . at appropriate conditions , a single subwavelength slit flanked by a finite array of grooves can act as a `` lens '' focusing light @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the diffractive spreading of a beam can be reduced also by using a structured aperture or an effective nanolens formed by self - similar linear chain of metal nanospheres @xcite .",
    "new aspects of the problem of resonantly enhanced transmission and collimation of light are revealed when the nanostructures are illuminated by an ultra - short ( femtosecond ) light pulse @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the study  @xcite , the unique possibility of concentrating the energy of an ultrafast excitation of an `` engineered '' or a random nanosystem in a small part of the whole system by means of phase modulation of the exciting fs - pulse was predicted .",
    "the study  @xcite theoretically demonstrated the feasibility of nm - scale localization and distortion - free transmission of fs visible pulses by a single metal slit , and further suggested the feasibility of simultaneous super resolution in space and time of the near - field scanning optical microscopy ( nsom ) .",
    "the quasi - diffraction - free optics based on transmission of pulses by a subwavelength nano - slit has been suggested to extend the operation principle of a 2d nsom to the `` not - too - distant '' field regime ( up to @xmath0  0.5 wavelength ) @xcite .",
    "some interesting effects , namely the pulse delay and long living resonant excitations of electromagnetic fields in the resonant - transition gratings were recently described in the studies @xcite .",
    "the great interest to resonant enhanced transmission , spatial localization ( collimation ) of continuous waves and light pulses by subwavelength metal slits leads to the basic question : can a light pulse be enhanced and simultaneously localized in space and time by a subwavelength slit ? if the field enhancement can be achieved together with nm - scale spatial and fs - scale temporal localizations , this could greatly increase the potentials of the nanoslit systems in high - resolution applications , especially in near - field scanning microscopy and spectroscopy . in the present article we test whether the resonant enhancement could only be obtained at the expense of the spatial and temporal broadening of a light wavepacket . to address this question ,",
    "the spatial distribution of the energy flux of an ultrashort ( fs ) pulse diffracted by a subwavelength ( nanosized ) slit in a thick metal film of perfect conductivity will be analyzed by using the conventional approach based on the neerhoff and mur solution of maxwell s equations . in short",
    ", we first will summarize the theoretical development of neerhoff and mur ( section ii ) and the model will then be used to calculate the spatial distribution of the energy flux of the transmitted pulse ( wavepacket ) under various regimes of the near - field diffraction ( section  iii ) .",
    "we will show that a light pulse can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the near - field diffraction zone at the nm- and fs - scales .",

    "iv we summarize the results and present the conclusions .",
    "an adequate description of the transmission of light through a subwavelength nano - sized slit in a thick metal film requires solution of maxwell s equations with complicated boundary conditions .",
    "the light - slit interaction problem even for a continuous wave can be solved only by extended two - dimensional @xmath1 numerical computations .",

    "the shifts of the resonance wavelengths from the fabry - perot resonances are caused by the wavelength dependent terms in the denominator of eq .",
    "[ annefi ] .",
    "it should be noted that the values of the shifts calculated using eq .",
    "[ annefi ] are in good agreement with the shifts calculated using the analytical formula ( 8) of the study  @xcite .",
    "our computations showed that the peak heights at the main ( strongest ) resonant wavelength @xmath96 ( in the case of fig .",

    "analysis of fig .",
    "[ tlamdia ] indicates that a minimum thickness of the screen is required to get the waveguide resonance inside the slit at a given wavelength .",
    "the result is in agreement with the study  @xcite , which demonstrated that there is no transmission peaks at the condition @xmath103 .",
    "notice that the transmission enhancement mediated by surface plasmons does exist at considerably smaller thicknesses of the metal in comparison with the thickness required for the waveguide resonance .",
    "the surface plasmons / polaritons are excited in the skin , the depth of which is about the extinction length of the energy decay of electromagnetic wave in the metal .",
    "for instance , the extinction length in an aluminum screen is @xmath0  4  nm for @xmath75  =  800  nm .",
    "therefore , for not too narrow slits ( 2@xmath104  =  25  nm ) in thick screens ( @xmath5  =  200 and 350  nm ) considered in the paper , the finite skin depth does not fundamentally modify the process of the extraordinary optical transmission . at the wavelength 800  nm ,",
    "the 10-times enhancement ( @xmath105  @xmath106  @xmath107  @xmath106  10 ) is limited by the slit width ( @xmath4  =  25  nm ) . in the far - infrared region ( @xmath75  @xmath106  100  @xmath108 m )",
    "several orders of magnitude enhancement can be achieved at the same experimental conditions .",
    "it should be noted that the optimal choice of parameters has been discussed in the literature and the obtained enhancement by the factors 10 and 1000 are typical for continuous waves in the optical and far - infrared spectral ranges . in the case of narrower and thinner slits , however , the influence of the finite conductivity effects on the transmission and localization of a pulse should be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the existence of transmission resonances for fourier @xmath3-components of a wave - packet leads to the question : what effect the resonant enhancement has on the spatial and temporal localization of a light pulse ? presumably , the high transmission at resonance occurs when the system efficiently channels fourier - components of the wave - packet from a wide area through the slit . at resonance",
    ", one might assume that if the energy flow is symmetric about the screen , the pulse width and duration should increase very rapidly past the screen .",
    "thus the large pulse strength associated with resonance could only be obtained at the expense of the spatial and temporal broadening of the wave - packet . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "the spatial distributions of the energy flux of a transmitted wave - packet were computed for different slit thicknesses corresponding to the resonance and anti - resonance position . the characteristic difference between the resonant and non - resonant transmissions",
    "could be understood better through a single figure of the field distributions in all regions i , ii and iii .",
    "however , it seems to be impossible to do this , because the visualization of a pulse by a single figure requires a 4-dimensional ( u , x , z , t ) coordinate system or a great number of 3-dimensional figures at different locations and suitable fixed times in all the regions .",
    "therefore we present the eight 3-dimensional distributions ( [ ap2tav](a)-(d ) and [ atav](a)-(d ) ) only in the zone of main interest ( region iii ) . as an example ,",
    "[ ap2tav ]  ( a ) and [ atav ]  ( a ) show the energy flux of the anti - resonantly transmitted pulses .",
    "figures  [ ap2tav ]  ( b ) and [ atav ]  ( b ) correspond to the case of the waveguide - mode resonance in the slit .",
    "figures  [ ap2tav ] and [ atav ] show the transmitted pulses at the distances @xmath109  =  @xmath110 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the rigorous analysis @xcite showed that the number of modes required for the accurate computation of the transmittance , near - field distribution , and other optical characteristics of the system is given by @xmath111 , where n is the number of the waveguide modes and z is the distance from the screen .",
    "therefore at the distances @xmath109  =  @xmath110 and @xmath104 the calculations required at least 4 and 2 modes , respectively .",
    "the shape and intensity of an output pulse depends on the slit parameters and the spectral width of the pulse . for narrow slits ,",
    "the spectral width of a 100-fs input pulse is smaller compared to the spectral width of the resonant transmission ( see , fig .",
    "[ tlamdia ] ) . the comparison of the flux distribution presented in fig .  [ ap2tav ]  ( a ) with that of fig .",
    "[ ap2tav ]  ( b ) shows that , for the parameter values adopted , a transmitted wavepacket is enhanced by one order of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the 25-nm and 100-fs domains of the near - field diffraction zone .",
    "the shapes of the intensity distributions of the output pulses are very much the same off and on resonance .",
    "the figures differ only in the order of magnitude of @xmath73 .",
    "thus at the distance @xmath109  =  @xmath110 , the slit resonantly enhances the intensity of the pulse without its spatial and temporal broadening .",
    "the result can be easily understood by considering the dispersion properties of the slit .",
    "for the screen thickness @xmath5  =  200 nm , the amplitudes of the fourier - components of the wave - packet , whose central wavelength @xmath112 is detuned from the main ( at 500  nm ) resonance , are practically unchanged in the wavelength region near 800  nm ( see , curve  b in fig .",
    "[ tlamdia ] ) .",
    "this provides the dispersion- and distortion - free non - resonant transmission of the wave - packet ( figs .",
    "[ ap2tav](a ) and [ atav](a ) ) . in the case of the thicker screen ( b  =  350 nm ) ,",
    "the slit transmission experiences strong mode - coupling regime at the wavelengths near to 800  nm ( see curve a of fig .  [ tlamdia ] ) that leads to a profound and uniform enhancement of amplitudes of all of the fourier @xmath3-components of the wave - packet ( see curve c in fig .  [ tlamdia ] ) .",
    "thus , the slit resonantly enhances by one order of magnitude the intensity of the pulse without its spatial and temporal broadenings ( figs .",
    "[ ap2tav](b ) and [ atav](b ) ) .",
    "also , notice that at the distance @xmath109  =  @xmath104 ( figs .",
    "[ atav](a ) and [ atav](b ) ) , both the resonantly and anti - resonantly transmitted pulses experience natural spatial broadening in the transverse direction , while their durations are practically unchanged . the spectral width of a 5-fs input pulse , however , is bigger than the spectral width of the resonant transmission ( fig . [ tlamdia ] ) . in this case",
    "the durations of the resonantly transmitted 5-fs pulses are longer in comparison with the pulses transmitted off the resonance ( figs .",
    "[ ap2tav](c ) , ( d ) and respectively [ atav](c ) , ( d ) ) .",
    "we also notice that the enhancement of the intensity of 5-fs pulses is approximately two times lower in comparison with the 100-fs pulses .",
    "the temporal broadening of the pulse and the decrease of the enhancement indicates a natural limitation for the simultaneous temporal and spatial localization of a pulse together with its enhancement .    by comparing the data for anti - resonant and resonant transmissions presented in figs .",
    "[ ap2tav ] and [ atav ] one can see that at the appropriate values of the distance @xmath109 and the wave - packet spectral width @xmath113 the resonance effect does not influence the spatial and temporal localization of the wave - packet .",
    "to verify this somewhat unexpected result , the fwhms of the transmitted pulse in the transverse and longitudinal directions were calculated for different values of the slit width @xmath4 , central wavelength @xmath112 and pulse duration @xmath114 as a function of screen thickness @xmath5 at two particular near - field distances @xmath109  =  @xmath110 and @xmath104 from the screen .",
    "it was seen that , at the dispersion - free resonant transmission condition @xmath115 , the transmitted pulse indeed does not experience temporal broadening .",
    "thus the temporal localization associated with the duration @xmath61 of the incident pulse remains practically unchanged under the transmission .",
    "the value of @xmath61 is determined by the dispersion - free condition @xmath116 , where @xmath117 practically does not depend on the screen thickness @xmath5 .",
    "we found that the energy flux of the transmitted wave - packet can be enhanced by a factor @xmath97 by the appropriate adjusting of the screen thickness @xmath118 , for an example see figs .",
    "[ tlamdia]-[atav ] .",
    "thus the wave - packet can be enhanced by a factor @xmath119 and simultaneously localized in the time domain at the @xmath120 scale .",
    "it was also seen that the fwhm of the transmitted pulse in the transverse direction depends on the wave - packet central wavelength @xmath112 and the distance @xmath121 from the slit .",
    "nevertheless , the fwhm of the transmitted pulse can be always reduced to the value @xmath4 by the appropriate decreasing of the distance @xmath109  =  @xmath122 from the screen ( @xmath109  =  @xmath110 , in the case of fig .",
    "[ ap2tav ] ) .",
    "thus high transmission can be achieved without concurrent loss in the degree of temporal and spatial localizations of the pulse .",
    "in retrospect , this result is reasonable , since the symmetry of the problem for a time - harmonic continuous wave ( fourier @xmath3-component of a wave - packet ) is disrupted by the presence of the initial and reflected fields in addition to the diffracted field on one side ( eq .  [ u1ossz ] ) . as the thickness changes , the fields @xmath22 and @xmath123 change only in magnitude , but the field @xmath124 changes in distribution as well since it involves the sum of @xmath22 with unchanging fields @xmath18 and @xmath20 . at resonance ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath124 leads to channeling of the radiation , but the distribution of @xmath123 remains unaffected . by the appropriate adjusting of the slit - pulse parameters",
    "a light pulse can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the near - field diffraction zone at the nm- and fs - scales .",
    "the limitations of the above analysis must be considered before the results are used for a particular experimental device .",
    "the resonant enhancement with simultaneous nm - scale spatial and fs - scale temporal localizations of a light by a subwavelength metal nano - slit is a consequence of the assumption of the screen perfect conductivity .",
    "the slit can be made of perfectly conductive ( at low temperatures ) materials . in the context of current technology , however , the use of conventional materials like metal films at a room temperature is more practical .",
    "notice that a metal can be considered as a perfect conductor in the microwave range . as a general criterion ,",
    "the perfect conductivity assumption should remain valid as far as the slit width and the screen thickness exceed the extinction length for the fourier @xmath3-components of a wavepacket within the metal .",
    "the light intensity decays in the metal screen at the rate of @xmath125 , where @xmath126  =  @xmath127 is the extinction length in the screen .",
    "the aluminum has the largest opacity ( @xmath128  11  nm ) in the spectral region @xmath129  100  nm [ 20 ] .",
    "the extinction length increases from 11 to  220  nm with decreasing the wavelength from 100  to  50  nm . hence",
    ", the perfect conductivity is a very good approximation in a situation involving a relatively thick ( @xmath130  25  nm ) aluminum screen and a wave - packet of the duration @xmath114 having the fourier components in the spectral region @xmath129  100  nm .",
    "however , in the case of thinner screens , shorter pulses and smaller central wavelengths of wave - packets , the metal films are not completely opaque .",
    "this would reduce a value of spatial localization of a pulse due to passage of the light through the screen in the region away from the slit .",
    "moreover , the phase shifts of the fourier components along the propagation path caused by the skin effect can modify the enhancement coefficient and temporal localization properties of the slit .",
    "the above analysis is directly applicable to the two - dimensional near - field scanning optical microscopy and spectroscopy .",
    "although the computations were performed in the case of normal incidence , the preliminary analysis shows that in the case of oblique incidence the enhancement effect can be kept without further spatial and temporal broadening of the pulse . in a conventional 2d nsom",
    ", a subwavelength ( @xmath131 ) slit illuminated by a continuous wave is used as a near - field ( @xmath132 ) light source providing the nm - scale resolution in space @xcite .",
    "the non - resonant transmission of fs pulses could provide ultrahigh resolution of 2d nsom simultaneously in space and time @xcite .",
    "the above - described resonantly enhanced transmission together with nm- and fs - scale localizations in the space and time of a pulse could greatly increase the potentials of the 2d near - field scanning optical microscopy and spectroscopy , especially in high - resolution applications .",
    "however , as a model for a nsom - tip a hole ( quadratic , rectangular or circular ) would be more appropriate than a slit - type waveguide .",
    "the consequences of the limitation of region ii also in y - direction will result in faster attenuation of the amplitude of the waveguide modes compared to the slit - type waveguide modes  @xcite .",
    "this should affect the enhancement and spatial and temporal broadening of the pulse .",
    "moreover , the walls of the 2d slit have to be parallel over all the thickness to provide the resonance enhancement effect . pulled nsom 3d - tips , however , usually have conical ends . in the case of the tapered nsom 3d waveguides",
    "one should also take into account the decrease of enhancement effect with increasing the waveguide taper .",
    "it should be also noted that the high transmission ( @xmath97 ) of a pulse can be achieved without concurrent loss in the temporal and spatial localizations of the pulse only at short ( @xmath133 ) distances from the slit .",
    "the presence of a microscopic sample ( a molecule , for example ) placed at the short distance in strong interaction with nsom slit modifies the boundary conditions . in the case of strong slit - sample - pulse interaction , which takes place at the distance @xmath134 , the response function accounting for the modification of the quantum mechanical behaviour of the sample",
    "should be taken into consideration .",
    "the potential applications of the effect of the resonantly enhanced transmission together with nm- and fs - scale localizations of a pulse are not limited to near - field microscopy and spectroscopy . broadly speaking , the effect concerns all physical phenomena and photonic applications involving a transmission of light by a single subwavelength nano - slit , a grating with subwavevelength slits and a subwavelength slit surrounded by parallel grooves ( see the studies  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for instance , the effect could be used for sensors , communications , optical switching devices and microscopes .",
    "in the present article we have considered the question whether a light pulse can be enhanced and simultaneously localized in space and time by a subwavelength metal nano - slit . to address this question ,",
    "the spatial distributions of the energy flux of an ultrashort ( fs ) pulse diffracted by a subwavelength ( nanosized ) slit in a thick metal screen of perfect conductivity have been analyzed by using the conventional approach based on the neerhoff and mur solution of maxwell s equations .",
    "the analysis of the spatial distributions for various regimes of the near - field diffraction demonstrated that the energy flux of a wavepacket can be enhanced by orders of magnitude and simultaneously localized in the near - field diffraction zone at the nm- and fs - scales .",
    "the extraordinary transmission , together with nm- and fs - scale localizations of the light pulse , make the nano - slit structures attractive for many photonic purposes , such as sensors , communication , optical switching devices and nsom .",
    "we also believe that the addressing of the above - mentioned basic question gains insight into the physics of near - field resonant diffraction .",
    "this study was supported by the fifth framework of the european commission ( financial support from the ec for shared - cost rtd actions : research and technological development projects , demonstration projects and combined projects .",
