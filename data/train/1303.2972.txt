    "the wave function and its collapse remain in controversial positions in the general framework of quantum theory .",
    "nevertheless , for long periods in the development of wave mechanics these issues were put aside by most of users of the quantum formalism as , perhaps , an underlying discomfort .",
    "one of the reasons for this is the fact that there were plenty of more direct questions to be coped with regarding , e. g. , atomic and particle physics . in the last few decades",
    ", however , experiments reached a remarkable sophistication and textbook illustrations became feasible in the laboratory .",
    "this allowed for objective discussions on , until then , purely academic matters , as for example in the experimental tests @xcite of bell s inequalities @xcite .    since then , part of the focus started to migrate from operational aspects to more foundational ones .",
    "this ongoing move is so important that , justifiably , has been termed _ the second quantum revolution _ @xcite .",
    "examples of this process are the debate on the  reality \" of quantum states , which received special attention in the last year @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and the many facets of the measurement problem , in particular , the collapse of the state vector @xcite .",
    "these two topics are intimately related since there is no collapse problem in the epistemic view , where a state is regarded as the experimenter s information on some aspects of reality .",
    "particularly , in the statistical interpretation @xcite , where the basic entity is an ensemble ( nothing being said about single particles ) , the decoherence program @xcite alone seems to solve the remaining puzzle , namely , the lack of superposition states in the macroscopic world .",
    "however , if one admits that the quantum state of a single object has a physical reality , the ontic view , then the collapse problem persists .",
    "in such a case it is hard to accept that any kind of instantaneous evolution can happen . in this work",
    "we take this observation earnestly , and argue that if the state vector is of ontological nature , then the collapse should not be instantaneous .    in what follows",
    "we show that it is possible to check this hypothesis experimentally via a large number of synchronized polarization measurements of two correlated photons .",
    "it is worth to mention that finite - time collapse has been considered before in different circumstances , e. g. , in the search for stochastic terms which , added to the shcroedinger equation , produce a reduction dynamics consistent with born s rule @xcite .",
    "in a scenario of non - instantaneous collapse the measurement postulate must be recast in some way .",
    "a recent proposal @xcite that we will adopt here , with some modifications of nomenclature , reads :    \\(i ) _ measurement duration and  hits \" _ : we take into account the fact that any actual measurement has a duration , that we denote by @xmath0 and , most importantly , we assume that the collapse is a process initiated by a random hit ( we borrow this terminology from @xcite in a distinct context ) occurring at @xmath1 , which is taken as a stochastic variable obeying some probability distribution defined in the window @xmath2 $ ] . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the system remains uncoupled to external degrees of freedom .",
    "the exact nature of the distribution and the duration @xmath0 depend on the specific system and measurement method , as will be exemplified later .",
    "\\(ii ) _ finite - time collapse _ : the quantum state takes a short time @xmath4 , starting from @xmath1 , to complete the reduction . we do not make any specific statements about the non - unitary time evolution in the interval @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "but we do assume that during the reduction the state of the system is still contained in a ket belonging to the enlarged hilbert space @xmath6 , where @xmath7 concerns the system of interest and @xmath8 refer to all relevant degrees of freedom that couple with it .    regarding ( i ) we remark that , in the case of photodetection , _ we associate the probability distribution for the occurrence of a hit with the temporal intensity profile of the photon that reach the detector_. also , it is very important to realize that @xmath1 must not be confused with the moment when the pointer comes to a definite position , that is , when the avalanche photodiode ( apd ) delivers a macroscopic current .",
    "this time scale has been studied in different perspectives @xcite .",
    "it is an essential part of our hypothesis that this macroscopic phenomenon is preceded by a microscopic event that triggers the collapse of the state ket at @xmath9 .",
    "the system we address here is composed of two spatially separated photons which are simultaneously generated , and led to the entangled polarization state @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to the photons sent to the  left \" and  right \" detectors , respectively ( fig .",
    "the generation can be achieved with a non - linear crystal via a parametric downconversion process , which , in general , gives synchronization and may also produce entanglement in polarization @xcite . since the photons follow distinct optical paths , a delay between them is likely to be introduced .",
    "while this is not critically relevant in evaluating violations of bell s inequalities , it may hinder the phenomenon we intend to investigate . up to this point",
    ", the synchronization of the pair can be restored with the help of a hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) apparatus @xcite and delay lines coupled with translation stages . from this point to the detectors",
    "the synchronization is technically non - trivial , but can be handled , in principle .",
    "for a recent proposal of a scheme to measure ultra - short delays see @xcite .",
    "as the photons reach the detectors their polarizations are measured with the filters set in the _ same _ direction , for which @xmath15 are eigenstates .    to be more realistic , we assume that the two wave packets attain the detectors simultaneously ( in the laboratory frame ) , except by a delay @xmath16 that eventually persists ( fig .",
    "2 ) . we stress that our model encompasses the expected situation in which the residual delay is typically much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "note carefully that the procedure ensures that the centroids of each wave packet will reach the detectors approximately at the same time , and not that the ( unpredictable ) hits themselves will be simultaneous .",
    "note also that the spatio - temporal profile to be considered is not that of the generated photons , but rather of the photons just before detection ( with the spreading and deformation taken into account ) . finally , the quantities we suggest to be measured are subtle statistical deviations , so we need a robust sampling .",
    "this demand naturally leads us to consider that a pulsed laser with a high repetition rate is employed as the primary source of photons .",
    "[ figure1 ]     from basic quantum mechanics we immediately infer the statistical distribution resulting from a series of @xmath17 coincidence polarization measurements on state ( [ state1 ] ) , see table [ table1 ] .    .outputs and relative frequencies of two sequential polarization measurements in the same direction according to quantum mechanics .",
    "the second measurement plays no role since , after the first one , the state collapses instantly . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above table might give the impression that we are suggesting a correction to born s postulate .",
    "this is not the case , since the postulate refers to the likelihood of each possible result of a single measurement .",
    "if collapse is indeed instantaneous , a second measurement of the same observable would be innocuous .",
    "what we have just shown is that , if the collapse takes a finite time , then a close consideration of born s rule leads to the probabilities in table [ table2 ] .",
    "once a sufficiently large number @xmath17 of repetitions is made , the numeric difference between the results @xmath18 and @xmath19 , according to table [ table1 ] is @xmath20 , while the same quantity , according to table [ table2 ] , is @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the deviation between the two scenarios is given by @xmath22 it is clear that a maximally entangled state , with @xmath23 , would not reveal a potentially non - vanishing result .",
    "the initial state ( [ state1 ] ) have to be unbalanced .",
    "as we will see next , @xmath24 is typically a very small number and the difference ( [ difference ] ) is subtle .",
    "the immediate question that arises is , being @xmath25 small , can we safely distinguish it from pure statistical fluctuations ( @xmath26 ) that surely occur in an actual experiment ?",
    "fortunately , the deviation in the worse scenario , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 tend to minimize @xmath29 for @xmath30 , is @xmath31 , while @xmath32 , so that for a sufficiently large number of realizations one can reach a ratio @xmath33 as large as needed .",
    "in fact , @xmath34 , and the number of realizations must satisfy @xmath35^{-2}\\;,\\ ] ] for a statistical significance of @xmath36 standard deviations ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "once the general framework is set , let us examine a specific example .",
    "suppose the source of light is a pulsed titanium - sapphire laser whose temporal profile of intensity reads @xmath38 where the pulse width @xmath39 provides the coherence time . by using ( [ delay ] ) and ( [ prob ] ) we get @xmath40\\right.\\\\ \\left . -2\\coth(a_n)\\tanh(\\delta t/\\sigma_t)\\right\\}\\;,\\hspace{1cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41/\\sigma_t$ ] .",
    "assuming that @xmath4 and @xmath42 are much smaller than the coherence time , the above result simplifies to @xmath43\\;,\\ ] ] leading to the probability distribution @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "a typical repetition rate of a pulsed laser is 100 mhz , however , this is not the frequency at which the correlated pairs are detected in coincidence .",
    "we assume that this rate is diminished in three orders of magnitude , giving one detection in coincidence per 10 @xmath45s , on average .",
    "furthermore , the residual delay is of the order of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the step of the translation stage in the delay line and @xmath48 is the velocity of light .",
    "usually @xmath49 m , so @xmath50 fs .",
    "the duration @xmath0 of each measurement is set to ensure that the detected photons belong to the same pair .",
    "we can safely consider the window of coincidence to be @xmath51 ns .",
    "finally , for the sake of illustration let us assume that the final shape of the wave packets at detection is still given by eq .",
    "( [ profile ] ) , with a relatively large spreading of @xmath52 ps ( the coherence time soon after the generation is , say , 200 fs ) .",
    "consider that we intend to investigate the compatibility of experimental data with a collapse in the range of @xmath53 fs .",
    "this would lead to @xmath54 , corresponding to 10 non - trivial detections per second .",
    "of course , in order to get numbers we must assume some functional form for @xmath55 before calculating @xmath24 .",
    "the quantitative results weakly depend on this choice , but the qualitative features remain unchanged . by choosing an exponential decay for @xmath55 , satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions , we get @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "suppose that , with @xmath57 , we obtain a reliable statistics characterized by @xmath58 ( six standard deviations ) , corresponding to a 12 hour long experiment ( @xmath59 realizations ) .",
    "this result alone would be a strong evidence for finite - time collapse .",
    "of course , further experimentation would be necessary , varying @xmath42 , @xmath60 , and the orientation of the filters , to investigate the actual time dependence of @xmath61",
    ". it would be especially important to repeat the same procedure with the filters set in orthogonal directions for , in this situation , there should be no measurable difference between the two scenarios for any pair @xmath60 , @xmath62 .",
    "conversely , if in the original experiment we obtain @xmath63 , then 0.1 fs would be an upper bound for an exponential reduction in the system studied .",
    "lastly , the above estimates would not change appreciably for @xmath64 , showing that the scheme is robust for delays of order of femtoseconds .",
    "it might be considered insufficient to assert that if the state is @xmath65-ontic , in the sense adopted in the literature @xcite , then the wave function is a real thing @xcite .",
    "a possibly reasonable extra requirement would be that the microscopic collapse should not be instantaneous .",
    "we stress that this has nothing to do with the condition of locality , since the collapse @xmath66 is , in general , non - local , provided that the subsystems are sufficiently far apart . by employing minimal statements ( of kinematic nature ) about this finite - time collapse and assuming that born s rule remains valid during the non - unitary evolution , we claim that it is possible to probe the collapse duration experimentally in the scale of subfemtoseconds .",
    "although decoherence is not a logical necessity of our model , the previous results are not incompatible with it in any obvious way .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested by schlosshauer @xcite that a combination of dynamical localization models and the effects of environment is a promising strategy to approach the collapse problem .",
    "an important point is the lack of covariance of our results , which is not an exception in dealing with entanglement . if we admit that the two hits are not causally related , their ordering may be swapped for some inertial frame . alternatively , if one assumes that the hits are causally connected it is necessary to admit the existence of an  ether \" in which the spatially separated subsystems exchange information via a supraluminal signaling .",
    "a stringent lower bound for the velocity of this signal has been placed @xcite , @xmath67 for a continuous set of referentials whose relative velocity with respect to earth is as large as @xmath68 .",
    "although a detailed discussion of this point is outside the scope of the present work , we believe that the dynamics of collapse , and its time scale , deserves investigation in either case .",
