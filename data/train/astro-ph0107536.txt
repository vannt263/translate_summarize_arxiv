    "approximately 10% of qsos at intermediate and high redshift show strong blueshifted absorption from ionized gas , which is being ejected , perhaps by radiation pressure from the central continuum source .",
    "ejection velocities as large as @xmath11  lead to broad absorption troughs and a classic broad - absorption - line qso spectrum ( balqso , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most absorption features are present below 1600   in the rest frame .",
    "a difficulty with studying this phenomenon in high - luminosity qsos is the severe overlapping of the broad troughs that even mask the underlying continuum .",
    "the uv spectra obtained with  and  open new windows , enabling one to study the absorption features at wavelengths well below 1200    ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in low - luminosity qsos ,",
    "the velocity range is smaller , up to @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the absorption features in these objects may not be considered as `` broad '' when compared with those in high - luminosity counterparts ( @xcite ) , but they are significantly broader amd more displaced than the intrinsic absorption features in seyfert-1 galaxies . thus , these mini - bal objects offer a possible extension of the balqso sample into the low - redshift domain ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the relatively low velocity structure makes separating and identifying individual components in the absorption trough much easier . at low redshifts ,",
    "there is less confusion from intervening lines .",
    "the nature and location of the absorbing gas is not known .",
    "since the cores of emission lines are sometimes completely absorbed , the absorbers must lie at least somewhat beyond the broad emission - line region .",
    "if the absorption covering fraction with respect to the nuclear continuum is near 100% , the bal phenomenon would be unique to a special group of objects , which would be physically different from all other `` normal '' active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "conversely , if the covering factor is small , it is possible that most qsos contain such outflows .",
    "they are then only recognized as balqsos if our line of sight to the central continuum source happens to pass through the outflow ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite found that the distribution of bal in their radio - selected sample is not consistent with a simple unified model in which balqso are seen edge on .",
    "the broad - band energy distribution of balqsos has special characteristics .",
    "it has been known that balqsos are not powerful radio sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the number of high - ionization balqsos drops significantly for qsos with a radio - loudness parameter @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite found a small excess of narrow absorption toward radio - loud qsos and toward lobe - dominant qsos .",
    "there is also a small excess of high - velocity c  iv  absorbers in radio - quiet qsos as compared to radio - loud quasars .",
    "balqsos are weak in the x - ray band ( @xcite ; @xcite ; brandt , laor , & wills 2000 ) .",
    "the average power - law index @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) derived between 2500   and 2 kev is @xmath16 , as compared to @xmath17 for other low - redshift qsos ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the x - ray level in balqsos is about one order of magnitude weaker than average ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of such distinctions is poorly understood , and further studies may reveal special physical conditions that are intrinsically associated with the bal phenomenon .",
    "pg  1351 + 64  ( z=0.088 ) is one of the few mini - bal qsos identified at low redshifts .",
    "its  spectrum ( @xcite ) displays significant broad absorption in ly@xmath3  and c  iv .",
    "a tentative analysis of the  faint object spectrograph ( ) spectra identifies at least three absorption components in the blue wings of c  iv , ly@xmath3 , and other uv lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "this object exhibits a weak x - ray flux around 1 kev , with a power - law index of @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",

    "it features multiple mirrors , rowland - circle spectrographs and two - dimensional detectors .",

    "the  observations of pg  1351 + 64   were carried out between 2000 january 18 and 20 , for a total exposure time of 70 ks .",
    "the observations were made with the @xmath21 low - resolution aperture . because of a slight mis - alignment between the optical systems , not all detector channels record signals that are of photometric quality .",
    "some data in this observation suffer from unexpected abnormalities that have not been fully understood during the calibration process .",
    "we first combined all the raw data to produce four images in different detector segments .",
    "two spectra were extracted from the two - dimensional data on each segment .",
    "these eight extracted spectra were dark subtracted and corrected for the background stray light .",
    "flux and wavelength calibrations were carried out with the standard  calibration pipeline , which assumes a constant value of dark counts . to obtain the best estimate of the zero flux level",
    ", we used the galactic absorption feature c ii 1036  , which appears in all four channels , as a calibrator : i.e. , the very bottom of this absorption feature represents a completely absorbed region , therefore a zero flux level .",
    "we estimate that the flux scale is accurate to @xmath2210% , and that wavelengths are accurate to @xmath2215 .",
    "we have studied all the sections of data from every channel , and only chosen those that are free of abnormalities .",
    "the data near the edge of the detector segments often show an abnormal rise in flux and therefore can not be used .",
    "the spectra were binned by 5 pixels , to preserve the full spectral resolution of @xmath23 for this observation .",
    "the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "1 is produced by binning the data by 20 pixels ( 0.12  ) to show the overall appearance of the spectrum .",
    "the s / n level around 1080   is considerably poorer , because of gaps in the wavelength coverage from the various detectors .    as part of a joint -  project ,",
    "two complementary   snapshot observations were made on 1999 october 28 .",
    "the exposure was 600 s for the observation with the g140l grating , and 300 s with g230l . due to the short exposures and low source flux ,",
    "the  spectra do not have an adequate s / n level for fitting line profiles .",
    "we therefore retrieved archival  spectra of pg  1351 + 64 , which has a spectral resolution of @xmath24 .",
    "the  spectra between 1150 and 3300   of pg  1351 + 64  were obtained on 1991 september 5 .",
    "the exposure time for the g130h , g190h , and g270h spectra were , respectively , 3200 , 3000 , and 1400 s. the flux levels of the  and  spectra match each other to within 10% .",
    "we used the _ iraf _ task specfit ( @xcite ) to fit the  and  data .",
    "the wavelength scale of  data was slightly shifted with respect to the galactic absorption features in the spectra , and we made a correction for the offset . the o  vi  emission features ( see fig .",
    "1 ) were fitted with four gaussian profiles : a narrow doublet and a broad doublet . for the ly@xmath2 , ly@xmath3 , n  v ,",
    "c  iv  and mg  ii  emission lines , a narrow component and a broad one were assumed for each .",
    "other emission lines were fitted with one gaussian profile .",
    "we fixed the widths and velocities of the two components of ly@xmath2   to that of ly@xmath3 , and linked n  v  with that of c  iv  ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the absorption lines were treated as gaussians in optical depth , and they were allowed to partially cover the emission components .",
    "note that the covering factor is along the line of sight , not the overall value around the source as described in section 1 .",
    "the wavelengths of the o  vi  doublets were linked at the ratio of their laboratory values , and their relative optical depths were fixed at a 2:1 ratio .",
    "we used five ( a , b , c , d & e ) components to fit the o  vi  absorption doublets , and fixed the widths and covering factors of the other absorption lines to that of o  vi , linking the velocities to that of o  vi  ( a small linear shift in wavelength is permitted for lines from different detectors ) .",
    "the only exception is component e : its covering factor can not be well constrained by o  vi  as it is too weak .",
    "we derived the covering factor for component e from the c  iv  absorption features in the  data .",
    "component e of ly@xmath2  is apparently narrower than its counterparts in other lines , so we set it free to vary .",
    "because of different data quality , the  data and  spectra were fitted separated , with only several linked parameters as discussed above .",
    "galactic lyman - line absorption was modeled with the best estimated hydrogen column density and a varying doppler parameter .",
    "an extinction correction of @xmath25 was applied using the estimated galactic hydrogen column density of @xmath26 ( @xcite ) , and the correction curve of @xcite with @xmath27 .",
    "the spectrum between 1100 and 1140   is plotted in fig .  2 to show details of the o  vi  features and the goodness of the fit .",
    "we obtained optical spectroscopy of pg 1351 + 640 using the goldcam spectrograph mounted on the 2.1-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "goldcam currently uses a ford 1000 @xmath28 3000 pixel ccd detector , with a useful area of 400 @xmath28 @xmath222400 pixels in which a long slit spectrum is focused and can be well calibrated .",
    "the blue spectrum ( @xmath223200 - 5900   useful coverage ) was obtained through a wide slit ( 6@xmath29 ) and using a 500 l  mm@xmath30 grating blazed at 5500   ( resolution @xmath229  ) for 300 s on 2000 , february 25 ( ut ) .",
    "weather conditions were generally good on that night , but variable seeing ( up to 3@xmath29 ) and some thin clouds resulted in non - photometric spectra .",
    "the red spectrum ( @xmath225800 - 9800   useful coverage ) was formed by combining narrow slit ( 15 ) observations from two nights , both taken using a 400 l  mm@xmath30 grating blazed at 8000   ( resolution @xmath2212  ) and an og 550 order - blocking filter : the exposure time on february 25 was 400 s , and on february 26 900 s. the spectra were weighted by their counts in the combination .",
    "standard stars were used to divide out atmospheric absorption , but the air masses were not well matched and the division is imperfect .",
    "the red spectrum flux level was scaled to match that of the blue , which in turn was scaled up by a factor of 1.67 to match that from the  spectrum ( although the signal - to - noise ratio in the region of overlap was only 3 , making the absolute scaling factor uncertain ) .",
    "we employed standard data reduction techniques within the noao iraf package .",
    "archival  position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) data were retrieved from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) at nasa goddard space flight center .",
    "we use the data taken in 1993 october , with an exposure time of 3776 s. the  spectrum was fitted using _",
    "xspec _ ( @xcite ) with a single power law and galactic absorption .",
    "the fits generated satisfactory results ( @xmath31 ) for most spectra .",
    "our results yield a photon power index @xmath32 for a fixed column density of @xmath33 , in good agreement with rush & malkan ( 1996 ) .",
    "dual power laws produced only minimal improvements , and therefore they were not used in the final results .",
    "4 shows the unfolded spectrum with error bars that reflect the combined contributions from propagation errors , known flux variations , and the uncertainties of the galactic column density ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "fig . 5 displays the profiles of seven major uv emission lines and the h@xmath3  line .",
    "the fitted parameters for the uv lines are listed in table 1 .",
    "we will focus our discussion on the features longward of 1050   because of their higher signal - to noise ratios .",
    "the most significant finding is the weak o  vi  emission : its intensity measured on the red wing is only about 28% of that of c  iv  or 8% of that of ly@xmath3 , which is among the lowest in all agn and qsos .",
    "the o  vi / ly@xmath3  ratio in the qso composite spectrum of zheng et al . ( 1997 ) is only @xmath35 .",
    "2 shows the full profile of the o  vi   emission .",
    "the broad o  vi  component appears to be even weaker : the o  vi / ly@xmath3  ratio between the broad components is only @xmath36 .",
    "there is an excess of flux on the blue wings of the balmer lines , as shown in fig .",
    "such a bump is also seen in another published spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "we fitted each of the balmer lines with gaussian profiles , which are a poor match .",
    "the fitted profiles are displayed with dashed curves .",
    "the excess blue flux may be due to electron scattering or from the outflowing matter that is part of the broad - line region .",
    "the  spectra reveal two emission lines at @xmath37 and 1168  , and we tentatively identify them as s iv @xmath1@xmath11062,1073 . such a feature has been noticed , but without a firm identification , by @xcite ( 1994 , 1995 ) , and @xcite .",
    "it is also noted as absorption in the spectrum of ngc 4151 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wavelength of 1168  coincides with the second - order feature of the terrestrial airglow line he i , but the feature is much broader than any airglow line . at lower spectral resolution",
    ", such features may have been found as part of the red wing of the o  vi  profile in the hst qso composite spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fitted he  ii  emission component is very broad , and it includes blended features such as an unidentified component at @xmath38   ( laor , et al . 1994 , 1995 ) .      in table 2",
    "we list the measurements of major absorption lines , named as components a , b , c , d , and e. the absorption present in the  data is also obviously present in the  spectrum . for components",
    "a , b , c , d , the line velocities and widths derived from the  data can also fit the  data well , but the derived h i column densities are quite different ( higher than ) .",
    "this may well be due to the lower resolution of  data , and saturation in the ly@xmath3  profile .",
    "the presence of mg  ii  absorption is highly uncertain as no individual components can be seen .    to determine physical conditions in the absorption components , we used cloudy ( ferland et al . 1998 ) to calculate models . in a grid of photoionization calculations , we vary the ionization parameter @xmath39 from 0.001 to 30 .",
    "we used a broken power - law ionizing continuum with indices of @xmath40 and 0.7 between 13.6 ev-2 kev and 2 - 10 kev , respectively , and assumed a hydrogen density of @xmath41  and solar abundances .",
    "however , variations of these parameters do not affect the results significantly .    because the  and   data were not obtained simultaneously , and because of the higher spectral resolution of the  data",
    ", we will focus on  data . for components",
    "a , b , c , d , we detected obvious o  vi  and ly@xmath2  absorption . from our grid of photoionization models ,",
    "we determine the total column density and the ionization parameter @xmath39 based on the observed relative h i and o  vi  column densities . with no other constraints ,",
    "this method can lead to double - valued results for the ionization parameter and column density since the ratio of o  vi  to h i will rise to a peak and then decline when @xmath39 increases . however , we note that the presence of clear c  iii  absorption in components a , c , d restricts the solutions to the lower ionization parameter in these cases , thus yielding small ionization parameters ( @xmath42 ) , and a total column density @xmath43 .",
    "even if we choose a model with a high ionization parameter , the total column density is on the order of @xmath10 , insufficient to cause significant x - ray obscuration .",
    "table 3 lists the column densities derived ionization parameters for the five absorbers .",
    "the continuum in the  data is fitted with a power law of @xmath44 .",
    "the fitted power - law index for the  data is @xmath45 , which is considerably flatter than that for the  data .",
    "this suggests a change in the continuum shape around 1050   in the rest frame , consistent with but even more dramatic than that found in typical qsos ( @xcite ; kriss et al .",
    "2000@xmath46 ) .",
    "to make sure that this is not an extinction effect , we carried out a continuum fit to the combined -  spectrum in the wavelength region below 2000  . a simple power law with variable extinction yields a significantly poorer fit ( best fitted value @xmath47 ) than a broken power law with a fixed galactic extinction ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "therefore , the break in the continuum is intrinsic .",
    "zheng et al . ( 1997 ) suggested that compton scattering in a hot corona above the disk modifies the exponential turnover of the thermal disk spectrum into a power law in the euv band . in the case of pg  1351",
    "+ 64 , a corona with lower temperature than average may produce the steep euv / soft x - ray power law .",
    "the extrapolation of the soft  continuum leads to the weak x - ray level that has been observed .",
    "@xcite observed a weak x - ray flux level and a steep x - ray spectrum ( photon index @xmath49 ) in their  observations pf pg  1351 + 64 , which is consistent with an extrapolation of our  spectrum .",
    "the continuum between the uv and soft x - ray bands can be approximated with a power law with @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the short baseline in the sub - ly@xmath3  region does not allow us to assess whether the far - uv and the soft x - ray continuum can be approximated with a single power law .",
    "however , to a first approximation , such a soft euv continuum may be common among low - luminosity agn with broad absorption .",
    "another similar qso , pg1411 + 44 , shows an even softer x - ray to uv flux ratio with @xmath50 ( @xcite ) .",
    "green & mathur ( 1996 ) suggested that a torus of total column density of @xmath51  may produce a significant depression of the soft x - ray flux .",
    "but in pg  1351 + 64 , the weak soft - x - ray flux is consistent with the far - uv continuum shape .",
    "furthermore , we do not see signs for obscuring material of such high column density in the uv or in the optical data .",
    "green et al . (",
    "1995 ) analyzed the data of all balqsos in the rosat all - sky survey and found that they are either highly absorbed or underluminous in the soft x - ray bandpass .",
    "they suggest that the weak x - ray level may be due to heavy obscuration .",
    "@xcite find a significant correlation between the x - ray weakness in agn and the strength of the c  iv  absorption and suggest that absorption may be the cause of the weak x - ray flux . in the case of pg  1351 + 64 ,",
    "the photoionization calculations and the lack of an intrinsic lyman edge suggest that the total nucleon column density is less than @xmath52 .",
    "this is not sufficient to obscure the x - ray continuum , and the soft uv - x - ray continuum is probably intrinsic .",
    "it has been suggested that radio - quiet qsos with weak [ o  iii ]  and strong fe ii emission spectra form a class of qsos that has a high probability of exhibiting bal in their spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in the two balqsos 0759 + 65 ( @xcite ) and 1700 + 51 ( @xcite ) , significant mg  ii  absorption and continuum extinction are also present . in this regard ,",
    "pg  1351 + 64  does not fit this category : its [ o  iii ]  intensity is about the same as the h@xmath2  line , the intensity of its optical fe ii emission is only moderately weak , and no mg  ii  absorption is obvious in pg  1351 + 64  ( fig .",
    "5 ) .    in terms of uv spectral features ,",
    "pg  1351 + 64  bears a strong resemblance to pg1411 + 44 .",
    "their nearly identical redshifts make the two spectra remarkably alike .",
    "there are significant spectral differences however : ( 1 ) pg 1411 + 44 has weaker o [ iii ] emission , by a factor of about four , with respect to the h@xmath2 ; and strong optical fe ii features are present ; and ( 3 ) pg 1411 + 44 s soft - x - ray flux level is significantly lower ( by a factor of three or more ) ; and ( 4 ) its he  ii  @xmath1 1640 emission is exceptionally strong , suggesting a harder ionizing continuum in the euv band .",
    "laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the x - ray spectrum of pg1411 + 44 above 2 kev exhibits a significant upturn , suggesting strong obscuration in the soft x - ray band .",
    "since pg  1351 + 64  does not present such characteristics , it may belong to a different group despite the similarity of its ly@xmath3  and c  iv  absorption to that of pg1411 + 44 .",
    "the ionization structure of the absorbers in pg  1351 + 64  seems to be comparable to the uv absorption components seen in many seyfert-1s ( e.g. , ngc 4151 : kriss et al .",
    "1995 ; ngc 3516 : kriss et al .",
    "1996@xmath53 ; mrk 509 : kriss et al .",
    "2000@xmath54 ) and with those observed in many high - redshift objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , albeit at a smaller ejection velocity .",
    "most of these objects do not show broad mg  ii  absorption lines , and the c  iv , n  v , and o  vi  column densities are at a comparable level to pg  1351 + 64 .",
    "more work is needed , however , to understand the difference in their x - ray properties .",
    "pg  1351 + 64  is one of the handful of mini - balqsos .",
    "the  spectrum allows us to identify and measure five kinematically distinct components .",
    "model calculations with multiple species suggest column densities on the order of a few @xmath55  for the absorbing clouds .",
    "these clouds would not produce significant absorption in the soft x - ray band .",
    "therefore the object s weak x - ray flux may be intrinsic unless there is significant absorption from more highly ionized material .",
    "additional evidence in support of an intrinsically weak x - ray flux exists from the very weak o  vi  emission , as well as the significant downturn of the far - uv continuum shortward of 1050  .",
