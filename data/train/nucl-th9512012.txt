    "a number of recent experiments have provided tantalizing hints that the strange quark sea within the nucleon may play a major role in determining its physical properties .",
    "most notably , the strange quarks may be polarized and a major contributor to the spin of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "( the fraction of the proton s spin carried by the strange quark sea is usually denoted by @xmath1 . ) this interpretation is somewhat controversial @xcite , but remains the favored explanation of the experiments which measure the spin distribution of the nucleon .",
    "if the strange quark sea is polarized and contributes significantly to the nucleon s spin , then there are numerous implications for particle and nuclear physics as well as astrophysics . among these are effects on neutral current interactions @xcite and more exotic effects on processes such as neutralino - nucleus scattering ( which is of fundamental importance in the search for particle dark matter @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus upon inelastic neutrino - nucleus , @xmath2 , interactions . in particular , we examine the effects of @xmath3 in the nucleon upon the neutral current gamow - teller ( gt ) strength in a number of nuclei that are present during supernova collapse .",
    "the gt operator results from the axial - vector current in the non - relativistic and zero momentum - transfer limits ( i.e. the allowed approximation ) .",
    "it is the dominant contribution in @xmath2 inelastic scattering . in the limit where strange quarks do not contribute to nucleonic properties ( the standard case )",
    ", the operator is purely isovector in nature .",
    "the inclusion of nucleonic spin due to polarized strange quarks , however , leads to an important change in the form of the gt operator .",
    "it acquires an _",
    "the zeroth order effect of this change is to increase the neutral current interaction strength of protons relative to that of neutrons @xcite .",
    "this shift results in the redistribution of the neutral current gt strength function , @xmath4 , for a nucleus .",
    "the inclusion of this isoscalar piece in the gt operator circumvents the usual isospin selection rule which forbids @xmath5 transitions .",
    "this can open new transition channels and lead to a significant rearrangement of the low lying gt strength for @xmath6 nuclei .",
    "these new channels may present a method for a precise measurement of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss this possibility in section iii . also of importance",
    "is the effect of the redistribution of @xmath4 upon the neutral current interaction rates .",
    "these rates are of interest as they may affect the neutrino distribution in core collapse supernovae .",
    "it has been realized for some time that inelastic @xmath2 processes may play an important role in the pre- and post - collapse phases of supernovae @xcite .",
    "the interaction rates for all of these inelastic processes are highly energy dependent and hence quite sensitive to the exact distribution of gt strength in nuclei .",
    "the neutral current gt strength distribution undergoes significant shifts if @xmath1 differs appreciably from zero .",
    "hence , the effects of strange quarks in the nucleon could have profound effects upon supernova dynamics .",
    "the effects of a non - zero value of @xmath1 upon @xmath7-process nucleosynthesis @xcite has previously been studied for several nuclei in the continuum random phase approximation @xcite . here",
    "we examine allowed neutral current gt processes which might play an important role in the heating and cooling of the collapsing star . as an example",
    ", we concentrate upon the process of nuclear de - excitation via the emission of a @xmath8 pair ( the neutral current analog of @xmath9-decay ) , @xmath10 .",
    "because of phase space considerations , this process should be especially sensitive to @xmath1 as well as being straightforward to calculate .    supernova cores present an environment where nuclei may develop a large neutron excess .",
    "since a finite @xmath1 increases the strengths of @xmath11 , relative to @xmath12 , interactions there could conceivably be significant changes in the gt strength for nuclei with large neutron - proton asymmetry . an effect which will tend to compensate for this",
    "is pauli blocking as the available neutron orbitals are filled . to investigate these two competing effects we examine the changes in @xmath4 induced by a non - zero value of @xmath1 in a series of iron isotopes with increasing @xmath13",
    ". we will show that fairly significant changes in @xmath4 can occur for very neutron rich nuclei .",
    "our calculations of @xmath4 are performed in the nuclear shell model .",
    "this approach allows an accurate representation of the low lying strength , which is of paramount importance at the temperatures of interest .",
    "the strange quark content of the nucleon plays a role in both the vector and axial - vector pieces of the weak hadronic current .",
    "the full formalism is presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we are concerned only with the axial - vector piece , which has the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 is the usual isovector coupling constant @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the isoscalar coupling arising because of the strange quarks in the nucleon .",
    "the emc data implies a value of @xmath19 @xcite and we adopt this value here .",
    "recent measurements by the smc experiment @xcite have found a slightly lower value for @xmath1 and hence @xmath18 .",
    "we use the larger , emc value , to examine the maximum effect of the strangeness in the nucleon upon @xmath4 . to make this even more pronounced",
    ", we quench the value of the isovector piece by the canonical amount , setting @xmath20 .",
    "the isospin operator has the values @xmath21 for protons ( neutrons ) .",
    "@xmath22 is assumed to have the standard dipole form but this is irrelevant for this work since we work in the @xmath23 limit .    in the zero momentum transfer and non - relativistic limits ( valid for most supernova neutrinos ) eqs .",
    "( [ current],[ff ] ) lead to the neutral current gt operator @xmath24 the familiar form is recovered if @xmath25 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that by including @xmath26 the gt operator will shift the relative strengths of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 interactions which are mediated by it .",
    "( e.g. taking @xmath27 and @xmath18 = -0.38 , we find @xmath28 and @xmath29 . )",
    "also note , that since the operator is no longer purely isovector , @xmath30 transitions are allowed and will be proportional to @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the presence of a non - zero @xmath18   can lead to potentially important changes in the matrix elements for @xmath2 interactions . to determine if this is indeed the case , the modified gt operator , eq .",
    "( [ gtop ] ) , needs to be evaluated between realistic nuclear wave functions and compared with the standard ( @xmath18 = 0 ) results for various nuclei .    to examine the effect of the modified gt operator , eq .",
    "( [ gtop ] ) , upon @xmath2 reactions we have computed states for nuclei in the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 shells .",
    "all of the wave functions and strength functions were generated using the nuclear shell model code cruncher @xcite and its auxiliary codes .",
    "we have studied the @xmath32-shell nuclei @xmath35c and @xmath36n using the cohen - kurath interaction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath33-shell nuclei @xmath37ne , @xmath38 mg , and @xmath39si were all investigated using the w , or universal @xmath33 , interaction @xcite . in these two shells full basis @xmath40 calculations were performed .    in the @xmath34 shell",
    ", we performed calculations for @xmath41ni as well as a large series of iron isotopes using the fpvh interaction @xcite . this interaction has been shown to reproduce excited state energy spectra @xcite and charged current gt strength functions @xcite with reasonable accuracy .",
    "we looked at the even - even isotopes of iron ranging from @xmath42fe to @xmath43fe to study the effect of increasing @xmath13 upon @xmath4 . because of the large dimensions of the @xmath34-shell wave functions , we employed truncated model spaces for all of these nuclei .",
    "( a full basis calculation of @xmath41fe would have a m - scheme dimension of @xmath44 , far larger than can be accommodated using conventional diagonalization techniques . ) in table [ table1 ] , we present the list of @xmath34 shell nuclei examined in this work .",
    "we also list the model spaces considered and the m - scheme basis dimension for both the parent and daughter nuclei .",
    "our daughter spaces are expanded so that we would satisfy the standard charged current sum rule .    in figure",
    "[ spectrum ] , we present the calculated and experimental excited state energy spectrum for the 10 lowest lying states of @xmath41fe .",
    "( the calculated spectrum is for the model space with basis dimension 8738 in table [ table1 ] . )",
    "figure 1 reveals quite good agreement between theory and experiment and supports the idea that the fpvh interaction in these model spaces produces good wave functions for these nuclei .",
    "similarly good agreement is obtained for other nuclei with measured spectra .",
    "another piece of evidence which lends credence to these strength functions is the good agreement between measured and calculated charged current gt strength functions .",
    "aufderheide et al .",
    "@xcite have found reasonable agreement between experiment and theory for several @xmath34-shell nuclei using the fpvh interaction in similar model spaces .",
    "the agreement is much better for @xmath45 than for @xmath46 and , in any case , is not perfect since it requires the usual quenching factor in order to match the magnitude of the measured strength . on the whole , the distribution of strength is well reproduced in their calculations for sufficiently large model spaces .",
    "a similar level of accuracy is expected to hold for the neutral current processes calculated here .",
    "kolbe , et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out , that to first order , the ratio of the proton to neutron cross section varies as @xmath47 . for @xmath48 and @xmath27",
    "we find @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) .",
    "we see already that this effect may be important .    the total gt strength for a given nucleus is thought to scale roughly as @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a single particle transition matrix element between the states , @xmath54 is the occupation number of the initial level , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the fractional number of holes in the final level , @xmath57 .",
    "( [ strength ] ) is subject to the usual gt selection rules .",
    "similar formulae have been used for charged current gt strength functions @xcite . while detailed shell model studies have revealed inadequacies in such an approach for charged current interactions @xcite as well as for the neutral currents @xcite , the above parameterization is quite useful for revealing general trends . for the modified operator of eq .",
    "( [ gtop ] ) with @xmath58 , eq .",
    "( [ strength ] ) must be altered : @xmath59 here , @xmath60 denotes the proton ( neutron ) contribution to the strength .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ modstrength ] ) that , since @xmath61 , the strength can be significantly altered for @xmath58 . however , for nuclei with @xmath62 the effects of the differing matrix elements will tend to cancel .",
    "for nuclei with @xmath63 , fairly significant effects could be observed . since many nuclei in the pre - collapse and collapse phases of a massive star s life cycle",
    "have @xmath64 , weak inelastic neutral current processes could undergo important changes .",
    "a close examination of eq . ( [ modstrength ] ) reveals several competing effects . as @xmath13 increases ,",
    "the naive expectation is for @xmath4 to decrease ( relative to the @xmath25 case ) because of the decrease in @xmath65 .",
    "looking at table [ table2 ] , we see that this trend occurs for @xmath66 to 4 . for @xmath67 , the strength , in iron , increases .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that the @xmath68 and @xmath69 neutron shells are starting to become occupied .",
    "this reduces the fractional number of holes available for the transition .",
    "this is the well known effect of pauli shell blocking @xcite .",
    "this shell blocking becomes increasingly important as the neutrons approach shell closure ( @xmath70 ) . for a completely closed neutron @xmath34 shell , table [ table2 ]",
    "shows that inclusion of strange neutral currents leads to a 42 % increase in the total strength . in @xmath43fe ,",
    "the strength is purely due to proton transitions . in figure [ dbgt0 ]",
    "we plot @xmath71 against @xmath13 for the series of iron isotopes considered .",
    "the competition between the altered matrix elements and shell blocking is clearly visible .",
    "we see that a significant change in @xmath4 can occur in nuclei with a large neutron excess if strange quarks carry a reasonable fraction of the nucleon s spin .    in table",
    "[ table3 ] we present the energy weighted centroid of the neutral current strength for the nuclei considered .",
    "no obvious correlation of the centroid with @xmath13 is apparent .",
    "isotopes where the neutron transitions might be expected to dominate ( large @xmath72 _ and _ @xmath73 ) do seem to have slightly negative centroid shifts .",
    "isotopes dominated by proton transitions ( small @xmath72 _ or _",
    "@xmath73 ) tend to have a positive shift . in figure [ fe58strength ] we present the total strength function for @xmath74fe with and without a contribution due to strange quarks in the nucleon .",
    "this strength function is derived from transitions from 30 approximate eigenstates obtained by performing lanczos iterations upon the collective gamow - teller state @xcite .",
    "transitions which are not converged are spread out over a gaussian distribution with the appropriate width obtained from the computed second moments of the eigenstates .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although we have only considered the effects of increasing @xmath13 for a series of iron isotopes , there is nothing special about iron .",
    "we therefore expect similar behavior for most of the elements present during supernova core collapse .",
    "one set of elements where significant changes in @xmath4 might occur are the @xmath6 ( @xmath75 ) nuclei .",
    "these nuclei will not be abundant in the collapsing core but will be present in the outer envelopes of the star . as mentioned earlier , the presence of a non - zero @xmath18 allows the gt operator to mediate @xmath5 transitions .",
    "this has the effect of re - arranging the low lying gt strength .",
    "we now examine the magnitude of this effect .    in figures [ si28strength ] and [ ni56strength ] we present the strength distributions for @xmath39si and @xmath41ni , both @xmath6 nuclei which will be abundant as a residue of thermonuclear burning in shells within and just above the collapsing core of a massive star .",
    "the solid line in each figure is the standard @xmath25 strength and the dotted line is the strength with @xmath48 . in each figure",
    "at least one new low lying isoscalar transition is apparent .",
    "there is also a shift in the shape of the resonance .",
    "this shift is primarily due to the change in convergence of the lanczos vectors used to determine the strength distribution . for a more detailed discussion of the procedure used to obtain @xmath4 see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "tables [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] show the quantitative shifts in the total strength and centroid of the @xmath6 nuclei respectively .",
    "there is a small , relatively constant , increase in the total strength of about 3 % .",
    "the one exception , @xmath36n , has roughly a 6 % increase and is the only odd - odd nucleus considered here .",
    "we also see a fairly uniform slight decrease in the strength centroid for most of the nuclei considered .",
    "thus , we see , that the redistribution of gt strength in @xmath6 nuclei is not likely to be a large effect .    to confirm the above statement",
    ", we must look at a real physical process .",
    "we choose the process @xmath76 , neutral current de - excitation of a nucleus , in a hot stellar environment .",
    "this process is highly sensitive to the distribution of gt strength and hence should be an excellent indicator of the possible importance of @xmath58 upon inelastic neutral current scattering processes in supernovae .",
    "this process has recently been considered in detail in ref .",
    "here we sketch the details of the calculation .",
    "we consider only decays to the ground state of the nucleus . refs .",
    "@xcite show that these decays dominate the rate for temperatures , @xmath77 , less than about @xmath78 mev for @xmath34 shell nuclei .",
    "a more complete set of final states is required at higher @xmath77 , but the effect we wish to emphasize is well illustrated by decay to this single state .",
    "the neutrino pair energy emission rate from ground - state transitions of a thermal population of nuclear states is @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is now the matrix element connecting the shell model states ( @xmath81 initial , @xmath82 final = ground state ) , @xmath83 is the excited state energy , @xmath84 is the final state s energy , @xmath85 is the initial state angular momentum , and @xmath86 is the nuclear partition function .",
    "we see that there are two effects of a non - zero @xmath18 .",
    "first , from the magnitude of the strength as represented by @xmath87 .",
    "second , from the _ location _ of the strength through the factor @xmath88 .",
    "this latter effect could be particularly important for @xmath6 nuclei where new states become available . in table",
    "[ table4 ] we present results for @xmath89 , for several of the calculated nuclei at @xmath90 mev . in figures [ si28rate ] and [ ni56rate ]",
    "we show @xmath89 as a function of temperature for @xmath41ni and @xmath39si .",
    "the turn over at @xmath91 mev in @xmath41ni is an artifact of only considering ground state decay .",
    "it indicates the need to consider decay to more states than just the ground state above this temperature .",
    "looking at table [ table4 ] and figures [ si28rate ] and [ ni56rate ] , it is once again evident that the effect of the strangeness content of the nucleon is typically of order a few percent for most nuclei .",
    "@xmath43fe is somewhat of an exception to the above statement . for this nucleus @xmath70 and there are _ no _ allowed neutron transitions in our model space .",
    "thus , we see the full effect of the enhanced @xmath11 interaction strength .",
    "this is already obvious from the large value of @xmath71 in table [ table2 ] .",
    "this produces a commensurate increase in @xmath89 .",
    "table [ table4 ] shows that @xmath89 increases by @xmath92 relative to the @xmath25 value at @xmath93 mev . this is comparable to the naive estimates made at the beginning of section iii . in figure [ fe66rate ]",
    "we show @xmath89 for the decay to the ground state as a function of temperature .",
    "unfortunately , this large enhancement of neutrino energy emission is likely to occur only for nuclei with @xmath70 .",
    "if at any point in the collapse this condition is encountered , cooling due to neutral current de - excitation could be greatly enhanced .",
    "additionally , @xmath34 shell nuclei with @xmath70 have no allowed electron capture strength , further increasing the significance of this process in this regime .",
    "of course , excitations out of our model space into the @xmath94 shell would tend to smooth over this enhancement by allowing the neutrons to once again contribute to the rate .",
    "other inelastic neutral current processes , such as both up and down @xmath2 scattering and @xmath7 pair annihilation onto a nucleus ( @xmath95 ) will respond similarly to a non - zero @xmath18 . for these processes",
    ", there will be identical shifts due to the altered matrix elements , @xmath80 , but the phase space will scale less steeply than the @xmath88 factor encountered in eq .",
    "( [ epsdot ] ) .",
    "thus , we see that the strangeness content of the nucleon plays , at most , only a minor role in the energy exchange and transport in the collapsing cores of massive stars .",
    "( if the star passes through a regime where @xmath70 nuclei are extremely abundant , the strangeness might play a very important role . )",
    "the equally interesting question of the effect of @xmath58 upon @xmath7-process nucleosynthesis has been previously investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we close this section by briefly mentioning the possibility of using inelastic neutral current @xmath2 scattering to determine @xmath18 .",
    "this possibility has been explored for several nuclei in refs .",
    "one idea is to use a @xmath6 nucleus and look for a neutrino mediated transition to a @xmath6 excited state via its subsequent decay(s ) to the ground state . in the regime where the allowed approximation applies ,",
    "the @xmath7 excitation cross section is proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "hence , an excitation to a @xmath6 state would determine a value for @xmath18 ( e.g. provided a sufficiently detailed and accurate nuclear model is available ) .",
    "the advantage of this method lies in the fact that the measurement is made in the @xmath96 limit where one would be measuring @xmath1 in the regime of interest .",
    "this stands in contrast to the accelerator experiments ( e.g. emc @xcite , smc @xcite ] ) which measure @xmath1 at large @xmath97 .",
    "the results then have to be extrapolated to the @xmath96 case .",
    "since this extrapolation is through the non - perturbative regime , a great deal of uncertainty is introduced .",
    "while this method is extremely attractive from a theoretical standpoint , it is a challenging experimental task at best .",
    "in this paper we have examined the consequences of a non - negligible value of @xmath1 ( or equivalently , @xmath18 ) upon inelastic @xmath2 interactions .",
    "we have focused upon neutral current gamow - teller processes for a number of nuclei that might be relevant for core collapse supernovae .",
    "all of the calculations have been done in the nuclear shell model in order to obtain an accurate representation of the gamow - teller strength , @xmath4 .",
    "we have focused upon two aspects of the modified gt operator , eq .",
    "( [ gtop ] ) .",
    "the first of these is the deviation , from the @xmath25 case , as the value of @xmath13 changes .",
    "the second is the changes in @xmath4 for @xmath6 nuclei which result from the isoscalar piece in eq .",
    "( [ gtop ] ) .",
    "most of our discussion focuses upon the strength function , @xmath4 , but we have also examined a real physical process which may be important in core collapse supernovae , i.e. the process @xmath98 .",
    "this nuclear de - excitation should be especially sensitive to @xmath18 due to its steep dependence upon the excitation energy .    in the initial collapse of a massive star s core",
    ", nuclei will become very neutron rich , @xmath64 .",
    "the inclusion of a non - zero @xmath18 would then change the ratio of @xmath11 and @xmath12 interaction strengths leading to a redistribution in gt strength .",
    "this redistribution should become more pronounced as @xmath13 increases . in tables",
    "ii and iii we presented our results for both @xmath4 and its centroid with @xmath25 and @xmath48 for a series of iron isotopes with @xmath99 .",
    "we found that @xmath4 initially decreased as @xmath100 increased , in line with expectations .",
    "as the neutron @xmath68 and @xmath69 orbitals began to fill , shell blocking became important .",
    "at this point , proton transitions began to dominate the strength .",
    "thus for large @xmath13 there was a steady increase in @xmath4 .",
    "this change was typically of order 10 % but reached @xmath92 for @xmath43fe .",
    "since there were no new transitions added , just a reweighting of those already present , there was very little change in the position of the strength s centroid .",
    "this implies that the change in @xmath101 , eq . ( [ epsdot ] ) is predominately controlled by the change in @xmath4 and the large phase space factor does not come into play .    for @xmath6 nuclei",
    ", the story is somewhat different . for these nuclei @xmath58 , which leads to a violation of the standard no @xmath5 selection rule for gt transitions .",
    "thus , new interaction channels become available and a significant rearrangement of the strength becomes possible .",
    "we studied @xmath4 in a number of @xmath6 nuclei and found only about a 36 % change in @xmath4 and only a small shift for its centroid .",
    "the results are presented in tables [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] .",
    "we find that despite new channels opening up , the total strength is only slightly modified .",
    "nevertheless , these new channels do , perhaps , present an intriguing method for measuring @xmath1 even though the strength present in these new channels is insufficient to cause a major change in the energy emission rate for the nuclear de - excitation process considered .",
    "we close by noting that a non - zero @xmath18 seems unlikely to produce a significant change in calculated neutral current gt processes @xcite .",
    "the effects are not entirely negligible but will not severely change the dominant neutrino energy emission mechanisms .",
    "this is especially true in that we have used a value of @xmath102 which is probably too large ( the smc finds a smaller , but non - zero , value @xcite ) .",
    "also , we have quenched @xmath103 but not @xmath18 . in that sense",
