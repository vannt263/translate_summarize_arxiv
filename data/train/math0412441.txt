    "since such a quotient is still a koszul algebra the series @xmath221 should have positive coefficients .",
    "this easily implies the required inequality ( see the proof of thm 3.1 of @xcite ) .",

    "for example , let @xmath241 be a pair of hyperplanes in @xmath0 and let @xmath242 , @xmath243 be a pair of linearly independent subsets of @xmath244 points . then for any linearly independent subset",

    "theorem [ mainthm ] does not describe all koszul configurations of points imposing independent conditions on quadrics .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that it is applicable to a set of @xmath218 points in general linear position in @xmath0 only when @xmath264 .",

    "it is well known that the homogeneous coordinate algebra of such a set is quadratic ( by the result of @xcite or by thm .",
