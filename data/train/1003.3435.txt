    "densely - grafted chains on nonadsorbing substrate surfaces form the so - called `` polymer brush''@xcite .",
    "these systems find various important applications @xcite , e.g. as lubricants @xcite , for colloid stabilization @xcite , for tuning of adhesion and wetting properties @xcite , for improving the biocompatibility of drugs @xcite , as protective coatings preventing protein adsorption ( `` nonfouling '' surfaces ) in a biological milieu @xcite , microfluidic chips for biomolecule separation @xcite , etc .",
    "the theoretical description of the conformations of macromolecules in these polymer brushes and their dynamics has been an active topic of research hitherto ( e.g. , @xcite ; for early reviews see @xcite",
    ". also the interaction of the brushes with either the solvent molecules ( e.g. @xcite ) or globular proteins @xcite and/or other nanoparticles ( e.g. , @xcite ) has found much recent attention .",
    "however , in many situations of interest there will also occur free polymer chains in the solution , interacting with the polymers of the brush .",
    "this interaction has received relatively less attention , apart from the case where a polymer brush interacts with a dense polymer melt @xcite .",
    "the latter case is particularly interesting because there is very little interpenetration of the grafted chains in the melt and the free chains in the brush even if their chemical nature is identical ( `` wetting autophobicity '' @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , scaling theory @xcite , self - consistent field @xcite and simulation @xcite have predicted partial penetration of free chains into moderately dense brushes of identical chemical nature in semi - dilute solutions when the monomer volume fraction in solution approaches that of the brush , and this behavior has been confirmed experimentally @xcite . of course , when the polymer solution is very dilute , the brush provides a free energy barrier for penetration of free chains into it and this limits the grafting density that can be achieved when one prepares a brush by grafting chains from solution @xcite ( see also some attempts to model this process by simulations @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , since typically the energy won by the chain end when it gets grafted is of the order of @xmath22 only @xcite , there is a nonzero probability that brush chains get released from the grafting substrate surface and are subsequently expelled from the brush @xcite .",
    "however , most cases studied so far refer to the situation that ( apart from chain end effects ) the chains in the bulk and those in the solution are identical .",
    "it is interesting , therefore , to consider the more general situation when the grafted chains and those in the bulk differ in their chemical nature .",
    "then the problem of compatibility ( traditionally modelled by introducing a flory - huggins @xmath1-parameter @xcite ) between the two types of chains arises .",
    "then , there is also no reason to assume that the length @xmath23 of the grafted chains , and the length @xmath0 of the free chains are equal",
    ". such situations ( in particular , when the grafted and the free chains attract each other , @xmath24 ) are of great interest for modern applications such as protein adsorption ,  antifouling  surfaces @xcite , etc .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no systematic study of the effects of the various parameters ( @xmath25 and monomer concentration of the free chains @xmath26 ) on the amount of absorption and the penetration kinetics has been reported so far .",

    "the dft equations described above are solved simultaneously to obtain the segment density profiles for free and grafted chains .",
    "the equations are solved iteratively using picard algorithm,@xcite with the step size along the @xmath69 coordinate taken to be 0.0325 . the above procedure yields equilibrium segment density profiles for a given set of interaction potentials . in addition to the equilibrium structural properties , we have also studied the kinetics of the adsorption of free chains into the brush , following a switch of the interaction potential between free and grafted segments from repulsive to attractive .",
    "to this end , we have employed the ddft method , which is a dynamical generalization of the dft approach.@xcite mc simulations have indicated that the segment density profiles of the grafted chains are essentially independent of the strength of the attraction between free and grafted segments . accordingly , in our ddft calculations we take @xmath104 to be time independent and focus on the time dependence of the free chain density , @xmath105 .",
    "the time evolution of the segment density profile of free chains is given by the following equation:@xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the non - equilibrium local chemical potential , and dimensionless time @xmath19 is defined according to @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the mobility coefficient .",

    "comparisons for all other values of @xmath0 and @xmath26 are performed using the same conversion factor , while assuming @xmath109 to be inversely proportional to both @xmath0 and @xmath26 .    with the goal of shedding further light on the thermodynamic aspects of the adsorption process , we have also performed self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations of the structural properties as a function of the interaction strength between the segments of the brush and the free chains ( in scft approach this interaction",
    "is characterized by the parameter @xmath1 which is calculated in the standard fashion from the corresponding potential well - depths : @xmath119 ) .",
    "the main motivation behind carrying out scft calculations is the fact that this approach provides a more straightforward way to decompose the free energy into entropic and energetic components , thereby providing a complementary ( to dft ) view of the adsorption process .",
    "the basic equations of the scft method are well known,@xcite and will not be reproduced here for the sake of brevity .",
    "once again , the density profiles for free and grafted chains are written in terms of the propagators , the only major difference from the dft approach being that instead of the equation of state , one employs the incompressibility constraint to set up the equations for the density profiles , which are once again solved iteratively using picard s method .",
    "for example , the equation for the density profile of the grafted chain segments takes the form : @xmath120 where the normalization constant @xmath121 is obtained from the grafting density @xmath102 , and @xmath122 , with @xmath123 .",
    "the hard core potential @xmath124 is independent of the segment type and serves as a lagrange multiplier enforcing the incompressibility condition , meaning that the lattice space is completely filled and no segment overlap occurs .",
    "the density profile of the free chain segments is obtained in a similar way .",

    "in this work we studied a scarcely explored yet important aspect of oligomer and linear macromolecule absorption in a polymer brush - the case of ( more or less ) good compatibility between species in the bulk and grafted chains .",
    "starting from oligomers ( mono- and dimers ) and going up to chain lengths @xmath0 which exceed twice the length @xmath23 of the grafted chains , we have determined the conformation of the absorbed species , the absorbed amount @xmath154 , and absorption kinetics ( the propagation rate into the polymer brush ) at different concentration of the free chains for two cases of moderately to very dense polymer brushes .",
    "in addition , by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft calculations , we have substantially broadened the range of lengths of the grafted chains to @xmath13 in order to test more comprehensively our findings .",
    "the most salient , and - to some extent - unexpected features of linear chain absorption in a polymer brush that we find are :    * the dramatic increase in adsorbed amount @xmath7 with _ growing _ chain length @xmath0 , and * the significant slowdown of absorption kinetics with growing concentration ( i.e. , with the increase of the starting gradient in density ) of the free chains    besides these static and dynamic properties of polymer absorption in brushes , we find that both the absorbed macromolecules and the brush itself largely retain their structure and conformation , as seen in quantities like @xmath203 and the monomer density profile @xmath104 , for different length @xmath0 and concentration @xmath26 of the free chains , and different strength @xmath42 of attraction to the grafted chains .",
    "in particular , the degree to which the brush profile @xmath104 is affected by absorption is found to be much less that anticipated in some earlier theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "nontheless , even within these small changes we observe a slight contraction of @xmath104 at small absorbed amounts @xmath154 while @xmath104 gradually attains its extension roughly to that corresponding to zero concentration of free chains with growing @xmath154 .",
    "an interesting finding which still needs deeper understanding is the observed existence of a critical compatibility @xmath204 ( i.e. , brush - oligomer attraction @xmath205 ) . at @xmath206 we find both in mc as well as in dft / scft that the energy of all absorbed species has a value independent of their size @xmath0 whereas their entropy experiences a minimum .",
    "the critical attraction @xmath205 is manifested by the existence of unique distance from the grafting plane where all monomer density profiles of the free chains intersect . moreover , at @xmath205 the kinetics of free chain absorption into the brush follows a clear cut power law with exponent @xmath207 .",
    "undoubtedly , much more work is needed until all these fascinating new features are fully understood .",
    "last not least , we emphasize the finding of three distinct regimes in the kinetics of free chain absorption as far as the size of the free chains @xmath0 is concerned . in the first regime",
    "the characteristic time for absorption @xmath19 grows rapidly with oligomer length @xmath0 as long as the oligomer size @xmath208 remains smaller than the separation between grafting sites .",
    "the second regime is marked by a slower increase of @xmath19 with @xmath0 and ends roughly at @xmath209 .",
    "the third regime of absorption kinetics holds for @xmath180 ( i.e. , the penetrating free chain can not accommodate within the brush ) and is characterized by a nearly constant @xmath19 as far as length @xmath0 is concerned .",

    "<S> the absorption of free linear chains in a polymer brush was studied with respect to chain size @xmath0 and compatibility @xmath1 with the brush by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and density functional theory ( dft ) / self - consistent field theory ( scft ) at both moderate , @xmath2 , and high , @xmath3 , grafting densities using a bead - spring model . </S>",

    "<S> contrary to the case of @xmath5 when all species are almost completely ejected by the polymer brush irrespective of their length @xmath0 , for @xmath6 we find that the degree of absorption ( absorbed amount ) @xmath7 undergoes a sharp crossover from weak to strong ( @xmath8 ) absorption , discriminating between oligomers , @xmath9 , and longer chains . for </S>",
