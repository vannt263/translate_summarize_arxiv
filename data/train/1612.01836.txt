    "the advent of quantum optomechanics @xcite many exciting unprecedented applications have been demonstrated .",
    "non - reciprocal optomechanics is being considered one of the most interesting effects , which is being actively investigated and pursued @xcite .",
    "the importance of non - reciprocal devices is primarily in demonstration of physics of symmetry - breaking as well as laying grounds for directional amplification of quantum information .",
    "the field of non - reciprocal transmission of signals is also being explored in other related fields to wave propagation such as micro - ring resonators @xcite , two - dimensional electronics @xcite , acoustics @xcite , optics @xcite , and superconductive circuits @xcite .",
    "while fundamental laws of the nature mostly preserve parity - time symmetry @xcite , this does not disallow one to design non - hermitian system scattering matrices , in such a way that signal transmission along opposite directions are inequal .",
    "this concept is a bit far from daily intuition and requires careful system design and engineering .",
    "it is known that non - reciprocal behavior needs a minimum of three interacting modes @xcite .",
    "however , such a minimal system can not be non - reciprocal if two of interacting modes have the same frequency . in that sense",
    ", the resulting non - reciprocal behavior would be actually a uni - directional frequency conversion .",
    "that is why a majority of non - reciprocal systems operate through either up - conversion or down - conversion of frequency in a uni - directional way .",
    "the goal of this presented design is to keep identical input / output frequencies , while retaining high non - reciprocity and/or directional amplification .",
    "the system under consideration consists of four interacting modes @xmath1 with @xmath2 at four input / output ports .",
    "we simplify the design by operation at two identical frequencies , as @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this requirement is imposed by the fact that the incoming signal at the input and outgoing signal at the output ports must have identical frequencies .",
    "hence , ports 1 and 3 may serve respectively as the input and output , while ports 2 and 4 may be used for pumping .",
    "we consider these four modes to sit at the four corners of a square , while identical frequencies appear across the diagonals .",
    "we now let the adjacent modes with different frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 undergo strong hopping interactions .",
    "these four interactions sitting at the four surrounding edges could be equal or different in magnitude , but must have precisely controlled phases as described later .",
    "we also let the pair of modes having identical frequencies to undergo weak parametric interactions . these constitute the diagonals of the square system , across which non - reciprocity or directional amplification is to be maintained .    we observe that the requirement on strength of interactions , as being strong for hopping and weak for the parametric interactions are quite necessary for correct operation .",
    "for instance , in absence of either of the parametric interactions , the overall non - reciprocal feature of the system is lost , so that the presence of both of the diagonals is absolutely necessary for instrinsic nonreciprocity . however , phase of parametric interactions is irrelevant and may be dropped .    hence , the total number of interactions is six , comprising of four hopping and two parametric types .",
    "these complete the system configuration of diamond .",
    ", width=3 ]      the overall hamiltonian @xmath7 of the system consists of two non - interacting @xmath8 and interacting parts @xmath9 , which in the regime of rotating - wave - approximation ( rwa ) may be described as @xmath10 here , the bosonic operators satisfy @xmath11=\\delta_{mn}$ ] and @xmath12=0 $ ] , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the strengths of hopping interactions across the edges , and also @xmath17 is the strength of parametric interaction .",
    "the rwa holds if the pumps driving the hopping and parametric terms are resonant . for this one needs @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for this reason , @xmath20 must hold if interactions are driven by electromagnetic drive fields .    with the conditions stated in the above",
    ", the interaction ( [ eq1 ] ) requires using at least two coherent drive fields , which may be separated by splitters and reach the edges at controlled phases or diagonals at arbitrary phases .",
    "as stated above , the phase of @xmath17 has no effect on the system performance in any of the diagonal parametric interactions .",
    "we may now use the input / output formalism @xcite to assign decay channels to each of the modes through the relevant ports .",
    "this will cause linewidths as @xmath21 with @xmath2 appear in the ultimate formulation , corresponding to the field langevin equations .",
    "because of parametric interactions , an @xmath22 formalism needs to be used as @xmath23\\{a\\}-\\sqrt{[\\gamma]}\\{a_{\\rm in}\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the system vector , and @xmath25={\\rm diag}[\\gamma_1,\\gamma_2,\\gamma_3,\\gamma_4,\\gamma_1,\\gamma_2,\\gamma_3,\\gamma_4]$ ] .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 represents the input fields to the system at the ports .",
    "similarly , one may define @xmath27 as the output fields .",
    "these are related together as @xcite @xmath28}\\{a\\}.\\ ] ] the scattering matrix formalism also requires that @xmath29\\{a_{\\rm in}\\}.\\ ] ] by comparing ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) to ( [ eq2 ] ) we obtain the expression for the scattering matrix in terms of the system matrices as @xmath30=[\\textbf{i}]-\\sqrt{[\\gamma]}\\left(iw[\\textbf{i}]+[\\textbf{m}]\\right)^{-1}\\sqrt{[\\gamma]},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the frequency of interest at either of the four ports and @xmath32 $ ] is the @xmath22 identity matrix .",
    "the scattering matrix now @xmath33 $ ] is then well - defined if the system matrix @xmath34 $ ] is known .",
    "this can be obatined by using the langevin equations given by @xmath35\\\\ \\nonumber & -&[\\hat{a},\\hat{c}^\\dagger]\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\hat{c}+\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\hat{a}_{\\rm in}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma\\hat{c}^\\dagger+\\sqrt{\\gamma}\\hat{a}_{\\rm in}^\\dagger\\right)[\\hat{a},\\hat{c}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is any system operator , which is here taken to be the same as @xmath37 to comply with ( [ eq3 ] ) . now",

    "we may later also assume @xmath44 for further simplification , but the optimum results are dependent on the application .",
    "phases of @xmath15 and @xmath13 should be different to obtain the best results .",
    "now , we are all set , and may proceed to the calculation of non - reciprocity function ( [ eq7 ] ) in terms of frequency @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the resonant frequencies of ports 1,3 and 2,4 , respectively . here , two cases can be distinguished , being referred to as the intrinsic versus extrinsic non - reciprocities .",
    "the intrinsic case is characterized by zero pump power into ports 2 and 4 , which are at frequency @xmath6 .",
    "this is satisfied by putting @xmath47 .",
    "the measure of non - reciprocity ( [ eq7 ] ) then applies . the extrinsic case is defined as the situation where there are input powers at ports 2 and 4 at frequency @xmath6 , which reads @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the measure of non - reciprocity ( [ eq7 ] ) is senseless and should be redefined .      for the moment",
    ", we also notice that the strength of hopping interactions over all four edges should be different to disturb the equilibrium of bridge configuration , in such a way that either @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "this criteria , however , are neither necessary nor sufficient , but rather facilitate obtaining a strong non - reciprocity if both are satisfied . a simple choice which satisfies both is @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    ". generally , the hopping interactions should significantly exceed parametric interactions , and here we choose @xmath54 .",
    "quality factors at ports 1,3 and 2,4 are respectively set equal to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , corresponding to coupling rates @xmath57 at ports 1,3 and @xmath58 at ports 2,4 .",
    "these values are quite typical and might be adjusted with ease to obtain the desirable characteristics .    .",
    "extrema of non - reciprocity between ports 1 and 3 is obtained at @xmath59 corresponding to @xmath60 .",
    "[ fig2],width=3 ]    it is necessary to adjust the phases of hopping coupling rates @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . in principle",
    ", the sum of these four parameters should determine any non - reciprocal behavior , as it is related to the round - trip phase @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the prominent effect of these phases on the non - reciprocity ( [ eq7 ] ) is illustrated .",
    "the response with respect to the change of sign of @xmath66 is unchanged .",
    "as it can be seen , the maxima of non - reciprocal ratio @xmath67 at @xmath68 is obtained when @xmath59 , corresponding to the typical choice @xmath60 .",
    "this confirms the requirement of destructive interference across the loop as the necessary condition for non - reciprocity .    ) across the resonant frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum value is rather small , but may be significantly enhanced by careful selection of parameters.[fig3],width=3 ]    ) versus quality factor @xmath69 and the parametric interaction gain @xmath17 .",
    "the optimum value occurs at @xmath70 and @xmath71 at which @xmath72 .",
    "choice of @xmath73 is much less relevant.[fig4],width=3 ]    ) across the resonant frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the maximum is blue detuned to the amount of @xmath74 and is equal to @xmath75.[fig5],width=3 ]    .[fig6],width=3 ]    .[fig7],width=3 ]    , width=3 ]    .",
    "the reverse gain has largely been suppressed with the aid of pumps at @xmath68.[fig9],width=3 ]    .",
    "the @xmath76 gain window is roughly @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig10],width=3 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the variation of @xmath67 versus frequency @xmath31 around the resonance frequency @xmath5 of ports 1 and 3 is shown .",
    "the maximum is slightly blue - detuned but is very small .",
    "it is possible to optimize this value by appropriate selection of @xmath69 and @xmath17 .",
    "for this reason , we fix @xmath78 and make a contour plot of @xmath67 in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath17 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "optimal values are @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this yields the maximum non - reciprocity of @xmath75 , which is significantly enhanced comparing to the maximum value of only @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "it should be stressed out that these optimized values have been obtained for the above assumed values of port frequencies @xmath5 , @xmath6 as well as hopping interaction rates @xmath13 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 .",
    "it is expected that by appropriate adjusting these values even much higher non - reciprocity could be obtained .",
    "notably , the intrinsic non - reciprocity is not useful for directional amplification , as the calculated forward and backward gains shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are much smaller than unity .",
    "this can be resolved by means of extrinsic configuration discussed in the following .      in the extrinsic configuration",
    ", there is a non - zero pump power at frequency @xmath6 into ports 2 and 4 .",
    "the amplitudes of these could be optimized to obtain the maximal response .",
    "we here proceed with the last set of optimized values obtained for the intrinsic configuration to calculate the optimal pump powers .",
    "normalized to input power incident to the port 1 @xmath80 , the extrinsic measure of non - reciprocity could be now similarly redefined as @xmath81 in which @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 being the normalized auxiliary pumps into ports 2 and 4 .    by making a contour plot of @xmath67 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we are able to obtain the optimal pump values into ports 2 and 4 .",
    "these values are highly non - trivial , found as @xmath85 and @xmath86 .    the optimal extrinsic non - reciprocal response against detuning as been plotted in fig .",
    "the peak non - reciprocal response has been increased very significantly to a very large amount in excess of 130db .",
    "it is fairly easy to obtain directional amplification by manipulating the pump powers at ports 2 and 4 . while the optimal values as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] can boost the non - reciprocal behavior by 120db , the directional amplification needs a directional gain exceeding 0db .",
    "this is contingent on non - optimal values of pump powers , in fact , and can be easily obtained .    here",
    ", we may suppress the pump into port 2 , while pumping hard into port 4 at frequency @xmath6 , say at @xmath87 .",
    "this will easily lead into the highly directional gain as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , with a wide - band non - reciprocity well exceeding 30db as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .    the gain spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] almost scale with the pump power at port 4 , leaving the non - reciprocity response in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] unchanged .",
    "that implies by correctly staging two of such diamonds , and using the extremely high extinction in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and the directional gain in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , there is potential to achieve high directional amplification up to 50db at @xmath88 ( or still more by increasing @xmath89 ) , while having a strongly non - reciprocal response easily as high as 170db .",
    "however , this goal will need careful treatment of reflections at the conjoining port .",
    ", width=3 ]",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated the feasibility of non - reciprocal response in a diamond shaped system . in order to break the symmetry",
    ", it has been needed to have four modes all interacting with the rest .",
    "each mode is coupled via hopping interaction to the nearest neighbors with different phases and magnitudes . however , non - neighboring modes need to undergo parametric interactions .",
    "these parametric interactions have been noticed to be quite necessary for non - reciprocal response and could not be removed , however , their relative phases are insignificant",
    ". optimal interaction phases for obtaining maximum non - reciprocity ratio at the resonant frequency were obtained , amounting to a round - trip phase of @xmath90 .",
    "quality factors of input / output ports versus parametric interaction rate could be significantly enhanced by optimization .",
    "two basic intrinsic or unpumped , and extrinsic or pumped forms were discussed to achieve non - reciprocal behavior . with the aid of pumps",
    ", it was shown that the non - reciprocal behavior could be enhanced by around 120db .",
