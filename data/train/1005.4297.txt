    "moreover , the very existence of the phase transition depends on @xmath5 . below the lower critical dimension fluctuations are strong enough to destroy the ordered phase , and",
    "hence there is no phase transition . in contrast , above the upper critical dimension fluctuations are no longer important , and the critical exponents become the same as in mean field theory .",

    "the @xmath347 limit of the solution of the amplitude equation should yield the static structure factor , which may be compared to simulation data .",
    "we leave the interesting and difficult problem of deriving the full transport equation from these considerations to future work .",
    "we have presented evidence from monte carlo simulations that the main characteristics of interfacial structure and dynamics in the laterally driven stochastic lattice gas model are generic and persist to three dimensions . far above the equilibrium roughening temperature the structure of the interface confined between two walls",
    "is affected by lateral driving in a way similar to that resulting from an increase of confinement ( by reducing the distance between the walls ) of the _ equilibrium _ system .",
    "however , the effect of drive is much weaker in three dimensions than in two , plausible due to the different nature of low - energy interfacial fluctuations , i.e. , the `` spike''-like excitations rather then interface `` wandering '' . in the case of the shear - like drive ,",
    "our findings for the decay of the height - height correlation functions and for the structure factor are in partial agreement with recent results from fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy concerns the behaviour in the vorticity direction .",
    "we have found a decrease of correlation length in this direction whereas hydrodynamic calculations predict an increase .",
    "also , our data show that the structure factor is suppressed both in the drive and the vorticity directions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is concluded that @xmath348 is unaffected in the vorticity direction .",
    "moreover , our results for the interfacial width are in agreement with the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , but the results for the interfacial correlation length in the flow direction are not .",
    "it would certainly be desirable to carry out more studies , experimental , theoretical and simulation - based , to clarify these discrepancies .",
    "nearer ( and also below ) the bulk roughening temperature , the confinement / ordering effect of the drive is reduced , since there are no large fluctuations to `` smoothen out '' .",
    "the picture of an equilibrium system under a greater effective confinement no longer seems to apply for these low temperatures .    the conjecture made in ref .",
    "@xcite for the occurence of lateral transport of interfacial fluctuations is supported by our results in three dimensions .",
    "the transport also occurs for low temperatures below the equlibrium roughening transition .",
    "however , the dynamics of the lateral propagation of capillary waves which gives rise to the observed dispersion relation is still not understood .",
    "a full treatment should include non - linear effects , and treat the time and wave - vector dependence of the fourier amplitude .",
    "further insight , especially into the effect of coupling between bulk and interfacial degrees of freedom , could be gained by considering theoretical models based on the order parameter @xcite .",
