    "whereas we know from the absence of any significant gunn - peterson effect even in the highest redshift quasars that hydrogen reionization of the intergalactic gas must have taken place at @xmath6 , we have much less information about the period at which the bulk of singly ionized helium converted to doubly ionized helium . since late he@xmath4",
    "ionization may significantly change the temperature of the intergalactic gas it is critical to understand this heating if we are to correctly model the growth of structure in the igm , and determine the mapping of the baryon density to observable quantities such as observations of the neutral hydrogen @xmath3  forest and the he@xmath4  @xmath7  opacity .",
    "phenomenological modelling of this event depends critically on the softness of the composite spectrum of the ionizing sources ( e.g.  miralda - escud & rees 1993 ; madau & meiksin 1994 ) , amplified by the subsequent radiative transfer , and such models can not be considered reliable in predicting the high energy ( @xmath8 ) metagalactic ionizing spectrum above the he@xmath4  ionization edge , which determines the fraction of singly ionized helium .",
    "our most direct information on the he@xmath4  opacity is through observations of quasars whose spectra extend to the he@xmath4  @xmath7wavelength . despite the extreme difficulty of these measurements , successful observations of the he@xmath4  @xmath7  absorption",

    "the he@xmath4  @xmath7  opacity shows a marked decrease from a value of @xmath11  in q0302@xmath12003 at @xmath13  to @xmath14  in hs1700 + 6416 .",

    "observation of the intermediate redshift quasar he2347@xmath124342 at @xmath15  shows both ` troughs ' and ` voids ' in the @xmath7  observations , suggesting that at @xmath16  we are seeing fully ionized bubbles interspersed among as yet unionized he@xmath4  regions and that it is at this point that the porosity of regions is approaching unity .",
    "the recent discovery that the bulk of @xmath7  forest absorption with @xmath17  contains associated metals ( songaila & cowie 1996 , hereafter sc ) gives us an alternative approach to the problem since ionization balance in these forest metals provides a diagnostic of the shape of the metagalactic flux in the neighborhood of the he@xmath4  edge . as was first noted in songaila et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the value of / in high ionization systems is critically dependent on the he@xmath4  ionization edge break strength .",
    "this has subsequently been investigated in more detail by sc , savaglio et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and giroux & shull ( 1997 ) , among others .",
    "as will be discussed further here , the bulk of the forest metal line systems at the currently observed redshifts ( @xmath18 ) are high ionization ( / @xmath19 ) and so , unless there is a strong break at the edge , they will have / @xmath19  even for the higher si / c abundances characteristic of low metallicity systems .",
    "therefore , once the he@xmath4  is fully ionized and the igm becomes relatively transparent to the integrated quasar spectrum ( e.g.  in the metagalactic spectrum of haardt & madau 1996 ) , the observed / values should fall in this low range .",
    "sc and savaglio et al . (",
    "1997 ) have shown that , whereas this is generally true at @xmath20 , much higher / values are regularly seen at @xmath5 , suggesting a significant change above this redshift , which would be consistent with the interpretation of the reimers et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observations as showing the redshift at which bubbles begin to overlap . boksenberg ( 1998 ) has recently questioned this result , based on an analysis of the the redshift evolution of the ion ratios in the separate voigt profile components in complex systems rather than in the integrated column densities of the complexes . however , his analysis is based on rather a small sample of systems without clear selection criteria . in this paper ,",
    "i shall use the largest sample to date to demonstrate unambiguously that , irrespective of the method of analysis , there is indeed a rapid jump in the value of / at a redshift just below 3 , and that the ionization stages in the metals are consistent with this being , for most systems , the point at which they change from being ionized by a metalgalactic spectrum that is , at @xmath5 , heavily broken above 54  ev to one that is only mildly broken at the lower redshifts .",
    "the sample and the data reduction are described in  2 and the reader who is primarily interested in the results could safely skip this section .",
    "the evolution of the / and / values with redshift is described in  3 where i show that the presence of a jump in / values at @xmath21  just under 3 is highly significant and does not depend on the method of analysis , whether by total column densities of complex , by the column densities of individual voigt components , or by directly analyzing the distribution of optical depth ratios . in ",
    "4 i consider the overall ionization balance including intermediate ionization stages such as and and high ions such as and using , for those lines that lie primarily within the forest , the optical depth distributions of the ensembles of such lines , which provides a new and robust technique for determining their properties .",
    "the overall ionization balance is broadly consistent with unbroken power law photoionization at @xmath20 ; however , the observation of significant amounts of at @xmath5  requires either the presence of a considerable volume of bubbles permeating regions where the ionizing flux is heavily broken , or the addition of collisional ionization to the simple photoionization models .",
    "finally , the conclusions are briefly summarised in  5 .",
    "the sample was drawn from observations of 13 quasars with complete or near - complete coverage between the quasars lyman alpha and emission lines . all observations ( summarised in table  [ tbl:1 ] )",
    "were made with the hires spectrograph on the kecki 10 m telescope , using a @xmath22  slit , which gives a resolution of @xmath23 , and with total exposure times from 3.3 hours to just over 10 hours .",
    "the approximate s / n per resolution element for each quasar at wavelengths between @xmath7and emission is summarised in table  [ tbl:1 ] and ranges from 60 ( q0256@xmath12000 ) to 330 ( q1422 + 231 ) .",
    "individual exposures were generally set to 40 minutes ( providing a reasonable compromise between minimizing cosmic ray hits and read noise effects ) and with the 2048 tektronix ccd read out with a binning of two in the spatial direction and one in the spectral direction , resulting in a spatial pixel of @xmath24  and @xmath25 ; this substantially oversamples the resolution element . for the higher redshift quasars several settings of the hires cross - disperser",
    "were used to provide the full wavelength coverage . all but",
    "three of the quasars have full coverage of the wavelength region of interest ( table  1 , column 4 ) and the remaining three have small interorder gaps . in general , the spectra extend from approximately @xmath26 , below which the hires sensitivity begins to fall rapidly , up to the wavelength of the quasar s emission .",
    "a white dwarf star and the thorium - argon calibration lamp were also observed either immediately before or immediately after each sequence of exposures on a quasar .",
    "a relatively straightforward extraction technique was used since optimization does not provide substantial gains for these spatially undersampled and signal - dominated spectra .",
    "starting from approximate order and wavelength solutions , the position and shape of each order on the ccd was determined from the observations of the white dwarf . only orders lying fully on the ccd were extracted .",
    "a small number of known bad points and columns were cleaned by interpolation , and a number of regions , such as the central blemish on the chip , flagged as unusable .",
    "the first pass cosmic ray rejection was made by forming a residual image with a 5-point two - dimensional median subtracted and then subtracting an 11-point row by row median .",
    "any points in this differenced image that exceeded expected values by more than @xmath27  were interpolated from neighboring points along the column ( spatial ) direction .",
    "the spectral image was distorted by bilinear interpolation to make the echelle order parallel to the rows .",
    "the sky was then determined from the median of pixels on the same column lying between @xmath28  and @xmath29  on either side of the maximum signal , and subtracted from the spectral image , and the spectrum was extracted in a @xmath30  window .",
    "the spectra for all the sub - exposures were then combined with an optimal s / n weighting , and any residual cosmic ray structure was removed by identifying any strongly deviant ( @xmath31 ) points in the individual spectrum and flagging and removing these from a second and final summation .",
    "the blaze function was determined from a normalised fifth - order polynomial fit to the white dwarf spectrum , iteratively repeated to exclude any absorption lines , and divided into the spectrum . the wavelength and spectrum for each order were then individually stored .",
    "the th - ar calibration spectrum was extracted in the same fashion as the object spectrum but without any sky subtraction step . for each order ,",
    "each of the stronger unblended calibration lines was fitted with a gaussian to determine its centroid , and a third - order polynomial fit was then applied to determine the wavelength solution . from 10 to 30 calibration lines",
    "were used for each order and the r.m.s .",
    "residual was normally less than @xmath32 , so that velocities should be accurate to better than @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the wavelength scale was converted to vacuum heliocentric , which is used throughout the present paper .",
    "a typical extracted order longward of the forest is shown in figure  [ newfig:1a ] which shows order 63 from a 2-hr exposure of q1159 + 123 , obtained as three 40-minute exposures in 1997 april .",
    "the absorption lines in the center of the order are a doublet , and the rise in flux to shorter wavelengths reflects the onset of the quasar s @xmath7  and emission .",
    "figure  [ newfig:1b ] shows an order in the forest blueward of the quasar s",
    "@xmath7  emission , where the accuracy of the sky subtraction may be gauged from the precision with which the bases of the saturated lines approach zero .",
    "a final combined spectrum was made from all the observations taken at all echelle settings , with spectra covering each order added in a s / n optimized fashion to form a combined spectrum of that order",
    ". the final 8-hr spectrum of order 63 in q1159 + 123 is shown in figure  [ newfig:2 ] for comparison with figure  [ newfig:1a ] .",
    "an associated effective exposure time vector , normalised by the s /",
    "n , was also maintained at each point ; this can be combined with the counts to determine the noise at each point in the spectrum .",
    "for some purposes it is useful to have a combined spectrum and this was formed by interpolating all the orders to a uniform ( @xmath34 ) grid which provides nyquist sampling throughout the wavelength range .",
    "a typical spectrum ( of q1159 + 123 ) is shown as figure  [ newfig:3 ] .",
    "this spectrum has a lyman limit system just longward of @xmath35  and stretches through to emission just below @xmath36 , near the atmospheric a band , which can be clearly seen in the spectrum .",
    "most of the remaining features between @xmath7  and emission are absorption line doublets .    for most purposes normalized ( continuum fitted )",
    "spectra from each order were used .",
    "the continuum fitting is made on a @xmath37  region of interest by iterating a second - order polynomial fit to a 10-point smoothed spectrum and rejecting significantly deviant regions ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the fit to the region around a complex at @xmath39  in q1159 + 123 is shown in figure  [ newfig:4 ] .",
    "multiple voigt profiles were then fitted to the absorption line profiles using the idl version of bevington s curvefit algorithm .",
    "each quasar spectrum was first searched for all complexes of doublets redward of the l@xmath40  forest and outside of the quasar s proximity zone , defined to stretch to @xmath41  blueward of the quasar s redshift .",
    "the sample was then restricted to those cases for which also lies redward of the quasar s",
    "@xmath7  emission .",
    "the redshift range used for each quasar is summarised in table  [ tbl:1 ] .",
    "voigt profiles were next fitted to each such complex .",
    "the choice of the number of voigt components is somewhat arbitrary because of the problems of blending but the complexes are quite weak in general and in the absence of saturation the integrated column densities of complexes should be well determined . in the same way , integrated column densities or upper limits for , and were determined for lines lying longward of the forest . the usable redshift range for is also shown in table  [ tbl:1 ] .",
    "the profile fits to the and doublets in all the cloud complexes with @xmath42 are shown in figure  5 .",
    "the redshifts , number of voigt components ( a minimum of two was used ) , column density , column density , and and column densities ( where these lines are redward of the forest ) are summarised for all complexes with @xmath43  in table  [ tbl:2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the evolution of the integrated value of / in the 76 complexes with @xmath44  as well as in the the higher redshift systems satisfying this condition in savaglio et al.s ( 1996 ) observations of q0000@xmath12263 . as sc and savaglio et al .",
    "( 1996 ) previously noted , / increases considerably between @xmath45  and @xmath46 , with a strong suggestion of a break in the distribution of values around @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the / ratio shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] does not exhibit this behaviour : in most of the complexes where / can be measured , it is weak ( @xmath47 ) or undetected , regardless of redshift .",
    "median values of / are shown as a function of redshift in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the median ratio is @xmath48  for all the systems below @xmath2  but @xmath49  above @xmath2 , where the errors are @xmath50  computed using the median sign method .",
    "a key diagnostic in interpreting the data is whether the evolution is in the form of a step function or is a smoother change with redshift .",
    "a discontinuous change might arise from the effects of a change in the metagalactic ionizing spectrum at the he@xmath4  ionization edge , whereas a smoother evolution might follow from the more general evolution of the external ionizing field and the range of internal densities and internal ionization in the complexes .",
    "the data of figure  [ fig:2 ] and figure  [ fig:4 ] are strongly suggestive of an abrupt transition between @xmath1  and @xmath2 .",
    "this redshift is slightly higher than , but comparable to , the redshift ( @xmath51  to 2.9 ) below which would be inferred to be predominantly ionized to from the direct observations of the @xmath7  forest ( reimers et al .",
    "1997 ) .    to quantify this ,",
    "distribution functions of / have been formed for complexes with @xmath52 , just below the suspected break , and for @xmath53 , just above it .",
    "the histograms of / values for the 16 systems in the low redshift interval and the 22 systems in the high redshift interval are shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "the median value of @xmath54  at @xmath55  is consistent with that of all the @xmath20  systems , whereas the @xmath56  median value of @xmath57  is consistent with that of all the @xmath5  systems .",
    "moreover , a rank sum test shows that the @xmath58  data are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution as the @xmath59  systems , and the @xmath53  data with being drawn from the same distribution as the @xmath60  systems .",
    "however , the rank sum test shows that the @xmath53  data has a probability of only @xmath61  of being drawn from the same distribution as the @xmath58  data , and that at the 98% confidence level the data require a jump of at least a multiplicative factor of 1.8 from the lower to the higher redshift interval .",
    "the data are therefore consistent with invariant distributions at high and low redshift together with an abrupt jump between @xmath62  and @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding step function , with / changing by a factor of 3.4 at @xmath63 , is shown as the dashed line in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "assuming instead that the evolution of the median ionization ratio is a smooth power law in @xmath64  requires an evolution of the form @xmath65  which is shown as the dotted line in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "this however predicts a jump of only 1.57 between @xmath66  and @xmath67  which , as already noted , is not large enough to reconcile the relative distribution functions of figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "it would therefore seem that simple smooth power law evolution is not consistent with the data .",
    "variations of the ionization ratios in different regions within a complex can result from structure in the internal density of material in the complex , or from the presence of internal ionization sources .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to examine the ionization ratios within the complexes to understand how these effects can contribute to the overall ionization balance and to determine whether or not this can change the conclusions of section 3.2 .",
    "the simplest approach to this is to break down the comlexes into the components determined by voigt profile fitting ( boksenberg 1998 ) . figure  [ fig:6 ] shows the redshift evolution of the / components broken down in this way . all components with",
    "@xmath68  have been included irrespective of the total column density of the complex , so that a small number of high density complexes provide a large number of components , and these also include a number of lyman limit systems in which radiative",
    "transfer effects are significant .",
    "however , even with these effects and with the increased confusion owing to the large spread in components , the change between high and low redshifts is clearly seen .",
    "figure  [ fig:7 ] shows histograms of the distributions above and below @xmath2 .",
    "if the components are considered to be statisticaly independent samples then the median ratio is @xmath69  below @xmath2  and @xmath70  above @xmath71 . at the 98% confidence level ,",
    "the minimum multiplicative increase to bring the distributions into consistency is 1.93 .",
    "however , the methodology of fitting voigt profiles is a very unsatisfactory approach to this problem because of the considerable arbitrariness in the choice of components , which can have several unfortunate effects , including forcing other ions preferentially into or out of a particular component , blending components , and introducing non - independent components .",
    "these problems can be avoided by using the more direct technique of computing the ratios of the optical depths of various ions throughout the complex .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in figures  [ fig:8 ] and [ fig:9 ] .",
    "for each identified complex , all data points lying above some limiting optical depth ( here @xmath72 ) were identified , and optical depths in the corresponding regions of the other ions were then measured .",
    "and optical depths for a complex at @xmath73  in 2000@xmath12330 are shown in figure  [ fig:8 ] .",
    "the ratio ( @xmath74 ) relative to that of then gives the ratio of @xmath75  throughout the velocity range of the complex , as is illustrated in figure  [ fig:9 ] , where it is compared with the average ion ratios in the complex , shown as the solid line .",
    "this procedure can be slightly in error if there is a substantial amount of thermal broadening but should be adequate for these heavier elements where the broadening is primarily kinematic .",
    "/ values determined in this way for all the complexes of table  [ tbl:2 ] is shown in figure  [ fig:10 ] where again a clear evolution of the distribution can be seen .    in order to determine the noise levels associated with this procedure ,",
    "a large number of blank field realizations were constructed , in which the redshift was slightly displaced from the true value .",
    "this monte carlo technique is extremely powerful , providing an unbiased measure of the noise , including the systematic effects of continuum uncertainty , varying s / n among the quasars and within a single quasar spectrum , and contamination by unidentified absorption lines .",
    "indeed , this last - named property allows a robust measure (  4 ) of the average column densities of ions lying in the lyman alpha forest .",
    "the measured distribution ( solid line ) of / is compared with the average of the random realizations ( dashed line ) in figure  15 for all the systems , and also for those above and below @xmath71 .",
    "/ is clearly seen to be much stronger above @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig:12 ] shows median / values as a function of redshift , with errors derived from the distribution of medians in the blank - field realizations .",
    "the data again require a rapid jump at around @xmath2 , with values of @xmath76  below @xmath2  and @xmath77  above .",
    "the local shape of the ionizing flux and the value of the ionization parameter may be estimated from the relative distribution of the ionization levels of the various species .",
    "most work to date has concentrated on using / versus / , which , as we have discussed in the introduction , is a powerful discriminant of the ionization parameter and of the strength of any break near the he@xmath4  edge .",
    "this diagnostic also relies on absorption lines that can be measured outside the forest .",
    "the / versus / method is reconsidered (   4.2 ) in the light of the present larger data set .",
    "however , the optical depth ratio method developed in  3.3 provides a powerful way to measure the average abundances of a number of other species ( , , , and ) that lie primarily within the @xmath7  forest .",
    "we use this technique in  4.3 to determine the ensemble properties of these ions as a function of redshift and to show that they can be fitted into a consistent interpretation of the evolution of the shape of the metagalactic flux .",
    "/ versus / is shown in figure  [ fig:13 ] for the 29 complexes with @xmath78  and for which the line lies longward of the @xmath7  forest .",
    "open squares denote systems with @xmath5and solid squares those with @xmath20 , while downward and/or leftward pointing arrows correspond to systems in which or is not detected , with the point positioned at the @xmath50  level .",
    "the curves show a range of models computed with the cloudy code ( ferland 1993 ) for a power - law ionizing spectrum with a range of breaks at the he@xmath4  edge at 4  rydberg , and with @xmath79 , typical of metal - poor systems . as was found previously in sc , while many of the low redshift systems are consistent with photoionization by a pure power law , most of the high redshift systems have / values which are much too high relative to / for this to be the case .",
    "they are consistent with photoionization by heavily broken power laws with breaks across the he@xmath4  edge in excess of 20 and softness ratios , @xmath80  in excess of 300 .",
    "the models of sc were computed with simple broken power laws and a more extensive discussion of more general spectra may be found in giroux & shull ( 1997 ) .",
    "however , figure  [ fig:14 ] illustrates that the general behaviour is fairly model invariant ; it compares the data with a wide range of power laws ( @xmath81  to @xmath82 ) again computed with @xmath83 . unless si / c is made unreasonably high at @xmath5 , not even the softest power law spectrum ( the top curve ) can approach the high / values .",
    "the introduction of the break at 4  ryd moves the curves to a new asymptote , as is illustrated by the dashed and dotted curves .",
    "both are computed with an ionization parameter of @xmath84  and a @xmath85power law spectrum below 4  ryd , but with a range of break strengths .",
    "the dotted curve corresponds to the same models as in figure  [ fig:13 ] in which the spectrum above the break is extrapolated with the same spectral index as it has below the break but at the lower flux level , as might be the case if there was a substantial galaxy contribution to the ionizing spectrum .",
    "the dashed line is computed instead with a model in which the break is a he@xmath4opacity whose cross section reduces as @xmath86  at higher energies .",
    "this latter model asymptotes to the same / values but requires a larger softness ratio of greater than about 2000 to achieve this .",
    "it is this effect that gave rise to rauch et al.s ( 1997 ) incorrect conclusion that he@xmath4  breaks could not account for the high values of / in high ionization systems since they used a recovering spectrum and an intermediate softness parameter ( a flux reduction of 100 at 4  ryd ) .",
    "however , as the break becomes large , both models reach the same limiting values which are consistent with the observed high values of / and low values of /.",
    "in this asymptotic limit of a large break at the he@xmath4  edge , the / to / ratio approaches a single track characterized essentially uniquely by the ionization parameter , which determines , modulo a very weak dependence on spectral index , the / value . therefore most of both the high and low redshift systems are consistent with a relatively small range of ionization parameter , @xmath87  to @xmath85 , but the higher redshift systems mostly require the high energy spectrum to be blocked above 54  ev whereas at the low redshifts this is not generally the case .",
    "it is perhaps important to emphasise that this effect is not observationally subtle and in figure  19 we show , and profiles for a sample of the high / systems over the redshift range . for the high / systems at low redshift ,",
    "is generally clearly present but many of the high-@xmath21   high / systems are simply missing absorption .",
    "the optical depth technique discussed in section 3 can also be used to determine the average properties of other important ions such as , and whose transitions lie below the wavelength of @xmath7  and for which individual line strengths can not be reliably determined because of forest contamination .",
    "as with , the value of @xmath88  was determined for the ion , @xmath89 , at all positions at which significant absorption was present ( again , @xmath90 ) and a distribution of this quantity was constructed .",
    "a large number of random realizations were then made in which the redshift was slightly displaced , to determine the backgrounds and errors . because of forest contamination , which acts as an effective noise source , the errors are larger than for species that lie outside the forest , such as .",
    "figure  20 shows the distributions of / , / and / for all the available systems , and separately for @xmath91  and @xmath92  systems where the division is possible .",
    "the median and mean values and their @xmath50  errors for a range of ions are given in tables  [ tbl:3 ] and [ tbl:4 ] respectively .",

    ", and are more weakly detected , with a median @xmath94 .",
    "neither nor is significantly detected .",
    "the ionization patterns above and below @xmath2  are summarised in figure  21 which uses the more robust median values .",

    "this quantity is plotted against the ionization potential of the ion .",
    "the primary difference between @xmath20  and @xmath5  remains the much higher abundance of at the higher redshift .",
    "the fractions of the high ions such as and are marginally larger at @xmath20  than at @xmath5 , but the effect is not large . the @xmath20  ionization distribution can be reproduced quite well by a very simple model in which the ionizing spectrum is a @xmath100  power law and @xmath101 ; this is shown as the solid bars in figure  [ fig:17a ] .",
    "this highly oversimplified model is of course only a rough representation of the ensemble average of conditions in the igm .",
    "however , for @xmath5  we need a mix of conditions .",
    "as is discussed above , most of the systems must lie in the regions exposed to highly broken spectra in order to reproduce the lower ion ratios , particularly / , but some fraction of the volume must still be ionized by spectra containing higher energy photons to reproduce the observed , if this is assumed to be produced by photoionization .",
    "a model in which 70% of the systems are irradiated by a fully broken spectrum with @xmath102  below the break and @xmath103 , and 30% of the volume is occupied by a pure @xmath102  spectrum with @xmath104  provides a reasonable representation , as is show by the bars in figure  [ fig:17b ] .",
    "i summarise the results of the paper by noting that , irrespective of the analysis methodology adopted , there is a significant change in the ionization balance of forest metal lines which occurs just below a redshift of 3 . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the ionization balance in the forest lines is fully consistent with a pure power law ionization spectrum with an index of @xmath100but at higher redshifts the high values of / seen in most of the forest clouds despite generally low / values implies that the ionizing flux must be very soft , with a large break at the he@xmath4  edge .",
