    "motivated by the idea that a scale invariant sector could exist above tev energies and could be probed at present or future colliders , it has been proposed  @xcite a scenario where it is possible to calculate the interaction of such a sector with the standard model ( sm ) sector in the low energy limit . in this case , with the help of effective field theory , in particular with banks - zaks fields  @xcite , it is possible to obtain quantitative results . in this limit ,",
    "the scale invariant sector with scale dimension @xmath1 looks like a nonintegral number @xmath1 of invisible particles , named unparticles  @xcite .    from the phenomenological point of view , it is interesting that the low - energy processes involving unparticles can have a particular energy spectrum , that is not predicted by other types of new physics .",
    "there is a rich phenomenology that can be extracted from the unparticle idea and currently there are several constraints on the relevant parameters of unparticle physics using a wide variety of processes : collider phenomenology , flavour physics , top quark physics , higgs physics , supersymmetry , dark matter , etc .",
    "( for a recent review see , e.g. ,  @xcite and also , for more recent works , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , measurements of neutrino elastic scattering off leptons and quarks are becoming more and more precise and provide a sensitive tool to probe neutrino nonstandard interactions ( nsi ) and various kinds of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "for example , new limits on the nonstandard neutrino - electron couplings  @xcite and on the neutrino charge radius  @xcite from all neutrino - electron scattering experiments have been recently derived . as for nuclei the sensitivity of future low energy coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering experiments to nsi",
    "neutrino - quark interactions has also been studied in detail  @xcite .",
    "neutrino data can offer the possibility of studying unparticle phenomenology in two ways : first by effects of virtual unparticles exchanged between fermionic currents , second by the direct production of unparticles . the neutrino - electron and neutrino - nuclei scattering are examples where unparticle effects of the first type are measurable , while single - photon production ( @xmath2 ) at lep is an example of direct production of unparticles .",
    "notice that , beside neutrinos ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 can be any new hypothetical particle , in particular , unparticle stuff . in this case",
    ", neutrino production is the background reaction , because the signatures for detection of unparticles are also the missing energy and momentum .",
    "the recent progress of neutrino physics experiments offers an interesting scenario for studying unparticle physics . in this article",
    "we derive bounds on unparticle physics using both neutrino - electron scattering data coming from reactors , including the interference term between sm amplitude .",
    "we have derived limits from single - photon production in electron - positron collisions .",
    "we have also estimated the sensitivity of upcoming neutrino - nuclei coherent scattering measurements to unparticle physics .",
    "moreover , we have also compared our results with previous works that either used the same processes that we considered or astrophysical phenomena , and discuss the different hypothesis that should be fulfilled for each limit ; in some cases our constraints are better than the previously reported values , and in general they are obtained from a more detailed analysis of the experiments under consideration and , therefore , more robust .",
    "we also have corrected some factors derived in previous works .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : pheno ] we review the unparticle phenomenology and derive all relevant cross sections .",
    "the numerical results are obtained in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally the discussion of the results and our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "at energies above @xmath5 , a hidden sector operator @xmath6 of dimension @xmath7 could couple to the sm operators @xmath8 of dimension @xmath9 via the exchange of heavy particles of mass @xmath10 @xmath11 the hidden sector becomes scale invariant at @xmath5 and then the interactions become of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unparticle operator of scaling dimension @xmath1 in the low energy limit and @xmath14 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "therefore the unparticle sector can appear at low energies in the form of new massless fields coupled very weakly to the sm particles .    in the low energy regime ,",
    "the effective interactions for the scalar and vector unparticle operators with the sm fermion fields are @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 indicating the unparticle scalar field and @xmath19 the vector field .",
    "we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 to denote neutrino flavors ( including flavor changing processes ) and @xmath22 , for electrons , up , and down quarks , respectively .    in the following subsections",
    "we introduce the cross sections that are relevant for our calculations .",
    "it is useful for this purpose to use the definitions : @xmath23 and @xmath24      neutrino - electron scattering in the context of unparticles has already been discussed in the literature  @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we summarize the main cross sections and we also show some differences in our computations with the results already reported in the literature .",
    "the neutrino - electron cross section mediated by the scalar unparticle is given by the expression @xmath25",
    "^ 2}{\\lambda^{(4d-4 ) } } \\frac{2^{(2d-6)}}{\\pi e_\\nu^2}(m_et)^{(2d-3)}(t+2m_e)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the electron recoil energy .",
    "note that this cross section is twice larger than the one derived in ref .",
    "we have neglected terms containing a neutrino mass , since it is much smaller than both the electron mass and the typical energies for the process .",
    "an additional interference term between the sm and the unparticle amplitude should be considered for the case of a flavor conserving scattering ( @xmath27 )  @xcite .",
    "however , for the scalar unparticle case , this term is proportional to the neutrino mass and , therefore , it is negligible  @xcite .    for the case of a neutrino electron scattering mediated by vector unparticles , the differential cross section has the form @xmath28",
    "^ 2}{\\lambda^{(4d-4 ) } } 2^{(2d-5)}(m_e)^{(2d-3)}(t)^{(2d-4 ) } \\left[1 + \\left(1-\\frac{t}{e_\\nu}\\right)^2-\\frac{m_et}{e_\\nu^2}\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] which is 8 times larger than the cross section obtained for the same process in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we would like to comment on the differences between the scalar and the vector unparticle cross sections derived here and in ref .",
    "there is a factor 4 in the vector case due to a typo in eq .",
    "( 12 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite : the factor @xmath29 appearing there should be @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "another factor 2 difference in both cross sections comes from the averaging over initial spins of massive neutrinos  @xcite performed in ref .",
    "here we do not average over the spins of initial neutrinos , because the deviations from the left ( right ) polarizations of initial neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) are highly suppressed by the smallness of neutrino masses .    in the neutrino - electron scattering mediated by the vector",
    "unparticles an additional interference term should be considered for the flavor conserving case , which is given by @xmath31    this interference term for vector unparticles is linearly proportional to the sm couplings and to the unparticle couplings , therefore it can be bigger than the pure unparticle contribution shown in eq .  (",
    "[ cs : e - vector ] ) for some values of the couplings .",
    "note , however , that this term would not appear in the case of flavor changing interactions , @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , neutrino flavor conserving and neutrino flavor changing scatterings are equivalent to the cases with and without the interference term ( [ cs : e - vector - interf ] ) , respectively .",
    "direct production of an unparticle with a single - photon in electron - positron collisions were studied in references  @xcite . in reference  @xcite",
    "there is also a prediction for unparticle detection at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "the differential cross section for the interaction @xmath33 is given by : @xmath34 with @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 being the mandelstam variables .",
    "then the total cross section can be written as : @xmath39^{(d-2)}\\frac{x^2+x^2y^2 + 4(1-x)}{x(1-y^2)}dy \\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the angle between the incident beam and the outgoing photon .",
    "when momentum transfer , @xmath43 , is small comparing with inverse nucleus size , @xmath44 , a coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering can take place  @xcite .",
    "since for most nuclei the typical inverse sizes are in the range from 25 to 150  mev , the condition for full coherence in the neutrino - nuclei scattering is well satisfied for reactor neutrinos and other artificial neutrino sources .",
    "there are currently several experimental proposals that intend to observe for the very first time this process  @xcite , while other experimental setups have also been studied  @xcite .",
    "the potential of some of these experimental proposals for constraining new physics , such as non - standard neutrino interactions  @xcite or a non - zero neutrino magnetic moment  @xcite has already been discussed .    here",
    "we derive the coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering cross section with intermediate scalar unparticles , in analogy with the neutrino - electron scalar unparticle scattering cross section , and we find : @xmath45 ^ 2 ( m_a t)^{(2d-3)}(t+2m_a)\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the recoil energy of the entire nucleus target , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the number of protons and neutrons , respectively , of the detector nucleus target , and @xmath48 the mass number ( @xmath49 ) . as in the neutrino - electron scattering case ,",
