    "in classical data transmission , repeaters are used to amplify the data signals ( bits ) when they become weaker during their propagation through the transmission channel .",
    "in contrast to classical information , the above mechanism is impossible to realize when the transmitted data signals are the carriers of quantum information ( qubits ) . in optical systems , for instance ,",
    "a qubit is typically encoded by means of a single photon which can not be amplified or cloned without destroying quantum information associated with this qubit @xcite .",
    "therefore , the photon has to propagate along the entire length of the transmission channel which , due to photon loss , leads to an exponentially decreasing probability to receive this photon at the end of the channel .    to avoid exponential decay of a photon wave - packet and preserve its quantum coherence ,",
    "the quantum repeater was proposed @xcite .",
    "this repeater contains three building blocks which have to be applied sequentially . with the help of entanglement distribution ,",
    "first , a large set of low - fidelity entangled qubit pairs is generated between all repeater nodes . using entanglement purification , afterwards , high - fidelity entangled pairs are distilled from this large set of low - fidelity entangled pairs by means of local operations performed in each repeater node and classical communication between the nodes @xcite .",
    "entanglement swapping , finally , combines two entangled pairs distributed between the neighboring repeater nodes into one entangled pair , thus , gradually increasing the distance of shared entanglement @xcite .    because of the fragile nature of quantum correlations and inevitable photon loss in an optical fiber , in practice",
    ", it poses a serious challenge to outperform the direct transmission of photons along the fiber . up to now , however , only particular building blocks of an optical quantum repeater have been experimentally demonstrated , for instance , bipartite entanglement purification @xcite , entanglement swapping @xcite , and entanglement distribution @xcite between two neighboring nodes . motivated both by the impressive experimental progress and theoretical advances , various revised and improved implementations of repeaters and their building blocks have been recently proposed @xcite",
    ".    practical and efficient schemes for implementing a quantum repeater are not straightforward .",
    "the two mentioned protocols , entanglement purification and entanglement swapping , in general , require feasible and reliable quantum logic , such as single- and two - qubit logical gates . because of the high complexity and demand of physical resources , entanglement purification is the most challenging part of a quantum repeater .",
    "the conventional purification protocols @xcite , for instance , involve multiple applications of controlled - not gates which assume sophisticated pulse sequences posing thus a serious bottleneck for most physical realizations of qubits @xcite .",
    "+    in our previous papers @xcite , we already suggested a practical scheme to purify dynamically a bipartite entangled state by exploiting solely the evolution of short chains of atoms coupled to high - finesse optical cavities . in the present paper , we make one step further and propose an entire quantum repeater scheme that is realized in the framework of cavity qed and incorporates all three building blocks described above .",
    "in contrast to conventional repeater schemes , we exploit solely the cavity qed evolution and , thus , avoid completely quantum logical gates .",
