    "progress in photon manipulation will lead to the realization of quantum information technologies , which promise to improve acquisition , transmission , and processing of information @xcite . in particular , the development of atom - photon interfaces , which enable us to transfer quantum information coherently between photons and atomic systems @xcite , is important , since photons are suited to long distance transmission of quantum information and atoms are suited to storage and processing .",
    "the elementary processes of the atom - photon interfaces are one - photon absorption and reemission at an atom .",
    "the absorption corresponds to the quantum information transfer from the photon to the atom , and vice versa .",
    "the excited atoms can interact with other atoms to yield a controlled unitary transform .",
    "these successive processes must preserve coherence for high fidelity information transfer .",
    "it is therefore an important issue to study the dynamics of an atom - photon system under the competition between dipole coupling and dephasing .    for the development of atom - photon interfaces",
    ", we have to also pay attention to the temporal stability of the dipole coupling and the re - productivity of a certain coupling strength . in this respect , semiconductor quantum dots , as so - called artificial atoms , have gained increasing interests because they provide design capabilities for the temporal stability and the re - productivity .",
    "though there are many similarities between excitons in quantum dots and atomic systems , such as the discrete level structures which results from three - dimensional confinement of electrons , there are also important differences : coupling of electrons to phonons plays a major role in quantum dots ; in particular , it provides a dephasing mechanism for optically induced coherence on a time scale ( a few picosecond ) much shorter than for radiative interaction ( several hundred picoseconds ) @xcite .",
    "this mechanism will thus reduce the quantum coherence in atom - photon systems and then affect the efficiencies for quantum information transfer .",
    "it is necessary to analyze the response of a exciton to one - photon input under the exciton - phonon coupling .",
    "however there has been no such a theory that treats exciton - phonon interaction in a microscopic model .    in this paper",
    ", we have developed a fully quantum mechanical theory which enable us to analyze the influence of exciton - phonon interaction on the exciton - photon density matrix for one - photon input .",
    "note that , for applications to quantum communication , a single quantum dot is commonly set up in a small cavity in order to achieve efficient coupling with the incoming and the outgoing radiative field at the cavity . in our analysis",
    ", we therefore extend a one - dimensional model developed for atom - cavity systems @xcite in order to treat the exciton - phonon interaction and the coupling to the electromagnetic environment not through the cavity modes .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix of the exciton - photon system for one - photon input pulses is then derived analytically , based on this model .",
    "the expectation values of the longitudinal and transversal components of an excitonic two - level system are formulated for a weak coherent input pulse described by the superposition of vacuum state and one - photon state .",
    "the time - evolution of the transversal and longitudinal components of the two - level system are then calculated quantitatively for a weak coherent gaussian input pulses .",
    "we found that , for a model system of a gaas spherical quantum dot with the radius of 5 * nm * , in which the exciton interacts with bulk phonons , the maximal probability of the excited state can be increased up to 75 % .",
    "this probability can be considered as the efficiency for quantum information transfer from a photon to an exciton .",
    "we will assume a simple two - level model for the electronic degrees of freedom of a qd , consisting of electronic ground state @xmath0 and the lowest - energy electron - hole ( exciton ) state @xmath1 .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the hamiltonian @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are annihilation operators for the light filed @xmath7 and the @xmath8th phonon mode .",
    "the coefficient @xmath9 is the coupling strength between phonon modes and the two - level system .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath10 is obtained from an independent boson model and provides a pure - dephasing .",
    "we assume that off - diagonal electron - phonon interaction coupling @xmath11 to exciton excited states are sufficiently weak .",
    "this assumption is well justified for quantum dots where the energy separation between these states is greater than 20 mev , when the temperature is low enough ( t @xmath12 40 * k * ) .",

    "the light field @xmath7 can only propagate in the positive direction , approaching the atomic system at @xmath32 , and moving away from it at @xmath33 in vacuum .",
    "the dispersion relation describing the field dynamics is given by the wavenumber multiplied by the speed of light @xmath34 .",
    "the factor @xmath35 is the coupling constant between the two - level system and the light field , where @xmath36 is the radiative relaxation rate only due to coupling with the light field @xmath7 .",
    "this situation can be realized experimentally through the use of a one - sided cavity as illustrated in figure [ fig : realization ] .",
    "the left mirror of the cavity has a transmittance much higher than the right mirror , which has nearly 100 % reflectance .",

    "therefore , adiabatic elimination can be applied to the time evolution of the cavity field @xcite .",
    "as the cavity damping rate @xmath39 is much faster than the dipole coupling @xmath40 , the interaction between the two - level system and the outside light field mediated by the cavity field can be expressed by an effective radiative relaxation rate @xmath41 .",
    "the radiative relaxation rate @xmath42 thus describes the dipole damping caused by emissions through the left mirror of the cavity , and the corresponding rate of spontaneous emission through the cavity is equal to @xmath43 .",
    "the field @xmath20 in the theoretical model represents the non - cavity modes .",
    "the coupling of the two - level system with the field @xmath20 is characterized by the radiative relaxation rate due to the coupling with the non - cavity modes .",
    "the rate @xmath27 thus corresponds to the radiative relaxation rate @xmath44 .",
    "although the non - cavity modes are actually not one - dimensional field as described in figure 1 , the representation of the non - cavity modes by the filed @xmath20 is very useful to analyze the influence of the coupling with the non - cavity modes on the atom - cavity system",
    ".    a one - dimensional device will be very useful for the development of atom - photon interfaces since the atom - cavity system can be connected effectively with each other by optical fibers and communicate quantum information mediated by single photons",
    ". the radiative relaxation rate due to the non - cavity modes @xmath44 should be negligible in order to achieve one - dimensional absorption and reemission of single photon .",
    "promising methods will be the use of semiconductor microstructures @xcite or photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "however this problem is not included in the following consideration .",

    "in the situation that the deformation potential coupling is dominant , the time - evolution of the transversal , longitudinal components of the exciton based single two - level system were then analyzed quantitatively for a weak coherent gaussian input pulses .",
    "we found that , for a gaas spherical quantum dot in which the exciton interacts with bulk phonons , the maximal probability of the quantum information transfer from one - photon to the two - level system is 38 % at temperature 0.4 * k*. this probability can be increased up to 75 % in the condition @xmath172 .",
    "since the pure dephasing term does nt become negligible even at temperature t @xmath173 , the maximal probability never reach the probability for @xmath174 .",
    "however , if the radiative relaxation rate @xmath42 is much larger than the pure dephasing term @xmath135 for @xmath175 , the maximal probability could be approximately identical with the probability for @xmath174 : 80 % .",
    "since the transfer efficiency is limited to 80 % , applications of exciton - photon interfaces to quantum information processing should consider such restriction .",
    "our method will provide a powerful tool to examine the performance of the quantum information transfer devices .",
    "in the derivation of the transversal component given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : expecttrans ] ) , we encounter the following term . @xmath176",
    "this equation can be expanded using the following equation @xmath177 as @xmath178 using the commutation relations @xmath179 and @xmath180 ( coefficients @xmath181 and @xmath182 are complex numbers ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deviation ] ) is formulated as a complex function @xmath183 we can then obtain the exponential function with the pure dephasing term @xmath99 by the convolution of the final result of ( [ eq : finalresult ] ) with the thermal distribution @xmath184 .",
