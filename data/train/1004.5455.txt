    "one of the long - standing puzzles in hadron spectroscopy has been the low mass of the first positive parity , @xmath3 , excitation of the nucleon , known as the roper resonance @xmath4(1440 mev ) . in constituent or valence quark models with harmonic oscillator potentials",
    ", the lowest - lying odd parity state naturally occurs below the @xmath5 state ( with principal quantum number @xmath6 )  @xcite whereas , in nature the roper resonance is almost 100 mev below the @xmath7(1535 mev ) state .",
    "similar difficulties in the level orderings appear for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 resonances , which have led to the speculation that the roper resonance may be more appropriately viewed as a hybrid baryon state with explicitly excited glue field configurations  @xcite or as a breathing mode of the ground state  @xcite or states which can be described in terms of meson - baryon dynamics alone  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd is very successful in computing many properties of hadrons from first principles . in particular , in hadron spectroscopy , the ground states of the hadron spectrum are now well understood  @xcite . however , the excited states still prove a significant challenge as they belong to the sub - leading exponential of the two - point correlation function . extracting excited states masses from these sub - leading exponents",
    "is difficult as the correlation functions decay quickly and the signal to noise ratio deteriorates more rapidly . in baryon",
    "spectroscopy , there are many experimentally observed baryon resonances whose physical properties are poorly understood .",

    "@xcite is explored more extensively . in particular , we consider @xmath10 and @xmath11 correlation matrices not only built from the @xmath12 interpolating field , but also incorporating another nucleon interpolator , @xmath13 , to extend the set of basis operators . @xmath10 matrices are built up using @xmath1 and @xmath2 correlators , while the @xmath14 matrices use the @xmath2 correlation functions , as discussed in the text .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to investigate the high - lying positive parity spin-@xmath0 excited states of the nucleon , such as @xmath15(1710 mev ) and @xmath15(2100 mev ) , using larger correlation matrices .",
    "incorporating the @xmath13 interpolator with various numbers of smearing sweeps , enables us to explore more deeply the overlapping of different interpolators with the energy eigen - states .",
    "this will also prove the reliability of the discovery of the roper resonance  @xcite .",

    ", we believe that it is essential to resolve the nucleon spectrum using a wide variety of approaches .",
    "for example , it is now apparent that the consideration of a single level of fermion source smearing is unlikely to be sufficient to resolve the low - lying roper state .",
    "future investigations should explore the role of fermion source smearing in providing a suite of basis operators that span the space in an effective manner .    to test the robustness of the spectrum revealed in this analysis",
    "it will be important for future studies to carefully examine a wide variety of different interpolators in order to test whether or not other low - lying states will appear in the spectrum .",
    "for example , we anticipate that five - quark operators will be essential in accessing the relevant low - lying meson - baryon scattering states .",
