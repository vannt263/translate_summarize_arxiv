    "the objective of this talk is to present a novel approach to a non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum fields @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the jaynes - gibbs maximum entropy principle @xcite , which , in contrast to other approaches in use @xcite , constructs a density matrix @xmath2 directly from the experimental / theoretical initial - time data ( e.g. pressure , density of energy , magnetization , ionization rate , etc . ) .",
    "we illustrate our method on the @xmath0 theory with the @xmath3 internal symmetry in the large @xmath1 limit , provided that the non - equilibrium medium in question is translationally invariant .    to start",
    ", we consider the following definition of expectation value of some dynamical operator @xmath4 : @xmath5 , where the trace is taken with respect to an orthonormal basis of _ physical _ states describing the ensemble at some initial time @xmath6 .",

    "according to the jaynes - gibbs principle , we have to maximize @xmath7 $ ] subject to constrains imposed by the expectation value of certain experimental / theoretical observables : @xmath8 ( x_1,\\ldots)\\rangle = g_i ( x_1,\\ldots),\\quad   i=1,\\ldots n \\ , ,",

    "when the constraint functions @xmath16 are known over some gathering interval @xmath17 the correspondent integration @xmath18 should be present in @xmath2 .",
    "the lagrange multipliers @xmath11 might be eliminated if one solves @xmath19 simultaneous equations : @xmath20 .",
    "the solution can be formally written as @xmath21\\mid_{max}/\\delta g_i$ ] .",
    "in this section we briefly introduce the off - equilibrium dynamical ( or dyson - schwinger ) equations . for simplicity",
    "we illustrate this on a single scalar field @xmath22 coupled to an external source @xmath23 described by the action @xmath24=",
    "s[\\phi]+\\int j\\phi$ ] . associated with this action",
    "we have the functional equation of motion @xcite : @xmath25}{\\delta s\\over\\delta\\phi } \\left[\\phi_{\\alpha } = -i   { \\delta\\over\\delta j } \\right ] z[j]=-j_{\\alpha }      \\ , , \\label{off - equilibrium2}\\ ] ] with @xmath26={\\rm tr}\\{\\rho t_c \\exp ( i\\int_c d^4 x j(x)\\phi ( x)\\}$ ] being the generating functional of green s functions . here",
    "@xmath27 is the keldysh - schwinger contour which runs along the real axis from @xmath15 to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath28 is arbitrary ) and then back to @xmath15 . in ( [ off - equilibrium2 ] ) we have associated with the upper branch of @xmath27 the index @xmath30 and with the lower one the index @xmath31 ( in the text we shall denote the indices @xmath32 by greek letters @xmath33 ) .    let us define the classical field @xmath34 as the expectation value of the field operator in the presence of @xmath23 : i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "defining the generating functional of the connected green s functions as @xmath26=\\exp ( iw[j])$ ] , the two - point green s function is @xmath36 .",
    "eq.([off - equilibrium2 ] ) is the first one of an infinite hierarchy of equations for green functions .",
    "further equations can be obtained from ( [ off - equilibrium2 ] ) by taking successive variations with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "true dynamical equations are then obtained if one substitutes the physical condition @xmath37 into equations obtained .    to reflect the effects of the density matrix in the dyson - schwinger equations",
    "it is necessary to construct the corresponding boundary conditions . using the cyclic property of the trace together with the baker - campbell - hausdorff relation : @xmath38 , ( where @xmath39 and @xmath40 $ ] ) , and setting @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 we obtain the generalized kms conditions : + @xmath44 so namely for the two - point green function we have @xmath45 as an example of the latter relation we can choose the particular situation when @xmath46 , in which case we get the well known kms condition : @xmath47 .",
    "in order to apply our previous results let us consider the @xmath0 theory with the @xmath3 internal symmetry in the large @xmath1 limit ( also the hartree - fock approximation ) .",
    "it is well known that , in this limit only two - point green s functions are relevant @xcite .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations for @xmath48 are automatically truncated and reduce to the kadanoff - baym equations @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the pauli matrix ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 are , respectively , the bare coupling and the bare mass of the theory .",
    "if the system is translationally invariant the fourier transform solves the kadanoff - baym equations and the correspondingfundamental solution reads : @xmath53 where the ( finite ) @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "function @xmath56 must be determined through the generalized kms conditions .",
    "let us now choose the constraint to be used . keeping in mind that we are interested in a system which is invariant under both spatial and temporal translations , we choose the constraint @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , with @xmath59 ( notice that in the large @xmath1 limit the hamiltonian is always quadratic in the fields ) .",
    "the corresponding density matrix then reads @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the lagrange multiplier to be determined .",
    "according to the maximum entropy principle we find that @xmath62 fulfils equation @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the volume of the system .",
    "eq.([off - equilibrium7 ] ) can be interpreted as the density of energy per mode .",
    "similarly as in the case of thermal equilibrium , @xmath65 could be interpreted as  temperature \" with the proviso that different modes have now different  temperatures \" .",
    "the generalised kms conditions in this case are @xmath66 , and so the corresponding @xmath67 reads : @xmath68^{-1}$ ] .",
    "let us now consider a particular system in which @xmath69 . in this case",
    "@xmath70 is the physical parameter which , as we shall see below , can be interpreted as a `` temperature '' parameter .",
    "this particular choice corresponds to a system where the lowest frequency modes depart from equilibrium , while the high energy ones obey the bose - einstein distribution ( typical situation in many non - equilibrium media , e.g. plasma heated up by ultrasound waves , hot fusion or ionosphere ionised by sun ) . in terms of the parameter",
    "@xmath70 the lagrange multiplier may be written as @xmath71 .",
    "notice that when @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and we may see that @xmath67 approaches to the bose - einstein distribution with temperature @xmath70 .",
    "however , when @xmath74 the latter interpretation fails . instead of the parameter @xmath70 , it may be useful to work with the expectation value of @xmath65 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the bessel function of imaginary argument of order @xmath19 .",
    "an interesting feature of eq.([off - equilibrium7a ] ) is that it is actually insensitive to the value of @xmath77 which is important if one wants to use @xmath78 as a `` temperature '' .",
    "the actual behaviour of @xmath79 is depicted in fig.[fig ]    = 6.5 cm    = 6.5 cm    ( 10,7 ) ( 125,25)@xmath80 [ gev ] ( 90,63)@xmath81 $ ] ( 60,25)@xmath77 [ mev ] ( 25,63)@xmath82 [ mev ] ( 105,20)@xmath83 ( 35,20)@xmath84    let us now consider the renormalized expression for the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor @xcite : @xmath85 -i{n g_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta m^2\\over 4 }   \\int { d^dk\\over ( 2\\pi)^d } [ g_{++}(k ) + g(k ) ] \\ , , \\ ] ] with @xmath86 being the usual ( @xmath87 ) causal green function and @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the ( @xmath87 ) renormalized mass . the pressure per particle , in the high  temperature \" expansion ( i.e. for large @xmath70 or small @xmath79 ) for the system described by the density matrix ( [ off - equilibrium6 ] ) may be worked out either in terms of @xmath70 , using the mellin transform technique @xcite : @xmath90 or in terms of @xmath78 using the pad approximation@xcite : @xmath91 it is interesting to compare the previous two results with the high - temperature expansion of the same system in thermal equilibrium @xcite : @xmath92 particularly , the leading `` temperature '' coefficients in the first two expansions approximate to a very good accuracy the usual stefan - boltzmann constant for scalar theory .",
    "the latter vindicates the interpretation of @xmath70 and @xmath78 as temperatures for high energy modes .",
    "the behaviour of both @xmath93 and @xmath94 are shown in fig.[fig ] .",
    "one of the main advantages of the jaynes - gibbs construction is that one starts with constraints imposed by experiment / theory .",
    "the constraints directly determine the density matrix with the least informative content ( the least prejudiced density matrix which is compatible with all information one has about the system ) and consequently the generalized kms conditions for the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "we applied our method on a toy model system ( @xmath95 theory ) , in the translationally invariant medium .",
    "the method presented , however , has a natural potential to be extensible to more general systems .",
    "particularly to media where the translational invariance is lost . as an example we can mention systems which are in local thermal equilibrium . for such systems",
    "it is well known@xcite that equilibrium @xmath96 must be replaced by @xmath97 ( i.e. temperature which slowly varies with position ) .",
    "obviously one may receive this result from the outlined jaynes ",
