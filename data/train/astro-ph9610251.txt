    "] . it should be noted that for @xmath12 the density diverges at the origin as @xmath42 ; therefore the divergence is worse for higher-@xmath1 models . finally , as in paper i , we consider the _ relative _ potential @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the gravitational constant .",

    "for any collisionless stationary system the df @xmath48 depends on the phase - space coordinates only through the isolating integrals of motion admitted by the underlying potential ( _ jeans theorem _ , chandrasekhar 1942 ) , and moreover ,",

    "the tangential components of the velocity dispersion tensor are identical , the only possible difference being between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the total velocity dispersion is @xmath54 .    in the om formulation",
    "the radially anisotropic case is obtained assuming a df depending on @xmath50 and @xmath49 only through the variable @xmath55 defined as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the so - called _ anisotropy radius _ , and where @xmath58 for @xmath59 . under this assumption",

    "the simple relation between energy and angular momentum prescribed by eq .",
    "( 8) allows to express the df as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 ( bt , p.240 ) .",
    "for ease of comparison we will use in the following @xmath64 , and @xmath65^{-1/2}\\times\\dfmt(\\qt)$ ] , where @xmath66 .",
    "the basic requirement for any physically admissible df is its non - negativity over the phase - space accessible to the system , and we call _ consistent _ any model with a nowhere negative @xmath48 . the df obtained by eq .",
    "( 10 ) is not automatically consistent , because the integral inversion does not guarantee its positivity , and so for any model one has to check the consistency : if for some positive value of @xmath55 it results @xmath67 , the adopted anisotropy radius is inconsistent with the assumed density profile .",
    "for example , in paper i it was shown that globally isotropic @xmath0 models are consistent for all the explored values of @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore of interest to investigate here the consistency of the same family of models for various degrees of anisotropy . in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath68 vs. @xmath69 in the case of global isotropy and strong anisotropy .",
    "a common characteristic is that the central divergence of the dfs , present in all globally isotropic models , is unaffected by om anisotropy , a behaviour similar to that analytically discussed in ciotti ( 1996 ) , and for which the same qualitative explanation holds .",
    "this divergence  as for any density profile with total finite mass  is not a problem : although the central phase - space density of the models diverges , the corresponding mass does not .",
    "the requirement of consistency leads to define the critical anisotropy radius for consistency @xmath70 so that for @xmath71 a _ negative _ df for some admissible value of @xmath55 is obtained .",
    "the existence of a critical anisotropy radius for the @xmath0 models is easily understandable , remembering that a _ completely _ radial orbital distribution can not be sustained by density profiles less divergent than @xmath72 ( see , e.g. , ciotti & pellegrini 1992 for an easy proof ) , and that the logarithmic slope for @xmath0 models is @xmath73 for @xmath37 .",
    "it is then interesting to show in detail the effect of a decreasing @xmath74 on the df of @xmath0 models . in particular , in fig .",
    "2 we show the modifications on the de vaucouleurs df . note that approaching @xmath70 the df becomes more and more depressed in the regions corresponding to intermediate values of the parameter @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath75 becomes first negative outside the center .",
    "the dramatic effect of the anisotropy when @xmath74 is near its critical value is apparent in fig .",
    "2 , where we have plotted @xmath75 also for a slightly higher value of @xmath74 .",
    "this behaviour is common to the whole family of the @xmath0 models , and seems to be more a consequence of the om parameterization itself than a characteristic of some specific mass model .    in fig .",
    "3 ( solid line ) @xmath70 is plotted in the parameter space @xmath76 . note how @xmath70 asymptotically decreases towards very small values for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the qualitative trend of @xmath70 is due to the behaviour of @xmath35 : for small @xmath1 this results in a quite flat density distribution , and so only `` high '' values for @xmath74 are permitted ; the opposite is true for high @xmath1 models , for the density becomes more and more similar to a profile @xmath77 , and a stronger radial anisotropy is admitted .",
    "the flattening of the curve @xmath70 for high @xmath1 is explained by the same argument .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , a good fit of @xmath70 as function of @xmath1 is given by : @xmath78 while the exact values are given for integer @xmath1 in table 1 .    . [ tab1 ]",
    "a given density model is not useful for applications on data - modelling if unstable . in paper",
    "i it was shown in a rigorous way that globally isotropic @xmath0 models are stable .",
    "unfortunately for anisotropic models the same approach is not possible , and so only approximate results can be obtained ( unless one performs a much more complex linear stability analysis ) . here , as in carollo ,",
    "de zeeuw , & van der marel ( 1995 , hereafter czm ) , the stability of anisotropic models is investigated in a semi - quantitative way using the radial - orbit instability indicator @xmath79 ( see , e.g. , fridman & polyachenko , 1984 ) , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the tangential and the radial kinetic energies , and have been numerically computed .",
    "this parameter is known to be a robust indicator , i.e. , it is quite independent of the assumed density distribution profile , and when @xmath82 the model is likely to be unstable .",
    "note that for any globally isotropic model @xmath83 , because @xmath84 , while in presence of radial anisotropy @xmath85 , and so @xmath86 .",
    "for the investigated models @xmath87 , and for a fixed @xmath1 it decreases towards unity for increasing @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , according to the previous discussion .",
    "so , assuming a fiducial critical value of @xmath88 for stability , a minimum value for the anisotropy radius @xmath89 is obtained , i.e. , all models with @xmath90 are unstable ( see also point 4 in sect .",
    "6 ) .    in fig .",
    "3 @xmath89 is shown for two different @xmath88 , and the corresponding values are given in tab .",
    "1 . as it is intuitive , for each @xmath1 , @xmath91 : all models in the strip @xmath92 are consistent but unstable . as in the consistency analysis , also for stability an increase of @xmath1 corresponds to a decrease in @xmath89 : this is due to the fact that inside @xmath74 the orbital distribution is nearly isotropic , and with increasing @xmath1 a higher fraction of the mass is contained in the central regions of the model , thus exerting a more efficient stabilizing influence on the system ( polyachenko 1987 ) .",
    "a fit of the minimum anisotropy radius for stability , as a function of @xmath1 , and having assumed as stability requirement that @xmath93 , is @xmath94",
    "in this section we present the spatial and line  of  sight velocity dispersions profiles for the @xmath0 models with radial orbital anisotropy , and we compare them with the analogous globally isotropic cases , fully described in paper i. in order to obtain the radial component @xmath95 , we integrate the jeans equation @xmath96 with the natural boundary condition @xmath97 for @xmath36 . having assumed om anisotropy ,",
    "the integral solution can be written explicitly , as shown by binney & mamon ( 1982 ) , and after normalization @xmath98 .",
    "the tangential velocity dispersion is then obtained from eq .",
    "( 9 ) . in fig .",
    "5 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are shown for some values of @xmath1 , where @xmath101 , is the virial velocity dispersion .",
    "after normalization it results that a very good fit is given by @xmath102    a common feature of all the models is the characteristic central depression of the velocity dispersion profiles : the explanation of this behaviour for isotropic models was qualitatively given by binney ( 1980 ) for the de vaucouleurs law , and analytically for all the @xmath0 models in paper i. we note that with increasing @xmath1 the maximum moves towards smaller and smaller radii ( for the @xmath103 model the maximum is inside @xmath104 ) , and its value becomes correspondingly higher and higher .",
    "the same behaviour is shown also in the strongly _ anisotropic _ models , both in @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "it can be noted how the position and the value of the maximum are not strongly affected by anisotropy .",
    "more important for observational purposes is the line  of  sight ( or projected ) velocity dispersion profile @xmath107 , obtained from @xmath105 as : @xmath108 { \\nu ( r)\\srad^2 ( r)rdr\\over \\sqrt { r^2 - r^2}},\\ ] ] ( see , e.g. , bt , p. 208 ) .    in fig",
    ". 6 @xmath109 corresponding to the same models described in fig .",
    "5 is shown .",
    "note that , as a consequence of projection , the central depression is somewhat reduced but does not completely disappear .",
    "we give here a simple approximation of the position of the maximum and its height , as a function of @xmath1 , in the case of global isotropy : @xmath110 @xmath111 these fitting formulae may be useful when correcting the observed values of the velocity dispersion , in simple applications of the virial theorem .",
    "when observed through an aperture of finite size , the projected velocity dispersion profile is weighted on the brightness profile @xmath5 . as in ciotti",
    "( 1996 ) , we approximate this quantity calculating the _ aperture _ velocity dispersion , defined as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the projected luminosity inside @xmath17 [ eq .",
    "( p3 ) ] . in fig .",
    "7 we plot @xmath114 for the same models of fig .",
    "5 . note how , independently of the anisotropy radius , @xmath115 for @xmath116 : this result can be proved to be true for _ any _ assumed anisotropy ( see , e.g. , ciotti 1994 ) .",
    "looking at our results on the velocity dispersion profiles , we are tempted to discuss qualitatively their implications on the problem of the fp tilt and thickness .",
    "two main considerations can be made .",
    "the first concerns the effect of radial anisotropy as a possible origin of the fp tilt , through a systematic increase of it with galaxy luminosity . from fig .",
    "7 , where the maximum degree of ( om ) anisotropy consistent with stability is considered , it is clear that the radial anisotropy can not produce  in the assumption of structural homology ( i.e. , the same @xmath1 for all galaxies )  the required variation of a factor of 3 in the observed squared velocity dispersion .",
    "this conclusion was already reached for different galaxy models in ciotti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in any case  at least in principle  a possible observational test for the importance of anisotropy would be to construct the fp using @xmath117 measured at large radii , and see whether its tilt is reduced .",
    "the second point concerns the problem of the very small thickness of the fp . from fig .",
    "7 one can see that for increasing @xmath1 the maximum deviation between the isotropic and anisotropic velocity dispersions becomes smaller and smaller : for example , the percentage difference of their squared values for @xmath118 is @xmath119 , for @xmath120 it is already reduced to @xmath121 , and for @xmath103 is less than @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that the anisotropy is not required to be fine - tuned with the galaxy luminosity in order to maintain the small observed fp scatter ( @xmath123 in @xmath124 ; see , ciotti et al .",
    "1996 ) ; on the contrary , all the admissible anisotropies can be present at each luminosity maintaining at the same time the fp thin .",
    "the velocity profile ( vp ) at a certain projected distance from the galaxy center is the distribution of the stars line  of  sight velocities at that point .",
    "it is strictly linked to the line profile in the observed spectrum , that is the convolution of the stellar spectra with a certain vp .",
    "the shape of the vps depends not only on the galactic potential , but also on the stars orbital distribution , a dynamical property not fully determined by the galactic potential itself .",
    "that is why the usual assumption of a gaussian shape for the vps can generate a loss of information , and for this reason it has been suggested that the analysis of the deviations of vps from gaussianity may give important insights on the dynamical structure of a galaxy ( van der marel 1994 ) .    in the case of om",
    "anisotropy the vps can be numerically recovered from the @xmath125 using the integral expression given by czm . as usual , we expand the vps on the gauss - hermite basis : @xmath126 ( gerhard 1993 , van der marel & franx 1993 ) , where the @xmath127 are the hermite polynomials as given in van der marel & franx . the even coefficients @xmath128 measure symmetric deviations from a pure gaussian , while the odd coefficients @xmath129 are identically zero for our models because the df depends only on @xmath49 .",
    "we limit our investigation to the coefficient @xmath130 , because higher order coefficients are usually not available from spectroscopic observations .",
    "the uncertainties in the published data on @xmath130 are of the order of @xmath131 ( czm ) . in practice , we fix @xmath132 , and @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( 20 ) , thus requiring that the first term is the best - fitting gaussian , and we minimize the @xmath134 using the levenberg ",
    "marquardt method ( _ numerical recipes _ , p.678 ) for the simultaneous non linear fit of @xmath135 .    in fig .",
    "8 the radial behaviour of @xmath136 and @xmath130 for various @xmath1 and for isotropic ( left panels ) and anisotropic ( @xmath93 , right panels ) models are shown .    isotropic @xmath0 models have surprisingly gaussian vps , as the smallness of their @xmath130 indicates ( fig",
    "exception is made by the low-@xmath1 models , which present strongly non ",
    "gaussian vps at small radii .",
    "note also how , for @xmath137 the @xmath130 are completely indistinguishable for all @xmath1 and indicate ( slightly ) flat - topped vps ( as generally a negative @xmath130 indicates ) . moving inside ,",
    "the differences between models become more and more important , but the global trend is towards vps more peaked than the best - fitting gaussian , especially for low values of @xmath1 .",
    "the radial behaviour of the corresponding dispersions @xmath136 of the best - fitting gaussian is shown in fig .",
    "8b , where the similarity ( apart a re - scaling ) with the dispersions plotted in fig . 6",
    "is evident .",
    "for anisotropic models the @xmath136 ( fig .",
    "8d ) are very similar to that of the isotropic case , while the situation is quite different for the @xmath130 ( fig .",
    "their values systematically decrease with radius in the inner regions , but rapidly increase at large radii , indicating significantly top  peaked vps .",
    "this general trend , and the values as well , are nearly the same as those found by czm for the @xmath138 models , and are due to the orbital distribution in the outer part of models with om radial anisotropy .    because of the differences in the trend of @xmath130 between the isotropic and the anisotropic cases , and because of the growing evidence that @xmath0-law appropriately describe the surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies ,",
    "we conclude that a detailed study of the vps along the fp could be in principle a tool to study the effect of orbital anisotropy on its tilt and thickness .",
    "the results of this work are the following :    1 .   for om",
    "anisotropic @xmath0 systems the consistency region in the parameter space is explored , and the minimum anisotropy radius that can be assumed for given @xmath1 in order to have a physical model is determined .",
    "we find that models with high @xmath1 can sustain more anisotropy than models with low @xmath1 .",
    "a fit of the critical anisotropy radius for consistency is given .",
    "the maximum anisotropy tolerated by @xmath0 models in order to be stable against radial orbit instability is approximately derived , with the aid of the standard stability parameter @xmath88 . as expected , in this case",
    "the limitation on @xmath74 is stronger than that required by consistency .",
    "again , high-@xmath1 models are more stable than low @xmath1 models .",
    "a fit of the minimum anisotropy radius permitted for stability is given .",
    "3 .   the spatial , projected , and",
    "aperture velocity dispersions are derived for various degrees of anisotropy .",
    "their main characteristic is the fact that the off - center maximum  a feature already known and discussed for globally isotropic @xmath0 models  is still present , and not very much affected even by a strong anisotropy .",
    "4 .   the implications of this work for the problem of the tilt and thickness of the fp of elliptical galaxies are that orbital anisotropy can not be at the origin of the tilt if galaxies are described by the @xmath0 law and characterized by structural homology . at the same time",
    ", the small thickness of the fp at fixed luminosity does not require any fine tuning between anisotropy and luminosity , due to the stability requirement .",
    "we note that the saha ( 1991 , 1992 ) works on stability further strengthen our conclusions : he found that radial orbit instability can affect also models with @xmath88 _ smaller _ than the values suggested by fridman & polyachenko ( 1984 ) and here used , and so a still smaller amount of anisotropy would be permitted .",
    "the vps are studied at various distances from the center for different anisotropy degrees and values of @xmath1 . for globally isotropic models",
    "the vps are very well approximated by a gaussian , except for very small radii and for low @xmath1 , where detectable deviations from a pure gaussian are revealed .",
    "the lower order correction , parameterized by the coefficient @xmath130 , shows that outside @xmath6 the vps are flat  topped and essentially indistinguishable for different values of @xmath1 . on the contrary ,",
    "the vps of anisotropic models at @xmath139 are more centrally peaked than a gaussian , and the values of @xmath130 increase with increasing @xmath1 .",
