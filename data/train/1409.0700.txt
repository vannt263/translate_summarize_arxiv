    "after decades of sustained progress in stellar evolution theory , the connection between different types of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) and their progenitors remains partly unknown .",
    "hydrogen - rich , type ii sne , have been found to arise from red supergiant stars , as expected from evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "conversely , the origin of hydrogen - poor sne ( types ib , ic and iib ) is unclear and one important question is how their progenitors expel the hydrogen envelope .",
    "this process may be regulated by wind , which is expected to be stronger for larger progenitor mass .",
    "however , there is compelling evidence that binarity and , in particular , mass - transfer processes in interacting binaries , must play an important role in the evolution of most massive stars @xcite .    in this context",
    ", characterizing the progenitors of type iib sne , which retain a small fraction of their hydrogen envelopes , becomes particularly relevant .",
    "one of the best - studied objects of this type is sn  1993j , whose progenitor has been identified as a massive binary system composed of a k - type supergiant progenitor plus a b - type supergiant companion @xcite .",
    "more recently , the discovery of the type  iib sn  2011dh in m51 provided the opportunity  with improved observational capability  of identifying yet another progenitor of this relatively uncommon type of core - collapse sne . very early light curves and spectra were interpreted by @xcite , using an analytical representation of the post - shock - breakout cooling , to be indicative of a compact progenitor , possibly a wolf  rayet ( wr ) star . however , through inspection of deep pre - explosion images from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , @xcite and @xcite independently found an object at the sn location that was compatible with an extended yellow supergiant star ( ysg ) , and not with a wr star .",
    "the question arose as to whether this object was the actual progenitor , a companion in a binary system , or an unrelated object in the line of sight .",
    "while @xcite speculated that the actual progenitor was an unseen hot compact star , @xcite suggested the possibility of having a ysg progenitor in a close binary system , similar to the case of sn  1993j . by increasing the mass - loss rates in single stellar evolution models , @xcite was able to produce ysg progenitors of core - collapse sne , although without providing a physical motivation for the modified mass loss .",
    "soon after , @xcite suggested the progenitor must have been a compact star based on early radio observations of the sn .",
    "the latter was subsequently supported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite later questioned the ability of radio data to indicate the actual progenitor size , thus arguing against the necessity of a compact progenitor .    in the meantime",
    ", @xcite performed a more detailed , numerical hydrodynamical modeling of the sn light curve and expansion velocity , and showed that the progenitor could not have been a massive wr star and , very importantly , that it had a radius of @xmath2 @xmath3 , compatible with a ysg star .",
    "bersten et  al .",
    "( and later * ? ? ?",
    "* in greater detail ) presented evolutionary models of close binary systems that naturally provided a complete picture of the progenitor of sn  2011dh .",
    "their calculations were able to simultaneously explain the explosion of a ysg star with a final mass compatible with the result of the hydrodynamical modeling , with a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope , suitable for producing a sn  iib , and with a companion star that would not be detected in the pre - explosion images .",
    "the debate was finally settled by @xcite with new _",
    "hst _ optical imaging of the sn site obtained 21 months after explosion ( this was confirmed by * ? ? ?",
    "* using ground - based images ) .",
    "the new images showed the pre - explosion object had disappeared , thus proving that the ysg star had exploded . at the moment of those observations",
    "the sn ejecta were too bright to determine the presence of the companion star proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is only recently that it is possible to find that last piece of the puzzle that can confirm the binary nature of the progenitor .",
    "observations should be carried out in the uv range to improve the chances of detecting the hot companion .",
    "this letter presents deep near - uv imaging of the site of sn  2011dh obtained with _",
    "hst _ when the sn had an age of about 1161 days .",
    "the observations were used to search for the companion star of the ysg progenitor , and to characterize the properties of the progenitor system .",
    "the site of sn  2011dh was re - observed on 2014 august 7.2 ut with _",
    "hst _ and the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) using the uvis channel and filters f225w and f336w .",
    "the observations were obtained through cycle 21 program go-13426 ( pi : j.  maund ) with which our program go-13433 ( pi : g.  folatelli ) was merged once it was realized that both programs shared the same target , similar science , and similar instrumental setup .",
    "the exposure times were 3772 s in f225w , and 1784 s in f336w . in figure",
    "[ fig : img ] we show the images around the location of the sn . for comparison ,",
    "we show a previous image obtained with wfc3/uvis and filter f555w on 2013 march 2 through program go-13029 ( pi : a.  v. filippenko ) .",
    "this 2013 image clearly shows the fading sn , which was also detected in a f814w - band image obtained simultaneously @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : img ] also shows the pre - explosion f336w - image obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on 2005 november 13 ( go-10501 ; pi : chandar ) , where the progenitor was detected with low signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .",
    "+    a point source is identified at the location of the sn in both 2014 august images @xcite .",
    "we performed image registration of our 2014 f336w image relative to the f555w image from 2013 , using 35 common stars .",
    "the formal rms uncertainty in the geometric transformation was @xmath4 pixel in each direction .",
    "the transformed location of the sn was offset from the blue object by only @xmath5 pixel in each axis .",
    "adding both sources of uncertainty in quadrature , the new object is coincident with the sn to @xmath6 pixel , or 4 mas . at an assumed distance to m51 of @xmath7 mpc (",
    "* from an average of several measurements ) , the new object is within @xmath0@xmath8 pc from the sn position .",
    "we performed point - spread function ( psf ) photometry on the _ hst _ images using the dolphot v2.0 package @xcite .",
    "the resulting vegamag magnitudes for the detected object are @xmath9 mag , and @xmath10 mag .",
    "the object detected in our new _ hst _ images coincides with the sn location , as shown in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we thus tested whether the detected flux could be explained by the fading sn alone , or if it required an additional source .",
    "we estimated the contribution from the sn ejecta at an age of 1161 days based on previous observations of sn  2011dh , and assuming the light - curve decline followed that of sn  1987a at a similar age .",
    "sn  1987a provides the richest available data set of late - time uv observations . even if its early - time evolution was different from that of sn  2011dh , at the phase considered here , it is fair to assume the light curves of both sne are regulated by radioactive decay processes and thus show a similar shape .",
    "we thus assumed there is no strong interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) . in the following we conservatively assumed only galactic extinction of @xmath11 mag for sn  2011dh @xcite , and a total extinction of @xmath12 mag for sn  1987a ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a standard reddening law of @xcite was adopted , with @xmath13 .",
    "the procedure for estimating the uv flux of the sn is depicted in figure  [ fig : lcsextr ] .",
    "we matched the @xmath14-band light curve of sn  1987a from @xcite and @xcite to the latest photometry of sn  2011dh at @xmath0700 days from @xcite .",
    "from this we determined an offset of @xmath15 mag between both sne . assuming the difference in extinction given above , the offset applied in the @xmath16 band was of @xmath17 mag .",
    "we then calculated synthetic photometry in the @xmath16 , @xmath14 , f225w , and f336w bands using the spectra of sn  1987a published by @xcite , after correcting for the difference in reddening .",
    "the synthetic photometry was roughly consistent with the observed @xmath16- and @xmath14-band photometry , which provides confidence for its use to derive f225w and f336w magnitudes .",
    "the spectra of sn  1987a extended until about 800 days after explosion .",
    "there is a final spectrum obtained at about 1050 days , but it is too noisy in the near - uv range to be used here .",
    "we extrapolated the synthetic photometry in f225w and f336w , to the epoch of our _ hst _ observations .",
    "for this purpose , we used a cubic polynomial fit to the @xmath16-band light curve of sn  1987a between 700 and 1500 days , and assumed the f225w and f336w bands followed the same decline rate . with this , the extrapolated magnitudes of the sn ejecta in the _ hst _ bands were @xmath18 mag , and @xmath19 mag .",
    "the uncertainties were estimated based on the extinction uncertainty , and on the variation in ( @xmath16near - uv ) colors among the latest spectra of sn  1987a .",
    "this analysis suggests that in the absence of strong csm interaction , the sn was @xmath0@xmath20 mag and @xmath0@xmath21 mag fainter than the observed object in f225w and f336w , respectively .",
    "the emission from the expanding sn ejecta may be revitalized if it encounters substantial circumstellar material and a shock is produced .",
    "this would cause a flattening of the light curve and it would introduce signatures in the spectrum .",
    "no evidence of strong interaction was seen in the optical light curves or spectra of sn  2011dh at 700 days after explosion @xcite , in x - rays at @xmath0500 days @xcite , or in radio at @xmath0 1000 days ( a.  kamble , private communication ) .",
    "contrary to sn  1993j which showed signs of interaction in this wavelength range as soon as 100 days after explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sn  2011dh appears to be comparatively free of csm @xcite . even if csm interaction strengthened after @xmath01000 days , it would be difficult to explain the observed blue uv color .",
    "spectra of sn  1993j at similar ages @xcite show no strong lines in the range of the f225w filter that could be responsible for the observed color .",
    "an alternative explanation to the observed flux may be an unresolved echo of the sn light reflected in our direction .",
    "any such echo should arise from within @xmath221 pc from the sn . at that distance",
    ", we only expect to find csm created from the pre - sn mass loss , which can be assumed to have too low a density to produce a detectable echo .",
    "in addition , light from the sn should be backward - scattered , which is relatively inefficient in the near - uv @xcite .",
    "it is in principle possible that the observed emission is due to an unrelated source in the line of sight .",
    "however , we consider this unlikely because such an object , presumably an ob type star , should be projected at @xmath23@xmath8 pc from the sn , which leaves a small volume across the disk of the face - on galaxy m51 .      from the analysis in the previous section it is likely that the detected object is the companion of the ysg progenitor of sn  2011dh .",
    "if this is the case , its observed near - uv color and magnitude can be used to characterize the companion star , as shown in figure  [ fig : colmag ] . adopting a galactic extinction only and an average distance of @xmath24 mpc , the absolute magnitudes of the object are @xmath25 mag , and @xmath26 mag .",
    "extinction by dust in m51 is uncertain . @xcite and @xcite used the strength of nai  d lines in the sn spectra to suggest that extinction was low .",
    "however , from color analysis of the stellar population in the vicinity of the sn , @xcite found extinction of @xmath27 mag . assuming the latter value",
    ", the corrected absolute magnitudes would be @xmath28 mag and @xmath29 mag .",
    "the allowed range of absolute magnitudes is roughly compatible with main - sequence , b0b2 type stars .",
    "there is the possibility that additional dust is formed in the sn ejecta , which would introduce extra extinction .",
    "@xcite predict that significant amounts of dust can form in the ejecta of type  iib sne approximately between 300 and 700 days after the explosion , but that the average grain size is smaller than in type ii  p sne .",
    "in addition , uv emission from a putative hot star present within the ejecta can destroy the small dust grains .",
    "dust formation has been suggested for sn  2011dh as early as 150 days @xcite , however it is difficult to quantify the amount of extinction in the near - uv regime .",
    "if present , additional dust would imply an intrinsically more luminous and bluer object than what was derived above .",
    "figure  [ fig : colmag ] also shows the _ hst _ photometry compared with the predictions from the close - binary evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "the suggested progenitor system had zero - age masses of 16 @xmath30 ( the exploding star ) and 10 @xmath30 ( the accreting companion ) , and an initial orbital period of 125 days .",
    "depending on the value of the mass - accretion efficiency parameter , @xmath31 , the model predicted different final masses , luminosities , and temperatures for the companion .",
    "the companion star spectra were adopted from atmosphere models of @xcite with an effective temperature and surface gravity as given by the binary models and were scaled to the distance of m51 .",
    "to this we added an sn contribution using the spectrum of sn  1987a at @xmath0800 days , dereddened , and scaled to the expected at 1161 days as estimated in section  [ sec : ana1 ] ( figure  [ fig : lcsextr ] ) .",
    "the resulting `` sn+companion '' spectra were reddened by galactic extinction and synthetic photometry was computed in f225w and f336w bands .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : colmag ] , the observed object is remarkably compatible with the sn+companion photometry provided the accretion efficiency is low . for comparison , the diagram shows the estimated position of the sn ejecta . assuming additional extinction in the host galaxy of @xmath32 mag ,",
    "the proposed companion star is compatible with the observations for @xmath33 .",
    "this implies a mass range of @xmath34 @xmath30 , for the secondary star at the time of the sn explosion .",
    "note , however , that we expect a certain degree of degeneracy in the models between @xmath31 and the initial mass of the companion , which would require more extensive observations and modeling to disentangle the degeneracy . if @xmath31 is small , one can expect part of the mass lost by the primary to be in the surroundings and to eventually be shocked by the ejecta . in the models of @xcite , however , the mass - transfer rate is high ( @xmath22@xmath35 @xmath30 yr@xmath36 ) only at @xmath22@xmath37 yr before the explosion , so we can assume the ejecta ( expanding at @xmath22@xmath38 km s@xmath36 ) will reach this material ( if expelled at @xmath2210 km s@xmath36 ) not earlier than @xmath22@xmath39 yr .",
    "the predicted sn+companion photometry for the optical _ hst _ observations obtained on 2014 august 10 ( go-13426 ) are @xmath40 mag , @xmath41 mag , and @xmath42 mag .",
    "if there is additional dust formed in the ejecta , the object would be intrinsically brighter , which would imply a larger companion mass , presumably due to a larger accretion efficiency .",
    "we have shown the detection in deep near - uv images obtained with _ hst _ of a blue point source at the location of the type  iib sn  2011dh . the source s photometry is compatible with it being the progenitor companion predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider it unlikely that the observed flux is due to the sn ejecta itself , to a light echo , or to an unrelated object in the line of sight .",
    "sn  2011dh would thus be the second core - collapse sn , after sn  1993j @xcite , to show strong evidence of a binary companion to the progenitor .",
    "if confirmed , the companion of sn  2011dh would already be the dominant source in the optical  uv regime , thus providing a unique opportunity for analyzing its properties .",
    "these observations may provide important clues about the evolutionary paths of massive stars , and the role of binarity in the envelope removal among h - poor sne .",
    "the fact that the two best - studied type  iib sne most probably had binary progenitors is particularly suggestive of a dominant binary channel for this subtype of sne , especially considering the difficulty of single stellar evolution models to produce progenitors that lose most but not all of their h - rich envelopes .",
    "our analysis allowed us to provide a range of valid mass - accretion efficiency @xmath33 for the specific models presented by @xcite .",
    "in general , this quantity is included in the models as a free , unconstrained parameter .",
    "however , a conclusive derivation of the binary model properties would require a more detailed study and further observational data covering a wider wavelength range .",
    "at the same time , such observations may allow us to better determine the degree of interaction between the ejecta and the csm , the possible contamination from a light echo , and the amount of extinction from pre - existing and newly formed dust .",
