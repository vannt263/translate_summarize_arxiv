    "the recent papers @xcite and @xcite witness the current studies on the problem and its generalizations .    our aim is to rephrase the steiner tree problem as an equivalent mass minimization problem by replacing connected sets with 1-currents with coefficients in a more suitable group than @xmath5 , in such a way that solutions of one problem correspond to solutions of the other , and vice - versa .",
    "the use of currents allows to exploit techniques and tools from the calculus of variations and the geometric measure theory .",
    "let us briefly point out a few facts suggesting that classical polyhedral chains with integer coefficients might not be the correct environment for our problem .",
    "first of all , one should make the given points @xmath2 in the steiner problem correspond to some integral polyhedral @xmath6-chain supported on @xmath2 , with suitable multiplicities @xmath7 .",
    "one has to impose that @xmath8 in order that this @xmath6-chain is the boundary of a compactly supported @xmath0-chain . in the example of the equilateral triangle ,",
    "see figure [ fig : sol_steiner ] , the condition @xmath9 forces to break symmetry , leading to the minimizer in figure [ fig : sol_cl_curr_square ] .",
    "the desired solution is instead depicted in figure [ fig : sol_steiner ] . in the second example from figure [ fig : sol_steiner ]",
    ", we get the `` wrong '' non - connected minimizer even though all boundary multiplicities have modulus @xmath0 ; see figure [ fig : sol_cl_curr_square ] .",
    "these examples show that @xmath5 is not the right group of coefficients",
    ". our framework will be that of currents with coefficients in a normed abelian group @xmath10 ( briefly : @xmath10-currents ) , which we will introduce in  [ sec : beginning ] .",
    "currents with coefficients in a group were introduced by w. fleming .",
    "there is a vast literature on the subject : let us mention only the seminal paper @xcite , the work of b. white @xcite , and the more recent papers by t. de pauw and r. hardt @xcite and by l. ambrosio and m. g. katz @xcite .",
    "a closure theorem holds for these flat @xmath10-chains , see @xcite and @xcite .    in  [ sec : steiner ] we recast the steiner problem in terms of a mass minimization problem over currents with coefficients in a discrete group @xmath10 , chosen only on the basis of the number of boundary points . as we already said , this construction provides a way to pass from a mass minimizer to a steiner solution and vice - versa .",
    "this new formulation permits to initiate a study of calibrations as a sufficient condition for minimality ; this is the subject of  [ sec : calibrations ] .",
    "classically a calibration @xmath11 associated with a given oriented @xmath12-submanifold @xmath13 is a unit closed @xmath12-form taking value @xmath0 on the tangent space of @xmath14 .",
    "the existence of a calibration guarantees the minimality of @xmath14 among oriented submanifolds with the same boundary @xmath15 .",

    "it is convenient to view currents as linear functionals on forms , which is not always possible in the usual setting of currents with coefficients in groups .",
    "this motivates the preliminary work in  [ sec : beginning ] , where we embed the group @xmath10 in a normed linear space @xmath18 and we construct the currents with coefficients in @xmath18 in the classical way . in definition",
    "[ def : gen_calib ] , the notion of calibration is slightly weakened in order to include piecewise smooth forms , which appear in examples [ ex : calib_square ] and [ ex : calib_hex_vittone ] , where we exhibit calibrations for the problem on the right of figure [ fig : sol_steiner ] and for the steiner tree problem on the vertices of a regular hexagon plus the center .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that our theory works for the steiner tree problem in @xmath3 and for currents supported in @xmath3 ; we made explicit computations only on @xmath19-dimensional configurations for simplicity reasons .",
    "we conclude  [ sec : calibrations ] with some remarks concerning the use of calibrations in similar contexts , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the existence of a calibration is a sufficient condition for a manifold to be a minimizer ; one could wonder whether this condition is necessary as well . in general , a smooth ( or piecewise smooth , according to definition [ def_compatib_calibration ] )",
    "calibration might not exist ; nevertheless , one can still search for some _ weak _ calibration , for instance a differential form with bounded measurable coefficients . in ",

    "federer @xcite ensures that a weak calibration exists for mass - minimizing normal currents ; the same argument works for mass - minimizing normal currents with coefficients in the normed vector space @xmath18 .",
    "therefore an equivalence principle between minima among normal and rectifiable @xmath0-currents with coefficients in @xmath18 and @xmath10 , respectively , is sufficient to conclude that a calibration exists .",
    "proposition [ thm_minmin_classic ] guarantees that the equivalence between minima holds in the case of classical @xmath0-currents with real coefficients ; hence a weak calibration always exists .",
    "the proof of this result is subject to the validity of a homogeneity property for the candidate minimizer stated in remark [ rmk : homog_cond ] .",
    "example [ ex_casetta_piccola ] shows that for @xmath0-dimensional @xmath10-currents an interesting new phenomenon occurs , since ( at least in a non - euclidean setting ) this homogeneity property might not hold ; the validity of the homogeneity property may be related to the ambient space .",
