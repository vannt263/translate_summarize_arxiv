    "the bulge of our galaxy harbours a large fraction of the known population of accreting compact objects . during one of the regular monitoring observations of that region with the proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) on june 8th , 2008",
    ", a new transient x - ray source was discovered : xte  j1701407 @xcite .",
    "three days later a follow - up observation with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard _ swift _ improved the source localization and showed a spectrum that could be fitted with an absorbed power law of index @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the transient nature , flux level and spectrum of the source are characteristic of x - ray binaries , but the exact class of the binary ( high - mass or low - mass ) was unkown and the compact object ( black hole or neutron star ) remained unidentified for more than one month . on july 17th at 13:29:59 ut the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard _ swift _ detected an x - ray flare at a position consistent with that of xte  j1701407 @xcite .",
    "_ swift _ began slewing to the source 60 seconds after the trigger and the xrt began observing the field 97 seconds after the initial bat trigger , detecting a fading x - ray source at the position of xte  j1701407 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the flare could be caused by a thermonuclear burst based on the early bat data . by studying the evolution of the xrt spectrum",
    ", @xcite found a clear cooling curve and confirmed the speculation that this was a thermonuclear event , identifying the source as an accreting neutron star ( ns ) and the system , in all likelihood , as a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .",
    "as noted by @xcite this particular event , having a total duration of more than 15 minutes , belongs to the rare subclass of long duration bursts @xcite .",
    "after the long x - ray burst the source continued in outburst10 seconds to @xmath2hours . ] and _ rxte _ kept observing it . a refined _ swift_-xrt position @xcite , a search for an ir counterpart @xcite and the discovery of khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were all reported during the following two weeks . on july 27th bat detected another x - ray flare from xte  j1701407 @xcite .",
    "the soft spectrum and duration ( @xmath210  s ) of the flare indicated that this was a type i x - ray burst ( http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/318166/ba/ ) , and hereafter we refer to it as the short burst ( even though from the bat data the total duration is somewhat uncertain ) . at the moment of writing",
    "the source is still active , more than two months after the start of the outburst .    in this letter",
    "we present our analysis of the bursting behaviour of this source .",
    "long bursts are rare , and therefore probe quite unusual burning regimes .",
    "their duration is between that of normal type i x - ray bursts ( durations @xmath4 s , triggered by unstable burning of h / he ) and superbursts ( durations @xmath2 hours , triggered by unstable burning of c ) .",
    "there are two scenarios in which such bursts could occur , both requiring the build - up and ignition of a thick layer of he .",
    "one possibility is that the system is ultracompact , so that it accretes nearly pure he @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is that unstable h burning at low accretion rates builds up he @xcite .",
    "while several examples of the first type are now known ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) , the second class - which probe the boundaries of h burning stability - have so far proved much rarer @xcite . in this letter",
    "we will demonstrate that xte j1701 - 407 is a good candidate for membership of this second class .",
    "we analysed all the 27 pointed _",

    "_ swift _ observed xte  j1701407 again on july 27th , triggered by the bat detection of the short burst ( sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "we also included this xrt observation ( obsid 00318166000 ) in our analysis , which started @xmath2109 seconds after the trigger but did not detect the burst . in the following two sections we provide the details of our analysis .",
    "all errors given in section  [ sec : results ] correspond to the 1  @xmath5 confidence level .",
    "we ran the xrt pipeline ( v. 0.12.0 ) on all the _ swift _ observations .",
    "for the spectral analysis we created exposure maps and ancilliary files and used the latest response matrices ( v011 ) provided by the _",
    "swift_-xrt team .",
    "we grouped the spectra to a minimum of 20 counts per bin , applyied a systematic error of 2.5% @xcite and fitted the 0.5 - 10  kev spectra within xspec ( * ? ? ?",
    "* v. 11 ) . in our fits",
    "( see models below ) we fixed the absorbing column density to the average value found from x - ray fits to the persistent emission : 3.5@xmath6 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "observation 00317205000 started on july 17th , 2008 at 13:31:36.9 ut ( sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) and lasted for a total of about one kilosecond .",
    "all the xrt data were collected in windowed timing ( wt ) mode , except for the initial @xmath28 seconds which were taken in photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "we divided the observation into nine contiguous intervals of increasing length in order to compensate for the flux decay and maintain an approximately constant total number of counts in each interval ( between @xmath21500 and @xmath22500 ) .",
    "about 830 seconds after the start of the observation a data gap of @xmath23300 seconds occurred , after which the xrt continued to observe the source for another @xmath235 seconds .",
    "this last data segment allows us to estimate the persistent flux after the x - ray burst .",
    "we extracted source and background spectra for each interval using circular regions with radii of @xmath230 and @xmath215 pixels , respectively , and fitted the resulting spectra using an absorbed black body model ( reduced @xmath8 between 0.7 and 1.1 ) .",
    "we performed fast fourier transforms on 2s segments of xrt - wt data taken during the long burst in order to search for rapid variability .",
    "for that purpose we used the energy range 0.5 - 10 kev , keeping the original time resolution and thereby sampling the @xmath20.5 - 280  hz frequency range .    both post - burst observations ( 00317205001 and 00318166000 )",
    "allow us to characterize the persistent soft x - ray emission of xte  j1701407 .",
    "for the pc data we used an annular extraction region with radii 10 - 25 pixels in order to account for pile - up . the energy fraction enclosed by",
    "the resulting annuli was about 20% , and such energy loss was taken into account when creating the ancilliary files .",
    "finally , including also the wt data , we fitted the energy spectra with an absorbed power law model ( reduced @xmath8 of 1.1 and 1.2 ) .",
    "we analysed all the pointed _ rxte _ observations of the source made until august 10th . after applying standard filters we extracted energy spectra from standard 2 data collected by pcu2 and corrected them for background using the latest pca background models .",
    "we generated reponse matrices and fitted the spectra within xspec in the 3.0 - 25.0 kev band , after applying a 1% systematic error , with a black body plus power law model corrected for absorption ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : dataswift ] ) .",
    "the resulting fits had reduced @xmath8 between 0.5 and 1.4 ( for 45 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we extracted a hardness ratio ( `` hard colour '' hereafter ) for each observation , defined as the count rate in the 9.7 - 16.0 kev band divided by that in the 6.0 - 9.7 kev band and normalized by that of the crab .",
    "furthermore , we extracted a background and deadtime corrected hexte ( cluster b ) energy spectrum from each observation , but found no significant source emission above 50 kev in any of them .",
    "the overall lightcurve is shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] , together with the evolution of the hard colour .",
    "the outburst shows two peaks at a similar flux , ( 6.2 , 6.8)@xmath9 erg/@xmath1/s .",
    "the bat transient monitor lightcurves indicate that the source was active during the three weeks where no _ rxte _ pointed observations were obtained , at a flux level similar to that measured during the first two weeks of outburst ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the hard colour traces directly the changes in spectral state along the outburst , with a clear tendency : when the source is bright its spectrum is soft whereas the spectrum is harder at the lowest fluxes .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that as is the case for many other ns - lmxbs the correspondence between flux and hardness is not one - to - one @xcite . together with the presence of khz quasi - periodic oscillations @xcite , the peak luminosity and the spectral evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) show that xte  j1701407 is a new member of the atoll source class @xcite .",
    "both x - ray bursts occur at relatively high fluxes ( see table  [ table : bursts ] ) and soft spectra ( low hard colour ) .    by interpolating linearly between the available datapoints we integrate the lightcurve and find a total outburst fluence up until august 10th of 2.6@xmath3 erg/@xmath1 .",
    "more than half of this energy ( 1.6@xmath3 erg/@xmath1 ) was radiated before the long burst occurred , whereas the fluence between long and short bursts was about 5@xmath10 erg/@xmath1 .    from our spectral fits to the post - burst xrt observations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dataswift ] ) we measure 2 - 10  kev fluxes of ( @xmath11 erg/@xmath1/s ( july 17th ) and ( @xmath12 erg/@xmath1/s ( july 27th ) , which are consistent with the fluxes in the same band obtained from the nearest ( within one day ) pca observations . in both cases",
    "the photon index was @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we estimate unabsorbed 1 - 2  kev fluxes of @xmath13 erg/@xmath1/s ( july 17th ) and @xmath14 erg/@xmath1/s ( july 27th ) and add them to the unabsorbed 2 - 50  kev fluxes measured with the pca within one day of the bursts ( @xmath15 erg/@xmath1/s for both bursts ; see fig .  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "these 1 - 50  kev fluxes ( table  [ table : bursts ] ) are the closest we can safely get to the bolometric persistent flux at the times of the bursts , but we note that the uncertainties in the absorbing column density and the extrapolation to the 0.01 - 1  kev energy range could change the bolometric flux by a factor of @xmath22 ( see e.g. discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      from the flux and spectral parameters reported by @xcite we estimate a bolometric unabsorbed peak flux of 8.4@xmath16 erg/@xmath1/s for the long burst .",
    "by assuming that the peak luminosity was equal to or lower than that typical of photospheric expansion type i x - ray bursts ( @xmath23.8@xmath17 erg / s * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can place an upper limit on the distance to the source of 6.1 kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use the eddington limit for a mix of h and he ( @xmath21.6@xmath17 erg / s for a hydrogen fraction x=0.7 ) as a limit for the peak luminosity the upper limit on the distance becomes 4.0 kpc .",
    "the rise time in the bat lightcurve was about 50 seconds , the peak occurred about ten seconds after the trigger ( http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_s/317205/ba/ ) and the total duration , assuming that the burst finished when it reached 1% of the peak flux , was about 21 min .",
    "the fluxes in the post - burst xrt observation , taken more than two hours after the peak of the long burst , are similar to the flux we measure in the last interval ( @xmath21 hour after the peak , sec .",
    "[ sec : dataswift ] ) , confirming that the source had returned to the persistent level .    figure  [ fig : burst ] shows the results of our time - resolved spectroscopy of the tail of the long burst .",
    "the flux decays by almost two orders of magnitude and the temperature decreases from 1.72@xmath180.05  kev to 0.88@xmath180.02  kev during the burst tail ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "xrt did not observe the peak of the burst , and no spectral variations were seen in bat data of that period @xcite",
    ". therefore the question of whether or not the burst showed photospheric radius expansion can not be addressed .",
    "going back to our xrt measurements , the radius of the black body appears to increase between @xmath2200  s and @xmath2500  s after the peak ( fig .",
    "[ fig : burst ] ) .",
    "however , the large error affecting this parameter , the uncertainties on the underlying model ( ns atmosphere in a dramatically - non - steady state ) and the absence of an associated drop in the black body temperature imply that this can not be taken as concrete evidence of a physical increase in emitting area .",
    "we fit the flux decay of the long burst measured by the xrt and find that a simple power law with an index of -1.62@xmath180.04 and normalization ( 3.0@xmath180.6)@xmath19 erg/@xmath1/s gives a remarkably good description of the data ( reduced @xmath8 of 1.2 ; see fig .  [ fig : decay ] ) .",
    "a simple or double exponential decay do not fit the data satisfactorily ( reduced @xmath8 of 22 and 7 , respectively ) .",
    "we note that power law cooling is consistent with the expectations from models for long bursts @xcite .",
    "the bolometric fluence measured by xrt during the long burst , after subtracting the persistent flux level , is 2.2@xmath0 erg/@xmath1 .",
    "we integrate the flux decay along the data gap ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dataswift ] ) and estimate a fluence of 4.4@xmath20 erg/@xmath1 during that period . adding the reported bat fluence @xcite we find a total burst fluence of 3.5@xmath0 erg/@xmath1 , which using the 6.1 kpc upper limit on the distance corresponds to a maximum radiated energy of 1.6@xmath21 erg .",
    "we searched the xrt power spectra obtained during the tail of the long burst ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dataswift ] ) and found no strong pulsations or qpos .",
    "this non - detection is not surprising given i ) the distribution of burst oscillation frequencies @xcite combined with our nyquist frequency ( @xmath2280 hz ) and ii ) the relatively low count rate collected by the xrt : for the maximum rate of @xmath290 c / s , a 3@xmath5 detection of a 2  hz wide qpo in a 2s fft would require a fractional rms of at least @xmath2 25% @xcite , much higher than the values usually measured @xcite .",
    "theoretical modelling of long bursts suggests that they involve the build - up and ignition of a thick layer of he .",
    "one possibility is that the binary is ultracompact , so that the accreted fuel is almost pure he . at low accretion rates , and in the absence of heating from steady h burning , the temperature remains low and ignition can be delayed until a thick layer of he has built up @xcite . although he burning is quick , the cooling time is long because of the thickness of the layer in which the heat is deposited .",
    "long bursts can also be triggered in systems accreting a mix of h and he if the source accretes at low rates , close to the point where h burning stabilises @xcite . in this case",
    "weak h flashes can build up he , which ignites sporadically , resulting in a long burst .",
    "layer thickness again results in a long cooling time : but the presence of h in the burning mix may also prolong nuclear energy generation .    using the measured fluxes @xmath22 from table [ table : bursts ] and the upper limit on the distance @xmath23 that we obtained from the long burst , we infer an upper limit on the global accretion rate @xmath24 of 3.7@xmath9 @xmath25 yr@xmath26 ( for a neutron star mass @xmath27 and radius @xmath28 km ) around the times of the two bursts . assuming isotropy",
    ", this corresponds to an upper limit on the local accretion rate @xmath29 of 1.9@xmath30 g/@xmath1/s , ( 2.5% of the eddington rate for an eddington luminosity of 1.6@xmath17 erg / s ) .",
    "this accretion rate is close to the rate where h burning is expected to transition to stability @xcite , so we need to examine both scenarios for the generation of the long burst .",
    "the bat rise time of the long burst , @xmath31 s , is much longer than most of the pure he bursts examined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this points to it being a mixed h / he type burst , triggered by h ignition , although we note that burst lightcurves can change considerably depending on the energy range where they are observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we next consider the ignition conditions .",
    "the long burst had a total energy output of at most @xmath32 ergs ( 6.1 kpc distance ) .",
    "the corresponding ignition column depth @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the redshift , @xmath35 the neutron star radius and @xmath36 mev / nucleon the nuclear energy release , given an h fraction x at ignition @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath37 ( the redshift for a 1.4 @xmath25 , 10 km radius neutron star ) we derive an ignition depth @xmath38 g/@xmath1 for solar abundances ( x=0.7 ) and @xmath39 g/@xmath1 for pure he ( x=0 ) .",
    "ignition of pure he at this column depth would require a heat flux from the deep crust of @xmath40 2 mev / nucleon at 1% eddington accretion rates ( figure 22 , @xcite ) .",
    "this is higher than the crustal energy release of @xmath2 1.5 mev / nucleon calculated by @xcite , but close to the value of @xmath2 1.9 mev / nucleon recently found by @xcite .",
    "recent results by @xcite demonstrate that even larger amounts of heat may be released in the crust of an accreting neutron star .",
    "however , the high heat requirements certainly put some strong constraints on the pure he accretion scenario . using the maximum local accretion rate calculated above ( 1.9@xmath30 g/@xmath1/s ) , these ignition conditions predict minimum recurrence times @xmath41 of @xmath210 days ( x = 0 ) and @xmath23 days ( x = 0.7 ) .",
    "the data provide only weak constraints on the time without bursts that elapsed before the long burst ( we estimate that the source was in the field of view of bat for about 20% of the two months analysed herein ) , but these numbers are at least compatible with the time since the start of the outburst .",
    ".properties of both type i x - ray bursts detected from xte  j1701407 [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : bursts ]    the presence of a short , weaker burst at similar accretion rates is perhaps the strongest piece of evidence pointing to mixed h / he fuel .",
    "the short burst has a relatively slow rise time , @xmath42 s , similar to that expected for mixed h / he bursts . the fact that it has a lower peak flux than the long burst also implies some h content : if the system were a pure he accretor we would expect both bursts to reach similar peak fluxes since he bursts , whether long or short , are expected to exhibit photospheric radius expansion @xcite . in the h - triggered burst scenario it is possible to have bursts with quite different properties at very similar accretion rates , as h burning transitions to stability @xcite .",
    "xte  j1701407 increases the number of known ns - lmxbs in the interesting low accretion rate bursting regime .",
    "the balance of evidence suggests that it may be a good probe of thermonuclear burning near the boundary of stable h ignition .",
    "however , further observations , in particular better constraints on recurrence times and burst energetics , are required to confirm this picture .",
    "identification of the companion star and determination of the orbital parameters may also be able to confirm whether or not the system is ultracompact .",
