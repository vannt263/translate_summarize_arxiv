    "discussed in this work for spinstars and agb stars , other nucleosynthesis processes have been proposed as possible astrophysical sources of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "the rapid neutron - capture process , or @xmath40-process , is not consistent with the abundance signature of roa 276 .",
    "the low c abundance and enhancements of the light @xmath3-process elements in roa 276 are qualitatively similar to the observed abundance patterns in two halo stars ( hd 122563 and hd 88609 ) and et0097 in the sculptor dwarf galaxy @xcite and are attributed to the weak @xmath40-process @xcite .",
    "the detailed abundance pattern of the neutron - capture elements in roa 276 ( or roa 276 @xmath2 roa 46 ) , however , does not match hd 122563 , hd 88609 , or et0097 .",
    "nucleosynthesis from the intermediate neutron - capture process or @xmath25-process @xcite is also inconsistent with the abundance signature of roa 276 .",
    "while electron - capture supernovae are a potential source of neutron - capture elements , at present electron - capture supernovae models do not efficiently produce elements beyond zr @xcite .",
    "such predictions are not consistent with roa 276 , where a strong production is observed up to mo .",
    "the alpha - rich freeze - out component ejected by high - energy core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) does not seem to be compatible either when considering elemental ratios in the rb - zr region @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in alpha - rich freeze - out conditions , it is difficult to efficiently produce elements heavier than zr @xcite .",
    "different types of neutrino - wind components in ccsne can provide a large scatter of abundance patterns @xcite , and a detailed study should be undertaken to check if there are reasonable stellar conditions that would produce material that would fit the roa276 abundance pattern between cu and mo .",
    "for instance , while high - entropy wind predictions seem to reproduce the observed pattern for sr , y and zr , they underproduce rb @xcite .    in summary , to our knowledge there are no nucleosynthetic sources , other than spinstars , that can match the neutron - capture element pattern in roa 276 .",
    "more complex astrophysical scenarios involving multiple sources could be invoked to explain the abundance pattern of roa 276 .",
    "while this would provide additional freedom to reproduce the observed data , any such scenario might be regarded as contrived and it is not obvious that we would find a combination of sources that could simultaneously fit the neutron - capture element pattern without large overabundances of c and other light elements .",
    "we present a chemical abundance analysis of the red giant roa 276 in @xmath0 cen  and a comparison red giant roa 46 .",
    "the neutron - capture element distribution of roa 276 , relative to roa 46 , can be uniquely fit by nucleosynthesis predictions from a spinstar model with 20 m@xmath1 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath21.8 , and an initial rotation rate 0.4 times the critical value .",
    "roa 276 was originally identified from a sample of 33 red giant branch stars in @xmath0 cen  @xcite . prior to this ,",
    "examination of the sr and ba abundances in 392 main sequence stars in @xmath0 cen  revealed only one object with high sr and low ba @xcite . among the @xmath351000 halo stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 @xmath21 and [ sr / ba ] measurements @xcite , only 13 have [ sr / ba ] @xmath7 + 1.2 and none exhibits the distinctive abundance pattern for the suite of elements from the fe - peak through to pb measured in roa 276 . objects with chemical compositions similar to roa 276 are rare . the predicted [ sr / ba ] ratio from spinstars varies with mass and metallicity , and very high [ sr / ba ] ratios only occur around metallicities [ fe / h ] = @xmath22 to @xmath21 .",
    "roa 276 ( perhaps thanks to its metallicity and environment ) provides a unique stellar laboratory to study neutron - capture nucleosynthesis in spinstars .",
