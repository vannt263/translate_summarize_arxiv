    "we have calculated the total inelastic cross section in dependence of the kinetic energy of the heavy ion ( in the rest frame of the pionium ) for different target ions .",

    "the second term , @xmath124 , contains all high - order contributions , including three - body effects .",
    "this term can be larger than the first term , thus the extraction of the two isospin scattering lengths from an observation of the kaonic hydrogen and kaonic deuterium scattering lengths requires a dedicated analysis .",
    "an accurate determination of the @xmath125 isospin dependent scattering lengths will place strong constraints on low energy @xmath125 dynamics , which in turn constraints the su(3 ) description of chiral symmetry breaking .    crucial information about the nature of chiral symmetry breaking , and to what extent chiral symmetry is broken , is provided by the calculation of the meson - nucleon sigma terms .",

    "the measurement combined a highly efficient stopping arrangement ( cyclotron trap ) and a sophisticated cylindrically bent bragg crystal set - up with newly developed ccd detectors .",
    "the shift was finally determined with an accuracy of better than @xmath127 .",
    "the error in the determination of the width of the ground state level in hydrogen is a factor of almost one order of magnitude worse than the error in the shift value , which inhibits a determination of both isospin separated scattering lengths on the percent level from the pionic hydrogen measurement alone .",
    "the situation can be improved in a combined analysis with the pionic deuterium shift measurement , but then one has to rely on a theoretical understanding of the pionic deuterium system .",
    "a new proposal at psi aims at a direct determination of the width of the ground state of pionic hydrogen on the level of @xmath127 [ 4 ] . in order to achieve this",
    "the experiment should meet several requirements as are a higher number of detected x ",
    "rays and a thorough understanding of the response function of the crystal spectrometer .",
    "most importantly it should also be able to disentagle the strong interaction broadening from other line broadening effects as the doppler effect .",
    "pionic hydrogen atoms may gain kinetic energy by converting binding energy difference into kinetic energy , a process known as coulomb deexcitation .",
    "a recent experimental investigation of this effect took place at psi .",
    "the distortion of neutron time of flight spectra from the charge exchange reaction has been measured in liquid hydrogen and in gas at a pressure of 40 bar ( room temperature ) [ 5 ] .",
    "the measured spectra clearly show the effect of different transition steps converted into kinetic energy .",
    "the statistics problem was solved by stopping more pions in a newly built cyclotron trap and by increasing the efficiency of the crystal spectrometer by using spherically bent crystals as well as bigger ccd detectors . in this way a factor of more than one order of magnitude was gained in count rate .",
    "in addition the peak to background ration as well as the resolution of the spectrometer had been improved .",

    "is presently being set up which produces x ",
    "rays from hydrogen  like ions with high intensity .",
    "their line widths are expected to be an order of magnitude narrower than the expected resolution of the spectrometer . under these circumstances",
    "a detailed measurement of the response function and even an optimization of the crystals will be feasible .",
    "the third problem will be attacked in two steps .",
    "first the 21 and the 31 transitions in pionic hydrogen will be measured at about three different pressures .",
    "the influence of the doppler effect on the line shape will be different for the different transitions and pressures whereas the strong interaction width will remain the same .",

    "in contrast to them they are not broadened by strong interaction , however , and therefore offer a good chance to determine the influence of the doppler effect [ 7 ] .",
    "a further check of the theory of the cascade processes will be carried out by measuring the velocity of the system at the instant of the charge exchange process by the neutron time of flight method .",

    "hence it has been the main aim of many experiments performed in the last years and of others , like dirac at cern and dear at da@xmath106ne , which are running now or planned to start soon .",
    "the nature of the problem ( and mainly the fact that the bound state components momenta are much smaller than their masses ) suggests the use of non relativistic lagrangians .",
    "this approach , adopted in a number of recent publications [ 1 - 2 ] , has proved to be probably the most efficient way to study these systems in quantum field theories . in this connection",
    ", we feel that it is useful to discuss general properties of the non relativistic framework in a detailed and systematic manner .",
    "we refer in particular to the correct matching and regularization of the theory and to the problem of ensuring the uv finiteness of the bound state characteristics and their independence on the the off - shell behaviour of the green functions .",
    "we found it worthwhile to study these problems by using an appropriate model .",
    "our results[3 ] , that will appear soon , have proved the possibility of developing a consistent quantum field theoretical framework for studying bound states with non relativistic lagrangians .",
    "our model has a massive scalar bound in an external coulombic field and interacting with another massless scalar field .",
    "it has the advantage of being exactly solvable and it presents all the essential features of the physical systems one wants to study , without being affected by some inessential complications .",
    "we have studied this model at different levels of complexity .    neglecting , at first stage , the interaction with the massless scalar , one computes the relativistic wave functions and energy levels of the heavy scalar in the external field , by looking for the poles of the fourier transform of the two point function . in a non relativistic framework one",
    "recovers an effective lagrangian starting from the relativistic one and requiring that the s matrix elements are the same in both theories .",
    "then , one can use rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory to evaluate the energy levels.our lagrangian , written as an expansion in inverse powers of the heavy mass , is built in such a way that the non relativistic and relativistic green functions are the same and this guarantees that the correct energy levels are reproduced in the effective theory .",
    "the lagrangians obtained with different techniques give the same s matrix elements on mass shell .",
    "we have shown that they differ only by terms that can be eliminated by using field redefinitions and that do nt contribute to the bound state energies .",
    "we have also verified that , even in the effective theories , the divergences appearing in the bound state calculations can be cancelled , by summing all the contributions of a given order in the coupling constant and using the same counterterms needed to make the green functions finite at the same order .",
    "finally , we have added an interaction term between the heavy scalar field and a dynamical massless scalar and computed at first order in the coupling constant the energy shift ( due to radiative corrections ) for the ground state of the heavy scalar . to perform the non relativistic calculation one has to face the problem of the breaking of the naive power counting rules . in , fact computing the self energy ] in dimensional",
    "regularization one sees that the loop contributions fail to reproduce the expansion in powers of the momenta on the basis of which the effective lagrangian is built .",
    "so one must impose some additional rules , like the so called `` multipole expansion '' that we have adopted , recovering an efficient power counting . with this prescription",
    "we have verified that the non relativistic energy shift at the first order in the coupling constants reproduces exactly the relativistic one .    to summarize , it is possible to develop a completely consistent and well defined formalism , based on the use of non relativistic lagrangians , to study the hadronic atoms .",
    "these techniques already applied successfully to the case of pionium [ 1 - 2 ] could be extended also to the analysis of other exotic atoms ( like @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244,@xmath245 ) .",
