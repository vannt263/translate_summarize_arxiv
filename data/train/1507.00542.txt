    "the most attractive mode - locking technique , due to its simplicity of production and handling , is passive mode - locking , which does not require any external rf modulation source .",
    "however , due to the absence of an external reference clock passively ml lasers exhibit relatively large fluctuations in the temporal positions of pulses compared with a perfectly periodic pulse train @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as pulse timing jitter .",
    "recently , it was proposed to use optical feedback to significantly reduce the timing jitter of passively ml lasers @xcite .",
    "other methods of pulse stream stabilisation which have been investigated include hybrid mode - locking @xcite and optical injection @xcite . to characterize the performance of such devices , with respect to the timing regularity",
    ", the timing jitter is calculated .",
    "experimentally this is done using the von linde method , which involves integrating over the sidebands of the power spectrum of the laser output . however , for the numerical investigation of ml lasers the von linde method can be impractical as it is computationally very expensive . in this paper",
    "we therefore propose a semi - analytical method of calculating the pulse timing jitter for a set of delay differential equations ( ddes ) proposed earlier to describe passive mode - locking in semiconductor lasers @xcite .",
    "the method is of general nature and can be used to estimate the variance of timing fluctuations in a wide range of time periodic dynamical systems described by autonomous systems of ddes subject to weak additive noise .",
    "theoretical analysis of the influence of noise on ml pulses propagating in a laser cavity was first performed by h. haus using a master equation @xcite .",
    "later this technique was extended by taking into account the finite carrier density relaxation rate in semiconductor lasers @xcite .",
    "the master equation has secant - shaped ml pulses as a solution , and a small perturbation of this state can be studied using the linearized equation of motion .",

    "coupled first order differential equations of motion , driven by noise , can be written out . however , due to multiple simplifying assumptions underlying the haus master equation , this approach is not directly applicable to the analysis of semiconductor laser devices .",
    "this is why the theoretical estimation of timing jitter in ml semiconductor lasers has been previously performed using the direct numerical simulations of travelling wave @xcite and delay - differential equation ( dde ) @xcite models . as purely computational approaches are time - consuming , the influence of noise on the dynamics of ml pulses has been studied only in limited parameter regions . in a recent paper @xcite a new semi - analytical method to estimate timing jitter in the dde - model @xcite of a passively ml semiconductor laser",
    "was proposed .",
    "this method was used to study the effect of nonlinear phenomena such as bifurcations and bistability on timing jitter , and the numerical results were found to be in good qualitative agreement with experimental data . in this paper we consider a generalisation of the semi - analytical method to study passively ml lasers with multiple delayed feedback .",

    "the advantage of the proposed method , compared with the von linde technique or the so called long term jitter calculation @xcite , is that it is based on the numerical solution of deterministic equations and therefore requires much shorter computation times .",
    "furthermore , when the spontaneous emission noise is modeled by a gaussian white noise term , the fluctuations of the pulse arrival times behave like a random walk @xcite , making the timing jitter calculated from the semi - analytical method proportional to the rms timing jitter given by the von linde method .",

    "we use the coefficient of proportionality in this relationship as a measure of the timing jitter .    the phase of a solution can be defined in several ways @xcite , which , in practice , lead to equivalent or close results when applied for the evaluation of the phase diffusion rate . in particular , the definition of the asymptotic phase is based on the fact that every solution @xmath45 of the unperturbed system - with @xmath35 converges to a periodic solution @xmath46 in the limit @xmath47 where the constant @xmath42 , called the asymptotic phase , and the angle @xmath43 are specific to the initial state of the solution @xmath45 .",

    "the coefficients of the fokker - planck equation for the joint probability density @xmath63 of the stochastic process are also periodic with respect to time . since , for @xmath40 , the probability density function @xmath63 changes slowly , eqs .   and the corresponding fokker - planck equation can be averaged over the period @xmath36 of the functions @xmath64 , resulting in the diffusion equation with constant coefficients @xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath65 of the time averaged fokker - planck equation approximates the rate of diffusion of the phase @xmath42 ( see appendix ) .",
    "finally , since the pulse timing jitter is usually calculated over a long time interval @xmath66 with @xmath67 and the average period @xmath68 , and is normalized by the number of round - trips @xmath69 , we make the estimate of timing jitter as the product of the diffusion rate by the period @xmath70 this value is approximately equal to the variance of @xmath71 divided by @xmath67 .",

    "[ fig1_1 ] ( a ) ) . for the case of resonant optical feedback , expression for the timing jitter can be further simplified , to ascertain the dependence on the feedback delay length .",
    "this will be shown in the next section where we compare the analytic result with a numerical estimate of the timing jitter .",
    "in this section we compare the timing jitter calculated using eq .   with that obtained from the variance of the pulse timing fluctuations ( long - term timing jitter ) through numerical integration of the stochastic system ( eqs .  - with @xmath73 ) . the latter ( numerical ) method is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we will focus mainly on the case of one feedback cavity , @xmath74 , and compare the two approaches to the timing jitter calculation at different feedback delay times ( @xmath75 ) and the feedback strengths ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "it was shown that after a sufficiently large number of roundtrips @xmath69 within the laser cavity the variance of the pulse timing fluctuations grows linearly with the round - trip number . in the numerical method",
    "the timing fluctuations are therefore calculated over many thousands of cavity roundtrips . in fig .",
    "[ fig1_1 ] ( a ) the timing jitter is plotted as a function of the round trip number @xmath69 .",
    "the initial decrease of the numerically calculated timing fluctuation variance ( green line ) with @xmath69 ( for small @xmath69 ) can be attributed to the impact of the eigenfunctions with @xmath78 ( see appendix ) .",
    "using dde - biftool @xcite , for @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) , one can typically observe that many characteristic exponents @xmath81 of the ml solution have real parts close to @xmath82 , and , therefore , the equation of motion suggests that such exponents will have a non - negligible impact on the numerically calculated timing jitter even after many cavity round - trips .",
