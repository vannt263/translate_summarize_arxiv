    "evidences for the dark matter ( dm ) are provided by many astrophysical observations , although the nature of dm is yet to be uncovered .",
    "the most popular candidates for dm are weak interacting massive particles ( wimp ) , which we shall assume in this work .",
    "dm can be detected either directly or indirectly with the former observing the nucleus recoil as dm interacts with the target nuclei in the detector and the latter detecting final state particles resulting from dm annihilations or decays .",
    "the direct detection is possible because that the dark matter particles constantly bombard the earth as the earth sweeps through the local halos .",
    "as just stated , the direct detection experiments record the nuclei recoil energy of nuclei - wimps scattering . at present",
    ", dama @xcite , cogent @xcite , and cresst @xcite have reported the detection of dm signal with the dm mass @xmath7 ranging from few gev to 50 gev and the spin - independent scattering cross section @xmath8 pb . on the other hand",
    ", xenon100 @xcite only collects 2 events which are consist with the background .",
    "this result then sets the limit @xmath9 pb for @xmath10 gev .",
    "interestingly , recent cdms ii result @xcite reports three signal events which gives a p - value 0.19% ( less than @xmath11 ) .",
    "the corresponding best - fit values of dm parameters are @xmath12 gev and @xmath13 pb . dm can also be detected indirectly by measuring the positron signals from milky way .",
    "pamela observed a rise of the cosmic ray positron fraction for positron energy greater than 10 gev @xcite .",
    "this anomalous enhancement are confirmed by fermi - lat @xcite and the recently released ams02 first result @xcite . in the recent ams02 result ,",
    "this continuous rise on positron fraction is extended up to positron energy @xmath14 350 gev .",
    "such a spectral behavior makes the dm annihilation explanation of the data difficult because it requires a large boost factor for annihilation cross section @xmath15 provided the thermal equilibrium for dm in the early universe is reached with @xmath16 .",
    "for example , several groups @xcite fit the updated galactic positron fraction with ams02 new result included .",
    "they have found that the favored dm parameter region is located at @xmath17 few tev and @xmath18 if dm annihilation channel @xmath19 is responsible for the positron excess .",
    "the favored dm mass range can be lowered to few hundred gev if nearly pulsar sources are considered together with @xmath19 annihilations @xcite .",
    "however the favored values for @xmath15 do not decrease much in such a combined fitting .",
    "it is important to note that dm annihilations in the galactic halo are constrained by fermi - lat gamma ray observations @xcite .",
    "the constraint on @xmath20 is in fact located in the preferred dm parameter region resulting from pamela and ams02 measurements for the same range of @xmath4 .",
    "it has been pointed out some time ago that the preferred dm parameter region by pamela and fermi - lat measurements can be examined through the observation of neutrinos @xcite(see also discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) by icecube detector augmented with deepcore array .",
    "indeed icecube 22 string result on searching for dm annihilations from galactic halo @xcite has set the upper limit for @xmath20 comparable to the required annihilation cross section for explaining pamela and fermi - lat data .",
    "the icecube sensitivity on dm signature from the galactic halo is expected to improve with the data from all 86 strings analyzed .",
    "the analysis of deepcore array data will further enhance the sensitivity in the small @xmath7 regime  @xcite which is of interest due to direct detection results mentioned above .",
    "it is interesting to note that the constraints on dm capture cross section and annihilation cross section @xmath15 can be obtained from the searching for dm annihilations from the earth core .",
    "the detection of dm induced neutrino signature from the earth core has been discussed previously @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the chemical composition of the earth core results in several dm annihilation peaks for @xmath4 ranging from 20 gev to 60 gev .",
    "these peaks do not appear for annihilations inside the sun .",
    "furthermore , dm annihilation rate inside the sun is completely determined by the capture cross section ( dominated by spin dependent component proportional to @xmath21 ) while dm annihilation rate in the earth core depends on both @xmath6 ( contribution proportional to @xmath21 is negligible ) and @xmath15 .",
    "this is understood by the fact that dm density in the former case has already reached equilibrium while dm density in the latter case has not .",
    "hence the search for neutrino signature from the earth core can probe both cross sections .",
    "model - independent sensitivity studies on icecube detection of dm induced neutrino signature from the earth core were reported in @xcite for dm mass around tev . in this work",
    ", we consider an extended dm mass range from few tens of gev to tev . in the low mass range ,",
    "our results can be compared with direct detection results from dama , cogent , cresst - ii and xenon100 mentioned above . in the high mass range around tev , our results can be compared with those from cosmic ray observations by pamela , fermi - lat and ams02 .",
    "we study both muon track events and cascade events induced by neutrinos .",
    "we consider annihilation channels @xmath22 for signature neutrino productions . for non - monochromatic modes ,",
    "we note that @xmath23 produces hardest neutrino spectrum while @xmath24 produces the softest one .",
    "we also include @xmath25 oscillations for lower energy neutrinos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the neutrino flux produced in the earth core by dm annihilations .",
    "the procedure for calculating such a flux is outlined . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the track and shower event rates resulting from dm annihilations in the earth core .",
    "the background event rates from atmospheric neutrino flux are also calculated .",
    "we adopt the effective areas published by icecube observatory for event rate calculations . in section iv , we present icecube / deepcore 5-year sensitivities for detecting dm induced neutrino signature from the earth core .",
    "we first fix the dm mass at two representative values , @xmath26 gev and @xmath27 tev . the icecube / deepcore @xmath28 sensitivity for 5-year data taking",
    "is then presented as a curve on @xmath29 plane .",
    "next , we fix the annihilation cross section @xmath15 at conservative values , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we then present icecube / deepcore sensitivities to spin - independent cross section @xmath6 as a function of @xmath4 for different assumptions on dominant dm annihilation channels .",
    "such sensitivities are then compared with existing constraints from direct detection experiments and that obtained from the icecube / deepcore search of dm annihilations in the sun . finally , we take different experimental bounds on @xmath6 as inputs to obtain different icecube / deepcore sensitivities to dm annihilation cross section on the @xmath32 plane for different annihilation channels .",
    "there are thus three scenarios for the input @xmath6 : ( a ) @xmath6 favored by dama and cresst - ii ; ( b ) @xmath6 bound set by xenon100 ; ( c ) @xmath6 bound set by xenon1 t ( 2017 ) @xcite assuming non - detection .",
    "we particularly compare icecube sensitivity to @xmath20 to the favored range on the same quantity implied by pamela , fermi - lat and ams02 .",
    "we note that neither @xmath33 nor @xmath24 can simultaneously fit well to pamela and ams02 @xcite if either channel is assumed to be dominant .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "to facilitate our discussions , let us define @xmath34 as the energy spectrum of @xmath35 produced per dm annihilation @xmath36 in the earth core .",
    "the differential dm neutrino flux of flavor @xmath37 on the earth surface is then given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dm annihilation rate , @xmath40 is the branching ratio for the dm annihilation channel @xmath36 , @xmath41 is the distance between the source and the detector , and @xmath42 is the neutrino oscillation probability from the source to the detector .    to calculate @xmath43 ,",
    "we employ ` wimpsim ` @xcite with a total of 50000 monte carlo generated events .",
    "although we are particularly interested in icecube / deepcore measurements , the dm neutrino flux from the earth core is the same for all detector locations near the earth surface due to the spherical symmetry .",
    "the oscillation probability @xmath42 is calculated with the best fit neutrino oscillation parameters summarized in table i of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 , and @xmath50 @xmath49 .",
    "the dm annihilation rate @xmath39 can be determined by the following argument .",
    "when the earth sweeps through dm halo , the wimp could collide with matter inside the earth and lose its speed .",
    "if the wimp speed becomes less than its escape velocity , the wimp can be captured by earth s gravitational force and then sinks into the core of earth . after a long peroid of accumulation",
    ", wimps inside the core of earth can begin to annihilate into standard model particles at an appreciable rate . among the annihilation final states , neutrino can be detected by neutrino telescopes .",
    "let @xmath51 be the number of wimps in the earth core at time @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the capture rate and @xmath55 is the evaporation rate .",
    "it has been shown that wimps with masses between @xmath56 gev may evaporate from the earth  @xcite",
    ". since we are interested in the mass range @xmath57 gev , we neglect @xmath55 in our discussions .",
    "the capture rate @xmath54 depends on dm - nuclei elastic scattering cross section which contains spin - dependent component @xmath21 and spin - independent component @xmath6 .",
    "the dm annihilation rate @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "one writes @xmath60 taking into account the quasi - thermal distribution of wimps in the earth core , the annihilation coefficient @xmath61 can be written as @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 for the earth .    by solving @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x2 ] ) , we obtain @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath52 is the age of the macroscopic body , for example @xmath66 gyr for sun and earth , while @xmath67 is the equilibration time scale , @xmath68 .",
    "numerically @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "in such a case @xmath71 so that the dm annihilation rate in the earth core depends only on the capture rate @xmath54 and is independent of the annihilation cross section @xmath15",
    ".    since the heavy nuclei such as iron is abundant in the earth core , the capture cross - section is enhanced due to its quadratic dependence on the nuclei atomic number .",
    "therefore , the corresponding capture rate is given by @xcite @xmath72 with @xmath73 the dm velocity dispersion , @xmath74 the local dm density , and @xmath75 the atomic number of chemical element in the earth core .",
    "@xmath76 is the product of various factors including the mass fraction of element @xmath75 , the gravitational potential for element @xmath75 , kinematic suppression factor , form factor , and a factor of reduced mass .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath76 is not essential for our discussions .",
    "it can be found , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , we like to stress that there are significant astrophysical uncertainties on the dm local density and its velocity distributions involved in @xmath54 @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use approximate formulae given in @xcite , which are adopted by ` darksusy `  @xcite .",
    "neutrino telescope such as icecube detects neutrinos by measuring muon track and cascade events , which are induced by neutrino - nucleon charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) scatterings .",
    "we calculate neutrino event rate according to icecube published neutrino effective area @xmath77 @xcite of the full icecube 86-string detector , where @xmath78 is interaction type for different neutrino flavor @xmath37 . for example",
    ", for muon track events , @xmath37 is ( anti- ) muon neutrino and @xmath78 is ( anti- ) muon neutrino cc interaction . on the other hand , for cascade events",

    "the effective area accounts for the detection efficiency including the neutrino - nucleon interaction probability , the energy loss of muon from its production point to the detector , and the detector trigger , and analysis efficiency .",

    ", we shall use the effective area ( deepcore+icecube trigger ) given by ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "@xcite is only for @xmath90 cc interaction events .",
    "here we also adopt the effective area marked as deepcore+icecube trigger for estimating the @xmath90 event rate . to obtain effective areas for other cascade events , we perform the rescaling @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the averaged fraction of neutrino energy @xmath93 converted into shower energy after a neutrino - nucleon cc or nc interaction .",

    "the factor 0.4 is the visible energy fraction in tau lepton decays , which can be estimated by using pythia @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the final effective area / effective volume for cascade events may be significantly reduced due to the background rejection cut . in a recent icecube 79-string result on atmospheric @xmath90 flux measurement  @xcite ,",
    "the final effective volume for @xmath90 events is much smaller than the one at the deepcore filter level for lower energies while such a difference is within an order of magnitude for @xmath100 gev , as can be seen from fig .  2 of that paper .",
