    "astrophysics has a longstanding interest in the physics of elementary processes in strong magnetic field due to the discovery of neutron stars with field strength of the order of @xmath0  g. even more remarkable are magnetars with surface fields possibly as high as @xmath1  g@xcite .",
    "the fields of these objects are well above the quantum critical magnetic field of @xmath2 ( @xmath3  g for electrons ) , where physical processes are profoundly changed and new processes unique to strong fields dominate .",
    "the production of electron  positron pairs is an important element in pulsar models , because the presence of an electron ",
    "positron plasma is believed to be a necessary condition for the generation of pulsar emission .",
    "the single - photon pair creation process @xmath4 is commonly considered as the main source of pairs , following ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "pair creation can also result from the interaction between two @xmath5-ray photons , created through an inverse compton scattering process by thermal x - ray photons emitted by the surface of the star@xcite .",
    "the attenuation length of a typical gamma - ray for the two - photon process is usually larger than that of one - photon , so that two - photon pair production has traditionally not been considered important in comparison to one - photon production@xcite .",
    "an exception probably is magnetar supercritical field where 1@xmath5 production is strongly supperessed by photon splitting@xcite .",
    "however , these conclusions concerning 2@xmath5 process does not take into account the effect of the strong magnetic field near the neutron star surface .",
    "magnetic field modifies the process , allowing its resonant behavior . at the resonance",
    "the cross section grows significantly and the 2@xmath5 process , in principle , can make noticeable contribution to plasma generation .",
    "it should be noted that nonresonant two - photon pair production was studied in refs .",
    "one - photon and two - photon annigilation in a magnetic field were compared for the nonresonant case in ref .",

    "thus , the detailed study of two - photon pair production in neutron star magnetosphere and its comparison with one - photon process remains topical .",

    "simple estimation shows that moving ions generate magnetic field with magnitude up to @xmath1  g at the moment of maximum approach even for collision energy below coulomb barrier .",
    "the magnetic field effects in the process of pair production in ion collisions have been considered for the first time in refs .",
    "it was concluded that the effect of magnetic field is rather small .",
    "however , it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that collisional magnetic field lifetime can significantly exceed the collision time due to the interaction between the field and the produced pair . since",
    "equivalent photon approximation is generally applicable for relativistic heavy ion collisions , the process could be roughly described by 2@xmath5 pair production in a strong magnetic field@xcite .    in the present work one- and two - photon pair production in a subcritical magnetic field",

    "@xcite , but there is no complete clarity in understanding of this problem . in our opinion , the presence of singularities is associated with neglected emission of soft photons , which always accompanies quantum - electrodynamics processes . this phenomenon is similar to the so - called `` infra - red catastrophe '' .",
