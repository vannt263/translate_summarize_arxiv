    "the effect of magnification bias on the 3d galaxy / quasar correlation function was studied in paper i @xcite .",
    "( galaxy and quasar can be considered synonymous hereafter . ) with the important exception of the classic paper by matsubara @xcite , previous work on how magnification bias modifies clustering observations has largely focused on the 2d angular correlation function @xcite .",
    "the novelty of the 3d correlation function , as emphasized by @xcite and @xcite , is that magnification bias makes it anisotropic . in this paper , we extend our previous analysis by studying the anisotropy in fourier and redshift space . at first sight ,",
    "the extension to fourier space might seem a trivial exercise .",
    "the calculations are indeed straightforward , but as we will see , the results are far from obvious : there are important qualitative differences between the results in fourier space and real space that go beyond the usual wavenumber - position ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) duality .",
    "let us recall the situation in real space , as depicted in paper i. the anisotropy of the observed 3d correlation function can be understood intuitively as follows .",
    "the correlation function is measured by pair counts of galaxies . a pair of galaxies that are aligned along the line - of - sight ( los ) behave differently from a pair oriented transverse to the los . in the former case , the closer galaxy can lens the background one .",
    "the same does not happen in the transverse orientation .",
    "the net effect is an anisotropy in the observed correlation function , induced by gravitational lensing ( or equivalently , magnification bias ; we refer to this effect as magnification distortion ) .",
    "this reasoning suggests the gravitational lensing corrections are largest for a pair of galaxies oriented along the los .",
    "indeed , the corrections can be quite significant : consider for instance a los separation of @xmath2 mpc / h ; the intrinsic galaxy correlation is rather weak on such a large scale , but the lensing induced correction can be quite substantial , since for the los orientation , the relevant lensing impact parameter , i.e. transverse separation , is zero ( keep in mind also that the lensing effect grows with the los separation while the intrinsic galaxy correlation generally drops with separation ) .",
    "in other words , for the los orientation , scales that otherwise would be considered _ linear _ can in fact be secretly affected by nonlinear fluctuations via lensing .",
    "a large separation @xmath3 does not guarantee linearity because nonlinear fluctuations can sneak in through lensing with a small transverse separation @xmath4 .",
    "this peculiar mixing of linear intrinsic galaxy fluctuations with nonlinear lensing fluctuations does not arise in fourier space .",
    "a small net wavenumber @xmath5 is sufficient to guarantee that both the los component @xmath6 and the transverse component @xmath7 are small .",
    "nonlinear lensing corrections can not sneak in as long as one focuses on a small @xmath5 , as is usually done .",
    "this immediately tells us that the anisotropy of the observed galaxy correlation must appear milder in fourier space .",
    "our primary goal here is to quantify this .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the magnification bias induced anisotropy in the observed 3d galaxy correlation has two implications .",
    "first , precision measurements of the galaxy correlation must take into account such magnification distortion .",
    "these include future galaxy surveys that hope to determine the baryon oscillation scale to high accuracy @xcite .",
    "second , the distinctive anisotropy pattern makes it possible in principle to separately measure the galaxy - galaxy , galaxy - magnification _ and _ magnification - magnification correlations .",
    "( the last correlation was generally ignored in previous papers that focused on angular correlation between galaxies at widely separated redshifts @xcite , where the galaxy - magnification correlation dominates . ) achieving such a separation requires that one understands other sources of anisotropy .",
    "we therefore extend our fourier analysis here to incorporate the anisotropy due to both peculiar motions and the alcock - paczynski effect .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in ",

    "wagner et al .",
    "@xcite examined the anisotropy of the 3d correlation that is introduced by light cone effects .",
    "a discussion of the classic paper by matsubara @xcite can be found in paper i. both @xcite and paper i focused on the real / configuration space correlation function , though peculiar motions and the alcock - paczynski effect are also treated in @xcite . a recent paper by zhang & chen @xcite explored the effects of gravitational lensing in fourier space in the context of supernova observations .",

    "the magnification bias correction is given by @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lensing convergence : @xmath16 @xmath17 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath18 is the 2d laplacian in the transverse directions .",

    "the observed correlation function is a sum of all three correlations above ( eq . [ [ gmu ] ] , [ [ mumu ] ] and [ [ gg ] ] ) .",
    "( a discussion of their higher order taylor corrections can be found in appendix b of paper i. ) . viewed in this way , the anisotropy of the lensing induced corrections is quite striking : @xmath50 scales linearly with the line - of - sight ( los ) separation @xmath51 ( i.e. it increases rather than decreases with the separation ! ) , and @xmath52 is independent of the los separation .",
    "the intrinsic galaxy auto - correlation @xmath53 is isotropic and generally decreases with separation .",
    "we can summarize the distinctive lensing induced anisotropy in the observed correlation function as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the los and transverse separations respectively , @xmath57 represents the galaxy - magnification correlation and @xmath58 represents the magnification - magnification correlation . here ,",

    "the presence of @xmath128 and @xmath93 means that the effects of magnification bias are largest for low @xmath6 s .",
    "the simplest limit to consider is the one with @xmath129 ( i.e. a @xmath130 vector that is oriented _ transverse _ to the los ) in which case the factors of @xmath47 cancel out in the ratios , since @xmath131 . in the small @xmath6 limit , @xmath132 and @xmath110 , where @xmath83 is the width of the redshift bin over which one is measuring the power spectrum .",

    "nonetheless , it is perhaps a little surprising that magnification bias appears to have a much more modest effect on the observed clustering in fourier space compared to real space , where the corresponding ratios @xmath63 and @xmath145 can reach order unity or even higher in the los orientation ( eq . [ [ xiorder ] ] ; see paper i for details ) . the fundamental reason is the absence in fourier space of this potentially large boost factor , @xmath146 in eq .",
    "( [ xiorder ] ) , that is present for the correlation function .",
    "consider a separation vector @xmath147 that is oriented along the los , which is the orientation that maximizes the magnification bias effect . if @xmath148 is sufficiently large , the galaxy - galaxy correlation @xmath53 is essentially determined by the power spectrum in the linear regime ( low @xmath149 in eq .",
    "[ [ xiorder ] ] ) and is quite weak , while the galaxy - magnification correlation @xmath77 and the magnification - magnification correlation @xmath52 are sensitive to the power in the nonlinear regime ( high @xmath150 in eq .",
    "[ [ xiorder ] ] ) and can be appreciable . in other words , in the los orientation in real space , one is comparing intrinsic galaxy fluctuations and lensing fluctuations on very different scales .",
    "consider , on the other hand , a vector @xmath130 that points in the transverse direction , which is the fourier analog of a los @xmath151 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath131 and factors of the mass power spectrum simply cancel out of the ratios in eq .",
    "( [ porder ] ) .",
    "there is no boost coming from a ratio of powers on very different scales , as in the case of the correlation function . _ in other words , the mixing of magnification bias corrections with the intrinsic galaxy clustering term occurs in a very different manner in fourier space than in real space .",
    "_    ultimately , the correlation function and the power spectrum are related by fourier transform , and so should really contain the same information . the important point to keep in mind ,",
    "however , is that for cosmological purposes , one often focuses on scales that are perceived to be linear : in the case of the correlation function , that means a large @xmath148 , and in the case of the power spectrum , that means a small @xmath5 . with the presence of magnification bias , a large @xmath148 no longer protects one against nonlinearity i.e. a separation @xmath147 pointing along the los ( i.e. small @xmath4 ) is subject to large magnification corrections even if @xmath148 is large . on the other hand ,",
    "a small @xmath5 means both @xmath6 and @xmath7 must be small , which protects one against nonlinear fluctuations .",
    "let us return to the order of magnitude estimates in eq .",
    "( [ porder ] ) , to see what happens if one considers angular averages .",

    "note how the width of the window @xmath120 completely disappears from this ratio .",
    "a similar expression holds for the tophat case as well .",
    "this ratio is small for @xmath159 , unless one goes to a sufficiently high redshift .",
    "the corresponding ratio for galaxy - magnification can not be worked out analytically because the window @xmath93 has a more complicated form . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "one expects this ratio to scale with @xmath120 . in practice",
    ", we find that for redshifts where magnification bias matters , the monopole of the galaxy - magnification power spectrum is quite a bit smaller than that of the magnification - magnification power spectrum , in part because of cancellations that occur under the angular average .",
    "the intuition gained above from the order of magnitude estimates ( eq . [ [ porder ] ] , [ [ pmonopoleratio ] ] ) is confirmed by the exact numerical evaluation of @xmath106 , @xmath104 and @xmath49 according to eq .",

    "there is the interesting question of how magnification bias impacts baryon oscillation measurements .",
    "this was addressed in paper i for the real space correlation function . _ briefly summarizing : we found that the observed baryon acoustic scale can be shifted by up to @xmath164 in the los orientation , and up to @xmath165 in the monopole , depending on the exact values of the galaxy bias , redshift and number count slope .",
    "the corresponding shifts in the inferred hubble parameter and angular diameter distance , if ignored , could significantly bias measurements of the dark energy equation of state ( by up to @xmath166 ) . _ in fourier space , there are several wiggles , and the magnification bias induced shift in the baryon oscillation scale is likely more sensitive to exactly how this scale is extracted from data .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to investigate this further in this paper .",
    "given the earlier discussions , it is reasonable to expect that baryon acoustic oscillation measurements are less affected by magnification bias in fourier space .",

    "the question is whether , in fitting the observed data for the baryon oscillation scale , one should introduce additional fit parameters to account for magnification bias , and what impact they might have on the measurement accuracy of the hubble parameter and the angular diameter distance .",

    "[ pkall.z.3.0.2 ] , the kaiser distortion dominates over the finger - of - god effect due to virialized motions : the contours of constant @xmath204 are elongated in the los direction for @xmath0 s larger than the radiation - matter equality scale , and compressed otherwise .",
    "it is also worth noting that magnification distortion survives the kaiser distortion .",
    "the two kinds of distortions have fundamentally different shapes .",
    "magnification distortion is localized to small @xmath6 s , whereas the kaiser distortion is more spread out .",
    "the localized nature of magnification distortion originates from the fact that the corrections it introduces ( the second and third terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ [ approx ] ] ) are proportional to the multiplicative windows @xmath107 and @xmath205 , both of which peak at small @xmath6 s .",
    "interestingly , the kaiser distortion vanishes at @xmath206 , exactly where magnification bias has the largest effect .",
    "this suggests it should be possible to disentangle the two different distortions from data .",
    "for instance , the one free parameter that controls the kaiser distortion , @xmath207 , can be determined from the observed power spectrum anisotropy by excluding from consideration the small @xmath6 modes . with this in hand",
    ", one should be able to predict the dotted contours such as those in fig .",
    "[ pkall.z.3.0.2]a .",
    "the difference between the observed ( solid ) contours and the dotted ones then gives us the magnification bias corrections .",
    "the galaxy - magnification and magnification - magnification contributions can be further separated from each other by using the distinctive shapes of their respective multiplicative windows @xmath93 and @xmath208 ( for instance , the latter is positive definite whereas the former can go negative ; see fig .",
    "[ gwinoutt ] ) .    fig .",
    "[ pkall.z.2 ] is analogous to fig .",
    "[ pkall.z.3.0.2 ] except that @xmath194 is increased to @xmath209 mpc / h , corresponding to a velocity dispersion of @xmath210 km / s , or a redshift dispersion of @xmath211 .",
    "this larger value for @xmath194 is chosen to mimic the effect of photometric redshifts .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath201 mpc / h , one can clearly see here a finger - of - god effect of sorts : the contours of constant @xmath204 are compressed in the los direction , for sufficiently large @xmath0 s . as before ,",
    "magnification distortion is clearly visible , being well localized to small @xmath6 s .",
    "its distinctive shape makes it in principle distinguishable from both the kaiser distortion and the finger - of - god effect , which are more spread out on the @xmath212 plane .",
    "it is also worth noting that in cases where the power spectrum is strongly anisotropic , such as in fig .",
    "[ pkall.z.2 ] , the monopole is probably not the most relevant quantity to consider .",
    "this is because some orientations are much more noisy than the others , and one might not want to weigh them equally ( or more precisely , according to eq . [ [ monopolep ] ] ) . in general , with sufficient redshift accuracy , one should make use of the full 3d information available . in this vein , it is not uncommon to consider higher multipoles of the anisotropic power spectrum @xcite .",
    "this is especially useful for analyzing the kaiser distortion since it gives rise to only 2 extra multipoles .",
    "however , a multipole expansion is likely not helpful in analyzing magnification distortion , due to its localized nature .",
    "it is probably more useful to take advantage of the special dependence on @xmath107 and @xmath208 of the galaxy - magnification and magnification - magnification terms ( eq . [ [ approx ] ] ) .",
    "how to optimally extract these two contributions from noisy data deserves further study .",
    "in addition to redshift distortion due to peculiar motions , another well known effect is the so called cosmological distortion , or alcock - paczynski effect @xcite .",
    "this is taken up in appendix [ app : ap ] .",
    "in paper i , we examined the effects of magnification distortion in real / configuration space , and here we have extended the analysis to fourier and redshift space .",
    "the observed galaxy / quasar correlation is endowed with a distinctive lensing induced anisotropy .",
    "this is encapsulated in eq .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) for real space and eq .",
    "( [ pgmu ] ) , ( [ pmumu ] ) , ( [ pgg ] ) and ( [ pobs ] ) for fourier space : the linear dependence on the los separation @xmath55 in the real space galaxy - magnification correlation gives rise to the multiplicative window @xmath93 in the galaxy - magnification power spectrum .",
    "likewise , the independence of the real space magnification - magnification correlation on @xmath55 accounts for the appearance of the multiplicative window @xmath105 in the magnification - magnification power spectrum .",
    "qualitatively , the galaxy correlation becomes enhanced for the transverse modes in fourier space , and for pairs oriented along the los in real space .",
    "quantitatively , the degree of enhancement is rather different for the dual spaces . as explained in  [ intro ] and  [ pk ] , magnification distortion is less severe in fourier space : as long as one focuses on modes with a small wavenumber @xmath0 , as is usually done when obtaining cosmological constraints , both the intrinsic galaxy fluctuations and the lensing fluctuations are in the linear regime . in real space , even if the pair separation is large , one can not help but mix up linear intrinsic galaxy fluctuations with nonlinear lensing fluctuations , as long as one considers the los orientation .",
    "incidentally , this implies that a linear galaxy bias is a better approximation in fourier space than in real space .",
    "the above findings suggest that in precision measurements of the galaxy power spectrum , such as those that attempt to use the baryon oscillation scale to constrain dark energy @xcite , the simplest way to immunize against magnification bias could be to go to fourier space , and remove from consideration the small @xmath6 ( transverse ) modes where magnification bias has the largest effect .",
    "however , in a photometric redshift survey , these are probably the modes with the highest signal - to - noise , and the fourier space also suffers from possible complications due to a non - poissonian shot noise @xcite .",
    "a better strategy is perhaps to face the magnification bias corrections head on , and use the full 3d information to constrain and measure them ",
    "after all , they contain interesting cosmological information too .",
    "precisely how magnification bias corrections might shift the baryon oscillation scale is a subject worthy of a separate paper .",
    "the precise shift will depend on exactly how the oscillation scale is extracted from data . a preliminary investigation in real space , where the acoustic oscillations manifest as a single local maximum whose position is easily defined ,",
    "was presented in paper i : as discussed at the end of  [ pk ] , the impact on measurements of the dark energy equation of state can be significant ( shifting it by up to @xmath166 ) .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the baryon oscillations are not the only large scale features of interest .",
