    "most of the stars in the galaxies are the main sequence stars which evolve by burning lighter elements into heavier nuclei .",
    "stars massive than @xmath4 explode into supernova leaving the core behind which then collapses to form a compact object .",
    "the cores are supported by the degenerate pressure of its constituent particles and possess the densities of the relativistic scales i.e. @xmath5 ( which is the schwarzschild radius of the star ) where @xmath6 is the mass and @xmath7 is radius of the compact object . at these densities ,",
    "relativistic effects dominate and the physical quantities like gradients of pressure and mass are determined by the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations for an isotropic and homogeneous compact star . in these stars ,",
    "the matter is found in stable ground state where the quarks are confined inside the hadrons .",
    "it is suggested that the quarks if de - confined into individual @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks can also yield a stable ground state of matter , which is called ` strange matter ' @xcite .",
    "stars composed of mostly strange matter are therefore termed as ` strange stars ' @xcite ( see @xcite for review on this topic ) .",
    "generally , superdense stars with mass to size ratio exceeding 0.3 are expected to be composed of strange matter @xcite .",
    "the prime motivation for the existence of strange stars was to explain the exotic phenomena of gamma ray bursts and soft gamma ray repeaters @xcite .",
    "now with the observations of the rossi x - ray timing explorer , it is convincingly shown that astrophysical source sax j1808.4 - 3658 is more likely a strange star @xcite .",
    "the transition from the normal hadronic to the strange matter occurs at sufficiently high densities or corresponding low temperatures as @xmath11 .",
    "these conditions can mostly be found inside the cores of fast rotating pulsars , p - stars ( composed of @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks and are in @xmath12 equilibrium with electrons ) or magnetic field powered magnetars .",
    "the density distribution inside these stars need not be isotropic and homogeneous ( as proposed in the tov model ) if strange matter truly exists , then stars composed of entirely strange matter can also be found .",
    "recently several authors have studied compact stars with anisotropic matter distribution @xcite .",
    "we provide star models admitting conformal motion with different anisotropy .    to search the natural relation between geometry and matter through the einstein s equations , it is useful to use inheritance symmetry .",
    "the well known inheritance symmetry is the symmetry under conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) i.e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the lie derivative operator , @xmath15 is the four vector along which the derivative is taken and @xmath16 is the conformal killing vector . note that if @xmath17 then eq . ( 1 ) gives the killing vector , if @xmath18 it gives homothetic vector and if @xmath19 then it yields conformal vectors .",
    "thus ckv provides a deeper insight into the spacetime geometry . moreover , if the conformal factor @xmath17 , it implies that the underlying spacetime is conformally flat which further implies that the weyl tensor also vanishes .",
    "these conformally flat spacetimes represent gravitational fields without the source of matter producing these fields .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the second section , we model our gravitational system and formulate the field equations .",

    "unless one knows the exact form of @xmath35 , one could not say any things ( i.e. all the physical properties of the anisotropic fluid ) .",
    "our model is new and interesting in the sense that we are the first authors who consider anisotropic stars with different form of anisotropy admitting conformal motion .",

    "we observe that the radial and transverse pressures gradually decrease as @xmath7 approaches to the surface @xmath79 .",
    "this result is consistent with our boundary condition of vanishing pressures all at the stellar surface .",
    "it comes as no surprise that the pressure and the mass profile of the compact stars is all along similar to the normal hydrogen burning stars .",

    "the mass parameter @xmath75 is steeper in the second case then the first one .",

    "the density profile in the first case goes to zero while it remains constant in the second case in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath7 .",
    "+ one can note that any static spherically symmetric space time admitting conformal motion suffers @xmath51 singularity . in our model",

    "so , the models ( case - i and case - ii ) are physically acceptable .",
    "in addition to this , one can find that the matter density and fluid pressure are non negative and gradient @xmath87 is decreasing with r. thus our models ( i.e. interior solutions of the gravitational field equations ) are fully physically meaningful .",
    "as our models suffer @xmath51 singularity , the minimum value of r is taken to be a positive quantity ( km ) . since radius of the star",
    "is taken to 10 km ( this is justified as the radius of some of the observed strange stars are nearly equal to 10 km ) , so one can note that the total mass of the star is m ( r=10 ) .",

    "+ in our current analysis , we have used an idealization of spherical symmetry , stationary and static compact star . in general , from the astrophysical point of view , most of the observed or predicted compact star candidates are no longer static but rotating about a unique axis that may be oblique from the magnetic axis of the star . more exotic stars including magnetars ( driven by mostly magnetic fields ) and pulsars ( mostly driven by higher angular momentum ) are well known examples of rotating compact stars . in our forth coming work , we plan to work out a similar analysis presented here for the fast rotating or ultra - fast rotating compact stars",
