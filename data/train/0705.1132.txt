    "models with similar total optical depth but different ionization histories can produce markedly different predictions for the @xmath0-mode power spectrum . in an instantaneous reionization scenario , the contribution to the optical depth from @xmath4 is concentrated at the lowest redshifts possible for a given @xmath2 , and the @xmath0-mode power spectrum for such a model is sharply peaked on large scales , at @xmath11 .",
    "the main effect of shifting some portion of the reionization history to higher redshifts while keeping @xmath2 fixed is to reduce the @xmath0-mode power on the largest scales and increase it on smaller scales .",
    "this redistribution of power is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cl ] by the ionization histories and @xmath6 for two models , one with nearly instantaneous reionization and the other with comparable optical depth but with @xmath4 concentrated at higher @xmath12 .",
    "in general , a flatter large - scale @xmath0-mode spectrum with power extending out to @xmath13 - 20 is a sign of a large ionized fraction at high redshift .",
    "however , there is not a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath5 and @xmath12 ; the ionized fraction within any particular narrow redshift bin affects @xmath6 over a wide range of angular scales . ionized fractions in adjacent redshift bins",

    "the noise level and other characteristics of an experiment can be included in the construction of the eigenfunctions , but since the effect on @xmath37 is small we always use the noise - free eigenfunctions here .",
    "the eigenfunctions satisfy the orthogonality and completeness relations @xmath38 the normalization of @xmath37 is chosen so that the eigenfunctions are independent of bin width as @xmath39 . in equation ( [ eq : orthog1 ] ) and elsewhere in this paper where there are sums over redshift",
    ", we assume the continuous limit , replacing @xmath40 by @xmath41 .",
    "as long as the bin width is chosen to be sufficiently small , the final results we obtain are independent of the redshift binning .",

    "the three lowest - variance eigenfunctions for two different fiducial models are shown in figure  [ fig : eigfn ] .",
    "the lowest eigenmode ( @xmath36 ) is an average of the ionized fraction over the entire redshift range , weighted at high @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath43 mode can be thought of as a difference between the amount of ionization at high @xmath12 and at low @xmath12 , and higher modes follow this pattern with weighted averages of @xmath4 that oscillate with higher and higher frequency in redshift .",
    "eigenfunctions of fiducial models with different values of @xmath44 have similar shapes with the redshift axis rescaled according to the width of @xmath45 . the eigenfunctions are mostly insensitive to the choice of ionized fraction in the constant-@xmath14 fiducial histories .",
    "an arbitrary reionization history can be represented in terms of the eigenfunctions as @xmath46 where the amplitude of eigenmode @xmath35 for a perturbation @xmath47 is @xmath48 [ note that our conventions for the normalization of @xmath49 and @xmath37 differ from those of @xcite by factors of @xmath50 . ]",
    "any global ionization history @xmath4 over the range @xmath51 is completely specified by a set of mode amplitudes @xmath49 .    if perturbations to the fiducial history are small , @xmath52 , then the mode amplitudes are uncorrelated , with covariance matrix @xmath53 .",
    "for a fixed fiducial model , however , arbitrary reionization histories generally have @xmath54 , in which case the amplitudes of different modes can become correlated as we discuss in   [ sec : fisher ] .",
    "the main advantage of using the principal component eigenmodes of @xmath4 instead of some other parameterization is that most of the information relevant for large - scale @xmath0-modes is contained in the first few modes .",
    "this means that if one constructs @xmath4 from equation  ( [ eq : mmutoxe ] ) keeping only the first few terms in the sum over @xmath35 , then the @xmath0-mode spectrum of the resulting ionization history will closely match that of @xmath4 with all modes included in the sum .",
    "the effect of each eigenmode on @xmath6 becomes smaller as @xmath35 increases , as shown in figure  [ fig : zmaxa ] for the first two modes .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for a specific fiducial ionization history @xmath55 and assumed true history , only the first three modes of @xmath4 are needed to produce @xmath6 indistinguishable from the true @xmath0-mode spectrum .",
    "the ionization histories and corresponding @xmath0-mode spectra in figure  [ fig : clcomp ] demonstrate this completeness for a fairly extreme model in which the first ten eigenmodes all have significant amplitudes .",
    "even in the simplest case where a single eigenmode is used in place of the original @xmath4 , the error in @xmath6 is only @xmath56 . with 3 - 5 modes ,",
    "the error is a few percent or less at all multipoles and safely smaller than the cosmic variance of @xmath57 the top panel of figure  [ fig : clcomp ] shows that this completeness does not extend to the ionization history itself : @xmath4 constructed from as many as five eigenmodes is a poor approximation to the full reionization history .    from this and other similar tests on the completeness in @xmath6 of the lowest - variance eigenmodes",
    "we conclude that the first 3 - 5 modes contain essentially all of the information about the reionization history that is relevant for large - scale @xmath0-mode polarization .",
    "this fact is particularly useful for constraining the global reionization history with cmb polarization data using markov chain monte carlo techniques . since the number of parameters that must be added to a monte carlo chain to describe an arbitrary @xmath4 is relatively small",
    ", we can obtain constraints from the data that are independent of assumptions about the reionization history with minimal added computational expense  @xcite .",
    "the exact number of modes required varies depending on the true ionization history and the fiducial history , so when analyzing data it is a good idea to check that the results do not change significantly when the next modes are included in the sum in equation  ( [ eq : mmutoxe ] ) .",
    "the main caveat to this model independence is that in practice we must set some maximum redshift for histories in any particular chain of monte carlo samples , ignoring any contribution to the observed low-@xmath5 @xmath6 from ionization at @xmath58 . since the eigenfunctions of the ionization history",
    "are stretched in redshift as @xmath44 increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eigfn ] ) , at higher @xmath44 more modes are needed to accurately represent any particular feature in @xmath4 .",
    "for example , take the true ionization history to be instantaneous reionization at @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zmaxb ] shows the error in @xmath6 if we truncate the eigenmode sum of equation  ( [ eq : mmutoxe ] ) at @xmath60 modes using fiducial histories with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for each fiducial model ,",
    "the error decreases as the number of modes in the sum increases , but the error at fixed @xmath60 is larger for @xmath61 than @xmath62 .",
    "the requirement of retaining a larger set of parameters as @xmath44 increases makes it less practical to study models with significant reionization at extremely high redshifts [ @xmath63 ; e.g. , @xcite ] , but even for @xmath44 as high as @xmath64 the number of eigenmodes needed is reasonably small ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "while theories of reionization provide useful priors on @xmath44 in the context of specific models , it would be better to be able to constrain @xmath44 empirically by measuring the @xmath0-mode power accurately up to @xmath66 .",
    "the current 3-year _ wmap _",
    "polarization data have high enough signal - to - noise to be useful for parameter constraints only at @xmath67 @xcite , so their sensitivity to high-@xmath12 reionization is limited . given that ionization at some redshift generates polarization out to a maximum @xmath5 , _ wmap _  data can still place weak bounds on the total optical depth contribution above a certain redshift , even if it can not distinguish whether these contributions arise from redshifts above a chosen @xmath44 as we discuss in ",
    "[ sec : wmap ] .",
    "the values we choose here for @xmath44 are partly influenced by the fact that few theoretical reionization scenarios predict an ionized fraction at @xmath68 that would significantly affect large - scale @xmath6 .",
    "future data should better constrain @xmath6 at higher multipoles , allowing useful limits to be placed on @xmath44 from the data alone .",
    "the need to consider a limited range in redshift is shared by other methods , for example those that constrain binned @xmath15 instead of the eigenmode amplitudes @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the principal component approach has the unique advantages that results can be made independent of bin width and that relatively few extra parameters are required .",
    "however , this approach also has a unique difficulty in that the physicality of the reionization history [ @xmath69 is not built in to the method . hence constraints derived from measurements of the eigenmodes can be weaker than those from a method that enforces physicality .",
    "we can , however , place some prior constraints on the set of eigenmode amplitudes that must be satisfied by any physical model , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "although the actual ionized fraction must be between 0 and 1 ( neglecting helium reionization and the small residual ionized fraction after recombination ) , there is nothing in the construction of @xmath4 from the eigenmodes in equation  ( [ eq : mmutoxe ] ) that ensures that the ionized fraction will obey these limits . whether or not @xmath14 has a physical value at a particular redshift depends on the amplitudes of all of the principal components .",
    "even for a physical ionization history , the truncated sum up to mode @xmath60 , @xmath70 is not necessarily bounded by 0 and 1 at all redshifts . while formally it is possible to evaluate @xmath6 for reionization histories with unphysical values of @xmath14 , we would like to eliminate as much as possible those models for which the full sum of the eigenmodes , @xmath71 , is unphysical .",

    "the parameter space that physical models may occupy is restricted further by an inequality that must be satisfied by all eigenmodes simultaneously .",
    "assume for simplicity that the fiducial model has a constant ionized fraction , @xmath79 $ ] , for @xmath80 .",

[ [ eq : orthog1 ] ] ) . comparing equations  ( [ eq : phys2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : phys3 ] ) we obtain a constraint on the sum of the squares of the mode amplitudes , @xmath84 where @xmath85 , depending on the value of @xmath86 .",
    "as with the physicality bounds of equation  ( [ eq : physbounds ] ) , this upper limit is a necessary but not sufficient condition for physicality .    since in practice we can only constrain a limited set of eigenmodes , the uncertainty in modes higher than the first few prevents us from simply excluding all models where @xmath10 or @xmath9 at any redshift because the higher modes can have a significant effect on @xmath4 .",
    "however , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : eigenmodes ] , the higher modes do not affect the polarization power spectrum since the high - frequency oscillations in redshift of higher modes are averaged out .",
    "similarly , such eigenmodes have a small effect on the optical depth from a sufficiently large range in redshift .",
    "for example , the optical depth from @xmath87 due to modes @xmath88 subject to the physicality constraints of this section can be no larger than @xmath89 , and is likely to be smaller for realistic reionization scenarios . because of this , we assume that we can place priors on the _ optical depth _ that correspond to @xmath90 over the relevant range in redshift .",
    "reionization histories with an unphysical optical depth over a large range in redshift are considered to be unphysical models since the addition of higher modes can not perturb the optical depth enough to give it a physical value .",
    "once constraints on the principal components of the reionization history have been obtained from cmb polarization data , there are several ways to use those constraints to place limits on observables such as @xmath2 or to test theories of reionization @xcite .",

    "[ sec : intro ] , the constraint on the total optical depth to reionization depends on the assumed model for @xmath4 .",

    ", @xmath91 , equation  ( [ eq : mmutoxe ] ) yields the corresponding ionization history which can then be integrated to find the optical depth between any two redshifts @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 in particular , the total optical depth to reionization is @xmath95 where @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "the principal component approach provides a model - independent way to constrain @xmath2 , so we expect the results to be unbiased and the uncertainty in @xmath2 to accurately reflect the present uncertainty about @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the information about @xmath98 is encapsulated in the first few eigenmodes , i.e. the truncated ionization history of equation  ( [ eq : trunc ] ) , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 - 5 for typical fiducial models .",
    "the total optical depth and the first principal component amplitude , @xmath101 , are similar quantities in that they are both averages of @xmath4 weighted at high @xmath12 .",
    "as we show in the next section , cmb @xmath0-mode polarization data can constrain higher eigenmodes as well ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "in particular , the second mode should be the next best constrained quantity since it is constructed to have the smallest variance after @xmath101 . since @xmath103 is related to the difference in @xmath14 between high redshift and low redshift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eigfn ] ) , we might guess that besides total @xmath2 the data are mainly constraining the fraction of optical depth coming from high redshift versus low redshift .",
    "given any set of mode amplitudes defining an ionization history , we can compute a low-@xmath12 optical depth , @xmath104 , and a high-@xmath12 optical depth , @xmath105 , for some choice of intermediate redshift , @xmath106 .    note that if either of the redshift ranges @xmath107 $ ] or @xmath108 $ ] is too narrow , constraints on the partial optical depths will be influenced by the physicality priors ( since @xmath109 sets limits on @xmath2 in redshift intervals as discussed in ",

    "besides learning about the relative amount of ionization at @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the partial optical depth constraints also provide a way to empirically set the maximum redshift , @xmath44 .",
    "if some set of data are found to place a tight upper bound on @xmath105 for fairly conservative ( i.e. large ) values of @xmath106 and @xmath44 , then for analyses of future data this value of @xmath106 can be used as a new , lower value for @xmath44 since optical depth from higher redshifts is small .",
    "this approach assumes that there is essentially no reionization earlier than the original @xmath44 , but as long as this initial maximum redshift is taken to be large the presence or absence of high-@xmath12 ionization can be tested in this way over a wide range of redshifts .",

    "moreover , even with current data the principal component constraints are beginning to show the possibility of determining properties of reionization in addition to @xmath2 . by comparing the optical depth from high @xmath12 with that from low @xmath12",
    ", we obtain an upper limit on the contribution to the optical depth from high redshift : @xmath218 at 95% confidence , assuming that there is no significant episode of reionization at @xmath219 .    due to the limitations of noise and foreground contamination , only the first two eigenmodes of the reionization history , @xmath101 and @xmath103 ,",
    "can be determined with present polarization data to any reasonable degree of accuracy .",
    "constraints on these two modes come primarily from the main , broad peak in @xmath0-mode power at low @xmath5 from reionization .",
    "as measurements of the @xmath0-mode polarization improve , for example from additional _ wmap _  data or through planned future experiments such as _ planck _ , better knowledge of the low - power `` trough '' in @xmath6 between the main reionization peak and the first acoustic peak should enable constraints on the third and higher principal components , up to about @xmath220 for near cosmic variance - limited data .",
    "since constraints on these higher modes rely on the ability to identify subtle features in the trough of @xmath6 , the ultimate accuracy to which the eigenmodes can be determined may depend on whether or not the necessary features are well reproduced in the particular random draw of @xmath6 that is available to us . however , even if we are unlucky enough to have a realization in which some of the important features of the spectrum are washed out by randomness , it should still be possible to measure several of the principal components to better accuracy than is currently possible .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath221 eigenmodes of @xmath4 , along with improved constraints on @xmath101 and @xmath103 , will allow more stringent tests of reionization models and a better understanding of the global reionization history .",
