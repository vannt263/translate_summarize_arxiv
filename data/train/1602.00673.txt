    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf ( wd ) stars @xcite .",
    "they play a key role in galactic chemical enrichment through fe - peak elements @xcite , as cosmological probes to investigate dark energy @xcite and constrain @xmath4cdm parameters @xcite , and as sites of cosmic ray acceleration along with other sn types @xcite .",
    "however , the exact nature of their progenitor systems remains mysterious . while it is clear that the exploding star must be a c / o wd in a binary system @xcite , decades of intensive observational and theoretical work have failed to establish whether the binary companion is a non - degenerate star ( the so - called single degenerate , or sd , scenario ) , another wd ( double degenerate , dd  see @xcite for recent reviews ) , or some combination of scenarios .",
    "both cases result in the explosion of a relatively massive wd after one or potentially many more mass accretion episodes , but there are key differences between them . in the sd scenario , the accretion happens over relatively long timescales ( @xmath5yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) until the mass of the wd gets close to the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath6 @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mean number of electrons per baryon , @xcite ) . in the dd scenario ,",
    "the explosion is the result of the violent interaction or merging of two wds on a dynamical timescale @xcite , and the mass of the exploding object is not expected to be directly tied to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "attempts to discriminate between sd and dd systems based on these differences have had varying degrees of success .",
    "on the one hand , it is known that wds in the milky way merge at a rate comparable to sn ia explosions @xcite , and statistical studies of the ejecta and @xmath9ni mass distribution of sn ia indicate that a significant fraction of them are not near - chandrasekhar events @xcite . on the other hand , the large amount of neutron - rich material found in solar abundances @xcite and in some supernova remnants ( snrs ) believed to be of type ia origin @xcite seems to require burning at high densities , which indicates that at least _ a non - negligible fraction _ of sne ia explode close to @xmath6 .",
    "here we focus on the role that these neutron - rich isotopes play as probes of sn ia explosion physics and progenitor evolution channels .",
    "in particular , we explore the effect of carbon simmering , a process wherein slowly accreting near-@xmath6 wds develop a large convective core due to energy input from @xmath10c fusion on timescales of @xmath11 yr before the onset of explosive burning @xcite .",
    "previous studies @xcite have pointed out that weak nuclear reactions during this phase enhance the level of neutronization in the fuel that will be later consumed in the different regimes of explosive nucleosynthesis . here ,",
    "we perform detailed models of slowly accreting wds with the stellar evolution code ` mesa ` @xcite , paying close attention to the impact of carbon simmering on the neutron excess .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ neutron ] , we provide an overview of the main processes contributing to neutronization in sne  ia , and the importance of understanding these processes in the context of observational probes of sn  ia explosion physics and the pre - sn evolution of their stellar progenitors . in section",
    "[ models ] , we outline our simulation scheme and describe our grid of ` mesa ` models for accreting wds . in section [ results ] , we present the main results obtained from our model grid , and in section [ conclusions ] , we summarize our conclusions and suggest directions for future studies .",
    "it is commonly accepted that wds are the end product of most main - sequence stars ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a typical wd is a @xmath12 stellar object made up by a c / o core that encompasses most of its size , surrounded by an thin @xmath13he envelope that , in turn , has a shallower @xmath14h layer on top @xcite . on the other hand , massive wds ( @xmath15 )",
    "are believed to have o / ne cores .",
    "therefore , the composition of the core and the outer layers strongly depends on the characteristics of the initial star @xcite .",
    "the specific chemical composition of a wd determines its properties , which can vary after the agb phase , along the cooling track , via important processes such as convection , phase transitions of the core and gravitational settling of the chemical elements @xcite . for this abundance differentiation the main role",
    "is played by @xmath16ne @xcite because its neutron excess makes it sink towards the interior as the wd cools .",
    "the released gravitational energy by this process influences both the cooling times of wds @xcite and the properties of sne ia @xcite .    a critical parameter that controls the synthesis of neutron - rich isotopes in sn ia explosions is the neutron excess @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the neutron number , the nucleon number and charge of species @xmath21 with mass fraction @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the starting value of @xmath23 in the sn ia progenitor is set by its metallicity .",
    "this works as follows .",
    "stars with zero - age main - sequence masses @xmath24 burn hydrogen through the cno cycle @xcite .",
    "the slowest step is @xmath25 , which causes all the c , n and o present in the plasma to pile up at @xmath26 .",
    "subsequently , during the hydrostatic he burning , @xmath26 converts to the neutron - enriched isotope @xmath27ne through the reaction chain @xmath28 .",
    "because all cno elements are converted to @xmath16ne during he burning , there is a linear relationship between the metallicity of a main sequence star and the neutron excess in the wd it eventually produces .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that this process relates the neutron excess of the wd and its progenitor metallicity via @xmath29 , where @xmath30 refers to the mass fraction of cno elements , resulting in a value for solar metallicity material of @xmath31 .",
    "gravitational settling of @xmath32 might enhance the relative neutronization in the core , but only at the expense of shallower material from the outer layers @xcite .",
    "this relation between @xmath23 and @xmath30 can subsequently be modified by carbon simmering @xcite , and we summarize the main features of this process in figure [ rhot ] .",
    "carbon ignition in the core of a wd takes places through the channels @xmath33 and @xmath34 with a branching ratio 0.56/0.44 for @xmath35 @xcite when the heat from these nuclear reactions surpasses the neutrino cooling .",
    "this burning regime @xcite , which starts at the gray , dashed line in figure  [ rhot ] , marks the onset of simmering .",
    "the central conditions then trace out the rising dashed , brown line as the star heats and decreases slightly in density . at the same time",
    ", a convective region grows outward @xcite , shown at four different epochs with thick , solid lines .",
    "this convection encompasses @xmath36 during a period of @xmath37yr before the final thermonuclear runaway at a central temperature of @xmath38 and the explosion as a type ia  sn @xcite .    during",
    "carbon simmering , the protons produced by the @xmath39 reaction capture onto @xmath10c , producing @xmath40n .",
    "subsequently , the electron - capture reactions @xmath41n(@xmath42 , @xmath43)@xmath40c@xmath44 ( discussed in detail in section 2.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath45na(@xmath42 , @xmath43)@xmath46ne@xmath44 @xcite produce an enhancement in the neutronization of the core .",
    "these reactions consume the products of carbon fusion , so this increase in @xmath23 is directly related to the amount of carbon consumed prior to the explosion .",
    "this proceeds until sufficiently high temperatures or low densities are reached such that timescale for the @xmath46na electron captures becomes longer than the heating timescale .",
    "( the location where these timescales are equal is shown as a magenta , dashed line in figure [ rhot ] . ) additionally , as we find here , @xmath45ne carried into lower density regions of the convection zone can be converted back to @xmath46na by beta decay .",
    "these nuclear processes determine the final composition and properties of the ejected material @xcite and are crucial to obtain synthetic spectra @xcite .    using these basic arguments , @xcite semi -",
    "analytically calculated the amount of carbon consumed during simmering to estimate that the increase in the neutron excess should be @xmath47 with an upper bound of 0.93@xmath48 known as the `` simmering limit '' .",
    "such a floor to the neutron excess is important to identify because it should be present in any sn ia progenitor that went through a simmering phase , regardless of how low the progenitor s metallicity is . using a more detailed nuclear network , but only focusing on the central conditions of the convective zone",
    ", @xcite predicted a decrement in the mean number of electrons per baryon of @xmath49 , which corresponds to @xmath50 .",
    "although both these works found similar levels of neutronization , they also made strong simplifications , and this is an important motivation for revisiting these results here .",
    "weak reactions can also affect the thermal state of the wd .",
    "an urca pair consists of two nuclei @xmath51 and @xmath52 that are connected by electron - capture @xmath53 and beta - decay @xmath54 . below a threshold density",
    "@xmath55 the beta - decay reaction is favored and above it the electron - capture reaction is favored . near this threshold density ,",
    "both reactions occur at a significant rate , and since each produces a neutrino that then free - streams from the star , this has the net effect of cooling the plasma @xcite .",
    "as the wd is compressed , its density increases above the threshold density of numerous urca pairs .",
    "for the compositions and densities of our wd models , the two most important urca pairs are @xmath56mg@xmath56na ( with @xmath57 ) and @xmath46na@xmath46ne ( with @xmath58 ) @xcite .",
    "these threshold densities are below the density at which carbon ignition occurs , and hence in the central parts of the wd _ this local urca - process cooling occurs before the simmering phase begins_. this effect was discussed in the context of accreting c / o cores by @xcite , but is often not included in progenitor models . we make use of new capabilities of ` mesa ` that allow these processes to be easily included @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ tcvsrhoc_urca ] , additional cooling shifts the point at which carbon ignition occurs to higher densities",
    ". the specific energy loss rate due to urca - process neutrinos scales @xmath59 @xcite , so this effect is most pronounced in hotter wds ( those with short cooling ages ) .    ) with ( black line ) and without ( dashed line ) the effects of the @xmath46na@xmath46ne and @xmath56mg@xmath56na urca pairs ( see section [ urca ] ) .",
    "the evolution during the simmering phase is denoted with thick lines .",
    "the gray , dashed line is an approximate c - ignition curve from ` mesa ` that considers a 100% carbon composition in the core . ]",
    "after carbon ignition occurs and the simmering phase begins , the urca process continues to operate as convection mixes material from regions where it has electron - captured into regions where it will beta - decay and vice - versa .",
    "this _ convective _ urca process and its effects have been an object of considerable study ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we allow for the operation of the convective urca process in our ` mesa ` models , inasmuch as we incorporate appropriate weak rates and allow composition to mix throughout the convective zone .",
    "however , limitations imposed by the temporal and spatial averaging that enter into a formulation of 1d mixing - length theory do not allow us to self - consistently treat the effects of the urca process on the convection itself . in some of our models , in particular those with the solar or super - solar metallicities and",
    "hence the highest abundances of @xmath56 mg and @xmath46na , we observe that , when the convective zone first reaches the urca shell , the former splits in two and remains split for the remainder of the calculation .",
    "it seems likely this behavior is a manifestation of these limitations , so when we report our results in tables  [ table_0gyr]-[table_10gyr ] , we mark these models with the note `` convection zone splits during simmering '' .",
    "the development of a model able to fully incorporate the interaction of convection and the urca process is beyond the scope of this work and will likely require multi - dimensional hydrodynamics simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "given the existing uncertainties , @xcite explored the possible effects of the convective urca process in ` mesa ` models by employing a series of mixing assumptions , such as limiting the mass of the convective core to the mass coordinate of the @xmath46na@xmath46ne urca shell .",
    "future work could employ a similar approach to explore the potential effects of the convective urca process on neutronization .",
    "motivated by the discussion above , we next explore the impact of the neutron - rich isotopes at wd formation and during carbon simmering using ` mesa`[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xcite .",
    "we create wds with five different metallicities : @xmath60 star . however ,",

    ", we start from 4.5@xmath63 zams - models by using the inlists from the suite case ` make_co_wd ` , which makes a protostar go through the ms until the agb thermal pulses and then reveals its c / o core .",
    "these models are stopped when the total luminosity reaches @xmath64 . `",
    "mesa ` presents convergence problems due to the unstable he shell burning on accreting wds @xcite , so we artificially remove the h / he shallower envelope via a negative accretion rate .",
    "the resulting wds have @xmath65 .",
    "then , we rescale the initial masses of our wds to 0.70 , 0.85 and 1.00@xmath63 without changing the chemical composition as a function of the lagrangian mass coordinate .    to evaluate the effect of cooling times in the properties of wds @xcite , we let our stars cool for 1 and 10 gyr , ages that are consistent with the spread for the delay - time distribution ( dtd ) of sne ia ( @xmath6640 myr10 gyr , * ? ? ?",

    "we do not account for residual heating by the external h / he envelope @xcite , as this material has already been removed in our models .",
    "we also do not include the effects of diffusion , sedimentation , or crystallization , as the development of ` mesa ` s treatment of these processes is ongoing . with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we classify our wds as `` hot '' ( no cooling applied ) , `` warm '' ( 1 gyr ) and `` cold '' ( 10 gyr ) .",
    "we use these 45 wds ( five metallicities , three masses , and three cooling ages ) as an input for our simmering ` mesa ` inlists , based on the suite case ` wd_ignite ` , which models the accretion in the type ia sne sd channel by considering a c / o wd , a uniform , pure c / o accretion and a stopping condition such that the total luminosity from the nuclear reactions reaches @xmath67 .",
    "we use a nuclear network consisting of 48 isotopes , shown in table [ table_isotopes ] , and the reactions linking them .",

    "although we do find some small differences between models , figure [ panel4 ] demonstrates that the range of possible neutron excesses is relatively small , and thus we take the fiducial simmering limit to be 0.22@xmath48 ( yellow , shaded region in figure [ etaz_models ] ) , well below the value found by @xcite for the reasons outlined in the discussions above .             for the large magellanic cloud @xcite",

    "we have performed the first study of carbon simmering in sne ia progenitors with numerical models that fully resolve the extent of the convective region and include a complete nuclear network with urca processes .",
    "we find that the final mass of the convective zone in the accreting wd is in the range of @xmath119 .",
    "our final values for the increase in the central neutron excess @xmath107 before the onset of thermonuclear runaway are fairly constant at @xmath120 .",
    "these values are @xmath2 lower than those found by previous studies @xcite , with the difference stemming from our ability to properly resolve the full density profile of the convection zone and determine accurately where and at what rate electron captures occur .",
    "as the convection zone grows , it eventually spans many density scale heights , with electron captures favored in regions above the threshold density and beta decays favored in regions below it .",
    "while the convective zone remains fully mixed , the overall neutronization is determined by the mass - weighted average of the reaction rates across the convection zone .    as summarized in figure [ etaz_models ] , the lower simmering floor that we obtain makes it more challenging to find an observational `` smoking gun '' for the presence of simmering in sn ia progenitors with metallicities @xmath121 , typical of the thin disk of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the strongest constraints on the degree of neutronization in individual sn ia progenitors come from the analysis of the x - ray emission from fe - peak nuclei ( mn , cr , fe , and ni ) in galactic snrs like tycho , kepler and 3c 397 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the dynamically young snrs tycho and kepler , where the bulk of the shocked fe - peak elements were synthesized in the explosive si burning regime @xcite , the mn / cr mass ratio is a clean tracer of progenitor neutronization . @xcite and @xcite found a high level of neutronization in these snrs , which translates to super - solar progenitor metallicities @xmath122 and @xmath123 if the contribution from simmering is neglected .",
    "the constraints on the progenitor neutronization in snr 3c 397 are more model - dependent because this is a dynamically older object , and the shocked ejecta has a large contribution from neutron - rich nse material .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite also found that , neglecting the contribution from simmering , chandrasekhar - mass explosion models for this snr require very high ( @xmath124 ) progenitor metallicities .",
    "these high levels of neutronization in galactic type ia snrs seem to be in tension with our results , because simmering is unable to reconcile the observations with a population of progenitors that is typical of the thin disk of the milky way , which contains very few stars with @xmath125 .",
    "we hope to gain further insight on this apparent mismatch between models and observations by examining type ia snrs in the lmc , which should have progenitor metallicities @xmath126 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ etaz_models ] ) , low enough to clearly determine whether their progenitors underwent a carbon simmering phase and constrain the resulting degree of neutronization .    in the future , our models could be used as an input for sne cosmology and explosion studies , as done by @xcite and @xcite , who created models with ` mesa ` and then employed a different code @xcite to track the evolution of the supernova light curves . using our models as inputs for explosive burning calculations",
    "would also be helpful for exploring the impact of the centrally neutron - enhanced core on the explosion and the resulting light curve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite studied the influence of @xmath16ne on the laminar flame speed , energy release , and nucleosynthesis during the sn explosion .",
    "the enhanced neutronization would have a similar impact , and although the influence of the @xmath16ne was found to be modest in these studies , we also predict spatial differences caused by the presence of the convection zone .",
    "in addition , there are pieces of physics that could be added to our simmering models .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ models ] , the gravitational settling of @xmath32 will be implemented in an upcoming ` mesa ` release .",
    "we expect to revisit these models with a more complete approach including this process , as well as an in - depth treatment of the chemical diffusion and rotation during convection . @xcite and @xcite initially explored these effects with a series of semi - analytic models , and it will be interesting to revisit them with a more realistic treatment .",
    "the properties of the convective zone and neutron excess we found here are fairly homogeneous over a wide range of parameters .",
    "therefore , it will be useful to see if other effects can add more diversity .",
    "we thank the whole ` mesa ` community for their unconditional help during the elaboration of this paper , and especially frank timmes for useful discussions in regards to the implementation of nuclear reactions in ` mesa ` .",

    "interpolation in the coarse ` weaklib ` tables leads to a systematic underestimate of the @xmath46ne beta - decay rates .",
