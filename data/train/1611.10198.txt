    "the axiomatic approach to space - time proposed by ehlers , pirani and schild in @xcite , tries to build a suitable mathematical model of space - time from basic assumptions about the behavior of freely falling particles and the propagation of light rays .",
    "these are considered to be the _ primitive concepts _ and other constructions should be derived from these elements plus some set of hypotheses about their behavior which should be as natural as possible .",
    "this program led eps to show that the propagation of light determines a _ conformal structure _ on space - time , while the motion of freely falling particles determines a _ projective structure _ on space - time .",
    "they require these two structures to satisfy a _",
    "compatibility condition _ , which then leads to a _",
    "weyl structure _ as the resulting mathematical model .",
    "up to this point , they conclude that the propagation of light and the motion of freely falling particles determine a weyl structure as a natural model of space - time .",
    "they proceed to propose two ( apparently different ) possible axioms which then reduce the former to the structure of a _ weyl integrable _ space - time has to vanish , they conclude that space - time geometry has a riemannian representation .",
    "this is true , since the vanishing of @xmath0 implies ( in a simply connected domain ) that the weyl structure is integrable , and in any weyl integrable structure there is a riemannian representative of the class . ] .",
    "the previous axioms express quite general ideas which deal with simple aspects of the motion of freely falling particles and light rays , while the last axiom seems to deal with much more delicate details regarding the behavior of _ clocks_. in particular , in order to discuss the behavior of clocks in this context , we should first have a well - defined and physically sensible notion of _ proper time_. this notion seems to be at the core of the different discussions , which took place after weyl s proposal of his unified theory , concerning the viability of weyl s space - time as an acceptable model for physics .",
    "some of these discussions , which involved weyl , einstein , eddington and pauli , among others , can be reviewed in @xcite .",
    "although in their paper eps give a mathematically well - defined notion of proper time , this notion , in the way they introduce it , does not seem to be motivated by the motion of freely falling particles or light rays @xcite . on the other hand , the existence of a well - defined and physically sensible definition of proper time in a weyl structure has been carefully discussed by v. perlick @xcite . at first sight",
    ", perlick s definition might not seem to be very much related with the one given by eps . in this paper , we will show that the concept of perlick s proper time may be motivated by the axiomatic approach given by eps , and that his definition is not only mathematically well - defined , but also physically sensible .",
    "we then will show the equivalence of eps s and perlick s definition , and that the latter leads to the second clock effect .",
    "finally , we will show that , if we were to rule out models of space - time exhibiting such an effect , then we would arrive at what is called a `` weyl integrable space - time '' _ _ structure .",
    "in fact , this claim has been stated previously , using , however , a different line of reasoning @xcite .",
    "since in this paper we will accept , in view of @xcite , that the motion of freely falling particles and light rays determine a weyl structure on space - time , we will shortly review the basic definitions of such a structure .",
    "a weyl manifold is a triple @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a differentiable manifold , @xmath3 a semi - riemannian metric on @xmath2 , and @xmath4 a 1-form field on @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 is endowed with a torsion - free linear connection @xmath5 satisfying the following _ compatibility condition _ : @xmath6 results concerning the existence and uniqueness of such a connection are straightforward and their proofs are analogous to those known for the riemannian case @xcite .",
    "it can easily be shown that , in local coordinates , the components of the weyl connection @xmath5 have form : @xmath7    an important and useful result concerning weyl connections is given by the following proposition :    [ weylcomp ] a linear connection @xmath5 is said to be compatible with a weyl structure @xmath1 if , and only if , @xmath8 we have @xmath9    let us now note that the compatibility condition ( [ compatibility ] ) is invariant under the following group of transformations : @xmath10{ll}\\overline{g}=e^{-f}g & \\\\ \\overline{\\omega}=\\omega - df & \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{weyl group}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is an arbitrary smooth function defined on @xmath2 . by this",
    "we mean that if @xmath5 is compatible with @xmath12 then it is also compatible with @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to check that these transformations define an equivalence relation between weyl manifolds . in this way",
    ", every member of the class is compatible with the same connection , hence has the same geodesics , curvature tensor and any other property that depends only on the connection .",
    "this is the reason why it is regarded more natural , when dealing with weyl manifolds , to consider the whole class of equivalence @xmath14,[\\omega])$ ] rather than working with a particular element of this class . in this sense , it is argued that only geometrical quantities that are invariant under ( [ weyl group ] ) are of real significance in the case of weyl geometry .",
    "following the same line of argument , it is also assumed that only physical theories and physical quantities presenting this kind of invariance should be considered of interest in this context . to conclude this section",
    ", we remark that when the one - form field @xmath4 is an exact form , then the weyl structure is called _",
    "in this section , the main idea is to introduce a definition of _ proper time _ which would naturally fit the axiomatic approach proposed by ehlers , pirani and schild . in this work",
    ", we will disregard the last of the eps and @xmath15 , if we consider a regular sequence of events @xmath16 in the world line of @xmath17 determined by the ticking of this clock , and the einstein - simultaneous sequence of events @xmath18 in the world line of @xmath15 , then @xmath18 should also be a regular sequence of events . with the help of the geodesic deviation equation ,",
    "eps show that this hypothesis reduces the weyl structure to a riemannian one .",
    "another way to achieve the same the same goal , is the consider as an axiom that the `` norm '' of parallel transported vector fields at a point can not depend on the curve chosen to make the transport , associating this `` norm '' , for the case of time - like curves , to the ticking rate of clocks . ]",
    "axioms , however retaining that the motion of freely falling particles and light rays determine a weyl structure as a suitable mathematical model of space - time . in this way",
    "we will think of the space - time geometry as given by a structure of the form @xmath14,[\\omega])$ ] .",
    "on the other hand , in this scenario , we will use the following idea to guide an axiomatic definition of proper time :    _ a freely falling particle should see itself freely falling . _    with this statement we mean that the proper time parametrization of a freely falling particle should be such that the equation of motion of this particle satisfies the geodesic equation .",
    "this idea has already been suggested in @xcite .",
    "a freely falling particle @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is freely falling if it is a pregeodesic , that is , if @xmath21 our principle is that proper time parametrization is a reparametrization of @xmath22 that transforms it into a geodesic .",
    "then , if @xmath23 is a time - like curve representing a freely falling particle , it is straightforward to see that @xmath22 is parametrized by proper time if , and only if @xmath24    this notion of proper time fits naturally into the picture proposed by eps , since we are using the basic concepts of their construction to motivate it .",
    "our next step should be to generalize this definition for arbitrary time - like curves , which represent arbitrary particles . obviously , since , in general , particles are not freely falling , ( [ pt1 ] ) does not generalize naturally to the general case .",
    "however , ( [ pt2 ] ) does , and , as we have just seen , ( [ pt1 ] ) and ( [ pt2 ] ) are equivalent in the case of freely falling particles .",
    "this leads us to the following definition , which is precisely the one given by v. perlick in @xcite :    a time - like curve @xmath19 , @xmath25 , is called a _ standard clock _ if @xmath26 is orthogonal to @xmath27 .    in order to check that this definition is mathematically consistent with the fact that we are working with a weyl structure , we should check that it is independent of the representative member of the class chosen to carry out the computations .",
    "suppose that for some particular @xmath28 $ ] we have @xmath29 .",
    "then , since @xmath5 is independent of the choice of the representative , so is the covariant derivative , and hence @xmath26 does not depend on this choice .",
    "also , since any other @xmath30 $ ] is related to @xmath3 by a conformal transformation , then orthogonality of vectors is preserved .",
    "thus , the definition is consistent in the whole class .",
    "also , in order for this definition to be sensible , we should show that any time - like curve can be parametrized by this kind of parametrization . to see this ,",
    "consider a time - like curve @xmath31 we are looking for a reparametrization of @xmath22 such that the reparametrized curve is a standard clock .",
    "this means that we are looking for a diffeomorphism @xmath32 such that @xmath33 is a standard clock . with this set - up",
    ", we see that @xmath34 and @xmath35 also from ( [ pt3 ] ) we get @xmath36 then , the following equation is satisfied : @xmath37 from this last equation we see that @xmath38 is a standard clock if , and only if , the reparametrization @xmath39 satisfies the following differential equation : @xmath40    we then see that if a reparametrization @xmath41 makes @xmath42 a standard clock , then it satisfies ( [ pt4 ] ) .",
    "conversely , given a solution of ( [ pt4 ] ) with initial conditions such that @xmath43 , then there is a neighborhood @xmath44 of @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a diffeomorphism , and hence the reparametrization @xmath47 will be a standard clock .",
    "thus , we can state that given a time - like curve @xmath48 , there is a reparametrization which makes it a standard clock if , and only if , the equation ( [ pt4 ] ) admits a solution with @xmath49 .",
    "since this type of differential equation always admits solutions for given initial data @xmath50 , then a given time - like curve @xmath22 can always be reparametrized in a neighborhood of any point , so as to make it a standard clock .",
    "seeing that this definition makes mathematical sense , we will use it to define _",
    "proper time_.    we will say that a time - like curve @xmath22 is parametrized by proper time if the parametrized curve is a standard clock .    concerning the above definitions",
    ", the following remarks should be made:1 ) using the same notations as above , the map @xmath51 , maps an arbitrary parametrization @xmath52 to proper time @xmath53.2 ) since ( [ pt4 ] ) is linear , if @xmath39 is a solution then @xmath54 is also a solution , where @xmath55 are arbitrary constants .",
    "these constants are determined by the initial conditions , and they just represent the scale @xmath56 and the zero of the clock @xmath57",
    ".    it will be important to note that a general solution of equation ( [ pt4 ] ) can be obtained . in order to do this , first note",
    "that from _ proposition _ [ weylcomp ] we have @xmath58 this leads to @xmath59 going back to ( [ pt4 ] ) and using ( [ pt5 ] ) we get @xmath60 in order to integrate this equation , first define @xmath61 , and then ( [ pt6 ] ) is reduced to a first order linear ordinary differential equation for @xmath62 , which can easily be integrated , yielding @xmath63^{\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\\omega(\\gamma^{\\prime}(u))du}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can now integrate this equation once more and get the general solution for ( [ pt4 ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see that doing this we get the following : @xmath64 if @xmath65 denotes the elapsed proper time between @xmath45 and @xmath66 we can write @xmath67    as a final comment about the mathematical consistency of our present definition of proper time , we remark that the expression ( [ explicitpt ] ) , which is the expression to be used when computing the elapsed proper time measured by an observer between two events , is invariant both under the weyl transformations ( [ weyl group ] )  and reparametrizations of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we can say that we have a mathematically consistent definition of proper time in the framework of weyl geometry .",
    "let us now analyze whether it is physically sensible to adopt this definition .",
    "in order to address this question we will consider three points .",
    "we claim that the above definition of proper time coincides with the usual definition adopted in general relativity and other metric theories of gravity where the underlying space - time structure is that of a riemannian manifold . in order to see this , consider this definition when the manifold @xmath68 is riemannian .",
    "let @xmath22 be a time - like curve .",
    "in this case , the compatibility of @xmath5 with @xmath3 gives @xmath69 so @xmath48 is standard clock if and only if @xmath70 is constant along @xmath48 .",
    "this means that @xmath22 is parametrized by arc - length , or an affine reparametrization of it .",
    "we conclude that our definition is consistent with the riemannian limit .",
    "if the 1-form field @xmath4 is exact , i.e , if @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is some smooth scalar field @xmath72 on @xmath2 , then we say that the weyl structure is _ integrable , _ and accordingly the resulting space - time is called _ weyl integrable space - time ( wist)_. this kind of geometry has recently attracted the attention of some cosmologists @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in the case of wist",
    ", it is already known that it is possible to define the proper time interval between two events along a curve @xmath48 in an invariant way as @xcite @xmath73 it is easy to see that this quantity is invariant under the group of weyl transformation defined in ( [ weyl group ] ) .",
    "we want to show that perlick s definition reduces to this expression in the case of a wist model . in order to do this , consider the explicit expression ( [ explicitpt ] ) and set @xmath71 .",
    "this will lead to @xmath74 which , by an appropriate setting of the scale to make @xmath75 reproduces the wist definition of proper time .",
    "it seems that in any plausible physical definition proper time intervals should be additive .",
    "this means that if an observer experiences three events @xmath76 and @xmath77 in that order , then given two identical clocks , the time interval measured by a single clock from @xmath78 to @xmath77 should be the same as the sum of the time intervals measured by the other from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , and from @xmath79 to @xmath77 .",
    "thus , for the above definition of proper time to be acceptable , it must be the case that if we use ( [ explicitpt ] ) to make computations in both situations , the results should be the same .",
    "given by @xmath80 . ]        in order to check that the definition for perlick s proper time is additive , we need to compute the proper time elapsed between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and between @xmath79 and @xmath77 , separately by using ( [ explicitpt ] ) .",
    "then we have to add these results , and this should equal the result we would get if we were to make a single computation between @xmath78 and @xmath77 . carrying out these calculations we get @xmath81 on the other hand , from ( [ ptdiffeq1 ] ) we know that @xmath82^{\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_{a}}^{t_{b}}\\omega ( \\gamma^{\\prime}(s))ds}.\\ ] ] after substituting the above equation into the expression for @xmath83 we have @xmath84 finally , adding up the results we obtain @xmath85 which proves the additivity of proper time intervals .    from the above arguments we are led to conclude that perlick s definition of proper time is both mathematically consistent and physically sensible . in the next section",
    ", we will show that this definition is , in fact , equivalent to the definition proposed by ehlers , pirani and schild in their original paper @xcite .",
    "let us begin by recalling the definition of proper time given by eps @xcite : we say that a time - like curve @xmath22 is parametrized by proper time if the tangent vector @xmath86 is _ congruent _ at each point of the curve to a non - null vector @xmath87 which is parallel - transported along @xmath22 .",
    "in the previous sentence , _ congruence _ of vectors at a point means that both vectors have the same _ norm _ , _ i.e _ , @xmath88 .",
    "we will now establish the equivalence between both definitions .",
    "a time - like curve is parametrized by proper time according to eps if it is parametrized by proper time acordding to definition 2 .",
    "suppose that we have a time - like curve @xmath22 parametrized by proper time according to eps and let @xmath89 denote such parametrization .",
    "then , by definition , there exists a parallel vector field @xmath87 along @xmath22 satisfying the following condition : @xmath90 thus , differentiating the previous identity , using weyl s compatibility condition and the fact that @xmath87 is a parallel vector field , we get the following . @xmath91 hence @xmath22 is parametrized by proper time acording to definition 2 .    in order to prove the converse ,",
    "suppose that @xmath22 is parametrized by proper time according to definition 2 .",
    "then , by hypothesis , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are orthogonal .",
    "now consider the following initial value problem : @xmath94 which defines a unique parallel vector field along @xmath22 . since @xmath87 is a parallel vector , using weyl s compatibility condition",
    ", we see that @xmath95 satisfies the following equation @xmath96 using the compatibility condition and the fact that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are orthogonal , we see that @xmath97 also satisfies the previous equation .",
    "furthermore , both solutions initially agree , that is , @xmath98 .",
    "then , by uniqueness of solutions , we get that @xmath99 , which means that @xmath22 is parametrized by proper time according to eps .    with the previous result we have established the equivalence of both definitions .",
    "this is an interesting fact , since , at first sight , the two definitions do not seem to be intimately related to each other .",
    "it is also worth noting that these two definitions have been widely used in the literature .",
    "however , it seems to us , that when an author accepts one of them , makes no reference to the other ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "thus , if we establish the equivalence between the two definitions , then there will be no ambiguity any longer .",
    "in this section , we investigate the question of whether or not a space - time modelled as a weyl structure , in which proper time is understood according to perlick s definition , exhibits the so - called _ second clock effect_. as is well known , we say that a space - time model exhibits the second clock effect if the clock rate of clocks depends on their histories @xcite .    in order to give an answer to this question consider the following situation .",
    "suppose that we transport two identical standard clocks along a time - like curve from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , and then , at @xmath79 , they separate , following different paths @xmath100 and @xmath101 until they merge again at event @xmath77 ( see fig .",
    "[ secondclock ] ) , after which they continue their journey together along the same path .",
    "suppose that both clocks were synchronized at @xmath78 .",
    "thinking of a clock as a device that counts the number of cycles of some periodic process , what we are saying when we refer to synchronization is that identical clocks use the same type of process and that the periods of these cycles were set to be equal at @xmath78 ( both clocks are set with the same scale at @xmath78 ) .",
    "now assume that our space - time model does not exhibit a second clock effect . accepting",
    "this hypothesis means that we would expect that the clock rate of a clock , at a given event in space - time , should depend only on _ local properties _ of the clock , that is , its position , instant velocity , instant acceleration , etc , but not on its history .",
    "therefore , in the particular case we are considering , after we bring back the two identical clocks together at @xmath102 and keep them together , we would expect their clock rates to coincide .",
    "in other words , we would expect the number of cycles counted by either clock after @xmath77 to be the same .",
    "this also means that the readings of the two clocks would coincide at any subsequent event @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "these considerations give us a way to test a possible existence of the second clock effect : compute the elapsed time for both clocks between @xmath77 and some subsequent event @xmath103 and see whether they agree or not . if they do not",
    ", then clearly there is a second clock effect .     and",
    "@xmath101 represent the world lines of c1 and c2 respectively , while @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote the portions of these curves between @xmath79 and @xmath77 .",
    ", width=151 ]    let us now , with the help of ( [ explicitpt ] ) , carry out some calculations to make the above discussion more precise .",
    "first , let us recall that after the event @xmath77 both clocks are being transported along the same time - like curve @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that the curve @xmath22 is parametrized by some arbitrary parameter @xmath107 .",
    "then , from ( [ explicitpt ] ) we have @xmath108 where @xmath89 and @xmath109 represent the readings of clocks 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "we can also compute @xmath110 and @xmath111 using ( [ explicitpt ] ) . in order to make this computation",
    ", we will consider that the parametrization @xmath107 used for @xmath22 after @xmath77 is the parametrization used to parametrize the whole time - like path of clock 1 . on the other hand , for the path of clock 2 we will use @xmath112 as a parameter .",
    "then , a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath113 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the curves representing the world lines of each clock .",
    "now , since from @xmath78 to @xmath79 and after @xmath77 both world lines are the same , both curves being equal in these intervals , we could reparametrize @xmath101 by changing from @xmath112 to @xmath107 to obtain @xmath114 thus we have @xmath115 since @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( recalling that it is the same curve with the same parametrization ) , then for the reading of clock 2 we get @xmath118 also , as both clocks have the same scale at the event @xmath78 , that is , @xmath119 we finally get @xmath120 thus we are led to conclude that    _ a weyl space - time does not exhibit a second clock effect if , and only if , @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath100 and @xmath101 are time - like curves joining the same pair of events @xmath78 and @xmath79 . _    taking into consideration the previous statement , we are now in position to discuss whether or not a weyl structure is a suitable model for space - time . in this framework",
    "we have an unambiguous , well - defined and physically sensible definition for proper time , and we have arrived at the conclusion that a general weyl space - time exhibits a second clock effect .",
    "we note that up to now this kind of effect has never been measured , and we could also give interesting arguments , which would , at least , set strong constraints on the values of this effect ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "then , it is natural to ask , what would be the most general mathematical structure of space - time if we were to reject space - times exhibiting a second clock effect .",
    "if , in the previous statement , we could drop the condition that the curves @xmath100 and @xmath101 are time - like , then it is immediate to see that the non - existence of a second clock effect would imply that the 1-form @xmath4 must be be closed .",
    "if , in turn , we assume that space - time is simply connected , then we would be led to a weyl integrable space - time . in what follows , we will show that even if the timelike character of the curves is kept , a weyl integrable space - time still emerges as a consequence of the non - existence of a second clock effect .",
    "thus , let us suppose that @xmath4 is path independent when integrated over time - like curves and see what this implies .",
    "first consider an arbitrary event in space - time , @xmath123 , and the set of events @xmath124  that are causally connected with @xmath125 .",
    "thus @xmath124 is defined as @xmath126 which is an open subset of @xmath2 . on this set",
    "define the following function : @xmath127 where @xmath22 is any time - like curve joining @xmath125 and @xmath128 ( see figure [ definition ] ) since , by hypothesis , the integral of @xmath4 over any such time - like curve does not depend on the choice of the curve , then the previous function is well - defined .    .",
    ", width=170 ]    before going any further , it is important to remark that @xmath11 is differentiable near @xmath125 . to see this",
    ", we explicitly compute @xmath11 in a normal coordinate system around @xmath125 .",
    "in such a coordinate system computing @xmath11 is not difficult since we can choose as the time - like curve @xmath22 joining @xmath125 and @xmath128 , with @xmath128 sufficiently near to @xmath125 , the unique time - like geodesic joining these points inside the normal neighborhood .",
    "then , since the coordinate expression of a geodesic in a normal coordinate system is given by a straight line in the direction of the initial velocity of the geodesic ( see , for example , @xcite ) , we can make an easy explicit computation for @xmath11 . doing this , we get the following : @xmath129    assuming @xmath4 to be smooth , it is clear that @xmath11 is differentiable near @xmath125 . from now",
    "on we will restrict @xmath11 to such a neighborhood of @xmath125 , so that we know that @xmath130 exists .",
    "consider now a neighborhood @xmath131 of @xmath128 such that @xmath132 and a time - like vector @xmath133 .",

    "we have shown that the eps original definition of proper time is equivalent to the definition proposed by v. perlick , even though the latter seems to be more easily motivated in the context of eps s axiomatic approach to space - time . after showing that perlick s notion leads to a well - defined and physically sensible definition of proper time in a general weyl space - time , without invoking any additional axioms",
    ", we proved that this kind of space - time exhibits a second clock effect .",
    "we then derived the condition a space - time must obey in order that a second clock effect does not appear .",
    "we have shown that in this case the geometric space - time structure should be that of a weyl integrable space - time .",
    "our final conclusion is that , within the slightly modified eps axiomatic approach , taking into account perlick s proper time , weyl integrable space - time appears naturally as the most general model for space - time .",
