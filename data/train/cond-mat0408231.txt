    "in a companion paper@xcite , we have presented a conformal mapping technique that allows us to map any 2d medium bounded by a rough boundary onto a half - plane .",
    "this method is based on the iterative use of fft transforms and is extremely fast and efficient provided that the local slope of the interface remains lower than one .",
    "when the maximum slope exceeds one this algorithm , similar in spirit to a direct iteration technique well suited to circular geometries@xcite , can no longer be used in its original form .",
    "underrelaxation@xcite suffices however to make it convergent for boundaries having large slopes . beyond the determination of a conformal mapping for a given rough interface we have also shown in ref.@xcite how to generate directly mappings onto self - affine rough interfaces of chosen roughness exponent .",
    "self - affine formalism is an anisotropic scaling invariance known to give a good description of real surfaces such as fracture surfaces@xcite .",
    "this statistical property of fracture surfaces is of great interest in the study of friction or transport processes in geological faults@xcite .",
    "building a conformal mapping is entirely equivalent to solving a harmonic problem with a uniform potential ( or field ) condition on the boundary .",
    "we used extensively this property in ref.@xcite to study stationary heat flows in the vicinity of a rough boundary and we focussed on the case of self - affine surfaces where we were able to compute the exact correlation between local surface field and height profile .",
    "we gave also a special emphasis to the problem of the location of the plane interface equivalent to the rough one at infinity .",
    "it turned out that the conformal mapping technique provides a very direct means of computing the shift between the plane equivalent interface and the mean plane of the rough interface .",
    "the range of applications of this first study naturally covers fields where laplace equation appears : electrostatics , concentration diffusion , antiplane elasticity ... in this second paper , we are specifically concerned with the case of bi - harmonic problems .",
    "the method we propose leads to the solution of the bi - harmonic field through the inversion of a linear system , as most other alternative numerical approaches ( e.g. boundary elements method , spectral method ... ) but in contrast to the latters , the linear system to invert is naturally well conditionned and of rather modest size ( n equations for n fourier modes in the conformal mapping method ) in contrast with direct spectral methods ( 4n unknowns ) .",
    "moreover , following the first step of our algorithm analytically allows to obtain systematic perturbation expansion results .    after recalling our main results about conformal mapping in the first section",
    ", we deal successively with two important examples of bi - harmonic problems : stokes flows and plane elasticity .",
    "the second section is thus devoted to the study of a stationary stokes ( _ i.e. _ low reynolds number ) flow close to a rough boundary .",
    "we shall also develop in this section the paradigm of the equivalent `` no - slip '' plane interface . in the third section we point out the problem of the stress distribution in a two - dimensional material bounded by a rough boundary and submitted to a uni - axial tension .",
    "the study of such situations is of particular interest for computing the influence of the roughness on the rupture probability law of brittle materials .",
    "we show that this problem is formally identical to that previously solved for the stokes flow .",
    "we pay further a special attention to the case of self - affine surfaces and we present in this section numerical results that suggest that for large stresses , the surface stress statistical distribution law presents a power law behavior .",
    "we recall here the essential results described in ref . @xcite .",
    "the aim of this section is to conformally map a half - plane onto a two - dimensional domain bounded by a rough interface .",
    "we first recall briefly how to build a conformal mapping well - suited to a given rough interface .",
    "this problem can be written under form similar as that of a `` theodorsen problem '' @xcite ; in the semi - infinite geometry we deal with , it can be solved with an iterative algorithm using fast fourier transforms @xcite .",
    "the second part of this section is focussed on the specific case of self - affine interfaces .",
    "it turns out , indeed , that very simple constraints on a conformal mapping allow to generate directly a two - dimensional domain bounded by a self - affine interface of chosen roughness exponent .",
    "this property is of particular interest in statistical studies .",
    "we could thus establish in ref.@xcite the correlation between the norm of a harmonic field at a self - affine interface and the height of this latter .      as illustrated in fig .",

    ". the coefficients @xmath87 are easily deduced from the @xmath85 .",
    "once the conformal mapping is known , the numerical resolution of the stokes equation just requires the inversion of the linear system .",

    "the latter method was recently used by tuck et kouzoubov @xcite . in the cited reference ,",
    "they use expansions in a basis of @xmath89 and write a linear system discretizing the rough interface in @xmath75 points .",
    "if this method is efficient in the small slope limit , it becomes however unpracticable for large slopes .",
    "the procedure requires thus the numerical inversion of a matrix consisting of terms of order @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the roughness amplitude and this becomes practically difficult or unprecise as soon as the product @xmath92 increases .",
    "the conformal mapping avoids such numerical difficulties since the boundary is plane in the equivalent domain .",

    "the stream lines closely follow the smooth interface ( fig .",
    "[ stokes1 ] ) while an eddy appears in the largest depression of the roughest interface ( fig .",
    "[ stokes2 ] ) .",
    "we now introduce the notion of an equivalent plane no - slip boundary in the framework of a stationary stokes flow .",
    "our aim is here to replace the no - slip condition on the rough boundary by a no slip condition on an equivalent plane boundary , the stream function remaining unchanged at infinity .",
    "let us recall that like in the case of a rough electrode which was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , nothing prescribes the plane equivalent boundary to lie at the average height of the rough one . in harmonic problems ,",
    "the dissymetry between peaks and cavities due to point effects leads the equivalent plane boundary to be shifted towards the peaks .",
    "we shall see in the following that the same conclusion holds in the case of the stationary stokes flow .",
    "an illustration of this disymmetry naturally emerges with the occurrence of little eddies in pronounced depressions of the rough boundary .",
    "we have chosen in this text to develop the paradigm of no - slip plane equivalent boundary but it is naturally also possible to consider a plane boundary fixed at the average plane with a roughness dependent slip boundary .",
    "the conclusion previously mentioned about the place of the equivalent boundary ( nearer from the peaks than from the cavities ) is then expressed by a reversal flow condition .",
    "we show in the following that the conformal mapping method gives a natural way to compute the vertical shift of the plane equivalent boundary .",
    "we compare these results with a perturbative solution that can be directly computed from the fourier coefficients of the interface .",

    "when we seek for the location of the plane equivalent electrode , we expect two different behaviors i ) a dependence on @xmath106 in case of small amplitude or low spatial frequency ii ) a linear dependence on @xmath91 in case of large amplitude or high spatial frequency .",
    "the latter behavior comes directly from the fact that the equivalent plane reaches at maximum the level of the highest peaks . in case of small slopes ,",
    "it is easy to show that the correction from the average plane is of order @xmath106 .",
    "the deviation @xmath59 is naturally normalized by the amplitude of roughness @xmath91 .",
    "the ratio @xmath107 has then to be a function of the two only characteristic lengths of the system , @xmath91 and @xmath29 and can be expanded in the limit of small slopes : @xmath108 a simple symmetry about the mean plane has to leave @xmath59 unchanged , since this symmetry is equivalent to a transformation of @xmath91 into @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 have to be zero and : @xmath112    a detailed perturbative analysis can be built in the case of a simple sine interface @xcite . writing a perturbative solution in the conformal mapping formalism allows us to deal with any rough interface . following ( [ phi(z ) ] )",

    ", we recover : @xmath120    it has to be noted these first order results are exactly identical to those obtained in the case of a rough electrode ( up to a factor 2 ) despite the fact we had here to solve a biharmonic equation instead of a simple harmonic one . on figures [ stokesequivsin ] and [ stokesequiv ] we have plotted both results of the perturbative solution and of the conformal mapping calculation in case of a sine interface and of a self affine interface of roughness exponent 0.8 built with 64 fourier modes .",
    "we check that the perturbative calculations correctly fit the results for small slopes ( up to 0.5 ) . for larger slopes ,",
    "the perturbative expression overestimates the deviation whose behavior becomes progressively linear .",
    "note that our numerical method allowed us to reach local slope values up to 2.5 .",
    "this maximum slope can be increased by using more fourier modes in the mapping function ( we used 256 modes in the present calculation ) .",
    "in this section , we analyse the effect of a slight surface roughness on the stress distribution in an elastic medium .",
    "we emphasize here the case of a semi - infinite material submitted to a uni - axial tension .",
    "although very elementary , this simple model illustrates an effect which has been suggested to be responsible for the mechanical strength of glass fibers .",
    "recent experimental results @xcite suggest that the nanometric roughness at the surface of glass fibers of diameter a few micrometers could be responsible for the decrease of the tensile resistance by a factor of about 5 .",
    "in uniaxial tension , the resistance of a fiber is directly related to the distribution of maximum positive principal stresses . using a simple perturbative expansion ,",
    "we show that in the limit of small slopes , the surface stress can be directly computed from the hilbert transform of the local slope .",
    "the weibull law @xcite usually gives a correct description of failure statistics in a wide range of brittle materials .",
    "this phenomenological law is partly based on the identification of the weakest link in the material ( whose size is supposed to be that of the smallest defects ) .",
    "we will see in the following that for a self - affine surface ( such as measured for glass fibers by afm techniques @xcite ) the statistical distribution of tensile stresses at the boundary displays a power law behavior , which naturally implies the validity of weibull statistical failure distribution .",
    "moreover the exponent of this power law , _",
    "i.e. _ the weibull modulus , continuously depends on the roughness amplitude .      in plane stress or plane strain conditions , the stress tensor @xmath121 $ ]",

    "this leads to : @xmath132 it turns out that the boundary condition at the interface is exactly the same as the one we have encountered for the no - slip condition in a stokes flow .",
    "the airy function is thus identical to the above derived stream function for stokes flow .",

    ", we find that the tangential surface stress deviation from its mean value is proportional to _ the hilbert transform of the local slope_. fig .",
    "[ cont01 ] and [ cont04 ] give two examples of stress distribution on surfaces of repectively maximum slope 0.1 and 0.4 .",
    "in both cases , we can see that the stress fluctuations are much greater than the height fluctuations ( which have been dilated by a factor 5 in the figures ) .",
    "note that ( taking into account the dilation of the height profile ) the stress fluctuations are very large compared with those of the height . in the context of rupture , the relevant parameter being the maximum stress , one can understand that a very modest roughness can be responsible for a dramatic decrease of the material resistance .",
    "we observe a good agreeement between the stress profile computed by conformal mapping and the perturbative result ( related to the hilbert transform of the slope ) for the smoothest interface but this is no longer the case for the roughest one especially in the area where the curvature is large .",
    "higher order perturbative terms are thus necessary to recover the actual stress .",

    "i.e. _ their fourier coefficients are @xmath135 where @xmath39 is a gaussian random variable of zero mean and unit standard deviation . in case of small slopes ,",
    "the validity of the first order perturbative result suggests thus that the stress distribution is gaussian . on fig .",

    "we have seen that the agreement between the first order perturbative results and the complete computation becomes poorer .",
    "we can then wonder if the log - normal behavior of the distribution is preserved . on fig .",
    "[ powerlaw ] , we have plotted the surface stress distribution for four self - affine surfaces of roughness exponent @xmath136 and of respective maximum slopes 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 and 0.8 . these results were obtained by averaging the data obtained from 1000 different surfaces each defined with 64 fourier modes .",
    "we can see a clear power law like behaviour for large stress amplitudes .",
    "the slopes we can measure are very dependent on the roughness amplitude .",
    "the interpretation of these new numerical results requires a perturbative analysis that we have not developed yet for this bi - harmonic problem .",
    "we have however performed a similar analysis in the case of a harmonic field on self - affine interfaces @xcite .",
    "it turned out that in a similar fashion as the one presented above , the field distribution law present a power law tail with an exponent @xmath137 where @xmath91 is the roughness amplitude , @xmath138 the spatial lower cut - off of the self - affine domain and @xmath30 the roughness exponent . calling @xmath139 the logarithm of the field ,",
    "the latter result was derived showing that the reduced variable @xmath140 follows a gaussian distribution ( @xmath141 for harmonic problems ) .",
    "using @xmath142 , we can check indeed ( see fig .",
    "[ collapse ] ) that all data obtained from our calculations collapse on a same parabola in log - log scale .",
    "these numerical results indicate that a same scaling applies for both harmonic and bi - harmonic fields on self - affine surfaces . a detailed analysis of these statistical properties will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "after introducing a conformal mapping technique that allowed for a detailed study of harmonic field in the vicinity of rough boundaries @xcite , we have extended in this paper the use of this method to the study of bi - harmonic fields .",
    "we have given a general solution to problems such that the stokes flow over a rough surface and the stress distribution in a medium ( bounded by a rough interface ) in uni - axial tension .",
    "besides the knowledge of the mapping function ( obtained using a simple iterative algorithm ) , this solution only requires the linear inversion of a well conditioned matrix .",
    "the determination of the mapping function being only limited by the maximum value of the local slope at the interface , the method is well suited to any kind of single - valued interface . as an illustration",
    ", we have thus presented results of stokes flow over self - affine boundaries whose maximum slope reach 2.5 . in the same context of a stokes flow over a rough boundary , we pay a special attention to the determination of the location of an equivalent no - slip plane interface .",
    "the conformal mapping method gives way to a very natural determination of this quantity .",
    "a simple perturbative solution allowed us to retrieve for it a result proposed by tuck and kouzoubov @xcite . in the context of the plane elasticity , the same perturbative result has allowed us to show that , in the limit of small slopes , the surface stress distribution was directly related to the hilbert transform of the slope of the interface .",
    "this very simple result could be used e.g. for the evolution of a stress - corrosion front .",
    "the analysis of statistical results for the principal stress on self - affine surfaces has shown moreover that the large stress distribution presents a power law tail whose exponent continuously depends on the roughness amplitude .",
    "such results could be applied in the context of glass fiber rupture statistics to provide a fundamental basis for the weibull law that is known to describe accurately the rupture statistics .",
    "a realistic description of these stress distributions require a second order perturbative analysis which will be presented in a futher study .",
    "we have , however , recently proposed such an approach in case of harmonic fields @xcite where distributions of the same kind have also been found and justified in two and three dimensions .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge enlightning discussions with f. creuzet , e.j .",
    "hinch and j.r .",
    "we are also grateful to b. forget and a. tanguy for useful help and comments .",
    "in this appendix we present the iterative scheme allowing us to build the conformal mapping @xmath143 for any given single valued rough interface . as exposed in ii.b , we are seeeking for a mapping function @xmath7 such that @xmath17 , where @xmath144 is the rough interface and @xmath145 is the x - axis . the single valued interface @xmath14 being associated to the real function @xmath15",
    ", this condition is rewritten : @xmath146    we build the algorithm in the following way : the intermediate quantities appearing at the @xmath37th iteration are labelled with a superscript @xmath147 , all functions are decomposed over a set of @xmath148 discrete values , the number of fourier modes is thus limited to @xmath148 .",
    "we first introduce a series of sampling points @xmath149 with @xmath150 which is initially set to an arithmetic series @xmath151 .",
    "the sampling of @xmath19 by the @xmath149 gives the array : @xmath152 the discrete fourier transform of this array is the complex valued array @xmath153 for @xmath154 .",

    "the form of @xmath165 is dictated by eq.([eqboom]a ) for positive index , and from the fact that the inverse fourier transform of @xmath166 ( see below ) is real .",

    "we note this step @xmath169 .",
    "the searched function @xmath7 is clearly a fixed point of the transformation @xmath170 defined above in a discretized version .",
    "the uniqueness of the transformation @xmath7 results from that of the harmonic field in the domain @xmath3 with an equipotential condition on the boundary and a constant gradient perpendicular to the boundary at infinite distance from it . therefore",
    ", the only condition to consider is the stability of the fixed point . as it can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , this fixed point is attractive at the only condition that : @xmath171 the procedure described above gives a very fast and efficient way of building conformal mappings .",
    "it has to be noted indeed that this two - dimensional problem is solved here by the only use of a few one - dimensional fast fourier transforms . in cases of slopes locally overcoming one , it is possible to use under - relaxation schemes ( see details in ref .",
