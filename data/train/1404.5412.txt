    "an overlay - inband d2d communications scheme is assumed , where d2d transmissions are performed on an exclusively assigned part of the available spectrum .",

    "all d2d txs transmit with the same fixed power , normalized to unity , and ( thermal ) noise power at rxs is assumed negligible compared to interference .      in order to control the interference level ,",
    "the dedicated bandwidth for d2d transmissions is partitioned into @xmath24 subchannels ( scs ) of equal size and each d2d tx transmits in only one of them ( the possibility of one sc used by many d2d links is allowed ) .",

    "however , a ( small ) possibility of having excessively many nearby d2d txs using the same sc still exists , as it may happen that close - by txs located near the common edge of adjacent cells are assigned the same sc .",

    "therefore , they can not be claimed to be ppp and their actual distribution must be derived , which is a difficult task . on the other hand ,",
    "the semi - random manner under which coordinated scheduling is performed suggests that this correlation is small and , therefore , the following approximation is expected to be accurate .",

    "proposition 1 provides some initial insights on the interference levels provided by coordinated scheduling in terms of density of interferers .",
    "in particular , the interferers density outside @xmath55 is the same as in the uncoordinated case , i.e. , coordination does not provide any benefit in this respect , which is not surprising as scheduling decisions are taken independently per cell . on the other hand",
    ", coordination manages to reduce the density of intra - cell interferers as it can be directly verified that @xmath87 .",

    "unfortunately , @xmath55 is a convex polyhedron @xcite which makes even numerical evaluation of ( [ eq : l_i_in ] ) impractical .",
    "clearly , a simple approximation of @xmath55 is required and it is natural to consider a circular shape area whose radius depends on the distance @xmath91 between the typical d2d rx and ap @xmath54 .",

    "@xmath94 is chosen as a conservative approximation of @xmath55 , since @xmath95 @xcite and the typical d2d is placed right on its edge .",
    "approximation @xmath96 attempts to remedy the latter issue by covering the typical d2d tx from all sides .",
    "it can be easily seen that neither approximation will be a good fit for all realizations of @xmath22 .",
    "however , they do allow for a computationally tractable expression of the sir distribution under coordinated scheduling , conditioned on @xmath55 , or , equivalently , on @xmath91 .",
    "[ prop]proposition    under assumptions 1 - 3 , the ccdf of sir with coordinated scheduling and conditioned on the distance @xmath97 is given by ( 9 ) ( shown at the top of the page ) , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , under the approximation @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , under the approximation @xmath105 .",
    "starting from ( [ eq : sir ] ) , @xmath106 where the last equation follows from ( [ eq : i2 ] ) and lemma 2 . using the laplace transform formula of lemma 3 , replacing @xmath55 with one of the approximations in assumption 3 and writing the integrals in polar coordinates results in ( 9 ) .",

    "in addition , it can be easily seen that it is non - negative for any @xmath91 , which , after comparing with ( [ eq : adhoc_cov ] ) , shows that the sir under coordinated scheduling stochastically dominates sir under uncoordinated scheduling , i.e. , coordinated scheduling provides at least as good performance as uncoordinated scheduling in terms of sir .    in order to obtain an @xmath91-independent sir distribution the statistics of @xmath91 must be determined . for small @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath91 is close to the distance between @xmath36 and @xmath54 whose distribution is known @xcite , suggesting the following approximation .",
    "[ as]assumption    distance @xmath91 is rayleigh distributed with @xmath108 .",
    "the unconditioned sir distribution can now be obtained by simple averaging .    under assumptions 1 - 4 ,",
    "the ccdf of sir with coordinated scheduling equals @xmath109 with @xmath110 as in ( 9 ) .",
    "in order to assess the accuracy of the analytical results for the coordinated case , simulations were performed assuming @xmath111 , @xmath112 , which corresponds to an average of 10 d2d txs ( links ) per cell . in each simulation run , a realization of @xmath22 and @xmath35 was generated in an area of size large enough to include 30 aps on average and the sir of the typical link was measured .",
    "the results depicted were obtained by averaging over @xmath113 independent runs with the value of @xmath114 set to @xmath115 .",
    "figure 2 shows the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of sir under coordinated scheduling with @xmath116 ( recall that the average distance between typical d2d tx and closest ap is @xmath117 ) .",
    "note that there are on average @xmath118 d2d txs located closer to the typical d2d rx than the typical d2d tx .",
    "performance for various @xmath24 is depicted , as obtained by simulations as well as the analytical expression of corollary 1 .",
    "in addition , the performance of uncoordinated scheduling ( lemma 1 ) is also shown without corresponding simulation results as ( [ eq : adhoc_cov ] ) is exact .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath50 , performance is extremely poor due to large interference , whereas @xmath119 provides significant performance improvement .",
    "the analytical expression for the sir is very close to the simulation results under the approximation @xmath105 , whereas approximation @xmath101 gives a conservative estimate ( upper bound ) of performance that is nevertheless tighter than the upper bound provided by the uncoordinated performance .",
    "coordinated scheduling outperforms uncoordinated scheduling as predicted by the analytical results providing a @xmath120 and @xmath121 db gain with @xmath122 , @xmath123 , respectively , for an outage probability of @xmath124 .",
    "since the concept of d2d communications relies on taking advantage of the proximity between communicating devices , it is of interest to examine performance as a function of d2d link distance @xmath23 .",
    "figure 3 shows the outage probability @xmath125 for sir values @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 db , and @xmath122 , as a function of @xmath23 , under coordinated scheduling ( simulation and analytical results ) as well as under uncoordinated scheduling .",
    "it can be seen , that , in both cases , outage probability increases with @xmath23 and @xmath129 .",
    "coordinated scheduling always outperforms uncoordinated scheduling with most significant gains for values of @xmath23 up to about @xmath130 .",
    "note that the analytical results are very close to the simulation results for this range of @xmath23 .",
    "larger values of @xmath23 result in diminishing the gain offered by coordination , which is actually eliminated completely for very large @xmath23 .",
    "this is due to d2d txs and corresponding rxs residing in different cells , which is also the reason why analytical results become inaccurate for very large @xmath23 since assumptions 1 and 4 no longer hold .",
    "however , this is not a serious shortcoming as this region of operation ( very large @xmath23 ) is not of interest for d2d communications .",
    "although sir performance can be improved by increasing @xmath24 , this comes at a cost of reduced bandwidth utilization , which suggests that @xmath24 must be optimized according to some rate - related criterion . to this end , the analytical expressions of sec .",
    "iii can be employed for an efficient numerical search of the optimal @xmath24 . as an application ,",
    "the following simple case study is considered that provides some insights on the benefits of d2d communications as overlay to the downlink of a cellular network .    in particular , consider the presence of cellular rxs , i.e. , rxs whose data are generated from sources that can not allow for d2d communication , with locations modeled as an independent homogeneous ppp @xmath131 of density @xmath132 .",
    "these rxs are served by their closest ap via a simple time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) scheduling scheme , with all aps in the system transmitting with the same power .",
    "the sir threshold model for achieved rates is considered , i.e. , a spectral efficiency of @xmath133 bits / hz per channel use is achieved as long as the connection sir is above a threshold @xmath129 .    assuming a common sir threshold for both cellular and d2d communications , the average user rate , taking into account the effects of tdma for cellular users and @xmath119 for d2d communications , is defined as @xmath134 where @xmath135 , @xmath136",

    "the distribution of @xmath137 and @xmath139 have been exactly computed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 is a function of @xmath142 , @xmath24 and @xmath23 that can be optimized with the analytical formulas for @xmath140 of sec .",

    "it can be seen that introducing d2d communications to the system enhances the average user rate for values of @xmath23 up to about @xmath148 of the average distance from the closest ap , above which d2d communications perform worse than cellular and contribute negatively to the average user rate .",
    "this maximum distance suggests design guidelines , e.g. , on the device - discovery training sequence / power , so as not to allow establishment of d2d links of distance greater than this threshold .",
    "it can also be seen that coordinated scheduling outperforms uncoordinated scheduling , and allows for about @xmath149 increased maximum allowed d2d link distance .",
    "the advantage of coordinated scheduling would be greater if reliability constraints , e.g. , on sir , were considered .",
