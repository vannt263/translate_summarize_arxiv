    "the success of the rapidly developing field of spectroscopy of doped helium ( he ) nanodroplets is based on applying ever new laser techniques as they become available .",
    "such studies are motivated on the one hand by the unique properties of he nanodroplets which make them a nearly ideal spectroscopic matrix  @xcite .",
    "the small size , low temperature , the superfluid state as well as the inertness with respect to light absorption and to chemical reactivity makes he nanodroplets a suitable environment for high resolution spectroscopic studies of isolated atoms , molecules , aggregates and clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "the guest - host interactions between the dopant atoms or molecules and the he droplets are being studied for their own interest , in particular for probing superfluidity on the nanoscale .",
    "he droplets constitute indeed an extremely weakly perturbing environment as far as dopant molecules in their electronic ground state are concerned",
    ". however , upon electronic excitation or ionization of the dopants , strong interactions with the he may induce considerable spectroscopic shifts and broadenings  @xcite .",
    "the he then turns from an inert substrate into an active reaction partner which facilitates the formation of he containing molecules ( exciplexes )  @xcite , ionic complexes ( snowballs )  @xcite and even nanoplasmas  @xcite .",
    "exciplexes consisting of one excited alkali ( ak ) metal atom ak@xmath2 and one or a few he atoms formed on he nanodroplets have been extensively studied spectroscopically and more recently by means of photoionization mass spectrometry and ion imaging techniques  @xcite .",
    "the structure and spectra of ak@xmath2he exciplexes have been investigated theoretically using various techniques  @xcite . while the equilibrium properties of exciplexes are now well characterized even including an environment given by a he cluster or film , the dynamics of the formation process of ak@xmath2he exciplexes still eludes from an accurate description .",
    "one reason for the difficulty of measuring exciplex formation times is related to the location of ak dopants on the surface of he nanodroplets in shallow dimple states  @xcite . upon laser excitation",
    ", the excited ak@xmath2 generally tends to desorb off the droplet surface due to repulsive forces acting between the ak@xmath2 atom and the he droplet as a whole  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the situation of attractive ak@xmath2-he pair interactions the dynamics initiated by laser absorption is likely to be determined by the competition between the dissociation of the ak@xmath2he@xmath3 complex and the formation of the ak@xmath2he@xmath4 exciplex molecules , where @xmath5 and he@xmath3 denotes the he droplet . for the case of rubidium",
    "exciplexes rb@xmath2he formed in the second excited electronic state @xmath6 , though , a weakly bound configuration on the he surface was predicted  @xcite . the fact that in the experiment rb@xmath2he exciplexes have been observed as desorbed free molecules was rationalized by droplet - induced vibrational relaxation into lower vibrational levels thereby liberating enough energy for evaporating the rb@xmath2he off the droplet surface  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the formation of sodium and potassium exciplexes ( na@xmath2he , k@xmath2he ) has first been studied by time - resolved emission spectroscopy , yielding formation times in the range of tens of ps  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the k@xmath2he and rb@xmath2he exciplex formation dynamics has been probed using femtosecond ( fs ) pump - probe techniques which revealed a rb@xmath2he signal rise time of 8.5ps  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models including one - dimensional semiclassical tunneling  @xcite , quantum - classical modeling  @xcite , semiclassical path integral molecular dynamics  @xcite , and quantum monte carlo approaches  @xcite have predicted values for the exciplex formation times ranging from 1.7ps for lithium - helium li@xmath2he , to 31ps for rb@xmath2he in the @xmath6 state .    recently , new insights have been gained from ion imaging experiments with he droplets doped with na .",
    "depending on the electronic state to which the nahe@xmath3 complex is excited , qualitatively different velocity distributions of the desorbing na@xmath2he and na@xmath2he@xmath7 exciplexes as compared to the neat na atom were observed  @xcite .",
    "the isotropic velocity distribution of na@xmath2he measured upon excitation to the @xmath6 state points to an indirect desorption process which is possibly driven by droplet - induced vibrational relaxation and thus akin to statistical evaporation .    in the present work we study the formation of rb@xmath2he exciplexes initiated by exciting rb - doped he droplets to the @xmath6 state of the rb@xmath2he@xmath3 complex by means of a new time - resolved spectroscopic approach . using a fs pulse shaper for amplitude shaping one of the two identical fs pulses we realize a pump - probe scheme where the first pump pulse is ultrashort ( 200fs ) and broadband ( 75@xmath8 ) and the time delayed probe pulse is stretched to @xmath9ps using a pulse shaper which acts as a tunable spectral band - pass filter with a band width of @xmath10@xmath8 . in this way",
    ", we can resolve the vibrational spectrum of rb@xmath2he and follow its evolution on the picosecond ( ps ) up to nanosecond ( ns ) time scales .",
    "surprisingly , we find that a redistribution of the spectral line intensity proceeds as long as 1.7ns after the pump pulse .",
    "this points to the rb@xmath2he exciplexes being formed within a few ps and then remaining at least partly attached to the droplet surface and slowly relaxing into low vibrational states during hundreds of ps .",
    "a similar relaxation dynamics was previously observed with rb@xmath7 , rb@xmath11 , na@xmath11 , and k@xmath11 attached to he droplets  @xcite .",

    "the cell temperature is kept at @xmath17c which corresponds to the maximum pick up probability for single rb atoms .",
    "the latter was determined by recording resonant ionization yields of rb@xmath18 as a function of cell temperature .",
    "further downstream , the beam of doped droplets intersects the focused laser beam at right angle inside the detection volume of a commercial quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) . for beam analysis purposes , a langmuir - taylor ( lt ) detector",
    "is attached to the end of the beam line  @xcite .",

    "the pulses have a duration of about 200fs and a full spectral bandwidth at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 75@xmath8 .",
    "pairs of time delayed pulses with equal intensity are generated by a mach - zehnder interferometer . the new part in the present experiment is the addition of a femtosecond pulse shaper which is inserted into one arm of the interferometer .",
    "the pulse shaper consists of a liquid crystal based spatial light modulator with 640pixels ( jenoptik slm s640d ) placed in the fourier plane of a @xmath20-zero - dispersion compressor  @xcite .        in the presented experiments we apply pure amplitude shaping with a square transmission function which has a width of 7 pixels which corresponds to a fwhm bandwidth of the modulated pulses of 9.1@xmath8 .",

    "we indeed find that the vibrational population continues to relax towards the ground state even after delay times as long as 1.7ns .    as an alternative mechanism that may induce the observed slow relaxation we have considered the fast desorption of rb@xmath2he exciplexes followed by inelastic collisions with evaporating he atoms .",

    "as such a strong anisotropy in the evaporation appears highly implausible , we tend to rule out this scenario .",
    "the formation and relaxation process of rb@xmath2he exciplexes initiated by the excitation of rb atoms on the surface of he nanodroplets has been studied using femtosecond pump and picosecond probe spectroscopy .",
    "the picosecond probe pulse is obtained by amplitude shaping of a femtosecond pulse and is individually tuned within the bandwidth of the femtosecond laser at variable delay times .",
