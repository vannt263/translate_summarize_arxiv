    "tully - fisher ( 1977 ; tf hereafter ) luminosity - linewidth studies frequently exploit the tf relation as a secondary distance indicator . as the fundamental scaling relation for spiral galaxies , the tf relation also provides constraints on galaxy formation ; it is deeply connected to the processes by which disk galaxies form ( e.g. , cole et al . 1994 ; eisenstein & loeb 1996 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; mo & mao 2000 ) . by allowing comparisons of galaxies at high @xmath4 to _",

    "the fundamental plane relations are indispensable for establishing a complete picture of galaxy evolution .",
    "kinematic estimates are frequently necessary for ascertaining the masses of galaxies . for example , the faint , compact , blue galaxies may be small , starbursting galaxies that will eventually fade or larger galaxies with only moderate amounts of star formation ( koo et al . 1994 , 1995 ;",
    "kobulnicky & zaritsky 1999 ) . only kinematic linewidths that truly reflect the masses of these galaxies would resolve the degeneracy .",

    "the size of these studies will increase and an understanding of the underlying physics will be crucial . until now , the primary goal of large tf studies has been construction of the tightest relation possible for use as a distance indicator ; thus most local tf studies are limited in morphology , excluding galaxies with signs of interaction and/or tidal distortion ( e.g. , rubin et al . 1985 ; pierce & tully 1992 ; willick et al .",

    "pruning of high-@xmath4 tf samples is more difficult because interactions are more frequent and the signatures of interaction are not so readily observable .",
    "low surface brightness companions , minor merger remnants embedded in larger galaxies , and faint tidal features can fall below the detection limits .",
    "seeing effects obscure both morphological and kinematic distortion .",
    "the desired measurement of luminosity evolution may become confused by the effects of tidal distortion on the measurements of the galaxy parameters .",
    "thus , high - redshift studies must rely on knowledge of the statistical effects of interactions gleaned from low - redshift studies .",
    "the tf relation has not yet been extensively studied as a means of detecting evolution .",
    "we consider the slope of the tf relation and the outliers to the distribution , in addition to the zero - point offset , as fundamental tools for characterizing luminosity evolution and morphological evolution .",
    "we explore the tf properties of 90 galaxies in the barton , geller , & kenyon ( 2000a ; bgk hereafter ) sample of galaxies in close pairs and n - tuples . because bgk find the distinct signature of increased star formation due to interactions , the bgk sample provides an ideal testing ground for the use of the tf relation to detect moderate luminosity evolution .",
    "we lay the groundwork for future tf studies of high - reshift galaxies by : ( 1 ) quantifying the effects of moderate distortion on the , intercept , slope and outliers of the tf relation , and ( 2 ) setting limits on the ability of pre- or non - merger interaction to initiate luminosity evolution off the tf relation at the current epoch .",

    "the nominal magnitude limit of the cfa2 redshift survey , m@xmath15 , corresponds to an absolute magnitude m@xmath16 at the largest redshift in the sample ( @xmath17 ) .    in spite of the m@xmath18 cutoff ,",
    "the pair sample contains numerous galaxies with m@xmath19 .",
    "these systems were often recorded in the cgcg ( zwicky 1961 - 1968 ) with the zwicky magnitude of the whole system , rather than with separate magnitudes for each of the galaxies .",
    "eighteen ( of 90 ) galaxies ( 20% ) in the tf sample have m@xmath19 , where m@xmath20 is the total @xmath6 magnitude ( see sec .",

    "2.4 describes the corrections for inclination and misalignment .",
    "we selected systems for rotation curve measurement based on the availability of h@xmath23 emission for the kinematic measurements ; this subsample favors h@xmath23-emitting galaxies and spirals with inclinations @xmath24 ( see bgk ) .",
    "we exclude some of the most distorted galaxies in pairs , typically if they no longer appear to have a disk .",

    "selection biases play an important role in any tf study .",
    "however , apart from our deliberate selection of galaxies in ( resolved ) pairs or tight systems , most tf studies share our most important biases : ( 1 ) we favor systems with substantial line emission , necessary to measure optical rotation curves , ( 2 ) our magnitude - limited sample includes intrinsically faint galaxies only if they are nearby , and ( 3 ) we include only disk galaxies",
    ". therefore , the effects of interactions should explain any significant differences between the tf properties of our sample and reference samples .",

    "we construct synthetic cross - correlation templates based on median linewidths and relative heights throughout each observing run .",
    "the technique is straightforward to implement and yields well - defined errors that enlarge in the presence of multiple velocity components or low signal - to - noise data .",

    "we sky - subtract and measure magnitudes and surface brightness profiles using the galphot package , originally written for surface photometry by freudling ( 1993 ) , and updated by n. grogin ( see grogin & geller 1999 ) to overlay fitted @xmath6-band isophotes onto @xmath0-band images . on both the @xmath6 and @xmath0 images",
    ", we measure the sky level in boxes placed around the galaxy or pair .",
    "we blank out stars on or around the galaxies using the * imedit * task in the images package .    with galphot tasks , which make use of several tasks in the isophote package , we fit the remaining ( good ) data on the @xmath6 images with isophotal ellipses . when the signal - to - noise ratio fades in the outskirts of each galaxy",
    ", we fix the center , position angle and ellipticity based on the inner isophotal ellipses .",
    "assuming symmetry within the isophotal ellipses ( sometimes not a well - justified assumption ) the * sphot * driver task in galphot constructs a model for the `` blanked - out '' data , and `` cleans '' the image with this model . on rare occasions ,",
    "when the galaxies are very far from axisymmetric , we use the * imedit * task to interpolate locally over stars . in either case",

    "our study focuses on interacting galaxies ; therefore , several systems are either highly disturbed or contain overlapping galaxies .",
    "our methods of dealing with these systems vary from system to system . in general , we fit ellipses where possible , sometimes smoothing the image for fitting purposes , but we fix the ellipse parameters if necessary . when galaxies overlap , but the individual galaxies are roughly elliptically symmetric , we derive magnitudes iteratively .",
    "we blank out one of the galaxies , fit the second galaxy , subtract the model for the second galaxy , and fit the first again . for most systems , this procedure is sufficient , but in some cases we continue to iterate until the model subtraction appears adequate . in the worst few cases ,",
    "when galaxies overlap and are not symmetric , we arbitrarily divide the flux between the galaxies .",
    "we calibrate the images using landolt ( 1992 ) standard fields .",
    "when possible , we calibrate long exposures directly .",
    "however , we observed most of the systems on mildly to moderately cloudy nights .",
    "we calibrate these data using short exposures on photometric nights .",
    "we calculate photometric offsets with the available stars on the frame .",
    "photometric errors vary from system to system .",
    "the most important factors are : ( 1 ) the calibration procedure , and ( 2 ) galaxy overlap .",
    "a small number of repeat observations ( on non - photometric nights , calibrated with the same short photometric exposure ) suggest that the photometric differences between images average @xmath10.03  magnitudes and are @xmath31 magnitudes ( with a few outliers ) .",
    "the rms scatter of standard stars on nominally photometric nights ( or half - nights ) satisfies @xmath32  magnitudes .",
    "the rms scatter in the calibration from shorter exposures falls in the range of @xmath33 , leading to errors in the offsets ( sigmas of the mean ) of 0.002  ",
    "0.015 magnitudes .",
    "the additional errors in the magnitudes due to significant overlap of paired galaxies can sometimes be @xmath34 magnitudes . finally , bright stars nearby on the frame can add errors due to poor background subtraction .",
    "4.3 explores the effects of some of these errors .",
    "we compare our pair sample primarily to the tf study of courteau ( 1997 ; c97 hereafter ) , because he derives velocity measures from optical rotation curves of comparable quality and his sample is drawn from regions of quiet hubble flow , outside the cores of rich clusters .",
    "however , the c97 study uses the gunn @xmath35 filter ; our photometry is in @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we also consider the pierce & tully ( 1992 ; pt92 hereafter ) and tully & pierce ( 2000 ; tp00 hereafter ) radio @xmath6 and @xmath0 relations ; many high-@xmath4 tf studies use the pt92 @xmath6 relation as a reference distribution .",
    "the sample selection criteria differed for these three samples . unlike our sample which includes all types of disk galaxies ,",
    "the c97 sample consists of unbarred sb and sc galaxies in the ugc ( see courteau 1996 ) .",
    "courteau eliminates `` all peculiar and interacting galaxies '' ; he restricts the sample to inclinations between 55@xmath36 and 75@xmath36 , and m@xmath37 as for our sample . the sample tp92",
    "use for zero - point fitting includes 15 galaxies in the local group , the sculptor group , and the m81 group , with `` normal '' morphology and low extinction corrections ; 6 of these have reliable independent distance measurements .",
    "they restrict the sample to inclinations @xmath38 .",
    "tp92 include 32 galaxies from the ursa major cluster to derive the slope of the tf relation .",
    "finally , tp00 measure a tf slope from a magnitude - limited set of galaxies in clusters ( both barred and unbarred ) ; tp00 derive the zero point from a restricted set of 24 calibrators . in summary ,",
    "our selection criteria differ from the criteria applied by c97 , pt92 , and tp00 , but the major difference between our sample and the c97 , tp92 , and tp00 samples is that we include only galaxies in close pairs .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss measurements of the tf parameters .",
    "our goal is to minimize systematic differences in measurement techniques between our pair sample and other tf studies .",
    "therefore , we emulate as many of these previously published techniques as possible .",

    "following c97 we correct the @xmath41 isophotal magnitudes to total magnitudes ; in some cases , tidal distortion in the outer isophotes introduces uncertainties in the extrapolation .",
    "we compute internal reddening following c97 and galactic reddening from n@xmath42 , the hi column density .",
    "we compute the absolute magnitudes assuming the c97 value h@xmath43 .",
    "the magnitude errors we compute include : ( 1 ) @xmath44 photon noise ( from the signal and the sky ) , ( 2 ) a sky subtraction error of 15% of the sky @xmath2 , ( 3 ) 0.03 magnitudes added in quadrature for photometric calibration ( 0.05 if we calibrate off a shorter exposure ) , ( 4 ) 0.1 magnitudes added in quadrature for each case of galaxy overlap or significant interference from stars on the frame , ( 5 ) an error in galactic extinction of 20% of the correction , ( 6 ) an error in internal extinction based on the error in inclination and , ( 7 ) a distance error from a peculiar velocity assuming @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the error in the systemic ( galactocentric ) velocity of the galaxy and @xmath11 is the velocity separation between the galaxy and its neighbor ( or the member of its n - tuple with the smallest velocity separation ) .",

    "in distorted cases , we fit the function anyway ; we discuss the effects of this `` naive '' approach extensively in secs .  4 and 5 .",
    "we measure @xmath58 , the velocity width of the galaxy , by evaluating the difference in the rotation curve model velocities at radii of @xmath59 on either side of the galaxy .",
    "slit misalignment from the major axis is an issue for some galaxies ; for an optically and geometrically thin disk , misalignment reduces the measured velocity width by a factor : @xmath60^{-1/2 } , \\label{eqn : misalignment}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the angle of misalignment between the slit and the photometric major axis in the plane of the sky and @xmath51 is the inclination .",
    "we compute the corrected velocity , v@xmath62 , using c97 eqn .  4 plus the misalignment correction : @xmath63 where z is the ( galactocentric ) redshift of the galaxy .",

    "pt92 and tp00 apply somewhat different prescriptions for their parameter measurements .",
    "when we compare with their tf relations , we adjust our hubble constant and our measurements of inclination angle and internal extinction ( and the parameters these depend on ) to match the prescriptions in pt92 ( see also tully & fouqu 1985 ) and tp00 .",

    "even when we clip by 2@xmath2 , removing 14 of the galaxies , the pair tf slope steepens by @xmath10.32 , or @xmath95 .",

    "[ fig : zr ] shows the relationship between the @xmath6-band tf residual from the pierce & tully ( 1992 ) relation and the velocity width .",
    "the figure shows a clear systematic difference between the pierce & tully tf relation and the tf relation appropriate for the zaritsky & rix data .",
    "the tf residuals are correlated with the velocity width , w@xmath121 ; the correlation is highly significant  a spearman rank test indicates a likelihood of no correlation of p@xmath122 .",
    "panel a shows the correlation between the asymmetry parameter and the velocity width of the galaxy , which reflects a fundamental physical property of spiral galaxies  that low - mass galaxies are more asymmetric .",
    "this correlation is also significant ( p@xmath123 ) .",
    "finally , panel b shows the correlation zaritsky & rix report between the residual from the pierce & tully ( 1992 ) @xmath6 tf relation and the stellar asymmetry of the @xmath124-band light . _ the correlations in panels a and c give rise to the apparent correlation in panel b_. the solid line is the least - squares fit to the data points in panel b ; the dotted line coincident with the solid line is the combination of the fits in panels a and c. the scatters match well ( @xmath125 , @xmath126  km  s@xmath8 , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the slope of the fit in panel a ) . when we remove the systematic tf slope problem by fitting the correlation in panel c , the correlation between the tf residual and the asymmetry disappears ( p@xmath129 ) .    a false correlation between the tf residuals and a third parameter can arise only if the third parameter depends on @xmath81 and m. false correlations can have two distinct ( but related ) causes : systematic slope errors and selection effects .",
    "the zaritsky & rix example involves a systematic slope error . with the proper slope , this false correlation disappears .",
    "we address this concern in our study by testing for correlations using three different slopes : the c97 slope ( as measured by c97 ) , -6.36 , the non - outlier pairs slope derived with the willick ( 1994 ) technique , -5.58 , and the non - outlier pairs slope derived from direct least - squares fitting , -4.75 .",
    "the last two rows of table  [ tab : cmeasures ] show that using the steepest slope results in no correlation between the residuals and m@xmath73 and that using the shallowest slope results in no correlation between the residuals and @xmath81 .",
    "selection effects are more complicated ; they can give rise to false correlations if the third parameter combines with one or both of @xmath81 and m to influence sample selection .",
    "for example , we analyze the @xmath0-band tf relation for a @xmath6-selected sample of galaxies ( from the zwicky catalog ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath110 color influences the selection of intrinsically faint galaxies  faint red galaxies are absent from our sample . even without a correlation between the tf residual and the color of a galaxy , the sample selection results in a false correlation because of the scatter in the tf relation .",
    "`` underluminous '' red galaxies are underrepresented , and the blue galaxies will seem preferentially underluminous .",
    "in fact , we see no trend with color , suggesting that this effect is either very small or , more likely , that excess star formation cancels it . this bias would damp any tendency for blue galaxies to appear overluminous due to excess star formation .",
    "these arguments suggest that false third parameter correlations should have some distinguishable characteristics .",
    "a correlation may be false if it does nt persist for different slope values .",
    "in addition , a correlation is particularly suspicious if the third parameter is a strong function of both m and @xmath81 . in this case",
    ", the correlation may still be real , especially if it persists for multiple slope choices .",
    "( note , however , that if a third parameter / residual correlation _ is _ real , the third parameter should correlate with _ either _ m or @xmath81 , by definition , if the correlation is strong enough . )",
    "conversely , the failure to detect a correlation does not mean that it is entirely absent .",
    "both large scatter in the intrinsic tf distribution and a large scatter in the relationship between the third parameter and the residual associated with the parameter can mask the true correlation .",
    "we apply these arguments in the analysis below to distinguish between false and true correlations .      in this section ,",
    "we describe several statistics or measures , both discrete and continuous , which we use to test for correlations between the tf residuals and the amount of tidal and kinematic distortion and star formation in each galaxy .",
    "tables  [ tab : cmeasures ] and [ tab : dmeasures ] list the continuous and discrete statistics , respectively , which we describe below .",

    "the cosmological assembly of galaxies at very high redshift and the subsequent variations of the star formation rate as a function of redshift are constraints for galaxy evolution ( e.g. , kauffman & white 1993 ; somerville & primack 1999 ; kolatt et al .",

    "<S> we use optical rotation curves to investigate the @xmath0-band tully - fisher properties of a sample of 90 spiral galaxies in close pairs , covering a range of luminosities , morphological types , and degrees of tidal distortion . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies follow the tully - fisher relation remarkably well , with the exception of eight distinct @xmath13@xmath2 outliers . </S>",
    "<S> although most of the outliers show signs of recent star formation , gasdynamical effects are probably the dominant cause of their anomalous tully - fisher properties . </S>",
    "<S> four outliers with small emission line widths have very centrally concentrated line emission and truncated rotation curves ; the central emission indicates recent gas infall after a close galaxy - galaxy pass . </S>",
    "<S> these four galaxies may be local counterparts to compact , blue galaxies at intermediate redshift .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining galaxies have a negligible offset from the reference tully - fisher relation , but a shallower slope ( 2.6@xmath2 significance ) and a 25% larger scatter . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that triggered star formation is a significant contributor to the slope difference . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the non - outlier sample with measures of distortion and star formation to search for third parameter dependence in the residuals of the tf relation . </S>",
    "<S> severe kinematic distortion is the only significant predictor of tf residuals ; this distortion is not , however , responsible for the slope difference from the reference distribution .    because the outliers are easily removed by sigma clipping , we conclude that even in the presence of some tidal distortion , detection of moderate ( @xmath3 magnitudes in rest - frame @xmath0 ) luminosity evolution should be possible with high - redshift samples the size of this 90-galaxy study . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the tf relation , although difficult to measure , is as fundamental for quantifying luminosity evolution as the zero - point offset . </S>"
