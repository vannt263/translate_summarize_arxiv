    "among non - topological solitons which appear in @xmath3-symmetric scalar fields , objects existing even in flat spacetime are called q - balls @xcite , while objects supported by strong gravity are called boson stars @xcite .",
    "q - balls are typically supposed to be microscopic objects .",
    "it has been argued that q - balls generally exist in all supersymmetric extensions of the standard model and could play important roles in cosmology @xcite .",
    "for example , q - balls can be produced efficiently in the affleck - dine mechanism and could be responsible for baryon asymmetry @xcite and dark matter @xcite . as for the stability of q - ball in",
    "flat spacetime , analytic results were obtained under the thin - wall approximation @xcite and under the thick - wall approximation @xcite .",
    "a general criterion of stability was derived analytically by pacceti correia and schmidt @xcite : a q - ball is stable if and only if [ qw - condition ] < 0  , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the angular velocity of phase rotation and the q - ball charge , respectively . in general cases ,",
    "numerical calculation is necessary for having equilibrium solutions , and catastrophe theory @xcite is a useful tool for finding their stability .",
    "kusmatsev made a general argument that catastrophe theory can be applied to the investigation of molecules and solitons in various systems and found the criterion ( [ qw - condition ] )  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite catastrophe theory was applied to two typical models of q - balls to explore the stability for the whole parameter space , which includes the intermediate region between the thin - wall limit and thick - wall limit . in this paper , as well as in most of the previous works",
    ", stability means local stability , that is , stability against small perturbations .",
    "absolute stability of q - balls has been argued in @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "boson stars have been studied as astronomical objects which could also contribute to dark matter  @xcite .",
    "for example , axidilaton star of @xmath6 could account for a part of massive compact halo objects  @xcite .",
    "supermassive boson stars of @xmath7-@xmath8 have been discussed as an alternative to a black hole in the galaxy center  @xcite .",
    "if we consider the evolution of boson stars in scalar - tensor theories , they could have gravitational memory : the strength of the gravitational constant at formation time could still be effective @xcite . as for the stability analysis of boson stars ,",
    "catastrophe theory has also been used @xcite .",
    "we may note , in passing , that catastrophe theory has also been applied to the stability analysis of non - abelian black holes @xcite .",
    "although the difference in theory between q - balls and boson stars is solely the model parameters , the investigations of their properties have been carried out separately .",
    "this is because q - balls and boson stars have been discussed in different contexts of particle physics or astrophysics .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to obtain an unified picture of equilibrium solutions and their stability of q - balls and boson stars .",
    "our interest is essentially mathematical .",
    "however , gravitating q - balls , or q - stars , which are intermediate objects between q - balls in flat spacetime and boson stars , have also been discussed @xcite .",
    "therefore , an unified analysis of q - balls and boson stars is also important for the study of astrophysical models .",

    "the condition ( [ omega ] ) can not apply to gravitating solutions .",
    "actually , boson stars exist .",
    "however , as we shall show below , the criterion @xmath21 is valid even for gravitating q - balls and boson stars .",
    "let us discuss how we apply catastrophe theory to the present q - ball or boson star system .",
    "an essential point is to choose _ behavior variable_(_s _ ) , _ control parameter_(_s _ ) and a _ potential _ in the q - ball or boson star system appropriately .    in @xcite",
    "we argued that the total energy of the scalar field , e_d^3x\\{^2 ^ 22+()^22+v } , is appropriate for a _ potential _ because the variation of @xmath22 under fixed @xmath5 , @xmath23 , reproduces the equilibrium field equation ( [ fe ] ) .",
    "this is on the analogy of a _ potential _ in a mechanical system , where the potential @xmath24 is defined in such a way that @xmath25 at equilibrium points .",
    "a nontrivial issue in curved spacetime is the choice of the corresponding total energy since there are many definitions for total energy .",
    "however , we can conclude that the hamiltonian energy @xmath26 , which we shall calculate below , is the appropriate because @xmath27 , reproduces the equilibrium field equations ( [ gtt])-([box ] ) .    from the lgrangian ( [ sg ] ) with the coordinate system ( [ metric1 ] ) , one finds the canonical momentum of @xmath28 and the matter part of the hamiltonian density , _",

    "we obtain _",
    "= \\{^2 ^ 22 ^ 2+()^22a^2+v } _ .",
    "similarly , we can consider the canonical momentum of the spatial metric @xmath30 and the gravity part of the hamiltonian density , ^ij=_g_ij , _ g&=&^ijh_ij - l_g = -&=&8g\\{g^t_t+1r^2a(r^2a) } , where we have used the static condition , @xmath31 .",
    "using one of the field equations , @xmath32 , we obtain the total hamiltonian , [ h ] ed^3x(h_g+h _ ) = _ rr^22ga .",

    "in curved spacetime , on the other hand , the normalized gravitational constant @xmath37 is another _ control parameter _ , which represents the strength of gravity .    to discuss a _ behavior variable _ we consider an one - parameter family of perturbed field configurations @xmath38 near the equilibrium solution @xmath39 . because @xmath40/dx=(\\delta e/\\delta\\phi_x)d\\phi_x / dx= 0 $ ] when @xmath41 is an equilibrium solution , @xmath42 is a _",
