    "in this report , we investigate vector mesons electroproduction at small bjorken @xmath0 on the basis of the gpd approach @xcite . at large @xmath1 the leading order amplitude with longitudinal photon and vector meson polarization ( ll amplitude ) dominates and factorizes @xcite into a hard meson leptoproduction off partons and gpds , fig.1 .",
    "other transition amplitudes are suppressed by powers of @xmath2 and obey singularities @xcite in the collinear approximation .",
    "this leads to the problems with factorization of these amplitudes .    in this report , we analyse ll amplitude of vector meson electroproduction at large @xmath1 . in contrast to @xcite , where the gluon predominant region @xmath3 was considered , we extend here our analysis to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this range covers the energy region from hermes to hera energies .",
    "our model is based on the modified perturbative approach ( mpa ) @xcite which includes the quark transverse degrees of freedom accompanied by sudakov suppressions .",
    "the transverse quark momentum regularizes the end - point region of the amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath5 range study requires inclusion of the sea and valence quark gpds in our analysis .",
    "it is shown , that in our model we obtain a fair description of hermes , h1 and zeus data @xcite for electroproduced @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons at small @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the parton contribution to the photoproduction amplitudes @xmath8 with positive proton helicity reads as a convolution of the hard subprocess amplitude @xmath9 and a large distance unpolarized @xmath10 and polarized @xmath11 parton gpds : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the gluon and quark contribution , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the helicity of the photon ( meson ) , @xmath16 is the momentum fraction of the parton with helicity @xmath17 , and the skewness @xmath18 is related to bjorken-@xmath0 by @xmath19 .",
    "the flavor factors are @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the polarized gpds @xmath22 at small @xmath0 are much smaller than the unpolarized gpds @xmath23 and they are unimportant in the analysis of the cross section .    the subprocess amplitude @xmath9 is represented as the contraction of the hard part @xmath24 which is calculated perturbatively and the non - perturbative meson wave function @xmath25 which depends on the transverse quark momenta @xmath26 in the vector meson @xmath27 the wave function is chosen in the simple gaussian form @xmath28}\\ , , \\ ] ] which leads after integration over @xmath26 to the asymptotic wave function . here",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 is the decay coupling constant and the @xmath31 parameter determines the value of average transverse momentum of the quark .    in calculation of the subprocess within the mpa",
    "@xcite we keep the @xmath32 terms in the denominators of the hard amplitudes .",
    "the gluonic corrections in hard subprocess are treated in the form of the sudakov factors which additionally suppress the end - point integration regions .",
    "the gpd is a complicated function which depends on three variables .",
    "we use the double distribution form @xcite @xmath33 with the distribution function @xmath34^{n_i } }                            { ( 1-|\\beta|)^{2n_i+1}}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are ordinary gluon and quark pdfs .",
    "for the parton distribution the simple regge ansatz is used @xmath38 the parameter @xmath39 is connected with the corresponding regge trajectory .",
    "for example , for gluon we have @xmath40 which determines the behavior of the gluon distribution at low @xmath0 and the energy dependence of the cross section at high energies .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 in ( [ gd ] ) is a slope of the regge trajectory @xmath42 .",
    "the other parameters in ( [ gd ] ) are taken from comparison with the cteq6 m parameterization  @xcite .",
    "the valence quark sea differs from the strange sea .",
    "the simple model is used @xmath43 which is in correspondence with the cteq6 results .",
    "the flavor symmetry breaking factor is chosen in the form @xmath44 which fits well cteq6 m pdfs .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     at hermes energies @xmath45 the valence quarks contribution is important . for @xmath6 production the interference of valence quarks with gluons and sea contribution give of about 40% contribution to the cross section at @xmath45 . at compass energies",
    "@xmath46 the valence quarks give only about 10% contribution to the cross section .",
    "thus , compass physics is very close to asymptotic hera energies .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath47 cross sections at hera energies @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "it is obvious that if the valence quark sea does not contribute ( or sea is symmetric ) , this ratio is determined by the flavor factors in ( [ amptt - nf - ji ] ) and should be equal to @xmath49 .",
    "the hera data show a strong deviation of this ratio from @xmath50 value . in our model , this violation at hera energies and low @xmath1 finds a natural explanation by the flavor symmetry breaking factor ( [ kappas ] ) effect . at high @xmath1",
    "the @xmath51 factor goes to 1 and the ratio of the cross section is close to the @xmath49 limit .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the @xmath1 dependence of the @xmath52 ratio is completely determined by the flavor symmetry breaking factor @xmath51 .",
    "it can not be explained if one does not consider the quark sea contribution . at hermes energies",
    "the valence quarks contribution in @xmath6 production gives an additional suppression the of @xmath52 ratio -see fig . 4b .",
    "we have analyzed electroproduction of light mesons at small bjorken-@xmath0 in the handbag model where the process amplitudes are factorized into the gpds and a partonic subprocess .",
    "the subprocess was calculated @xcite within the modified perturbative approach where the transverse momenta of the quark and antiquark as well as sudakov corrections were taken into account .",
    "these effects suppress the contributions from the end - point regions where one of the partons entering into the meson wave function becomes soft and factorization breaks down in the collinear approximation .",
    "it is found that the gpd approach gives a fine description of the longitudinal cross section for light meson production .",
    "the power corrections @xmath53 in propagators of the hard amplitude play an extremely important role at low @xmath1 .",
    "inclusion of these corrections gives a possibility to describe experimental data properly .",
    "the gluonic contribution plays an essential role for all energies @xmath54 in vector meson electroproduction .",
    "the gluon - sea interference is about 30(50)% for @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) production .",
    "valence quarks contribute only for @xmath55 . for the @xmath6 production at hermes energies @xmath56 , valence",
    "quarks give about 40% effect in the cross section . at compass @xmath57",
    "their contribution is about 10% only .",
    "the flavor symmetry breaking of the sea naturally explain the deviation of the @xmath52 ratio from the asymptotic limit equal to 2/9 at hera energies at low @xmath1 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that in different energy ranges , information about quark and gluon gpds can be extracted from the cross section of the vector meson electroproduction .",
    "this reaction at small @xmath0 and large @xmath1 is an excellent tool to study the gluon and quark gpds .",
