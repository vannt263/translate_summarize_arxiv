    "the recent renaissance of experiments to study the spectroscopy of light hadrons is partly driven by the goal to understand confinement . any analysis of experimental data requires both a calculation of decay widths as well as the masses@xcite .",
    "although computing the masses of resonances is ( currently ) not part of the program to compute `` gold plated '' observables with high precision from lattice qcd , dealing with decay widths is an inherent part of studying hadrons which are under current experimental scrutiny , such as `` exotics '' , and gluonic components of scalar mesons .",
    "here we compute the coupling of the @xmath3 meson to two pions to validate our procedure .",
    "one limitation of the lattice approach to qcd is in exploring hadronic decays because the lattice , using euclidean time , has important contributions from low lying thresholds  @xcite which can obstruct the study of decay widths .",
    "the finite spatial size of the lattice implies that two - body states are actually discrete . by measuring their energy very precisely as the spatial volume is varied",
    ", it is possible  @xcite to extract the scattering phase shifts and hence decay properties . for on - shell transitions , it is possible to estimate hadronic transition strengths more directly and this approach has been used to explore  @xcite hybrid meson decay rates . here",
    "we explore this approach further for the case of @xmath3 meson decay to @xmath4 , following ref .",
    "the situation we shall analyse is represented by the energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.rpp ] , here neglecting any interactions among the states",
    ". we evaluate correlations between lattice operators creating both a @xmath3 meson and a @xmath4 state , using a stochastic method to evaluate the quark diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.quark ] from 20 gauge configurations  @xcite ( double the number used in our initial calculation ) with @xmath0 sea quarks of mass corresponding to about 2/3 of the strange - quark mass .",
    "these correlations , normalised by the two point functions as appropriate , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.xtall ] . here",
    "the off - diagonal case ( labelled @xmath5 ) shows the important feature that it grows approximately linearly with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "this linear growth will only occur for on - shell transitions  @xcite and this is essentially the case here .            to extract an estimate of the transition amplitude",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath7 where these states are normalised on the lattice ( to unity ) .",
    "if higher excited states are neglected , one can make a two state model ( with basis states @xmath3 and the lightest @xmath4 state ) with this transition amplitude and evaluate the contributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.xtall ] . unlike weak decays",
    ", there is no specific operator that causes the transition in strong decays , hence the specific time ( between 0 and @xmath6 ) of any transition , such as @xmath8 , is not known .",
    "in general this makes it hard to control the contributions from excited states .",
    "as emphasized previously  @xcite , these excited state contributions can be avoided if the transition is approximately on - shell , when the linear dependence on @xmath6 of the off - diagonal transition amplitude ( with the slope @xmath9 ) is a unique signature of this on - shell transition .",
    "note that for the case of @xmath10 , the on - shell condition is much less well satisfied but the relative momentum of the pions in the centre of mass is twice as large as for @xmath11 and hence @xmath9 should be approximately twice as large , since for a p - wave decay there will be a momentum factor in the transition amplitude .",
    "a further check of the extraction of @xmath9 comes from the box diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig.quark]d , which will have a contribution behaving as @xmath12 arising from a @xmath3 intermediate state - see fig .",
    "[ fig.xtall ] .        for a more quantitative estimate of @xmath9",
    ", one can suppress excited state contributions in analysing the data of fig .",
    "[ fig.xtall ] , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that the above methods could be used , in principle , even in the quenched approximation .",
    "they depend on assuming that @xmath13 is fairly weak , as we indeed find .",
    "a more rigorous approach is to focus on energy values . when two levels are close ( our on - shell condition ) , then they will mix and the resultant energy shifts give relevant information  @xcite .",
    "moreover we can estimate these energy shifts from our @xmath9-value which provides more cross checks .",
    "these shifts can only be studied using dynamical fermions .    from a full variational analysis",
    "we obtain the energy shift of the @xmath14 state ( i.e. the un - binding energy ) , as needed in lscher s approach , as 0.02(2 ) upward which is consistent but not sufficiently accurate to use .",
    "the energy shift of the @xmath15 state can however be determined because of a lattice artifact .",
    "the @xmath3 with momentum 1 ( in lattice units of @xmath16 ) can have its spin aligned parallel to the momentum axis ( p ) or perpendicular to it ( a ) . because the @xmath17 state has relative momentum along a lattice axis and the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 has orbital angular momentum l=1 ( so a distribution like @xmath18 ) , only the parallel state ( p ) can mix with this two pion state .",
    "this mixing will not be present in the quenched approximation , so this provides a direct opportunity to see the effect of the two pion channel on the @xmath3 in unquenched studies .",
    "we do indeed find such a mass splitting between the p and a orientations of the @xmath3 due to mixing for @xmath0 but not for @xmath19 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.rhoratall ] .",
    "moreover the magnitude of this energy shift ( @xmath20 in lattice units ) is consistent with other determinations of the transition strength",
    ".     correlators . ]",
    "the basic assumption is that the transition from @xmath3 to @xmath4 is given by an effective interaction with a finite spatial extent , this is usually summarised by an effective lagrangian where we normalise the coupling as @xmath21 in terms of the decay width .",
    "then , provided the lattice spatial size is big enough that the hadrons are not distorted , our lattice situation ( where no decay occurs ) can be used to determine @xmath22 and this can then be used to predict decay widths when quark masses are varied , assuming that the coupling is largely independent of the quark masses .    from our lattice studies",
    ", we deduce that @xmath23 for @xmath5 . translating  @xcite this lattice transition amplitude to the continuum normalisation ,",
    "gives @xmath24 .",
    "using the observed @xmath15 energy shift gives another estimate , namely @xmath25 .",
    "note that our lattice values would need to be extrapolated to light sea - quarks and to the continuum limit to allow all sources of systematic error to be explored .",
    "nevertheless , these two values agree well with the values extracted from decays of @xmath3 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 mesons , namely @xmath28 .    encouraged by the success of the calculation of the decay width of the @xmath3 meson , we are starting to look at the decays of scalar mesons on the lattice .",
    "this is important for studying the glue components of singlet scalar mesons and to study @xmath29 and @xmath30 mesons which are believed to have important 4 quark contributions .",
    "there has been one earlier calculation of the decay width of the @xmath31 glueball from lattice qcd , but this has not been exploited by phenomenology  @xcite .    for decays of singlet",
    "scalar mesons there are additional diagrams to those in figure  [ fig.quark ] from disconnected graphs .",
    "the `` noise '' from the additional diagrams makes the extraction of a signal hard . in the real world",
    "the non - singlet @xmath29 meson has the strong decays @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "a direct comparison with experiment will be non - trivial because the @xmath34 decay involves a noisy disconnected loop and the @xmath35 decay requires @xmath36 sea quarks for a theoretically clean calculation in this channel ."
