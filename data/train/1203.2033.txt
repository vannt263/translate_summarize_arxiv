    "this result offers several interesting cues .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath86 and @xmath87 are found to be almost fully polarized , while the @xmath3 is only weakly polarized .",
    "the most reasonable explanation of this fact is that the fraction of @xmath3 mesons coming from @xmath81 decays is large and its polarization is very different with respect to the polarization of the directly produced @xmath3 . in fact , in the assumption that all directly produced @xmath4 states have the same polarization , we can translate the e866 measurement into a lower limit for the feed - down fraction @xmath83 from @xmath5 states , summing together @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 contributions .",
    "we use eq .",

    "the lower limit for @xmath83 corresponds to the case @xmath94 , @xmath95 , in which the @xmath3 mesons from @xmath81 decays have the largest negative value of @xmath74 .",
    "the result , depending slightly on the assumed ratio between @xmath46 and @xmath45 feed - down contributions , is shown in fig .  [ fig : e866_feeddown]b as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "more than @xmath96 of the @xmath3 are produced from @xmath5 states for @xmath97  gev@xmath62 , and more than @xmath98 for @xmath99  gev@xmath62 .",
    "these limits are appreciably higher than the value of the feed - down fraction of j/@xmath2 from @xmath51 measured at similar energy , low @xmath14 and mid rapidity  @xcite .",
    "we remind that we have obtained only a lower limit ( no upper limit is implied by the data ) , corresponding to the case in which @xmath100 and @xmath101 are always produced in the same very specific and pure angular momentum configurations .",
    "any deviation from this extreme case would lead to higher values of the indirectly determined feed - down fraction .",
    "the e866 measurement data also set an upper limit on the combined polarization of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "figure  [ fig : e866_feeddown]c shows the derived range of possible polarizations of @xmath3 coming from @xmath81 .",
    "the upper bound , corresponding to @xmath102 , coincides with the measured @xmath3 polarization .",
    "the lower bound , slightly depending on the relative contribution of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , is not influenced by the e866 data and corresponds to the minimum ( @xmath103 dependent ) value of @xmath83 represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : e866_feeddown]b .",
    "the second strong indication of the e866 data is , therefore , that at low @xmath14 the @xmath3 coming from @xmath81 decays has a longitudinal component in the collins - soper frame larger than @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , being @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) the maximum amount of longitudinal polarization that the @xmath3 produced in this way is allowed to have .",
    "also cdf has measured  @xcite , at higher @xmath14 , an almost unpolarized production of the @xmath3 mesons .",
    "however , the precision of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 data does not allow us to draw any conclusion about the difference between the polarizations of directly and indirectly produced states and , therefore , to infer a possible scenario of polarizations for the @xmath3 coming from @xmath81 decays . a comparison with the theory predictions for the directly produced @xmath3  @xcite would lead to conjectures identical to those made in the j/@xmath2 case , and , therefore , to a bottomonium polarization scenario completely analogous to the charmonium scenario described above .",
    "the e866 example suggests an alternative method to determine the polarization of the @xmath5-states , particularly suitable to certain experimental conditions and always useful as a cross - check of direct determinations .",
    "in fact , referring again to the scenario of fig .",
    "[ fig : e866_feeddown ] , a measurement of @xmath83 would transform the upper bound on the polarization of @xmath3 from @xmath81 decays into a univocal determination .",
    "we can formulate a general way of measuring the combined polarization of @xmath45 and @xmath46 states , consisting in the following set of measurements : 1 ) polarization , @xmath108 , of the inclusively produced prompt-@xmath19 state ; 2 ) polarization , @xmath109 , of the @xmath18 and/or @xmath110 states , assumed to be mostly directly produced ; 3 ) fraction , @xmath111 , of @xmath19 states produced in the decays of @xmath5 states .",
    "the polarization of the @xmath19 states coming from @xmath5 states can then be determined as using the expression @xmath112 ( 3 + \\lambda_\\vartheta^{1s } ) \\vec{\\lambda}^{2s } } { r(p ) ( 3 + \\lambda_\\vartheta^{1s } ) + \\lambda_\\vartheta^{2s } - \\lambda_\\vartheta^{1s }   }   \\ , , \\label{eq : lambdap_measurement}\\ ] ] obviously defined only for @xmath113 ( @xmath114 for @xmath115 ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , anisotropy parameters of the dilepton decay distribution of the daughter @xmath19 state , reflect univocally the average angular momentum configurations in which the @xmath45 and @xmath45 states are produced .",
    "a measurement of @xmath116 , merging @xmath45 and @xmath45 polarizations , can give significant indications , especially if its value is close to the boundaries of the parameter space and , therefore , does not suffer cancellation effects ( as the e866 example suggests ) .",
    "this method is convenient if the event sample becomes too small after the requirement of a photon coming from the @xmath39 transition , precluding a detailed angular analysis .    for our main result , presented in the next section",
    ", we will make use of the inverse procedure , in which a determination of @xmath111 is obtained by performing dilepton polarization measurements .",
    "for example , from measurements of @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 the @xmath7 feed - down is determined as @xmath120 the significance of this indirect determination will , in general , depend on the choice of the polarization frame and will be higher in a frame where the differences between the three @xmath23 parameters are more significant .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that it is possible to use the polarization of vector quarkonia , measured from dilepton event samples , as an instrument to study the suppression of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in heavy - ion collisions , where a direct determination of signal yields involving the identification of low - energy photons is essentially impossible . </S>",
    "<S> a change of the observed j/@xmath2 and @xmath3 polarizations from proton - proton to central nucleus - nucleus collisions would directly reflect differences in the nuclear dissociation patterns of @xmath4 and @xmath5 states and may provide a strong indication for quarkonium sequential suppression in the quark - gluon plasma . </S>"
