    "dusty or complex plasma is a low - temperature plasma , which includes dust particles with sizes ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . due to the higher electron mobility",
    ", particles acquire a considerable electric charge .",
    "thus , a strongly coupled coulomb system is formed.@xcite in such a plasma , various collective phenomena at the level of individual particles can be observed .",
    "complex plasmas are usually studied in gas discharges at low pressures , e.g. , in the radio frequency ( rf ) discharges . under microgravity conditions , a large homogeneous bulk of the complex plasma can be observed .",
    "the microgravity conditions are realized either in parabolic flights@xcite or onboard the international space station ( iss).@xcite    in most studies , attention is focused on individual particles injected in plasma , which is a model of the rarefied dust cloud .",
    "elaborate theories model the charge of a particle and its screening by the plasma , elementary processes occurring on the particle surface , interaction between the particles and streams of ions and neutrals associated with the momentum transfer , interaction of particles at large distances etc.@xcite at the same time in the dust clouds observed experimentally , dust particles are situated at the distances , which are insufficiently large to neglect collective phenomena that control the particle charging and stability of a dust cloud .",
    "the strong interaction between dust particles and their interaction with the ions and electrons result in such a collective phenomenon as the void formation .",
    "formation and stability of the voids were investigated in refs .  .",
    "these studies , however , were aimed at the void  dust boundary , and little attention was paid to the parameters of the bulk of a dust cloud apart from the boundary .",
    "another manifestation of the collective phenomena in a dust cloud is a spatial distribution of the particles .",
    "it was noticed long ago that a dust cloud with an arbitrary particle number density could not be created for the given particle radius .",
    "the number of particles injected into the rf discharge plasma influences solely the volume occupied by the dust cloud rather than the particle number density . in different experiments , the latter seems to scale with the particle radius and electron temperature in some way .",
    "this phenomenon is not understood so far .",
    "some experiments are carried out on an inhomogeneous system consisting of the particles with different diameters .",
    "the simplest example of such a system is a large particle surrounded by a dense cloud of smaller particles .",
    "usually , this particle called the projectile moves through the cloud with a supersonic or subsonic velocity .",
    "such projectiles are generated using controlled mechanisms of acceleration@xcite , or they can appear sporadically.@xcite a strongly coupled coulomb system like dust particles in the gas discharge plasma can be represented as a system of the wigner ",
    "seitz cells with a particle in the center of each cell . according to a natural assumption of the cell quasineutrality and to the proportionality between the particle radius and its charge ,",
    "the particle diameter must be proportional to the cube of cell radius .",
    "instead , it was observed experimentally that the radius of a cell around a projectile is always noticeably larger than it could be expected from the foregoing considerations .",
    "this fact was also not understood as yet .",
    "we propose a model of a dust cloud based on the allowance for a collective interaction between a dense cloud of the dust particles and the streaming ions . as it was noted in an early study,@xcite stability of a particle in a dust cloud",
    "is provided by the balance between the ion drag force and the electric force generated due to the ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we point to the fact that a dust cloud realized in the experiment is so dense that the characteristic impact parameter of the momentum transfer from the ions to a particle is _ larger _ than the interparticle distance .",
    "in other terms , the amount of the moment transfer is restricted by the overlap of scattering potentials of neighboring particles . as a consequence ,",
    "the drag force turns out to be dependent on the particle number density . with due regard for this fact we construct the  equation of state \" for the dust cloud based on the equation of force balance , the equation defining the particle charge , and the overall plasma charge balance ( quasineutrality )",
    "this equation of state is written in dimensionless quantities reduced to their  critical \" values similar to those appearing in the van der waals equation .",
    "based on this equation , one can calculate the particle number density as a function of the ion number density , the electron temperature , and the mass of a carrier gas atom .",
    "the obtained equation makes it possible to formulate a _ scaling law _ for a homogeneous dust cloud , which states that for the same carrier gas , the ratio of the squared interparticle distance to the product of the particle radius and the electron temperature must be constant in different systems .",
    "if the ion number density is sufficiently large , the equation of state has no solutions .",
    "apparently , this is indicative of the existence of the void  dust boundary .",
    "the equation of state allows one to treat the simplest inhomogeneous system , namely , a projectile in the dust cloud .",
    "we find the radius of a cavity around the projectile from a balance between the changes of the work against the static pressure of dust particles required to create a cavity and the energy of the electric field induced by the charge of a projectile .",
    "the static pressure is calculated from the equation of state of dust particles .",
    "the resulting cavity radius proves to be proportional to the square root of the projectile radius rather than to the power of 1/3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ s2 ] , the equation of state is deduced for a homogeneous dust cloud . the radius of a cavity around a large particle in such a cloud is estimated in sec .",
    "calculation results are compared with available experimental data in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , and the results of this study are summarized in sec .",
    "consider a stationary dust cloud in the rf discharge and formulate the condition of a particle mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the stability of such a state will not be tested .",
    "consequently , the condition formulated in what follows may refer both to a stable and to an unstable branch of plasma parameters . under microgravity conditions ,",
    "a quiescent dust particle is subject to only two forces , namely , the force acting from the electric field @xmath2 and the ion drag force @xmath3 . here",

    "the ion drag force arises due to scattering of the streaming ions on dust particles . for an isolated dust particle ,",
    "the coulomb cross section of the momentum transfer from an ion to a particle is proportional to @xmath20 and can be estimated in the order of magnitude as @xmath21 , where @xmath22.@xcite for typical parameters of a dust cloud in the rf discharge produced on pk-3 plus setup,@xcite @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 exceeds noticeably the average distance between the dust particles characterized by the radius of the wigner  seitz cell for dust particles @xmath25 . under these conditions ,",
    "the potentials acting on an ion from the neighboring particles overlap .",
    "this situation is typical , e.g. , for the dense plasma of alkali metal vapors,@xcite where the electron mobility is defined by the overlapped potentials of individual scattering atoms .",
    "the overlapping reduces @xmath12 dramatically , and it can be estimated as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is some coefficient . if @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ion debye length , the potential of a particle can be approximated by the unscreened coulomb potential in the most part of a cell except for the vicinity of its boundary .",
    "the quasineutrality of the wigner ",
    "seitz cell leads to an effective cutoff of the coulomb potential inside the cell at the distance @xmath30 ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "we will assume that the ion ",
    "particle scattering is equivalent to the collisions of the ions against a hard sphere with the radius @xmath31 .",
    "then the corresponding drag force can be written as @xmath32 , where it has been taken into account that the ion drift velocity in the electric field @xmath11 is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ion mean free path with respect to the collisions against neutrals .    at the equilibrium , @xmath35 , and we obtain the force balance equation @xmath36 the particle potential will be defined using the orbital motion limited ( oml ) approximation , which proves to be useful in most applications.@xcite the quantity @xmath37 is a solution of the equation@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "note that @xmath40 is typically greater or much greater than @xmath41 , which means that the oml approximation is still valid , i.e. , the ion flux on a particle is almost the same as for an isolated particle , unless the scattering potentials overlap .",
    "this is due to the fact that large impact parameters @xmath42 contribute appreciably to the total coulomb moment transfer cross section .",
    "equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) are completed by the local quasineutrality condition @xmath43 which is accurate to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the electron debye length and @xmath46 is the system length scale .",

    "formation of a cavity around the projectile is quite similar to the cavity formation around a particle , which interacts with the molecules of surrounding liquid via a repulsive potential , known as self - trapping [ see , e.g. , ref .  ] . assuming that the electric filed of a charged projectile is screened outside the cavity , we can write the work of formation of a cavity with the radius @xmath122 as follows : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the static pressure of the particles in a dust cloud",

    "if the cavity as a whole was neutral ( as in a homogeneous system ) the scaling would be different : @xmath134 .",
    "thus for a projectile , we note a violation of the overall quasineutrality of the cell , whose radius is defined by the pressure balance between the cell and surrounding dust cloud .",
    "the resulting positive excess charge may break the spherical symmetry of the cell due to the effect of the electric field .",
    "this may stipulate the projectile motion .",
    "the case of a projectile with a very large radius @xmath135 is treated in appendix .",
    "the only difference from the opposite case @xmath136 treated above is the equation defining the projectile potential ( [ e14 ] ) .",
    "the similarity between ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e14 ] ) is indicative of the fact that both cases are qualitatively similar .",
    "we start the analysis with the data on the dust clouds formed by particles with the same diameter .",
    "it is a special problem , which branch of the solution of eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) should be associated with experiment .",
    "we suppose that the region far from the critical point along the branch with a high particle number density can hardly be realized under any rf discharge mode because in this case , the rate of the ion  electron recombination on the particle surface would be too high and , due to the low electron number density , the ionization rate would be too low to sustain the discharge .",
    "however , this branch can be realized in the vicinity of the critical point in the unstable regime known as the heartbeat oscillations.@xcite in any case , the analysis of stability of the high - density branch is a separate problem to be addressed in future .",
    "thus , we confine ourselves with the low - density branch and assume that far apart from the critical point , the effect of dust particles on the ion number density can be neglected .    since the dust particle number density is usually estimated in the middle of a dust cloud , i.e. , far apart from the void  dust boundary or from the critical point , it is reasonable to set approximately @xmath137 . since @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the pressure of neutral gas atoms , and one can roughly assume that @xmath140,@xcite the product @xmath141 is almost constant",

    "we propose an equation of state for a dense dust cloud in the rf discharge , which expresses the potential of charged particles as a function of the ion number density given the electron temperature and the mass of a carrier gas atom .",
    "the key assumption is the overlap of potentials of the dust particles , which scatter streaming ions . as a result ,",
    "the ion drag force proved to be dependent on the number density of particles .",
    "the latter gives rise to a two - branch solution corresponding to the normal and the increased particle number densities . for the branch with a normal density ,",
    "the equation of state allows one to deduce a scaling law for dust clouds in the rf discharge , which relates the particle number density in a cloud to the particle radius and the electron temperature . as for the branch with the increased density",
    ", we expect that its manifestation could be the heartbeat oscillations , while a non - stationary dust cloud is involved in a self - sustained oscillation from one branch to another one",
    ". the investigation of stability for both branches will be addressed in future .    a notion of self - trapping of charged particles in condensed matter",
    "was used to calculate the radius of a cavity around a large particle ( projectile ) , which penetrates into the dust cloud . the static pressure of dust particles involved in the resulting expression",
    "was obtained from the equation of state for a dust cloud . with respect to this problem , the calculation of refined distributions of charged particles within the cell around a projectile would give a clue to understanding the projectile motion through the dust cloud .    a good correspondence with the available experimental data and theoretical estimations of other studies points to the relevance of the proposed approach .",
    "despite this fact , some assumptions involved in the proposed theory are worth discussion .",
    "first , the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) utilizes a simplified estimate for the cross section of the momentum transfer from ions to a particle .",
    "however , due to the potential overlapping in a dense particle system , refinement of this cross section can not result in a significant correction to the results .",
    "the correction that is more noticeable could result from taking into account a nonlinear dependence of the drag force on the ion stream velocity in the region @xmath183 .",
    "the main objective of the proposed theory is to account for properties of a dust cloud far apart from the void  dust boundary .",
    "nevertheless , it is of interest to extend the theory toward the critical point . in this",
    "respect , interpretation of a decreasing dependence of the electron number density on the ion number density in a close vicinity of the critical point ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) is an urgent problem .",
    "the approximation of the spatial ion density by the dependence ( [ e070 ] ) in the vicinity of a critical point is knowingly too crude because it does not take into account the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath184 at @xmath185 .",
    "a rigorous approach would imply solution of the poisson equation instead of the plasma quasineutrality equation ( [ e3 ] ) ; the continuity equation ( [ e050 ] ) should be completed by the ionization and recombination terms .",
    "however , complexity of the elementary processes occurring in the gas phase and a deficient information makes a correct simulation of the complex plasma problematic .",
    "another point that is worth a separate treatment is the probable enhancement of the ion flux to the particle surface due to the ion trapping near dust particles and the resulting increase in the frequency of collisions between ions and neutrals .",
    "this effect must substantially reduce the particle charge as compared to the oml approximation.@xcite we suppose that this problem needs further investigation and can only note that all calculation results discussed in the foregoing are hardly compatible with any approximation other than the oml .",
    "this research is supported by the russian scientific foundation grant no .",
    "14 - 12 - 01235 .",
    "we use the model of a cavity around a large particle developed in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] . for a macroscopic particle , however , the oml approximation is invalid because @xmath186 , and we have to estimate the ion flux to the surface of a large particle using an opposite approximation , namely , the diffusion one .",
    "we will neglect screening of the particle charge inside the cavity , so that @xmath187 . in this approximation ,",
    "the ion flux includes the diffusion and drift components,@xcite @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath190 is the local ion number density inside the cavity , and @xmath191 is its local drift velocity at the distance @xmath72 from the cavity center .",
    "we substitute ( [ e11 ] ) into the local stationary continuity equation @xmath192 to derive @xmath193 where @xmath194 . the solution of eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) with the obvious boundary conditions @xmath195 and @xmath196 is @xmath197 therefore , the ion flux on the particle surface is @xmath198 .",
    "it proves to be not much different from that given by the oml approximation .",
    "indeed , the collisions with neutrals slow down the ions but they remove the energy and momentum limitations on the ions involved in the oml .",
    "these two factors seem to attenuate each other . assuming the boltzmann distribution for the electrons , we write the electron flux as @xmath199 . in a stationary state ,",
