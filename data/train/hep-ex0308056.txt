    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) offers the unique opportunity to study the production mechanism of heavy quarks via the strong interaction in a particularly clean environment where a point - like projectile , a virtual photon with a virtuality @xmath3 , collides with a proton .",
    "a first measurement of the total inclusive @xmath4-quark cross section in the dis region has been released by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "recently , the zeus collaboration has measured the production cross section of @xmath4-quarks in dis at hera , in the reaction with at least one hard jet in the breit frame , where @xmath5 is the momentum of the exchanged photon , @xmath6 is the bjorken scaling variable and @xmath7 is the proton momentum , a purely space - like photon and a proton collide head - on . ] and a muon in the final state ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "due to the large @xmath4-quark mass , muons from semi - leptonic @xmath4 decays usually have high values of @xmath9 , which is the transverse momentum of the muon with respect to the axis of the closest jet .",
    "this allows a statistical separation of the signal from the background .",
    "the data used in the measurement were collected during the 1999 - 2000 hera running period , corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 60 pb@xmath10 and at a center - of - mass energy of 318 gev .",
    "a detailed description of the zeus detector can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the event sample was selected in four steps :    * dis events were selected by requiring a well reconstructed outgoing positron with energy greater than 10 gev , @xmath0 gev@xmath1 and inelasticity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "* muons were identified by requiring a reconstructed segment both in the inner and outer part of barrel and rear muon chambers , where the rear direction is defined by the incoming positron .",
    "the reconstructed muons are matched in space and momentum with a track found in the central tracker .",
    "in addition , a cut on the muon momentum @xmath13 gev is applied together with a cut on the muon polar angle @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "* hadronic final - state objects , reconstructed from tracks and energy deposit in the calorimeter , were boosted to the breit frame and clustered into jets using the @xmath16 clustering algorithm @xcite .",
    "selected events had at least one jet with @xmath17 gev and within the detector acceptance @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the pseudorapidity in the laboratory frame is defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the polar angle measured in with respect to the proton beam direction ] . * the muons in the sample",
    "were associated with a jet using the @xmath16 algorithm information , where the associated jet was not necessarily the jet satisfying the cuts above . to ensure a good reconstruction of the associated jet , it was required to have transverse energy in the breit frame @xmath22 gev .",
    "after all selection cuts the final data sample contains 836 events .    to correct the results for detector effects and to extract the fraction of events from @xmath4 decays the rapgap monte carlo program @xcite was used .",
    "the light - flavour and charm - quark rapgap samples were mixed according to the relative luminosities and the @xmath4-quark sample was added according to the beauty fraction determined from the analysis of the @xmath9 distribution . to determine the fraction of events from @xmath4 decays in the data , the contribution from light - plus - charm flavours and beauty were allowed to vary , and the best mixture was extracted using a binned maximum - likelihood method .",
    "the measured fraction of @xmath4 decays is @xmath23 , where the error is statistical .",
    "this mixture describes well the shape of all event kinematic variables .",
    "the total visible cross section , @xmath24 , was determined in the kinematic range @xmath0 gev@xmath1 , @xmath11 with a muon with @xmath25 gev and @xmath15 and at least one jet in the breit frame with @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 .",
    "the cross section is @xmath26 the nlo qcd predictions were evaluated using the hvqdis program @xcite .",
    "fragmentation of @xmath4-quarks into hadrons was performed using the peterson function @xcite with @xmath27 as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . the semi - leptonic decay of @xmath4-hadrons was modeled using a parameterisation of the muon momentum spectrum extracted from rapgap .",
    "the @xmath4-quark mass was set to @xmath28 gev and the renormalisation and factorisation scales to @xmath29 .",
    "the cteq5f4 proton parton densities  @xcite were used .",
    "the nlo qcd prediction is @xmath30 pb , where the error was estimated by varying the scale @xmath31 by a factor of 2 and the mass @xmath32 between 4.5 and 5.0 gev and adding the respective contributions in quadrature . a more detailed discussion of the qcd prediction and the related uncertainties for this process can be found in ref .",
    "the measured total cross section is somewhat above but agrees with the nlo prediction within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the program cascade @xcite , based on the ccfm evolution equations  @xcite and on gluon densities depending on the transverse parton momenta emitted along the cascade , gives a prediction of 35 pb , which is in good agreement with the data .",
    "the differential cross sections were calculated in the same kinematic range as the total cross section by repeating the fit of the @xmath9 distribution in each bin .",
    "figure  [ fig : datanlo ] shows the differential cross section as functions of @xmath3 and @xmath6 compared to the nlo .",
    "the nlo predictions agree reasonably well with the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : datalo ] shows the same differential cross sections compared with the lo monte carlo programs .",
    "the lo qcd prediction folded with the dglap qcd @xcite evolution equations ( rapgap ) underestimates the measured cross section .",
    "cascade is in good agreement with the data .",
    "the production of beauty quarks was measured in the process @xmath33 with the zeus detector at hera .",
    "the nlo qcd predictions agree with the measured total cross section and differential cross sections as functions of @xmath3 and the bjorken variable @xmath6 within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the cascade monte carlo program gives a good description of the measured cross sections .",
