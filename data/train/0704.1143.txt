    "over the last twenty years , the standard model ( sm ) has provided an exceptionally accurate description of all high energy physics experiments  whether they be electroweak precision or flavor physics observables .",
    "the only part of the standard model that remains to be tested is the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking . in the standard model ,",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking is achieved by the scalar higgs field acquiring a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , thereby giving mass to the quarks , leptons and gauge bosons . however",
    ", this mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking has a problem in that the higgs potential is unstable with respect to radiative corrections , that is the scalar higgs mass gets radiative corrections proportional to the cutoff due to fermion and boson loops .",
    "a number of extensions of the standard model have been suggested to try to alleviate this problem .",
    "supersymmetry is one of the most promising of these extensions of the sm , in which every sm fermion ( boson ) has a spin-0 ( spin-1/2 ) super - partner .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model or mssm , with gauge invariant susy breaking masses of the order of 1 tev , predicts an extended higgs sector with a light sm - like higgs boson of mass lower than about 130 gev  @xcite@xcite that is in good agreement with precision electroweak measurements .",
    "however the flavor structure of these susy breaking masses is not well understood .",
    "if there are no tree - level flavor changing neutral currents associated with the gauge and super - gauge interactions , the deviations from sm predictions are small .",
    "such small deviations can be achieved if the quark and squark mass matrices are block diagonalizable in the same basis ( an example is flavor blind squark and slepton masses ) .",
    "the flavor violating effects in these minimal flavor violating models are induced by loop factors proportional to ckm matrix elements as in the standard model .",
    "the b - physics properties of these kinds of supersymmetric extensions of the sm have been studied in great detail in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite .",
    "the recent improvements in our understanding of b - physics observables have put interesting constraints on higgs searches in the mssm at the tevatron and lhc colliders . in ref .  @xcite we analyzed the constraints that the non - observation of the @xmath7 rare decay and the measurement of the @xmath0 rare decay put on non - standard model higgs searches at hadron colliders . in this article",
    ", we additionally explore the regions of susy parameter space that can be probed in sm - like higgs searches for different benchmark scenarios .",
    "we also extend our analysis in the b - physics sector to include the additional information coming from the recent measurement of @xmath8 at belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite .",
    "we find an interesting region of parameter space ( i.e. large values of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath4 and moderate values of the stop mixing parameter @xmath9 ) for which non - standard higgs searches are not strongly constrained by b - physics .",
    "in particular , we find that scenarios with small stop mixing , like the so called minimal mixing scenario  @xcite , and large higgsino parameter @xmath4 look very promising for the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "b - physics constraints in these scenarios seem to allow the region around a cp - odd higgs mass @xmath10  gev and @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the ratio of the two higgs vev s ) , which can be easily probed at the tevatron in the near future . for non - standard higgs searches",
    "we show the present d0  @xcite and cdf  @xcite excluded regions in the @xmath13 plane with 1 fb  @xmath14 of data in the @xmath15 inclusive channel and the tevatron and lhc available projections for 4 fb@xmath14 and 30 fb@xmath14  @xcite respectively , that depend only slightly on the other low energy susy parameters .",
    "small to moderate mssm higgs masses are also interesting from the point of view of direct dark matter detection experiments , since in that case t - channel higgs exchange contributes importantly to neutralino dark matter scattering off nuclei .",
    "this contribution implies a strong connection between the constraints on susy parameters from direct dark matter searches and non - standard mssm higgs searches at colliders . in particular , the present direct detection limits on neutralino",
    "dark matter within the mssm puts strong constraints on higgs searches unless the higgsino component of the neutralino is quite small ( i.e. large values of @xmath4 ) , independent of the stop sector parameters  @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we define our theoretical setup for both the b - physics constraints and higgs searches within the mssm . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss representative benchmark scenarios that have different properties for b - physics and higgs searches .",
    "we show that within the mssm there is a strong complementarity between the constraints coming from non - standard higgs searches and rare b - decays .",
    "taking into account these constraints we study the potential for standard model like higgs boson discovery at the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "for the tevatron higgs searches we assumed , conservatively , a final tevatron luminosity of 4  fb@xmath14 , while for higgs searches at lhc , in the early phase , we used the expected 30  fb@xmath14 luminosity estimates .",
    "finally we conclude in section  4 .",
    "in the mssm there are three neutral scalar higgs fields . assuming no extra sources of cp violation in the mssm beyond that of the sm , there are two cp - even higgs bosons which are admixtures of the real neutral @xmath16 and @xmath17 components @xmath18 and an additional cp - odd higgs field @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mixing angle that diagonalizes the cp - even higgs mass matrix .",
    "the tree - level higgs couplings to the sm fermions and gauge bosons are given by  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 can be either the @xmath23 or @xmath24 vector boson . at moderate or large values of @xmath25",
    ", one of the two cp - even higgs bosons tends to couple strongly to the gauge bosons while the other one only couples weakly .",

    "the cp - odd and the other cp - even higgs bosons are denoted as non - standard and have @xmath25 enhanced couplings to the down quarks and leptons ( see eq .  [ coupl : eq ] ) .",
    "the identification of the sm - like higgs depends critically on the size of the pole mass of the pseudo - scalar higgs @xmath26 . for large values of @xmath26 ,",
    "the lighter higgs becomes sm - like and its mass has the approximate analytic form  @xcite @xmath27 , \\label{mhmax : eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the geometric mean of the stop masses . in eq .",
    "( [ mhmax : eq ] ) , we have included the leading two - loop radiative corrections from the stop sector but we have not included the two - loop corrections associated with the relation between the top quark mass and the top yukawa coupling at the stop mass scale , that depends on the relative sign of the gluino mass and @xmath9  @xcite . at values of the cp - odd higgs boson mass @xmath26 less than @xmath32 and large values of @xmath25 , @xmath33 and",
    "the heavier cp - even higgs is sm - like with mass given approximately by eq .",
    "( [ mhmax : eq ] ) .",
    "the cms and atlas collaborations have calculated the signal significance curves for standard model higgs detection at the lhc . due to the modified higgs couplings in the mssm , for the same higgs masses , these estimates can change significantly with changes in the supersymmetric mass parameters . to quantify",
    "when the significance will be either enhanced or reduced we consider the quantity  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 are particles produced in association with the higgs and @xmath36 are sm decay products of the higgs . as the predicted sm - like higgs mass range within the mssm is less than or about @xmath37  gev , we only consider the light higgs production and decay channels @xmath38 and @xmath39 at the lhc and @xmath40 at the tevatron . at a luminosity larger than 30  fb@xmath14 at the lhc ,",
    "the @xmath41 will become effective .",
    "however as we are considering only the early phase of the lhc we will not study this process .    for the @xmath42 channel",
    "the higgs is produced dominantly by weak - boson fusion .",
    "hence , the tree - level production cross - section is proportional to the square of the @xmath43 coupling in eq .",
    "( [ coupl : eq ] ) , which implies that the ratio of production cross - sections in eq .",
    "( [ rratio : eq ] ) is proportional to @xmath44 when @xmath26 is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath45 . at large @xmath25 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) the higgs mixing angle @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "hence , in this region of the @xmath50 plane the @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) couplings are very close to their sm values .",
    "therefore at large @xmath25 and small or large values of @xmath26 , compared to @xmath45 , the ratio @xmath53 is close to one . for @xmath54 channel",
    "the higgs is mainly produced through gluon fusion which is induced by third generation quark and squark loops . for squark masses greater than @xmath55  gev , like those we are considering in this paper ,",
    "the squark contributions are small and the sm - like higgs has a production cross - section similar to that of the standard model higgs .",
    "whenever @xmath26 is comparable to the sm - like higgs mass , @xmath56  gev , both the cp - even higgs bosons acquire similar masses and have non - standard gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "hence for each of these channels we follow the prescription given in ref .",
    "@xcite and sum the contributions from both the cp - even higgs states so that @xmath57 because we assume that the two signals can not be separated .",
    "if @xmath26 is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath45 and the loop corrections to the off - diagonal elements of the cp - even higgs mass matrix are small , then the large @xmath25 induced corrections do not enhance or reduce the @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) or @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) couplings and they remain standard model like .",
    "hence , in these regions of parameter space the branching ratios into either @xmath62 s or @xmath63 s are close to their standard model values . the @xmath64 coupling is induced through quark loops and hence is generally small . however , in scenarios where the @xmath65 and @xmath66 couplings are suppressed , like for example if there is a cancellation of the off - diagonal cp - even mass higgs matrix element due to radiative effects , the @xmath67 branching ratio can be relatively enhanced .",
    "we shall discuss this case in section  [ smallalpeff : sec ] .      at large @xmath25",
    "the non - standard higgs bosons are produced in association with bottom quarks or through gluon fusion .",

    "we have previously analyzed this scenario in ref .",
    "@xcite without adding the @xmath184 constraints . in fig .",
    "[ xt0mu15:fig ] we see that the addition of this new constraint excludes the diagonal region with corners @xmath185 and @xmath186 for the parameters @xmath187 and @xmath188 . in fig .",
    "[ xt0mu15:fig ]  ( a ) we show the effect of the lep bound on the b - physics allowed regions .",
    "the region below the blue ( black ) solid line shows the area excluded by the lep bound in the @xmath50 plane .    from fig .",
    "[ xt0mu15:fig ]  ( b ) and ( c ) it is clear that the cms and atlas experiment can probe most of the allowed b - physics regions of the @xmath142 plane , using sm - like higgs searches in the @xmath153 and the @xmath152 channels .",
    "cms has an inaccessible region at large @xmath26 in the @xmath15-channel because in this region the @xmath63 yukawa coupling is only slightly above the standard model value and according to ref .",
    "@xcite cms does not have a 5@xmath6 signal significance with 30  fb@xmath14 of data for any standard model higgs mass .",
    "however , given that the higgs mass and the @xmath152 coupling vary smoothly with @xmath26 and @xmath131 the discovery potential is also above 4@xmath6 for most of the region that appears inaccessible in fig .",
    "[ xt0mu15:fig ]  ( b ) .",
    "again , at 4  fb@xmath14 the tevatron could have a 3@xmath6 evidence over most of the parameter space allowed by b - physics and the lep higgs mass bound",
    ".    we would like to stress that the b physics and the lep excluded regions , for the minimal mixing scenario , allow a clear region of @xmath189  gev and @xmath190 .",
    "these values are easily within the tevatron s sensitivity region for non - standard higgs searches in the @xmath191 channel .",
    "in addition , the sm - like higgs boson mass is close to the current limit and therefore should be visible at the tevatron at the 3  @xmath6 level with an increase in sensitivity and luminosity . both cdf and d0 collaborations",
    "have recently made public their findings in the inclusive @xmath192 channel at a luminosity of 1  fb  @xmath14 .",
    "the cdf experiment finds a slight excess  @xcite while the d0 experiment  @xcite finds a reduction in the signal for the same values of the the @xmath193 visible mass .",
    "the d0 limit further limits the upper b - physics allowed region to values of @xmath194  gev and @xmath195 .",
    "this scenario can be relatively insensitive to small changes in the value of @xmath9 .",
    "it would seem that increasing the value of @xmath9 would make the @xmath7 constraint extremely strong . however , there is a @xmath196 dependence from the @xmath197 factor in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ brbsmumu : eq ] ) and only a linear @xmath4 dependence in its numerator .",
    "thus as long as the loop factors @xmath198 are positive and @xmath4 is large , even moderate values of @xmath9 do not strengthen the @xmath7 constraint . additionally at large values of @xmath4 , @xmath92 and @xmath25 the charged higgs contribution to the @xmath199 amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ bsgh+:eq ] ) may have the opposite sign to the sm one , a novel result that only occurs for this range of parameters . in this region of parameter space , to cancel this negative charged higgs amplitude we need the chargino - stop contribution in eq .",
    "( [ bsgchi : eq ] ) to be positive or the sign of @xmath160 to be positive .",
    "this scenario was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the off - diagonal components of the cp - even higgs mass matrix are approximately zero .",
    "this approximate cancellation can be achieved by making , for instance , the following choice of parameters @xmath201 a consequence of this cancellation is that the couplings of the sm - like higgs boson to the b - quarks and @xmath63-leptons are suppressed .     in fig .",
    "[ xt12mu25:fig ] we present the effect of this choice of parameters on the b - physics allowed region and on higgs searches at the lhc and tevatron .",
    "the b - physics constraints are quite severe and similar to the large @xmath9 scenario we discussed above .",
    "the @xmath153 channel for sm - like higgs searches is enhanced because the @xmath202 and @xmath5 branching ratios are suppressed , leading to an enhancement of the @xmath153 branching ratio .",
    "therefore the cms and altas experiments will be able to probe a large part of the @xmath203 plane in the @xmath153 channel",
    ". the tevatron will not be able to probe most of the b - physics allowed region because of the suppression of the @xmath5 branching ratio .",
    "in this article we have studied the inter - play between b - physics constraints and higgs searches at hadron colliders in the framework of minimal flavor violating susy models .",
    "the results we present here depend on the projected sensitivities of the cms and atlas experiments and the tevatron collider in the different sm - like and non - standard higgs boson channels .",
    "the tevatron projections assumed in this work  @xcite need to be further solidified by improvements in the analyses that cdf and d0 are performing . both cms and atlas have recently performed improvements in their projections in the @xmath172 inclusive channel and cms has also recently updated their @xmath152 vector boson fusion study  @xcite . we have illustrated this interplay between higgs searches at hadron colliders and b - physics constraints using four benchmark senarios .",
    "in particular the b - physics constraints are extremely severe for susy parameters which have large values of @xmath9 and small values of @xmath4 . for sm - like",
    "higgs boson searches the lhc experiments should be able to probe all of the allowed region of parameter space with 30  fb@xmath14 , but the tevatron collider will have difficulties doing this with 4  fb@xmath14 of data . discovering a sm - like higgs boson at the cms experiment with 30  fb@xmath14 of data",
    "will be challenging in this scenario , since cms has a better sensitivity in the @xmath153 rather than in the @xmath152 channel and as the @xmath58 and the @xmath204 couplings are somewhat enhanced for moderate or small @xmath26 , the @xmath205 branching ratio is smaller than in the sm . on the other hand , the atlas experiment will easily probe the allowed region of parameter space because the @xmath152 branching ratio is enhanced for these values of susy parameters .",
    "the tevatron will find it very difficult to detect a sm - like higgs in this scenario because the sm - like higgs is heavy and the signal significance , in the @xmath5 channel , drops sharply with increasing higgs mass .",
    "additionally , in this scenario the b - physics constraints favor regions which have large values of @xmath26 and low values of @xmath25 while the non - standard higgs boson searches at hadron colliders are less efficient in these regions",
    ". therefore at a luminosity of 30  fb@xmath14 the lhc will be able to observe the sm - like higgs , but may find it difficult to discover non - standard higgs bosons .",
    "the b - physics constraints are far weaker for large values of @xmath4 and small values of @xmath9 due to a suppression of susy contributions to the @xmath206 and the @xmath0 rates . at the same time",
    "the present lep bounds on the sm - like higgs mass put strong constraints on the allowed regions of parameter space , in particular for @xmath207  tev .",
    "for the minimal mixing scenario with @xmath208  tev we have studied , the lhc will be able to probe most of the b - physics allowed region in non - standard higgs searches , for values of @xmath209  gev .",
    "for sm - like higgs searches , with 30  fb@xmath14 of data , the cms collaboration should be able to probe most of the allowed regions , while the atlas collaboration will be able to probe all of them .",
    "in addition , this scenario is the most promising for the tevatron to detect both the sm - like higgs and the non - standard higgs bosons in the near future .",
    "the final benchmark scenario we studied was that of small @xmath200 . due to the suppression of sm - like higgs couplings to b - quarks and @xmath63 s ,",
    "the @xmath172 channel is enhanced . due to this enhancement both",
    "the lhc experiments will be able to discover the sm - like higgs over most of the b - physics allowed parameter space",
    ". the tevatron will find it difficult to detect a sm - like higgs due its mass and suppressed couplings to @xmath210 .    in conclusion , scenarios with lower values of stop mixing parameter @xmath9 and larger values of higgsino mass parameter @xmath4 will be easier to probe at hadron colliders through direct higgs searches of both standard and non - standard higgs bosons . at larger values of @xmath9 ,",
    "direct non - standard higgs boson searches are strongly constrained by present bounds on b - physics observables . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm - like higgs boson mass is enhanced through radiative corrections , rendering it more easily detectable at the lhc .",
    "finally , the observation of a sm - like higgs in the @xmath152 channel and not in the @xmath153 or vice versa , may be used to obtain additional information on the values of the supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
