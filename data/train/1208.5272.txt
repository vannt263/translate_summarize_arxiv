    "the presence of optically thick obscuring tori has been postulated to explain the various observed properties of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , particularly with respect to the two major categories of agns , namely , type 1 and type 2 @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the optically and geometrically thick material that covers a large solid angle with respect to the agn and the nature of its three - dimensional structure are still unclear , although its geometry is often schematically described as a `` doughnut - shaped '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , statistical studies of the absorption features of local agns suggested have suggested the presence of complex , inhomogeneous obscuring material around the central engine @xcite .",
    "the clumpy torus model is also consistent with the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the essential question that then arises is regarding how such an inhomogeneous ` torus ' is formed and how it attains such a large covering fraction against the energy dissipation of the clumpy medium in the gravitational field of the central black hole .",
    "numerous theoretical models have been proposed to explain the origin of the obscuring material . on an accretion disk scale",
    "the proposed causes include hydromagnetic disk winds @xcite , disk - driven hydromagnetic winds and radiation pressure due to continuum emission from the accretion disk @xcite , and warping of irradiated accretion disks @xcite .",
    "although a pasec - scale dusty torus is observed in some nearby agns @xcite , the nucleus could be obscured by relatively less dense ism in the range of 10 - 100 pc or even by galactic disks themselves @xcite .",
    "there are many instances where evidence suggests that most agns are associated with circumnuclear starbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is suggested that the star formation activities drive mass inflow into agns , thereby leading to the growth of black holes ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "the nuclear starbursts themselves could inflate the circumnuclear disk and obscure the central source . @xcite and @xcite have proposed that a clumpy torus - like structure is naturally reproduced due to energy feedback from supernova explosions ( sne ) in a disk . in their model ,",
    "the internal density and temperature of the thick disk are highly inhomogeneous , and the velocity field of the disk is turbulent .",
    "the scale height of the disk is determined by the balance between the turbulent energy dissipation and energy input from sne .",
    "more recently , @xcite have proposed that 10-pc - scale thick tori can be formed even without the existence of strong stellar energy feedback if gas inflow from kiloparsec scales drives instability in the circumnuclear region .    on a parsec scale or smaller , geometrically and optically thick torus sustained by radiation pressure have been suggested @xcite . following this model , static solutions of thick disks supported by infrared radiation",
    "have been explored by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite",
    "have suggested that static , geometrically thin obscuring walls could be formed by the interplay between the radiation from the nucleus and a ring - like nuclear starburst .",
    "it would be more natural to assume that radiative feedback causes the dynamical evolution of the surrounding ism rather than static structures .",
    "@xcite calculated the net rate of momentum deposition due to the radiation pressure in the surrounding gas and estimated the mass - loss rate by outflow using monte carlo radiative transfer calculations .",
    "@xcite performed ` 2.5d ' ( i.e. basic equations are solved in three dimensions with axisymmetry ) radiative hydrodynamic simulations , and they found that an agn torus can be better described in terms of a radiationally supported flow rather than a quasi - static obscuring torus . using 2d simulations , @xcite studied the evolution of dusty clouds irradiated by the agn and found that the radiative transfer effect is significant depending on the column density of the clouds . as is usual in multi - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "cirtain simplifications have been applied in these previous studies , such as assuming flux - limited diffusion approximation and introducing symmetry for the rotational axis and equatorial plane of the agn . in this study",
    ", we examine the effect of the radiation from the central source on the ism by assuming a different set of simplifications .",
    "we performed fully three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations on scale of a few tens pc around an agn without introducing any symmetries .",
    "we took into account radiative heating and pressure due to `` direct radiation '' from the central source along rays for all the @xmath5 grid cells ; however , we ignored the phenomenon of scattering / re - emission .",
    "this is a natural extension of our previous three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of tens - of - parsec scale tori @xcite , in which self - gravity of the ism , radiative cooling , sne , and uv heating were taken into account .",
    "here , we report the first results without sne feedback .",
    "the sed analysis based on the present model will appear elsewhere ( schartmann and wada , in prep . ) . in this study",

    "the only explicit radiation source used here is an accretion disk whose size is five orders of magnitude smaller than the grid size in the present calculations .",
    "therefore we assumed that radiation is emitted from a point source .",

    "this approximation is not necessarily correct especially with respect to optically thick dusty gas around the central few parsecs ; however , beyond this region , the acceleration of the gas due to strong x - rays can be expected to be radial . even for the central region",
    "spanning a few parsecs , @xcite showed that the gas acceleration is nearly radial using three - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer calculations .",

    "figure [ wada_fig : f5 ] shows that the covering fraction of the central source is smaller in agns with lower luminosity .",
    "this is because more mass can be ejected from the central region to higher latitudes , and as a result , the radiation from the agn is self - obscured .",

    "they also found that the type-1 fraction is independent of the eddington ratio for its value between 0.01 and 1 , if only high density ( @xmath119 ) gas in the torus contributes to the obscuration ; this is also the case as seen in fig .",
    "[ wada_fig : f4 ] .",
    "further , this study shows that the global structures of the torus and outflows are not static , and there is never a perfect symmetry in terms of the equatorial plane and the rotation axis ( fig .",

    "the opening angle of the torus and other structures could be affected by the choice of the central radiation source . in this study",

    "<S> we propose a plausible mechanism to explain the formation of the so - called `` obscuring tori '' around active galactic nuclei ( agns ) based on three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including radiative feedback from the central source . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray heating and radiation pressure on the gas are explicitly calculated using a ray - tracing method . </S>",
    "<S> this radiation feedback drives a `` fountain '' , that is , a vertical circulation of gas in the central a few to tens parsecs . </S>",
    "<S> interaction between the non - steady outflows and inflows causes the formation of a geometrically thick torus with internal turbulent motion . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the agn is obscured for a wide range of solid angles . in a quasi - steady state , the opening angles for the column density toward a black hole @xmath0 @xmath1 are approximately @xmath2 and @xmath3 for agns with 10% and 1% eddington luminosity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> mass inflows through the torus coexist with the outflow and internal turbulent motion , and the average mass accretion rate to the central parsec region is @xmath4 ; this is about ten times smaller than accretion rate required to maintain the agn luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that relatively luminous agn activity is intrinsically intermittent or that there are other mechanisms , such as stellar energy feedback , that enhance the mass accretion to the center . </S>"
