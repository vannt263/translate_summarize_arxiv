    "in dynamical systems theory , chaos is usually defined on the basis of the exponential departure of infinitesimally separated initial conditions .",
    "the exponential law stems from the linearity of the equations that govern infinitesimal perturbations . in applications , however , errors are typically _",
    "finite_. this occurs , for instance , in the breeding method used to generate finite perturbations for ensemble forecasting at the national centers for environmental prediction ( usa )  @xcite .",
    "bred vectors are closely related to lyapunov vectors ( lvs ) albeit different since they are finite by construction and result from the evolution of perturbations , which are imposed to have a certain size via periodic normalizations .",
    "one advantage of bred vectors in applications is that the model under study does not have to be linearized , in contrast with lvs .",
    "( keep in mind that the linearization of a meteorological model is a delicate question due to the presence of nondifferentiable or discrete programming structures , see e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "the drawback is that bred vectors are governed by fully nonlinear models , what constitutes a challenge for their theoretical description .    in this article",
    "we use a special class of bred vector , the so - called _ logarithmic bred vector _",
    "( log - bv )  @xcite , which has the particularity of being normalized using the geometric ( or zero ) norm .",
    "this choice has proven to be the most convenient for spatially extended systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and offers some advantages in theoretical terms .",
    "we will focus on two aspects of bred vectors : first , we uncover common structural properties of log - bvs and the leading lv . in the second part of the paper we study the growth rate of log - bvs , which we shall refer to as _ bred exponents _ ( bes ) instead of the more imprecise term finite - size lyapunov exponents  @xcite for the sake of brevity and to emphasize their origin .",
    "we find an interesting relation between bes and lyapunov exponents ( les ) of spatio - temporally chaotic systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ lorenz96 ] we introduce the lorenz 96 model , which we will use throughout this contribution in order to illustrate our considerations . for the parameter values",
    "selected the lorenz 96 is hyperchaotic and exhibits spatio - temporal chaos . in the following section we explain the computation of log - bvs .",
    "a surface picture is introduced for the leading lv in sec .",
    "[ sgfa ] and extended to analyze log - bvs in sec .",
    "[ sgfb ] . in sec .",
    "[ gr ] we study the growth rates ( _ i.e. _ , bes ) of log - bvs . in sec",
    ".  [ sr ] the convergence to the largest le is found to obey a scaling relation . in sec .",
    "[ non - leading ] we explain how the bes are related to the spectrum of les .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the lorenz 96 model  @xcite is a toy model originally proposed in the context of atmospheric dynamics and used extensively to test novel techniques and applications .",
    "it is a time continuous model consisting of a set of nonlinear odes coupled in a ring geometry : @xmath0 @xmath1 can be seen as a scalar meteorological variable , _",
    "e.g. _  temperature , at @xmath2 equally spaced sites @xmath3 on a latitude circle ( and hence periodic boundary conditions are assumed ) .",
    "moreover , there is an external forcing constant @xmath4 that mimics the solar driving of the atmosphere .",
    "for @xmath5 the solutions of ( [ lorenz ] ) are chaotic if @xmath4 is large enough .",
    "in particular the steady solution @xmath6 becomes unstable if @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a more detailed study shows that stable nonchaotic solutions survive up to a value of @xmath4 that , though depending on @xmath2 , is approximately in the range 4 to 6 @xcite . beyond some threshold value of @xmath4 , chaotic dynamics of the model",
    "becomes fully developed .",
    "more precisely , the dynamics is extensive with @xmath2 ( see e.g. results in @xcite for @xmath8 ) .",
    "extensivity means that many relevant quantities ( dimension , entropy , etc . ) scale linearly with the system size , and the les @xmath9 converge to a density in the `` thermodynamic '' limit @xmath10 .",
    "this property is shared by a number of extended dynamical systems ranging from coupled map lattices to pdes such as the kuramoto - sivahinsky or the complex ginzburg - landau equations @xcite .    in order",
    "to compute bred and lyapunov vectors and their growth rates in the lorenz 96 model , we integrate eq .",
    "( [ lorenz ] ) and its linearization ( tangent space ) by using a fourth order runge - kutta - solver with time step @xmath11 . before measuring the quantities we are interested in",
    ", we allow the system to breed log - bvs for a transient time @xmath12 .",
    "in 1993 , toth and kalnay @xcite created a special operational cycle designed to `` breed '' fast growing errors in meteorological models .",
    "it uses finite perturbations that are periodically normalized to become bred vectors after some breeding cycles .    in the following",
    "we describe the procedure to compute bred vectors in mathematical terms .",
    "a control ( unperturbed ) trajectory @xmath13_{x=1}^{x = l}$ ] and a perturbed one @xmath14_{x=1}^{x = l}$ ] are evolved in parallel obeying eq .",
    "( [ lorenz ] ) .",
    "the difference between the perturbed and unperturbed trajectories is calculated every time interval @xmath15 , say at times @xmath16 , with @xmath17 to obtain @xmath18 these differences are then scaled down at @xmath19 to a given perturbation amplitude @xmath20 by defining @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the bred vector at time @xmath23 , and is @xmath24 a particular norm .",
    "the perturbed trajectory is then redefined by means of the bred vector : @xmath25 with @xmath26 referring to the same time @xmath23 , but after the rescaling .",
    "perturbed and unperturbed trajectories are again integrated forward in parallel until next rescaling scheduled at time @xmath27 .",
    "the definition of the bred vector contains two ingredients .",
    "one is the parameter @xmath20 controlling the amplitude . the second ingredient is the norm to be used since different norms will produce different bred vectors . in recent works",
    "@xcite it was found that the @xmath28-norm ( or geometric norm ) @xmath29^{1/q } = \\prod_{x=1}^{l } |\\delta u ( x , t)|^{1/l},\\ ] ] is a convenient choice for breeding . due to the multiplicative character of the linear dynamics the @xmath28-norm ought to produce bred vectors that , at different times , @xmath23 are the most statistically equivalent among them .",
    "the bred vectors constructed in this way are called _ logarithmic _ bred vectors ( log - bvs ) @xcite .",
    "before starting our analysis of the log - bvs it is useful to recall recent results concerning the structure of the main ( or leading ) lv . in a dynamical system",
    "an infinitesimal perturbation evolves generically towards the leading lyapunov vector @xmath30 , which indicates the direction of maximal growth for perturbations integrated since the remote past .",
    "the orientation of the lv in tangent space depends on the position in the chaotic attractor ( that can be parametrized by time ) . for extended chaotic systems , it is observed that the lv projects very inhomogeneously on space .",
    "more precisely , the vector localizes at some quite narrow region of the system @xcite . but noticeably , this localization is dynamic and the localization center changes as time evolves , thus recovering the homogeneity of the system in a statistical sense . in the 90s pikovsky and coworkers",
    "@xcite found very useful for the theoretical analysis to associate a `` surface '' with the leading lv by means of a hopf - cole transformation , which in @xmath31 dimension reads : @xmath32 with @xmath33_{x=1}^{x = l}$ ] . for a large family of systems @xcite , including the lorenz 96 model  @xcite , @xmath34 exhibits correlations in space and time which are described by the canonical kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation of stochastic surface growth @xcite .",
    "this mapping leads to interesting scaling properties for @xmath34 .",
    "the average width @xmath35 scales with the length of the system @xcite as @xmath36 ; with @xmath37 as in the kpz equation in one dimension .",
    "this means that , at sufficiently long scales , @xmath34 appears as the path of a random walk in @xmath31 .",
    "this self - affine profile translates into a power - law dependence of the structure factor ( a spatial power spectrum ) at small wavenumbers : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . at short length scales , @xmath41 ,",
    "non - universal short - range correlations are expected to appear due to the deterministic character of the system . however , below @xmath42 universal scaling properties emerge and this is reflected in a spatial correlation that generically decays as @xmath43 in one dimension .",
    "analogously to the surface associated with the leading lv in eq .",
    "( [ lyapuhopfcole ] ) , one can define a surface @xmath44 by hopf - cole transforming the log - bv of amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "the main lv evolves following linear equations and , therefore , only its direction in tangent space matters .",
    "however for a bred vector the norm plays a very important role through the periodic rescaling of the perturbations defined above .",
    "if the geometric norm is chosen , the spatial mean of the associated log - bv surface is fixed to a given size @xmath20 : @xmath45 in the limit of small amplitude @xmath46 , the log - bv aligns with the leading lyapunov vector , and their profiles coincide , @xmath47 , apart from an arbitrary constant due to the arbitrary norm ( i.e.  arbitrary @xmath48 ) of the leading lv .",
    "this fact suggests that the leading lv can be a good reference point to analyze the structure of log - bvs . in fig .",
    "[ difffields ] we show a snapshot of the difference fields @xmath49 we can see that , unless @xmath20 is too large , @xmath50 is mainly composed of plateaus , which indicates that the structure of @xmath51 is roughly a piecewise copy of @xmath34 .",
    "remarkably , this structure has been previously observed for lv - surfaces associated with les @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) smaller than the largest one @xmath54 @xcite . for the log - bvs the typical plateau size decreases as @xmath20",
    "is increased , whereas for the sub - dominant lvs the plateau size is known @xcite to decrease as the index @xmath55 is increased ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this suggests an interesting relation between both ( lyapunov and bred ) vector types that is exploited below in sec .",
    "[ non - leading ] .",
    "note also that primo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite used the surface ( [ surflbv ] ) to uncover several spatio - temporal scaling relations that already revealed in an indirect way the existence of cut - off lengths .",
    "these cut - off lengths are now apparent in the light of the plateaus in fig .",
    "[ plateaus ] .",
    "we now focus on the ( exponential ) growth rate of log - bvs , which we will refer to as bred exponents ( bes ) .",
    "we define the bes as : @xmath57 with @xmath15 denoting the time between rescalings .",
    "@xmath58 can be seen as a type of finite - size lyapunov exponent , see appendix a of @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath58 is not very sensitive to @xmath15 if @xmath15 remains small . in our simulations we chose @xmath15 such that the perturbation does not amplify more than @xmath59 times in a breeding cycle , so we take @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the largest le .",
    "first of all , it is convenient to transform eq .",
    "( [ be1 ] ) , using eq .",
    "( [ defhm ] ) : @xmath62 \\label{be2}\\ ] ] this expresses in mathematical terms that the be is the average velocity of the log - bv - surface . in the transformation of ( [ be1 ] ) into ( [ be2 ] ) we are assuming the geometric norm .",
    "again , this choice makes plenty of sense because the geometric norm actually yields the least - fluctuating le in systems with spatiotemporal chaos @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we explore the dependence of the bes , @xmath63 , on the amplitude @xmath20 and on the system size @xmath2 .",
    "note that in the limit of vanishing amplitude one recovers the largest le of the system : @xmath64    the key step of our following analysis is the use of the associated surfaces and the universal scaling laws they obey .",
    "let us denote by @xmath65 the le of the model with infinite size . as already reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the le of a system of size @xmath2 , @xmath66 deviates from the infinite size limit as @xmath67 this stems from the fact that @xmath66 is the velocity of the associated surface , that scales as solutions of the kpz equation : the asymptotic velocity of a kpz - surface presents a system - size correction  @xcite of order @xmath68 , with @xmath37 one dimension .",
    "for the dependence of the be on @xmath20 we resort to very simple arguments .",
    "following the reasonings in @xcite let us assume a log - bv is ( locally ) linear whenever @xmath69 , for a certain bound @xmath70 .",
    "this bound defines borders of regions of size @xmath71 where the log - bv - surface is approximately a copy of the leading lv - surface .",
    "the kpz surface is self affine , and recalling eq .",
    "( [ defhm ] ) , we expect the scaling law @xmath72 to be fulfilled . taking into account that the velocity is shifted from the asymptotic value by the inverse of the size , _",
    "@xmath73 : @xmath74 this relation is not the asymptotic one because when @xmath20 becomes extremely small the `` nonlinear barrier '' at @xmath75 is seldom achieved and the dominant correction is given by eq .",
    "( [ scaling2 ] ) .",
    "scaling relations ( [ scaling2 ] ) and ( [ scaling1 ] ) can be cast into @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is a scaling function : for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , as expected from ( [ scaling2 ] ) ; whereas for @xmath81 , @xmath78 should scale as @xmath82 , according to ( [ scaling1 ] ) . using the data from our simulations we can test the validity of this scaling law .",
    "figure  [ figscaling ] shows a very good collapse with just one fitting parameter , @xmath83 , for different system sizes and values of @xmath20 .",
    "our scaling argument is in good agreement with numerical data shown in fig .",
    "[ figscaling ] , where one can see how the @xmath81 asymptote converges to @xmath84 ( shaded region in fig .  [ figscaling ] ) . however , the approximation appears to be too crude to describe the behavior very close to the crossover point @xmath85 , where the functional form of @xmath78 deviates from the asymptote .",
    "nonetheless the correct scaling variable @xmath86 for the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) and the two asymptotes are correctly captured .",
    "the crossover of @xmath78 at @xmath87 marks the departure from a regime dominated by the finite - size system effects to the dominance of the amplitude @xmath20 of the log - bv .      in the preceding subsection",
    "we have introduced the concept of bred vector exponent @xmath58 as the growth rate for a log - bv of amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "we have also seen how this be approaches the leading le in a finite size system as the amplitude @xmath20 is varied .",
    "now we devote the present subsection to study the connection of the bes with the spectrum of les .",
    "the question we want to address is to what extent growth rates of log - bvs ( finite errors ) approach growth rates of lvs ( infinitesimal errors ) .      from the scaling arguments discussed above",
    ", it can be expected that the be @xmath58 ought to be close to the @xmath55-th lyapunov exponent @xmath52 whenever both of them are piecewise copies of the leading lyapunov vector with similar plateau sizes .",
    "this hypothesis reads more formally : @xmath88 where @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) indicates the typical length scale over which the log - bv ( the @xmath55-th lv ) surface is a piecewise copy of the leading lv . in the following",
    "we will drop the superindices @xmath91 and @xmath92 , as it is clear from the argument ( @xmath20 or @xmath55 ) what vector type we are referring to .      in sec .",
    "[ sgfb ] we showed that log - bvs are piecewise copies of the main lv .",
    "this observation is now exploited to obtain a connection between bes and les . in order to do so",
    ", we find it very convenient to look at the form of spatial correlations in fourier space .",
    "the structure factors of log - bv - surfaces with different values of @xmath20 are presented in fig .",
    "[ strucfacdemo ] . as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ plateaus ] the log - bv - surface follows the leading lv - surface at short scales and , as a consequence , their respective structure factors should overlap above a certain @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that both ( log - bv and lv ) surface types share an interval @xmath94 with power - law structure factor @xmath95 .",
    "log - bvs exhibit flat structure factors for @xmath96 smaller than a certain @xmath93 , which indicates that distant regions ( corresponding to small @xmath96 ) are basically uncorrelated .",
    "the crossover wavenumber @xmath97 is monotonically increasing with @xmath20 and , from eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , we have @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "notably , surfaces associated with lvs for @xmath100 have a structure factor that also exhibits a knee at a certain crossover wavenumber @xmath101 @xcite . in sum , structure factors of lv - surfaces and log - bv - surfaces are very similar ( cf .",
    "fig .  4 in @xcite ) , and they only differ in the algebraic dependence below the particular crossover wavenumber @xmath102 : @xmath103-type for the lvs , and flat ( @xmath104 ) for the log - bvs @xcite , reflecting their different spatial correlations at large scales .",
    "the crossover wavenumbers @xmath93 of the log - bv - surfaces @xmath51 can be systematically extracted from their structure factors @xmath105 , see fig .",
    "[ strucfacdemo ] for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "figure [ collapse ] shows the collapse of different structure factors when normalizing the wavenumbers by @xmath93 , giving an idea of the goodness of the estimation of @xmath93 .",
    "figures [ sofk1024 ] and [ sofk128 ] show that the same procedure can be used for other values of @xmath4 and smaller systems .      in extended systems",
    ", it is customary to represent les with the index @xmath55 normalized by the system size ( or by the number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this is done so to highlight the extensivity ( assuming it exists ) of the model because les for different systems sizes with identical parameter values will approximately fall on the same line .",
    "figure [ bexp1024 ] shows the les connected by black lines .",
    "the lyapunov spectra were obtained using the standard algorithm by benettin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we found in ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive coupled map lattice that @xmath108 , with @xmath109 around one .",
    "this means that representing the les versus @xmath110 is , for moderate values of @xmath55 , equivalent to use a quantity proportional to @xmath101 in the @xmath3-axis .    if now we want to test our hypothesis that bes and les are similar if the crossover length scales coincide , we have to normalize @xmath93 to use it as an independent variable in the range @xmath111 .",
    "this normalization yields @xmath112 , and we may see in fig .",
    "[ bexp1024 ] that indeed bes and les fall very near in the first part of the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "this range of approximate overlapping is limited by the value of @xmath55 ( or @xmath20 ) up to which the lvs ( or the log - bvs ) are piecewise copies of the main lv .",
    "note also that this range expands as @xmath4 increases and the system becomes more chaotic .",
    "figures  [ sofk128 ] and [ bexp128 ] show that the same procedure can be followed also for a smaller system size ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "note that as the system is extensive the figures look very much the same as those for @xmath106 .",
    "although dynamical systems theory can characterize essentially all the properties of a chaotic system in terms of the properties of the tangent space directions ( lvs ) and their associated growth rates , the use of these linear analysis tools in real applications is often restricted by practical limits .",
    "this is particularly obvious in atmospheric dynamics and weather prediction systems were operative models include mathematical subtleties like ad - hoc parametrizations of many physical processes , nondifferentiable structures , and discrete programming structures that render the model unsuitable for linearization . in this context",
    ", much insight has been achieved by studying finite amplitude and truly nonlinear perturbations . in particular bvs",
    "have attracted much attention as a tool to investigate propagation of errors in both toy and operative weather models .",
    "however , little was known about the relation of finite bvs and truly infinitesimal lvs , apart from the obvious fact that a bv should tend to be collinear with the leading lv as the bv amplitude @xmath20 tends to zero ( independently of the norm definition used ) .    in this paper",
    "we have uncovered a number of connections between bred and lyapunov vectors , which are specially noticeable and most conveniently characterized when one uses the zero - norm bvs or log - bvs .",
    "we have also found that these similarities appear over a spatial range , below some characteristic length scale , that depends on the bvs amplitude .",
    "after a hopf - cole transformation , the log - bvs turn out to be a piecewise copy of the leading lv .",
    "this resembles what has been previously reported for non - leading lvs  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the spatial structure of log - bvs shows clearly that they are uncorrelated objects at long length scales over certain characteristic length .",
    "this contrasts with lvs that were shown to exhibit weak correlations ( decaying as @xmath103 with the wavenumber ) at long scales  @xcite .",
    "this immediately implies that the relative heights of the plateaus relating log - bvs and the lv are not constrained by the dynamics . in turn",
    "different initial conditions yield a diversity of log - bvs but nonetheless similar local patterns .",
    "interestingly , this `` regional '' coincidence was observed before in bred vectors of a global circulation model of the atmosphere @xcite , but remained up to now unexplained .",
    "here we have shown that this regional similarities of bvs of different amplitudes @xmath20 may be understood as due to the overlapping with the leading lv below a certain spatial range .",
    "this paper has also investigated the relation between the growth rate of log - bvs ( the bes ) and the les .",
    "we have introduced the concept of bred exponents that describe how nonlinear perturbations grow in time .",
    "we have found that bes and les can be mapped onto each other when the crossover length scales of the corresponding vector perturbations coincide .",
    "this is only true for the most expanding ( bred or lyapunov ) exponents , when the `` piecewise kpz '' picture holds .",
    "the convergence of the be ( a finite - time le ) to the largest le has been found to follow a generic scaling function , which has been explained by a simple argument .",
    "finally , it is to be emphasized that we have used the lorenz 96 model in our simulations , but very similar results should be expected for other dissipative systems with spatiotemporal chaos .",
