    "<S> contrary to common perceptions about systems produced in singleexchange ( spe ) @xmath0 interactions , the hard diffractive process discovered at the cern collider leads to dominant central production of higgs bosons at the lhc . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , an spe measurement program of dijet events is outlined for the early days of lhc running which should answer many fundamental questions about the structure and its effective flux factor in the proton .    </S>",
