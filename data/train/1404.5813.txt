    "@xmath5    a crucial ingredient in the topological approach to theoretical distributed computing , see  herlihy et al , @xcite , is associating a  simplicial complex , called the _ protocol complex _ , to every distributed protocol , once the computational model is fixed . in this paper , we study topology of standard full - information protocol complexes in one of the central models of computation .",
    "let us fix the computational model to be the immediate snapshot read / write model , which was originally introduced by borowsky and gafni in  @xcite .",
    "roughly , this means that the processes can write their values to the assigned memory registers , and they can read the entire memory in one atomic step ( snapshot read ) . the execution of the protocol must have a layer structure , where in each layer a group of processes becomes active , the processes in this group atomically write their values to the memory , after this they atomically read the entire memory .",
    "importantly , there are no further restrictions on how these layers get activated during the protocol execution .    in our previous work , @xcite",
    ", we introduced combinatorial models for the protocol complexes for the standard protocols in that chosen computational model , called _ immediate snapshot complexes_. for this , we needed to define new combinatorial structures , called _ witness structures _ , and study their structure theory , including various operations , such as _ ghosting_.",
    "we have proved that the immediate snapshot complexes provide the correct model for these protocol complexes , and started to study their topology .",
    "the standard protocols are naturally enumerated by finite sequences of nonnegative integers , which we called _ round counters _ , denoted @xmath6 .",
    "accordingly , the immediate snapshot complexes themselves were denoted @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that the complexes @xmath0 are always pseudomanifolds with boundary , and the combinatorics of the boundary subcomplex was described .    in this paper , we improve our understanding of topology of @xmath0 significantly .",
    "we refine the notion of canonical subcomplex decomposition of @xmath0 from @xcite , and give a  complete combinatorial description of the incidence relations in this stratification .",
    "this gives us a  good approach to understanding the inner structure of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , it is straightforward to prove the contractibility of @xmath0 by pairing the combinatorial description of this incidence structure with the standard result in combinatorial topology , called the _ nerve lemma _ , see  @xcite . as a  first topological property",
    "we show a  stronger result : namely , that the complexes @xmath0 are always collapsible .",
    "the collapsing sequence is also explicitly described .",
    "it takes much more effort to derive the second topological property of @xmath0 , namely the fact that each such complex is homeomorphic to a  closed ball of dimension @xmath7 .",
    "this is the content of the corollary  [ crl : main ] , which is an immediate consequence of our main theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "specifically , we prove that , for every @xmath0 , there exists a  homeomorphism @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 is a subcomplex of @xmath0 , whenever @xmath3 is a simplex in the simplicial complex @xmath4 .",
    "the work presented here is the rigorous workout of the second part of the preprint @xcite .",
    "the detailed expansion of the first part of  @xcite has already appeared in @xcite , where we laid the combinatorial groundwork for the topological results of this paper .",
    "we spend the rest of this section reminding the notations of  @xcite and results proved there .",
    "our presentation here is quite condensed and the reader is referred to  @xcite for further details .",
    "we remark that topology of protocol complexes for related computational models has been studied by many authors , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we recommend attiya and welch , @xcite , for an  in - depth background on theoretical distributed computing .    fundamentally , this paper can be viewed a  stand - alone article , written in a  rigorous mathematical fashion , making it possible , in principle , to be read independently .",
    "however , we strongly recommend that the reader consults @xcite , before starting reading this one . furthermore , in order both to facilitate researchers who are mainly interested in distributed computing , as well as topologists interested in more distributed computing background , we shall comment throughout the text , explaining the distributed computing intuition behind the mathematical concepts .",
    "@xmath5    to start with , we review some of the standard terminology which we will use .",
    "we let @xmath8 denote the set of nonnegative integers @xmath9 . for a natural number @xmath10",
    "we shall use @xmath11 $ ] to denote the set @xmath12 , with a convention that @xmath13={\\emptyset}$ ] . for a  finite subset @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 , we let @xmath16 denote the _ second _ largest element , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "finally , for a set @xmath18 and an element @xmath19 , we set @xmath20 furthermore , whenever @xmath21 is a  family of topological spaces , we set @xmath22 . also ,",
    "when no confusion arises , we identify one - element sets with that element , and write , e.g. , @xmath23 instead of @xmath24 .",
    "next , we proceed to the combinatorial enumeration of all standard protocols , together with relation terminology .",
    "this is accomplished by the introduction of the so - called _ round counters_.    given a function @xmath25 , we consider the set @xmath26 this set is called the * support set * of @xmath6 .",
    "a * round counter * is a function @xmath25 with a  finite support set .",
    "obviously , a  round counter can be thought of as an infinite sequence @xmath27 , where , for all @xmath28 , either @xmath29 is a nonnegative integer , or @xmath30 , such that only finitely many entries of @xmath6 are nonnegative integers .",
    "we shall frequently use a  short - hand notation @xmath31 to denote the round counter given by @xmath32    given a round counter @xmath6 , the number @xmath33 is called the * cardinality * of @xmath6 , and is denoted @xmath34 .",
    "the sets @xmath35 are called the * active * and the * passive * sets of  @xmath6 .",
    "since we consider full - information protocols only , they can be described by specifying the number of rounds each process executes the write - read sequence .",
    "mathematically , these protocols are indexed by round counters . given a  round counter @xmath6 , the set @xmath36 indexes the participating processes , and is required to be finite .",
    "the symbol @xmath37 means that the process does not participate .",
    "accordingly , the set @xmath38 indexes the passive processes , i.e. , those , which formally take part in the execution , but which do not actually perform any active steps , while the set @xmath39 indexes the processes which execute at least one step .    the following special class of round counters",
    "is important for our study .    for an arbitrary pair of disjoint finite sets",
    "@xmath40 we define a  round counter @xmath41 given by @xmath42    furthermore , for an arbitrary round counter @xmath6 , we set @xmath43 .",
    "we note that @xmath44 . in the paper",
    "we shall also use the short - hand notation @xmath45 .",
    "we define two operations on the round counters . to start with ,",
    "assume @xmath6 is a  round counter and we have a  subset @xmath46 .",
    "we let @xmath47 denote the round counter defined by @xmath48 we say that the round counter @xmath47 is obtained from @xmath6 by the _ deletion _ of  @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath53 .",
    "finally , we note for future reference that for @xmath54 we have @xmath55    for the second operation , assume @xmath6 is a  round counter and we have a  subset @xmath56 .",
    "we let @xmath57 denote the round counter defined by @xmath58 we say that the round counter @xmath57 is obtained from @xmath6 by the _ execution _ of  @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "however , in general we have @xmath62 .    the replacement of @xmath6 with @xmath47 yields a new protocol , where all processes from @xmath49 have been banned from participation .",
    "the replacement of @xmath6 with @xmath57 corresponds to letting processes from @xmath18 execute one round , and then running the remaining protocol with new inputs .",
    "for an arbitrary round pointer @xmath6 and sets @xmath56 , @xmath63 we set @xmath64 in the special case , when @xmath65 , the identity specializes to @xmath66 when @xmath67 , we shall frequently use the short - hand notation @xmath68 instead of @xmath69 , in other words , @xmath70 .",
    "again , for future reference , we note that for @xmath71 , we have @xmath72      @xmath5    next , we describe the basic terminology which we will need to define the immediate snapshot complexes .
