    "the mean - field theory of spin glasses is well established @xcite .",
    "there exists a low - temperature spin glass phase with complex structure of the phase space with such characteristics as replica symmetry breaking , many valleys and slow dynamics . in contrast , investigations of realistic finite - dimensional systems have been hampered by difficulties of analytic treatment , and numerical methods have been the predominant tool of research .",
    "an interesting exception is the gauge theory which exploits gauge symmetry of the system to derive many exact / rigorous results such as the exact expression of the internal energy , a bound on the specific heat and various identities for correlation functions @xcite .",
    "it may be a little bit surprising that this gauge theory is closely related with some problems of information processing such as error - correcting codes and image restoration .",
    "suppose that one transmits digital information ( a bit sequence ) through a noisy channel .",
    "an important goal of error - correcting codes is to devise an efficient way to encode and decode the information in order to remove as much noise as possible from the output of the channel .",
    "this problem can be rewritten as an ising spin glass @xcite : a bit sequence is naturally expressed as an ising spin configuration , and noise corresponds to randomness in exchange interactions .",
    "then the statistical inference of the original information , given the noisy output of the channel , is found to be equivalent to the statistical mechanics of an ising spin glass .    a similar analogy exists between image restoration , in which one tries to remove noise from a given digital image , and the statistical mechanics of a spin system in random fields .",
    "it is the purpose of this contribution to review the gauge theory of spin glasses and information processing problems , error - correcting codes in particular , with emphasis on the similarities between these superficially quite different fields @xcite .",
    "the gauge theory of spin glasses and error - correcting codes are reviewed in sections 2 and 3 , respectively , with a few new results and viewpoints .",
    "summary is given in section 4 .",
    "the gauge theory of spin glasses is a powerful theoretical framework to derive a number of exact / rigorous results on models of spin glasses using gauge symmetry of the system .",
    "it does not answer directly the question of the existence or absence of the spin glass phase in finite dimensions .",
    "nevertheless this theory leads to various results which set strong constraints on the possibilities of the existence region of the spin glass phase in the phase diagram and other non - trivial conclusions @xcite .",
    "let us consider the @xmath0 ising model with the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 , a quenched random variable , is either @xmath3 ( with probability @xmath4 ) or @xmath5 ( with probability @xmath6 ) .",
    "the sum over @xmath7 runs over appropriate pairs of sites , such as ( but not restricted to ) nearest neighbours on a regular lattice .",
    "this probability distribution can be written in a compact form as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to check that ( [ prob_distribution ] ) is equal to @xmath4 if @xmath10 and is @xmath6 when @xmath11 if we define the parameter @xmath12 by @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ising_hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a set of ising variables fixed arbitrarily at each site .",
    "it is possible to derive the exact expression of the internal energy , averaged over the probability ( [ prob_distribution ] ) , under a simple condition between the temperature and the probability @xmath4 .",
    "the definition of the internal energy is @xmath16=\\sum_{\\ { \\tau_{ij}\\ } } \\prod_{\\langle ij \\rangle }      p(j_{ij } ) \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{\\ { s_i\\ } } h e^{-\\beta h } }                         { \\sum_{\\ { s_i\\ } } e^{-\\beta h } } ,              \\label{e_def}\\ ] ] where the square brackets @xmath17 $ ] denote the configurational average .",
    "the gauge transformation ( [ g - transformation ] ) just redefines the running variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 and therefore does not affect the value of the internal energy .",
    "thus ( [ e_def ] ) is rewritten as @xmath16= \\sum_{\\tau } \\frac{e^{k_p \\sum \\tau_{ij}\\sigma_i \\sigma_j } }     { ( 2\\cosh k_p)^{n_b}}\\cdot           \\frac{\\sum_s h e^{k\\sum \\tau_{ij}s_i s_j } }                { \\sum_s    e^{k\\sum \\tau_{ij}s_i s_j } } ,        \\label{e_gauge}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the number of bonds in the system and @xmath21 .",
    "since the value of ( [ e_gauge ] ) is independent of the choice of @xmath22 , we may sum the right hand side of ( [ e_gauge ] ) over all possible values of @xmath22 and divide the result by @xmath23 without changing the value of @xmath24 $ ] : @xmath16=\\frac{1}{(2\\cosh k_p)^{n_b } 2^n } \\sum_{\\tau } \\sum_{\\sigma }    e^{k_p\\sum \\tau_{ij } \\sigma_i \\sigma_j }     \\cdot           \\frac{\\sum_s h e^{k\\sum \\tau_{ij}s_i s_j } }                { \\sum_s    e^{k\\sum \\tau_{ij}s_i s_j}}.\\ ] ] it is clear here that the denominator on the right hand side cancels with the sum over @xmath25 if @xmath26 , which makes it possible to evaluate the energy explicitly : @xmath27&=&\\frac{1}{(2\\cosh k_p)^{n_b } 2^n } \\sum_{\\tau } \\sum_{s }         h e^{k\\sum",

    "so the present exact solution ( [ exact_energy ] ) is very generic .",
    "similar arguments lead to an upper bound on the specific heat and various identities for static correlation functions under the condition @xmath26 .      an interesting relation can be established for dynamical correlation functions using the gauge theory @xcite : @xmath28    = \\left [ \\left\\langle s_i(0 ) s_i(t ) \\right\\rangle_{k_p}^{\\rm eq } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{dynamical_correlation}\\ ] ] the right hand side is the equilibrium autocorrelation function at temperature @xmath26 . the left hand side is a non - equilibrium correlation function starting from the completely ferromagnetic state at time 0 .",
    "the first measurement is performed after waiting time @xmath29 and the second at @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamical_corr ] ) .    ) . ]",
    "if the systems shows anomalously slow dynamics , the non - equilibrium correlation function , the left hand side , will depend on the measurement starting time ( the waiting time @xmath29 ) as it actually happens in the spin glass phase of the mean - field model .",
    "otherwise , the system relaxes quickly to equilibrium , implying time - translation invariance , or equivalently , independence of the left hand side of @xmath29 . the identity ( [ dynamical_correlation ] ) proves that the latter possibility is the case since the right hand side does not depend on @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , any spin glass system does not show slow dynamics on the line @xmath26 .",
    "the proof of ( [ dynamical_correlation ] ) requires some background of the kinetic ising model and we refer the reader to the original papers .",
    "note that the above argument is not a proof of the absence of a spin glass phase in general .",
    "what has been shown is that a phase with slow dynamics should exist , if it does at all , away from the nishimori line .",
    "an interesting functional identity @xmath31 can be proved under the same condition @xmath26 @xcite . here , @xmath32 is the distribution function of magnetization and @xmath33 is the distribution of spin glass order parameter , @xmath34    \\label{ising - pm}\\ ] ] and @xmath35 .",
    "\\label{ising - pq}\\ ] ] the proof of the identity @xmath31 is relatively straightforward if we apply the gauge transformation to the expression ( [ ising - pm ] ) and use the condition @xmath26 .",
    "after the gauge transformation , ( [ ising - pm ] ) is expressed as @xmath36 the last expression is equivalent to ( [ ising - pq ] ) if @xmath26 .    since the distribution function of magnetization @xmath32 is always composed of at most two simple delta functions located at @xmath37 , the identity @xmath31 implies that the distribution of spin glass order parameter @xmath33 also has the same simple structure .",
    "this excludes the possibility that a complex structure of the phase space , which should be reflected in a non - trivial functional form of @xmath33 , exists on the line @xmath26 .",
    "thus a spin glass ( or mixed ferromagnetic ) phase of the mean - field type , if it exists , should lie away from the line in the phase diagram .",
    "this observation reinforces the conclusion of the previous subsection on dynamics that there is no mean - field type spin glass phase on the nishimori line .",
    "the arguments in the previous section on the gauge theory of spin glasses are in close formal similarity to some problems of information processing .",
    "we demonstrate it with error - correcting codes as a typical example @xcite .",
    "the goal of the theory of error - correcting codes is to find efficient methods to infer the original information ( bit sequence ) from the output of a noisy transmission channel . for this purpose",
    "it is known to be necessary to introduce redundancy before sending the information through the channel , a process called encoding ( or coding ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ecc ] . at the receiving end of the channel ,",
    "one decodes the signal to retrieve the original information making full use of the redundancy .",
    "shannon s channel coding theorem sets a lower limit on the redundancy in order to retrieve the original information without errors , given the noise strength of the channel .",
    "bits is encoded to a binary sequence of @xmath38 bits which is then transmitted through the noisy channel .",
    "the output of the channel is decoded to infer the original information . ]",
    "it is convenient to formulate the problem in terms of ising spins as natural correspondences exist between a bit and an ising spin ( 0 and 1 corresponds to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ) and between the mod - two addition and the multiplication ( e.g. , 1 + 1=0 is equivalent to @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "suppose that the original information one wishes to send is an ising spin configuration @xmath42 .",
    "redundancy can be introduced by generating a set of many - body mattis - type interactions @xcite from the spin configuration , @xmath43 .",
    "clearly the number of interactions @xmath20 is larger than the number of ising spins @xmath44 , implying redundancy .",
    "a specific choice of the set of sites to form interactions @xmath45 corresponds to a specific code .",
    "a search for a good code is one of the main targets of coding theory , but we do not review this problem here and continue the argument without specifying the set @xmath45 .    the encoded information @xmath46 is transmitted through the noisy channel .",
    "let us focus our attention on a binary symmetric channel in which the input @xmath47 is flipped to the opposite sign @xmath48 with error probability @xmath4 .",
    "the task is to infer ( decode ) the original information @xmath42 from the noisy output of the channel @xmath49 .",
    "note that frustration exists in the set of interactions @xmath50 although @xmath51 ( which was generated by the mattis rule ) is not frustrated .",
    "finite - temperature statistical mechanics of the ising spin glass with interactions @xmath50 serves as a useful theoretical platform to decode the message as shown in the following @xcite .",
    "the first step is to express the noise characteristics using the conditional probability as @xmath52 which is equal to @xmath4 if @xmath53 and @xmath6 otherwise if we define @xmath54 as @xmath55 note that @xmath54 is essentially equivalent to @xmath12 appeared in the previous section , the only difference being that @xmath4 and @xmath6 are exchanged . assuming a memoryless channel , in which each bit is affected by noise independently of other bits , the conditional probability of the whole spin configuration is @xmath56 where @xmath20 is the size of the set @xmath50 .",
    "equation ( [ cond_probability ] ) represents the conditional probability of the output @xmath50 given the input @xmath57 . to infer the original information , we need the conditional probability of the input @xmath57 given the output @xmath50 . the bayes formula is useful for this purpose : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a set of dynamical variables used to infer @xmath57 .",
    "we need the explicit form of the distribution function of the original information @xmath60 , called the prior , to use the bayes formula ( [ bayes ] ) to infer @xmath59 given @xmath50 .",
    "it can reasonably assumed that @xmath60 is a constant , a uniform prior , because one often compresses information before encoding , which usually generates a very uniform distribution of 0s and 1s .",
    "then the @xmath59-dependence of the right hand side comes only from @xmath61 , and thus we find @xmath62 the right hand side is the boltzmann factor of the ising spin glass with many body interactions which are quenched since @xmath50 is given and fixed . therefore the problem has been reduced to the statistical mechanics of the ising spin glass with the effective coupling @xmath54 .",
    "there are two typical methods to infer the original information ( spin configuration ) from the conditional probability ( [ posterior ] ) called the posterior .",
    "one is the map ( maximum a posteriori probability ) method in which one chooses the configuration @xmath59 that maximizes @xmath63 .",
    "this is equivalent to the ground - state search of the ising spin glass @xmath64 according to ( [ posterior ] ) .",
    "another is the mpm ( maximizer of posterior marginals ) method ; one first marginalizes the posterior with respect to @xmath65 @xmath66 and chooses @xmath65 to maximize this marginal probability .",
    "if we write the inferred value as @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 .",
    "such a process is carried out at each @xmath69 .",
    "the mpm is equivalent to looking at the sign of the local magnetization @xmath70 , where the thermal average is taken using the boltzmann factor ( [ posterior ] ) of the ising spin system with effective coupling @xmath54 .",
    "the map may be regarded as the same method @xmath70 , the only difference being that the thermal average is now evaluated at the ground state .",
    "thus these two methods may be called the ground - state decoding ( map ) and finite temperature decoding ( mpm ) , respectively .    an important measure of decoding performance",
    "is the overlap of the decoded information ( spin configuration ) @xmath71 and the original true information @xmath42 , @xmath72 ,         \\label{overlap_def}\\ ] ] where the square brackets denote the configurational average with respect to the distribution of noise ( or equivalently , quenched randomness in interactions ) .",
    "perfect decoding result gives @xmath73 whereas a random result yields @xmath74 .",
    "a larger @xmath75 represents a better result .",
    "it is useful to replace the parameter @xmath54 in ( [ posterior ] ) with a general @xmath76 because , first , the map ( @xmath77 ) and the mpm ( @xmath78 ) can be treated within the same framework and , second , one sometimes does not know the correct error rate @xmath4 ( and its function @xmath54 ) in applying the mpm . the overlap is then a function of @xmath76 and @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that the overlap @xmath79 as a function of @xmath76 is not monotonic but reaches the maximum at @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] ) @xcite : @xmath80        this non - monotonicity is not surprising intuitively because the overlap has been defined as a measure of average bitwise performance ( [ overlap_def ] ) and the mpm has been designed to maximize the bitwise posterior ( [ marginal ] ) .",
    "the proof of the inequality ( [ m_inequality ] ) will be given in the next subsection .",
    "the inequality ( [ m_inequality ] ) has the following interesting interpretation in the context of spin glasses .",
    "let us consider the problem in terms of the ferromagnetic gauge , @xmath81 .",
    "generality is not lost by this restriction because the prior has been assumed to be uniform , @xmath82const , and thus all the original configurations have the same statistical properties , leading to the same average decoding performance @xmath79 for any choice of @xmath42 .    in the ferromagnetic gauge the overlap @xmath83 represents the average of the difference between the numbers of up spins and down spins : @xmath84       = \\left [ { \\rm sgn}\\langle \\sigma_i \\rangle \\right ] .",
    "\\label{overlap_ferrogauge}\\ ] ] it should also be noticed that ( [ posterior ] ) is equivalent to the boltzmann factor of the @xmath0 ising model with many body interactions only for the ferromagnetic gauge , strictly speaking .",
    "the reason is that the interaction @xmath85 is equal to @xmath86 with probability @xmath6 and to @xmath87 with probability @xmath4 only in the ferromagnetic gauge .",
    "thus the effective inverse temperature @xmath54 in ( [ posterior ] ) represents the condition that the system is on the nishimori line @xmath88 in the ferromagnetic gauge ( with @xmath4 and @xmath6 exchanged from the notation of section 2 ) .",
    "to prove ( [ m_inequality ] ) in the ferromagnetic gauge , we first write ( [ overlap_ferrogauge ] ) explicitly : @xmath89      = \\frac{1}{(2\\cosh \\beta_p)^{n_b } } \\sum_{\\tau } e^{\\beta_p\\sum \\tau_{ij } }     \\frac{\\sum_{\\sigma } \\sigma_i e^{\\beta\\sum \\tau_{ij } \\sigma_i \\sigma_j } }     { |\\sum_{\\sigma } \\sigma_i e^{\\beta\\sum \\tau_{ij } \\sigma_i \\sigma_j}|}.\\ ] ] then , by applying the gauge transformation ( with gauge variable @xmath90 ) and evaluating the upper bound by taking the absolute value of the summand , we find @xmath91      & = & \\frac{1}{2^n ( 2\\cosh \\beta_p)^{n_b } } \\sum_{\\eta } \\sum_{\\sigma }      e^{\\beta_p\\sum \\tau_{ij}\\eta_i \\eta_j } \\langle \\eta_i \\rangle_{\\beta_p }       \\frac{\\langle \\sigma_i \\rangle_{\\beta } }              { |\\langle \\sigma_i \\rangle_{\\beta}| }      \\nonumber\\\\     & \\le & \\frac{1}{2^n ( 2\\cosh \\beta_p)^{n_b } }",
    "\\sum_{\\eta } \\sum_{\\sigma }      e^{\\beta_p\\sum \\tau_{ij}\\eta_i \\eta_j } |\\langle \\eta_i \\rangle_{\\beta_p}| .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last expression is easily seen to be equal to @xmath92= m(\\beta_p , p)$ ] if we apply the gauge transformation to @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "the inequality ( [ m_inequality ] ) is interpreted that the number of up spins , relative to the number of down spins , is a non - monotonic function of the temperature .",
    "the number of up spins reaches its maximum on the nishimori line and then decreases as one further lowers the temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] ) . in this sense , the spin state on the nishimori line is more ordered than the states at any other temperature with the same @xmath4 .",
    "this is a highly non - trivial result .",
    "as one lowers the temperature from the paramagnetic phase , the number of up spins becomes to exceed that of down spins as soon as the system enters the ferromagnetic phase ( point a in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram2 ] ) if one imposes the boundary condition such that the overall inversion symmetry is broken for the system with two - body interactions .",
    "the number of up spins reaches the maximum on the nishimori line , where , in some sense , thermal fluctuations are balanced with geometrical frustration ( point b ) . then , as one further lowers the temperature , the spin states start to capture the detailed structure of bond configurations , which were masked by thermal fluctuations above the nishimori line , and the number of up spins starts to decrease at lowering the temperatures ( point c ) .",
    "it should be remembered here that the magnetization @xmath93 $ ] , not the overlap @xmath94 $ ] , is of course expected to be a monotonic function of the temperature .",
    "only the number of up spins @xmath83 , which ignores the spin - size reduction due to thermal fluctuations ( latexmath:[$|\\langle \\sigma_i \\rangle| <    therefore conclude that the nishimori line marks the crossover between the purely ferromagnetic region ( where @xmath75 increases as the temperature is decreased ) and a randomness - dominated region ( where @xmath75 decreases ) .",
    "this observation is reinforced by the fact that the ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath96 is equal to the spin glass order @xmath97 on the nishimori line as can be derived from the functional identity @xmath31 mentioned in section 2 : we reasonably expect that the ferromagnetic order dominates @xmath98 above the nishimori line and the opposite is true @xmath99 below .",
    "another interesting and useful aspect concerning the relation ( or equivalence ) between the ising spin glass and error - correcting codes is the simplicity of phase space and the absence of slow dynamics on the nishimori line discussed in section 2 .",
    "practical algorithms of decoding are generally implemented as iterative solutions of tap - like equations for local magnetizations .",
    "such iterations can be regarded as discrete - time dynamics of the ising spin glass .",
    "and the iteration is often carried out on the nishimori line to achieve the best performance in the sense of maximum overlap @xmath75 .",
    "then , if the system shows slow dynamics , the iteration may not converge to the desired result in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "the results in section 2 guarantee that this does not happen .",
    "exact / rigorous results have been presented on static and dynamical properties of the ising spin glass using the gauge theory .",
    "these results have been shown to restrict the possibilities of complex structure of the phase space and slow dynamics of the mean - field type .",
    "we have presented a baysian formulation of error - correcting codes that has a very close formal similarity to the ising spin glass .",
    "the best bitwise inference of the original information has been shown to be achieved by a finite - temperature decoding corresponding to the nishimori line derived in the gauge theory of spin glasses .",
    "we have seen that an inequality on the overlap , which is a measure of decoding performance of error - correcting codes , has an interesting interpretation under the context of spin glasses that the average spin orientation is not a monotonic function of the temperature .",
    "the spin ordering , in the sense of the number of up spins ( ignoring the spin reduction due to thermal fluctuations ) , takes its maximum value not at @xmath100 but at a finite temperature corresponding to the nishimori line .",
    "thus the system of ising spin glass is most ferromagnetically - ordered not in the ground state but at this finite temperature even within the ferromagnetic phase .",
