    "a _ strictly linearly ordered semigroup _ is a tuple @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a non - empty set , @xmath2 is a linear order on @xmath1 and @xmath3 is an associative map such that @xmath4 implies @xmath5 and @xmath6 for all @xmath7 ( by @xmath4 we mean that @xmath8 , but @xmath9 ) .",
    "there is a long tradition of investigating the question whether a strictly linearly ordered semigroup can be embedded into the additive semigroup of all real numbers .",
    "a first result of this type was obtained by abel in case that the semigroup operation fulfils some differentiability conditions ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a modern review of abel s article )",
    ". in @xcite aczl gave the following generalization of abel s result :    [ theo_aczel ] let @xmath10 be a real interval endowed with the usual order @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath11 be an associative operation on @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is a strictly linearly ordered semigroup .",
    "if the semigroup operation @xmath11 is jointly continuous , then there is an interval @xmath14 and a monotone , bijective and continuous mapping @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",
    "an _ isomorphism _ of two strictly linearly ordered semigroups @xmath0 and @xmath18 is a function @xmath19 which is monotone , bijective and which fulfils the equation @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "note that if @xmath19 is an isomorphism , then so is the inverse mapping @xmath22 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 and @xmath18 are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism between them .",
    "in this terminology aczl s theorem states that if @xmath12 is a real interval and @xmath13 is a strictly linearly ordered semigroup with jointly continuous operation @xmath11 , then @xmath13 is isomorphic to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a real interval , too ( note that in this case the continuity of @xmath25 , which is asserted in aczl s theorem , follows automatically since every monotone bijection between two real intervals is continuous ) .",
    "there are several generalizations of aczl s theorem weakening the monotonicity condition on the binary operation ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) or extending the result to @xmath26-ary operations ( see the recent article @xcite ) . in @xcite a new , streamlined proof of aczl s theorem was given by craigen and pals and in @xcite aczl gives a review of his own proof and some notes on craigen and pals version of the proof .",
    "the problem of embedding a linearly ordered semigroup into the real numbers under topological conditions was also treated in two recent articles by ghiselli ricci ( @xcite and @xcite )    there are also other approaches to the subject , that use algebraical instead of topological conditions on the semigroup ( see @xcite , chapter xi for an overview over some results of this type ) .    for a detailed discussion of the history of the subject see the survey article of hofmann and lawson in @xcite . for the connection of the subject to hilbert s fifth problem , see also @xcite and @xcite .    in this article",
    "we present a further approach to the subject discussed above , that is based on the notion of square roots : an element @xmath27 of a strictly linearly ordered semigroup is said to _ admit a square root _ if there is an element @xmath28 such that @xmath29 . in this case",
    "@xmath28 is uniquely determined .",
    "it is called the _ square root _ of @xmath27 and denoted by @xmath30 . given a strictly linearly ordered semigroup on a real interval and assuming that each element of the semigroup admits a square root",
    ", we will prove that the semigroup operation is jointly continuous , so that we can apply aczl s theorem in order to embed our semigroup into the real numbers .",
    "note , that square roots ( and hence , dyadic numbers ) play a role in several constructions and proofs within the theory of ordered algebraic objects .",
    "see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and section xi.8 in @xcite for the usage of roots and dyadic numbers in some approaches to abstract mean values .",
    "moreover , roots are involved in many of the above mentioned embedding results in order to construct some kind of exponential - functions which serve as a semigroup - homomorphisms .    however , while those approaches impose different topological or algebraical conditions on the semigroup and then use roots mainly for the construction of homomorphisms , we take the existence of square roots as a starting point and then derive continuity of the semigroup operation .    throughout , let @xmath12 be a real interval , @xmath2 the restriction of the usual order on @xmath31 to @xmath12 and @xmath11 a binary operation on @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is a strictly linearly ordered semigroup .",
    "our aim is to prove the following result :    [ theo_main_result ] suppose that every element of @xmath12 admits a square root .",
    "then the operation @xmath32 is jointly continuous .",
    "therefore , by aczl s theorem , we obtain the following corollary :    [ cor_isomorphism_to_the_real_line ] suppose that every element of @xmath12 admits a square root .",
    "then @xmath13 is isomorphic to the strictly linearly ordered semigroup @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is one of the real intervals @xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 or @xmath35 $ ] .    by aczl s theorem and theorem [ theo_main_result ]",

    "since the map @xmath41 is an isomorphism between @xmath42,\\le,+)$ ] and @xmath43 respectively between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the corollary is proved .",
    "to prove theorem [ theo_main_result ] , we first recall some notions about strictly linearly ordered semigroups .",

    "unit_. there is at most one unit in @xmath12 ( for if @xmath53 and @xmath54 are units , then @xmath55 ) .",
    "moreover , due to the following proposition , every element @xmath46 that is not a unit , is either strictly positive or strictly negative .",

    "similarly , from @xmath63 we obtain @xmath49 .",
    "this shows ( i ) .    in order to show ( ii ) and ( iii ) , just imitate the prove of ( i ) , while replacing the @xmath64-relation by @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",

    "if @xmath46 is strictly positive , then @xmath67 .",
    "on the other hand , if we assume @xmath60 than @xmath68 and @xmath69 for each @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath53 is strictly positive , which proves ( iv ) .",
    "similarly , one proves ( v ) .    as a corollary",
    "we obtain :    [ cor_positive_elements_and_powers ] let @xmath46 .",

    "if @xmath53 is strictly positive , then @xmath72 by the definition of strict positivity .",
    "by proposition [ prop_positive_elements ] ( i ) it follows that @xmath71 is strictly positive .",
    "similarly we can see that if @xmath53 is strictly negative respectively a unit , then so is @xmath71 .",
    "this in turn implies that if @xmath71 is strictly positive , then @xmath53 can neither be strictly negative nor a unit , i.e. @xmath53 is strictly positive .    in the same way",

    "we define a map @xmath91    note that @xmath92 is well - defined , for if @xmath93 , then the set @xmath94 is bounded below by @xmath95 for a sufficiently small @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the infimum in the above definition exists and is contained in @xmath12 .",
    "[ prop_real_exponential ] let @xmath47 be strictly positive .",
    "then the map @xmath97 is strictly increasing , and for each @xmath82 the equation @xmath98 holds .",
    "let @xmath82 .",
    "by proposition [ prop_monotone_dyadic_powers ] we have @xmath99 , which implies @xmath98 .",
    "now , let @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "there are @xmath81 such that @xmath102 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath103 in which the latter two inequalities follow from proposition [ prop_monotone_dyadic_powers ] .",
    "according to the above proposition , we can think of @xmath104 as an extension of the map @xmath84 to the strictly positive real line .",
    "however , since we have not yet proved continuity of @xmath11 , it is not clear at all , whether the homomorphism properties of the dyadic powers @xmath78 are fulfilled by the real powers @xmath92 , too .",
    "nevertheless the exponential map @xmath104 is quite useful in the proof of the following lemma , which is the essential step on our way to prove theorem [ theo_main_result ] :    [ lem_approx_unit ] let @xmath47 be strictly positive .",
    "then for each @xmath46 , we have @xmath105 .    by proposition [ prop_monotone_dyadic_powers ]",
    "the sequence @xmath106 is decreasing and bounded below by @xmath53 , so we have @xmath107 .",
    "assume towards a contradiction that @xmath108 .",

    "this implies that our assumption is false and therefore @xmath117 .    in the setting of a real interval , separability arguments are often useful to prove continuity results ( see , for example , @xcite , section ii.5.3 , where a similar argument is used to deduce , under certain conditions , the joint continuity of a semigroup operation from the continuity of all left translations @xmath118 ) .    from lemma [ lem_approx_unit ]",
    "we obtain the following corollary :    [ cor_continuous_1 ] for the left translations @xmath119 , @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , the following assertions hold :    * if there is at least one strictly positive element in @xmath12 , then all left translations @xmath122 are continuous from above on @xmath12 .",

    "hence , @xmath122 is continuous from below at @xmath124 .    in order to further strengthen the continuity result of corollary [ cor_continuous_1 ] we make use of the following observations :    [ rem_associated_semigroups ] from @xmath13 we construct two related strictly linearly ordered semigroups :    * consider the binary operation @xmath143 that is defined by @xmath144 .",
