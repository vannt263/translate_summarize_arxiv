    "classification is an important first step in the characterization of any astronomical population .",
    "it enables one to study the global properties of a group of similar objects and generalize to larger , and perhaps undetected , members .",
    "a fundamental attribute of astronomical classification is that it is based on observations ; i.e. , the way objects appear morphologically , photometrically , or spectroscopically . stellar spectral classification has been in practice for nearly 150 years , and calibration of spectral classes to temperature and luminosity scales has provided crucial insight into the internal physics of stars , their history and evolution , and the properties of the galaxy and extragalactic systems .",
    "the stellar sequence of @xcite , the most widely accepted classification scheme , originates from the temperature - based sequence first used in the henry draper catalog @xcite , and luminosity discriminants initially identified by @xcite .",
    "it extends the main sequence from hot o - type stars to cool m dwarfs , the latter of which until recently were the coolest and faintest stars known . with the advent of more sensitive optical and near - infrared detectors and large - scale surveys , including the two micron",
    "all sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss ) , and the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter denis ) , cooler stars and brown dwarfs have now been identified . as a result ,",
    "two new spectral classes have been introduced , the l @xcite and t @xcite classes , which are extensions of the main stellar sequence into the brown dwarf regime .",
    "the l spectral class is comprised of a mix of stars and brown dwarfs , characterized in the red optical ( 630010100  ) by weakening bands of tio and vo ( dominant features in m dwarfs ) ; strengthening bands of feh , crh , and h@xmath2o ; and strengthening lines of the alkali metals na i , k i , cs i , and rb i @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared spectra of these objects are similar to those of m dwarfs , dominated by h@xmath2o and co bands , but are redder ( 1.3 @xmath8 j - k@xmath5 @xmath8 2.1 ) , a characteristic attributed to warm photospheric dust @xcite .",
    "l dwarfs cover an effective temperature ( t@xmath3 ) range from 20002200 k down to @xmath4 13001700 k @xcite , corresponding to luminosities l @xmath4 4@xmath910@xmath10 to 3@xmath910@xmath11 l@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "well over one hundred of these objects have now been identified in the field @xcite , in stellar clusters @xcite , and as companions to nearby stars @xcite .",
    "classification schemes for l dwarfs in the red optical have been defined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the t spectral class is comprised of brown dwarfs that exhibit ch@xmath1 absorption bands between 1.0 and 2.2 @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of these bands , broad h@xmath2o features , and collision - induced ( cia ) h@xmath2 absorption radically alter the spectral energy distributions of t dwarfs , and near - infrared colors become increasingly blue ( j - k@xmath5 @xmath4 0 ) as compared to l dwarfs .",
    "these distinctions led @xcite to propose a second class , which at that time was solely occupied by the first unequivocal brown dwarf , gliese 229b @xcite . recently , a number of objects similar to gliese 229b have been discovered by sdss @xcite , 2mass @xcite , and the new technology telescope deep field @xcite .",
    "these objects exhibit the same ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o bands seen in gliese 229b , but of differing strengths , suggesting that near - infrared spectra can be used to derive a t dwarf classification scheme @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we make a first attempt to define such a scheme based on the strengths of near - infrared ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o absorption bands and colors , using spectral data obtained for newly discovered and previously known t dwarfs . in @xmath132 , we summarize our search for t dwarfs using the 2mass database . in @xmath133 , we discuss near - infrared spectroscopy acquired for candidate and known t dwarfs , and describe features observed in these data .",
    "eleven new t dwarfs identified in the 2mass search are presented in @xmath134 , and a rough determination of the t dwarf space density from this search are compared to estimates from other samples . in @xmath135 , we use the near - infrared spectral data , along with data obtained from the literature , to establish a near - infrared classification scheme for t dwarfs .",
    "we also introduce a suite of spectral indices useful for subtyping .",
    "the properties of these t subclasses are discussed in @xmath136 , in which we speculate on the effective temperature scale of these objects based on their atmospheric evolution .",
    "the convergence of the l and t classes is addressed in @xmath137 , based in part on the increasing importance of ch@xmath1 absorption in shaping the spectra of late - type l dwarfs , including the possible presence of weak ch@xmath1 features in the k - band spectrum of the l7 v double denis 0205 - 1159ab @xcite . in @xmath138 , we analyze our only peculiar t dwarf , 2mass 0937 + 2931 , whose k - band flux is highly suppressed , possibly due to increased surface gravity or diminished metallicity .",
    "we summarize our results in @xmath139 .",
    "since late 1998 , we have been searching for t dwarfs using 2mass point source data .",
    "this all - sky survey employs two automated 1.3 m telescopes , at mt .",
    "hopkins ( usa ) and cerro tololo ( chile ) , each equipped with a three - channel camera capable of simultaneous observations in the j ( 1.25 @xmath0 ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath0 ) , and k@xmath5 ( 2.17 @xmath0 ) near - infrared bands , down to nominal survey completeness limits of 15.8 , 15.1 , and 14.3 , respectively . survey operations , begun in 1997 june at mt .  hopkins and 1998 march at cerro tololo ,",

    "additional information about 2mass can be found in cutri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "molecular absorption and cool effective temperatures cause the spectral energy distributions of t dwarfs to peak at j - band ( 1.25 @xmath0 ) , and near - infrared surveys such as 2mass are particularly tuned to detecting these objects .",
    "unfortunately , the near - infrared colors of t dwarfs ( j - k@xmath5 @xmath4 0 ) make them difficult to distinguish from the overwhelming background of main sequence stars",
    ". figure 1 illustrates this problem in a near - infrared color - color diagram .",

    "their distribution is well traced by the giant and dwarf stellar tracks ( solid lines ) of @xcite . extending from the red branch of the dwarf track , comprised of late m dwarfs @xcite ,",

    "* square ) and the majority of t dwarfs ( circles ) identified by 2mass and sdss .",
    "these objects lie just below the densest region of near - infrared color space , occupied by early - type ( o - g ) stars .",
    "`` early '' t dwarfs ( also known as l / t transition objects ; leggett et al .",
    "2000 ) lie at colors intermediate between the l dwarfs and gliese 229b ( j@xmath6k@xmath5 @xmath4 11.5 ) along the giant track .",
    "objects with even bluer near - infrared colors ( j@xmath6k@xmath5 @xmath4 0.51 ) are likely to be indistinguishable from the vast majority of background sources .    nonetheless , it is possible to distinguish t dwarfs using optical / near - infrared colors .",
    "low effective temperatures , broadened k i absorption @xcite , and the possible presence of dust opacity @xcite , make t dwarfs extremely red in the optical , with r@xmath6j @xmath18 9 @xcite . thus , t dwarfs similar to gliese 229b with j @xmath18 1012 would have been easily missed in earlier optical sky surveys ( e.g. , poss - ii ; reid et al .",
    "1991 ) , which have typical limiting magnitudes of r @xmath8 1921 .    with these photometric properties in mind ,",
    "we have constrained our search to the identification of the coolest t dwarfs which have sufficient h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 absorption to push their near - infrared colors blueward of the majority of background stars ( j@xmath6k@xmath5 @xmath8 0.6 ) .",
    "we impose an additional optical / near - infrared color cut by rejecting candidate objects with optical counterparts ( from the usno - a2.0 catalog ; monet et al .",
    "1998 ) within 5@xmath19 of their 2mass coordinates .",
    "we note that objects in the usno - a2.0 catalog are required to be detected on both the r- and b - band plates , so that faint red objects visible only on the r - band plates ( such as background m stars ) generally remain on our candidate lists .",
    "we have drawn three samples from the 2mass point source catalogues in order to identify t dwarf candidates .",
    "the properties of these samples are summarized in table 1 .",
    "initial candidates were required to have @xmath16 @xmath20 15@xmath15 in order to reduce source confusion near the galactic plane , and high source density regions around the magellenic clouds and 47 tuc were excluded .",
    "our main search sample , wdb0699 , was drawn from the 2mass working database in 1999 june , at a time when 2mass sky coverage was approximately 45% complete .",

    "deg .  of 2mass data .",
    "grey boxes highlight areas surveyed by 2mass at the time of candidate selection ; data from 23510 scans were used in this sample , 12556 from the northern hemisphere and 10954 from the southern hemisphere . note the increased source density close to the galactic plane ( dashed line ) , due to a higher concentration of ( typically ) faint background stars .",
    "initial candidates were further required to have j- and h - band detections with j @xmath17 16 , j - h @xmath17 0.3 , and h - k@xmath5 @xmath17 0.3 ( dashed lines in figure 1 ) .",
    "five t dwarfs have already been published from this sample @xcite0.09 ) . ] .",
    "the other search samples were drawn from the 2mass second incremental data release ( 2mass idr2 ) , and were used to investigate biases inherent to the color criteria of the primary wdb0699 sample .",
    "the rdb0400 sample reverses the h - k@xmath5 color cut in order to identify faint sources without k@xmath5 detections , and thus artificially red h - k@xmath5 colors .",

    "this sample was used to identify t dwarfs with weaker ch@xmath1 absorption , and was limited to the sky observable from the southern hemisphere during the months of june and july . note that despite the stricter magnitude limit and smaller search area of this sample , a large number of initial candidates was identified , emphasizing the difficulties caused by the high background source density in this region of color space .    in order to refine our candidate selection , we improved upon our optical / near - infrared color cut by visually examining optical images of each candidate field .",
    "r - band imaging data 2@xmath225@xmath92@xmath225 around each candidate coordinate , taken by the poss - i , poss - ii , eso / serc , and aao ses @xcite surveys , were obtained from the canadian astronomy data centre s digitized sky survey image server",

    "note that our criterion of no detection on the optical plates eliminates many of the biases inherent to visual selection , including variable plate quality and masking by bright star halos ; these biases will tend to increase the number of false candidates in our candidate list , rather than eliminate bona fide t dwarfs .",

    "the 1.52 @xmath0 k i doublet and ca i lines , prominent in m dwarfs @xcite are only detectable in the m4.5 v lhs 511ab .",

    "the spectra in figures 4 and 6 show that h@xmath2o and ultimately ch@xmath1 absorption are the dominant features shaping the spectra of objects cooler than late m dwarfs .",
    "the h@xmath2o bands centered at 1.15 , 1.4 , and 1.9 @xmath0 segregate the spectral energy distributions into distinct z- , j- , h- , and k - band peaks as early as l6.5 v , while the addition of ch@xmath1 bands beginning at 1.05 , 1.3 , 1.6 , and 2.2 @xmath0 further confine the emitted flux into narrow peaks centered at 1.08 , 1.27 , 1.59 , and 2.07 @xmath0 . note that ch@xmath1 is necessary to produce the strong absorption at 1.15 @xmath0 , a feature also seen in the spectra of giant planets @xcite . in addition , the gradually developing slope between the 1.27 @xmath0 peak and the 1.4 @xmath0 h@xmath2o band is also caused by ch@xmath1 at 1.3 @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 absorptions , the k - band spectral region is shaped by 2.3 @xmath0 co in m and l dwarfs , a feature that has been detected in the early t dwarfs as well @xcite .",

    "none of the 2mass t dwarfs show any indications of co absorption .",
    "the other important molecular absorber at k - band is cia h@xmath2 , which has no distinct bandhead but likely suppresses flux throughout the 22.5 @xmath0 region starting in the latest l dwarfs ( see @xmath137 ) . with the presence of h@xmath2o , ch@xmath1 , co , and",
    "cia h@xmath2 absorption features , the k - band peak undergoes a dramatic evolution .",
    "starting from a flat slope with co bandheads in mid - m dwarfs , the k - band becomes a plateau girded by co and h@xmath2o absorptions in the l dwarfs ; it then develops from a double plateau with the dual presence of ch@xmath1 and co in the early sdss t dwarfs to an increasingly suppressed and rounded hump centered at 2.11 @xmath0 in the earliest 2mass t dwarfs ; finally , we see a smooth triangular peak centered at 2.07 @xmath0 in the latest t dwarfs ( those exhibiting the strongest ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o absorption ) .",
    "finer features of feh and k i have been identified in the j - band spectra of m and l dwarfs by @xcite , and these features are also indicated in figures 4 and 6 .",
    "the resolution of the nirc data is generally insufficient to resolve these lines , although the 1.25 @xmath0 k i doublet can be seen as a notch in the blue wing of the j - band peak of the t dwarf spectra .",

    "we believe that these features may be artifacts produced during our flux calibration due to imperfect interpolation over the brackett lines ( see @xmath133.3 ) , as they are not obviously present in the data prior to flux calibration . recalibrating the data using later - type standards may help to elucidate the authenticity and origin of these weak features ; however , their presence does not effect the analysis presented here .",

    "osiris data for 2mass 0559 - 1404 match the @xcite spectrum better at k ( right panel ) , but not as well at h - band .",
    "the spectra of the other objects agree quite well with published results , and small offsets may simply be due to differences in resolution or signal - to - noise . in general , we find that typical discrepancies do not exceed 1015% , quite adequate for the task of spectral classification .",

    "this is an important point , as models of cool brown dwarfs , although greatly improved over earlier work , do not yet adequately predict all of the features seen in t dwarf spectra @xcite .",

    "we examine how l dwarf near - infrared schemes may carry into the t dwarf regime in @xmath135.6 .",
    "the first step toward classification is to determine groupings , or subtypes .",
    "numerous techniques for identifying spectral subtypes in the mk system have been proposed @xcite .",
    "we have chosen to define t subclasses by the following procedure : first , we visually compared the spectra , normalized at their j - band peaks , with osiris and cgs4 data smoothed with a gaussian filter to match the resolution of the nirc data .",
    "these spectra were then sorted into a morphological order based on the strengths of the 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath0 ch@xmath1 bands , the 1.15 @xmath0 h@xmath2o / ch@xmath1 band , and the overall appearance of the j , h , and k - band peaks , similar to the ordering used in figures 4 and 6 .",
    "the ch@xmath1 absorption bands are expected to strengthen with decreasing t@xmath3 @xcite , so that a classification scheme based on these features should adequately represent an underlying temperature sequence .",
    "the spectra were then grouped into subtypes of similar morphology , with the number of subtypes chosen to evenly represent the spectral variations seen .",
    "this process was repeated until a consistent system developed , resulting in seven groups we have labeled t1 v , t2 v , t3 v , t5 v , t6 v , t7 v , and t8 v. our two subtype omissions , t0 v and t4 v , are based on apparent gaps in the photometric colors and spectral morphologies of the currently known t dwarf population . the earliest t dwarf so far identified , sdss 0837 - 0000 , is considerably bluer in j - k@xmath5 color that the latest l8 dwarfs , suggesting the presence of an additional ( earlier ) subtype with weaker methane features . we have also omitted a class between the latest of the sloan transition dwarfs , sdss 1021 - 0304 , and the reddest 2mass t dwarf , 2mass 2254 + 3123 , again based on the significant near - infrared color differences , as well substantial relative suppression of the h- and k - band peaks in the spectrum of the latter object .",
    "note that all of the 2mass discoveries fall exclusively in the last four subtypes , due to the color constraints discussed in @xmath132 .",
    "representative bright standards for each subtype were then chosen . low resolution spectra of these standards are shown in figure 11 , along with data for the l7 v denis 0205 - 1159ab @xcite .",
    "spectra are normalized at their j - band peaks with zero point offsets indicated by dashed lines .",
    "data from @xcite have been degraded to nirc resolution using a gaussian filter .",
    "the spectral properties of these subtypes are summarized in table 8 .",
    "the progressive strengthening of the h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 bands throughout the sequence is readily apparent .",
    "early types are distinguishable from l dwarfs by the presence of weak ch@xmath1 absorption at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath0 , the latter of which appears in conjunction with co at 2.3 @xmath0 in types t1 v , t2 v , and t3 v. other important features include the strengthening 1.15 @xmath0 h@xmath2o / ch@xmath1 band , weakening 1.25 @xmath0 k i doublets , suppression of h- and k - band flux relative to j ( significant between t3 v and t5 v ) , and narrowing of the 1.08 , 1.27 , 1.59 , and 2.07 @xmath0 peaks through t8 v. the k - band peak of the later subtypes evolves from a rounded hump centered at 2.11 @xmath0 ( t5 v ) , to a sloped , asymmetric peak notched at 2.17 @xmath0 ( t7 v ) , and finally into a sharper , symmetric peak centered at 2.07 @xmath0 ( t8 v ) .",
    "t dwarfs can be classified , to first order , by a simple visual comparison against the standard sequence plotted in figure 11 .",
    "a more quantitative approach is to use spectral indices , ratios of fluxes in spectral regions which measure specific morphological features , such as the ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o bands and the changing appearance of the k - band peak .",
    "based on the subtype properties listed in table 8 , we have defined a suite of spectral indices , listed in table 9 . for each index ,",
    "flux regions were chosen to sample the feature of interest and a nearby pseudo - continuum point ( typically the flux peaks at j , h , or k ) , and the mean of the data in these regions were ratioed .",
    "the h@xmath2o , ch@xmath1 , and co indices measure the relative depths of their respective bands , while the color indices h / j , k / j , and k / h are approximate measures of color around the 1.25 , 1.6 , and 2.1 @xmath0 flux peaks .",
    "both the 2.11/2.07 and k shape indices measure the change in the k - band peak , influenced by the molecular absorbers h@xmath2o , ch@xmath1 , co , and cia h@xmath2 .",
    "the behavior of these indices was examined for the t dwarf standards , and a subset of indices showing obvious trends were chosen for use in spectral typing .",
    "these include the h@xmath2o - a , h@xmath2o - b , ch@xmath1-a , ch@xmath1-b , and ch@xmath1-c band indices ; the h / j and k / j color indices ; and the 2.11/2.07 k - band ratio .",
    "values of these indices measured for late - l @xcite and t dwarf standards are listed in table 10 .",
    "nirc data were used to compute the standard ratios for types t5 v through t8 v , while cgs4 data were used for types l5 v through t3 v.    using the standard values as benchmarks , we then computed spectral types for the remaining t dwarfs by directly comparing the individual indices .",
    "tables 11a  c list the index values and corresponding subtypes derived from nirc and d78 , osiris , and literature data , respectively . only measurable indices are listed in each set ; for example , the spectral limits of the osiris and d78 data , and significant k - band noise , restrict the use of the h@xmath2o - a , ch@xmath1-c , and 2.11/2.07 indices .",
    "we note that the ch@xmath1-c , h / j , and k / j indices appear to saturate in the latest subtype standards , obviating their use in distinguishing between types t7 v and t8 v ; in addition , the 2.07/2.11 index shows a consistent trend only for types t3 v through t8 v.    individual subtypes were then averaged into a decimal classification after rejecting the single highest and lowest values ; these are listed in the last column of each table .",
    "uncertainties were determined from the scatter of the index subtypes , which in no case exceeded @xmath70.9 subclasses .",
    "finally , the decimal classifications were rounded off to the nearest 0.5 subclass to produce the final subtypes listed in table 7 ( col .  2 ) .",
    "in general , preference was given to classifications derived from nirc and cgs4 data , as these samples were used to derive the standard ratios .",
    "nonetheless , differences between the various datasets for common objects did not exceed @xmath70.9 subclasses .",
    "objects observed on multiple occasions by the same instrument showed no differences in the their final spectral types , indicating that the classifications are robust ( i.e. , not changed by intrinsic variability in the source ) . note that final subtypes for 2mass 0755 + 2212 and nttdf 1205 - 0744 are assigned tentative ( uncertain ) values due to the poor quality of their spectral data . ignoring these objects , comparison between the datasets",
    "indicates that the derived subtypes have typical uncertainties of @xmath70.5 subclasses .",
    "the behavior of our derived spectral indices as compared to spectral type allows us to ascertain the usefulness of these indices for classification , while also probing the evolution of spectral features .",
    "figures 12a  d plot these ratios for objects with types m4.5 v through t8 v , measured from the nirc ( diamonds ) , osiris ( triangles ) , and cgs4 ( squares ) datasets .",
    "filled circles indicate spectral standard values ; t spectral types are those listed in table 7 .",
    "note that we have ended the l sequence in this ( and subsequent ) diagrams at l8 v ; motivation for this choice is discussed in @xmath137 .",
    "the h@xmath2o indices ( figure 12a ) are seen to decrease monotonically over the entire sequence , except for the h@xmath2o - c index , which increases from t2 v to t8 v. decreasing indices imply strengthening bands , which can be easily seen in the spectral data shown in figures 4 and 6 .",
    "the slopes are greater in the t dwarfs , reflecting either increased band contrast with the loss of higher - energy ( and hence higher temperature ) wing transitions ; increased h@xmath2o photospheric abundance with the formation of ch@xmath1 , via : @xmath54 or increased transparency due to the settling of dust cloud layers @xcite .",
    "the sharper increase in slope for the h@xmath2o - a index is due to the additional contribution of ch@xmath1 absorption in this feature .",
    "note that the h@xmath2o - c index has a great deal of scatter in the t dwarf regime , and its behavior is likely affected by ch@xmath1 and cia h@xmath2 absorption at k - band .",
    "the ch@xmath1 indices ( figure 12b ) are generally flat for most of the m and l dwarfs earlier than type l5 v , but rapidly decrease starting around l5 v to t1 v. note that this behavior makes the ch@xmath1 indices particularly useful in distinguishing t dwarfs from other late - type objects , as expected .",
    "the ch@xmath1-a and ch@xmath1-b indices start to decrease around l8 v to t1 v , while ch@xmath1-c decreases as early as l3 v to l5 v. the latter downturn is likely due to absorption by cia h@xmath2 in the late - l and t dwarfs , although we can not rule out the early influence of ch@xmath1 as a minor absorber .",
    "the color indices ( figure 12c ) reflect the well - known reddening seen in near - infrared photometry of m and l dwarfs , but shows that there is a smooth transition to bluer colors in the t dwarf regime .",
    "all three of these indices peak around l5 v , at which point colors become steadily bluer , with late t dwarf values below those of mid - m dwarfs .",
    "it is interesting to note that both h / j and k / j turn over at the same spectral type , since cia h@xmath2 likely affects only the latter index .",
    "@xcite see a similar downturn in feh and crh bandstrengths in the red optical around l4 v to l5 v , and it is possible that these trends are in some way correlated , possibly through the precipitation of photospheric dust ( see @xmath136.3.2 ) . both the h / j and k / j indices appear to saturate and possibly reverse their downward trends between types t7 v and t8 v. the k / h index shows more scatter and is less useful than the other color indices .",
    "the remaining indices ( figure 12d ) are generally not useful for spectral classification over the full range of spectral types shown .",
    "the co index shows a gradual decline from mid - m to early - t ( implying increasing band strength ) , but is predominantly scatter for most of the t dwarfs due to 2.2 @xmath0 ch@xmath1 absorption .",
    "the 2.11/2.07 index is generally constant from mid - m to early - t , but shows a downturn beyond t3 v. despite the significant scatter , this index appears to separate mid- and late - t dwarfs from warmer objects , probably reflecting changes in the relative strengths of absorbers at k - band beyond t5 v. finally , the k - shape index appears to show no real trends over the entire range of subtypes .",

    "these scales clearly bracket the effective temperatures calculated here and from @xcite for most of the l dwarfs , although the kirkpatrick scale generally underestimates temperatures for the early l dwarfs , while the basri scale overestimates temperatures for the late l dwarfs .",
    "additional discussion on the l dwarf temperature scale is given in @xcite .",
    "currently , only two t dwarfs have known distances and hence absolute brightness determinations : gliese 229b and gliese 570d . because they are companions to well - studied bright stars , accurate estimates of effective temperature for these objects",
    "have been derived using evolutionary models and the properties of their primaries @xcite ; these temperatures are plotted as solid circles in figure 17 .",
    "it is clear that an extrapolation of equation 13 into the t dwarf regime substantially underestimates the temperatures of these objects . indeed , as pointed out by @xcite , there appears to be a relatively small difference in t@xmath3 between the coolest l dwarfs and gliese 229b , only @xmath4 350 k. how do we resolve this situation with the observed changes in spectromorphology and photometric colors , including the apparently continuous strengthening of h@xmath2o indices across the l / t boundary ?",
    "the solution to this problem may lie in the behavior of atmospheric dust .",
    "recent models by @xcite indicate that dust clouds , which significantly modify the emergent spectra of l dwarfs , reside at the 15001800 k temperature layer in brown dwarfs , and thus begin to settle below the photosphere around the l / t transition .",
    "@xcite find a similar critical temperature at t@xmath77 = 1550 k. loss of dust opacity likely causes substantial redistribution of emergent flux , increasing transparency in some spectral regions , while also increasing h@xmath2o and ( ultimately ) ch@xmath1 band strengths as the photosphere cools .",
    "in addition , the cooling of the atmosphere above the dust layers will drive the formation of ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o , increasing their column abundances and hence further increasing band strengths .",
    "these events should result in a significant strengthening of molecular bands over a narrow t@xmath3 range .",
    "the dust loss scenario also explains the strengthening of the 1.25 @xmath0 k i doublet from l8 v to t5 v , inducing greater transparency at j - band and a corresponding increase in column abundance .",
    "another intriguing scenario suggested by @xcite is the formation of holes in the dust clouds , or `` hot spots '' , similar to what is seen on jupiter at 5 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "small bright regions could potentially dominate over discrete spectral bands , modifying the emergent flux with little change to the total luminosity or effective temperature .",
    "based on these considerations , we speculate that the evolution of brown dwarfs from spectral types l8 v to t5 v occurs over a narrow range in t@xmath3 , perhaps as little as 200 k ( dot - dashed line ) . this temperature difference is similar to that between gliese 229b ( t6.5 v ) and gliese 570d ( t8 v ) . because dust resides in a relatively narrow range of thermal layers , its effect on the emergent spectrum below t@xmath3 @xmath4 1000 k will no longer be important . indeed ,",
    "dust - free models by @xcite provided better fits to the spectrum of gliese 229b than corresponding dusty models . the evolution of spectral features at this point should once again be tied to effective temperature , with spectral types later than roughly t6 v sampling a broader range of t@xmath3 .",
    "parallax observations of t dwarfs are necessary to test this hypothesis , and variability observations of the latest l dwarfs and earliest t dwarfs could also provide clues to the behavior of atmospheric dust as it settles below the photosphere .",
    "note that a narrow t@xmath3 range for objects of type l8 v through t5 v would imply a paucity of these brown dwarfs relative to later - type t dwarfs ; more accurate space densities are needed to test this prediction .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that the rapid depletion of dust provides a natural explanation to the observed evolution of spectral features and estimated effective temperatures .",
    "the behavior of spectral indices and colors between the latest l dwarfs and early t dwarfs shows a small morphological gap between l8 v and t1 v. the recent detection of the fundamental band of ch@xmath1 at 3.3 @xmath0 in objects as early as l5 v @xcite and the lack of objects later than l8 v in 2mass l dwarf searches @xcite both suggest that the separation in temperature between these two classes is also not large . to investigate the l / t transition , we examined the near - infrared spectrum of the l7 v denis 0205 - 1159ab , a bright , well - studied , equal - magnitude binary @xcite , 17.5 pc from the sun @xcite .",

    "in addition , there is a weak absorption feature at 2.20 @xmath0 ( arrows ) present in all of the denis 0205 - 1159ab spectra except that of @xcite that closely corresponds to a sharp feature in the ch@xmath1 opacity spectrum .",

    "the high - energy na i lines form 3.2 ev above the ground state and appear to weaken over types late - m to mid - l @xcite .",
    "it is likely , therefore , that na i is not responsible for this feature in denis 0205 - 1159ab .",
    "does the weak 2.20 @xmath0 feature constitute a clear detection of ch@xmath1 at k - band in the latest l dwarfs ? in our opinion it does not , due to the weakness and occasional non - detection of the absorption .",
    "its apparent variability in the spectra of figure 18 may be intrinsic to the source , as a number of l- and t - type brown dwarfs have recently been shown to be variable , both photometrically @xcite and spectroscopically @xcite , likely due to patchy clouds of dust in the photosphere @xcite .",
    "differences in instrumental resolution and observing conditions , however , make this interpretation ambiguous , and the weakness of this feature may lend doubt to its reality . higher resolution ,",
    "higher signal - to - noise , and time - resolved data are required to confirm its authenticity and possible variable nature .",
    "nonetheless , the opacity spectra in figure 18 do suggest that ch@xmath1 is an important minor absorber at these temperatures , and its emergence as an identifiable feature likely occurs in objects only slightly cooler than denis 0205 - 1159ab .",
    "this suggests that the earliest t dwarfs ( i.e. , those with clear ch@xmath1 bands ) are probably not significantly cooler than the latest l dwarfs currently known . in that case , l8 v may be the last subtype of the l spectral class , with cooler objects showing obvious ch@xmath1 absorption features at k - band , classifying them as t dwarfs . in order to verify this hypothesis , it is necessary to identify more of the so - called `` l / t transition '' objects and determine at what point the detection of ch@xmath1 becomes unambiguous at j- , h- , and k - bands .",
    "note that even if the 2.20 @xmath0 ch@xmath1 feature is confirmed in denis 0205 - 1159ab or in other l7/l8 dwarfs , it does not necessitate a reclassification of these objects , much as the 3.3 @xmath0 absorption seen in mid- and late - l dwarfs reclassify them as t dwarfs @xcite , or the presence of tio bands in bright k5 and k7 dwarfs @xcite reclassify them as m dwarfs .",

    "h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 are clearly more important at cooler temperatures , as cia h@xmath2 at 1 bar is only a minor absorber outside of the 2.1 @xmath0 window . however , because h@xmath2 features form via collisional processes , they strengthen with increasing pressure , scaling roughly as @xmath28 @xmath79 p. this effect can be seen in the increased opacity of cia h@xmath2 for p = 10 bar ( thick dashed line ) .",
    "the corresponding opacities of h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 are generally unaffected by changes in pressure ; and at or below t @xmath4 1000 k , number densities at equilibrium remain essentially unchanged @xcite .",

    "an alternate hypothesis for the strong k - band absorption in 2mass 0937 + 2931 is decreased metallicity .",
    "zero - metallicity brown dwarf spectral models are dominated by cia h@xmath2 opacity and peak shortward of 1 @xmath0 ; when molecular absorption is included , the suppression of flux at shorter wavelengths increases the relative luminosity at k - band by roughly a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "if the metallicity of a brown dwarf atmosphere were decreased from z = z@xmath12 to 0.1 z@xmath12 , the number densities of ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o and ( in an approximate sense ) their relative opacities would also decrease roughly by a factor of 10 .",
    "decreased metallicity would not significantly affect the amount of photospheric h@xmath2 present , although it may slightly alter the opacity spectrum .",
    "assuming photospheric pressure remained constant , one might expect the same relative opacity contributions in this scenario as in the z = z@xmath12 , p = 10 bar case .",
    "decreased metallicity would also explain the deficit of k i absorption seen at j - band . note that because of the reduced opacity and corresponding increased luminosity , brown dwarfs with subsolar metallicity cool more rapidly @xcite .",
    "thus , a metal - poor model for 2mass 0937 + 2931 is either younger ( same mass ) or more massive ( same age ) than its solar metallicity , t@xmath3 = 1000 k counterpart , while a high - pressure model must be both older and more massive .",
    "these arguments are based on very simple scaling laws of abundance and opacity , and disentangling the effects of t@xmath3 , specific gravity , and metallicity on the emergent spectrum of 2mass 0937 + 2931 requires more extensive modeling .",
    "it is clear , however , that cia h@xmath2 plays an important role in shaping the spectra of both l and t dwarfs , and its sensitivity to the ambient pressure makes it an excellent tracer of surface gravity and hence mass .",
    "diagnostics that measure the relative contributions of cia h@xmath2 , ch@xmath1 , and h@xmath2o may allow us to extract the physical characteristics of these constantly evolving objects .",

    "six years later , at least two dozen counterparts have been identified , the majority found only in the past two years by the 2mass and sdss surveys .",

    "we have made a first attempt to define a classification scheme for t dwarfs which segregates the currently known population into subtypes t1 v , t2 v , t3 v , t5 v , t6 v , t7 v , and t8 v. we have also introduced a prescription for near - infrared classification using a suite of spectral indices that measure the strengths of ch@xmath1 and h@xmath2o bands , near - infrared colors , and the evolution of the k - band peak .",
    "our work parallels independent efforts reported by @xcite in this volume , who produce a nearly identical sequence based on cgs4 spectral data ( d.  golimowski , priv .  comm . ) . that this should be the case is not surprising , since both schemes are based on the observed strengths of h@xmath2o and ch@xmath1 features",

    "the possible role of ch@xmath1 as a minor contributor in shaping the k - band peak of the latest l dwarfs , and the recent detection of ch@xmath1 at 3.3 @xmath0 in objects as early as l5 v @xcite , lead us to believe that perhaps only one subclass exists between the latest l subtype ( l8 v ) and the earliest t subtype ( t1 v ) .",
    "thus , the gap between these two separately defined spectral classes appears to be effectively bridged .",

    "the condensation and gravitational settling of dust clouds leads to a substantial evolution of spectral morphology , possibly over a narrow t@xmath3 range . a rapid depletion of observed dust opacity , perhaps stimulated by the formation of holes in dust clouds extending to significantly hotter layers , could explain both the small effective temperature difference between the @xmath4 1300 k l8 v gliese 584c @xcite and the @xmath4 950 k t6.5 v gliese 229b @xcite , as well as the behavior of k i line strengths at j - band .",
    "one may argue that the spectral transition between the l and t classes is driven more by the physics of dust condensation than by the thermochemical formation of ch@xmath1 bands ( in addition , the latter process is likely driven by the former ) .",
    "modeling the l / t transition clearly requires a more accurate treatment of the condensation , coagulation , and settling of dust species @xcite .",

    "however , we believe that the one notable anomaly , 2mass 0937 + 2931 , which has a highly suppressed k - band peak likely caused by increased opacity from cia h@xmath2 , could be an extreme example of an old , high - mass brown dwarf or one with diminished metallicity . determining the properties of this unusual t dwarf will enable us to understand how the physical characteristics of mass , age , and composition separately shape the emergent energy distribution of cool brown dwarfs .",
    "it is clear that the identification of new t dwarfs in the 2mass and sdss surveys will help fill in the current gaps , both in the spectral sequence ( which must be developed to include such discoveries ) and in our understanding of processes occurring in cool brown dwarf atmospheres .",
