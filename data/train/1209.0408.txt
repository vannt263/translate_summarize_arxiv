    "as it is well known , the so - called chiral su@xmath2su@xmath3 symmetry of the classical action of qcd with @xmath4 massless quark flavors is spontaneously broken at the quantum level , with the order parameter for this symmetry breaking being the quark condensate @xmath5 .",
    "together with confinement , which is characterized by the gluon condensate @xmath6 , chiral - symmetry breaking is one of the two most important non - perturbative phenomena in qcd . a natural question can be posed as whether these phenomena are interrelated or not .",
    "an affirmative answer to this question would imply proportionality between the quark and the gluon condensates , which was indeed found in ref .",
    "the corresponding relation reads [ kj ]    length , at which the two - point gauge - invariant correlation function of gluonic field strengths exponentially falls off .",
    "equation  ( [ kj ] ) stems from the integration in the qcd partition function over soft gluonic fields in the leading , gaussian , approximation . within this approximation ,",
    "the kernel of the four - quark interaction is defined by the two - point field - strength correlation function with the amplitude @xmath6 and the correlation length @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , if one first integrates in the qcd partition function over the quark fields , one arrives at a gauge - invariant effective action , where the gluonic degrees of freedom are represented in the form of wilson loops and their correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "an advantageous feature of this approach is that , owing to the color - neutrality of wilson loops , the calculation of the effective action becomes reduced to the calculation of the world - line integrals in an _",
    "abelian _ gauge theory .",
    "when the dynamical quarks which are integrated out are sufficiently heavy , namely their current mass @xmath8 is larger than @xmath9 , the gluonic field inside the quark trajectory can be treated as nearly constant . in this heavy - quark limit ,",
    "the one - loop effective action yields the following heavy - quark condensate of a given flavor  @xcite : [ hee ] |_svz=- .",
    "this expression coincides with the one known from the svz sum rules  @xcite .    with @xmath8 decreasing downwards @xmath9 , variations of the gauge field inside the quark trajectory produce corrections to eq .",

    "@xcite , which , for the case of a fermion moving in an _ arbitrary _ abelian gauge field , yields a closed formula for the effective action with two field strengths .",
    "furthermore , it is known that , in addition to the confining interactions of stochastic gluonic fields , there also exist non - confining non - perturbative interactions of those fields , albeit of a relatively small strength ( cf . ref .",
    "below , we study the influence of such interactions on the heavy - quark condensate . for the case of the simplest , purely exponential , two - point correlation function of gluonic field strengths , we find the interesting phenomenon of a complete independence of the heavy - quark condensate from the non - confining non - perturbative interactions .",

    "the corresponding two - point surface - surface and contour - contour self - interactions of the wilson loop can be represented as being mediated by an auxiliary abelian gauge field with the gaussian action . in particular , for the most simple , exponential , parametrization of the two - point correlation function of gluonic field strengths , we have found an interesting phenomenon of a complete independence of the heavy - quark condensate from the non - confining non - perturbative interactions of the stochastic gluonic fields .    in conclusion , we have started our analysis from the heavy - quark limit , where chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by a large current quark mass .",
    "the advantage of working in this limit is that one avoids possible uncertainties related to the particular form of the field - strength correlation function .",

    "fig .  1 ) , which is the case of @xmath70- , @xmath133- , and @xmath82-quarks .",
    "the reason is that , for such light quarks , the effect of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry starts to play an important role , resulting in the appearance of a significant self - energy contribution to the dynamical constituent quark mass .",
    "thus , since such a self - energy contribution can not be consistently calculated within the adopted world - line formalism , we have to restrict our analysis to the case of heavy quarks , for which this contribution can be safely disregarded compared to the current quark mass .",
