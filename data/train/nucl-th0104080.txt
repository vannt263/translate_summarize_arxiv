    "hypernuclei are bound systems of non - strange and strange baryons . in present facilities ,",
    "hypernuclei are created with hadronic reactions as ( @xmath4,k ) at brookhaven and kek or electroproduction ones as ( e , ek ) at tjnaf. the decay of those objects proceeds via the weak interaction which is 10 orders of magnitude slower than the strong one and violates parity , isospin and strangeness . for the very light hypernuclei",
    "the mesonic decay mode ( @xmath5 ) is dominant , but as @xmath6 increases so does the pauli blocking acting on the outgoing nucleon , and hypernuclei mainly decay via the one - nucleon induced non - mesonic mode , @xmath7 . since the pioneering phenomenological model of block and dalitz @xcite",
    ", many approaches have been developed to understand the dynamics of the decay , and the results have been collected in extensive review articles @xcite .",
    "many works are based on a meson exchange picture , either using a simple one - pion - exchange mechanism @xcite , or including also heavier meson exchanges , such as the @xmath8 @xcite or the complete pseudoscalar and vector meson octets @xcite .",
    "the effect of correlated - two pion exchange mechanism @xcite as well as the role of @xmath9 transitions , implemented in a meson - exchange picture @xcite , have also been investigated . a four quark weak transition",
    "effective hamiltonian , corrected by qcd , which contains both @xmath10 and @xmath11 transitions , has also been applied in the study of the weak decay of hypernuclei @xcite . in general , the weak decay rates are reasonably reproduced by the models but the ratio of neutron induced ( @xmath12 ) to proton induced ( @xmath13 ) decays , @xmath2 , turns out to be smaller than the experimental value , which is of the order of 1 or larger @xcite , although new recent theoretical progress has been achieved into the solution of this puzzle @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath7 , the decay can also proceed via the two - nucleon induced process , @xmath14 , originally studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which amounts to about 15% of the total width @xcite and can not be neglected in the experimental analysis trying to extract the ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the high momentum of about 400 mev / c transferred in the @xmath7 reaction makes this process quite sensitive to short range physics . as a consequence , the strong baryon - baryon interaction both in the initial and final states plays a quite important role .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to revisit the one - meson - exchange model of ref .",
    "@xcite , with an especial interest in quantifying the effect of final state interactions , as well as the uncertainties of different model ingredients . in doing so",
    ", we will also point out a sign error encountered in certain transitions mediated by the exchange of strange mesons which , when corrected , gives rise to a considerably increase in the @xmath2 ratio .",
    "we will analyze the sensitivity of our results to the way final state interactions of the emitted nucleons are implemented , using different prescriptions to obtain the @xmath15 scattered wave function .",
    "our study concludes that , with the appropriate treatment of final state interactions and with the correct sign for the contribution of the strange mesons , the one - meson - exchange model is able to describe very satisfactorily most of the measured observables , including the elusive ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the weak transition potential is obtained by following the model of ref . @xcite . in analogy to one - boson - exchange ( obe ) based models of the strong interaction ,",
    "the present formalism includes not only the exchange of the long - ranged pion , but also more massive mesons which account for shorter distances .",
    "this potential has been presented in previous papers and , therefore , it is not going to be discussed here in a great detail . however , we would like to show its expression in coordinate space , which represents a compact way of including all the mesons and transition channels in the mechanism .",
    "the @xmath16-space potential then reads :    @xmath17    where the index @xmath18 runs over the different mesons exchanged ( @xmath19 represents @xmath20,k,@xmath21,k@xmath22 ) and @xmath23 over the different spin operators : central spin independent ( c ) , central spin dependent ( ss ) , tensor ( t ) and parity violating ( pv ) .",
    "the angular dependence is represented by the @xmath24 operator , explicitly given by :    @xmath25 { \\hat r } & \\mbox{pv ( for vector mesons ) }   \\ , { \\rm , } \\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] while the isospin operator , @xmath26 , takes the form @xmath27 for isovector mesons ( @xmath4,@xmath8 ) , @xmath28 for isoscalar mesons ( @xmath29,@xmath30 ) and a combination of both operators for the isodoublet ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) .",
    "the different pieces of the potential , @xmath31 , are found by fourier transforming the potential in momentum space . in particular , for pseudoscalar mesons the @xmath32-space potential reads :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the fermi weak constant times the pion mass squared , @xmath35 the coupling at the strong baryon - baryon - meson ( @xmath36 ) vertex , @xmath37 and @xmath38 the parity violating ( pv ) and parity conserving ( pc ) weak couplings respectively , @xmath39 the meson mass , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) the average of the baryon masses at the strong ( weak ) vertex .",
    "we want to note here that the convention has always been to direct the momentum towards the strong vertex and , in connection to this , care must be taken when this expression is applied to @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) exchange , since in this case vertex 1 refers to @xmath42 and vertex 2 to @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the combination of the strange meson transition amplitudes with the other non - strange meson contributions requires to exchange , in the former ones , the space , spin and isospin quantum numbers between the @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the initial state and between the two emitted nucleons in the final state . for a particular transition from an initial @xmath46 channel to a final @xmath47 one , this exchange operation introduces the additional factor :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the nucleon isospin and @xmath50 the isospin assigned to the @xmath44 isospurion , which can take the values @xmath51 or @xmath52 depending on whether one is considering a change in isospin of 1/2 or 3/2 . the way to implement @xmath9 transitions in the present mechanism can be found in ref .",
    "the factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fac1 ] ) is nothing but a sign in front of the pc and/or pv amplitudes , which is :    @xmath53    it is common to write the total decay as the sum of definite spin - isospin amplitudes .",
    "for example , for s - shell hypernuclei one has@xcite :    @xmath54    if we adopt the @xmath55 rule  which we always do for pseudoscalar meson exchange @xcite , the kaon and pion potentials differ in a minus sign only in the @xmath56 amplitude in ( [ transitions ] ) , the only pv amplitude with @xmath57 .",
    "in order to account for finite size effects we include a monopole form factor at each vertex , @xmath58 , where the value of the cut - off , @xmath59 , depends on the meson ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the updated expression for the regularized potential was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in previous calculations we used the cut - offs given by the jlich b interaction @xcite .",
    "the reason was that unlike the early @xmath61 nijmegen model@xcite , which used different cut - offs depending on the irreducible representation of the baryon - baryon channel , the jlich b was the only obe model which used different cut - offs depending on the meson .",
    "however , the nijmegen group has recently made available new baryon - baryon interactions in the strangeness @xmath62 and @xmath63 sectors @xcite .",
    "these potentials are based on su(3 ) extensions of the models in the @xmath64 and @xmath65 sectors , which are fitted to the experimental data .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite give six different models , which fit the available @xmath15 and @xmath61 scattering data equally well but are characterized by different values of the magnetic vector @xmath66 ratio , ranging from 0.4447 ( model nsc97a ) to 0.3647 ( model nsc97f ) .",
    "the advantage of these new models is that the form factors depend on the su(3 ) type of meson .",
    "the momentum space potential for each meson is multiplied by the regularizing factor of gaussian type , @xmath67 , with a cut - off @xmath68 for the singlet meson , @xmath69 for the non - strange members of the meson octet and @xmath70 for the strange meson . in order to accommodate to our own formalism , which uses a monopole form factor at each vertex",
    ", we will match the gaussian to a function of the type @xmath71 ^ 2 $ ] at @xmath72 mev / c , the most relevant momentum transfer in the @xmath7 process .",
    "since , by definition , both functional forms give 1 at @xmath73 , our alternative expression with the modified cut - offs @xmath74 , listed in table [ tab : formfac ] , gives an excellent reproduction of the gaussian nsc97 form factors up to a momentum transfer of about 600 mev / c .    as it is well known",
    ", one of the sources of uncertainty in obe models comes from the coupling constants between baryons and mesons . in the strong sector",
    "the different interaction models use su(3 ) in order to obtain the @xmath36 couplings that are not constrained experimentally . in the weak sector , only the decay of the @xmath44 and @xmath75 hyperons into nucleons and pions can be experimentally observed . for the other mesons",
    ", @xmath76 represents a convenient tool to obtain the pv amplitudes , while for the pc ones , we use a pole model@xcite with only baryon pole resonances .",
    "details of how these coupling constants are derived can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and , in the recent work on the weak decay of double-@xmath44 hypernuclei @xcite , one can find an updated list of the s - wave ( pv ) and p - wave ( pc ) coupling constants , the latter obtained from the pole model using different parametrizations of the strong bb interaction .",
    "a measure of the amount of parity - violation in the weak decay , is given by the asymmetry in the angular distribution of protons coming from the decay of polarized hypernuclei . this asymmetry is given by : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the polarization of the hypernucleus , characteristic of the production reaction , and @xmath79 the hypernuclear asymmetry parameter , characteristic of the weak decay . in the expression above",
    ", @xmath80 is the spin of the hypernucleus , @xmath81 is the @xmath80-spin operator along the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane , and @xmath82 the hypernuclear transition amplitude . in order to compare with experiments",
    ", one has to multiply @xmath79 by the model dependent quantity @xmath78 , which has to be determined theoretically for each hypernucleus@xcite . by using a shell - model for the initial hypernucleus and assuming spherical configuration with no mixing",
    ", one can express this amplitude in terms of two - body transitions , @xmath7 .",
    "the dependence of weak decay observables on the deformation of the initial ( p - shell ) hypernucleus was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , by means of the nilsson model with angular momentum projection .",
    "it was found that deformation effects change these observables by about 10% from the spherical limit , a deviation that although non - negligible it is smaller than the present experimental uncertainties .",
    "because of the lack of stable hyperon beams , access to the @xmath83 @xmath84 interaction is limited right now to the decay of hypernuclei .",
    "hence , extracting information of the elementary weak two - body interaction requires a careful investigation of the many - body nuclear effects present in the hypernucleus .    on the one hand",
    ", one must consider that the interacting nucleon and @xmath44 hyperon are bound in the nucleus and they should be described by bound - state single - particle wave functions , obtained from appropriate mean - field or hartree - fock potentials .",
    "note , however , that since the mass excess of 176 mev in the initial state is converted into kinetic energy of the final particles , the nucleons emerge with a large momentum of about @xmath85 mev / c and the decay is not very sensitive to the details of the single - particle wave function . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the decay rates obtained from various realistic @xmath44 wave functions differ by at most 15% .",
    "on the other hand , the large momentum transfer implies that the @xmath86 decay process is very sensitive to the short - range correlations induced by the strong interaction . in the initial system , one",
    "must then replace the mean - field two - particle @xmath84 wave function by a correlated one that accounts for the effects of the strong @xmath61 interaction at short distances , which are not considered in mean - field models . correlated wave functions , obtained from the soft and hard core nijmegen @xmath61 interactions @xcite by solving the corresponding finite nucleus scattering amplitude ( @xmath87-matrix ) @xcite , were compared in ref .",
    "the differences between the wave functions obtained with the two models are already significant below 0.75 fm and give rise to decay rates that differ by slightly more than 15% . however ,",
    "since the present @xmath61 models are not constrained enough by the scattering data to resolve this discrepancy , we will admit this uncertainty in our initial @xmath84 wave function .",
    "this uncertainty also justifies the use of a spin - independent parametrization for the @xmath84 correlation function which , when multiplied with the uncorrelated one , was shown to give a decay rate in between those using the soft and hard core correlated wave functions @xcite .",
    "any realistic calculation must also take into account the fact that the two nucleons emerging from the decay feel their mutual influence , as well as that from the residual ( a-2)-particle system .",
    "however , as mentioned before , the most important contribution to the decay comes from the so - called _ back - to - back _ kinematical situation , in which the two nucleons emerge with the largest possible momentum of around 400 mev / c . for these fast moving nucleons the distortions with the residual nucleus",
    "should be small , and the importance of such effects are further diminished for inclusive observables such as the decay rates . in other words , one could take into account the interaction of the emitted nucleons with the residual nucleus through an optical potential .",
    "however , the real part should play a minor role at those high energies , and the imaginary part will remove flux from the @xmath15 channel which will reappear in other multi - nucleon channels , such that the total strength or decay rate , which is the quantity we are interested in , will not be modified . we would face a completely different situation if we were interested in calculating the energy distribution of the nucleons , in which case one should consider these final state interaction effects , which can change the energy , direction and charge of the primary nucleons emitted in the weak @xmath7 transition , producing as well low energy secondary nucleons .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of ref .",
    "@xcite finds indeed that the final state interactions affect the nucleon distributions mostly at energies below 50 mev . in the particular case of @xmath88c",
    ", it is found that final state interactions produce roughly 1/3 more protons at those low energies , half of which are due to charge - exchange reactions , but barely affect the distribution at higher energies and leave the decay rate intact .    since in the present work we will only be interested in the decay rates",
    ", we will limit the treatment of final state interactions to those related to the mutual influence between the two emitted nucleons .",
    "in contrast to the strong @xmath84 interaction , the nucleon - nucleon one is much better constrained by the huge amount of scattering data and , although differences in the wave function can also be observed with various potential models , they are only significant below 0.5 fm , having a moderate influence in the decay rates , as we will see .    in the literature , one finds a variety of ways of dealing with the fsi between the emitted nucleons .",
    "some works do not include fsi , others use a phenomenological correlation function that simply multiplies the uncorrelated one , and others use various approximations to the @xmath15 scattering equation . in the next section we will analyze the sensitivity of the non - mesonic decay observables to these various choices of fsi . the details on how the scattering @xmath15 wave function is obtained from the lippmann - schwinger ( @xmath89-matrix ) equation , as well as from other simplified approximations , are given in the appendix .",
    "we start this section by showing the weak decay observables for and obtained with the model parameters used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but correcting the sign in the appropriate @xmath0 and @xmath1 amplitudes , as pointed out in sect .",
    "ii . hence , we use the coupling constants of the nsc89 strong @xmath61 interaction @xcite , together with a monopole form factor of the type @xmath90 at each vertex .",
    "each meson has a different cut - off value , @xmath44 , and , since this particular nijmegen model distinguishes cut - offs only in terms of the transition channel , we choose , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the values of the jlich @xmath61 interaction @xcite .",
    "the results are collected in table [ tab : paper1 ] and we remind here the main results given in ref .",
    "@xcite for , namely a non - mesonic rate of @xmath91 , where @xmath92 10@xmath93 s@xmath94 is the decay rate of a free @xmath44 , and a neutron - to - proton ratio @xmath95 .    as we see",
    ", the corrected model gives a slightly larger decay rate , together with a remarkable increase in the neutron - to - proton ratio .",
    "this is due to the fact that the corrected sign gives rise to a constructive interference between the @xmath4 and @xmath0 contributions to the @xmath96 @xmath97 pv amplitude , instead of the destructive one found in ref .",
    "@xcite and displayed in fig .",
    "8 of that work . on the other hand ,",
    "the incorporation of @xmath0 exchange to the @xmath4 mechanism lowers the pc amplitudes .",
    "this was pointed out in fig .",
    "7 of ref .",
    "@xcite and figs .  4 and 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the contributions of all different mesons are displayed , the @xmath4 and @xmath0 ones showing a destructive interference in the pc amplitudes .",
    "the present constructive interference in the pv channels is especially relevant in the neutron - induced rate , @xmath98 , which lacks from the pc tensor transition for @xmath99 initial states .",
    "conversely , the proton - induced rate , @xmath100 , is dominated by the pc tensor amplitude , hence its value is lowered when @xmath0 exchange is added to the @xmath4 mechanism , although the reduction will now be more moderate due to the constructive interference in the less dominant pv transition",
    ". altogether , the correct incorporation of @xmath0 exchange produces , in comparison to the results given in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more moderate decrease in the total non - mesonic decay rate , hence a slightly larger rate is now obtained , and a ratio which is almost a factor of 3 larger .",
    "we note that these effects of @xmath0 exchange have also been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath4 and @xmath0 mechanisms are considered together with a description of the decay in terms of quark degrees of freedom , and in the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where , in addition of @xmath4 and @xmath0 exchange , the role of correlated two - pion exchange was also studied .",
    "results for the asymmetry of the emitted protons from the weak decay of polarized hypernuclei are also listed in table [ tab : paper1 ] .",
    "since this is an observable tied to the interference between pv and pc amplitudes , it will also be influenced by the change of sign in the abovementioned pv @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of the asymmetry @xmath79 has increased almost a factor of 2 from the values given in ref .",
    "@xcite which are @xmath101 for and @xmath102 for .",
    "the fact that the new nijmegen potentials @xcite include different form - factors depending on the meson , makes it possible to treat all the strong interaction ingredients involved in the weak decay transition @xmath103 consistently within the same model .",
    "we remind that the strong interaction plays a role not only in the strong vertices and form factors , but also in the pc piece of the weak vertex through the pole model and in the determination of the distorted final state @xmath15 wave function . in table",
    "[ tab : paper2 ] we show the decay observables for and obtained with the models nsc97a and nsc97f .",
    "we observe substantial differences between both models .",
    "these might come from the different coupling constants used in the strong and weak vertices of the transition @xmath7 amplitude , or from the different distorted wave functions . to disentangle both effects ,",
    "we show in table [ tab : paper3 ] the results for @xmath104he , obtained using the same strong interaction model for the vertices , which we choose to be the nsc97f one , and different distorted nn wave functions obtained with four nn interaction models , namely the nsc97a and f @xcite , the nsc93 @xcite and the bonn b potential @xcite . the resulting nn wave functions in various relevant channels are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pots ] for a relative momentum @xmath105 mev / c .",
    "some minor differences appear only in the short distances , which should affect the decay rates moderately . by inspecting the results of table [ tab : paper3 ] , one can indeed see that the non - mesonic decay rates in vary from 0.3 to 0.4@xmath106 , the neutron - to - proton ratio from 0.45 to 0.5 , and the asymmetry from @xmath107 to @xmath108 . in conclusion",
    ", it is mainly the differences associated to the strong couplings and their influence on the weak ones the origin for the differences observed in table [ tab : paper2 ] .",
    "going back to this table , we see that there are already some differences between the results obtained with models nsc97a and nsc97f when the @xmath0 meson contribution is added to the @xmath4 meson one , but this can not explain the differences in the final results when all mesons are included .",
    "compare , for instance , the nonmesonic decay rate in of 0.43 obtained with the nsc97a model versus the value 0.32 obtained with the nsc97f one .",
    "in fact , by analyzing the weak couplings listed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can see some appreciable differences for the @xmath109 coupling constants , which are larger in the nsc97f model , thus enhancing the destructive interference of the @xmath0 meson and producing a reduced rate in this case .",
    "we also observe that the weak vector pc @xmath110 coupling constant obtained from the nsc97a model is one order of magnitude larger than that obtained from the nsc97f one .",
    "this is a consequence of a subtle cancellation in the pole model expression , which involves the difference between the strong @xmath110 and @xmath111 coupling constants .",
    "although both models use the same strong @xmath110 couplings , the differences in the @xmath111 ones induced by the freedom allowed in the magnetic @xmath66 ratio may give rise , as is the case here , to substantial differences in the values of the pc weak coupling constants . the larger value found in the case of the nsc97a model",
    "enhances the constructive interference of the @xmath30 meson contribution and explains the final difference between the decay rate obtained with the two nijmegen models .",
    "this discussion makes also clear that one must admit this amount of uncertainty on meson - exchange models describing the nonmesonic weak decay of hypernuclei .",
    "we should therefore conclude that the nonmesonic decay rate for ranges between 0.55 and 0.73@xmath106 , the neutron to proton ratio between 0.29 and 0.34 , and the hypernuclear asymmetry , more stable , is 0.36 . in ,",
    "the rate obtained lies in the range 0.320.43@xmath106 , in the range 0.340.46 and the hypernuclear asymmetry parameter is @xmath112 .",
    "we observe that our results for the nonmesonic decay rates compare satisfactorily with the experimental data , especially after considering that the size of the nonmesonic two - nucleon induced mechanism , not included here , is around 0.3@xmath106 for medium to heavy hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "the ratio is considerably larger than that found in our previous works and it now lies practically within the lower side of the experimental errors .",
    "we note that a larger ratio could have been obtained , as we show below , if we had used a phenomenological treatment of fsi effects or we had ignored them althogether .",
    "however , we want to stress here that the results shown in table [ tab : paper2 ] have been obtained consistently within the same strong interaction model and that involves also the dynamical generation of the corresponding @xmath15 wave function through a lippmann - schwinger equation .    the asymmetry parameter @xmath79 has increased by more than a factor of two with respect to our previous works . as it has already been mentioned in connection to the results of table  [ tab : paper1 ] , this is a direct consequence of the change of sign in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 exchange pv amplitudes for transitions that do not change the spin @xmath113 , such as @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ transitions ] ) .",
    "indeed , this amplitude interferes with @xmath114 and @xmath115 and the magnitude of the latter tensor amplitude is of especial relevance in meson - exchange models , as the one employed here .",
    "the increased asymmetry values compare less favourably with the experimental data .",
    "while the result for is still within errors , the large negative value obtained here for is very far away from the positive small result obtained in ref .",
    "we note that , using a weak coupling scheme , one can relate the hypernuclear asymmetry parameter @xmath79 to that associated to the elementary reaction @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( see eq .  ( 9 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of , @xmath118 and for",
    "the relation is @xmath119 .",
    "therefore the parameter @xmath117 of the elementary reaction that can be extracted from our results in table [ tab : paper2 ] , turns out to be very similar in both hypernuclei .",
    "however , the present experimental results seem to contradict this finding because a small positive value is obtained for @xcite , while a large negative one was found in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite arguments are given to try to understand these differences on the basis of the fact that is a s - shell nucleus and a p - shell one , the latter one allowing transitions from initial @xmath84 relative @xmath120-wave sates .",
    "however , it was already noticed that most of the decay for p - shell nuclei comes from relative @xmath113-wave initial states @xcite and we have checked here that removing the initial @xmath120-wave amplitudes , the decay rate of using the nsc97f model gets slightly reduced to @xmath121 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath79 only changes to @xmath122 .",
    "hence , meson - exchange models do not explain the present experimental differences between the elementary asymmetry for and , and this seems to be a new puzzle in the study of the weak decay of hypernuclei .",
    "this poses a challenge to the theoretical models and calls for further experimental efforts .",
    "besides valuable new information from hypernuclear weak decay experiments , it is also possible to gain direct information from the inverse reaction @xmath123 , already studied theoretically @xcite and presently under preparation at rcnp ( osaka ) .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper was to study the influence of fsi in the @xmath7 transition .",
    "the results of table [ tab : paper3 ] have already shown that , using nn wave functions obtained from various realistic nn potentials , one obtains similar values for the weak decay observables .",
    "however , one finds in the literature several possibilitites for the treatment of fsi .",
    "they are either ignored , or included through a phenomenological function , such as @xmath124 with @xmath125 fm@xmath94 , multiplying the free nn plane wave , or through a distorted wave function built up from the @xmath0-matrix rather than from the @xmath89-matrix . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsiall ] we show the resulting nn wave functions in various channels for a relative momentum @xmath105 mev / c , obtained from the various approaches to fsi .",
    "the solid lines represent the real and imaginary parts of the wave function obtained from the proper solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation ( @xmath89-matrix ) .",
    "the imaginary part is the minoritary component in all panels .",
    "the dotted line represents the result obtained when only the real part of the @xmath89-matrix is retained in the construction of the distorted wave function from eq .",
    "( [ eq : psipw ] ) , which is further approximated by its principal part value .",
    "this was the prescription followed in ref .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a @xmath0-matrix approximation , which would be the appropriate solution for standing waves , i.e. non - propagating solutions , as is the case in the nuclear medium , where pauli blocking prevents two interacting nucleons of the fermi sea from exciting intermediate nn states that are already occupied by other nucleons .",
    "finally , the dot - dashed line displays the product of the phenomenological correlation function with the corresponding non - interacting bessel function .",
    "we observe important differences beween the various approaches to the treatment of fsi , especially in the case of a phenomenological correlation function .",
    "obviously , this will have an influence on the decay observables .",
    "as an example , we show in table [ tab : paper4 ] the results for , obtained using the nsc97f model and taking all these different treatments for the distorted nn wave functions . the rates can differ substantially , by more than a factor of two in some cases . the neutron - to - proton ratio can also be fictitiously enhanced by using the phenomenological approach to fsi effects , or no fsi at all , while the asymmetry remains more stable .",
    "we have revisited the ome model of ref .",
    "@xcite for the weak nonmesonic decay of hypernuclei to the light of the new nijmegen baryon - baryon potentials @xcite .",
    "these strong interaction models influence the weak decay mechanism , not only through the coupling constants and form factors at the strong vertex involved in the @xmath127 reaction , but also via the pc piece of the weak vertex , obtained from a pole model , as well as from the corresponding correlated wave functions for the initial @xmath84 and final @xmath15 states .    we have paid an especial attention to disentangle the influence of the various model ingredients involved in the decay mechanism . in particular , we have found that the uncertainties tied to the strong coupling constants are a source of uncertainty on the nonmesonic weak decay observables .",
    "employing different strong models of the nijmegen group , and working consistently within each one , we estimate the decay rate of to be in the range 0.320.43@xmath106 , the neutron - to - proton ratio in the range 0.340.46 and the hypernuclear asymmetry parameter @xmath79 around @xmath112 . in the case of",
    ", the decay rate turns out to be in the range 0.550.73@xmath106 , the neutron - to - proton ratio in the range 0.290.34 and the asymmetry @xmath79 around @xmath128 .",
    "the new results for the nonmesonic rates compare favourably with the present experimental data .",
    "the ratio has increased with respect to our previous works and it now lies practically within the lower side of the error band .",
    "the asymmetry for is also compatible with experiment @xcite but that for disagrees strongly from the recent experimental observation @xcite .",
    "the latter work finds a small and positive value for the elementary asymmetry parameter @xmath117 in , while that for is large and negative .",
    "our meson - exchange model does not explain the present experimental differences and understanding this issue is one of the current challenges , both experimental and theoretical , in the study of the weak decay of hypernuclei .",
    "we have found a tremendous influence on the weak decay observables from the way fsi are considered , especially in the case of total and partial decay rates .",
    "a phenomenological implementation of fsi effects , or not including them at all , gives rise to decay rates that differ by more than a factor of two , and to a neutron - to - proton ratio about 20% larger from what is obtained with the more realistic calculation that uses the proper @xmath15 scattering wave function .",
    "the differences observed in the decay rates and the ratio are much larger than the uncertainties tied to the different strong interaction models commented above .",
    "therefore , accurate calculations of the nonmesonic weak decay of hypernuclei demand a proper treatment of fsi effects through the solution of a @xmath89-matrix using realistic nn interactions .",
    "the authors are indebted to k. sasaki and m. oka for many clarifying discussions about the inclusion of the @xmath0-exchange mechanism .",
    "we also thank c. bennhold for many useful suggestions and e. oset for discussions on the effects of an optical nucleon - nucleus potential .",

    "the wave function describing the relative motion of two particles moving under the influence of a two - body potential @xmath129 is obtained from the lippmann - schwinger equation :      where @xmath131 is the free relative motion state , solution of the free schrdinger equation with energy @xmath132 , @xmath133 , with @xmath134 being the relative kinetic energy operator .",
    "the positive ( negative ) sign in front of the infinitesimal quantity @xmath135 arises from the requirement that the relative motion is free in the remote past ( future ) .",

    "isospin is easy to incorporate at the final step of our calculation by multiplying the resulting correlated wave function by the isospinor @xmath154 , allowing only for those cases that fulfil the antisymmetry requirement @xmath155 .",
    "an alternative but approximate way of implementing the @xmath15 final state interactions is through the @xmath0-matrix operator , which obeys : @xmath156 where @xmath157 indicates the cauchy principal value .",
    "standing waves can then be obtained by following the same procedure of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wftmat ] ) through ( [ eq : tmatpw ] ) but replacing the @xmath89-matrix elements by those of the real @xmath0-matrix .",
