    "the electron thermal conductivity is an important kinetic property of plasmas in experimental devices , in metals and semiconductors and in astrophysical objects .",
    "it has been studied for a long time and described in textbooks ( see , e.g. , ziman @xcite , lifshitz and pitaevski @xcite ) .",
    "we will show that some aspects of this problem have to be revised .",
    "specifically , we will consider the thermal conductivity of degenerate electrons .",
    "it is important in metals , semiconductors as well as in degenerate cores of evolved stars ( giants , supergiants and , most importantly , white dwarfs ) , and in envelopes of neutron stars .",
    "it is needed to study cooling of white dwarfs ( e.g. , prada moroni and straniero @xcite ) and nuclear explosions of massive white dwarfs as type ia supernovae ( e.g. , baraffe , heger and woosley @xcite ) . in neutron star envelopes",
    "it is required for many reasons  for simulating cooling of isolated neutron stars ( see , e.g. , lattimer et al .",
    "@xcite , gnedin , yakovlev and potekhin @xcite , page , geppert and weber @xcite ) ; for studying heat propagation and thermal relaxation in a neutron star envelope in response to the various processes of crustal energy release .",
    "in particular , these processes include pulsar glitches ( e.g. , larson and link @xcite , and references therein ) , deep crustal heating of accreting neutron stars in soft x - ray transients ( e.g. , ushomirsky and rutledge @xcite ) , superbursts as powerful nuclear explosions at the base of the outer crust of an accreting neutron star ( e.g. , strohmayer and bildsten @xcite ; page and cumming @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known , that the electrons give the main contribution into the thermal conductivity of strongly degenerate matter .",
    "their thermal conductivity can be written as @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 is the number density of electrons , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the electron chemical potential ( including the rest - mass term ) , and @xmath7 is the total effective electron collision frequency .",
    "the latter frequency is the sum of the partial collision frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in @xmath8",
    "we include all collisions of electrons mediated by their interactions with ions ( direct coulomb scattering of electrons by ions in an ion gas or liquid ; electron - phonon scattering in an ion crystal and electron scattering by impurity ions at low temperatures ) .",
    "evidently , eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath10 where the partial conductivities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are determined , respectively , by the @xmath13 and @xmath14 collisions .",
    "it is widely believed that the dominant contribution into @xmath15 comes from the @xmath13 collisions .",
    "the associated partial conductivity @xmath11 has been studied in a number of papers ( e.g. , potekhin et al .",
    "@xcite , gnedin et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the partial thermal conductivity @xmath12 owing to the @xmath14 collisions was calculated by lampe @xcite , flowers and itoh @xcite , urpin and yakovlev @xcite , and timmes @xcite .",
    "these calculations were summarized by potekhin et al .",
    "the main result was that the @xmath14 collisions are mainly negligible , except for a hot low - density plasma of light elements ( from hydrogen to carbon ) with the temperature a few times lower than the electron degeneracy temperature ( in that case the @xmath14 collisions did affect @xmath16 but never dominated as long as the electrons were degenerate ; see lampe @xcite ; urpin and yakovlev @xcite ) .",
    "however , all these calculations have neglected an important effect of the landau damping of the @xmath14 interaction owing to the exchange of transverse plasmons . in the context of transport properties of dense matter",
    "this effect was studied by heiselberg and pethick @xcite for degenerate quark plasmas .",
    "similar effects have recently been analyzed by jaikumar , gale and page @xcite for neutrino bremsstrahlung radiation in the @xmath14 collisions . here",
    "we reconsider @xmath12 including the effects of the landau damping and show that @xmath12 is actually much more important than thought before .",
    "we analyze the thermal conductivity @xmath12 of strongly degenerate electrons under the conditions that the electrons constitute an almost ideal and uniform fermi gas and collide between themselves and with plasma ions .",
    "although the results will be more important for ultrarelativistic electrons , our consideration will be general and valid for both , relativistic and non - relativistic , cases .",
    "we will use the same standard variational approach with the simplest trial non - equilibrium electron distribution function as flowers and itoh @xcite .",
    "the calculations are similar to those performed by heiselberg and pethick @xcite for the thermal conductivity of quarks ; thus we omit the details .    following heiselberg and",

    "the symmetry factors required to avoid double counting of the same initial and final electron states are also included into @xmath27 .",
    "the multi - dimensional integral ( [ nuee ] ) is simplified further using the standard angular - energy decomposition ( separating integrations over particle energies and orientations of their momenta ; e.g. , shapiro and teukolsky @xcite ) . because the electrons are strongly degenerate ,",
    "they can participate in thermal conduction only if their energies are close to the fermi level .",
    "accordingly , their momenta can be placed at the fermi surface in angular integrals whenever possible .",
    "characteristic energy transfers @xmath28 in collisions of strongly degenerate particles are small , @xmath29 .",
    "momentum transfers @xmath30 are also small , @xmath31 , owing to a long - range nature of the coulomb interaction .",
    "we will use this small - momentum - transfer approximation throughout the paper .",
    "typical values of @xmath32 are determined by plasma screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the plasma screening was thoroughly analyzed by heiselberg and pethick @xcite .",
    "these authors studied quark - quark interaction through one - gluon exchange in the weak - coupling limit which is very similar to the coulomb interaction in an ordinary plasma .",
    "the matrix element for an @xmath14 scattering event is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35correspond to the channels @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "for instance , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the transition 4-current ( @xmath40=0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) , @xmath41 is the component of @xmath42 transverse to @xmath43 , @xmath44 is a dirac matrix , @xmath45 is a normalized electron bispinor ( @xmath46 ) , and @xmath47 is a dirac conjugate ( see , e.g. , berestetski , lifshitz and pitaevskii @xcite ) .",

    "the difference results from the difference of the polarization functions @xmath50 and @xmath49 and has been neglected in all previous calculations of the electron thermal conductivity ( where one has commonly set @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ) .",
    "naturally , this difference is expected to be small for non - relativistic electrons ( @xmath64 ) , where the transverse current interaction term is small in the matrix element .",
    "we will see that the difference becomes important for relativistic electrons ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "let us recall that the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 have real parts which describe plasmon refraction , and imaginary parts which describe plasmon absorption . in the @xmath14 scattering we deal with low - energy virtual plasmons , @xmath66 . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ polariz1 ] ) , longitudinal plasmons undergo refraction which results in the debye - type ( thomas - fermi ) screening of the coulomb interaction , with the screening momentum ( inverse screening length ) @xmath58 . as for transverse plasmons",
