    "we still know little about how radio galaxies are born and how they subsequently evolve , but it is generally accepted that the ghz peaked spectrum ( gps ) and compact steep spectrum ( css ) radio sources are young , smaller versions of the large - scale powerful radio sources @xcite . recently , the high frequency peakers have been added to the sequence , as possible progenitors of gps sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the gps and css sources are powerful but compact radio sources whose spectra are generally simple and convex with peaks near 1 ghz and 100 mhz respectively .",
    "the gps sources are contained within the extent of the optical narrow emission line region ( @xmath0 kpc ) while the css sources are contained within the host galaxy ( @xmath1 kpc , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .    in the general scenario of the evolution of powerful radio - loud agns ,",
    "gps sources evolve into css sources and these into supergalactic - size fri or frii objects @xcite .",
    "the dynamic evolution of the double - lobed radio sources , characterized by the total extent of the source , advance speed of the hotspots and the dependence of the density distribution of the interstellar and intergalactic medium along the way of the propagating jets and lobes , predicts the increase of the radio power with the linear size of the source in the gps and css phase until they * reach * the 1 - 3kpc size .",
    "then the larger css objects should start to slowly decrease their luminosity but the sharp radio power decrease is visible only in the fri and frii phase of evolution @xcite . finally , after the cut off of the material supply to the central engine of the galaxy , the sources begin their fading phase .",
    "they can come back on the main evolutionary sequence after the re - ignition of the radio activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath2 means no detection , only upper limit for flux .",
    "+ @xmath3 means @xmath4=1.7 was assumed for the flux calculation .        however , population studies have drawn attention to the existence of far too many compact sources compared to the number of large - scale objects @xcite . it has been proposed then that some of the young radio - loud agns , namely the gps and css sources , can be short - lived objects @xcite and that not one but a few evolutionary paths exist @xcite .",
    "detection of several candidates for dying compact sources",
    "@xcite supports this view .",
    "the determining factors for the further evolution of compact radio objects could occur at sub - galactic ( or even nuclear ) scales , or they could be related to the radio jet - ism interactions and evolution .",
    "our previous studies suggest that the evolutionary track could be related to the interaction , strength of the radio source , and excitation levels of the ionized gas @xcite , instead of the radio morphology of the young radio source .    the characteristics ( size , radio power and young age ) of gps and css sources make them excellent probes of interaction ( and therefore evolution ) of radio sources .",
    "furthermore , they have not completely broken through the ism , so these interactions are expected to be more important than in the larger sources .",
    "observations of uv , hi and , especially , of the ionized gas in gps and css sources suggest the presence of such interactions @xcite .",
    "additional clues on the evolution of compact gps and css sources may come from the x - ray band , but still little is known about the nature of the x - ray emission in these young sources .",
    "theoretical models predict strong x - ray emission from young radio sources , due to the recent triggering of the nuclear activity and/or the expansion through the ism .",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of gps and css objects made so far have focused on sources with high radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these sources , when included in the l@xmath5 kev versus l@xmath6 diagram , group in the region occupied by powerful frii sources @xcite",
    "therefore , the location of gps and css sources in the radio to x - ray luminosity diagram is consistent with them being powered by accretion , and therefore evolving onto a track of constant x - ray , accretion - driven luminosity to friis , as well as with the correlation between radio and x - ray luminosity observed in fris , which would point to a common origin for the emission in these two bands .    in this paper",
    ", we present the first x - ray observations of low power radio sources , starting to fill the gap in the l@xmath5 kev versus l@xmath6 diagram , and shedding some light on the origin of high - energy emission of young radio sources and their evolution .",
    "the current sample consists of 7 sources ( 0810 + 077 , 0907 + 049 , 0942 + 355 , 1321 + 045 , 1542 - 390 , 1558 + 536 , 1624 + 049 ) taken from the low luminosity compact sources sample ( llc , * ? ? ?",

    "the llc consists of 44 nearby ( z@xmath70.9 ) sources , selected from the final release of first @xcite , and the gb6 @xcite and sdss surveys , and observed with merlin at l - band and c - band .",
    "the main selection criterion for the llc was the luminosity limit : l@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "the radio and optical properties of the llc were discussed and analyzed in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the 7 current sources form the so called _ pilot sample _ and were selected to represent different stages of the radio source evolution within the ism : weak or undetected radio core and strong lobes or breaking up radio lobes with bright radio core , and linear sizes ranging from 2 to 17 kpc .",

    "acis - s3 with 1/8 subarray and standard pointings , with exposure times of @xmath10 9500 seconds ( see table [ observations ] ) .",
