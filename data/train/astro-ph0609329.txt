    "in the early stages of the collaboration between the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) and the european southern observatory ( eso ) toward the joint design , construction and operation of a large millimeter array ( now called the atacama large millimeter array , or `` alma '' , project ) , it was agreed that each of the partners would acquire from industry a prototype of the planned 12 m diameter antennas .",
    "the specifications of these antennas are beyond the current state of the art in accurate reflector antenna technology . considering that 64 of these antennas would eventually be needed , this step appeared warranted to mitigate performance risk and increase competition among prospective manufacturers .",
    "it was also agreed to place the antennas next to each other at a suitable site and subject them to an extensive evaluation program to be carried out by a joint team of scientists and engineers drawn from the institutes of the alma collaboration .",
    "the two alma prototype antennas are located at the site of the very large array ( vla ) in new mexico .",
    "this site provides a reasonable compromise between the quality of the atmosphere , necessary for millimeter wavelength operation , and ease of construction and operation .",
    "the latter is provided by the existing infrastructure of the vla site .",
    "the atmospheric characteristics however allow only operation at relatively long millimeter wavelengths during the dry winter months .",
    "thus , the antennas have been equipped with evaluation receivers for the wavelength bands near 3 and 1.2 mm .",
    "the evaluation of the antennas has been carried out by the antenna evaluation group ( aeg ) , consisting of experienced `` antenna integrators and commissioners '' from both organizations , associated universities incorporated ( aui)/national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) and the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "the charge of the aeg was to subject both antennas to a series of identical tests that would indicate the compliance ( or not ) of the antennas with the specifications .",
    "the core of the aeg is composed of the authors of this paper .",
    "the alma prototype antennas are alt - azimuth mounted cassegrain reflector systems of 12  m diameter with a reflector surface and pointing accuracy suitable for observations in the 0.3 mm submillimeter band .",
    "vertexrsi delivered an antenna to aui / nrao ( see figure  [ fig : vertexrsi ] ) and eso obtained an antenna from the consortium alcatel / eie ( aec ; see figure  [ fig : aec ] ) .",
    "the main characteristics of the antennas are summarized in table  [ tab : antennas ] .",
    ".main properties of the alma prototype antennas [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : radfsobs ]    in summary , the analysis of these measurements proceeded as follows :    1 .   to calibrate the conversion from total power level to source offset we collected a series of three beam - switched total power measurements at offsets of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6  arcsec from the half - power point of jupiter .",
    "these data indicate the total power should change by about 0.160 for every arcsecond of pointing offset in the direction of the offset . in the following",
    "we adopt this value for the change in total power versus position .",
    "the true scaling factor will be very close to this for the el scans , but the az scans could have a scaling factor significantly different from this , _",
    "i.e. _  as low as 0.11 , which will increase the radiometrically inferred az errors by as much as 50% due to uncertainties in the interpretation of the unmeasured peak flux for jupiter .",
    "note that the rms of the 0.1  second data samples when off of jupiter were typically 0.033 . at 0.160 per arcsec , this indicates that the radiometer noise is equivalent to a jitter of 0.21  arcsec .",
    "averaging for longer times can give us estimates of pointing errors with smaller uncertainties .",
    "2 .   for each 0.1  second time stamp since the start of a slew ( there are 20 slewing profiles going toward jupiter per scan ) we calculate the rms of the measured total power minus the mean total power calculated from the last half of all 20 blocks in the scan , and divide by our calibration factor of 0.16 amplitude / arcsec . all 20 slew profiles within a given scan are then aligned and averaged to derive the radiometrically - inferred pointing error as a function of time , all shifted so they align with the slew that got on source fastest .",
    "a representative sample of these results is shown in figure  [ fig : radfs ] . +    0.21  arcsec/@xmath7 = 0.05  arcsec.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.21  arcsec/@xmath7 = 0.05  arcsec.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    0.21  arcsec/@xmath7 = 0.05  arcsec.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.21  arcsec/@xmath7 = 0.05  arcsec.,title=\"fig : \" ] 3 .   by averaging the approximately 500 samples made during the last - half of each scan a measure of the radiometric tracking accuracy , which includes contributions from the antenna and atmospheric fluctuations ,",
    "was derived for the vertexrsi antenna .",
    "typical values of 0.6  arcsec per axis , or about 0.8  arcsec total , were measured .",
    "4 .   in the aec antenna measurements",
    "we note that there is a 5  hz oscillation in the positioning .",
    "this is a real mechanical effect because : * it has too much power at too small a time scale to fit with the atmospheric pointing error structure function , * it is seen in the encoder data ( offset by 0.1  s ) , * it is not seen in the tracking data , * it seems to get excited as the telescope stops , and dies down with time ( _ i.e. _  the telescope is settling down ) .",
    "+ the peak to peak of this positioning oscillation is about 0.4  arcsec .",
    "this oscillation has been identified as due to a mechanical oscillation of the apex structure ( @xcite ) .      using radiometric and encoder data ,",
    "we have investigated the mechanical aspects of the fast switching performance of the alma prototype antennas .    *",
    "the vertexrsi antenna basically meets the fast switching specification of `` 1.5  degrees in 1.5  seconds to an accuracy of 3  arcseconds '' .",
    "the antenna achieves pointing errors of about 0.8  arcsec rms if a bit more settle time is permitted .",
    "minor improvements in the software and servo systems could improve the fast switching capability .",
    "we find that for night time observing , the encoders and the radiometrically - inferred pointing errors agree remarkably well .",
    "after the slew has been completed and the antenna is pointing on source , pointing drifts of under 1  arcsec over 2  seconds of time , and pointing jitter of amplitude 0.3  arcsec and frequency 3  hz can be seen clearly in both the encoder pointing and the radiometrically - inferred pointing . on average , the encoders and radiometrically - determined",
    "pointing differs by 0.28  arcsec rms while slewing and 0.15  arcsec after settling . *",
    "radiometric and encoder data from the aec prototype antenna indicate that the aec antenna meets the fast switching motion requirements .",
    "we see that as the aec antenna comes to rest after a fast slew , a 5  hz oscillation is excited by the fast switching motion , and that the peak amplitude of this oscillation is about 0.4  arcsec , which dies out over a few seconds .",
    "accelerometer measurements have identified this oscillation as being due to a rotation of the apex structure ( @xcite ) . for the measurements performed in this report",
    ", this oscillation does not prevent the aec antenna from meeting the fast switching specification .      from the accelerometer measurements with comparison to the antenna encoder position information we gain an insight into the settling time after the fast position switch .",
    "we find that the vertexrsi antenna can perform a fast switch in the prescribed time and positioning limits , but not for all directions .",
    "there are no indications that the aec antenna does not meet the fast motion and settling time specifications .",
    "the path length stability of the antenna structures was measured using an automated precision incorporated ( api ) 5-d laser interferometer ( @xcite ) and an accelerometer system ( @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we describe the path length stability measurement results for both prototype antennas .",
    "detailed descriptions of the technical capabilities of each measurement system are given in the associated references .",
    "an automated precision incorporated 5d ( api5d ) laser interferometer was used to measure the individual structural components that compose the total interferometric path length through the antennas .",
    "laser interferometers are used to measure variations in `` straightness '' along a given path .",
    "one component of this `` straightness '' is the path length variation ( @xmath8z ) . for the measurements made of the alma prototype antennas the accuracy in ( @xmath8z ) is better than 1@xmath0 m for an enclosed path , and 2 to 3@xmath0 m for an open  air path .",
    "since the total path length variation can not be made with a single measurement , the total path length was separated into four parts ( pedestal , fork arm , central receiver flange to subreflector , and subreflector to surface ) and measured during a representative sample of observing conditions and operation modes .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : pathparts ] , these measurements contain        l1 : : :    path length inside the pedestal = distance between the foundation    ( ground ) and the lower face of the azimuth(az)bearing ; it was not    possible to measure this path length on the aec antenna ; l2 : : :    path length inside ( one ) fork arm ( left , right ) = distance between the    lower part of the traverse and the upper part of the left ( right ) fork    arm , below the elevation ( el) bearing ; l3 : : :    path length along the radio axis = distance between the upper part of    the invar cone ( vertexrsi ) , or the vertex hole ( aec , laser tracker    mount ) of the main reflector , and the apex of the subreflector ; ( in    the measurements the dilatation of the aluminum subreflector support    tube ( 50 cm length ) has been eliminated , as far as possible ; l4 : : :    path length of the reflector = distance between the invar cone / vertex    hole and a point of the reflector surface , measured via the    subreflector . on both antennas",
    "this path length measurement was tested    but not routinely performed , mainly because of difficult alignment and    time limitations . since , in essence",
    ", this path length component    originates in the cfrp part of the antennas , at least a temperature    induced path length variation is expected to be small .",
    "the full path length variation is approximately the sum of the measured components .",

    "we investigate the path length dependence of both prototype antennas under a variety of the individual load conditions that went into the overall performance quoted above .      for purposes of path length prediction ,",
    "we have searched for correlation of the path length changes with the steel temperature of the pedestal and the fork arms , the ambient air temperature , and the wind speed .",
    "the correlation of the fork arm path length change @xmath8l@xmath11 is shown for the vertexrsi antenna in figure  [ fig : vertex - corr - t - l2 ] , and for the aec antenna in figure  [ fig : aec - corr - t - l2 ] . as expected , the correlation of the path length change @xmath8l@xmath11 with the change of the fork arm steel temperature is good , and usable for prediction . on the vertexrsi antenna ,",
    "a similarly useful correlation was found for the path length of the pedestal ( l@xmath9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is no correlation between path length variation and ambient air temperature or wind speed variation .",
    "a dedicated investigation of the path length changes with variations in wind speed was difficult due to logistical reasons .",
    "for one particular day , with changes of the wind speed ( v ) from @xmath105 m/s to @xmath1015 m/s , the path length variation @xmath8l@xmath11 ( fork arm ) of the vertexrsi antenna was measured , which hinted at a slight increase in @xmath8l@xmath11 with increasing wind speed .",
    "however , the measured variation of l@xmath11 remains within the specification even for the largest observational wind speed of v = 9 m/s .",
    "there are no data for the aec antenna .",
    "both prototype antennas have temperature sensors installed on the steel walls inside the fork arms . from these recordings",
    "we have derived the average , maximum , and minimum temperature of each fork arm .",

    "function l@xmath11(t ) = l@xmath17 + @xmath8l@xmath18 , with @xmath19 = 2@xmath20/24h and t = time , the path length variation @xmath8l@xmath11 at a 3,10,and 30 minute time interval can be derived by differentiation of the function l@xmath11(t ) .",
    "the corresponding result is shown by solid lines in figure  [ fig : path - fem ] , which gives an explanation of the double peaked form of the measured variations .",
    "the minima of @xmath8l@xmath11 occur around 0@xmath21 and 14@xmath21 ut where the temperature changes of the ambient air and of the steel of the fork are smallest .    as is evident from figure  [ fig : path - fem ] ,",

    "the laser emitter of the api5d was installed on a mount ( specially constructed for the vertexrsi antenna ; the laser tracker platform on the aec antenna ) at the reflector vertex , the retro  reflector was installed on the subreflector .",
    "the measurements of the l@xmath12 path length variation as function of elevation are reliable because the measurements are insensitive to a small tilt of the laser mount relative to the antenna structure , and hence of the laser beam reflected in the retro  reflector . the antennas were tipped in elevation in steps of 15@xmath24 , between 5@xmath24 ( aec ) or 15@xmath24 ( vertexrsi ) and 90@xmath24 elevation , and the variation of @xmath8l@xmath12(e ) was recorded .",

    "the boresight motion of the bus is subtracted from twice the boresight motion of the apex structure , which results in the total path length variation with respect to ground . as was done for the pointing results derived from accelerometer measurements ( see  [ accelpoint ] ) in the following we characterize antenna path length stability performance for the following situations :    stationary pointing in high wind : : :    wind induced total path length variations for both antennas amount to    6  @xmath0 m rms over time scales of 15  minutes .",

    "in fulfilling its task the aeg was limited by a number of circumstances .",

    "this formed the most serious limitation to our evaluation program .",
    "instead , we have employed a number of optical - mechanical measurement devices in an effort to obtain sufficient material for a valid evaluation of the antennas .",
    "large delays in the delivery of the antennas shortened the evaluation process and limited the extent to which performance specifications could be tested .",
    "the vertexrsi antenna was marginally put at our disposal in march 2003 , the aec antenna in january 2004 .",
    "neither antenna was fully functional at those times .",
    "summarizing , our ability to measure the full performance of the prototype antennas was limited in the following areas :    1 .",
    "the holographic surface measurement was limited to one elevation angle .",
    "some data on the reflector surface deformation as a function of elevation was obtained with optical methods .",
    "the atmospheric conditions at the vla site are quite different from those at the alma site on chajnantor , chile . comparing the temperature and wind variations encountered at the vla site with those at chajnantor , it has been possible to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the behaviour of the antennas under the conditions specified for chajnantor . however , at the vla the atmospheric transmission only allows observations at the longer mm - wavelengths and over a limited ( winter ) period of the year .",
    "this has significantly impeded the quantity and quality of the radiometric tests .",
    "moreover , we found that the vla site has poor seeing - seldom better than 4  arcsec .",
    "this made the optical measurements of the important tracking and offsetting performance below 1  arcsec difficult to determine .",
    "radiometric pointing measurements are the final criterion for the determination of the pointing behaviour .",
    "the system temperatures of the evaluation receivers are excellent ; however the limits set by gain fluctuations were factors of order 20 ( at 3 mm ) and 10 ( at 1 mm ) above the thermal fluctuations .",
    "thus our limiting sensitivity was entirely set by gain stability at the 10 hz switching frequency , restricting the number of available sources to @xmath27 at 3 mm wavelength .",
    "the nutator could only operate reliably under quiet or moderately windy conditions ( a few m / s ) .",
    "only a limited set of data could be collected at the vertexrsi antenna , and even less on the aec antenna .",

    "alignment errors after a drop of the antenna during transportation .",

    "considering these circumstances , it is gratifying to report that we were able to collect an amount of data that allows us to draw meaningful conclusions as to the performance of the alma prototype antennas .",
