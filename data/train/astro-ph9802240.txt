    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , as observed in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen , provide , in many cases , an accurate determination of the radial force distribution in regions of very low gravitational acceleration ( @xmath1 cm / s@xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , these data are ideal for testing alternatives to dark matter such as milgrom s proposed modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) which posits that the discrepancy between the true gravitational force and the newtonian force appears at low accelerations . as a theory of gravity or inertia , mond predicts the precise form and amplitude of a rotation curve from the observed radial distribution of detectable matter ( stars and gas ) in a spiral galaxy , often with only one adjustable parameter which is the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disk ( milgrom 1983a , b ) .    in two previous papers ( begeman et al .",
    "1990 paper 1 , sanders 1996 paper 2 ) , a sample of 33 spiral galaxies with published rotation curves has been considered in the context of mond .",
    "the 11 galaxies considered in paper 1 were highly selected to meet certain strict criteria : the galaxies were rich in neutral hydrogen ; the distribution and velocity field of the neutral gas was smooth and symmetric ; the observed 21 cm line rotation curves extended far beyond the visible disk ; the galaxies were closer than 1000 km / s to achieve high linear resolution and a large number of independent points along the rotation curve . in paper 2",
    "these criteria were relaxed to include an additional 22 galaxies with published 21 cm line rotation curves ( as of 1996 ) , but selection was still essentially based upon hi richness and extent . for the combined samples of papers 1 and 2 it was demonstrated that , in most cases , the observed rotation curve was predicted in detail from the observed light and gas distributions using the simple mond prescription .",
    "moreover , the range of fitted values of m / l was astrophysically plausible and consistent with population synthesis models .",
    "in the present paper , this work is extended to a new complete and homogeneous sample of spiral galaxies in the ursa major cluster .",
    "the sample has been previously considered in terms of the distribution by surface brightness ( tully & verheijen 1997 ) , but until now , the dynamics of these galaxies has not been discussed in the published literature .",
    "the important aspect of this sample is that it is optically selected ( tully et al .",
    "all galaxies in the uma cluster brighter than a specified limiting magnitude are considered ; although , the final sample is weighted against gas - poor systems because the rotation curves are determined from 21 cm line observations made at the westerbork radio synthesis telescope ( verheijen 1997 ) .",
    "all sample galaxies have been imaged in the k@xmath0-band ( 2.2 @xmath3 m ) by tully et al .",
    "therefore , this sample is distinguished from the previous samples in its primary selection criterion and by its homogeneity : rotation curves of consistent and sufficient linear resolution are combined with near - infrared surface photometry in a data set which is well - suited to the purpose of this work .",
    "the previous combined sample of 33 field galaxies ( paper 2 ) was very inhomogeneous with the 21 cm line observations being carried out at either westerbork or the vla with differing angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "considering the range of distance covered by the sample ( from 0.8 to 80 mpc ) the actual linear resolution of the neutral hydrogen observations varied between about 50 pc and 5 kpc .",
    "the 21 cm line data were taken by different observers using different methods of analysis .",
    "the photometry was quite inhomogeneous ; in most cases this was ccd photometry but for several objects only older photographic photometry was available .",
    "the photometry was typically , but not always , in the b - band which is less reliable than redder bands as a tracer of the true radial distribution of the dominant stellar population , subject as it is to recent star - formation and the effects of differential dust obscuration .",
    "moreover , nine of these galaxies contained bulges or central light concentrations which , at least in the b - band , yielded yet another fitting parameter the m / l of the bulge component .",
    "these problems are minimized in the uma sample .",
    "all galaxies are roughly at the same distance ( taken to be 15.5 mpc ) which means that the linear resolution of the 21 cm line observations is similar in all cases ( typically 0.75 kpc ) .",
    "the relatively low scatter in the observed tully - fisher relation implies a rather small dispersion in distance .",
    "the observations are reduced in the same way and the same method is applied in deriving the rotation curves from the line data ( verheijen 1997 ) .",
    "one of the greatest advantages of this sample is that the radial distribution of the old stellar population is determined from near - infrared ( k@xmath0-band ) ccd photometry which is free from the above - mentioned problems associated with the b - band .",
    "the galaxies are generally of quite late morphological type and the effects of a separate bulge component with a spheroidal shape and separate m / l are minimal . indeed ,",
    "the m / l in the near - infrared is probably similar for the disk and the presumably older bulge component .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that this is an _ optically _ selected sample ; these galaxies are not selected for hi richness or the large extent of the neutral hydrogen disks . in many of these objects",
    "the neutral hydrogen does not extend far beyond the optical disk into the region of low accelerations where the discrepancy between the visible and classical dynamical mass is large . both high and low surface - brightness galaxies are present , as well as a range of morphological types .",
    "overall , this must be considered an advantage ; it can not be argued that these galaxies were picked as cases particularly favorable to analysis in terms of mond .",
    "moreover , the range of objects and accelerations probed illustrate some significant general characteristics of the mass discrepancy in spiral galaxies .    however , this complete and homogeneous sample is not completely free from problems . because it is an optically selected sample , in a number of these objects the hi mass is low and its distribution is patchy not ideal for derivation of a high - quality rotation curve .",
    "the distance to these galaxies is rather large compared to that of the galaxies in the highly selected sub - sample of paper 1 .",
    "combined with the fact that a number of the galaxies have a small angular size , the number of independent points on the measured rotation curve is , in several cases , quite low ( less than five ) .",
    "the relatively poor linear resolution means that real structure in the rotation curve can be artificially smoothed ( beam smearing ) .",
    "these galaxies are members of a cluster , albeit a loose cluster , and therefore quite a number of objects are interacting with near neighbors .",
    "this may complicate the interpretation of the neutral hydrogen velocity field as pure circular motion about the center of the galaxy . taking these factors into account , the measured rotation curves , as tracers of the radial force law , are generally inferior to those of paper 1 , although the photometry is superior and the relative error in distance is smaller .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we have carried out the mond analysis on the galaxies in the uma sample .",
    "this adds between 20 and 30 rotation curves ( depending upon internal selection criteria ) to the total number considered in the context of this theory .",
    "the results are generally positive for modified dynamics ; the predicted rotation curves agree with the observed curves and the range of implied m / l values is reasonable . in the k@xmath0 band ,",
    "the scatter in m / l is strikingly small : the mean m / l is about one in solar units with a dispersion of 30% .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the scatter in the observed k@xmath0-band tf relation ( verheijen 1997 ) ; in the context of mond the only source of intrinsic scatter in the tf relation is that in m / l , assuming planar gas disks in circular rotation .",
    "below we describe the sample , show the predicted and observed rotation curves and discuss the implications for the hypotheses of modified dynamics and dark matter .",
    "tully et al . ( 1996 ) identify 79 members of the ursa major cluster .",
    "the mean recession velocity is 950 km / s with a dispersion of 150 km / s .",
    "following tully & verheijen ( 1997 ) , the distance to all galaxies in the sample is assumed to be 15.5 mpc , although there is certainly a dispersion of one or two mpc about this mean .",
    "there are 62 galaxies brighter than m@xmath4 @xmath5 that form a complete sample , and all of these have been imaged in the b , r , i , and k@xmath0 bands ( tully et al .",
    "the hi velocity fields have been measured for most of these galaxies , but only 50 are sufficiently inclined ( generally more than 45 degrees ) to be suitable for kinematic studies . of these , 20 are either early types poor in hi , are strongly interacting with neighbors , or have fewer than five independent points along the measured rotation curve . of the remaining 30 ,",
    "seven objects show kinematic evidence of velocity fields with significant deviations from circular motion due to interactions or non - axisymmetric structure ( bars ) .",
    "this leaves a sample of 23 objects which are free from obvious problems ( verheijen 1997 ) .",
    "the sample of 30 ( including the kinematically disturbed systems ) is listed in table 1 along with the observed properties .",
    "the objects are listed in column 1 along with the morphological type in column 2 .",
    "those systems previously designated by verheijen ( 1997 ) as having a disturbed velocity field are indicated by an asterisk , and the ` l ' in parenthesis by the morphological type indicates that the galaxy is in the low surface - brightness category ( lsb ) as defined by tully & verheijen ( 1997 ) .",
    "the b - band and k@xmath0-band luminosities are given in columns 3 and 4 .",
    "the radial extent of the optical disk in the k@xmath0-band , or more specifically , the radius containing 80% of the near - infrared emission , is given in column 5 , and the radial extent of the neutral hydrogen in column 6 .",
    "the rotation velocity at the outer most reliable point is given in column 7 and the centripetal acceleration in units of @xmath6 cm / s@xmath2 in column 8 .",
    "we notice that in several cases , the neutral hydrogen does not extend beyond the visible disk ( e.g. ngc 3877 , ngc 3949 ) ; thus , these are not extended rotation curves as considered in papers 1 and 2 .",
    "moreover , for several galaxies the centripetal acceleration at the outer most point is higher than the previously determined value ( paper 1 ) of the mond acceleration parameter ( @xmath7 cm / s@xmath2 ) ; therefore , in the context of mond one would not expect a large discrepancy in these systems .    in several of the earlier type galaxies the mean radial distribution of surface - brightness",
    "does show evidence for a central bulge component or at least a central light concentration .",
    "however , we assume that , in the near - infrared , the difference in m / l between the bulge and disk is small , and the light distribution is not decomposed into separate bulge and disk components as in papers 1 and 2 ( this is justified by the results obtained below ) .",
    "the procedure for calculating and fitting mond rotation curves to the observed curves is exactly as described in papers 1 and 2 .",
    "it is assumed that the azimuthally averaged radial profile of k@xmath0-band emission precisely traces the stellar mass distribution in an infinitesimally thin , axisymmetric disk ; that is to say , we assume that there is no variation of the stellar m / l within a given galaxy , and the entire galactic mass , including any possible bulge component , is distributed in a thin disk .",
    "the gas mass distribution is assumed to lie in a thin disk and to be traced by the mean radial distribution of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the neutral hydrogen surface density is increased by a factor of 1.3 to account for the contribution of helium .",
    "thus given the distribution of observable matter , the newtonian gravitational acceleration @xmath8 is calculated in the usual way ( see begeman 1987 ) .",
    "the modified dynamics posits that the true gravitational acceleration @xmath9 is related to the newtonian acceleration as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mond acceleration parameter and @xmath12 which is the commonly assumed form having the required asymptotic behavior ; i.e. , gravity is newtonian at high accelerations but is of the mond form @xmath13 at low accelerations ( milgrom 1983a ) .",
    "the predicted rotation curve is determined by setting the true gravitational acceleration equal to the centripetal acceleration as usual ; i.e. , @xmath14 this is then fit in a least - square program to the observed rotation curve by adjusting the mass of the luminous stellar disk , the one free parameter of the fitting algorithm .",
    "the acceleration parameter is not allowed to be free but is taken to be the value determined from the fits to the high quality rotation curves of paper 1 ; i.e. , @xmath15 cm / s@xmath2 .",
    "the distance is fixed at the value of 15.5 mpc .",
    "tully and verheijen ( 1997 ) state that this distance is compatible with @xmath16 km / s - mpc given the complex velocity field in the local super - cluster .",
    "taking a mean radial velocity for the cluster of 1000 km / s , this distance would also be compatible with a smooth hubble flow and @xmath17 km / s - mpc .",
    "the value of @xmath11 derived in paper 1 was based upon galaxy distances estimated by taking @xmath18 km / s - mpc ; thus , it is not immediately evident that this same @xmath11 is consistent with the adopted distance to the uma cluster . therefore the mond rotation curve fitting was repeated taking distance as a free parameter in addition to m / l . eliminating 10 extreme values ( resulting from the attempt of the least square program to accommodate all points on possibly beam - smeared curves ) the mean distance",
    "is found to be 15.2 @xmath19 mpc .",
    "thus the assumed distance would seem to be consistent with the previously determined value of @xmath11 ( and with @xmath18 km / s - mpc ) .",
    "it should be noted that , in the context of mond , the internal dynamics of a system is affected by the external acceleration field ; i.e. , when the external acceleration becomes comparable to or larger than @xmath11 , the internal dynamics is newtonian , even though the internal accelerations may be smaller than @xmath11 ( milgrom 1983a , b ) . because the galaxies in this sample are members of a cluster , the magnitude of this external field effect should be considered .",
    "given that the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the uma cluster is 150 km / s and that the characteristic size of the cluster is 1 mpc , we find that the cluster acceleration on galaxies is typically on the order of @xmath20 @xmath11 ; therefore , the individual galaxies may be considered as isolated systems because the centripetal accelerations at the outer - most measured point of the rotation curve are typically more than 100 times greater than the cluster acceleration field ( table 1 ) .",
    "note that the low internal acceleration within the cluster would , in terms of mond , imply a large conventional virial discrepancy .",
    "however , the dynamical time - scale is longer than the hubble time ; the cluster is not virialized .",
    "the results are given in fig .  1 and table 2 .",
    "as in paper 2 , the observed curve is shown by the points with error bars ; the predicted mond curve is given by the solid line ; the newtonian rotation curve of the stellar disk corresponding to the mond fit is given by the dotted line ; and the newtonian curve of the gaseous disk is shown by the dashed curve .",
    "the observed rotation curves are determined from the velocity field by the method of fitting tilted rings ( see begeman 1987 ) and interactively adjusted for beam - smearing effects given the actual position - velocity diagrams in the inner regions .",
    "the error bars are estimated by eye also from the position - velocity diagrams and probably give a more realistic indication of the possible range of rotation velocity than do the formal errors returned by ring - fitting program .",
    "as in table 1 , the asterisk indicates those systems with disturbed velocity fields .",
    "table 2 lists the fitted disk masses and errors for the sample galaxies .",
    "also shown are the implied stellar mass - to - light ratios in the blue and near infrared ( columns 4 and 5 ) , as well as the total mass - to - light ratios in the near - infrared in column 6 ( the total mass is the sum of the fitted stellar disk mass plus the observed gas mass ) . because galaxy evolution models predict a relation between the mass - to - light ratio in the various bands and the color of the stellar population , the extinction corrected b - v color is given in column 7 for those galaxies for which it has been determined ( as tabulated in the third reference catalog of de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) .    in general , the mond rotation curves agree well with the observed curves , but in some cases the agreement is less than perfect . as it turns out , in most of those cases of serious disagreement",
    "there are problems with the observed rotation curve or with its interpretation as a tracer of the radial force distribution .",
    "several of the individual cases are discussed below .",
    "ngc 3949 : verheijen ( 1997 ) notes that this rotation curve has a considerable side - to - side asymmetry : it rises more steeply on the receding side than on the approaching side , and there is a faint companion 1.5 arc min to the north which may be interacting with this galaxy .",
    "ngc 3992 : this barred system is the most luminous galaxy in the sample . although the mond rotation curve agrees well with the observed rotation curve , the required mass - to - light ratio of the stellar disk ( 2.2 in the near - infrared ) is unusually large for this sample .",
    "this is also true for the various dark halo fits to the rotation curve ( verheijen 1997 ) .",
    "ngc 4389 : this system is strongly barred , and the neutral hydrogen is not extended but contiguous with the optical image of the galaxy .",
    "verheijen ( 1997 ) points out that the velocity field can not be interpreted in terms of circular motion and that the overall kinematics is dominated by the bar .",
    "ugc 6446 : this low surface - brightness , gas - rich galaxy has an asymmetric rotation curve in the inner regions ; on the receding side it rises more steeply than on the approaching side . the mond fit is much improved if the distance to this galaxy is only 8 or 9 mpc instead of the adopted 15.5 mpc .",
    "such a possibility is consistent with the fact that this galaxy has the lowest systemic velocity in the sample : 730 km / s which is 1.5 sigma below the mean of 950 km / s .",
    "ugc 6818 : this is a dwarf galaxy which is probably interacting with a faint companion on its western edge ( verheijen 1997 )    ugc 6930 : this is the one galaxy in the sample with an inclination less than @xmath21 ( i = @xmath22 ) . it was included here because of its hydrogen richness ( @xmath23 ) and its extremely regular velocity field .",
    "ugc 6973 : verheijen ( 1997 ) notes that this galaxy is interacting with ugc 6962 to the northwest and that the hi disk is warped .",
    "moreover , there is considerable evidence for vigorous star formation in the inner region which is bright red and dusty . in the central regions",
    "this is the reddest galaxy in the sample ; in terms of central surface brightness @xmath24 ( tully et al .",
    "this suggests that the k@xmath0 band may be contaminated by dust emission and not be a true tracer of the distribution of the old stellar population .",
    "the resulting calculated newtonian rotation curve would be unrealistically declining as a result .    in a number of cases the calculated rotation curve overshoots the observed rotation curve in the inner regions ( e.g. ngc 3877 , ngc 4085 , ngc 4217 ) .",
    "these are highly inclined galaxies , and the true rotation curve could be steeper than that measured because of missing gas in the inner regions ( hi holes ) .",
    "but there is additional effect which may also be important . in calculating the newtonian force from the observed light distribution it was assumed that the stellar mass , including any possible bulge component , was distributed entirely in a thin disk .",
    "if the bulge component is spheroidal this would then lead to an over - estimate of the newtonian force in the region of the bulge , given that the m / l of the bulge is taken to be the same as that of the disk .",
    "therefore , in several cases it might be of interest to decompose the light distribution into a bulge and disk component .",
    "this would not add another fitting parameter because , in the near - infrared , m / l of the bulge and disk is probably quite similar , but it might well improve the fits in the inner regions .",
    "in addition to the usual high surface - brightness galaxies with extended rotation curves , this sample includes low and high surface - brightness galaxies with measured rotation curves which do not extend far beyond the optical disk .",
    "because of this certain general trends are noticeable .",
    "for those galaxies in which the acceleration at the last measured points of the rotation curve is comparable to @xmath11 ( e.g. , ngc 3877 , ngc 3953 , ngc 4085 ) , the discrepancy between the newtonian rotation curve and the observed rotation curve is small exactly as mond predicts . for galaxies in which the gravitational acceleration at the last measured points is small in terms of @xmath11 ( e.g. , ngc 3769 , ngc 4013 , ngc 4157 , all low surface - brightness galaxies ) , the observed discrepancy is large again exactly as mond predicts .",
    "it is interesting that in the high surface - brightness galaxies with extended rotation curves and a large discrepancy in the outer regions ( ngc 3769 , ngc 3992 ) , newton adequately explains the rotation curve in the inner regions and mond takes care of the rest .",
    "fig .  2 shows the distribution of mass - to - light ratios of the stellar disk in the near - infrared ( table 2 , column 5 ) for the total sample of 30 galaxies .",
    "the shaded histogram applies only to those 23 objects without an obvious disturbance in the velocity field ( the objects not designated by an asterisk ) .",
    "it is evident that the m / l@xmath25 is sharply peaked between 0.8 and 1.0 ; in the purified sample of 23 the mean m / l@xmath26 is 0.97 @xmath27 0.36 . excluding the most extreme case , the luminous spiral ngc 3992 ,",
    "this becomes 0.92 @xmath27 0.25 ; i.e. , there is less than 30% scatter in the fitted near - infrared m / l .    in paper 2",
    "it was pointed out that there is a rough correlation between the mond stellar mass - to - light ratio in the b - band and the asymptotic rotation velocity : the more massive galaxies have a larger @xmath28 . in fig .",
    "3 , which is a plot of @xmath28 vs. rotation velocity at the outermost measured point , this correlation is also evident for the galaxies in the present sample .",
    "the filled points are the 30 galaxies in the uma sample , and the open points are the published sample of 33 field galaxies considered in papers 1 and 2 .",
    "the values for the uma galaxies range between 0.2 and 5 and there is a clear trend with rotation velocity of the form @xmath29 .",
    "the overlapping of the two sets of points indicates the consistency of the m / l@xmath4 values here with the results for the earlier sample although the range in m / l@xmath4 and the scatter about the correlation with @xmath30 is smaller for the uma sample .",
    "more revealing is the relation between the implied stellar @xmath28 and the reddening corrected b - v color index for those 17 sample galaxies ( table 2 ) with cataloged color index data ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "this is compared again with the previous sample in fig .",
    "4 ( there are similar trends with b - r and b - k@xmath0 ) . also shown on this plot",
    "is the predicted relation between mass - to - blue light ratio and b - v color from the old galaxy evolution models of larsen and tinsley ( 1978 ) ; these predicted properties are those of a population of stars evolved for @xmath31 years with various prescriptions for a monotonically decreasing star formation rate . although modern galaxy evolution programs are more sophisticated ( e.g. worthey 1994 ) and include additional parameters such as the effect of varying metallicity , the overall trends of m /",
    "l with color are the same . here , as previously , the clear trend of increasing @xmath28 with redness matches that of the model . the evident agreement , not only in form but also in amplitude , is somewhat fortuitous but it does indicate that the implied mond @xmath28 values are astrophysically plausible and consistent with stellar population synthesis models .    it should be recalled that the mass of the stellar disk is the only free parameter in these rotation curve fits . as emphasized in paper 2 all inadequacies in the data ( dispersion in distance , deviations from circular motion , uncertainties introduced by warping or errors in inclination , the unknown contribution of molecular gas to the mass distribution , etc . )",
    "are absorbed by this one parameter . in view of this , it is quite striking that the implied mass - to - light ratios have characteristic value of about one in the near - infrared ( with small scatter ) and in the b - band a dependence with color which is understandable in terms of population synthesis models .",
    "this lends support not only to mond but also to the assumptions underlying this procedure ( such as the constancy of m / l in a single galaxy and the absence of a significant contribution to the surface density by molecular gas which is distributed differently from the stars ) .",
    "in fact , the implied constancy of @xmath32 elevates the mond fits to these rotation curves to the level of actual predictions .",
    "if one assumes a mass - to - light ratio of about 0.9 in the near - infrared , then , with modified dynamics , the rotation curve derived from the mean radial distribution of near - infrared emission , when combined with the directly observed gas distribution would be consistent , in most cases here , with the observed rotation curve to considerable precision .",
    "the same would be true if one used the measured b - v color of a galaxy to estimate @xmath28 from the larson and tinsley population synthesis models .",
    "this removes all free parameters and the rotation curve can be directly calculated from the observed distribution of matter .",
    "modified dynamics implies a mass - rotation velocity relationship for galaxies which is exact ( milgrom 1983a ) ; it is the mond equivalent of kepler s third law in the limit of low acceleration .",
    "> from eqs .",
    "2 and 3 it is evident that , as the radius becomes large , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the total mass of the galaxy the mass in gas in addition to the stellar disk ( i.e. @xmath35 ) .",
    "this then leads to an observed luminosity - rotation velocity relation ( the tully - fisher relation ) of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mean total mass - to - light ratio in the particular band .",
    "expressed as a log(l ) vs. log(v ) relation , the tully - fisher relation in a given color band predicted by mond becomes @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( assuming no systematic variation of m@xmath40/l with v ) and @xmath41 ; here @xmath37 is expressed in solar units , and we take @xmath42 as found in paper 1 .",
    "the total mass - to - near infrared luminosity ratio is given in column 6 of table 2 .",
    "here it is found that , for the total sample @xmath43 which means that @xmath44 .",
    "note that mond not only predicts the slope of the logarithmic tf relation but also the intercept .",
    "the observed tf relation in the k@xmath0 band is shown in fig .  5 where the luminosity and rotation velocity are taken directly from table 1",
    ". a least - square fit , also shown on the plot , gives @xmath45 and @xmath46 in agreement with the mond prediction .",
    "this is also consistent with a previous determination of the h - band ( 1.6 @xmath3 m ) tf relation for uma galaxies by peletier & willner ( 1993 ) who found a slope of 4.08 @xmath27 0.24 .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the tf relation can only arise from the intrinsic scatter in @xmath47 . leaving out the most extreme point , ugc 6446 ( which",
    ", as noted above , may be a foreground object ) , this is found to be 37% in agreement with the scatter in the observed k@xmath0-band tf relation .    the rotation velocity in fig .",
    "5 is that at the outer most reliable point of the rotation curve and may not correspond to the asymptotic circular velocity particularly in those galaxies where outermost centripetal accelerations are greater than @xmath11 and in the low surface - brightness galaxies with rotation curves still rising at the last point .",
    "verheijen ( 1997 ) has noted that by selecting only those galaxies in the ursa major sample in which the rotation curve has reached an asymptotically constant value , and by taking this asymptotic value for the velocity coordinate in the tf relation ( as opposed to a global profile width or the peak rotation velocity ) , the scatter in the tf relation is greatly reduced and the slope is four ( see also broeils 1992 , rhee 1996 , and mcgaugh & de blok 1998a ) .",
    "this is precisely the expectation deduced from mond where it is the constant rotation velocity at large distance from the visible galaxy which correlates exactly with mass ( eq .  4 ) .",
    "verheijen further notes that in this highly selected sub - sample of fifteen galaxies the scatter in the observed near - infrared tf relation is consistent with the observational scatter ; that is to say , no intrinsic scatter in the tf relation can be detected .",
    "this is also consistent with mond in which the mass - velocity relation is exact : the only source of intrinsic scatter is that in m@xmath40/l which , in the near - infrared , may be quite small .",
    "twelve of the galaxies in this sample are in the low surface - brightness category as defined by tully and verheijen ( 1997 ) ; these are mostly the lower luminosity objects in fig .",
    "5 although there is some overlap in luminosity with objects of high surface - brightness .",
    "it is noteworthy that these lsb galaxies lie on the same tf relation defined by the high surface - brightness galaxies .",
    "this fact , which has been noticed by zwaan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , is an inevitable aspect of mond where the tf - relation is absolute ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998b ) .",
    "dark halo models , on the other hand , require some contrived coupling of parameters to reproduce this observation ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998a ) .",
    "this sample of galaxies in the ursa major cluster combined with those of paper 2 and the low surface - brightness galaxies analyzed by mcgaugh and de blok ( 1998b ) , provide a total sample of about 80 spiral galaxies with rotation curves measured in neutral hydrogen for which the predicted mond rotation curves have been calculated . because of the systematic effects the usual statistical tests of goodness - of - fit are not entirely appropriate in accessing these rotation curve fits , but qualitatively one would say that in only five or six cases out of this 80 is the rotation curve predicted by mond from the observed distribution of light and gas noticeably different from the observed rotation curve . in the present sample , ngc 4389 and ugc 6973 should be included in this category . for these objects there is usually an obvious problem with the observed rotation curve or its use as a tracer of the radial force distribution . in others one may question the measured surface brightness distribution as a precise tracer of the stellar mass distribution ( ugc 6973 for example ) . for about 30 galaxies",
    "the mond rotation curve reproduces the general shape of the observed curve and accounts for the magnitude of the conventional mass discrepancy with a reasonable mass - to - light ratio ( ngc 3877 , 4013 , 4138 would fall in this category ) .",
    "in fully half of the objects considered , the mond rotation curve reproduces the observed curve with considerable precision ( as for ngc 4157 , ugc 6399 , 6667 , 6917 in the present sample ) .    unlike the previous samples ,",
    "the galaxies considered here are optically selected and form a complete and homogeneous sample . because selection does not depend primarily upon neutral hydrogen richness and extent",
    ", these galaxies have a wider range of properties than those in papers 1 and 2 .",
    "for example , in a number of these objects the observed rotation curve does not extend far beyond the optical disk into the regime where the discrepancy is large .",
    "this is a positive aspect of this sample because certain general predictions of mond are seen to be verified : the discrepancy between the newtonian and observed rotation curve is seen to be small in those objects with high centripetal accelerations at the last measured point of the rotation curve as mond predicts . in regions where the internal acceleration is low in the extended rotation curves of high surface - brightness galaxies as in the previous samples mond predicts the observed large discrepancy .",
    "it is noteworthy that some of the best fits are achieved for the low surface - brightness galaxies where the discrepancy is largest .",
    "this is precisely what one would expect from mond since these objects lie entirely in the low acceleration limit of the theory in the deep mond limit where there is no uncertainty arising from unknown function @xmath48 in eq .  2 ( see also mcgaugh & de blok 1998b ) .    the range of m",
    "/ l is generally reasonable and consistent , in the blue , with population synthesis models . when near - infrared photometry is available , as for this sample , there is remarkably little variation in the fitted m / l of the stellar component on the order of 30% .",
    "when one considers that this is the only free parameter in the fits and will reflect all uncertainties ( such as the real dispersion in distance ) , the results here are consistent with a effectively constant value of m / l in the near - infrared for spiral galaxies . assigning the same near - infrared",
    "m / l to all galaxies then makes the mond rotation curves true predictions , without free parameters .",
    "the predictive power of mond , at least with respect to galaxy rotation curves and the tf relation , is well - established .",
    "it has been difficult to compare this , in a fair way , with dark matter halos because , until recently , the dark halo hypotheses have had essentially no predictive power .",
    "the exercise has been one of fitting dark matter halos with an assumed density distribution to the observed rotation curve in order to estimate halo and disk parameters . with at least three free parameters available ( disk m / l , halo core radius , and density normalization ) ,",
    "essentially any observed rotation curve can be reproduced , as in the analysis of uma galaxies by verheijen ( 1997 ) .    in the last several years , this has changed due to the further development of cosmological n - body codes with large numbers of particles and high spatial resolution .",
    "it has become evident that in simulations in which the initial spectrum of density fluctuations is that of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , a characteristic form for the radial mass distribution of virialized halos arises ( dubinsky & carberg 1991 , navarro et al .",
    "1996 , cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "this characteristic form is distinguished by a singular density distribution a density which continues to increase as 1/r into the origin .",
    "this density law may be parameterized by the hernquist model ( hernquist 1990 , dubinsky & carlberg 1991 ) or by an alternative model suggested by navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which has essentially the same form in the regime where galaxy rotation curves actually measured .",
    "although these singular halos can produce acceptable fits to the rotation curves of high luminosity , high surface - brightness galaxies ( sanders and begeman 1994 ) they generally fail in low surface - brightness dwarfs ( flores & primack 1994 , moore 1994 ) . significantly , navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have demonstrated that , given the mass or velocity scaling of a halo , the degree of central concentration ( or halo length scale ) is determined by the cosmology .",
    "mcgaugh & de blok ( 1998b ) show that such constrained halos dramatically fail to reproduce the rotation curves of the low surface - brightness galaxies for plausible cosmologies ; it is impossible to match the gradual rise in the observed rotation curve in the inner region with the asymptotic velocity at larger radii ; the singular density distribution produces a rotation curve which rises far too steeply .    the predicted mass - velocity relation for the cdm halos ( not considering that the observed correlation is with the luminosity of the baryonic component ) is closer to @xmath49 ( white 1997 ) while @xmath50 for mond again a clearly distinct prediction . in this sense also , mond is successful when one considers the correlation between the asymptotic flat rotation velocity and the luminosity ( verheijen 1997 ) . therefore , on this very basic phenomenological level",
    ", one can only conclude that mond works where dark matter , at least the presently favored form of dark matter , does not .",
    "it is sometimes argued that mond is `` designed '' to fit rotation curves , so that it is no surprise that it works so well on this scale .",
    "it is true that mond , in some sense , is designed to reproduce asymptotically flat rotation curves and a tf relation of the form @xmath51 .",
    "but it by no means evident that the variety of detailed shapes of rotation curves exhibited by the total sample of 80 galaxies so far considered could be so precisely reproduced by using mond to calculate the radial force from the observed distribution of detectable matter .",
    "mond works well throughout the entire galaxy , not just where the rotation attains its asymptotic constant value , and it was in no sense designed to do this . using mond milgrom _ predicted _ that the discrepancy between the observed curve and the newtonian rotation curve should be small in regions of high surface - brightness , and that the discrepancy should be large in galaxies of low surface - brightness even before such galaxies were discovered . these predictions are clearly verified in the sample of galaxies considered here , which include both types of systems .",
    "it is this inherent simplicity and predictive power that gives the idea its continued impact in spite of the absence of a solid theoretical basis for mond .",
    "the detailed shape and amplitude of a rotation curve can be calculated from the observed distribution of detectable matter , with no free parameters by assuming a fixed value of m / l of about one in the near - infrared .",
    "what more could one expect from a theory of gravity ? because of this it is justified to claim that mond , at the present time , is epistemologically superior to the dark matter hypothesis .",
