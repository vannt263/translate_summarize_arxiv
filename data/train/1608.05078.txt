    "in almost all galactic globular clusters ( ggc ) , the abundance variations of individual elements have been reported . since the study of @xcite , the significance of the variation in c , n , and",
    "o abundances has been emphasized owing to their high abundances in chemical compositions @xcite .",
    "stellar models , in which chemical composition is adopted from observations , have been constructed for comparison studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because ` chemical anomalies ' of various other elements and anti - correlations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in ggcs have been reported @xcite , it has become more important to consider observational results . for various other elements , the effects on stars of the abundance variations have been investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , some studies suggest scenarios for explaining the general abundance pattern present in the stars of ggcs , including chemical compositions with positive variations in c , n , na , negative variations in o @xcite , and positive variations in al and negative variations in mg content @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]                  , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 mixtures .",
    "the colored lines represent the 12 gyr isochrones of the different mixtures as indicated in the legend .",
    "the order of the mixture in the legend was chosen according to the shift of the isochrones with respect to the reference isochrone .",
    "upward along the rgb , the isochrones of @xmath4 and @xmath5 approach the reference isochrones , which means that the influence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 decreases more than that of the other elements as the effective temperature decreases . ]        to express the abundance variation of various elements in the same parameter domain , the chosen parameter is the relative change in particle number with respect to the reference mixture . because its value is relative to the reference mixture , this parameter is independent of the total metallicity .",
    "for example , when the parameter is + 0.3 , the total number of metal ions in the comparison model is enhanced by @xmath6 over that in the reference model .",
    "the parameter is presented as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the abundance in number for all metal elements , and the subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 indicate the stellar models before and after the modification , respectively .",
    "the parameter can be calculated in the following equation with variation in dex and the number fraction in the reference mixture : @xmath11 } - 1 ) \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : cal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a target element having a change in abundance , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 $ ] are the number fraction in the reference mixture and the variation in @xmath15 , respectively ; the other variables are the same as those in equation  ( [ eq : def ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameter for the cases in this work are summarized in table [ tbl5 ] . when the abundance change is expressed with the parameter",
    ", the degree of the shape change of the isochrones appears to be linearly related to the abundance variation .",
    "the impact of abundance variation in na , mg , and al contents is shown in figure [ len_sgb_namgal ] .",
    "the figure presents the difference in sub - gb length for three different metallicities in terms of the abundance variation , which was introduced in the previous section . in the figure",
    ", the points appear to form a straight line .",
    "this indicates that the changes in isochrone shape are linearly correlated with the relative changes in the number of metal ions regardless of the choice of element among na , mg , or al .",
    "that is , when the number variations are the same , the isochrones for the three elements have similar shapes .",
    "the same is true for the shifts of ms and rgb , which is discussed further in the following subsection .",
    "this correlation can be described as behavior that the three elements affect similarly in stellar interior models .",
    "the abundance change for these elements affects the interior models mainly through the opacity .",
    "as reported by @xcite , the abundance change of these elements increases the opacity in the similar temperature ranges of the stellar interior .",
    "these elements have similar atomic structures ; therefore , their ionization potential is similar , and they donate a similar number of electrons in a certain physical condition .",
    "therefore , the opacity is similarly changed when the abundance changes of these elements are the same . the effect on the energy generation , however , is very limited . unlike c ,",
    "n , and o , the impact of the elements on the energy generation is through only changes of the physical condition associated with the structural changes .",
    "it is widely accepted that c , n , and o have similar roles and influence in a star and that the degree of the effects depends on @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "figure [ len_sgb_cno ] is the same as figure [ len_sgb_namgal ] except for the elements .",
    "as expected , a linear relation can be detected in each panel even though the linearity appears to be weaker in figure 4 .",
    "this may have occurred because these elements are related to nucleosynthesis as well as opacity , whereas the group of na , mg , and al is directly related only to opacity .",
    "figure [ l_msto_cno ] plots the shifts of msto in both effective temperature ( upper panels ) and brightness ( lower panels ) . in all panels , a linear relation can be found .",
    "this again means that the degree of the net effect is the same when the number of the target element is changed by the same amount regardless of which element is chosen among c , n , and o.    in summary , it appears that the na , mg , and al can be considered as one group .",
    "similar to @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 $ ] determines the degree of the effect on stellar models .",
    "therefore , no significant change can be expected in stars in which the sum of na , mg and al contents is not significantly changed .",
    "for example , in stars of the agb phase the @xmath18 reaction reduces the mg and increases the al contents .",
    "thus , next - generation stars polluted by the winds from agb stars show @xmath18 anti - correlation .",
    "because the sum of mg and al contents is not significantly changed , however , the effect associated with the abundance variation in these contents may be very limited .",
    "in this section , we focus on the characteristics of fe and si that distinguish them from the other elements considered in this work .",
    "it is considered that si and fe generally behave in a manner similar to other metals , especially mg , in stellar models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , si has been considered to be similar to mg owing to their roles in stellar models and their high abundance .",
    "however , @xcite reported that the influence of si on opacity becomes smaller than that of mg at low temperatures . in the present study , the effect of fe , as well as si ,",
    "was shown to be lower than that of other metals at low temperatures .",
    "in addition , the influence of fe is much larger than those of na , mg , al , and even si .    in high - metallicity conditions , the influence of fe as well as si decrease near the rgb tip where effective temperature is lower .",
    "figure [ sife1 ] shows the rgb of the 12 gyr isochrones with @xmath19 = 0.866 $ ] . in the right panel , unlike others , the isochrones of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are inclined toward the reference isochrone as they approach the rgb tip .",
    "the same is shown in figure [ l_rgb_nafe ] , which also shows the location differences of the rgbs with respect to the abundance variation .",
    "the four columns of the panels represent the four different values of metallicity , and the three rows represent cases with different locations of rgb shift measurement . in the left panels of the figure ,",
    "the points of si and fe are located near the line formed by the points of na , mg , and al . in the upper and right panels , however , which represent the shift of rgb measured at the brighter points along rgb in addition to higher metallicity",
    ", the two points appear not to be associated with the linear relation formed by the other points . for the abundance variations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ,",
    "the shift of rgb was expected to be increased with the points located farther below .",
    "the fact that this did not occur can be interpreted as the lesser influence of si and fe in stars with low effective temperature , i.e. , for higher metallicity and positions closer to the rgb tip .",
    "furthermore , this effect is stronger for si than fe .",
    "the influence of each element on opacity differs in various temperature and density according to its atomic structure .",
    "thus , it is expected that the influence of na , mg , and al might differ from each other only in cases with higher metallicity .",
    "however , the metallicity is beyond the usual metallicity range of globular clusters in our galaxy ( above about @xmath19 = -0.5 $ ] ) . in comparison ,",
    "the reduced influence of si and fe can be seen in the rgb stars of a metal - rich cluster above @xmath19 = -1.0 $ ] .",
    "the influence of fe near the msto is greater than that of na , mg , al , and even si . figure [ l_msto_nafe ] shows the shift of the msto as a function of the abundance variation .",
    "the point of @xmath21 is located far below the line formed by other points .",
    "this indicates that more changes of the msto location than that of the other elements is expacted when the degree of the abundance variation is the same .",
    "although the abundance variation of @xmath21 is similar to that of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the msto of the isochrone shift of @xmath21 is twice that of the others . on the contrary , the point of @xmath20 appears to be on the line formed by the points of the cases for na , mg , and al . in the inner part of a stellar model ,",
    "the opacity peak associated with fe is at a different temperature range from that of the other elements ; the opacity peaks of na , mg , al , and si occur almost in the same region @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are shown in figure [ len_sgb_nafe ] , which is the same as figure [ len_sgb_namgal ] except for the addition of fe and si cases . in all panels of the figure",
    ", the points of @xmath24 and @xmath20 do not appear to be associated with the linear relation of na , mg , and al .",
    "the length of the sub - gb for @xmath24 and @xmath20 is modified less because of the lower influence of fe and si on the rgb .",
    "additionally , @xmath24 shows a significant shift of the msto , which is in the same direction as the rgb ; thus , the change in the length of the sub - gb is less than that in other cases .",
    "the first subsection discusses abundance variations of less abundant metals .",
    "the previous results show that their extreme variations can cause considerable change in isochrone shape . the lower limits of abundance variations are discussed based on the abundance variations and associated shape changes in the isochrone .",
    "furthermore , the results of the section 4 indicate that the two parameters , specifically @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 $ ] are key parameters in stars whose mixtures have @xmath0 and @xmath1 anti - correlations .",
    "thus , the last subsection discusses the implication of the new group of na , mg , and al in evolutionary point of view .      to determine the limiting value in the abundance variation that causes noticeable changes in the isochrones , the length of the sub - gb was investigated .",
    "it was assumed that the typical error of the age estimation utilizing the length of the sub - gb for a globular cluster is about @xmath25 @xcite . for c and n , the enhancement of about @xmath26 in @xmath27 $ ] or about @xmath28 in @xmath29 $ ] cause a noticeable increase in the age estimation .",
    "because of their low abundances in the reference mixture , however , any amount of depletion in the abundance of these elements can not produce isochrones that resemble those that are @xmath25 younger .",
    "conversely , both enhancement and depletion are attainable for o.    for na and al , this factor depends on the metallicity .",
    "metallicity lower than @xmath19 = -1.0 $ ] , @xmath30 = 1.3~dex$ ] and above produce an isochrone appearing @xmath25 younger , which corresponds with the enhancements of @xmath31 = + 1.0 $ ] with respect to the reference mixture . for al , the value is @xmath32 = 1.2~dex$ ] and above , which is the same as @xmath33 = + 1.5 $ ] with respect to reference mixture . for a metallicity higher than @xmath19 = -1.0",
    "$ ] , the value is about @xmath30 = 1.1~dex$ ] and above , which corresponds to @xmath31 = + 0.8 $ ] .",
    "and the value is @xmath32 = 0.9~dex$ ] and above , which is @xmath33 = + 1.2 $ ] .",
    "because of the low abundance an isochrone resembling @xmath25 older can not be generated by any amount of depletion in na and al contents . for mg , however , both enhancement and depletion may be considered .    as discussed in section 4.3 , for elements in a group ,",
    "the variation in the total sum rather than in individual variations is an important parameter . for @xmath34",
    "$ ] , an abundance variation of about @xmath34^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$ ] and greater can produce recognizable changes in age estimation .",
    "depending on metallicity , the variations beyond @xmath35^{+0.20}_{-0.35}$ ] in the lower metallicity of @xmath19 = -1.0 $ ] and @xmath35^{+0.11}_{-0.14}$ ] in the higher metallicity of @xmath19 = -1.0 $ ] are considerable .      the fact that na , mg , and al can be considered as a group , such as the case of @xmath36 , has an important implication on the studies of the ggcs that show @xmath0 and @xmath1 anti - correlations .",
    "according to the anti - correlations , the contents of c and n of second - generation stars is enhanced , whereas that of o is depleted .",
    "similarly , the abundance variation of na and al is opposite that of mg . when the changes in the content of an individual element in a group cancel out , the resulting effect may be less than expected otherwise .",
    "for example , some second - generation stars have a mixture enhanced by @xmath37 of na and @xmath28 of al and depleted by 0.3 mg @xcite .",
    "the total abundance change is -0.0008 in @xmath38 and -0.010 in terms of @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "therefore , no significant change is expected in the shape of its isochrone .",
    "this expectation , similar to that reported by @xcite , can serve as an example of the case mentioned in the last part of section 4.3 .",
    "for the case of @xcite , second - generation stars have a mixture of 0.6 dex increase of c , @xmath39 increase of n , and @xmath37 decrease of o. the actual changes in total are 2.24 in @xmath38 and 0.585 in @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "because of the huge increase in n , the total variation is very large even after some cancellation .",
    "therefore , the isochrones for these second - generation stars differ significantly from those for first - generation stars .    for an isochrone shape on the theoretical hrd",
    ", o is commonly taken as the representative among @xmath36 because it is the most abundant element .",
    "similarly , mg can represent na , mg , and al .",
    "thus , instead of all six elements of c , n , o , na , mg , and al , only two elements of o and mg need to be considered .",
    "for the first example , the isochrone for @xmath40 = -0.010 $ ] is the same as that with variations in the content of all three elements ; the case of @xmath41 = 0.674 $ ] is the same as that in the second example .",
    "the abundance variations of individual elements have been reported in stars of ggcs ; their effects on stellar evolution and isochrones have been investigated for extreme cases . in this study ,",
    "stellar models and isochrones were constructed with mass and metallicity ranges for ggcs of @xmath19 = -2.173 \\sim -0.375 $ ] ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 .    in the analysis of its effect of an individual element ,",
    "the changes in the total number of metal ions introduced by the abundance variation is shown to be a key parameter .",
    "the changes of the isochrone shape is expressed in terms of the change in the total number of metal ions .",
    "analysis of the isochrones for various elements revealed that a few elements have similar roles in stellar models .",
    "in particular , na , mg , and al can be considered as one group as in the case of c , n , and o. therefore , the abundance variations can be considered as variations of @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] .    the influence of si and fe on the ms and rgb differed from those of na , al , and mg . specifically , the influence of si and fe on the rgb became smaller than that of na , mg , and al in a star with low effective temperature .",
    "thus , the influence of si and fe decreases as the metallicity increases and in points ascending along the rgb .",
    "additionally , the influence of fe on the ms is larger than that of na , mg , al , and even si .    to produce noticeable change in isochrones , the variation in the content of elements should be larger than certain values . depending on the metallicity ,",
    "these values are about @xmath30 = 1.1~dex$ ] or more , @xmath32 = 0.9~dex$ ] or more with the enhancements of about @xmath26 in @xmath27 $ ] , and about @xmath28 in @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "this can also be presented as @xmath34^{+0.15}_{-0.20}$ ] and @xmath35^{+0.11}_{-0.14}$ ] .    according to the general abundance pattern of second - generation stars , the abundances of the relatively less abundant elements such as c ,",
    "n , na , and al were highly enhanced while those of the abundant elements such as o and mg were depleted ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , because na , mg , and al can be considered as a single group similar to the case of c , n , and o , the abundance sum of @xmath44 can also be utilized in the studies examining the effect caused by their abundance variation in stellar models .",
