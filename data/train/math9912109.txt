    "mirror symmetry was discovered some time ago by string theorists as an equivalence between two physical theories associated to pairs of families of calabi  yau manifolds . the best known manifestation of the phenomenon consisted in the predictions made by a group of physicists @xcite about the number of rational curves on calabi  yau manifolds . in 1993 , witten @xcite introduced the gauged linear sigma model and studied the different realizations of the physical theory , which he referred to as _ phase transitions _ in the theory .",
    "more detailed investigations of the mechanism through which mirror symmetry identifies the parameter spaces corresponding to the two sides of the story ( the khler moduli and the complex moduli , respectively ) were pursued by aspinwall , greene and morrison @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in his icm 1994 presentation @xcite ,",
    "kontsevich proposed _ the homological mirror symmetry conjecture _ as a new mathematical interpretation of mirror symmetry through an equivalence between `` fukaya s @xmath3 category '' of a calabi  yau manifold @xmath0 and the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves @xmath4 of the mirror calabi  yau manifold @xmath1 although in the general calabi ",
    "yau case , fukaya s category remains quite elusive , in a 1996 lecture , kontsevich @xcite indicated how his proposal implies that the groups of automorphisms of the two types of categories should also be identified under mirror symmetry .",
    "our focus is not on the categories themselves , but rather on the identification of their automorphisms groups in the case when the mirror calabi  yau varieties @xmath0 and @xmath5 are complete intersections in toric varieties .",
    "the braid group actions on derived categories of coherent sheaves and their conjectural mirror symmetric relationship with the symplectic generalized dehn twists of seidel @xcite have been analyzed recently by seidel and thomas @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main results of the present work describe the correspondence between the automorphisms groups in the 1-parameter and some 2-parameter cases , as well as a geometric construction of complexes in @xmath6 whose induced actions on @xmath7 match the monodromy action on @xmath8 provided by the actions of loops around the various components of the discriminant locus in the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath0 ( in the general case ) .",
    "the construction establishes an explicit realization in the toric case of the program presented by kontsevich in his lecture @xcite .",
    "our method uses tools developed in the `` early '' days of mirror symmetry , such as the machinery of gelfand  kapranov  zelevinsky hypergeometric systems @xcite , @xcite and the description of the phase transitions in type ii string theory obtained by witten @xcite , and aspinwall , greene and morrison @xcite .",
    "their investigation offers a detailed picture of how the variations of the complexified khler class on @xmath5 ( inducing , in particular , different birational models , or `` phases '' , of @xmath5 ) are identified with the variations of complex structures on @xmath9 as a consequence of the relative simple structure of the ( special ) lagrangian submanifolds in the elliptic curve and k@xmath10 surface situations , several authors were able to prove special cases of kontsevich s conjectures ( see @xcite for the case of elliptic curves , and @xcite for the case of k@xmath10 surfaces ) .",
    "the string theoretic origins of the equivalence require that the calabi ",
    "yau structure on a manifold @xmath11 should be parametrized by a choice of a complex structure with trivial canonical bundle , a khler form @xmath12 and an element @xmath13 in @xmath14 ( the so - called b - field ) .",
    "the complexified khler form is then defined to be @xmath15 . according to yau s solution of the calabi conjecture , the complex structure and the khler form determine uniquely a ricci - flat metric .",
    "it has long been stated by string theorists that the mirror manifolds @xmath5 and @xmath0 are just different manifestations of the same physical theory .",
    "the automorphisms of the two types of categories studied in this work provide a way of comparing the effects on the physical theory of the variations of the different parts of the parameter spaces of mirror calabi  yau structures .    starting with the work of mukai @xcite ,",
    "the actions of functors on derived categories of coherent sheaves have received much attention . under some additional assumptions , bondal and",
    "orlov @xcite and orlov @xcite showed that for a smooth projective variety @xmath5 any automorphism of @xmath4 is given by an object @xmath16 in @xmath6 .",
    "for every such object , an automorphism functor of @xmath4 is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are projections on the first and second factor , respectively , and the functors involved are the corresponding right and left derived functors . due to the analogy with integral operators , @xmath16 is called a `` kernel '' and the transformation is known as a `` fourier  mukai functor '' . by considering the induced action on chern characters of coherent sheaves , these equivalences define a group @xmath20 of automorphisms of the cohomology of @xmath1 on the other hand , since the objects of fukaya s category are lagrangian submanifolds of @xmath0 endowed with unitary local systems , some natural automorphisms of the category should come from symplectomorphisms of the manifold @xmath9 in particular , any loop in the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath0 should define such an equivalence .",
    "the induced action on @xmath21 determines a group @xmath22 of automorphisms of the cohomology of @xmath9    we now state a version of the conjecture presented by kontsevich in his lecture @xcite .",
    "the actions of the groups @xmath20 and @xmath22 on the cohomologies of mirror calabi ",
    "yau manifolds @xmath5 and @xmath0 are interchanged under mirror symmetry . in particular , the loops in the moduli space of complex structures of @xmath0 are identified with kernels in @xmath23 [ conj : kont ]    among other very interesting considerations , kontsevich supported this conjecture with an explicit calculation for the 1-parameter case , in particular for the quintic threefold and its mirror ; we reproduce that calculation in section [ chap:1par ] .    although the conjecture is not toric in nature , we need toric methods to be able to explicitly compute the action of the monodromy representation .",
    "in fact , in chapter [ chap:4 ] we state a refinement of kontsevich s proposal ( conjecture [ newconj ] ) specific to the case of calabi - yau complete intersections in toric varieties .",
    "we now review the plan of this work .",
    "the required concepts are reviewed in chapter [ chap : gengen ] .",
    "the exposition is an adaptation for the present purposes of the vast literature available in the field .",
    "the analytic continuation computations are performed in chapter [ chap : mon ] .",
    "theorem [ gensol ] and corollary [ cor : contform ] present a recursive construction of the solutions to the picard  fuchs system associated with the periods of the mirror calabi ",
    "yau manifold @xmath9 the results provide an integral representation that captures the complete set of solutions to the picard  fuchs system around _ any _ toric boundary point in the moduli space of complex structures of @xmath0 ( previous results @xcite , @xcite contain explicit power series representations around a maximal unipotent point in the moduli space of complex structures ) .",
    "the analytic continuation is achieved essentially by using the classical mellin ",
    "barnes integral representations method for the gelfand ",
    "zelevinsky hypergeometric series .",
    "the content of theorem [ thm : mon ] is a monodromy formula for a particular type of loop @xmath24 ( previously studied by aspinwall , greene and morrison in @xcite ) corresponding to an edge @xmath25 in the secondary polytope of gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky @xcite associated to the toric situation .    in chapter [ chap:4 ] ,",
    "the explicit analytic computations of the monodromy representation are compared with the algebro - geometric calculations of the cohomology actions of kernels . the complete identification between kernels in @xmath6 and loops in the moduli space of complex structures on @xmath0",
    "is established in theorem [ thm:1par ] for the 1-parameter case of smooth calabi ",
    "yau complete intersections in weighted projective spaces , and in theorem [ thm:2par ] for some 2-parameter cases generalizing examples extensively studied in the physics literature ( study begun in @xcite ) .",
    "a particularly interesting case is the automorphism of @xmath4 corresponding to a phase transition from the smooth calabi ",
    "yau variety @xmath5 to an `` adjacent phase '' .",
    "such a phase transition corresponds to some edge @xmath25 in the secondary polytope associated to the toric context ( an example of this situation is provided by a birational transformation of @xmath5 ) .",

    "we also show how the phase transitions induced by edges in the secondary polytope are naturally associated to elementary contractions of the ambient toric variety ( described by reid in @xcite ) in the sense of mori theory . the toric transition from @xmath11 to the `` adjacent '' toric phase @xmath27",

    "a proof of the more general toric proposal ( conjecture [ newconj ] ) identifying the kernel corresponding to any face of the secondary polytope requires an extension of the monodromy calculation of theorem [ thm : mon ] .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that a general formula of this type would involve the use of multiple mellin ",
    "barnes integral representations , but the analytical details of such an approach seem to be quite intricate .    after the advent of d - branes in string theory , strominger , yau and zaslow @xcite proposed in 1996 a geometrical mirror symmetry construction . in their interpretation ,",
    "mirror symmetry is described by means of compactifications of toroidal special lagrangian submanifolds ( see also @xcite , @xcite for further investigations of this conjecture ) .",
    "although the interplay between the different points of view is not yet clarified , an appropriate interpretation of the results of this work offers some clues about the strominger , yau and zaslow geometrical mirror symmetry conjecture .",
