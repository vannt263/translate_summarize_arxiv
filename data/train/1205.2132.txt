    "glass can be formed in a variety of molecular and colloidal systems , but the nature of the glass transition remains elusive despite intensive research  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly observed that time scales , such as structural relaxation time , dramatically increase on the approach to the glass transition point with little change in the static structure of the liquid .",
    "this is the reason why the research on the glass transition for a long time has been focused on time scales much more than length scales . in the past decade , however , both experiments and simulations have revealed that the relaxation process not only drastically slows down but also becomes progressively more heterogeneous as a liquid approaches its glass transition point  @xcite .",
    "the collective nature of the dynamics of the supercooled liquids can indeed date back to the seminal idea of adam and gibbs  @xcite and has been well reviewed in recent publications  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of growing dynamic heterogeneity approaching the glass transition point also suggests the existence of a growing dynamic length scale in glass - forming systems  @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the issue of characteristic length scales has become one of the main themes of the study on the glass transition  @xcite .",
    "to further understand the origin of the dynamic heterogeneity and explore whether there exist structural signatures connected to the slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity in viscous liquids , several ideas have been put forward .",
    "one of the ideas is based on the effect of frustration on crystallization in vitrification . to continuously control frustration ,",
    "several ways are frequently used in the study  @xcite .",
    "one way is to focus on the polydisperse colloidal liquid where frustration can be continuously changed by varying polydispersity  @xcite ( as inspired by the study of crystal nucleation on polydisperse colloids  @xcite ) and another way is to study liquids in negatively curved space where frustration can be controlled by varying space curvature  @xcite ( as motivated from the frustration - based approach of the glass transition  @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "if the frustration is not very strong , some local order reminiscent of the crystal structure can develop with increasing density or decreasing temperature .",
    "then , one can readily detect some static correlations ( usually by bond - orientation correlation functions ) approaching the glass transition and investigate whether these structural signatures are connected to the dynamical properties .",
    "although different interpretations were given for the change of correlation length scales approaching the glass transition point  @xcite , the structural signature of slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity does exist at least in these model glass - forming liquids .",
    "in particular , a direct relation between dynamic heterogeneity and the so - called medium - range crystalline order ( mrco , i.e. , long - lived clusters of particles with high structural order ) has been revealed in colloidal dispersions  @xcite .",
    "another more general method to detect the nontrivial static spatial correlations has been proposed recently , which is motivated from the random first order transition ( rfot ) theory  @xcite ( see recent reviews  @xcite for details on this theory ) . within this theory , the so - called point - to - set correlations  @xcite",
    "are believed to capture nontrivial structures of viscous liquids .",
    "the idea is to first freeze the position of a set of particles in an equilibrium configuration and then let the system evolve in the presence of the constraint and measure how the position of the remaining particles is affected .",
    "thus , the point - to - set length is a measure of the spatial extent over which the effect of equilibrium amorphous boundary conditions propagates .",
    "numerical simulations have confirmed qualitatively the growth of the point - to - set correlations  @xcite and its connection to the dynamic correlations has also been explored recently  @xcite . besides , the structural features of slow dynamics in viscous liquids have also been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in recent years , the study of supercooled liquids and glasses under nonequilibrium conditions ( e.g. , under shear ) has also attracted considerable attention , with emphasis on their rheological properties and the establishment of the concept of effective temperature  @xcite .",
    "the rheology of soft glassy materials not only provide new insight into the nature of the glass transition but also has its own value .",
    "one common observation is the marked shear - thinning behavior in glass - forming liquids . in particular , the shear viscosity @xmath5 is found to decrease with increasing the shear rate @xmath6 as @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "another intriguing finding is that soft glassy materials commonly display the shear banding phenomenon  @xcite , i.e. , a system under strong shear spontaneously `` phase separates '' between a flowing region supporting the shear and an immobile region with no flow .",
    "recently , the question of how dynamic heterogeneity is influenced by the flow has also been addressed  @xcite , e.g. , numerical simulations  @xcite revealed the existence of large scale heterogeneities under shear flow and its connection to the non - newtonian behavior of a supercooled liquid has also been explored , and power - law dependence of the intensity of the dynamic heterogeneity on shear rate has been observed  @xcite . however , it is still not clear how dynamic heterogeneity , mrco and the associated length scales respond to shear .",
    "in this work , we focus on slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity of a colloidal glass - forming liquid and their structural features in both quiescent and sheared conditions .",
    "we use a weakly frustrated two - dimensional ( 2d ) liquid as our model system , where crystallization can be avoided and locally preferred order is allowed to develop with increasing density .",
    "the four - point density correlations and bond - orientation correlations , which have been frequently used to capture the dynamic and static length scales @xmath0 in a quiescent condition , can be readily extended to a system under steady shear in this case .",
    "we confirmed the previous findings in the absence of shear that slow dynamics accompanies the development of dynamic heterogeneity . both dynamic and static length scales increase with @xmath1-relaxation time @xmath2 as power - law @xmath3 with @xmath4 . in the presence of shear , both @xmath5 and @xmath2 have power - law dependence on @xmath6 in the marked shear thinning regime .",
    "however , dependence of the dynamic and static correlation lengths on @xmath6 can not be described by power laws in the same regime .",
    "we further find that the relation @xmath3 between length scales and dynamics holds for not too strong shear where thermal fluctuations and applied forces are both important in determining the properties of dense liquids .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we show the model and methods used in this study , and then we present results and discuss structural signatures of slows dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity in the absence of shear in sec .",
    "results under steady shear are given in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v summarizes our results .",
    "the model we focus here is a 2d liquid , in which the particles interact via the weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential  @xcite : @xmath9 , & \\text{for $ r<2^{1/6}\\sigma_{jk}$}\\\\ 0 , & \\text{otherwise , } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the depth of the potential well , @xmath11 is the distance between two particles , and @xmath12 with @xmath13 the diameter of particle @xmath14 .",
    "as the wca potential is short - ranged repulsive , a wca liquid at low temperatures behaves as a colloidal liquid .",
    "although recent simulations  @xcite have shown that the longer - ranged attractive interactions can affect the dynamics of viscous liquids in quantitatively and qualitatively ways , we expect that the conclusions in our work will not be changed since the purely repulsive model can also capture the essential features of a typical glass - forming liquid . to introduce weak frustration on crystallization in vitrification , the particle diameters were chosen equidistantly from the range @xmath15 with an interval of @xmath16 , then the polydispersity for the system is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the average of variable @xmath19 among all the particles .",
    "such polydispersity can avoid crystallization in the system and allow static structural order to develop with increasing density . in principle , brownian dynamics simulation is a more faithful method to study colloids .",
    "however , previous work has suggested that at long times , when particles have collided many times , brownian and newtonian systems show qualitatively the same phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "we employed molecular dynamics simulation in the @xmath20 ensemble , where newton s equations of motion were integrated for @xmath21 particles with the velocity form of the verlet algorithm under periodic boundary conditions and the temperature @xmath22 was maintained by the nos - hoover thermostat  @xcite .",

    "the solid lines indicate that the weak @xmath33-dependence of @xmath103 at high shear rates crosses into the strong @xmath33-dependence of @xmath103 ( olive line : @xmath155 $ ] ) at low shear rates.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]     and @xmath103 versus @xmath2 at varying @xmath6 .",
    "the lines are the same as those in fig .",

    "we find that only weak changes display in the radial distribution function ( fig .",
    "15(a ) ) , while pronounced changes are observed in the bond - orientation correlation function ( fig .",
    "@xmath101 under shear can also be well fitted by the oz function and then we can calculate the static correlation length @xmath103 under shear , which is shown in fig . 16 .",
    "clearly , power laws also fail to describe @xmath6 dependence of @xmath103 .",
    "we also confirm that @xmath93 and @xmath103 under shear have similar dependence on @xmath6 although we did nt find an empirical or theoretical functional form for them .",

    "17 , where we present log - log plot of @xmath93 and @xmath103 versus @xmath2 at varying @xmath6 .",
    "as can be seen , the power - law relation @xmath3 only breaks down for very strong shear ( @xmath156 ) , where externally applied forces overwhelm random thermal forces and the system exhibit behavior like a normal liquid ( e.g. , the relaxation process becomes fast and only weak dynamic heterogeneity displays under very strong shear , see fig .",
    "11 ) . however , the relation @xmath3 between @xmath93 , @xmath103 and @xmath2 retains for @xmath157 , where both thermal fluctuations and applied forces are important in determining properties of the liquids and the dynamics slows down and accompanies strong dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "therefore , structure features for the slow dynamics can indeed exist even under shear flow .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated structural features of slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity in a 2d polydisperse glass - forming liquid in both quiescent and sheared conditions .",
    "we have confirmed the previous findings in the absence of shear that slow dynamics accompanies the development of dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "the correlation length scales @xmath0 grow with @xmath2 as a power - law @xmath3 . in the presence of shear ,",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath2 have power - law dependence on @xmath6 in the marked shear thinning regime and exhibit weak @xmath33-dependence at high shear rates and strong @xmath33-dependence at low shear rates .",
    "the dynamic and static correlation lengths also decrease with increasing @xmath6 , but their dependence on @xmath6 can not be described by power laws in the same @xmath6 regime .",
    "we further find that the relation @xmath3 between length scales and dynamics holds for not too strong shear where thermal fluctuations and external forces are both important in determining the properties of dense liquids .",
    "therefore , our results demonstrate a link between slow dynamics and structure in glass - forming liquids even under nonequilibrium conditions and can help to better understand the non - newtonian behavior of supercooled liquids and glasses .",
