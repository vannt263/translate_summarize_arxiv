    "the last couple of decades have been the golden age for cosmology , in much the same way as the mid-1900 s were a golden age for particle physics .",
    "data of exquisite quality confirmed the broad paradigm of standard cosmology and helped us to determine the composition of the universe .",
    "as a direct consequence , the cosmological observations have thrusted upon us a rather preposterous composition for the universe which defies any simple explanation , thereby posing the greatest challenge theoretical physics has ever faced .    to understand these exciting developments , it is best to begin by reminding ourselves of the standard paradigm for cosmology .",
    "observations show that the universe is fairly homogeneous and isotropic at scales larger than about @xmath0 mpc , where 1 mpc@xmath1 cm is a convenient unit for extragalactic astronomy and @xmath2 characterizes @xcite the current rate of expansion of the universe in dimensionless form .",
    "( the mean distance between galaxies is about 1 mpc while the size of the visible universe is about @xmath3 mpc . ) the conventional  and highly successful  approach to cosmology separates the study of large scale ( @xmath4 mpc ) dynamics of the universe from the issue of structure formation at smaller scales .",
    "the former is modeled by a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of energy density ; the latter issue is addressed in terms of gravitational instability which will amplify the small perturbations in the energy density , leading to the formation of structures like galaxies .",
    "in such an approach , the expansion of the background universe is described by a single function of time @xmath5 which is governed by the equations ( with @xmath6 ) : @xmath7 the first one relates expansion rate to the energy density @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a parameter which characterizes the spatial curvature of the universe .",
    "the second equation , when coupled with the equation of state @xmath10 , determines the evolution of energy density @xmath11 in terms of the expansion factor of the universe . in particular if @xmath12 with ( at least , approximately ) constant @xmath13 then , @xmath14 and ( if we assume @xmath15 ) , @xmath16}$ ] .",
    "it is convenient to measure the energy densities of different components in terms of a _",
    "critical energy density _ ( @xmath17 ) required to make @xmath15 at the present epoch .",
    "( of course , since @xmath18 is a constant , it will remain zero at all epochs if it is zero at any given moment of time . ) from eq.([frw ] ) , it is clear that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the rate of expansion of the universe at present . the variables @xmath21 will give the fractional contribution of different components of the universe ( @xmath22 denoting baryons , dark matter , radiation , etc .",
    ") to the critical density .",
    "observations then lead to the following results :    * our universe has @xmath23 .",
    "the value of @xmath24 can be determined from the angular anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) ( with the reasonable assumption that @xmath25 ) and these observations now show that we live in a universe with critical density @xcite .",
    "* observations of primordial deuterium produced in big bang nucleosynthesis ( which took place when the universe was about 1 minute in age ) as well as the cmbr observations show that @xcite the _ total _ amount of baryons in the universe contributes about @xmath26 .",
    "given the independent observations on the hubble constant @xcite which fix @xmath27 , we conclude that @xmath28 .",
    "these observations take into account all baryons which exist in the universe today irrespective of whether they are luminous or not .",
    "combined with previous item we conclude that most of the universe is non - baryonic .",
    "* host of observations related to large scale structure and dynamics ( rotation curves of galaxies , estimate of cluster masses , gravitational lensing , galaxy surveys .. ) all suggest @xcite that the universe is populated by a non - luminous component of matter ( dark matter ; dm hereafter ) made of weakly interacting massive particles which _ does _ cluster at galactic scales .",
    "this component contributes about @xmath29 . * combining the last observation with the first we conclude that there must be ( at least ) one more component to the energy density of the universe contributing about 70% of critical density",
    ". early analysis of several observations @xcite indicated that this component is unclustered and has negative pressure .",
    "this is confirmed dramatically by the supernova observations ( see @xcite ; for a critical look at the data , see @xcite ) .",
    "the observations suggest that the missing component has @xmath30 and contributes @xmath31 . *",
    "the universe also contains radiation contributing an energy density @xmath32 today most of which is due to photons in the cmbr .",
    "this is dynamically irrelevant today but would have been the dominant component in the universe at redshifts larger that @xmath33 . *",
    "together we conclude that our universe has ( approximately ) @xmath34 .",
    "all known observations are consistent with such an  admittedly weird  composition for the universe .    before discussing the composition of the universe in greater detail ,",
    "let us briefly consider the issue of structure formation .",
    "the key idea is that if there existed small fluctuations in the energy density in the early universe , then gravitational instability can amplify them in a well - understood manner ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to structures like galaxies etc . today .",
    "the most popular theoretical model for these fluctuations is based on the idea that if the very early universe went through an inflationary phase @xcite , then the quantum fluctuations of the field driving the inflation can lead to energy density fluctuations@xcite .",
    "it is possible to construct models of inflation such that these fluctuations are described by a gaussian random field and are characterized by a power spectrum of the form @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the models can not predict the value of the amplitude @xmath37 in an unambiguous manner but it can be determined from cmbr observations .",
    "the cmbr observations are consistent with the inflationary model for the generation of perturbations and gives @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( the first results were from cobe @xcite and wmap @xcite has reconfirmed them with far greater accuracy ) .",
    "so , to the zeroth order , the universe is characterized by just seven numbers : @xmath2 describing the current rate of expansion ; @xmath34 giving the composition of the universe ; the amplitude @xmath38 and the index @xmath36 of the initial perturbations .",
    "the challenge is to make some sense out of these numbers from a more fundamental point of view .",
    "it is rather frustrating that we have no direct laboratory evidence for nearly 96% of matter in the universe .",
    "( actually , since we do not quite understand the process of baryogenesis , we do not understand @xmath40 either ; all we can _ theoretically _ understand now is a universe filled entirely with radiation ! ) .",
    "assuming that particle physics models will eventually come of age and ( i ) explain @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( probably as the lightest supersymmetric partner ) as well as ( ii ) provide a viable model for inflation predicting correct value for @xmath37 , one is left with the problem of understanding @xmath42 . while the issues ( i ) and ( ii ) are by no means trivial or satisfactorily addressed , it is probably correct to say that the issue of dark energy is lot more perplexing , thereby justifying the attention it has received recently .",
    "the key observational feature of dark energy is that  treated as a fluid with a stress tensor @xmath43  it has an equation state @xmath12 with @xmath44 at the present epoch .",
    "the spatial part @xmath45 of the geodesic acceleration ( which measures the relative acceleration of two geodesics in the spacetime ) satisfies an _ exact _ equation in general relativity ( see e.g. , page 332 of @xcite ) given by : @xmath46 this shows that the source of geodesic acceleration is @xmath47 and not @xmath8 . as long as @xmath48 , gravity remains attractive while @xmath49 can lead to repulsive gravitational effects .",
    "in other words , dark energy with sufficiently negative pressure will accelerate the expansion of the universe , once it starts dominating over the normal matter .",
    "this is precisely what is established from the study of high redshift supernova , which can be used to determine the expansion rate of the universe in the past @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : tptrc ] presents the supernova data as a phase portrait @xcite of the universe ( plotting the ` velocity ' @xmath50 against position @xmath51 ) .",
    "it is clear that the universe was decelerating at high redshifts and started accelerating when it was about two - third of the present size .",
    "the simplest model for a fluid with negative pressure is the cosmological constant ( for a review , see @xcite ) with @xmath52 constant ( which is the model used in figure [ fig : tptrc ] ) .",
    "if the dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant , then it introduces a fundamental length scale in the theory @xmath53 , related to the constant dark energy density @xmath54 by @xmath55 . in classical general relativity ,",
    "based on the constants @xmath56 and @xmath57 , it is not possible to construct any dimensionless combination from these constants .",
    "but when one introduces the planck constant , @xmath58 , it is possible to form the dimensionless combination @xmath59 .",
    "observations then require @xmath60 .",
    "as has been mentioned several times in literature , this will require enormous fine tuning .",
    "what is more , in the past , the energy density of normal matter and radiation would have been higher while the energy density contributed by the cosmological constant does not change . hence we need to adjust the energy densities of normal matter and cosmological constant in the early epoch very carefully so that @xmath61 around the current epoch .",
    "this raises the second of the two cosmological constant problems : why is it that @xmath62 at the _ current _ phase of the universe ?    because of these conceptual problems associated with the cosmological constant ,",
    "people have explored a large variety of alternative possibilities .",
    "the most popular among them uses a scalar field @xmath63 with a suitably chosen potential @xmath64 so as to make the vacuum energy vary with time .",
    "the hope then is that , one can find a model in which the current value can be explained naturally without any fine tuning .",
    "a simple form of the source with variable @xmath13 are scalar fields with lagrangians of different forms , of which we will discuss two possibilities : @xmath65^{1/2 }    \\label{lquineq}\\ ] ] both these lagrangians involve one arbitrary function @xmath64 . the first one , @xmath66 , which is a natural generalization of the lagrangian for a non - relativistic particle , @xmath67 , is usually called quintessence ( for a sample of models , see @xcite ) .",
    "when it acts as a source in friedman universe , it is characterized by a time dependent @xmath68 with @xmath69    the structure of the second lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lquineq ] ) can be understood by a simple analogy from special relativity ( see the first reference in @xcite ) . a relativistic particle with ( one dimensional ) position @xmath70 and mass @xmath71 is described by the lagrangian @xmath72 .",
    "it has the energy @xmath73 and momentum @xmath74 which are related by @xmath75 .",
    "as is well known , this allows the possibility of having _ massless _ particles with finite energy for which @xmath76 .",
    "this is achieved by taking the limit of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , while keeping the ratio in @xmath73 finite .",
    "the momentum acquires a life of its own , unconnected with the velocity @xmath79 , and the energy is expressed in terms of the momentum ( rather than in terms of @xmath79 ) in the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "we can now construct a field theory by upgrading @xmath70 to a field @xmath63 .",
    "relativistic invariance now requires @xmath80 to depend on both space and time [ @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be replaced by @xmath83 .",
    "it is also possible now to treat the mass parameter @xmath71 as a function of @xmath63 , say , @xmath64 thereby obtaining a field theoretic lagrangian @xmath84 .",
    "the hamiltonian structure of this theory is algebraically very similar to the special relativistic example we started with .",
    "in particular , the theory allows solutions in which @xmath85 , @xmath86 simultaneously , keeping the energy ( density ) finite .",
    "such solutions will have finite momentum density ( analogous to a massless particle with finite momentum @xmath18 ) and energy density . since the solutions can now depend on both space and time ( unlike the special relativistic example in which @xmath87 depended only on time )",
    ", the momentum density can be an arbitrary function of the spatial coordinate .",
    "this provides a rich gamut of possibilities in the context of cosmology .",
    "@xcite , this form of scalar field arises in string theories @xcite and  for technical reasons  is called a tachyonic scalar field .",
    "( the structure of this lagrangian is similar to those analyzed in a wide class of models called _ k - essence _ ; see for example , @xcite )    the stress tensor for the tachyonic scalar field can be written as the sum of a pressure less dust component and a cosmological constant ( see the first reference in @xcite ) . to show this explicitly",
    ", we break up the density @xmath8 and the pressure @xmath88 and write them in a more suggestive form as @xmath89 where @xmath90 this means that the stress tensor can be thought of as made up of two components  one behaving like a pressure - less fluid , while the other having a negative pressure .",
    "this suggests a possibility of providing a unified description of both dark matter and dark energy using the same scalar field @xcite .",
    "when @xmath91 is small ( compared to @xmath92 in the case of quintessence or compared to unity in the case of tachyonic field ) , both these sources have @xmath93 and mimic a cosmological constant .",
    "when @xmath94 , the quintessence has @xmath95 leading to @xmath96 ; the tachyonic field , on the other hand , has @xmath97 for @xmath98 and behaves like non - relativistic matter . in both the cases , @xmath99 , though it is possible to construct more complicated scalar field lagrangians @xcite with even @xmath100 describing what is called _ phantom _ matter .",
    "( for some alternatives to scalar field models , based on brane world scenarios , see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "since the quintessence field ( or the tachyonic field ) has an undetermined free function @xmath64 , it is possible to choose this function in order to produce a given @xmath101 . to see this explicitly ,",
    "let us assume that the universe has two forms of energy density with @xmath102 where @xmath103 arises from any known forms of source ( matter , radiation , ... ) and @xmath104 is due to a scalar field .",

    "these equations determine @xmath109 and @xmath110 and thus the potential @xmath64 .",

    "in this case , the dark energy density is said to `` track '' the background energy density .",
    "while this could be a model for dark matter , there are strong constraints on the total energy density of the universe at the epoch of nucleosynthesis .",

    "similar results exists for the tachyonic scalar field as well @xcite .",
    "for example , given any @xmath101 , one can construct a tachyonic potential @xmath64 so that the scalar field is the source for the cosmology .",
    "the equations determining @xmath64 are now given by : @xmath128 @xmath129 equations ( [ finalone ] ) and ( [ finaltwo ] ) completely solve the problem .",
    "given any @xmath101 , these equations determine @xmath109 and @xmath110 and thus the potential @xmath64 . as an example , consider a universe with power law expansion @xmath130 .",
    "if it is populated only by a tachyonic scalar field , then @xmath131 ; further , @xmath132 in equation ( [ finalone ] ) is a constant making @xmath133 a constant .",

    "( for the cosmological model , based on this potential , see @xcite . ) a wide variety of phenomenological models with time dependent cosmological constant  have been considered in the literature all of which can be mapped to a scalar field model with a suitable @xmath64 .",
    "while the scalar field models enjoy considerable popularity ( one reason being they are easy to construct ! ) it is very doubtful whether they have helped us to understand the nature of the dark energy at any deeper level .",
    "these models , viewed objectively , suffer from several shortcomings :     at all epochs .",
    "( for more details , see @xcite . ) ]    * they completely lack predictive power .",
    "as explicitly demonstrated above , virtually every form of @xmath5 can be modeled by a suitable  designer \" @xmath64 .",
    "* these models are degenerate in another sense .",
    "the previous discussion illustrates that even when @xmath138 is known / specified , it is not possible to proceed further and determine the nature of the scalar field lagrangian .",
    "the explicit examples given above show that there are _ at least _ two different forms of scalar field lagrangians ( corresponding to the quintessence or the tachyonic field ) which could lead to the same @xmath138 .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for an explicit example of such a construction . ) * all the scalar field potentials require fine tuning of the parameters in order to be viable .",
    "this is obvious in the quintessence models in which adding a constant to the potential is the same as invoking a cosmological constant .",
    "so to make the quintessence models work , _ we first need to assume the cosmological constant  is zero .",
    "_ these models , therefore , merely push the cosmological constant problem to another level , making it somebody else s problem!. * by and large , the potentials used in the literature have no natural field theoretical justification .",
    "all of them are non - renormalisable in the conventional sense and have to be interpreted as a low energy effective potential in an adhoc manner .",
    "* one key difference between cosmological constant  and scalar field models is that the latter lead to a @xmath138 which varies with time .",
    "if observations have demanded this , or even if observations have ruled out @xmath139 at the present epoch , then one would have been forced to take alternative models seriously .",
    "however , all available observations are consistent with cosmological constant  ( @xmath139 ) and  in fact  the possible variation of @xmath13 is strongly constrained @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : bjp2ps ] .",
    "( also see @xcite ) .",
    "given this situation , we shall now take a more serious look at the cosmological constant  as the source of dark energy in the universe .",
    "if we assume that the dark energy in the universe is due to a cosmological constant then we are introducing a second length scale , @xmath140 , into the theory ( in addition to the planck length @xmath141 ) such that @xmath142 .",
    "such a universe will be asymptotically desitter with @xmath143 at late times",
    ". we will now explore several peculiar features of such a universe .",
    "figure [ fig : tpplumian ] summarizes these features @xcite . using the characteristic length scale of expansion , the hubble radius @xmath144 , we can distinguish between three different phases of such a universe . the first phase is when the universe went through a inflationary expansion with @xmath145 constant ; the second phase is the radiation / matter dominated phase in which most of the standard cosmology operates and @xmath146 increases monotonically ; the third phase is that of re - inflation ( or accelerated expansion ) governed by the cosmological constant in which @xmath146 is again a constant .",
    "the first and last phases are time translation invariant ; that is , @xmath147 constant is an ( approximate ) invariance for the universe in these two phases .",
    "the universe satisfies the perfect cosmological principle and is in steady state during these phases !    in fact , one can easily imagine a scenario in which the two desitter phases ( first and last ) are of arbitrarily long duration @xcite . if @xmath148 the final desitter phase _ does _ last forever ; as regards the inflationary phase , nothing prevents it from lasting for arbitrarily long duration .",
    "viewed from this perspective , the in between phase  in which most of the ` interesting ' cosmological phenomena occur  is of negligible measure in the span of time .",
    "it merely connects two steady state phases of the universe .",
    "( in a way , this scenario provides the ultimate generalisation of the copernican principle .",
    "it was well known that we are not in a special position in _ space _ in our universe .",
    "the composition of the universe also shows that we are not made of the most dominant constituent of the universe . finally , in this picture",
    ", we are not even existing at a generic moment of _ time _ in the evolution of the universe ! )    given the two length scales @xmath141 and @xmath57 , one can construct two energy scales @xmath149 and @xmath150 in natural units ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "the first is , of course , the planck energy density while the second one also has a natural interpretation .",
    "the universe which is asymptotically desitter has a horizon and associated thermodynamics @xcite with a temperature @xmath152 and the corresponding thermal energy density @xmath153 .",
    "thus @xmath141 determines the _ highest _ possible energy density in the universe while @xmath57 determines the _ lowest _ possible energy density in this universe . as the energy density of normal matter drops below this value",
    ", the thermal ambience of the desitter phase will remain constant and provide the irreducible ` vacuum noise ' .",
    "note that the dark energy density is the the geometric mean @xmath154 between the two energy densities .",
    "if we define a dark energy length scale @xmath155 such that @xmath156 then @xmath157 is the geometric mean of the two length scales in the universe .",
    "the figure [ fig : tpplumian ] also shows the variation of @xmath155 by broken horizontal lines .",
    "while the two desitter phases can last forever in principle , there is a natural cut off length scale in both of them which makes the region of physical relevance to be finite @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the case of re - inflation in the late universe .",
    "as the universe grows exponentially in the phase 3 , the wavelength of cmbr photons are being redshifted rapidly .",
    "when the temperature of the cmbr radiation drops below the desitter temperature ( which happens when the wavelength of the typical cmbr photon is stretched to the @xmath57 . )",
    "the universe will be essentially dominated by the vacuum thermal noise of the desitter phase .",
    "this happens at the point marked f when the expansion factor is @xmath158 determined by the equation @xmath159 .",
    "let @xmath160 be the epoch at which cosmological constant started dominating over matter , so that @xmath161",
    ". then we find that the dynamic range of df is @xmath162    interestingly enough , one can also impose a similar bound on the physically relevant duration of inflation .",
    "we know that the quantum fluctuations generated during this inflationary phase could act as seeds of structure formation in the universe @xcite .",
    "consider a perturbation at some given wavelength scale which is stretched with the expansion of the universe as @xmath163 .",
    "( see the line marked ab in figure [ fig : tpplumian ] . ) during the inflationary phase , the hubble radius remains constant while the wavelength increases , so that the perturbation will ` exit ' the hubble radius at some time ( the point a in figure [ fig : tpplumian ] ) . in the radiation dominated phase",
    ", the hubble radius @xmath164 grows faster than the wavelength @xmath165 .",
    "hence , normally , the perturbation will ` re - enter ' the hubble radius at some time ( the point b in figure [ fig : tpplumian ] ) .",
    "if there was no re - inflation , this will make _ all _ wavelengths re - enter the hubble radius sooner or later .",
    "but if the universe undergoes re - inflation , then the hubble radius ` flattens out ' at late times and some of the perturbations will _ never _ reenter the hubble radius ! the limiting perturbation which just ` grazes ' the hubble radius as the universe enters the re - inflationary phase is shown by the line marked cd in figure [ fig : tpplumian ] . if we use the criterion that we need the perturbation to reenter the hubble radius , we get a natural bound on the duration of inflation which is of direct astrophysical relevance .",
    "this portion of the inflationary regime is marked by ce and can be calculated as follows : consider a perturbation which leaves the hubble radius ( @xmath166 ) during the inflationary epoch at @xmath167 .",
    "it will grow to the size @xmath168 at a later epoch .",
    "we want to determine @xmath169 such that this length scale grows to @xmath57 just when the dark energy starts dominating over matter ; that is at the epoch @xmath170 .",
    "this gives @xmath171 so that @xmath172 . on the other hand , the inflation ends at @xmath173 where @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the temperature to which the universe has been reheated at the end of inflation . using these two results",
    "we can determine the dynamic range of ce to be @xmath176 where we have used the fact that , for a guts scale inflation with @xmath177 we have @xmath178 .",
    "for a planck scale inflation with @xmath179 , the phases ce and df are approximately equal .",
    "the region in the quadrilateral cedf is the most relevant part of standard cosmology , though the evolution of the universe can extend to arbitrarily large stretches in both directions in time .",
    "this figure is definitely telling us something regarding the time translation invariance of the universe ( ` the perfect cosmological principle ' ) and  more importantly  _ about the breaking of this symmetry _ , but it is not easy to translate this concept into a workable theory .",
    "let us now turn our attention to few of the many attempts to understand the cosmological constant .",
    "this is , of course , a non - representative sample ( dictated by personal bias ! ) and a host of other approaches exist in literature , some of which can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the _ least _ esoteric ideas regarding the dark energy is that the cosmological constant term in the frw equations arises because we have not calculated the energy density driving the expansion of the universe correctly .",
    "the motivation for such a suggestion arises from the following fact : the energy momentum tensor of the real universe , @xmath180 is inhomogeneous and anisotropic and will lead to a very complex metric @xmath181 if only we could solve the exact einstein s equations @xmath182=\\kappa t_{ab}$ ] .",
    "the metric describing the large scale structure of the universe should be obtained by averaging this exact solution over a large enough scale , to get @xmath183 .",
    "but what we actually do is to average the stress tensor _ first _ to get @xmath184 and _ then _ solve einstein s equations .",
    "but since @xmath182 $ ] is nonlinear function of the metric , @xmath185\\rangle \\neq g_{ab}[\\langle g\\rangle ] $ ] and there is a discrepancy .",
    "this is most easily seen by writing @xmath186=\\kappa [ \\langle t_{ab}\\rangle   + \\kappa^{-1}(g_{ab}[\\langle g\\rangle ] -\\langle g_{ab}[g]\\rangle ) ] \\equiv \\kappa [ \\langle t_{ab}\\rangle   + t_{ab}^{corr}]\\ ] ] if  based on observations  we take the @xmath183 to be the standard friedman metric , this equation shows that it has , as its source , _ two _ terms : the first is the standard average stress tensor and the second is a purely geometrical correction term @xmath187-\\langle g_{ab}[g]\\rangle ) $ ] which arises because of nonlinearities in the einstein s theory that leads to @xmath185\\rangle \\neq g_{ab}[\\langle g\\rangle ] $ ] .",
    "if this term can mimic the cosmological constant  at large scales there will be no need for dark energy !",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to settle this question to complete satisfaction @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to use some analytic approximations to nonlinear perturbations ( usually called non - linear scaling relations , see e.g. @xcite ) to estimate this term .",
    "this does not lead to a stress tensor that mimics dark energy ( padmanabhan , unpublished ) but this is not a conclusive proof either way .",
    "we mention this mainly because this issue deserves more attention than it has received .",
    "another possible way of addressing this issue is to simply eliminate from the gravitational theory those modes which couple to cosmological constant .",
    "if , for example , we have a theory in which the source of gravity is @xmath188 rather than @xmath189 in eq .",
    "( [ nextnine ] ) , then cosmological constant  will not couple to gravity at all .",
    "( the non linear coupling of matter with gravity has several subtleties ; see eg .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to develop a covariant theory of gravity using @xmath188 as the source .",
    "but we can achieve the same objective in different manner .",
    "any metric @xmath181 can be expressed in the form @xmath190 such that @xmath191 so that @xmath192 . from the action functional for gravity",
    "@xmath193 it is obvious that the cosmological constant  couples _ only _ to the conformal factor @xmath194 .",
    "so if we consider a theory of gravity in which @xmath195 is kept constant and only @xmath196 is varied , then such a model will be oblivious of direct coupling to cosmological constant .",
    "if the action ( without the @xmath197 term ) is varied , keeping @xmath198 , say , then one is lead to a _ unimodular theory of gravity _ with the equations of motion @xmath199 with zero trace on both sides . using the bianchi identity , it is now easy to show that this is equivalent to a theory with an _ arbitrary _ cosmological constant .",
    "that is , cosmological constant  arises as an undetermined integration constant in this model @xcite .    while this is interesting , we need an extra physical principle to fix its value .",
    "one possible way of doing this is to interpret the @xmath197 term in the action as a lagrange multiplier for the proper volume of the spacetime .",
    "then it is reasonable to choose the cosmological constant  such that the total proper volume of the universe is equal to a specified number .",
    "while this will lead to a cosmological constant  which has the correct order of magnitude , it has several obvious problems .",
    "first , the proper four volume of the universe is infinite unless we make the spatial sections compact and restrict the range of time integration .",
    "second , this will lead to a dark energy density which varies as @xmath200 ( corresponding to @xmath201 ) which is ruled out by observations .",
    "the conventional discussion of the relation between cosmological constant and vacuum energy density is based on evaluating the zero point energy of quantum fields with an ultraviolet cutoff and using the result as a source of gravity .",
    "any reasonable cutoff will lead to a vacuum energy density @xmath202 which is unacceptably high .",
    "this argument , however , is too simplistic since the zero point energy  obtained by summing over the @xmath203  has no observable consequence in any other phenomena and can be subtracted out by redefining the hamiltonian .",
    "the observed non trivial features of the vacuum state of qed , for example , arise from the _ fluctuations _ ( or modifications ) of this vacuum energy rather than the vacuum energy itself .",
    "this was , in fact , known fairly early in the history of cosmological constant problem and , in fact , is stressed by zeldovich @xcite who explicitly calculated one possible contribution to _ fluctuations _ after subtracting away the mean value .",
    "this suggests that we should consider the fluctuations in the vacuum energy density in addressing the cosmological constant problem .",
    "if the vacuum probed by the gravity can readjust to take away the bulk energy density @xmath204 , quantum _ fluctuations _ can generate the observed value @xmath205 .",
    "one of the simplest models @xcite which achieves this uses the fact that , in the semiclassical limit , the wave function describing the universe of proper four - volume @xmath206 will vary as @xmath207 $ ] . if we treat @xmath208 as conjugate variables then uncertainty principle suggests @xmath209 .",
    "if the four volume is built out of planck scale substructures , giving @xmath210 , then the poisson fluctuations will lead to @xmath211 giving @xmath212 .",
    "( this idea can be a more quantitative ; see @xcite ) .",
    "similar viewpoint arises , more formally , when we study the question of _ detecting _ the energy density using gravitational field as a probe .",
    "recall that an unruh - dewitt detector with a local coupling @xmath213 $ ] to the _ field _",
    "@xmath63 actually responds to @xmath214 rather than to the field itself @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can use the gravitational field as a natural  detector \" of energy momentum tensor @xmath215 with the standard coupling @xmath216 .",
    "such a model was analysed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and it was shown that the gravitational field responds to the two point function @xmath217 .",
    "in fact , it is essentially this fluctuations in the energy density which is computed in the inflationary models @xcite as the seed _ source _ for gravitational field , as stressed in ref .",
    "all these suggest treating the energy fluctuations as the physical quantity  detected \" by gravity , when one needs to incorporate quantum effects .",
    "if the cosmological constant  arises due to the energy density of the vacuum , then one needs to understand the structure of the quantum vacuum at cosmological scales .",
    "quantum theory , especially the paradigm of renormalization group has taught us that the energy density  and even the concept of the vacuum state  depends on the scale at which it is probed .",
    "the vacuum state which we use to study the lattice vibrations in a solid , say , is not the same as vacuum state of the qed . using this feature , it is possible to construct systems in condensed matter physics @xcite wherein the quantity analogous to vacuum energy density has to vanish on the average because of dynamical reasons .",
    "in fact , it seems _ inevitable _ that in a universe with two length scale @xmath218 , the vacuum fluctuations will contribute an energy density of the correct order of magnitude @xmath154 .",
    "the hierarchy of energy scales in such a universe has @xcite the pattern @xmath219 the first term is the bulk energy density which needs to be renormalised away ( by a process which we do not understand at present ) ; the third term is just the thermal energy density of the desitter vacuum state ; what is interesting is that quantum fluctuations in the matter fields _ inevitably generate _ the second term .",
    "the key new ingredient arises from the fact that the properties of the vacuum state depends on the scale at which it is probed and it is not appropriate to ask questions without specifying this scale .",
    "( these ideas have been developed more generally in ref .",
    "if the spacetime has a cosmological horizon which blocks information , the natural scale is provided by the size of the horizon , @xmath57 , and we should use observables defined within the accessible region . the operator @xmath220 , corresponding to the total energy inside a region bounded by a cosmological horizon , will exhibit fluctuations @xmath221 since vacuum state is not an eigenstate of _ this _ operator .",
    "the corresponding fluctuations in the energy density , @xmath222 will now depend on both the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath141 as well as @xmath57 . to obtain @xmath223 which scales as @xmath224 we need to have @xmath225 ; that is , the square of the energy fluctuations should scale as the surface area of the bounding surface which is provided by the cosmic horizon . remarkably enough",
    ", a rigorous calculation @xcite of the dispersion in the energy shows that for @xmath226 , the final result indeed has the scaling @xmath227 where the constant @xmath228 depends on the manner in which ultra violet cutoff is imposed .",
    "similar calculations have been done ( with a completely different motivation , in the context of entanglement entropy ) by several people and it is known that the area scaling found in eq .",
    "( [ deltae ] ) , proportional to @xmath229 , is a generic feature @xcite . for a simple exponential uv - cutoff , @xmath230 but",
    "can not be computed reliably without knowing the full theory .",
    "we thus find that the fluctuations in the energy density of the vacuum in a sphere of radius @xmath57 is given by @xmath231 the numerical coefficient will depend on @xmath228 as well as the precise nature of infrared cutoff radius ( like whether it is @xmath57 or @xmath232 etc . )",
    ". it would be pretentious to cook up the factors to obtain the observed value for dark energy density .",
    "but it is a fact of life that a fluctuation of magnitude @xmath233 will exist in the energy density inside a sphere of radius @xmath234 if planck length is the uv cut off .",
    "_ one can not get away from it .",
    "_ on the other hand , observations suggest that there is a @xmath235 of similar magnitude in the universe .",
    "it seems natural to identify the two , after subtracting out the mean value by hand .",
    "our approach explains why there is a _ surviving _ cosmological constant which satisfies @xmath154 which  in our opinion  is _ the _ problem .",
    "there is a completely different way of interpreting this result based on some imaginative ideas suggested by bjorken @xcite recently .",
    "the key idea is to parametrise the universes by the value of @xmath57 which they have .",
    "it is a fixed , pure number for each universe in an ensemble of universes but all the other parameters of the physics are assumed to be correlated with @xmath57 .",
    "this is motivated by a series of arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite and , in this approach , @xmath236 almost by definition ; the hard work was in determining how other parameters scale with @xmath57 . in",
    "the approach suggested here , a dynamical interpretation of the scaling @xmath236 is given as due to vacuum fluctuations of fields .",
    "we now reinterpret each member of of the ensemble of universes as having zero energy density for vacuum ( as any decent vacuum should have ) but the effective @xmath235 arises from the quantum fluctuations _ with the correct scaling_. one can then invoke standard anthropic - like arguments ( but with very significant differences as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) to choose a range for the size of our universe .",
    "this appears to be much more attractive way of interpreting the result .    finally ,",
    "to be fair , this attempt should be judged in the backdrop of other suggested solutions almost all of which require introducing extra degrees of freedom in the form of scalar fields , modifying gravity or introducing higher dimensions etc . _ and _ fine tuning the potentials . at a fundamental level such approaches are unlikely to provide the final solution .",
    "i thank k. subramanian for two decades of discussion about various aspects of cosmological constant and for sharing and reinforcing the view that any quick - fix solution to this problem will be futile .",
    "i also thank apoorva patel for useful discussions .",
