    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) exhibits a well - known dipole anisotropy @xcite which is three orders of magnitude bigger than the primordial temperature fluctuations first detected by cobe @xcite .",
    "an observer moving through an isotropic radiation field would observe such a dipole @xcite and conversely the observed dipole can be used to infer the velocity of the observer . indeed",
    "the velocity of the solar system ( and our local group ) is inferred from the cmb temperature dipole assuming that the latter is entirely due to our motion .",
    "although a kinematic origin is the most plausible interpretation of the cmb dipole , one can consider other mechanisms which may be , at least partially , responsible @xcite .",
    "an independent measurement of our velocity is therefore desirable .",
    "it has been suggested that this can be done by measuring the aberration of the cmb @xcite , however the effect is too small to be detected with @xmath8 significance even using the best available data to date @xcite .",
    "if the dipole is due to our motion then it requires the universe to be anisotropic at least locally .",
    "indeed galaxy surveys clearly exhibit an anisotropy in the local universe . along the direction of the cmb dipole",
    "lie the most massive neighbouring superclusters : virgo , the great attractor hydra - centaurus , coma , hercules and shapley , and possibly yet - to - be - mapped superclusters beyond these ( see table [ tab : localsuperclusters ] ) .",
    "the gravitational attraction of these structures may well be pulling us in the direction indicated by the cmb dipole .",
    "however , maps of the local universe , _ e.g. _ from the infrared 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ) or supernova catalogues , have shown that the full dipole _ can not _ be attributed to these structures and at least 20% remains unaccounted for @xcite .",
    "it is then necessary to go beyond even the shapley supercluster ( at @xmath9  mpc ) to establish if there is indeed convergence to the cmb frame at larger scales ( as is required if the universe is to be described as homogeneous when averaged on such scales ) .",
    "however , there are no full - sky optical galaxy redshift surveys extending well beyond shapley and previous studies in this context have therefore suffered from lack of full sky coverage ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "further complications arise when using other catalogues such as of galaxy clusters to search for the expected dipole signal ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "there have in fact been persistent reports of an anomalous ` dark flow ' on large scales traced by the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters , in roughly the same direction as the cmb dipole @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , radio galaxies are extremely luminous , can be observed up to high redshifts , and are unaffected by dust obscuration . however early analyses of the dipole in the distribution of radio galaxies suffered from the severe sparseness of their catalogues @xcite .",
    "hence such studies became feasible only after the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) catalogue became available .",
    "this is a catalogue of nearly 2 million radio galaxies covering the sky above declination of @xmath10 .",
    "nvss has been used extensively to search for convergence to the cmb dipole and most previous studies have found _ discrepancy _ with the cmb measurement of our local velocity @xcite .    while the velocity of the solar system barycentre inferred from the cmb temperature dipole anisotropy is 368 km  s@xmath1 , the value inferred from nvss ranges from 700 km  s@xmath1 @xcite to over 2000 km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we too find a similarly large velocity and demonstrate that it depends only mildly on the characteristics of the datasets used : _",
    "e.g. _ the width of the galactic and super - galactic plane strips removed from the survey and the lower and upper limits on the flux .",
    "significantly the direction of the velocity is quite robust and well - aligned with the direction of the cmb dipole .",
    "it is hard to understand how such a large difference can have a physical explanation .",
    "previous works @xcite have invoked horizon - scale isocurvature perturbations as an alternative to the kinematic origin for the cmb dipole . here",
    "however , we are observing a dipole far _ larger _ than that inferred from cmb itself , but at high redshift .",
    "in addition local data  specifically distance and redshift catalogues  indicate that at low redshifts a good part of the cmb dipole is recovered by @xmath11  mpc .",
    "although the present data does not allow us to fully explore how the convergence to cmb develops as we go deeper into the universe and in redshift space , the radio data at redshift @xmath12 clearly indicates that a significantly _ larger _ dipole exists in the rest frame of the radio galaxies .",
    "the origin of this difference from the cmb dipole is a real mystery and deserves closer examination .",
    "a possible explanation is systematics due to the incomplete sky coverage of nvss which can generate a spurious dipole @xcite .",
    "various methods have been used to restore the symmetry required for a robust dipole analysis such as cutting out the nvss catalogue above declination of @xmath13 @xcite or removing the galactic and counter - galactic plane @xcite .",
    "our work elaborates on previous studies in several ways .",
    "we construct a _ full - sky _ catalogue , which we call nvsumss , by patching the nvss with its southern - sky counterpart  the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss ) .",
    "this results in a catalogue with about 600,000 radio sources with flux above 10 mjy after cutting out a strip of @xmath14 around the galactic plane in nvss to match the corresponding cut in sumss .",
    "another possible systematic which has often been discussed is contamination by local sources .",
    "it is well known that a large part of the cmb dipole anisotropy is due to the anisotropic local distribution of matter @xcite .",
    "past studies have tried to clean nvss from such local source contamination either by removing individual large local structures @xcite or by cutting out the super - galactic plane in which the majority of local superclusters lie @xcite .",
    "however even after all these cuts the radio dipole extracted by all previous studies remains well above that inferred from the cmb . to fully eliminate the contribution from the local structures , we adopt several strategies .",
    "first we cross - correlate nvsumss with the catalogue of local radio sources ( lrs ) @xcite and remove patches ( of increasing area ) around these sources from nvsumss catalogue .",
    "our results are not however significantly altered by doing so .",
    "as the lrs catalogue is limited to sources brighter than 200 mjy , we go further by next removing eight dominant local superclusters from virgo to ophiuchus .",
    "previous studies have shown that these local structures are responsible for nearly @xmath15 of the cmb dipole .",
    "even so their removal does not alter our results significantly .",
    "we then remove the super - galactic plane completely by cutting out a @xmath14 strip around it .",
    "this too has little effect .",
    "finally we cross - correlate nvsumss with the 2mrs catalogue , and remove zones of increasingly larger areas around the 2mrs sources from the nvsumss catalogue .",
    "this too has no significant impact .",
    "because of evolution , the fraction of nearby radio sources is low even at large flux densities , the median redshift of radio sources in complete samples with flux ranging from mjy to jy being @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the fact that the redshift distribution of complete samples of radio sources peaks at @xmath12 for all flux - density levels down to @xmath17 mjy , implies that local sources are swamped by the much more numerous distant ones @xcite .",
    "the mean redshift of nvss sources is estimated to be above 1 @xcite .",
    "thus most of the sources in our nvsumss catalogue lie at high redshift and by removing local sources through cross - correlation of nvsumss with the 2mrs catalogue we ensure that they constitute an uniform background . our motion with respect to such an uniform background causes the aberration of light and the sources would thus be displaced in the sky by an angle that depends on our velocity .",
    "more sources would be observed in the direction of the motion than in the opposite direction .",
    "thus by measuring the aberration angle , we infer the velocity of the solar system ( or the local group ) barycentre in the rest frame of the distant radio galaxies . a catalogue with good sky coverage would exhibit a hemispherical asymmetry which peaks when the plane of hemisphere is perpendicular to the direction of the motion .",
    "a simple formula can be used to determine the aberration angle and hence our velocity in the rest frame of the radio sources .",
    "aberration analysis is very powerful in the sense that it is _ independent _ of distance so can be used in conjunction with a full - sky photometric galaxy survey , as long as there are no observational biases that can generate spurious anisotropies . in fact the motion of the observer does not just cause aberration but also results in doppler boosting which is a shift in the frequency at which the sources are observed  as a result more sources will be observed in the direction of the motion . unlike aberration , doppler boosting depends on the flux and it is known that for radio sources the two effects affect the number - count in almost equal proportion .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we describe our method , and search for dipole anisotropy in the nvss data alone ( section [ sec : nvss ] )",
    ". then we introduce the sumss catalogue ( section [ sec : sumss ] ) and patch nvss and sumss together ( section [ sec : nvsumss ] ) exploring different ways of doing so . in section [ sec : local ] we perform a complete cleaning up of local sources by cross - correlating nvsumss with the 2mrs catalogue .",
    "we investigate the effects of various cuts made on the inferred dipole velocity and discuss the statistical significance of the result ( section [ sec : ss ] ) .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] ."
