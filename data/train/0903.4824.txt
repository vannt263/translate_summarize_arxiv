    "many problems in electronic structure and electron transport calculations involve the evaluation of integrals containing the fermi function .",
    "these are in general difficult to compute and therefore several approximation schemes have been developed @xcite . among them the sommerfeld expansion @xcite and the matsubara expansion @xcite being the most prominent ones . while the former is by construction useful for low temperatures , the latter provides in principle a way to cover the range from low to high temperatures .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the expansion in a ( finite ) sum of simple poles is particularly suitable for evaluating the integrals by making use of the residue theorem .",
    "for example , finite temperature charge density calculations only require the evaluation of a green s function at a finite set of energies @xcite given by the poles of the expansion .",
    "recently the same concept was used for the auxiliary density matrix propagation in the context of time - resolved electron transport in molecular wires @xcite .",
    "the major disadvantage of the matsubara expansion consists in its poor convergence behavior , the error decreasing only linearly with the number of terms in the expansion .",
    "here we derive an expansion of the fermi function in terms of simple poles with particularly simple coefficients",
    ". we will show that it converges very rapidly with increasing order of the expansion in a well - defined region which is found to increase linearly with the order .    for the following discussion it is convenient to write the fermi function @xmath0 in terms of a dimensionless variable @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the chemical potential , @xmath4 is the temperature , @xmath5 is the boltzmann factor and @xmath6 denotes the energy .",
    "the expansion consists in finding a partial fraction decomposition with simple poles of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 are expansion coefficients and @xmath9 are ( possibly complex ) poles . for practical purposes",
    "the sum over @xmath10 is truncated and the fermi function is approximated by @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the number of terms in the expansion .",
    "for example , the well - known matsubara expansion @xcite is given in terms of the purely imaginary zeros @xmath13 of the denominator in eq.([eq : fermifunc ] ) , @xmath14 , which yields coefficients @xmath15 and gives @xmath16 for @xmath17 in eq.([eq : matsubaraexp ] ) the expansion becomes exact .",
    "however , the convergence is very slow , which renders the application of this expansion impractical especially for low temperatures .",
    "the proposed partial fraction decomposition ( pfd ) is obtained by firstly writing eq.([eq : fermifunc ] ) as @xcite @xmath18 and secondly by expanding numerator and denominator in a power series , truncating the respective sums , such that the degree of the polynomial in the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator polynomial .",
    "this procedure gives @xmath19 with polynomials @xmath20 this construction allows for a pfd , i.e.  an expansion of the form @xmath21 here , @xmath22 are the zeros of the polynomial @xmath23 , which appear in pairs since @xmath23 contains only even powers of @xmath24 .",
    "it can be shown that the zeros can be obtained as @xmath25 , whereby the @xmath26 are the eigenvalues of the following matrix @xcite , @xmath27 the eigenvalues can be efficiently calculated using standard methods . in fig.[fig : pfdeig ] we have plotted the poles of eq.([eq : partfracdecomp ] ) , given as @xmath28 , for three sets of eigenvalues @xmath26 for different sizes @xmath29 of the matrix @xmath30 . as can be seen from the figure some of the poles @xmath31 arising from the pfd are purely imaginary and are close to the matsubara poles .",
    "on the other hand there are also poles with a non - vanishing real part , which display an irregular distribution .",
    "these very poles improve considerably the approximation for the fermi function as we show below .    ) of the pfd expansion , i.e.  @xmath32 , with @xmath26 the eigenvalues of matrix ( [ eq : zmatrix ] ) for various orders @xmath12 . for comparison",
    "the purely imaginary poles ( symbol @xmath33 ) of the matsubara expansion ( [ eq : matsubaraexp ] ) are shown as well .",
    "note the different scales of the three graphs . ]",
    "it remains to determine the corresponding expansion coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath34 in eq.([eq : partfracdecomp ] ) .",
    "multiplying both sides of this equation by @xmath35 and letting @xmath36 leaves on the right side of eq.([eq : partfracdecomp ] ) only the term @xmath37 , which is thus given as @xmath38 by means of the definitions ( [ eq : polyqandp ] ) one finds from this limit @xmath39 and similarly @xmath40 .",
    "thus we arrive at the main result of this paper : the fermi function can be approximated by the finite sum @xmath41 with @xmath26 the eigenvalues of matrix ( [ eq : zmatrix ] ) .     for expansion orders @xmath42 ( full lines ) .",
    "panel a : matsubara expansion eq.([eq : matsubaraexp ] ) , panel b : partial fraction decomposition eq.([eq : pfdexp ] ) .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the formal structure of this approximation is similar to the matsubara expansion ( [ eq : matsubaraexp ] ) .",
    "however , taking advantage of having complex rather than purely imaginary poles makes the pfd for given order @xmath12 of the expansion vastly superior to the matsubara expansion .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig : fermi ] , where we have shown both expansions for different orders @xmath12 .",
    "whereas the matsubara expansion ( [ eq : matsubaraexp ] ) in fig.[fig : fermi]a does not give a reasonable representation for any of the orders shown , the pfd expansion ( [ eq : pfdexp ] ) in fig.[fig : fermi]b improves rapidly with increasing order .",
    "from fig.[fig : fermi ] it becomes clear that the pfd is indeed converging faster than the matsubara expansion . in the following",
    "we will quantify the rate of convergence as @xmath17 and give a range for @xmath1 where this convergence behavior can be expected .",
    ", but the discussion applies in an analogous manner also to @xmath45 . ] to this end we define the deviation of the finite expansion from the exact function as @xmath46 regarding the pfd one makes two observations : first , in terms of the scaled variable @xmath47 one finds in the limit of large @xmath12 , @xmath48 the asymptotic function ( [ eq : error ] ) is shown along with deviations @xmath49 for various finite @xmath12 in fig.[fig : fermiconvergence]a .",
    "second , in the range @xmath50 , i.e.  @xmath51 , the rate of convergence is given by the asymptotic expression @xmath52 which due to the factorial in the denominator decreases faster than exponential .",
    "eqs.([eq : error ] ) and ( [ eq : convergence ] ) are the main results of this section .",
    "they corroborate the statement that the pfd is expected to yield a better convergence and allow to estimate the error in actual calculations .     of the approximated fermi function form the exact one as defined in eq.([eq : deltaf ] ) .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in the remaining part of this section we will justify and discuss eqs.([eq : error ] ) and ( [ eq : convergence ] ) . considering the case @xmath57 ,",
    "one finds from eq.([eq : pfdexp ] ) , that a finite expansion behaves as @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "since the fermi function gives @xmath60 for @xmath59 one expects qualitatively the behavior given in eq.([eq : error ] ) .",
    "this holds true for any expansion resulting in a finite sum over simple poles including the matsubara expansion , which is shown for @xmath61 as dotted line in fig.[fig : fermiconvergence]a . in order to verify that this behavior is indeed restricted to @xmath57 , or equivalently to @xmath62 ,",
    "we write the polynomial @xmath23 from eq.([eq : polyqandp ] ) explicitly as @xmath63 assuming @xmath57 , we see that the ratio of two successive terms @xmath64 is always larger than @xmath65 ; the terms are monotonically increasing .",
    "thus terms with @xmath66 dominate the sum and we replace the coefficients in @xmath67 by the coefficient from @xmath68 , i.e.  instead of the sum ( [ eq : qpoly ] ) we define @xmath69 it turns out that in the limit @xmath70 this sum becomes equal to @xmath71 , which can be seen by considering the difference of the newly defined terms in eq.([eq : appqpoly ] ) from the original terms in eq.([eq : qpoly ] ) . for @xmath72 one",
    "gets @xmath73 this expression vanishes for @xmath74 and can be made arbitrarily small by increasing @xmath12 for all @xmath75 .",
    "terms with larger @xmath76 can be neglected because they are exponentially small compared to those with smaller @xmath76 . since the sum ( [ eq : appqpoly ] ) is a geometric series we obtain @xmath77 analogous considerations for the other polynomial from eqs.([eq : polyqandp ] ) yield @xmath78 with @xmath79 and we get as an approximation for the ratio , once again using @xmath80 , @xmath81 which explains the asymptotic behavior of @xmath82 in eq.([eq : error ] ) for @xmath83 .",
    "turning now to the case @xmath84 , we firstly note that there is a crossover for the ratio ( [ eq : ratioterms ] ) at @xmath85 ; whereas for @xmath86 the terms are increasing , they decrease for @xmath87 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath12 the polynomial expression ( [ eq : pq ] ) converges to the exact expression ( [ eq : sinhcosh ] ) and the deviation @xmath82 vanishes as given by eq.([eq : error ] ) for @xmath88 .",
    "in order to quantify the rate of convergence it is useful to define complementary sums to @xmath89 and @xmath23 , namely @xmath90 therewith the deviation reads @xmath91 the approximation in the second line applies to large values of @xmath12 .",
    "we can choose , for any given @xmath92 , @xmath12 sufficiently large such that @xmath93 .",
    "the infinite sums defined in ( [ eq : complpolyn ] ) become small compared to the exponentials , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "it remains to estimate their behavior for large @xmath12 which can be done in analogy to the considerations for @xmath23 and @xmath89 , cf .",
    "eqs.([eq : qapprox ] ) and ( [ eq : papprox ] ) . here",
    "the ratio of successive terms as defined in eq.([eq : ratioterms ] ) is always smaller than @xmath65 and the first terms in the sum can be used to estimate the sums .",
    "one gets @xmath96 this directly leads to eq.([eq : convergence ] ) and concludes the derivation .",
    "fig.[fig : fermiconvergence]b shows this estimate along with the numerically calculated deviation @xmath53 as a function of the expansion order @xmath12 for selected values of @xmath1 . even for small values of @xmath12",
    "an overall good agreement is found .",
    "moreover , one sees that the deviation @xmath53 is of order @xmath65 as long as @xmath97 .",
    "however , for @xmath98 ( this is where the dashed lines start ) it decreases very rapidly due to the factorial in the denominator in eq.([eq : convergence ] ) .",
    "we have proposed the expansion ( [ eq : pfdexp ] ) of the fermi function ( [ eq : fermifunc ] ) by using a partial fraction decomposition .",
    "its application requires only the diagonalization of a matrix , given in eq.([eq : zmatrix ] ) , which has the same dimension @xmath12 as the expansion .",
    "the expansion converges faster than exponential with increasing order @xmath12 for arguments @xmath99 . in other words ,",
    "the approximation becomes not only more accurate for higher orders , it can also be used for a wider range of arguments .",
    "an estimate for the error is explicitly given by eq.([eq : convergence ] ) . due to the beneficial convergence properties and",
    "the straightforward implementation we expect the pfd to be of great value in any application based on an expansion of the fermi function as sum of over simples poles . finally , we would like to notice that an analogous expansion can be found for the bose - einstein distribution .",
