    "being a major subject of probability theory , measure - valued diffusions , or superprocesses , such as super - brownian motion and the fleming - viot process have been well studied during the last three decades .",
    "important properties of superprocesses have been proved and connections to other areas of mathematics such as partial differential equations have been established . for a detailed exposition of the subject the reader",
    "is referred to  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    here",
    "we introduce briefly super - random walks - the spatially discrete analogues of super - brownian motion . studying",
    "these processes gave a strong motivation to investigate spatial branching processes with interactions , and in particular , mutually catalytic branching processes on discrete space - the main theme of this article .",
    "to introduce super - random walks , we start with the following approximating particle system .",
    "assume that an initial configuration of a large number ( of order @xmath66 ) of particles distributed over @xmath13 is given .",
    "the particles move as independent simple random walk in @xmath13 and each particle independently of the others dies after an exponential time of rate @xmath67 , with @xmath68 , and at the place of death it leaves a random number of offspring particles , drawn from a fixed integer valued law @xmath69 .",
    "the particles of the updated population continue their motion and reproduction according to the same rules .",
    "this process is usually referred to as a branching random walk with the branching law @xmath69 and we will assume in the sequel that @xmath69 has expectation @xmath42 ( this means criticality ) and finite variance @xmath70 .",
    "the process @xmath71 is then defined to be the finite atomic measure which loosely speaking gives measure of mass @xmath42 to each particle alive at time @xmath72 . to be more precise , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a position of the @xmath75-th particle alive at time @xmath72 .",
    "assume that , as @xmath66 tends to infinity , @xmath76 converges weakly in the space of finite measures on @xmath13 to a measure @xmath77 .",
    "then one can show that the measure - valued process @xmath78 converges weakly to a limiting measure - valued process @xmath79 which is called super - random walk and is uniquely characterized via the following martingale problem : for bounded test - functions @xmath80 @xmath81 is a square - integrable martingale with quadratic variation process @xmath82 here , @xmath6 denotes the discrete laplace operator as defined in theorem [ 0 ] .",
    "an interesting observation is the following invariance property : irrespectively of @xmath69 , the finite variance assumption for the branching mechanism @xmath69 leads to a universal limit depending only on the variance @xmath83 and the parameter @xmath7 which is also called the branching rate . in what follows ,",
    "we assume @xmath84 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that if we ignore the spatial motion and count just the total number of particles , the scaling procedure is nothing else but the scaling of critical and finite variance galton - watson processes which leads towards classical feller s branching diffusion @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "note that super - random walks can be characterized as solutions to stochastic differential equations .",
    "abbreviating @xmath87 , the super - random walk is a weak solution to following system of stochastic differential equations ( which is , in fact , a discrete version of a stochastic heat equation ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a collection of independent brownian motions .",
    "next , we proceed to a more recent development : measure - valued processes with interactions . one way to introduce interaction into the model is to replace the constant branching rate @xmath7 in the particle approximation by a random , adapted and space - time varying branching rate @xmath90 , also called the catalyst",
    ". some particular choices of branching environments @xmath7 and related models over continuous space have been discussed in the literature ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , one can consider a super - random walk on @xmath13 in a super - random walk environment .",
    "building upon ( [ e ] ) , this model can be described as a solution to the following system of stochastic differential equations : @xmath91 driven by independent families of independent brownian motions .",
    "a solution @xmath92 is called super - random walk in the catalytic super - random walk environment @xmath93 .",
    "note that ( [ f ] ) describes the so - called one - way interaction model : the @xmath45-population catalyzes the @xmath43-population .",
    "then the natural extension of ( [ f ] ) to two - way interaction is the following mutually catalytic model .    in the following , weak solutions @xmath94 , on a stochastic basis @xmath95 , to the infinite system of stochastic differential equations ( [ ss ] ) driven by independent brownian motions",
    "will be called mutually catalytic branching processes with initial conditions @xmath96 and branching rate @xmath68 . to abbreviate",
    ", solutions will be denoted by * @xmath97*. in the sequel @xmath97 will also denote a mutually catalytic branching process defined on a more general state space @xmath31 instead of @xmath13 and with @xmath32-matrix @xmath98 instead of @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to see that the branching property fails for @xmath97 .",
    "hence , many of the classical tools developed for superprocesses also fail .",
    "nonetheless , the simple symmetric choice of the interaction between @xmath43 and @xmath45 makes this mutually catalytic system tractable .    in order to stress the underlying branching processes ,",
    "the two components will be called types .    as an example for the convention , if @xmath99 for all @xmath19 we will say that the first type died out .",
    "interestingly , the study of mutually catalytic branching processes can also be motivated by the study of interacting diffusion processes . given a family of independent brownian motions @xmath100 and some function @xmath101 to be specified below , discrete - space parabolic stochastic partial differential equations",
    "@xmath102 have been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "some prominent examples will be briefly discussed in the sequel .",
    "[ ex3 ] for @xmath103 solutions of ( [ int ] ) are super - random walks .",
    "this example has already been dealt with in detail in the previous subsection .",
    "[ ex1 ] for @xmath104 , equation ( [ int ] ) is called stepping stone model .    in fact",
    ", the stepping stone model is the spatial generalization of the one - dimensional wright - fisher diffusion @xmath105 that arises as a scaling limit of the moran model in population genetics similarly as the feller diffusion arises as a scaling limit of critical galton - watson processes .",
    "in contrast to the galton - watson model , the moran model is not used to model the total number of individuals but instead counts the proportion of one allele in a diploid population for a fixed number of individuals . in particular",
    ", this interpretation corresponds to the solution of ( [ wf ] ) taking values in @xmath106 $ ] with absorption at @xmath42 or @xmath107 interpreted as fixation of genetic types . for an introduction to the questions of mathematical population genetics we refer to the lecture",
    "notes @xcite .",
    "the stepping stone model of example [ ex1 ] can be seen as an island version of the wright - fisher diffusion , i.e. additionally to the change of alleles , individuals live on islands which they change according to a nearest neighbor random walk .",
    "changing the scope once more , we have a look at statistical physics . given a random field @xmath108 , possibly time - inhomogeneous , the discrete heat equation with random potential @xmath109 @xmath110 has attracted a lot of interest . it is usually referred to as a parabolic anderson model .",
    "again , there is a connection to a branching particle system : started at localized initial condition @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the expected number of particles in the system where one particle starts at @xmath107 and branches binary according to the breeding potential @xmath109 .",
    "in particular in the case of time - independent iid random potential a detailed analysis of the behavior of solutions is possible ; we refer to the overview article @xcite . if @xmath109 is the white noise case , then ( [ pam2 ] ) is a particular case of ( [ int ] ) leading us to the next example .",
    "[ pam ] for @xmath113 , equation ( [ int ] ) describes the parabolic anderson model with brownian potential ( white noise potential ) .",
    "a detailed analytic study of the longtime behavior for this model can be found in the monograph @xcite .",
    "for the probabilistic approach based on an explicit feynman - kac representation we refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "finally , the simplest example should be mentioned .",
    "already in this case , a non - trivial interplay of noise and drift can be observed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "choosing @xmath114 , equation ( [ int ] ) describes interacting brownian motions .",
    "now , as we have discussed examples that are of very different nature in terms of their origins and also of their properties , we should explain the connections to mutually catalytic models .",
    "here is a preliminary definition for the two types interacting diffusion model introduced by etheridge / fleischmann in @xcite .",
    "a more precise and more general definition is given in section 2 .",
    "[ def1 ] in the following , weak solutions @xmath94 on a stochastic basis @xmath115 to the infinite system of stochastic differential equations defined in ( [ ss ] ) driven by brownian motions with correlation structure ( [ ss2 ] ) are called symbiotic branching processes with initial conditions @xmath96 , branching rate @xmath68 and correlation @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "+ to abbreviate , the system of equations ( [ ss ] ) and their solutions will be denoted by * @xmath117 * or just * @xmath118*.    the name symbiotic branching model was used in @xcite in order to stress the biological interpretation of the mutually catalytic behavior ; the solution processes @xmath119 and @xmath120 might be considered as the distribution in space of two types .    for later use",
    "let us capture the correlation structure used for symbiotic branching in a name .",
    "we will say that two brownian motions satisfying @xmath121=\\varrho t$ ] , @xmath24 , are @xmath34-correlated .",
    "having introduced the basic equations of this article , their relevance is emphasized by the following observation due to @xcite . for correlation @xmath122 ,",
    "solutions of the symbiotic branching model are solutions of the mutually catalytic branching model @xmath97 .",
    "+ the case @xmath40 with the additional assumption @xmath123 corresponds to the stepping stone model . to see this ,",
    "observe that in the perfectly negatively correlated case @xmath124 which implies that the sum @xmath125 solves a discrete heat equation and with the further assumption @xmath123 stays constant for all time .",
    "hence , for all @xmath24 , @xmath126 which shows that @xmath43 is a solution of the stepping stone model with initial condition @xmath127 and @xmath45 is a solution with initial condition @xmath128 .",
    "+ finally , suppose @xmath129 is a solution of the parabolic anderson model , then , for @xmath130 , the pair @xmath131 is a solution of the symbiotic branching model with initial conditions @xmath132 as now @xmath133 .      to motivate the procedure of sending @xmath7 to infinity in theorem [ 0 ] and to highlight for a first time why the generalized voter processes appear as limits , let us briefly discuss the voter process and its connection to the stepping stone model .",
    "for extensive information about interacting particle systems we refer to the monograph of liggett @xcite .",
    "a way of defining interacting particle systems is a description via infinitesimal generators . here",
    ", we assume that the voters live on @xmath13 and communicate only with their nearest neighbors . to define the dynamics via a generator ,",
    "the state - space @xmath134 is fixed .",
    "the generator acts via @xmath135 on test - functions @xmath136 only depending on finitely many coordinates and @xmath137 is defined to be the configuration in which the opinion is flipped only at site @xmath51 and the rate of change at site @xmath51 is proportional ( normalized to total rate @xmath42 ) to the number of neighbors with different opinion : @xmath138 interestingly , the analysis of the longtime behavior of a voter process is drastically simplified by a pathwise graphical construction ( see @xcite , page 129 ) : for each voter a vertical line is drawn downwards and each line carries a poisson process firing tacks on that line . at each tack , a horizontal line is drawn randomly to a neighbor . with an initial configuration @xmath139",
    ", the construction goes as follows : for each site @xmath51 with @xmath140 water is filled into the vertical line and disperses downwards .",
    "whenever there is an arrow pointing away from the line ( this corresponds to persuading a neighbor ) the water goes on downwards and , additionally , flows through the arrow to disperse downwards in the neighbor s line . when an arrow points from a neighbor s line towards the voter s line the water stops ( this corresponds to be persuaded by a neighbor ) .",
    "at time @xmath24 , the configuration @xmath141 is defined as follows : all sites filled by water carry a @xmath42 and al l others a @xmath107 .",
    "it is heuristically clear that this construction yields a markov process with generator ( [ gener ] ) but interestingly it simultaneously gives a useful dual relation : reversing time and using the same arrows in the opposite direction , the resulting process is a system of instantaneously coalescing random walks .",
    "a simple consequence of this construction is a moment formula for the voter process : @xmath142&={\\mathbb{e}}\\big[\\prod_i u_0(\\xi_t^i)\\,\\big|\\,\\xi^1_0=k_1,\\cdots,\\xi^m_0=k_m\\big ] ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 are independent simple random walks that coalesce instantaneously when colliding .",
    "the product runs over all non - coalesced random walks at time @xmath72 .",
    "+ now , let us return to the stepping stone model @xmath144 that was already identified to the symbiotic branching process s @xmath40 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct graphical construction for the stepping stone model , but still , a moment representation similar to ( [ mmm ] ) was derived in @xcite : suppose the @xmath145 are as above but now two particles coalesce when they have spent together an independent exponential time of rate @xmath7 .",
    "more precisely , suppose @xmath146 is a solution of ( [ bbbb ] ) with initial conditions @xmath147 .",

    "boundedness of solutions implies that convergence of the moments suffices to deduce convergence of the finite dimensional distributions so that the * infinite rate limit of the stepping stone model is nothing but the standard voter process*. for more on this we refer to section 10.3.1 of @xcite .",
    "the aim of this section is to give a compressed overview of definitions and results for symbiotic branching processes @xmath118 with finite branching rate . after introducing some notation , precise definitions and a sketch of existence and uniqueness proofs we turn our focus to the longtime behavior .",
    "let @xmath151 be the exit law of a pair of @xmath34-correlated brownian motions started in @xmath152 for some @xmath153 stopped at the exit - time @xmath154 the laws @xmath155 are concentrated on the boundary of the first quadrant which we denote by @xmath156 whenever the initial condition @xmath152 is not crucial we abbreviate the exit - law as @xmath157 .",

    "<S> we combine two approaches extending their ideas : the approach of adding correlations to the driving noise of the system is combined with the approach of obtaining new processes by letting the branching rate tend to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> the processes are considered on a countable site space . </S>",
    "<S> + we introduce infinite rate symbiotic branching processes which surprisingly can be interpreted as generalized voter processes with additional strength of opinions . </S>",
    "<S> since many of the arguments go along the lines of known proofs this article is written in the style of a review article .            </S>",
    "<S> [ multiblock footnote omitted ]    going back to the seminal work of watanabe @xcite and dawson @xcite , the subject of measure - valued diffusion processes arising as scaling limits of branching particle systems has attracted the interest of many probabilists . </S>",
    "<S> many tools had to be developed to study the fascinating properties of the dawson / watanabe process ( also called superprocess or super - brownian motion ) and its relatives . </S>",
    "<S> characterizations and constructions of the process via a laplace transform duality to non - linear parabolic partial differential equations , infinitesimal generator and corresponding martingale problem , the pathwise lookdown construction of donelly / kurtz @xcite , @xcite or le gall s brownian snake construction based on the ray - knight theorems ( see the overview @xcite ) led to many deep results . </S>",
    "<S> much of the analysis is based on the branching property , i.e. the sum of two independent super - brownian motions @xmath0 is equal in distribution to a single super - brownian motion started at @xmath1 .    in the early 90s </S>",
    "<S> further directions became popular . </S>",
    "<S> super - brownian motion was found to be a universal scaling limit not only of branching systems but also of interacting particle systems such as voter process and its modifications ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , instead of considering plainly super - brownian motion , interactions were introduced . </S>",
    "<S> tools such as dawson s generalized girsanov theorem @xcite have been successfully applied in various contexts . here , we will be mostly interested in variants of catalytic super - brownian motion , i.e. super - brownian motion with underlying branching mechanism depending on a catalytic random environment . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the environment is fixed , a good deal of the analysis can still be performed with techniques developed for the super - brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> more delicately , taking into account connections to stochastic heat equations , dawson / perkins introduced a mutually catalytic superprocess ( see @xcite ) . their mutually catalytic branching model on the continuous site space </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 consists of two super - brownian motions each being the catalyst of branching for the other . </S>",
    "<S> the model was described via stochastic heat equations . </S>",
    "<S> they considered @xmath3 driven by two independent white noises @xmath4 on @xmath5 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath6 denotes the one dimensional laplacian . </S>",
    "<S> the mutually catalytic interaction of two super - brownian motions has one particular drawback : the branching property is destroyed so that many of the previously known tools collapse . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , some ideas borrowed from the study of interacting particle systems and interacting diffusion models could be applied successfully due to the symmetric nature of the model . in particular , a self - duality that extends the linear system duality known for interacting particle systems could be established and utilized to prove uniqueness and longterm properties . besides the above continuous model , the mutually catalytic model on the lattice was constructed and studied by dawson and perkins as well .    </S>",
    "<S> this article , which is focused on spatial branching models on discrete space , is motivated by two recent developments . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the effect of sending the branching rate @xmath7 to infinity was studied in the discrete space mutually catalytic branching model . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting infinite rate mutually catalytic branching model is one of the rare tractable spatial models with finite @xmath8 moments but infinite @xmath9nd moment forcing the system to have critical scaling behavior . </S>",
    "<S> + secondly , etheridge / fleischmann @xcite introduced the following generalization of the dawson - perkins model . </S>",
    "<S> they considered the mutually catalytic branching model with correlated driving noises which , on the level of a branching system approximation , corresponds to a two type system of branching particles with correlated branching mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> they called their model symbiotic branching model in contrast to the mutually catalytic branching model of dawson / perkins that appears as a special case for zero correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we will use equally the name symbiotic branching and mutually catalytic branching with correlations . correlating </S>",
    "<S> the branching mechanism might seem artificial on first view . </S>",
    "<S> on second view one observes that the extremal correlations lead to well - known models from the theory of interacting diffusion models : the stepping stone model with applications in theoretical biology and a parabolic anderson model with applications in statistical physics . </S>",
    "<S> as those models have very different path behavior one could expect phase - transitions occurring when changing the correlations . on the level of moments those phase transitions have been revealed recently in @xcite : there is a precise transition for @xmath9nd moments when the correlation parameter changes from negative to positive .    </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this article , formulated here in a slightly simplified version , is the following theorem which should be viewed as the natural combination of the two aforementioned developments . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the theorem below extends results from @xcite to the case of `` correlated ( symbiotic ) branching '' .    [ 0 ] suppose @xmath10 is a parameter and @xmath11 is the unique non - negative weak solution to the symbiotic branching model on the lattice defined by @xmath12 here , @xmath6 denotes the discrete laplacian on @xmath13 @xmath14 and the driving gaussian process @xmath15 has correlation structure @xmath16&=\\delta_0(k - j)t,\\\\              { \\mathbb{e}}\\big[b^2_{t}(k)b^2_{t}(j)\\big]&=\\delta_0(k - j)t,\\\\              { \\mathbb{e}}\\big[b^1_{t}(k)b^2_{t}(j)\\big]&=\\varrho\\delta_0(k - j)t.\\end{split }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] additionally , assume that the non - negative initial conditions @xmath17 do not depend on @xmath7 , satisfy a minor growth condition ( for the precise definitions see  ( [ 111 ] ) and section  [ sec:2.1.1 ] ) and also @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath20 converges , as @xmath7 tends to infinity , weakly in the meyer - zheng  pseudo - path \" topology ( introduced in  @xcite ) , to a limiting rcll process @xmath21 taking values in @xmath22 which is the unique weak solution to the system of poissonian integral equations @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath19 . here , @xmath25 is a poisson point measure on @xmath26 with intensity measure @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 and , for any @xmath19 , @xmath30    theorem [ 0 ] will be proved in section [ sec:3 ] for more general countable state - space @xmath31 instead of @xmath13 and @xmath32-matrix @xmath33 instead of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of the theorem follows from theorems [ pro:1 ] and [ thm:111 ] </S>",
    "<S> .    the parameter @xmath34 only occurs in the measure @xmath35 so that it does not surprise that proofs go along the lines of @xcite replacing in their poissonian equations @xmath36 by some @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the striking fact of the generalization to @xmath38 is that it allows to understand @xmath39 as a family of generalized voter processes with the standard voter process appearing for @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> the generalized voter process interpretation goes as follows : suppose at each site @xmath19 lives a voter with one of two possible * opinions*. their opinions additionally have a non - negative * strength*. mathematically speaking , the type of opinion is determined by the non - zero coordinate of the opinion - vector ( recall the definition of @xmath22 ) and the strength is determined by the absolute value , i.e.    * @xmath41 codes opinion @xmath42 of strength @xmath43 , * @xmath44 codes opinion @xmath9 of strength @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> formulated like this , the standard voter process only takes values @xmath46 and @xmath47 since all opinions do have a fixed strength , say @xmath42 . if @xmath43 ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 ) is large , we say the opinion is strong , otherwise weak . + voters change dynamically their opinions and their strength according to the next two possibilities :    * * change of opinion strength only * : suppose @xmath48 has an atom at @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> then , by definition of the two integrands , the poissonian integrals produce two - dimensional jumps of the form @xmath50 so that , added to the current state of the system , the state of the system at site @xmath51 changes according to @xmath52 if before the jump the voter had opinion @xmath42 of strength @xmath43 , the change is @xmath53 and @xmath54 if the voter had opinion @xmath9 before . hence , if @xmath55 is chosen by the basic jump measure @xmath35 , only the strength of the opinion changes but not the type . </S>",
    "<S> * * change of opinion and its strength * : suppose @xmath48 has an atom at @xmath56 . then , by definition of the integrands , the poissonian integrals produce jumps of the form @xmath57 so that , added to the current state of the system , the state of the system at site @xmath51 changes according to @xmath58 if before the jump the voter had opinion @xmath42 of strength @xmath43 , the change is @xmath59 and @xmath60 if the voter had opinion @xmath9 before . hence , if @xmath61 is chosen by the basic jump measure @xmath35 , the voter changes strength and type of opinion .    </S>",
    "<S> we show in section [ sec : voter2 ] that theorem [ 0 ] extends naturally to @xmath40 when @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> if additionally @xmath63 , then solutions to ( [ uv ] ) give standard voter processes . note that in this case only the second type of changes occurs since @xmath48 only has atoms at @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the strength of the opinion does not change . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we only see opinion changes from @xmath46 to @xmath47 and vice versa </S>",
    "<S> .    finally , we should also give an interpretation to the rates @xmath65 : due to the definition of @xmath65 and @xmath6 , the rate of change for the voter at site @xmath51 is high if the strength of the opinions of his neighbors of different opinion is high compared to his opinion . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , voters with weak conviction tend to change quicker their opinions than voters with strong conviction .    </S>",
    "<S> the result of theorem [ 0 ] might look frightening to the reader not familiar with interacting diffusion processes and/or jump diffusions . </S>",
    "<S> however , once the connection to the results of @xcite and @xcite is understood , the proofs of the theorem go along the lines of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we decided to write this article in the form of a review article explaining in depth the background . </S>",
    "<S> we do not give many detailed proofs but instead give more detailed calculations to explain the origins of ( [ uv ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the following we explain carefully    * the background of catalytic branching processes , * definitions , existence , uniqueness and tools for ( [ ss ] ) , * what is known on the longtime behavior of ( [ ss ] ) to motivate the choice of @xmath35 in the theorem via planar brownian motions exiting a cone , * more details on ( [ uv ] ) and ( alternative ) constructions of @xmath39 , * concepts and definitions for jump diffusions .    </S>",
    "<S> the background and connections to well - known stochastic processes from the literature will be explained exhaustively in * section [ sec:1]*. two different routes from known models to mutually catalytic branching models are disclosed : the original motivation of dawson / perkins originating from catalytic super - brownian motion and symbiotic branching as unifying model for some interacting diffusions . as a final motivation </S>",
    "<S> the connection of stepping stone processes and voter processes is recalled . </S>",
    "<S> * section  [ sec:2 ] * is devoted to an overview of precise definitions , existence and uniqueness results and longtime properties for finite rate symbiotic branching processes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the second moment transitions are discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> proofs are cooked down to the main ingredients . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in * section [ sec:3 ] * the infinite rate symbiotic branching processes are introduced and reinterpreted as generalized voter processes in the very end . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a brief summary of jump diffusions is included to the appendix . </S>"
