    "the free - monomers impinge on the substrate at random locations and react on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit .",
    "polymer thin films grown by vdp are made up of long polymer chains formed through the polymerization reaction occurring during the growth process .",
    "the polymerization process involves the interaction of two free - monomer molecules in a chemical reaction to initiate a dimer ( polymer chain of length = 2 ) .",
    "the free - monomers moving towards the substrate are consumed by either of the two processes : first being chain initiation in which new polymer molecules are generated ; and secondly , chain propagation in which the existing polymer molecules are extended to higher molecular weight . besides these two mechanisms , the free - monomer adsorption , diffusion , and polymer merger can be considered as other mechanisms that determine the overall film morphology . the chemical nature of the linear polymer chain restricts the number of bonding sites .",
    "a free - monomer can only bond to either of the two active ends of a polymer , or to another free - monomer .",
    "this bonding constraint leads to the formation of an entangled or an overhang configuration , which blocks the region it covers from the access of other incoming free - monomers . in conventional physical vapor deposition ( pvd )",

    "proposed a stochastic growth model based on bulk diffusion @xcite , which correctly predicted the kinetic roughening phenomena observed in their experiment @xcite but lacks the details on how polymers evolve .",
    "insufficient theoretical studies coupled with inconsistencies in the experiments motivate us to model the polymer film growth and seek a better understanding of the growth processes that determine the roughening mechanism . in this paper , we study the 1 + 1d lattice model for the polymer films grown by vdp and examine the effects of random angle deposition , free - monomer diffusion , free - monomer adsorption in determining the evolution of the film s morphology .",

    "in our simulation , the free - monomers were deposited at random angles on a 1-d substrate of lattice size @xmath33 at a deposition rate @xmath0 ( in units of monomers per site per unit time ) . the kiss random number generator @xcite was employed and one deposition time unit corresponded to the deposition of @xmath33 free - monomers . the incident free - monomers were released from a height three lattice units above the highest point on the surface with an initial abscissa randomly chosen from @xmath34 .",
    "the depositing free - monomers have a uniform `` launch angle '' distribution which corresponds to a nonuniform flux distribution @xmath35 of particles above the surface , where @xmath36 is defined as the angle between the direction of impinging monomer and the substrate normal @xcite .",

    "the deposited free - monomers were allowed to diffuse via nearest - neighbor hops with a diffusion rate @xmath1 ( nearest neighbor hops per monomer per unit time ) . a free - monomer that is deposited on top of an existing polymer chain gets adsorbed on the chain and is also allowed to diffuse .",
    "the excluded volume constraint was implemented by rejecting the diffusion or deposition moves to an already occupied site . as the monomer coverage increases on the substrate , the polymer film grows along a direction perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "this `` two dimensional '' growth is often referred to as the 1 + 1d growth in literature .",

    "adsorbed free - monomers are allowed to diffuse along the adsorbent to any of the nearest - neighboring unoccupied sites with equal probability , the rate of diffusion @xmath1 is assumed to be the same on both the substrate and the polymer chain .",
    "we define the chain length @xmath37 of a polymer as the number of monomers forming a polymer chain .",
    "when an impinging free - monomer encounters another free - monomer on the substrate as its nearest neighbor ( process 3(a ) ) , both are frozen and undergo a chemical reaction to form a dimer ( polymer chain of length @xmath38 ) ; polymers with chain length @xmath39 can also be formed after deposition ( process 3(b ) ) .",
    "free - monomer diffusion along the substrate ( process 3(c ) ) and along the polymer chain ( process 3(d ) ) can also result in the polymer chain initiation @xcite .",
    "when an impinging free - monomer encounters the active end of a polymer chain , it attaches itself to the chain and increases the chain length by one unit ( 4(a ) , 4(b ) ) .",
    "a diffusing free - monomer can meet an active end of a polymer chain in its neighborhood and get bonded to that polymer chain ( process 4(c ) ) . in linear polymer systems ,",
    "the free - monomers are allowed to form a maximum of two chemical bonds and at any given time only the two ends of the polymer chain are chemically active , resulting in the chain propagation at these two end locations . the chain portion ( of the polymer ) excluding the two chemically active ends , is not allowed to form chemical bonds with neighboring free - monomers .",
    "free - monomers can however be physically adsorbed on the chain and can diffuse along the chain ( process 2(b ) ) .",
    "another interesting process that occurs during the film growth is the _ polymer - merger_. two different polymers can merge when their respective active - ends meet as nearest neighbors . during the polymer - merger ,",
    "the nearest neighboring ends of merging polymers react chemically to join the two polymers into one longer polymer chain with higher molecular weight .",
    "the resulting polymer chain is left with two active - ends , one from each of the parent polymers . in the case",
    "when both the active - ends belonging to the same chain appear as nearest neighbors , the chemical bond between the ends is prohibited . in this study",
    "we do not attempt to study the effects of re - emission which allows the free - monomers to `` bounce around '' before they settle at appropriate sites on the surface .",
    "instead , we assume that the impinging free - monomers will always stick to the particle that comes on its deposition path ( processes 4(a ) , 4(b ) ) . at each stage of the simulation , either a deposition or a diffusion",
    "is performed . in order to keep track of the competing rates of diffusion and deposition we adapted the method suggested by amar et al.@xcite and carried out the deposition with a probability @xmath40 , @xmath41 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the free - monomer density ( per site ) and @xmath2 .",

    "if a free - monomer encountered another free - monomer or an active end of a polymer as its nearest neighbor , it was added to the polymer chain and removed from the free - monomer list . in cases where a free - monomer was the nearest neighbor to the active ends of more than two polymers ,",
    "we selected a random pair of polymers and performed polymer - merger .",
    "in fig . [ fig_2_six_eps_figs_grey ] we show typical snapshots of the polymer films generated using @xmath33 = @xmath45 substrate for two extreme cases : @xmath4 = @xmath5 ( figs .",

    "the films show the presence of columnar structures , overhangs , and unoccupied regions .",
    "these structures were observed to persist throughout the growth process .",
    "presence of these morphological structures can be explained by the shadowing effect inherent in the growth process and is attributed to the cos@xmath47 distribution of the impinging free - monomer flux @xcite .",
    "shadowing effects arise when the columnar structures of the surface `` stick out '' and shadow their neighboring sites , thus inhibiting the growth in their neighboring sites . due to the angular flux distribution of the impinging free - monomers the taller surface features",

    "the free - monomers deposited on the film have a higher probability of encountering another impinging free - monomer as nearest neighbor and thereby initiating new polymers .",

    "in contrast , at a higher diffusion rate of @xmath4 = @xmath46 , the free - monomers have a higher probability to diffuse upward towards the growth front and the upward diffusion of free - monomers is favored due to the non - symmetric nature of the lattice potential associated with diffusion over a step @xcite .",
