    "observations have so far led to a large number of discovered high - mass x - ray binaries , both in the milky way and other galaxies ( over 100 in the milky way alone ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , only a handful of these are believed to harbor black holes .",
    "two of these , cygnus x-1 and cygnus x-3 , are found in our own galaxy .",
    "the most well - known and well - studied of the black hole binaries is cygnus x-1 .    in parallel with the discovery of more sources ,",
    "new techniques have given estimates of the spin parameter of the black hole .",
    "the two main techniques rely on spectral fitting of the thermal component ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or relativistically broadened iron line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , these results are quite sensitive as spectral fitting is prone to a certain amount of degeneracy and model dependency .",
    "the technique is also dependent on the spectral state of the source , making it difficult to apply to certain sources which do not show this state , e.g. cyg  x-1 .",
    "@xcite presented an alternative technique for determining the spin parameter in cyg  x-1 . by studying the evolution of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos )",
    ", they were able to give support to the idea that the oscillations are connected to the relativistic precession frequencies predicted by general relativity in the strong gravitational field close to the black hole . based on this identification ,",
    "the spin parameter was measured to be @xmath0 , assuming the black hole mass to be 9 . while still dependent on the theoretical interpretation , this method allows for a much more precise determination of the spin than the spectral modelling techniques .",
    "as several of the black hole systems discovered so far are tight systems , a possible source of spin may be tidal locking ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "upon collapse of the black hole progenitor , the angular momentum is preserved in the spin parameter of the black hole . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate whether such a scenario can explain the measured spin parameter of cyg  x-1 .",
    "this system is a good candidate for such an investigation : it is bright and thereby well studied , and observations by @xcite indicate that the mass loss in the formation of the black hole was low .    in the rest of this section , we motivate our choice for the system parameters such as the mass of the compact object .",
    "based on this , in the following section we investigate whether systems similar to cyg  x-1 can acquire sufficient angular momentum via tidal locking to explain the current spin parameter . in sect .",
    "[ evolution ] we discuss the evolution of the system in the past , including possible processes which may cause the spin measured today to differ from the natal one .",
    "although one of the best studied black hole candidate sources , estimates of the current parameters of the cyg  x-1 system vary .",
    "perhaps most well - determined is the mass function @xmath1 ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the masses of the compact object and companion star , respectively , and @xmath5 the inclination of the system .",
    "@xcite found @xmath6 .",
    "the mass function is often used to determine the mass of the compact object , and thus requires estimates of the inclination and companion mass .",
    "these parameters are however difficult to measure .",
    "several different methods have been used to estimate the mass of the donor . @xcite",
    "used the spectroscopic orbit , light curve , photospheric line broadening and an assumed degree of roche lobe filling to find a mass of @xmath7 , giving @xmath8 . from spectroscopic analysis of the line spectrum , @xcite derived mass estimates of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "observational and evolutionary constraints led @xcite to significantly higher mass estimates : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this wide range of masses illustrates the difficulties inherent in these indirect measurements of the black hole mass .",
    "recently , direct determination of the mass of the compact object has been suggested from measurements of the x - ray radiation .",
    "for example , @xcite study the correlation between low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and spectral index and determine the mass of the compact object to @xmath13 , which is a much stronger estimate than achieved by the indirect measurements above .    in this paper , we will use the value of @xmath14 .",
    "this range is in the lower end of the values found by studies of the donor star , but nevertheless compatible with both these measurements and the more direct mass estimates of the compact object .",
    "for the inclination , values from @xmath15 to @xmath16 have been suggested , with most falling in the lower end of the range .",
    "we will here use @xmath17@xmath18 , following @xcite .",
    "these values then give us the current system parameters , presented in table  [ partable ] .",
    ".table of parameter values used in this paper .",
    "the separation and donor mass ranges are calculated using the mass function with the assumed ranges of black hole mass and inclination .",
    "note that these ranges are not to be seen as confidence intervals in the traditional sense , but merely the values possible when @xmath3 and @xmath5 are allowed to vary over our chosen ranges . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from these values it is clear that cyg  x-1 is not an unusually tight system , nor is the spin parameter particularly high . the only other high - mass black hole binaries with spin estimates are lmc  x-1 and m33  x-7 , but in these cases the spin parameter is estimated from spectral fitting to be @xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 @xcite , respectively , which is much higher than in cyg  x-1 .",
    "such a high spin is highly unlikely to arise due to tidal locking alone .",
    "rather , it would appear that explaining the spin parameter in many of the other systems is an even greater challenge !",
    "the fact that all measured spins are quite high reduces the probability for a very peculiar evolutionary channel . in our view",
    ", it strengthens the case for a high spin being created during the stellar collapse , e.g. through asymmetric accretion .",
    "for example , it has been shown that a spherical accretion shock instability ( sasi ) can form in supernovae , leading to accretion of significant angular momentum @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the possibility for the spin of cygnus x-1 to result from the collapse of a stellar core , rapidly spinning through tidal locking .",
    "we find that such a scenario is not compatible with standard stellar evolution models ; the required orbit is so close that the companion star would not fit at zams .",
    "rotational mixing or alternative evolutionary paths do not offer a solution , nor is the black hole likely to have been spun up due to accretion .",
    "our conclusion is thus that the spin originates in the black hole formation event .",
