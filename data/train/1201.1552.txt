    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) have remained enigmatic since their discovery in the late 1960s ( for reviews , see piran 2004 ; zhang 2007 ) .",
    "although in the last ten years our understanding of grbs has been advanced significantly , due mainly to the study of grb afterglows ( e.g. , sari et al .",
    "1998 ; fan & wei 2005 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) , the exact mechanism which produces the prompt gamma - ray emission has not been definitively established ( e.g. , fan 2010 ; ghisellini 2010 ) .",
    "the temporal structures of the prompt emission are very complicated , consisting of many overlapping pulses .",
    "pulses are the basic , central building blocks of the prompt emission , and their correlative properties imply that the pulses are responsible for many luminosity - related characteristics .",
    "recent studies showed that the lag vs. luminosity relation ( norris et al .",
    "2000 ) , the variability vs. luminosity relation ( reichart et al . 2001 ) , the @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 relation ( amati et al . 2002 ) and the @xmath3 vs. @xmath5 relation ( wei & gao 2003 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) all seem to be better explained by pulse rather than bulk emission properties ( see , hakkila et al .",
    "2008 ; hakkila & cumbee 2009 ; krimm et al . 2009 ; firmani et al .",
    "2009 ; ohno et al .",
    "2009 ; ghirlanda , nava & ghisellini 2010 ; arimoto et al .",
    "2010 ) . in principle , the bulk characteristics of the prompt emission can be derived from our knowledge of the decomposition of the burst in pulses and their individual properties . therefore , it is essential to our understanding of the physics of the bulk prompt emission of grbs , that we properly measure and understand the properties of the individual pulses .",
    "hakkila et al .",
    "( 2008 ) isolated and delineated pulse spectral properties of grbs detected by batse with known redshifts , and found that pulse lag , pulse luminosity , and pulse duration are strongly correlated .",
    "they also found that pulse peak lag , pulse asymmetry , and pulse hardness are correlated for a large number of pulses of long grbs ( hakkila & cumbee 2009 ) .",
    "these results indicate that most pulses of long grbs within a given burst as well as when comparing different bursts might have similar physical origins .",
    "however , in some cases , which show two or more separated distinct emission episodes , and each emission episode consists of one or more pulses , their pulse properties and origins are likely complicated .",
    "for example , hakkila & giblin ( 2004 ) identified two cases ( grbs 960530 and 980125 ) , consisting of two separated emission episodes , and found that the pulses in the second emission episodes of these two grbs have longer lags , smoother morphologies , and softer spectral evolution than those in the first episodes .",
    "it has been suggested that internal- and external - shock emission might overlap in these two cases ( hakkila & giblin 2004 ) .",
    "recently , the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) detected a burst , grb 090618 , which shows two emission episodes with four prominent pulses ( baumgartner et al .",
    "it is obvious that the pulse in the first episode has a smoother morphology than the three pulses in the second episode .",
    "we wonder whether the pulses in the two emission episodes within this burst have different properties and/or origins . to this end",
    ", we have performed a detailed analysis of the pulse temporal and spectral characteristics of grb 090618 ( preliminary results are reported in zhang 2011 ) .",
    "grb 090618 was detected by swift - bat at 08:28:29 ut on 2009 june 18 ( this time is used as @xmath6 throughout the paper , schady et al .",
    "the burst was also observed by fermi - gbm ( mcbreen et al .",
    "2009 ) , agile ( longo et al . 2009 ) , suzaku wam ( kono et al . 2009 ) , konus - wind and konus - rf ( golenetskii et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ) began follow up observations of its x - ray light curve 124 s after the bat trigger and its uvo telescope detected its optical afterglow 129 s after the trigger ( schady et al .",
    "absorption features which were detected in its bright optical afterglow with the 3 m shane telescope at lick observatory yielded a redshift of @xmath7 ( cenko et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the bat burst light curve shows a smooth multipeak structure with 4 prominent pulses .",
    "significant spectral evolution was observed during the burst .",
    "the spectrum at the maximum count rate , measured from @xmath6 + 62.720 to @xmath8 s , was well fitted ( golenetskii et al .",
    "2009 ) in the 20 kev@xmath92 mev range by the band function ( band et al .",
    "1993 ) with a low - energy photon index @xmath10 , a high energy photon index @xmath11 , and peak energy @xmath12 kev , while the time integrated spectrum had a low - energy photon index @xmath13 , a high energy photon index @xmath14 , and a peak energy @xmath15 kev ( golenetskii et al .",
    "the isotropic equivalent energy in the 8@xmath91000 kev band was @xmath16 erg ( standard cosmology , mcbreen et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the bat and gbm light curves over the standard energy bins ( bat : 15@xmath925 , 25@xmath950 , 50@xmath9100 and 100@xmath9350 kev ; gbm : 8@xmath91000 kev ( nai ) and 0.2@xmath930 mev ( bgo ) ) .",
    "the first episode ( episode a ) is a smooth 50 s pulse starting at @xmath17 s , and ends at @xmath18 s ( pulse a ) .",
    "the second episode ( episode b ) starts at @xmath19 s and is about 275 s long , consisting of three overlapping pulses .",
    "the first pulse peak at @xmath20 s ( pulse b1 ) , the second peak is at @xmath21 s ( pulse b2 ) , and the third peak is at @xmath22 s , finally ending at @xmath23 s ( pulse b3 ) .",
    "@xmath24 ( 15@xmath9350 kev ) is @xmath25 s ( estimated error including systematics , baumgartner et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we focus attention on how the pulse width and pulse width ratio depend on energy in the two emission episodes , while checking if that dependence is maintained during this burst .    ]",
    "kocevski et al . ( 2003 ) developed an empirical expression , which can be used to fit the pulses of grbs .",
    "this function can be written as , @xmath26^{-\\frac{r+d}{r+1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the time of the maximum flux ( @xmath28 ) of the pulse , @xmath29 is the offset time , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the rising and decaying power - law indices , respectively . because the prompt emission of grb 090618 is concentrated mainly in the swift - bat energy range , only the bat light curves are considered .",
    "we fit all the light curves ( see figure 1 ) of the burst in the different bat energy bands with equation ( 1 ) and then measure the values of pulse - width ( @xmath0 ) and the rise - to - decay ratio of pulse ( @xmath1 , pulse asymmetry ) . the errors of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are derived from simulations by assuming a normal distribution of the errors of the fitting parameters .",
    "the reported errors are at @xmath32 confidence level .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another observed effect of the spectral evolution in grb data is spectral lag .",
    "spectral lags are energy - dependent delays in the grb temporal structure .",
    "pulse peak lags are defined as the differences between the pulse peak times in different energy channels , which can be obtained for any pulse between two energy channels ( e.g. , norris et al . 2005 ; liang et al .",
    "2006 ; hakkila et al . 2008 ; zhang et al . 2007 ;",
    "zhang 2008 ) .",
    "in general , soft pulses lag behind hard pulses .",
    "the pulse peak - fit method gives a simple straightforward way for extracting lags ( norris et al .",
    "2005 ; hakkila et al .",
    "the pulse spectral lags between the four standard bat energy bands ( see table 1 ) are displayed in table 3 .",
    "we find that the pulse a of grb 090618 has a very longer lag ( in all energy channel combinations ) than all three pulses in the episode b. using the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) analysis method , page et al .",
    "( 2011 ) analyzed the whole spectral lags in the two episodes of grb 090618 and found that the episode a have a lag about a factor of 6 longer than for the episode b. their result is consistent with our finding , although the episode b of grb 090618 comprises three pulses .",
    "a similar phenomenon was also obtained by hakkila & giblin ( 2004 ) .",
    "the early studies of burst spectral lags show that they vary within a given burst as well as from burst to burst ( e.g. , norris 2002 ; ryde et al .",
    "2005 ; chen et al .",
    "multi - lag grbs are ubiquitous .",
    "therefore , we can not differentiate between their physical origins by only taking into account the spectral lags .",
    "vs. pulse peak lag @xmath33 for fit pulses of batse grbs having known redshifts ( the data are taken from hakkila et al . 2008 , grb 980425 is excluded ) as well as grb 090618 .",
    "_ right _ : isotropic pulse peak luminosity @xmath34 vs. pulse peak lag @xmath33 for the pulses shown in the left panel .",
    "the open circles represent the pulses from grb 971214 , grb 980703 , grb 970508 , grb 990510 , grb 991216 and grb 990123 , and the filled square represent grb 090618 .",
    "the solid lines are the best fits obtained by hakkila et al .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    in this work we have used the pulse peak - fit method to analyze the pulse temporal and spectral characteristics of grb 090618 . we find that the pulses in the two emission episodes have different properties , including the energy dependence of pulse widths and the pulse asymmetries , the pulse spectral evolution patterns as well as the pulse lags .",
    "the different pulse temporal and spectral characteristics exhibit simultaneously in one single grb , indicating there might be different origins in the different emission episodes of some grbs .",
    "none of the mechanisms proposed so far can be used to account for this fact .",
    "recently , hakkila et al . ( 2008 ) and hakkila and cumbee ( 2009 ) found that isotropic pulse peak luminosity ( @xmath34 ) , rest frame pulse peak lag ( @xmath33 ) , and pulse duration ( @xmath35 ) are correlated intrinsic properties of most grb pulses , and argued that most pulses might result from variations on a single pulse type . to further understand the different pulse properties , we also calculated the values of @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath35 for all pulses in grb 090618 and compare their relations with the hakkila et al .",
    "( 2008 ) result ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we find that the distributions of @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath35 for the four pulses basically comply with the relations found by hakkila et al .",
    "such a result renders the interpretation of the different pulse temporal and spectral properties found in our earlier analysis much more challenging . the first episode is dimmer than the second episode and",
    "may be identified as a precursor of the burst .",
    "a precursor could either have the same origin as the main emission episode or it could be due to a different mechanism ( see , koshut et al .",
    "1995 ; lazzati 2005 ; burlon et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "recently , penacchioni et al . ( 2011 ) proposed that grb 090618 might be a members of a specific new family of grbs presenting a double astrophysical component .",
    "a first one , related to the proto - black hole , prior to the process of gravitational collapse ( episode a ) and a second one which is the canonical grb ( episode b ) emitted during the formation of the black - hole .",
    "better measurements are needed in order to improve our understanding of grb pulse properties .",
    "description and analysis of pulse properties can help to constrain physical models .",
    "the similar time evolution of pulse structures , combined with the fact that their measurable properties correlate strongly , suggests that one physical mechanism produces the observed array of pulse characteristics ( see hakkila et al .",
    "2008 ; hakkila & cumbee 2009 ) .",
    "there is strong evidence that the majority of grb pulses results from internal shocks in relativistic winds ( e.g. sari & piran 1997 ; kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ; ramirez - ruiz & fenimore 2000 ; nakar & piran 2002 ) .",
    "katz ( 1994 ) suggested that grb pulse shapes originate from time delays inherent in the geometry of spherically expanding emission fronts .",
    "liang et al . ( 1997 ) argued that saturated compton up - scattering of softer photons may be the dominant physical mechanism that creates the shape of grb pulses .",
    "according to ryde and petrosian ( 2002 ) , the simplest scenario accounting for the observed grb pulses is to assume an impulsive heating of the leptons and their subsequent cooling and emission .",
    "in addition , in the impulsive external shock model , a single relativistic wave of plasma interacts with inhomogeneities in the surrounding medium and form external shocks that accelerate particles which can also contribute to the formation of grb pulses ( dermer et al . 1999 ) .",
    "although many studies have been performed to interpret the pulse characteristics , their nature is still unclear .",
