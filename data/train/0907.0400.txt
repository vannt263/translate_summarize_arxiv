    "<S> compounds containing magnetic subsystems representing simple model spin systems with weak magnetic coupling constants are ideal candidates to test theoretical predictions for the generic behavior close to quantum phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we present measurements of the thermal expansion and magnetostriction of the spin-@xmath0-chain compound copper pyrazine dinitrate cu(c@xmath1h@xmath1n@xmath2)(no@xmath3)@xmath2 . of particular interest </S>",
    "<S> is the low - temperature thermal expansion close to the saturation field @xmath4 , which defines a quantum phase transition from the gapless luttinger liquid state to the fully saturated state with a finite excitation gap . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a sign change of the thermal expansion for the different ground states , and at the quantum critical point @xmath5 the low - temperature expansion approaches a @xmath6 divergence . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our data agree very well with the expected quantum critical behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> copper pyrazine dinitrate cu(c@xmath1h@xmath1n@xmath2)(no@xmath3)@xmath2 ( or cupzn ) crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with lattice constants @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , space group @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the structure consists of linear cu - pyrazine - cu - chains along the @xmath11 axis . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by zero - field susceptibility and specific heat measurements it could be shown , that cupzn is a @xmath12 chain with an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) intrachain exchange constant of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite recent zero - field muon - spin relaxation measurements provide evidence for long - range magnetic order below @xmath14 , which implies a ratio of interchain to intrachain coupling of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this means , that the spin chains are well isolated from each other and cupzn very well realizes the model of a one - dimensional spin-1/2 heisenberg chain antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical model is of particular interest because it represents a so - called spin luttinger liquid ( ll ) with a continuous two - spinon excitation spectrum . for a finite magnetoelastic coupling , however , </S>",
    "<S> any afm spin-1/2 chain is expected to show a spin - peierls transition , which transforms the ll to a dimerized phase with a finite excitation gap . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , the magnetoelastic coupling in cupzn is low enough to prevent such a spin - peierls transition for @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath17 , cupzn is ideally suited for experimental studies of the ll state over a wide range of temperature and due to the relatively low value of @xmath18 it also allows one to study the magnetic - field influence over a wide field range . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - temperature quantum phase transition from the ll phase to the fully spin - polarized high - field phase with a finite spin gap is expected to occur at @xmath19  t , which is accessible in typical superconducting laboratory magnets . </S>",
    "<S> on approaching this quantum critical point , highly anomalous temperature dependencies of various thermodynamic properties are expected  @xcite and have been observed recently in the related spin-1/2-ladder compound ( c@xmath20h@xmath21n)@xmath2cubr@xmath1 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in this report , we present high - resolution measurements of the thermal expansion @xmath22 and the magnetostriction in magnetic fields up to 17  t. for both zero field , as well as the quantum critical field , our data well agree with the theoretical expectations , namely @xmath23 scales with the calculated magnetic specific heat while for the critical field it shows a power - law divergence @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) magnetostriction @xmath25 and ( b ) its field derivative @xmath26 measured along the spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) determination of @xmath27 via a linear extrapolation of the peak positions ( @xmath28 ) of @xmath29 and the points ( @xmath30 ) where @xmath22 changes sign ( see text).,title=\"fig : \" ] ( a ) magnetostriction @xmath25 and ( b ) its field derivative @xmath26 measured along the spin chains . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) determination of @xmath27 via a linear extrapolation of the peak positions ( @xmath28 ) of @xmath29 and the points ( @xmath30 ) where @xmath22 changes sign ( see text).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the magnetostriction and thermal expansion was measured in a home - built capacitance dilatometer , which is attached to a @xmath31 insert ( @xmath32  mk ) of a @xmath33 bath cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet ( @xmath34  t ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dilatometer can be rotated with respect to the magnetic - field axis such that the field can be aligned in any angle with respect to the measured uniaxial length change @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> for magnetostriction ( thermal expansion ) measurements @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is kept fixed while @xmath37 ( @xmath36 ) is continuously varied . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is measured with respect to the length at @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 is the total length of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the derivatives @xmath26 and @xmath42 are obtained numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the sample studied here is from the same batch as those used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the length changes parallel to the spin chains , i.e.  parallel to the @xmath11 axis , on a crystal with @xmath43  mm and the perpendicular dimensions @xmath44  </S>",
    "<S> mm@xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field was oriented along the @xmath46 axis , which has the largest @xmath47 factor ( @xmath48  @xcite ) in order to minimize the critical field @xmath49  </S>",
    "<S> t.    figure[msa](a ) shows the magnetostriction at various temperatures as a function of field , which strongly resembles the behaviour of the low - temperature magnetization @xcite . with increasing field the sample </S>",
    "<S> continuously elongates and finally reaches a plateau above the saturation field . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , this magnetostriction can be explained as follows : as the magnetic field forces the spins to orient parallel , the lattice distorts in a way to decrease the afm coupling @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the cost in exchange energy , but causes an additional cost in elastic energy . </S>",
    "<S> because , in lowest order , the first ( second ) term is linear ( quadratic ) in the distortion , such a magnetostriction always occurs . in the present case , @xmath18 is minimized by increasing the distance between neighboring spins , which appears rather natural , but there are also cases where the magnetostriction has the opposite sign  @xcite . the uniaxial pressure dependence of @xmath18 is related to the saturation value of the magnetostriction @xmath50 via @xmath51 . here , @xmath52 means pressure along @xmath11 , @xmath53 is the field - induced change of the spin corellator and @xmath54  @xmath55 is the volume per formula unit .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this yields @xmath56  % /gpa .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure[msa](b ) the field derivative @xmath57 has a rather sharp peak , which systematically broadens and shifts towards lower field with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the peak positions are plotted as a function of temperature in figure[msa](c ) and a linear fit extrapolates to the zero - temperature critical field @xmath49  </S>",
    "<S> t. this method to determine the qcp has already been used in the spin - ladder system ( c@xmath20h@xmath21n)@xmath2cubr@xmath1 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite     thermal expansion along the spin chains measured in @xmath39 and @xmath58  t ; note the logarithmic @xmath36 scale in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line in ( a ) is the sum of the scaled magnetic specific heat of a heisenberg chain ( dashed ) and a phononic @xmath59 term ( see text).,title=\"fig : \" ]   thermal expansion along the spin chains measured in @xmath39 and @xmath58  t ; note the logarithmic @xmath36 scale in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line in ( a ) is the sum of the scaled magnetic specific heat of a heisenberg chain ( dashed ) and a phononic @xmath59 term ( see text).,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure[tad](a ) displays the zero - field @xmath60 showing a maximum around 6k and a strong increase above 11k . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is the phononic thermal expansion ( @xmath61 ) , while the maximum is of magnetic origin ( @xmath62 ) . as the heisenberg chain contains only one energy scale @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> a grneisen scaling between the magnetic contribution @xmath63 of the specific heat and @xmath62 is expected , i.e.  @xmath64  @xcite . using the result of @xmath65 for the heisenberg chain  @xcite , and assuming the usual @xmath66 of acoustic phonons , we can model the measured thermal expansion @xmath67 by adjusting @xmath68 and @xmath69 as free parameters . with @xmath70  % /gpa and @xmath71 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the solid line in figure[tad](a ) , which nicely describes the experimental data up to 20  k and the corresponding @xmath72 is given by the dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the low - temperature expansion @xmath73  k ) of cupzn is of almost purely magnetic origin . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that this pressure dependence amounts only to about 2/3 of the value obtained from the magnetostriction data , is most likely due to the uncertainty of the phononic background , but does not affect the following discussion  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure[tad](b ) gives an overview of the thermal expansion data up to 15  t. with increasing field the maximum of @xmath74 shifts to lower temperature and above 10  t its amplitude increases on further approaching the critical field @xmath49  </S>",
    "<S> t. for a slightly higher field of 14  t , however , the thermal expansion is completely different ; @xmath75 is negative in the entire low-@xmath36 range and monotonically decreases down to the lowest temperature . for an even higher field of 15  t </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath75 finally shows a minimum around 1  k.    figure[tadtt ] gives a detailed view on the field region around the qcp . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in panel  ( a ) , the @xmath75 curves systematically change their curvature from an upward to a downward bending when the magnetic field is increased from 13.3  t to 14.1  t. from this figure alone , the location of the qcp is not obvious . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that only the @xmath75 curves for @xmath76  t show a sign change as a function of @xmath36 ; see also figure[tad](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the points where @xmath77 match the line obtained from the maximum positions of the @xmath78 curves , see figure[msa](c ) , and thus their linear extrapolation to zero temperature also yields @xmath49  t. for @xmath79  t , the @xmath75 curves show minima , whose positions shift to higher @xmath36 with increasing field ; see figure[tadtt](b ) . in figure[tadtt](c ) , we compare the three curves closest to the qcp on double - logarithmic scales . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a power - law fit of the 13.9  t curve is shown , which yields @xmath80 , in almost perfect agreement with the expected @xmath6 divergence .     </S>",
    "<S> thermal expansion along the spin chains for fields close to @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the line in ( c ) is a power - law fit yielding @xmath80 ( see text ) . ]    from the above analysis , one may expect the occurrence of sign changes ( minima ) in @xmath22 at temperatures below our minimum @xmath36 for the curves measured in fields between @xmath82 and 13.7  t ( 14.2  t ) . because of the afm ordering , however , this behaviour will be definitely cut off at @xmath14 , as it has been also observed in ( c@xmath20h@xmath21n)@xmath2cubr@xmath1  @xcite . in any real material , </S>",
    "<S> the question how well defined the qcp is , will depend on such imperfections and also on the sample quality . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , however , due to a magnetic correction of the elastic moduli the quantum critical behavior may be cut off even in a perfect sample at low enough temperature by a first - order phase transition .    in conclusion , we have measured the low - temperature magnetostriction and the thermal expansion along the spin-1/2 chain direction of cu(c@xmath1h@xmath1n@xmath2)(no@xmath3)@xmath2 up to magnetic fields strong enough to induce the quantum phase transition from the luttinger liquid phase to the fully spin - polarized state . </S>",
    "<S> using a grneisen relation , our zero - field expansion data are well described by the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain hamiltonian . with increasing field </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data follow the behaviour expected on approaching a quantum critical point . in particular , we observe the expected sign change and the @xmath6 divergence of the thermal expansion .    </S>",
