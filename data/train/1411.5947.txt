    "the neutrino was introduced for the first time by pauli in 1930 as a solution for the beta - decay spectrum .",
    "initially considered as a massless particle , during the period from 1990 to 2006 especially the sno @xcite and the superk @xcite oscillation experiments proved that neutrinos change their flavor when traveling from the source to the detector .",
    "this property was already known in the quark sector and happens only if the particles involved do have mass .",
    "the existence of massive neutrinos has been introduced within extensions of the standard model .",
    "two types of neutrino masses are allowed , the dirac and the majorana ones . in the majorana case neutrinos and",
    "their anti - particles are the same . + the investigation of the neutrino s nature is one of the most active fields in modern neutrino physics .",
    "the search of the majorana nature of neutrinos is done in the double - beta - decay ( dbd ) experiments @xcite .",
    "the dbd is a nuclear process where the z number changes by 2 units while the atomic mass , a , does not change .",
    "it happens only if the single beta decay transition is forbidden or strongly suppressed .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana particles , the decay can proceed without the emission of the 2 neutrinos .",
    "the result is the presence of a peak at the q - value of the reaction in the sum energy spectrum of the two electrons .",
    "+ there are about 35 candidates nuclei for the dbd searches .",
    "the quantity extracted from the number of events in the peak is the half - life of the decay .",
    "the expected value for the neutrinoless double beta decay half life is larger than 10@xmath4 years . to search for such a rare event a large mass ( volume ) , a very low background environment and a good knowledge of the backgrounds in the detector are necessary . +",
    "a possible source of background is the activation of the candidate material through spallation reaction induced by cosmogenic neutrons and protons during handling on surface .",
    "a study of the cosmogenic - induced isotopes has been done for several double beta decay experiments , like gerda @xcite and cuore @xcite , in order to define the maximum allowed exposure on surface , the necessary shielding during transportation , the necessary purification factors , and the cooling down time underground ( ug ) to reduce the cosmogenic background to a negligible level .",
    "+ in this article the studies are focused on a natural tellurium target .",
    "@xmath0te is the candidate nucleus chosen by the cuore and the sno+ collaborations for the search for the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "@xmath0te has a high natural isotopic abundance of 34.08% and a relative high q - value of 2.53 mev .",
    "the cuore collaboration will use tellurium in form of crystals ( teo@xmath1 ) cooled at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "the energy resolution of the crystals is nearly 57kev ( fwhm ) at 2.53mev @xcite .",
    "the cosmogenic - induced isotopes identified as possible background by the collaboration are @xmath5co , @xmath6sb and @xmath7ag .",
    "the calculated exposure time at sea level for the te crystals in @xcite was 4 months , followed by 2 years of storage underground .",
    "+ the sno+ experiment will use a tellurium loaded liquid scintillator to search for neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the tellurium acid ( te(oh)@xmath8 ) is dissolved in the liquid scintillator using water and a surfactant @xcite .",
    "the sno+ energy resolution is expected to be worse than the cuore one .",
    "an energy resolution of 220270kev ( fwhm ) at 2.53mev can be estimated using the 200300pe / mev as in @xcite .",
    "the actual resolution of the sno+ experiment will depend on the final composition of the scintillator cocktail .",
    "due to the worse energy resolution than bolometer experiments a larger number of cosmogenic - induced background nuclides can possibly fall in the energy region where the 0@xmath9 is expected .",
    "+ the identification of all potential backgrounds contributing in the 0@xmath9 energy region is extremely important to claim a discovery .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to find potential cosmogenic - induced background candidates for te - based experiments . for each isotope",
    "the production rate is calculated .",
    "the actual danger level of the identified candidates should be evaluated by the different experiments depending on the energy resolution , the target background level in the region of interest and the specific exposure and cooling down time .",
    "the list of potential background candidates , for the double beta decay search in te - based experiment , has been obtained searching into the table of isotopes ( toi)@xcite for candidates that match the following criteria :    * t@xmath3 20 days .",
    "shorter lived isotopes are generally considered to be removed by a cooling down time of few months .",
    "a cooling down time of about 6 months will reduce the initial activity of at least a factor 560 for a 20 days lived isotope .",
    "shorter lived isotopes are considered when fed by a long - lived parent . *",
    "q - value larger than 2 mev . for internal backgrounds",
    "both bolometer and scintillator experiments measure the total energy released in the decay ( beta and gammas ) .",
    "the q - value of the reaction is then an important criterion to select potential background isotopes . for an energy resolution of about 250 kev ( fhwm ) isotopes with q - value larger than 2.3 mev can potentially fall in the 0@xmath9 region . to account for a possible worse resolution",
    "a minimum of 2mev has been chosen . *",
    "mass number , a , smaller than @xmath10i , since the isotopes are supposed to be produced by spallation reactions on te .",
    "isotopes with higher mass number can be produced only if contaminations are present in the target material .    in some cases ,",
    "isotopes are both directly produced in the reaction , and fed by the decay of a long - lived parent also produced in the target material . if the half - life of the daughter is much shorter than the parent one ,",
    "secular equilibrium is assumed .",
    "otherwise , both contributions are taken into account .",
    "this is for instance the case for @xmath11y that can be directly produced in spallation reactions , but also fed by the decay of @xmath11zr .",
    "the identified isotopes are summarized in table [ tab::isotopes ] .",
    "the t@xmath12 , q - value and the decay mode are shown .",
    "the decay branching ratio ( br ) is listed in brackets when different from 100% .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this article the production rate for cosmogenic - induced isotopes on a natural tellurium target has been calculated .",
    "an extensive set of isotopes with q - value larger than 2 mev and t@xmath12 larger than 20 days has been considered as potential background candidates .",
    "in addition , the production rates of shorter lived and low q - value isotopes close in atomic mass to tellurium have been studied .",
    "high event rates can produce pile - up background .",
    "production rates are obtained with the help of the activia code for _",
    "_ e__@xmath13100mev and the neutron and proton cross section library for 10mev@xmath14__e__@xmath14200mev when available .",
    "the standard flux parametrization used is from @xcite@xcite .",
    "variation in the production rates are expected when different flux parametrizations or different cross section libraries are used .",
    "changes up to 200% have been estimated .",
    "the expected number of events per tonne of material has been calculated for two cooling down scenarios after one year of activation at sea level . in order to reduce the cosmogenic - induced background after one year of exposure to a negligible level for a kilotonne scintillator based experiment",
    "it would be desirable to have an initial purification followed by cooling down time ug to remove the short lived isotopes .",
    "+ the estimated in - situ underground activation due to muon induced neutrons for the long - lived , high q - value isotopes at the snolab location , 2 km underground , is less than 1 event/(yr@xmath15 t ) .",
    "the work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) .",
