    "since pne are important for the c enrichment of the interstellar medium , a successful chemical evolution model for the solar vicinity and the galactic disk ( carigi 2000 ) is used to discriminate between the pn - c abundances derived from permitted lines and the pn - c abundances obtained from forbidden lines .",

    "( 2002 ) for 217 kpc .",
    "the computed c / o gradient for 410 kpc is closer to that obtained from regions than to that determined from b - stars located between 217 kpc .    since in the literature there are c values based on recombination lines only for m17 , m8 and orion , i pay attention to the chemical evolution of the galactic disk only for 4 kpc @xmath15 10 kpc .",
    "the observed rise of c / o with time or metallicity in the solar vicinity is indicated by dwarf stars located closer than 1 kpc around the sun ( gustafsson et al .",
    "1999 ) and by the average solar value from allende - prieto et al .",

    "based on the classification by peimbert ( 1978 ) , in this work i assume that type i pn progenitors are stars with initial mass between 2.4 and 8 m@xmath16 , and type ii and iii pn progenitors are stars with initial mass between 0.8 and 2.4 m@xmath16 .",
    "the c yields for pn progenitors are calculated based on the average ( c / h)@xmath17 from permitted lines ( c@xmath18 yields ) and forbidden lines ( c@xmath19 yields ) , neglecting the ejected mass by winds and assuming that the average ( c / h)@xmath17 values are independent of the initial metallicity and mass of the progenitors .    based on the previous assumptions , the total ejected mass ( @xmath20 ) is the same as the mass ejected by the pn event and the stellar yield of the element @xmath21 , @xmath22 , can be written as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the mass of the pn progenitor in the main sequence , @xmath25 is the abundance by mass of the element @xmath21 determined in the planetary nebula , and @xmath26 is the initial stellar abundance or the abundance of the molecular nebula where the pn progenitor was formed .",
    "therefore , the c yield for pn progenitors as a function of the observed average ( c / h ) ratio is    @xmath27    the @xmath20 values and the corresponding h yields for pn progenitors are taken from van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 are computed by the chemical evolution code .",
    "since @xmath30 is independent of the pn progenitor metallicity , @xmath31 depends only on the initial stellar @xmath32 through @xmath33 , @xmath20 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; this dependence is very weak .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 is less dependent than the theoretical yields on the initial stellar mass , because @xmath30 is assumed to have a unique value for pni progenitors and another value for pnii / iii ones .",
    "i assume that the o yields for pn progenitors are null",
    ".    average ( c / h)@xmath18 and ( c / h)@xmath19 values are computed from 15 type i pne ( pni ) , and from 21 type ii and iii pne ( pnii / iii ) . the average ( c / h)@xmath34 is calculated from the @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 values given by peimbert et al .",

    "those yields derived from the permitted lines are in good agreement with the theoretical yields for high @xmath32 values , while the yields from forbidden lines are smaller that the theoretical ones for high @xmath32 values and agree with the theoretical ones for @xmath45 .",
    "the observational yields have been used to compute chemical evolution models .",
    "note that due to the small number of observational points the adopted yields are independent of @xmath46 and consequently independent of @xmath32 .",
    "this assumptions will be tested .",
    "models based on the observational yields will be confronted with the observations , and as i will show further on , it is necessary to assume models where the yields increase with metallicity to obtain a very good agreement with the observations .",
    "it has been possible to determine the initial mass of the stellar progenitor for two planetary nebulae : ngc 2818 and ngc 2346 , which belong to a globular cluster and a binary system , respectively ( dufour 1984 , peimbert & serrano 1980 ) .",

    "( 2002 ) , the large discrepancy between ( c / h)@xmath47 and ( c / h)@xmath48 may be caused by cold and extra - metal - rich condensations of very low mass and high density , embedded in the hot and diluted material of pne .",
    "the c ii @xmath49 4267 is emitted in these cold regions and the pne abundances determined from this line are not representative of the ejected material .",
    "if this idea is correct , the c@xmath19 yields are more realistic than the c@xmath18 yields .    according to torres - peimbert & peimbert ( 2002 ) in addition to the idea of chemical inhomogeneities , there are six other possible causes for the observed differences between the abundances derived from fl and pl : shadowed regions , density variations , deposition of mechanical energy , deposition of magnetic energy , dust heating , and decrease of the ionizing flux with time",
    ". if a combination of these six mechanisms is responsible of the abundance differences , then the c@xmath18 yields are more realistic than the c@xmath19 ones .",

    "the same results that are shown in figure 3 can be noted among @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and theoretical yields , but in this case , models based on the @xmath51 yields deviate from the c / o values observed in the three regions by 1.3 , 1.8 and 1 @xmath52 .    in table 1",
    "the predicted gradients at the present time are shown . by comparing observed and predicted values",
    ", it can be noted that : the c / h gradient is reproduced by all models , but the c / o gradient is reproduced only by the models that assume geneva yields , again confirming the conclusion of carigi ( 2000 ) .",
    "the c and o ejected ( processed and not processed by stars ) to the ism during the whole evolution of the solar vicinity are presented in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "massive stars produce the greater part of o and eject between 52 and 64 % of c. lims do not synthesize o and eject between 34 and 46 % of c.    liang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , concluded that in the late stage of evolution of the solar vicinity lims and metal - rich wolf rayet stars eject an important amount of carbon , but they were not able to distinguish which of these two groups of stars is the main source of carbon .",
    "based on our models , i conclude that c enrichment in the late stage of galactic evolution is mainly due to massive stars .    to analyze further the properties of the models i decided to use the c / o versus o / h diagram . in figure 5 ,",
    "i present the solar vicinity models for the seven sets of yields used in this paper .",
    "i have divided the evolution of the solar vicinity in three stages : early ( @xmath53 gyr , log ( o / h)@xmath54 dex ) , middle ( 0.5 gyr@xmath55 5.5 gyr , @xmath56 dex @xmath39 log ( o / h)@xmath57 dex ) , and late ( @xmath58 5.5 gyr , log ( o / h)@xmath59 dex ) . in the early stage c",
    "is produced only by massive stars and their contribution to the c / o ratio is low ; in the middle stage the c production is due to lims and massive stars , both kinds of stars have c yields that depend on their initial o / h values ; in the late stage the c / o increase with o / h is determined by metal - rich massive stars .",
    "for comparison , i have included the data presented by nissen ( 2002 , figure 4 ) . in that figure",
    "he presents [ c / o ] and [ o / h ] values : i ) in halo main sequence stars from high excitation lines in near - ir vlt / uves spectra , ii ) in halo stars from high excitation lines by tomkin et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , iii ) in disk stars from forbidden lines with 3d model atmosphere corrections .",
    "i have adopted the same solar abundances that nissen and tomkin et al . assumed , ( allende et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) and grevesse et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , respectively , to obtain the abundance ratios shown in figure 5 .",
    "= 9.0 cm    in figure 6 , i present galactic models for two galactocentric distances , @xmath60 and 10 kpc , for only two sets of yields , c@xmath18 and c@xmath19 yields , and compare the model results with observations of regions in the galaxy , m101 , ngc 604 , and ngc 2363 .",
    "all the measurements shown were derived from abundances determined from pl .",
    "notice that for each model the only c / o value that corresponds to the present time is the highest o / h one , the other o / h values correspond to earlier times . for @xmath61",
    "kpc the present - time c / o and o / h values are lower than the final values shown for @xmath62 kpc .    from figure 6",
    "it follows that the geneva yields ( panel a ) together with c@xmath18 yields provide a good fit to ngc 5471 , a giant region in m101 ( a scdi galaxy ) , to ngc 604 , the brightest region in m33 ( sc , cdii - iii ) and to orion and m8 in the galaxy ( sbci - ii ) ; while for the padova yields ( panel b ) together with c@xmath18 yields the fit for these objects is only fair .",
    "on the other hand , for these objects the geneva and padova yields together with c@xmath19 yields produce a poor fit .    for ngc 5461 , the other region in m101 , the esteban et al .",
    "( 2002 ) value ( c / o@xmath630.4 dex ; o / h@xmath633.1 dex ) is not fitted by pl or fl models .",
    "garnett et al . ( 1999 ) obtain c / o @xmath630.20 dex and o / h@xmath633.49 dex for av=4.1 .",
    "the large differences between these two sets of abundances probably indicate that observations of higher quality are needed for this object .",
    "it is also apparent from figure 6 that ngc 2363 , a region in ngc 2366 and the most metal - poor regions of the sample , can be fitted with geneva or padova yields with the observational c@xmath19 yields .",
    "this result probably implies that the accuracy of the c / o determinations for this object is not yet good enough to be able to distinguish among the different models or the model for the galaxy does not apply to ngc 2366 ( irr ) .",
    "this region might be best fitted with models tailored to irregular galaxies ( eg . carigi et al .",
    "1995 , 1999 , van zee et al .",
    "1998 )    for the models based on geneva yields the c / o gradient steepens with time , because the c yields increase with @xmath32 and the o yields decrease with @xmath32 for massive stars .",
    "but for the models based on the padova yields the gradient flattens in the last stage evolution because the c / o values of the material ejected by supermetallic massive stars and metal - poor stars are similar . from figure 6",
    "it can be seen that at present ( the highest o / h values for each model ) the geneva gradients are steeper than the padova ones .",
    "the milky way is the most evolved galaxy of our sample , therefore its gas content is lower and its regions are more metal - rich .",
    "m101 is less evolved , its gas content is higher and its regions are less metal - rich . to understand better the evolution of m101 , it is necessary to compute models tailored to fit this galaxy",
    "the c evolution of the solar vicinity and the galactic disk evolution are well understood when theoretical yields ( amsterdam or padova ) , which are dependent on @xmath32 and @xmath24 , are assumed .",
    "it is complicated to predict the effect of the observational yields , which are independent of @xmath32 and @xmath24 , on the c evolution , since i ) the initial mass function predicts more low - mass stars than intermediate mass stars and ii ) the low mass stars contribute to the gas enrichment more slowly than the intermediate mass stars .",
    "therefore , we have computed chemical evolution models based on a successful model for the galactic disk with observational yields from c / h abundances in pne to try to discriminate between the yields derived from permitted lines and those derived from forbidden lines .",
    "models that assume observational yields from permitted lines can reproduce the c / o ratios observed in regions and stars of the solar vicinity , but models that consider yields from forbidden lines can not .",
    "the difference of 0.7 dex between the average ( c / h)@xmath64 and ( c / h)@xmath65 ratios is echoed by the predicted c abundance , showing a difference of 0.15 dex between c / h ratios predicted by models that consider c@xmath64 and c@xmath65 yields .    from figure 5",
    ", it can be seen that the halo stars observed with vlt / uves by nissen ( 2002 ) exhibit a nearly constant c / o value of @xmath66 dex , while the mean of the measurements of tomkin et al .",
    "( 1992 ) is log c / o @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , models based on massive star yields by maeder ( 1992 ) predict c / o values lower than those with yields by portinari et al .",
    "therefore , models with maeder yields and theoretical yields for lims reproduce the c / o values observed in halo stars , within 1 @xmath52 for o / h @xmath68 and within 3 @xmath52 at o / h @xmath69 , a fair agreement . but",
    "models with portinari et al .",
    "yields for massive stars and padova yields for lims deviate from the c / o values observed in the halo stars , by 1 @xmath52 for o / h @xmath70 and 4 @xmath52 at o / h @xmath69 , a poor agreement .",
    "carigi ( 2000 ) suggests the yields of massive stars increase with @xmath32 and one of the issues of this work is to find if a similar dependence exists in lims yields .",
    "the c / o values of halo stars test the models at low @xmath32 , while the pne test the models at high @xmath32 . from figure 5",
    "it follows that the yields with constant @xmath32 can adjust objects with o / h values @xmath71 dex , but not the halo stars with o / h values @xmath72 dex . to adjust the halo stars it is necessary to assume that the yields increase with @xmath32 .",
    "the models with theoretical yields provide a reasonable fit to the observations by nissen ( 2002 ) , but do not fit the results by tomkin et al .",
    "( 1992 ) since the @xmath51 models are closer to the halo data than the @xmath50 models it follows that c yields at lower metallicities should be lower than those at higher metallicities , which also supports the result that the yields should increase with @xmath32 .",
    "it is not possible to observationally estimate the c yields for lims from halo pne , because they originate from progenitor stars in the 0.8 to 1.0 range only .",
    "it possible to predict the future evolution of the solar vicinity , and it is very similar to the final evolution for @xmath60 kpc shown in figure 6 . according to the data set by nissen ( 2002 ) , c / o should level off to a plateau at o / h @xmath73 dex , and that plateau is predicted by both sets of models .",
    "in fact , with the padova yields , the models reach a plateau more quickly , but these models predict flat c / o gradients .",
    "moreover , data by nissen ( 2002 ) show a steep rise of c / o around o / h @xmath74 dex , which is better reproduced by models with the padova yields than those with the geneva yields .    to discriminate among models in the early and early - middle evolutionary stage , it is necessary to use as constraints c / h and o / h values of very metal - poor objects .",
    "unfortunately , c abundances in damped ly@xmath75 systems ( dlas ) at high redshifts ( possible protospiral galaxies ) have so far been proved difficult to determine ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) .",
    "recently , lpez et al . (",
    "2002 ) have estimated a lower limit for a possible dust - free dla at @xmath76 , ( [ c / h]@xmath77 , [ o / h]@xmath78 ) , but this c / o value is not accurate enough to constrain the models .",
    "it would be important to determine c and o abundances of spiral galaxies at different distances to test the models . according to the models the c / o",
    "gradient would have a bimodal behaviour with @xmath79 : the gradient gets steeper with @xmath79 at middle and high redshifts , but then , it flattens out at very high @xmath79 .",
    "from chemical evolution models of the galaxy , i conclude that :    \\a ) models with the permitted line yields ( c@xmath18 ) match all the observational constraints , in particular they reproduce the c / o absolute values observed in dwarf stars of the solar vicinity and in regions of the galactic disk .",
