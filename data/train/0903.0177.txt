    "the gauss map @xcite is a chaotic map which generates the integers from a simple continued fraction ( cf ) representation of a real number .",
    "cfs have been used in several different scientific context like , for example , the renormalization group theory @xcite , expansion technique applied to a model for bloch electrons in a magnetic field @xcite , stability of elementary particles @xcite and their mass ratio representation @xcite . in the context of nonlinear dynamics",
    "it has been applied to compute stable and unstable directions of maps @xcite , to approximate irrational winding numbers for the kam tori @xcite and to determine critical parameter values at which the kam tori break @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the stability of perturbed tori in a different situation .",
    "the unperturbed system is the problem of two particles in a 1d - box interacting via hard point - like collisions ( hpc ) .",
    "depending on the mass ratio between particles , the system can be integrable ( invariant surface ( is ) of the flow is a torus with genus @xmath2 ) , pseudo - integrable ( is has a more complicated topology with @xmath3 ) and ergodic ( see @xcite ) . since the hpc case is linearly unstable , the le is zero for each mass ratio and little is known about the stability of the is .",
    "since the hamiltonian is not differentiable at the boundary and at the collisions , no kam curves exist for any perturbation .",
    "classical @xcite ( quantum @xcite ) results strongly suggest that the classical dynamics ( level statistics ) is more unstable ( gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) distribution ) for the pseudo - integrable than the integrable cases . here",
    "the perturbed system is obtained by changing the hpc to a yukawa interaction ( yi ) .",
    "recent classical results @xcite also suggest that pseudo - integrable is from the hpc are more unstable than the integrable ones when the yi is turned on .",
    "we show here that the chaotic dynamics in the perturbed system , the 1d - box with yi , is directly related with the chaotic property of the _ number _ related to the mass ratio @xmath0 between particles .",
    "to do this we compare the le from the infinite continued fraction representation of @xmath1 with the maximal le from the two interacting particles in the 1d box .",
    "in fact , we show that the qualitative behavior of the le in the yi case can be reproduced qualitatively using the le from the lebesgue measure ( lm ) zero periodic orbits from gauss map ( pogm ) .",
    "we also show that the dynamics in the yukawa case is more unstable when pogm are closer to non - pogm . in these cases",
    "` stickiness ' ( tendency of orbits to get trapped ) appears more often in phase space .",
    "this is shown by using the most probable lyapunov exponent , proposed recently @xcite as a very sensitive tool to probe globally details in phase space dynamics .",
    "it is well known from the kam theorem that in two - dimensional systems the torus surface does not exist if @xmath4 lies in a region for rational numbers , where @xmath5 are the frequencies of the unperturbed problem .",
    "the region for rational numbers increases as the perturbation parameter increases .",
    "therefore , only those irrationals that are hardest to approximate by rationals will yield the kam surface .",
    "the residue criterion @xcite establishes a correspondence between the existence of a kam curve and the stability of the periodic orbits that approximate it . in other words , the stability of _ periodic orbits _ very close to _ non - periodic orbits _ ( kam curves ) , allows to make some statements about the destruction of the kam curve . in our case",

    "we calculate explicitally the le for the pogm with lm zero which differ from the ergodic result .",
    "section [ 1dyukawa ] introduces the smooth yukawa interaction between particles and the le distribution is calculated .",

    "the paper ends with conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "two particles in a 1d - box with hpc can be treated as a particular case of the motion of three particles on a finite ring @xcite , which can be mapped onto the motion of a particle in a triangle billiard @xcite .",
    "the whole dynamics can be monitorated by changing the angles of the triangle billiard .",
    "these angles are functions of the masses ratio between particles .",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that the dynamics is non - ergodic if @xmath6 is a rational multiple of @xmath7 , where    @xmath8    writing @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are integers , at most @xmath12 distinct velocity values occur .",
    "these are the periodic orbits from the problem .",
    "although there are infinite mass ratios which give rational values of @xmath13 , some of them are special : the integrable cases @xcite @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) , which have @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) , respectively .",
