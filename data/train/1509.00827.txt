    "numerous authors have asserted that the lmc s field - star and star cluster formation histories are significantly different ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the situation for the smc is less straightforward , although rafelski & zaritsky ( 2005 ) provide tentative evidence that the cluster and field - star age distributions may also be significantly different in this system ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the observed disparities between the cluster and field - star age distributions in the ( dwarf ) starburst galaxies ngc1569 @xcite and m82 @xcite seem to offer evidence in support of a decoupling between star cluster and field - star formation . if confirmed , this would be consistent with the view that massive star cluster formation requires special conditions , e.g. , large scale gas flows , in addition to the presence of dense gas ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "however , this scenario may well only apply to the most massive star clusters , whereas lower - mass clusters could indeed be following the field - star formation history more closely .",
    "this is our main scientific driver here .",
    "this is indeed an issue of general interest in the field of star and star cluster formation , given the commonly held notion that 7090% of stars with masses in excess of 0.5 m@xmath11 may form in clustered environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since most present - day stars in galaxies like the milky way and the magellanic clouds form part of their host galaxies field stellar population , it is not a stretch to suggest that a significant fraction of those field stellar populations originate from disrupted clusters , whether or not the latter were in fact gravitationally bound to begin with .",
    "there is now significant evidence that star cluster systems appear to be affected by a disruption mechanism that acts on very short timescales ( @xmath1230 myr ) and which may be mass - independent , at least for masses @xmath13 m@xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the longer - term dynamical evolution of star clusters is determined by a combination of internal and external timescales .",

    "our final cluster sample includes 313 catalogued clusters .",
    "in general terms , the observed cmds of the selected objects are the result of the superposition of different stellar populations distributed along the line of sight . for this reason ,",
    "using the observed cmds without subtracting the luminosity function and colour distribution of field stars may lead to incorrect interpretations .",
    "moreover , since the catalogued clusters were initially identified as small concentrations of stars on the basis of stellar density fluctuations , their real physical nature requires subsequent confirmation . in order to disentangle cluster stars from field stars , we used cmds of adjacent fields to subtract the local lmc field luminosity function and colour distribution .",

    "for each of the latter regions we constructed cmds showing the defining features of the local lmc star field in that particular direction .",
    "we next applied a procedure which was designed to compare each of the field cmds to the cluster cmd and subtracted from the latter a representative field cmd in terms of stellar density , luminosity function and colour distribution .",

    "the tile covering 30 doradus includes clusters with reddening values in excess of @xmath3 = 0.4 mag .",
    "bearing in mind that the observed cluster sequences are affected by interstellar extinction which is the sum of milky way ( foreground ) and lmc ( internal ) reddening , and that the mean galactic reddening towards the lmc is @xmath57 mag @xcite , it follows that the average ( internal ) reddening in these particular lmc regions is @xmath2 0.10.2 mag .",

    "the most discrepant points in the ogle age comparison are associated with clusters whose cmds include relatively bright blue stars that pu00 either rejected or included in the isochrone matching , thus resulting in , respectively , older ( hs223 , @xmath6 yr@xmath58 ; bsdl725 , @xmath6 yr@xmath59 ) or younger ( hs362 , @xmath6 yr@xmath60 ; hs219 , @xmath6 yr@xmath61 ; h88 - 169 , @xmath6 yr@xmath62 ) ages than our values . as for the comparison with the ages based on washington photometry , which were obtained from isochrone matching to cmds previously corrected for field - star contamination using the same technique described above and for clusters not studied by either pu00 or g10 , better agreement can still be achieved . the correlation with the ages determined by g10 ( 89 clusters ) is less tight , because g10 did not perform field - star decontamination , although these authors mention that field contamination is a severe effect in the extracted cluster cmds and may , therefore , affect the age estimates significantly .",
    "consequently , their age estimates likely reflect the composite lmc stellar populations ( e.g. , kmk88 - 74 ( @xmath6 yr@xmath63 ) , bsdl2807 , ( @xmath6 yr@xmath64 ) , kmk88 - 86 ( @xmath6 yr@xmath65 ) ) .",

    "alternatively , clusters with masses below @xmath70 m@xmath71 for ages younger than 1 gyr do not contribute significantly to the normalized cfs , although they represent on average nearly half of the total number of clusters with age estimates .",

    "moreover , he concluded that possible incompleteness of non - catalogued clusters ( which include the faintest clusters in the galaxy ) does not play an important role in the resulting cfs either . since our cluster age catalogue for the two lmc tiles of interest contains @xmath2 30 per cent more clusters than previously known , we are confident that we can consider our results statistically robust .",
    "indeed , our cluster sample includes @xmath2 80 per cent of the catalogued clusters in the surveyed regions .    in constructing the cfs , we first divided the tiles into 12 subregions of similar size , and then counted the number of clusters in each region , taking into account bin size and age uncertainty effects .",

    "likewise , 30 doradus is spatially surrounded by cluster formation activity characterized by older ages with increasing distance from the object ( blue and red lines ) , possibly approaching the intrinsic cf in the outer lmc bar ( see fig . 5 in p14 ) .",
    "we also compiled composite cfs using all clusters located within each tile and compared them with those previously obtained by p14 for hz09 s bar and the 30 doradus region ( see fig . 6 in hz09 ) .",

    "both pairs of cf curves are very similar .",
    "cf differences become important for @xmath6 yr@xmath74 $ ] .",
    "these differences are likely owing to the fact that p14 s cf covers the entire lmc bar , while the present cf targets its central part only , which is characterized by a relative excess of younger clusters with respect to the entire bar . on the other hand ,",
    "the most noticeable differences between the cfs centred on 30 doradus occur for older ages",
    " @xmath6 yr@xmath75  which is most likely also caused by the larger area covered by hz09 than our tile lmc6_6 , which thus implies that the hz09 cf is composed of a relatively smaller fraction of older clusters .",
    "we superimposed on figs .",
    "8 and 9 the cfs ( red lines ) and the corresponding uncertainties for the bar region in hz09 as well as their 30 doradus region , respectively , assuming that clusters are born according to a power - law mass distribution with a slope @xmath76 and at a rate that is proportional to the sfr determined by hz09 for each region .",
    "the shapes of the cfs recovered from the sfr curves generally follow those of the observed cfs , although the cluster and field - star populations do not seem to have evolved as fully coupled systems .",
    "nevertheless , coupling between field - star and cluster formation appears to have been dominant for both regions .    assuming that most  if not all  stars form in clustered modes @xcite , our results suggest that the combination of cluster formation and disruption rates ( which depend on environmental conditions , cluster masses , among others ) still provides a positive balance , in the sense that the cluster population has not been entirely transformed into field stars .",
    "@xcite showed that about 90@xmath77 of all clusters older than 200 myr are lost per dex of lifetime , which implies a cluster dissolution rate significantly faster than that based on analytic estimates and n - body simulations .",
    "however , @xcite showed that there is no evidence of significant destruction , other than that expected from stellar dynamics and evolution in simple population models for ages up to 1 gyr ( @xmath6 yr@xmath78 ) .",
    "as can be seen , the issue about at what pace cluster disruption takes place in different lmc regions and even whether field stars mostly come from cluster disruption still needs further study .",
    "our results do not allow us to draw any further conclusion about this issue , but that the cluster formation has been different in the studied regions .    by comparing our results with those of hz09 for the two tiles , some hint about the distint roles played by the environments",
    "can be drawn , since differences in cf are larger in the tile lmc6@xmath796 than in lmc6@xmath794 for ages younger than @xmath6 yr@xmath80 .",
    "@xcite tabulated the concentration , central surface brightness , tidal radii , 90@xmath77 enclosed luminosity radii , and local background luminosity density for 1066 star clusters in the magellanic cloud phomotometric survey ( mcps * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they found that while most of the star clusters are similar between the lmc and the smc populations , the lmc lacks star clusters that are large , either in terms of core or 90@xmath77 enclosed luminosity radii as the largest in the smc , and suggested that this result could be featuring a signature of larger tidal stresses in the lmc . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite used n - body simulations of star clusters to investigate the possible dynamical origins of the observed spread in core radius among intermediate - age and old star clusters in the lmc and concluded that the tidal field of the lmc has not yet significantly influenced the evolution of the intermediate - age clusters .",
    "in this sense , we interpret that the actual dynamical state of the studied lmc clusters might be a combination of an age effect ( two - body relataxion ) and their locations in the galaxy ( see .",
    ", e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for the smc ) .     uncertainty ( solid and dashed red lines , respectively).,width=317 ]        finally , we compared the cfs derived here with those obtained from the sfrs derived by @xcite for tile lmc6_6 .",
    "the latter authors derived the sfrs for two subregions ( d1 and d2 ; see their fig .",
    "they used the ` partial model ' technique , which applies a linear combination of partial models that optimally matches the observed hess diagrams allowing the distance modulus , visual extinction , age and metallicty to vary , convolved with the distributions of photometric errors and completeness .",
    "the coefficients of this linear combination of partial models ( including the best - fitting distance modulus and extinction ) are directly converted into the sfrs .",
    "we used their sfrs and cluster masses from @xmath81 ) = 2.2 $ ] to @xmath81 ) = 5.0 $ ] @xcite , and normalized the resulting cfs by the total number of clusters used , so that they can be compared directly with the observed distributions .",
    "figure 10 shows the resulting , recovered cfs , where the uncertainties are indicated by dashed lines .",
    "the observed and recovered cfs are clearly different for ages younger than @xmath6 yr@xmath82 .",
    "even though the recovered cfs require additional refinements , the cluster excesses could be evidence of relatively recent enhanced cluster formation in this part of the galaxy .",
    "likewise , note that both recovered cfs are different between them , which suggests either that cluster disruption changed dramatically from one subregion to the other , or field stars did not come from cluster disruption in a similar proportion . @xcite and @xcite showed that the sfr of field stars varies with the position in the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "conversely , p14 and @xcite found evidence that a similar behaviour occurs within the lmc and smc cluster populations , but not with a completely equivalent pace to field stars .",
    "these results , besides those derived here , provide some clues for a better approach in the study of the field stars origin and its link to cluster disruption and environmental conditions .",
    "dispersions recovered from the corresponding sfrs obtained by @xcite.,width=317 ]",
    "in this paper , we have analysed cmds of previously catalogued star clusters located in the innermost region of the lmc based on a @xmath0 photometric data set obtained by the vmc collaboration .",
    "we focused on tiles lmc 6@xmath794 ( located in the central part of the lmc bar ) and 6_6 ( centred on 30 doradus ) , because they are among the first fully completed tiles of the vmc survey , and they show the most recent star - formation activity in the galaxy .",
    "we obtained psf photometry for stars in and projected along the line of sight towards 313 catalogued clusters , which represents a statistically meaningful sample size .",
    "we applied a field - star subtraction procedure to statistically clean the cluster cmds from field - star contamination and to disentangle cluster features from those associated with their surrounding fields .",
    "the technique we employed makes use of variable cells to reproduce the field cmds as closely as possible .",
    "based on matching theoretical isochrones in the vista system to the cleaned cluster cmds , we obtained estimates of the clusters reddening values and ages , assuming a distance modulus of 18.49 mag and a metallicity of @xmath83 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath84 dex ) .",
    "both surveyed regions are affected by a mean reddening spanning the range @xmath1 $ ] mag ; the average internal ( lmc ) reddening amounts to @xmath2 0.10.2 mag .",
    "in addition , the tile covering 30 doradus includes clusters with reddening values in excess of @xmath3 = 0.4 mag .",
    "the resulting cluster ages span the age range @xmath4 yr@xmath5 .",
    "they form part of the cluster data base which will result from the vmc survey and which will be used to self - consistently study the overall cluster - formation history of the magellanic system .",
    "the age scale derived in this paper is consistent with those resulting from previous publications , in particular those based on ogle @xcite , the magellanic cloud photometric surveys @xcite and the washington photometric system @xcite , among others .",
    "a total of 95 clusters of the 313 objects in our sample had their ages determined for the first time .",
    "this represents an increase of @xmath2 30 per cent of clusters with known ages in the two lmc tile regions .",
    "the enlarged catalogue of clusters with age estimates contains 407 objects .",
    "based on analysis of this statistically complete cluster sample , we addressed the nature of variations in the lmc cf in terms of the clusters spatial distribution .",
    "particular attention was paid to bin sizes and age uncertainties in constructing cfs for 12 different subregions of similar sizes , homogeneously distributed within each lmc tile . as for tile lmc6_4",
    ", we found that the outermost subregions of the lmc bar experienced enhanced cluster formation activity in the past ",
    "@xmath6 yr@xmath7 $ ]  whereas more recently , @xmath6 yr@xmath8 , cluster formation seems to occur more frequently in the inner regions .",
    "overall , however , cluster formation in the central parts of the bar has proceeded in a patchy manner . on the other hand , in tile lmc6_6 , the 30 doradus subregions play the most striking role in the very recent cluster formation history .",
    "they are surrounded by successively older clusters for increasing distances from 30 doradus .    finally , we compared the composite cfs for each lmc tile to those recovered assuming that clusters have formation rates similar to the known field sfrs .",
    "the shapes of the recovered cfs , and more particularly those for the subregions near 30 doradus , suggest that cluster and field - star populations do not seem to have evolved as fully coupled systems during the last @xmath2 100 myr .",
    "the cluster excesses found could be evidence of relatively recent enhanced cluster formation in these parts of the galaxy and thus confirm both that most stars are formed in clusters and that there is no significant destruction other than that expected from stellar dynamics and evolution of simple stellar population models for ages up to 1 gyr .",
