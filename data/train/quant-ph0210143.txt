    "the generation of shape preserving excitations in nonlinear media has been the subject of extensive research in diverse areas of physics , ranging from hydrodynamics @xcite , particle physics @xcite to quantum optics @xcite and optical communications@xcite .",
    "starting from the explanation of the solitary waves in shallow water@xcite , these solutions of the nonlinear wave equations have found ample experimental verifications . in optical context , the nonlinear nature of the coupled maxwell- schrdinger equations @xcite , describing the interaction of classical radiation with matter in a resonant media , has naturally generated tremendous interest in the study of the pulse @xcite and pulse - train solutions@xcite .",
    "recently the continuous pulse - train soliton solutions have been observed experimentally for the two - level system @xcite . for a detailed overview ,",
    "the interested readers are referred to refs.(@xcite ) , apart from the above references .",
    "+ the common factor that governs the existence of the self - similar excitations in various nonlinear systems is the critical balance between nonlinearity and dispersion @xcite .",
    "this severely restricts the set of solutions , in most of the cases , to combinations of the jacobian elliptic functions @xcite and also leads to definite relationships between the amplitudes , widths and velocities of these modes .",
    "the periodic elliptic functions , characterized by the modulus parameter @xmath2 and smoothly interpolating between hyperbolic secant and tangent to periodic cosine and sine functions , for @xmath2 values one and zero respectively , describe localized pulses for @xmath3 and pulse - trains for @xmath4 .    in this light ,",
    "the recent findings of a number of identities involving the superposition of elliptic functions @xcite and their application to various nonlinear systems @xcite makes it extremely interesting to find the implications of the same for the multi - level resonant media . a number of phenomena , like self @xcite and electromagnetically induced transparencies @xcite , pulse sharpening @xcite , pulse cloning and dragging @xcite , just to name a few , are ascribable to the existence of shape - preserving excitations in resonant media .",
    "a great deal of attention , both analytical and numerical , has been paid to the cases in which the resonant atoms are asymptotically in the ground or excited state .",
    "pulse train solutions , characteristic to excited media , have been studied , for two - level @xcite and for three and five - level @xcite configurations .",
    "well - known techniques for generating solutions e.g. , inverse scattering methods @xcite and bcklund transformations @xcite have also been employed for higher level atomic media , albeit under restrictive conditions on the propagation constants and other parameters of these systems .",
    "further progress , in the understanding of the dynamics of the inhomogeneously broadened three level system , has recently been achieved by the derivation of an area theorem @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we first show the existence of novel pulse train solutions , specific to the @xmath0 and @xmath1-type , nonlinear , resonant media , taking recourse to the above mentioned identities , involving elliptic functions .",
    "interestingly , these solutions can either be viewed as a linear superposition of cnoidal waves or as single cnoidal waves , with widely different , modulus dependent amplitudes for different pulse trains .",
    "we find that , for some of these exact solutions , the modulus parameter is controlled by the oscillator strengths of the atomic transitions , as compared to other pulse train solutions found so far , where @xmath2 appears as a free parameter .",
    "interference effects , originating from the superposition nature of these solutions , lead to substantially different field intensities and population densities in different atomic levels .",
    "we then point out the existence of pulse train solutions in the four - level case , similar to the ones found in other multi - level systems .",
    "we start with the three - level @xmath0 system , because of its wide applicability and then proceed to the four - level case , with the energy levels in the configuration of @xmath1 , from which the other lower ones will follow under limiting conditions .",
    "shape preserving solutions , in the form of superposition of a pair of _ different _ cnoidal waves ( like a superposition of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , have been obtained earlier by hioe and grobe @xcite , for the three and five level systems .",
    "these exact solitary waves can have a variety of shapes , because of interference .",
    "the solutions to be discussed here are superpositions of an odd number of cnoidal waves of a _ given _ type ( no combinations involving , say both @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , with appropriately displaced arguments .",
    "as will be seen later in the text , these superposed solutions can have widely different amplitudes .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that , both @xmath6 and @xmath5 functions take values ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , whereas the @xmath9 function has only positive values . hence , the superposed solutions involving @xmath6 and @xmath5 functions can have a much smaller amplitude as compared to the one involving @xmath9 function , whose amplitude can be substantially higher .    for the @xmath0 system consisting of the ground state @xmath10 , excited state @xmath11 and the intermediate state @xmath12 , we assume the fields to have slowly varying pulse envelopes : @xmath13 in the rotating wave approximation , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 act on transitions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the rabi frequencies , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the dipole matrix element of the @xmath20-th transition , are also slowly varying functions of space and time .",
    "we assume , for simplicity that , all the fields are resonant with their respective transitions .    in slowly varying envelope approximations ,",
    "the resonant coupled maxwell - schrdinger equations are @xmath21 in above , we have neglected the relaxation terms , since the pulse widths are taken to be smaller than the relaxation times .",
    "@xmath22 ( @xmath23 represents the probability amplitude of finding the atom in the state @xmath24 .    the parameter @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the density of the atoms and @xmath28 being the oscillator strength for the transition of frequency @xmath29 .",
    "the atomic system is assumed to be continuously distributed in a non - dispersive host medium .",
    "the coordinate @xmath30 measures time relative to the pulse center and @xmath31 .",
    "we look for self - similar solutions of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) i.e. , solutions depending upon a single variable , @xmath32 . here ,",
    "@xmath33 is the pulse duration and , as will be seen later , @xmath34 and @xmath35 will be related via the pulse velocity and another parameter , characterizing the solutions .",
    "the superposed pulse - train solutions , to be discussed here , appear in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 type media and can be made to satisfy a wide range of initial conditions , like no occupancy of the desired atomic levels to partial occupation of all the levels .",
    "it should be pointed out that partial occupation of levels necessarily implies initially induced coherence in the atomic system .",
    "we note that , the pulse train solutions of @xmath0 , @xmath36 and other odd - level systems @xcite , consisting of a matched pair of elliptic functions , do not satisfy the nonlinear equations of the @xmath1 system .",
    "it can be shown that , the following ansatz solutions : @xmath37 satisfy the maxwell - schrdinger equations , provided the functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are as defined below and the constant coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 are appropriately related .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are linear superpositions of the jacobi elliptic functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively : @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 and @xmath39 are analogously defined . here",
    ", @xmath46 is an odd integer , @xmath47 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and @xmath2 is the modulus parameter .",
    "the above solutions are possible for odd integral values of @xmath46 , since the cross terms in the right hand side of eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) are cancelled because of the identities of the type @xcite , @xmath48 here , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and other functions are similarly defined .",
    "although , for definiteness , henceforth we consider only the @xmath52 case , the consistency conditions on the parameters , written below , are identical for all values of @xmath46 .",
    "introducing an additional parameter @xmath53 , for future convenience , one finds , @xmath54~ , \\label{1eq}\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\   b_{e}&= & \\frac { iqa_{e}}{\\mu_{e } } ~ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{2eq }   b_{f}&=&-\\frac{{a}^{\\star}_f}{{a_{e}}^{\\star}}~ ;   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and also the constraint , @xmath55 .",
    "the positive definite character of the pulse intensity , requires that @xmath56  .",
    "the superposed character of the solutions , for higher values of @xmath46 , leads to significant differences between different pulse - train and electron amplitudes , as will be explicated later .",
    "it also manifests in the conservation of probabilities for the electrons . for the @xmath52 case",
    ", @xmath57 leads to , @xmath58}~.\\ ] ] here , @xmath59 and satisfies , @xmath60 the values of @xmath61 range from one to zero continuously , when @xmath2 varies between zero and one .",
    "it can be checked that , when , @xmath3 , the conservation law is identically satisfied , making the above equation vacuous ; in this case one obtains the pulse solutions of the @xmath0 system . for @xmath62 ,",
    "right hand side takes value one , which is ruled out on physical grounds . for other values of @xmath2",
    ", the above equation can be numerically solved to obtain the range of values of @xmath63 for a given @xmath64 .",
    "it should be noted that , since @xmath56 , the variable @xmath65 takes values between zero and one .",
    "it is found that for the superposed solutions to exist , the condition @xmath66 should be satisfied . as depicted in fig.1 ,    epsf    fig .",
    "graph of the modulus parameter @xmath2 versus @xmath67 .",
    "the modulus parameter @xmath2 can lie between one and zero , for the above values of @xmath65 .",
    "hence the choice of @xmath2 @xmath68 determines @xmath63 through eq.([mueq ] ) , which in turn yields @xmath69 , through @xmath70 .",
    "hence the solutions are characterized by the two free parameters @xmath2 and @xmath71 .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath72 has a much higher amplitude as compared to @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; hence the @xmath75 state has a higher population .",
    "the superposition nature of the solutions enables one to have these widely differing amplitudes .",
    "it can be checked that exchange of @xmath73 and @xmath72 also leads to allowed solutions . in that case",
    "the @xmath76 state population can be made large as compared to @xmath77 and @xmath75 states .",
    "for the purpose of comparison , we consider the non - superposed @xmath78 case . taking @xmath79 and replacing @xmath39 and @xmath45 by corresponding cnoidal waves one finds , after appropriately choosing the fields , that , the parameter relationships as obtained in eqs.([1eq],[2eq ] ) are unchanged .",
    "however , the probability conservation now yields substantially different result : @xmath80 it is clear from the above expression that , for , @xmath81 , no pulse train solutions are possible , as @xmath3 , for this case .",
    "since @xmath82 lies between zero and one , it follows from eq.([9eq ] ) that , @xmath83 takes values ranging from @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "it should be pointed that , like the previous case , @xmath84 .",
    "one is then finally left with three free parameters , @xmath35 , @xmath2 and @xmath85 , in their appropriate range of values .",
    "it is possible to obtain another solution by exchanging @xmath43 with @xmath86 , in the above ansatz .",
    "this choice leads to the constraint , @xmath87",
    "in case of the @xmath1 system , one needs to consider seven coupled equations , due to the presence of an additional energy state @xmath88 , in between the states @xmath75 and @xmath76 , of the @xmath0 system .",
    "here , one has the additional parameter , @xmath89 , @xmath90 being the corresponding oscillator strength .",
    "these nonlinear equations have been recently found to possess propagating pulse solutions @xcite .",
    "introducing , the additional electron amplitude @xmath91 and the rabi frequency @xmath92 in the ansatz solutions , we only write below , the new and modified parametric relations , as compared to the @xmath0 system : @xmath93~,\\nonumber\\\\   |a_{e}|^2&=&4{\\gamma}^2m\\frac{{\\mu_{e}}^2}{\\mu_{f}{\\mu_{v}}}~,\\\\ \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b_{v}&= & \\frac { iqa_{v}}{\\mu_{v } } ~ , \\nonumber\\\\   b_{f}&=&-\\frac{a^{\\star}_f}{{a}^{\\star}_e}\\frac{\\mu_{e}}{\\mu_{f}}~.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that here , @xmath94 determines @xmath95 , unlike the @xmath0 system .",
    "the positive definite character of the pulse intensities now requires the inequalities , @xmath96    in the present case , the conservation of probability yields , @xmath97}~.\\ ] ] this leads to the constraint on the oscillator strengths : @xmath98 , for @xmath84 .",
    "it is worth noting that , as compared to @xmath0-system , in the present case the oscillator strengths determine modulus parameter @xmath2 .    the uniform group velocity , as determined by our solutions is given by , @xmath99 as the width of the pulse train becomes shorter ( @xmath35 gets larger ) , the group velocity approaches the background medium velocity ; however , for smaller values of @xmath2 , the pulse train velocity can be significantly smaller than the medium velocity .",
    "we have checked that a different superposition type solution , e.g. , @xmath100 and exchange of @xmath45 and @xmath39 for other fields , do not alter the above conclusions .",
    "however , the population of different levels , as well as the field amplitudes can be substantially different , from the earlier case .",
    "it is straightforward to see , from eqs.([neq1 ] ) and ( [ neq2 ] ) , that unlike the @xmath0-system , the @xmath1-system is characterized by one free parameter @xmath35 .",
    "it is worth noting that , for the two level case , corresponding to @xmath101 , as well as for the @xmath36 system , for which @xmath102 , the constraint equation originating from the probability conservation yields , @xmath103 since @xmath104 and @xmath105 , it is easy to see that , the above equation can not be satisfied .",
    "hence these type of excitations are exclusive to @xmath0 and @xmath1 type systems .",
    "a better understanding of the above solutions can be provided by a dual interpretation of these excitations , through a set of generalized landen transformations , found recently . for the @xmath52 case , the transformation formula yields , @xmath106~,\\ ] ] where @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 with @xmath59@xmath109 . for the @xmath110 and @xmath111 functions , the formulae have same widths in right hand side as in @xmath112 ; however , the amplitude @xmath20 is replaced by @xmath113 , given by @xmath114~.\\ ] ] the facts that , @xmath9 takes only positive values and @xmath6 have values ranging from @xmath115 to @xmath7 , can be seen to be the reason behind the large value of @xmath20 as compared to that of @xmath113 .",
    "hence , the superposed cnoidal waves can have widely varying amplitudes , which leads to significant differences in atomic level occupations .",
    "since the four - level system has not been systematically analyzed for pulse train solutions , we would like to point out that , like the two - level case , pure cnoidal waves , with comparable electron and field amplitudes , can also be obtained as solutions to the @xmath1 system .",
    "as has been mentioned earlier , matched pair type pulse train solutions of the odd - level atomic systems @xcite are not solutions of the four - level system .",
    "it can be seen that , the following ansatz solutions : @xmath116 and @xmath117 satisfy the maxwell - schrdinger equations , provided @xmath118 and the constant coefficients @xmath119 and @xmath120 are related .",
    "the consistency conditions on all the parameters are now modified : @xmath121~,\\nonumber\\\\   |a_{f}|^2&=&4{\\gamma}^2m[\\frac{\\mu_{e}}{\\mu_{v}}-1]~,\\nonumber\\\\   |a_{e}|^2&=&4{\\gamma}^2\\frac{{\\mu_{e}}^2}{\\mu_{f}{\\mu_{v}}}~,\\nonumber\\\\   b_{e}&= & \\frac { i\\mu_{v}a_{e}b_{i}}{2\\mu_{e}\\gamma } ~ ,",

    "the velocity is now modified and depends upon @xmath122 : @xmath123 for the purpose of considering limiting cases of the @xmath1 system , we observe that , when the modulus parameter @xmath2 equals one , the cnoidal functions go over to hyperbolic ones , thereby yielding localized pulse solutions .",
    "the pulse trains are obtained , when @xmath84 , the @xmath62 value being ruled out in the present case .",
    "since @xmath124 is positive , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ 4eq ] ) that , for the @xmath1 system , @xmath125 must be less than one , for the latter type of solutions . however , for the two level case , where @xmath126 , the above restriction does not apply . in that case ,",
    "@xmath127 and one obtains the cnoidal solutions , similar to a set of solutions , obtained by crisp and arecchi et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in an inhomogeneous media . exchanging @xmath43 with @xmath86 in the above ansatz , leads to @xmath128 ; in this case one obtains the solutions , analogous to another set of solutions given in ref .",
    "@xcite , under inhomogeneous conditions .",
    "this is also clear from the analysis of the @xmath0 system , which is obtained from the @xmath1 system under the condition , @xmath55 , with @xmath129 .",
    "the above point also indicates that for the @xmath0 system , obtained as a limiting case , @xmath130 , in order for the pulse train solution to exist .",
    "one obtains localized pulse solutions for @xmath131 , since in that case @xmath3 . for the @xmath36 system ,",
    "for which @xmath132 , the conclusions are similar to the two - level case . a comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the above solutions form a subclass of the matched pair solutions , for the @xmath0 and @xmath36 system .",

    "fig.4 reveals the same for different parameter values .",
    "one sees that , for @xmath142 the amplitude of superposed @xmath134 solution attains a very small value .",
    "it is extremely interesting to observe that , the excited state probability density can be made very small and other densities enhanced , through these novel solutions , which is not possible through pure cnoidal waves .",
