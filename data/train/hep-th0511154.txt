    "several thought experiments in semi - classical quantum gravity and string theory @xcite-@xcite imply uncertainties in space - time observables such as distances .",
    "this suggests that the smooth continuum space - time , which is the classical notion of space - time in general relativity , should be replaced with a quantum one in yet unknown theory of quantum gravity . an interesting candidate is given by non - commutative geometry or fuzzy space @xcite .",
    "the main general idea of fuzzy space is that a space - time is not apriori given by coordinates , but is defined by the algebraic relations of the fields on it .",
    "since matter and space - time can not be separately considered in physics , the main idea itself would be acceptable for many of the physicists , although it is harder to apply the idea to physics than the standard methods .",
    "the dynamics of space - time can be classically described by the general relativity . on the other hand , it is not yet clear what can describe the dynamics of a fuzzy space - time . the description should approach the general relativity in classical limit .",
    "the central principle of general relativity is the invariance under the general coordinate transformation",
    ". it would be obviously interesting if a dynamical fuzzy space can be obtained from formulation invariant under a fuzzy analog of the general coordinate transformation .",
    "this kind of formulation would lead to fuzzy general relativity , which may describe dynamical fuzzy spaces .    a fuzzy space is characterized by the algebraic relations @xmath4 of the functions @xmath2 on it .",
    "therefore it would be a natural assumption that a dynamical fuzzy space can be obtained by making the three - index variable @xmath0 a dynamical variable .",
    "it will be argued in the following section that a fuzzy analog of the general coordinate transformation is given by the general linear transformation on @xmath2 .",
    "thus the central proposal of this talk , which is mainly based on the paper @xcite , is that fuzzy space dynamics should be described by a theory of dynamical @xmath0 with the invariance under the general linear transformation .",
    "the above proposal is that dynamical fuzzy spaces are described by a kind of tensor models .",
    "actually tensor models appeared previously in the study of quantum gravity as a description of the simplicial quantum gravity in more than two dimensions @xcite .",
    "however there are differences in the treatment of the tensor models between the simplicial quantum gravity and the dynamical fuzzy spaces . in the context of the simplicial quantum gravity ,",
    "the integration with the tensor variables generates the partition function , and the classical solutions are not important . on the contrary ,",
    "semi - classical treatment plays central roles in this talk .",
    "in other words , it is assumed that the tensor models can be treated semi - classically in certain limits .",
    "another difference from the simplicial gravity is that tensors of rank higher than three are not considered irrespective of the dimensions of space .",
    "i expect that fuzzy spaces of various dimensions can be generated from three - tensor models",
    ". this will be an appropriate feature of the models , because the dimensions should be a dynamical effective quantity of a fuzzy space .    in the following section , a fuzzy analog of the general coordinate transformation",
    "is discussed and the general form of the models is proposed . in section [ thesolutions ] , it is shown that the solutions to the equations of motion can be generally constructed from the invariant tensors of lie groups . in section [ euclideanmodel ] ,",
    "euclidean models are introduced , the actions of which are bounded from below . in section",
    "[ solution ] , the lie group symmetric classical solutions to a class of euclidean models are obtained . in section [ fluctuation ] , the fluctuations around the so(3 ) symmetric solution are analyzed in the quadratic order , and the space associated with the solution is identified with fuzzy @xmath3 .",
    "the final section is devoted to discussions and comments .",
    "let me first review the general coordinate transformation in the usual continuous space @xmath5 .",
    "a basis of the continuous functions on @xmath5 can be given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the coordinates of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath2 with an index @xmath8 denote these independent functions in the set .",
    "a continuous function on @xmath5 is given by a linear combination of @xmath2 .",
    "let me consider a general coordinate transformation , @xmath9 it is a natural restriction that the coordinate transformation is not singular , and is invertible .",
    "since the right - hand side is a continuous function , the general coordinate transformation can be rewritten as a linear transformation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 are real .",
    "now let me consider a fuzzy space with a finite number of independent functions @xmath12 on it .",
    "this fuzzy space is a fuzzy analogue of a compact space in usual continuous description .",
    "it is assumed that all the @xmath2 are real functions , and therefore the variable @xmath0 , which determines the algebraic relations @xmath1 , is assumed to be real .",
    "neither the associativity nor the commutativity of the algebra is assumed , so that @xmath0 has no other constraints .",
    "an important assumption of this talk is to interpret the transformation rule as a partial appearance of a more general linear transformation , @xmath13 where @xmath14 can take any real values provided that the matrix @xmath14 is invertible , which comes from the assumed invertibility of the coordinate transformation .",
    "thus the fuzzy general coordinate transformation is the gl(@xmath15,@xmath16 ) transformation on @xmath2 . under the transformation ,",
    "the three - index variable @xmath0 transforms in @xmath17    in the next , let me discuss the construction of an action invariant under the gl(@xmath15,@xmath16 ) transformation . from the transformation property , the lower and upper indices",
    "must be contracted to make an invariant .",
    "since @xmath0 has more lower indices than the upper , it is necessary to introduce an additional variable which has more upper indices to construct an invariant action as a polynomial function of @xmath0",
    ". therefore i introduce a new variable with two upper indices , @xmath18 , which is real and symmetric in the indices , @xmath19 .",
    "thus an invariant action is a function of the two dynamical real variables @xmath18 and @xmath0 , @xmath20 where all the indices are contracted .",
    "in this section i discuss the general properties of the classical solution to the equation of motion from the invariant action .",
    "let me suppose that the equation of motion of @xmath0 , [ eomgeneralofc ] = 0 , is satisfied for @xmath21 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , using the invariance under the gl(@xmath15,@xmath16 ) transformation , the equation of motion of @xmath18 is automatically satisfied if @xmath22 is not degenerate and is satisfied .",
    "now let me consider a lie group which has a representation of dimension @xmath15 .",
    "the representation can be either reducible or irreducible , and can be either real or even complex , provided that the invariant tensors considered below are real .",
    "let me embed the representation to a classical solution : the lower index of a classical solution is assumed to be transformed in the representation , while the upper one in the inverse representation .",
    "let @xmath22 be a real symmetric rank - two invariant tensor under the inverse representation .",
    "i assume the tensor @xmath22 is invertible as a matrix .",
    "let me introduce @xmath23 , which span all the real tensors invariant under the same transformation property as @xmath24 .",
    "let me consider an ansatz that @xmath24 is given by a linear combination of these invariant tensors , [ caexpression ] c^0_ab^c= a_^c , where @xmath25 are real coefficients .",
    "since the action is obviously invariant under the transformation of the lie group , the left - hand side of becomes a real invariant tensor when @xmath18 and @xmath0 are substituted with the invariant tensors above .",
    "therefore , after exchanging the upper and lower indices by using @xmath22 and its inverse @xmath26 , the left - hand side of can be expanded with @xmath27 , g^0_ai g^0_bj g_0^ck . | _",
    "g = g_0 + c = c^0    = b_(a_1,a_2,,a_n)i^_ab^c , where @xmath28 are functions of @xmath29 , which are determined from the form of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the equation of motion is reduced to the following simultaneous equations for @xmath29 , [ simbeq ] b_(a_1,a_2,,a_n)=0 ,   ( = 1,,n ) .",
    "these equations are generally much easier to solve than .",
    "since the numbers of the variables and the equations are the same , the simultaneous equations will generally have some number of solutions .",
    "the solutions are generally complex , but real solutions can be actually found in some interesting cases .",
    "some series of so(3 ) invariant solutions to some examples of equations of motion are given in @xcite .",
    "in the following i consider the constrained models which are expected to produce fuzzy spaces with euclidean signatures .",
    "it is imposed that [ gdelta ] g^ab=_ab , and @xmath18 is not dynamical . even though the underlying symmetry has been changed from gl(@xmath31 ) to so(@xmath15 ) , this euclidean model seems to be interesting enough .",
    "one reason is that , as mentioned in the previous section , the detailed value of @xmath18 is not important in constructing the classical solutions .",
    "another reason is that , while the number of the degrees of freedom of @xmath0 is @xmath32 , that of @xmath18 is only @xmath33 , and may be negligible in the continuum limit @xmath34 , regardless of whether @xmath18 is dynamical or not .",
    "an advantage of the constraint is that one can construct an action bounded from below .",
    "the existence of a bound will make it easier to find a stable classical solution .    to construct a bounded action ,",
    "let me start with an elementary fact that a real matrix @xmath35 identically satisfies the following inequality , ( m^tm ) 0 , where tr and @xmath36 denotes the trace and the transpose of matrix , respectively .",
    "consider real matrices @xmath37 , and apply this inequality to @xmath38 .",
    "then one obtains [ mtm ]",
    "tr(m_a m_a ) + tr(m_a^t m_a ) 0 , where the repeated index @xmath8 is summed over , and the same abbreviation will be implicitly assumed below . in the same way",
