    "scarce doubts remain that dark energy ( de ) exists . not only snia data indicate an accelerated cosmic expansion ( perlmutter et al . 1997 , 1998 , riess et al .",
    "1998 , foley et al . 2007 ) ; also cmb and deep sample data show a clear discrepancy between the total density parameter @xmath5 approaching unity , and the matter density parameter @xmath6@xmath7 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , spergel et al .",
    "de covers this gap ; its state parameter @xmath8 must approach @xmath9 today , so apparently excluding that de is made of free particles ( @xmath10 : de pressure , energy density ) .",
    "the true nature of de is however still elusive ; a false vacuum and a self  interacting scalar field are among the most popular hypotheses for it ( wetterich 1988 , ratra & peebles 1988 ) .",
    "in this paper we explore some possible consequences of our poor knowledge of de nature .",
    "in particular we test the risk that other cosmological parameter estimates are biased by a inadequate parametrization of the de component .",
    "we shall see that this risk is real .",
    "theoretical predictions had an astonishing success in fitting cmb data .",
    "for instance , the sw effect , predicting low@xmath11 @xmath12 data , or primeval compression waves , predicting @xmath12 peaks and deeps , were clearly detected .",
    "there is little doubt that we are exploring the right range of models .",
    "when we investigate de nature through cmb data , we must bear in mind that they were mostly fixed at a redshift @xmath13 when the very de density should be negligible , and so affects peak and deep positions indirectly , through the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( here @xmath16km / s / mpc is the present hubble parameter ; @xmath17 are the present total , cdm , baryon density parameters ) .",
    "later information on de state equation , conveyed by the isw effect , is seriously affected by cosmic variance and often relies on the assumption that a single opacity parameter @xmath18 can account for reionization , assumed to be ( almost ) instantaneous . accordingly ,",
    "if we assume dynamical de ( dde ) , due to a scalar field @xmath19 self interacting through a potential @xmath20 cmb data allow to exclude some interaction shape , _",
    "e.g. _ ratra  peebles ( 1988 ) potentials with significantly large @xmath21 energy scales , but hardly convey much information on potential parameters .    in spite of that , when we choose a de potential or a specific scale dependence of the de state parameter @xmath22 we risk to bias the values of other cosmological parameters , sometimes leading to premature physical conclusions .",
    "an example is the value of the primeval spectral index for scalar fluctuation @xmath23 . using wmap3 data ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) and assuming a @xmath21cdm cosmology , the value @xmath24 is `` excluded '' at the 2@xmath25 confidence level . on the contrary , colombo & gervasi ( 2007 ) showed that this is no longer true in a dde model based on a sugra potential ( brax & martin 1999 , 2001 ; brax , martin & riazuelo 2000 ) , whose likelihood was the same of @xmath21cdm .",
    "the risk that our poor knowledge of de nature biases parameter determination is even more serious if dm  de coupling is allowed . coupled de ( cde ) cosmologies were studied by various authors ( see , _ e.g. _ , wetterich 1995 , amendola 2000 , bento , bertolami & sen 2002 , macci et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "while dde was introduced in the attempt to ease de _ fine  tuning _ problems , cde tries to ease the _ coincidence _ problem .",
    "let us then parametrise the strength of dm  de coupling through a parameter @xmath26 defined below .",
    "when @xmath27 is large enough , dm and de scale ( quasi ) in parallel since a fairly high redshift . in turn",
    "this modifies the rate of cosmic expansion whenever dm and/or de contributions to the total energy density are non ",
    "negligible , so that limits on @xmath27 can be set through data .",
    "the range allowed ( @xmath280.12 ; mainini , colombo & bonometto 2005 , mainini & bonometto 2007 , see also majerotto , sapone & amendola 2004 , amendola , campos & rosenfeld , 2006 ) , unfortunately , is so limited that dm and de are doomed to scale differently , but in a short redshift interval .",
    "clearly , this spoils the initial motivation of coupling , but , once the genie is outside the lamp , it is hard to put him back inside : even though the coupling solves little conceptual problems , we should verify that no bias arises on the other parameters , for the neglect of @xmath27 s consistent with data .",
    "this is far from being just a theoretical loophole , the still unknown physics of the dark components could really imply the presence of a mild dm  de coupling , and its discovery could mark a step forwards in the understanding of their nature .    here",
    "we test this possibility by performing some numerical experiments .",
    "we assume dde and cde due to a sugra potential and use mcmc techniques to fit the following parameter set : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath23 , @xmath32 and ( constant ) @xmath0 ; @xmath31 is the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination ( see however below ) , @xmath23 and @xmath32 are spectral index and amplitude of scalar waves , no tensor mode is considered .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we discuss how artificial data are built , outlining the models selected , the dde potential used and the sensitivity assumed . in section 3",
    "we briefly debate the features of the mcmc algorithm used and illustrate a test on its efficiency , also outlining the physical reasons why some variables are more or less efficiently recovered . in section 4 we discuss the results of an analysis of dde artificial data , against the @xmath33 assumption . in section 5",
    "we briefly summarize why and how cde models are built and do the same of sec .  4 for cde models .",
    "this section yields the most significant results of this work . in section 6",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "in order to produce artificial data we use camb , or a suitable extension of it ( see below ) , to derive the angular spectra @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 for various sets of parameter values .",
    "artificial data are then worked out from spectra , according to perotto et al .",
    "( 2006)@xmath37 .",
    "the analysis we report is however mostly based on a single choice of parameters , wmap5 inspired ( see komatsu et al . , 2008 , spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , in association with three different @xmath27 s .",
    "two other parameter choices will also be used : ( i ) to test the efficiency of the mcmc algorithm ; ( ii ) to add results for a still lower @xmath27 value , so strengthening our conclusions .",
    "the parameter sets for the most general case and the ( ii ) case are shown in table  1 . in these cases",
    "de is due to a scalar field self  interacting through a sugra potential @xmath38 ( @xmath39 planck mass ) which has been shown to fit cmb data at least as well as @xmath21cdm ( colombo & gervasi 2007 ) ; as outlined in the table , we input the value of the energy scale @xmath40 the corresponding @xmath41 value is determined by the program itself ; the choice @xmath42gev is consistent with colombo & gervasi ( 2007 ) findings and is however scarcely constrained by data .",

    "see , e.g. percival & brown ( 2006 ) .",
    "( ii ) the algorithm then randomly selects a different point @xmath90 , in parameter space , according to a suitable _ selection function_. the probability of accepting @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath90 is accepted , it is added to the chain , otherwise the multiplicity @xmath92 of @xmath84 increases by 1 .",
    "( iii ) the whole procedure is then iterated starting either from @xmath90 or from @xmath84 again , until a stopping condition is met .",
    "the resulting chain is defined by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 are the points explored and the multiplicity @xmath95 is the number of times @xmath94 was kept .",
    "the whole cycle is repeated until the chains reach a satisfactory _ mixing _ and a good",
    "_ convergence_. the first requisite essentially amounts to efficiently exploring the parameter space , by quickly moving through its whole volume .",
    "in particular , the fact that the algorithm sometimes accepts points with lower likelihood than the current point , avoids permanence in local minima , while a careful choice of parametrization and of the selection function minimize the time spent exploring degenerate directions .",
    "a good convergence instead guarantees that the statistical properties of the chains ( or of a suitably defined subset of the chains ) , correspond to those of the underlying distribution .",
    "here we implement the convergence criterion of gelman & rubin ( 1992 ) , based on @xmath70ratio computation : convergence and mixing are reached when @xmath96 . fulfilling such criterion requires @xmath97 points , in the cases considered here .",

    "this is a well  known consequence of the geometrical degeneracy present in cmb spectra , and clearly shows the difficulty of cmb data to yield results on de nature .",
    "the non  gaussian behavior is even more accentuated for some derived parameter , as @xmath98 , @xmath2 and the universe age @xmath99 we shall recover analogous features in the next plots ; here we want to stress that they do not derive from fitting a partially unsuitable parameter set .",
    "figure [ lcdm ] also shows how errors increase when passing to some secondary parameter , from primary parameters specifically devised to break degeneracies .",

    "a first insight into the actual situations can be however gained through an inspection of hubble diagrams and transfer functions .    in figure [ hubdia ]",
    "we show the redshift dependence of the luminosity distances for models with @xmath123 , 0.05 , 0.1 and compare them with the corresponding best  fit models with constant @xmath0 , as well as with scdm models with the same value of @xmath311 .",
    "these plots clearly indicate that a fit with snia data would hardly allow any discriminatory signal : discrepancies from constant@xmath0 model increase with @xmath27 ; but , even for the @xmath312 case , they hardly exceed @xmath313 of the difference from scdm .    in figure [ trans ]",
    "we then exhibit the transfer functions @xmath314 ( multiplied by @xmath315 to improve the visibility of details ) for models a.    in the cases @xmath316 and @xmath255 , we notice slight displacements for the bao system and the slope .",
    "the actual setting of bao s is however subject to non  linear effects and residual theoretical uncertainties are wider than the shifts in the plots .",
    "the change of slope is also easily compensated by a shift of @xmath23 by @xmath317 , widely within expected observational errors .",
    "notice then that the relative position of the input and best  fit functions is opposite in the two cases .",
    "accordingly , in the intermediate case @xmath318 , not shown in the plot , the overlap is almost exact and the observed scale dependence of the growth factor , at low redshift , does not break the degeneracy at all .",
    "the situation is different when @xmath319 is considered . for @xmath258 ,",
    "the bao displacement is indeed relevant ; to compensate for the change of slope , we would then require a shift of @xmath23 greater than 0.1@xmath37 .",
    "a numerical analysis can therefore determine at which value , probably intermediate between 0.05 and 0.1 , the cmb spectra degeneracy is broken .",
    "the nature of the dark cosmic components is unclear .",
    "de could be a self  interacting field , yielding a scale dependent state parameter @xmath320 which bias does then arise on cosmological parameter estimates , if performed by assuming @xmath321 ? this question regards also parameters which do not describe de ; their estimate could be biased because the _ true _ model is not directly explored .",
    "a first conclusion of this work is that such bias exists but , in the cases we treated , yields acceptable displacements , within 1@xmath25 .",
    "suppose however that future data allow to exclude @xmath322 , within 3@xmath25 s , when we assume @xmath321 .",
    "setting @xmath323 discriminates among inflationary potentials .",
    "it would be however legitimate to assess that , at that stage , such conclusions would still be premature .",
    "our analysis was then extended to the case of dm  de coupling .",
    "the idea that dm and de have related origins or arise from the same field has been widely pursued ( see , _ e.g. _ kamenshchik , moschella & pasquier 2001 , bento , bertolami sen 2002 , 2004 ; mainini & bonometto 2004 ; for a review , see  copeland , sami & tsujikawa 2006 ) .",
    "coupling causes dm  de energy exchanges and this option was first explored in the attempt to ease the _ coincidence _ problem .",
    "unfortunately , when a dm  de coupling , strong enough to this aim , is added to models , predictions disagree with data .",
    "this does not forbid , however , that the physics of the dark components includes a weaker coupling or that a stronger coupling is compensated by other features ( see , _ e.g. _ , la vacca et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in this work we pointed out that a significant degeneracy exists , so that we can find an excellent fit of cmb data for coupled de cosmologies just by using constant@xmath0 uncoupled cosmologies .",
    "the fit is so good that even likelihood estimates do not allow to distinguish between the `` true '' cosmology and the best ",
    "fit constant@xmath0 model , at the present or foreseeable sensitivity levels .",
    "_ unfortunately , however , the values obtained for several parameters are then widely different from input ones . _    in fact",
    ", if we ignore the coupling degree of freedom , when data are analyzed , we can find biased values for some primary parameter as @xmath1 , for which input values lay @xmath324@xmath25 s away from what is `` detected '' .",
    "also @xmath325 and @xmath2 , which are secondary parameters , are significantly biased . in particular , with a coupling as low as @xmath255 , we found model realisations yielding @xmath2 estimate @xmath326@xmath25 s away from the input value . if we keep to the fiducial case , however , the probability to find @xmath327 its input value is 36.5@xmath328 for @xmath255 and 26.5@xmath328 for @xmath329 this outlines the tendency to find smaller values than `` true '' ones .    as a matter of fact , however , because of the uncertainty induced by our ignorance on de state equation , the width of errors on secondary parameter significantly exceeds the width for primary ones , and a 5@xmath25 discrepancy is partially hidden by such ignorance .",
    "this agrees with the fact that data analysis shows a significant increase of errors on secondary parameters when the set of models inspected passes from @xmath21cdm to generic@xmath0 cosmologies .",
    "for instance , in the very wmap5 analysis , the error on @xmath330 increases by a huge factor @xmath331 , when one abandons the safety of @xmath21cdm to explore generic constant@xmath0 models .",
    "a general warning is then that errors obtained assuming @xmath21cdm are to be taken with some reserve .",
    "an important question is whether the bias persists when different observables , besides cmb , are used .",
    "a preliminary inspection shows that snia data would hardly provide any discrimination . on the contrary",
    "an analysis of fluctuation growth can be discriminatory if @xmath3320.08  .",
    "an even more discriminatory signal could be found in the @xmath333 dependence of the growth factor is suitably analyzed .",
    "observational projects aiming at performing a tomography of weak lensing , like dune  euclid ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refregier et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) , therefore , can be expected to reduce this degeneracy  case ."
