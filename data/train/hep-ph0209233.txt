    "the charmless two - body b decays play a crucial role in determining the flavor parameters , especially the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) angles @xmath2 and @xmath12 . with the successful running of b factories ,",
    "many charmless decay channels have been measured with great precision . however , since hadronic b decays involve three separate scales , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where perturbative and nonperturbative effects are entangled , it is highly nontrivial to relate flavor parameters to experimental observables .",
    "recently , theorists have made much progress in nonleptonic b decays : three novel methods , qcd factorization ( qcdf)@xcite , the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd)@xcite and the charming penguin method@xcite , have been proposed .",
    "these methods have very different understandings of b decays : for both the qcdf and pqcd approaches , the factorization theorem is proved for nonleptonic b decays in the leading power expansion , i.e. , short - distance physics related to the scales @xmath16 and @xmath14 can be separated from long - distance physics related to the hadronization scale @xmath15 , and the long distance part can be parameterized into some universal nonperturbative parameters . in this sense , they are similar .",
    "but the pqcd approach implements the sudakov form factor to suppress the end - point contributions and proves the factorization theorem in which the form factors are perturbatively calculable .",
    "notice that sudakov form factor itself is a perturbative quantity ; it is rather radical and controversial to prove the factorization using the sudakov form factor , while in qcdf the form factors are believed to be nonperturbative parameters",
    ". therefore these two methods have completely different power behaviors for b decays .",
    "their predictions of b decays are also quite different . for instance",
    ", pqcd generally predicts large strong phases and direct cp violations , while qcdf favors small direct cp violations in general because of the @xmath17-suppressed strong phases .",
    "the charming penguin process , i.e. , @xmath18 , might be potentially important for penguin - dominant decays because it is doubly enhanced by ckm factors and wilson coefficients .",
    "the characteristic of the charming penguin method is that the soft - dominance charming penguin plays an indispensable role for penguin - dominant decays . while in qcdf charm penguin contributions are hard dominance and therefore perturbatively calculable according to naive power counting rules .",
    "now babar and belle have accumulated copious data , and will record much more data , on nonleptonic b decays",
    ". thus it should be highly interesting to compare the predictions of these methods with precise experimental measurements .",
    "we gave the qcdf predictions on b @xmath19 pp and pv decays in recent works @xcite . with the experimental data at that time ,",
    "our results prefer a somewhat larger angle @xmath2 . for pv decays ,",
    "the qcdf predictions are only marginally consistent with the experimental observation for some decay channels .",
    "notice that the qcdf predictions contain large numerical uncertainties due to the ckm matrix elements , form factors , and annihilation parameters , and furthermore , the uncertainties of various decay channels are strongly correlated to each other ; we are stimulated to do a global analysis in this paper to check the consistency between the predictions of qcdf and the updated experimental results .",
    "_ @xcite have done a global analysis including @xmath20 , @xmath21 modes with the qcdf approach and have shown a satisfactory agreement between the qcdf predictions and experiments , while in this work we shall consider not only @xmath0 decays , but also @xmath22 channels .",
    "thereby , as we will see later , it leads to some new interesting results .",
    "one of the most impressive predictions of the qcdf approach is that direct cp violation of charmless b decays should be small because the strong interaction phase arises solely from radiative corrections . up to now",
    "it has been very consistent with the measurements of babar and belle .",
    "however , power corrections which may also contribute to strong phases are numerically comparable with radiative corrections . notice that the power corrections are difficult to estimate because they generally break factorization .",
    "it means that the predictions of qcdf on direct cp violations are probably qualitative . therefore in this paper",
    "we will not consider experimental results on direct cp violations .",
    "our global fit shows that qcdf has an excellent performance on @xmath23 ( two light pseudoscalars ) decays except for the channel @xmath24 .",
    "but we do not worry about it because of the hard - to - estimate contributions from the digluon mechanism and the potential large power corrections in this channel .",
    "the ckm angle @xmath2 is preferred to be around @xmath3 which is slightly larger but still consistent with the standard ckm global analysis@xcite .",
    "we also discuss the preferred range of the penguin - to - tree ratio @xmath4 for @xmath25 decay is @xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 } { ( a_{1}+a_{4}^{u}+r^{\\pi}_{\\chi}a_{6}^{u } )            + ( a_{10}^{u}+r^{\\pi}_{\\chi}a_{8}^{u } )      + r_{a}[b_{1}+b_{3}+2b_{4}-\\frac{1}{2}(b_{3}^{ew}-b_{4}^{ew})]},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . ] which is crucial for the extraction of angle @xmath12 . for @xmath22 ( one pseudoscalar , one vector ) decays ,",
    "qcdf has also a good performance where the annihilation topology plays an important role especially for penguin - dominated decays .",
    "but for @xmath11 channels , the qcdf results seem smaller compared with the experimental measurements",
    ". however , presently there are large experimental errors on these channels , so it would be very interesting for babar and belle to update their measurements with higher precision on these decay modes .",
    "based on the global fit , we also give the confidence levels for some interesting decay channels : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath30 , @xmath10 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we will first recapitulate the mainpoint of qcd factorization for charmless two - body b decays . in sec .",
    "iii , the relevant input parameters are discussed .",
    "then the numerical results of the global fit and brief remarks are presented in sec .",
    "section v is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "as we know , charmless b decays contain three distinct scales : @xmath31 .",
    "to go beyond the naive model estimation , it is important to show that the physics of different scales can be separated from each other .",
    "this process is generally called `` factorization '' .",
    "it is well known that , with the help of the operator product expansion and renormalization group equation , the effective lagrangian can be obtained , in which short - distance effects involving large virtual momenta of the loop corrections from the scale @xmath16 down to @xmath32 are cleanly integrated into the wilson coefficients",
    ". then the amplitude for the decay @xmath33 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a ckm factor , @xmath36 is the wilson coefficient which is perturbatively calculable from first principles , and @xmath37 is a hadronic matrix element which contains physics from the scale @xmath32 down to @xmath15 . in a sense",
    ", this process may be called `` first step factorization '' .",
    "but it is still highly nontrivial to estimate the hadronic matrix elements reliably because the perturbative and nonperturbative effects related to @xmath14 and @xmath15 are strongly entangled .",
    "three years ago , beneke _ et al . _ put forward the qcdf approach in the heavy quark limit for @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "they show that , neglecting power corrections in @xmath39 , the hadronic matrix elements can be factorized into hard radiative corrections and a nonperturbative part parameterized by the form factors and meson light cone distribution amplitudes . in the following",
    "we will outline their reasoning .",
    "first , we need to have some knowledge about the end - point behavior of the light cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of the mesons . at the scale of @xmath14 ,",
    "the lcdas of the final light mesons  for example @xmath40 of @xmath41 or @xmath42 mesons  should be similar to the asymptotic form .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that the end - point of the lcdas of the light mesons is suppressed by @xmath43 . for b mesons ,",
    "the spectator quark is assumed to be soft and have no hard tail , i.e. , @xmath44 , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for @xmath47 . with the above assumptions ,",
    "the form factor is argued to be nonperturbative dominant ; thereafter , naive power counting rules are constructed and the leading power radiative contributions in @xmath39 can be identified ( see fig .",
    "corrections to the hard scattering kernels .",
    "the upward quark lines represent the emission meson from the b quark decay vertex .",
    "these diagrams are commonly called vertex corrections , penguin corrections and hard spectator scattering diagrams for ( a)-(d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , and ( g ) and ( h ) , respectively.,width=680,height=302 ]    notice that , in fig .",
    "1 , the emission meson from the decay vertex carries large energy and momentum ( about @xmath48 ) and therefore can be described by leading twist-2 lcda in the leading power approximation .",
    "for factorization to be held , these radiative contributions should be hard dominant . for vertex corrections ( figs .",
    "1(a)-1(d ) ) , every individual diagram contains infrared divergence , but these infrared divergences are canceled after summation .",
    "this cancellation is not accidental .",
    "intuitively , the @xmath49 pair of the energenic emission meson can be viewed as a small color dipole . since soft gluons can not taste the difference between a small color dipole and a color singlet , the emission meson decouples with the soft gluon interaction .",
    "this argument is well known as `` color transparency '' @xcite .",
    "technically , not only soft divergence but also collinear divergence is canceled . for penguin corrections ( figs . 1(e ) and 1(f ) ) and hard spectator scattering ( figs .",
    "1(g ) and 1(h ) ) , since the end point of the twist-2 lcda of the light meson is @xmath43 suppressed , it is not difficult to show hard dominance .",
    "so factorization does hold in the heavy quark limit , and the corresponding formula can be explicitly expressed as @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above formula , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the leading twist wave functions of b and the light mesons , respectively , and @xmath53 denote hard scattering kernels which are perturbatively calculable .",
    "the readers may refer to ref.@xcite for more details .",
    "one of the most interesting results of the qcdf approach is that , in the heavy quark limit , strong phases are short dominant and arise solely from vertex and penguin corrections which are at the order of @xmath17 .",
    "it means that , for charmless hadronic decays , direct cp violations are generally small because strong phases are @xmath17 suppressed compared to the leading `` naive factorization '' contributions .",
    "but in principle power corrections may also contribute to strong phases , and numerically @xmath54 is comparable to @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , there is no known systematic way to estimate power suppressed contributions ( note that soft collinear effective theory @xcite may be a potential tool ) , so qcdf could only predict strong phases qualitatively .      the above discussions are based on the heavy quark limit ; i.e. , power corrections in @xmath39 are assumed to be negligible . then the question is , for phenomenological applications , whether it is a good approximation .",
    "there are various sources which may contribute to power corrections in @xmath39 ; examples are higher twist distribution amplitudes , transverse momenta of quarks in the light meson , annihilation diagrams , etc . at first sight ,",
    "power corrections seem really small because they are suppressed by @xmath55 . however , this is not true .",
    "for instance , the contributions of operator @xmath56 to decay amplitudes would formally vanish in the strict heavy quark limit .",
    "but it is numerically very important in penguin - dominated b rare decays , such as the interesting @xmath57 decays .",
    "this is because @xmath56 is always multiplied by a formally power - suppressed but chirally enhanced factor @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are current quark masses .",
    "another example is annihilation topology ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the importance of which was noticed first in the pqcd method @xcite",
    ". therefore phenomenological applicability of qcd factorization in b rare decays requires at least a consistent inclusion of chirally enhanced corrections and annihilation contributions .",
    "corrections to the weak annihilations.,width=604,height=151 ]    chirally enhanced corrections arise from twist-3 light cone distribution amplitudes ; thus , the final light mesons should be described by leading twist and twist-3 distribution amplitudes .",
    "then we need to redemonstrate that the leading power radiative corrections ( fig . 1 ) are still dominated by hard gluon exchange .",
    "unfortunately it is not true for hard spectator scattering which contains logarithmic divergence in the end - point region .",
    "a similar divergence also appears in the annihilation contributions .",
    "it means that , strictly speaking , factorization does not hold for chirally enhanced corrections and annihilation topology .",
    "the readers may refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for more technical details .",
    "phenomenologically , beneke _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a model parametrization for the end - point divergence : @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the annihilation contribution and @xmath63 denotes hard spectator scattering .",
    "we will follow their approach in this paper .    for the rest of the power corrections , they are argued to be generally small @xcite based on a model estimation with renormalon calculus .    with the above discussions , the decay amplitudes can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the factorized hadronic matrix element which has the same definition as that in the naive factorization approach . for the explicit expressions of qcd coefficients @xmath66 and annihilation parameters @xmath67 , the readers may refer to refs .",
    "@xcite . between ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite .",
    "this is due to a subtle point relating to some divergent boundary terms in a process of integration by part @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the expression of @xmath68 from ref.@xcite . ]",
    "the decay amplitude for @xmath69 depends on various parameters , such as the ckm matrix elements , decay constants , form factors , renormalization scale @xmath70 , lcdas , and so on .",
    "notice that although the predictions of qcdf are formally scale independent at one - loop order , numerically there is still a small residual dependence . in the global fit",
    ", the scale @xmath70 is varied from @xmath71 to @xmath72 . for the rest of the parameters",
    ", we will specify them in the following .",
    "the ckm matrix in the wolfenstein parametrization is read as @xmath73 it contains four parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in which the first two are well determined @xcite : @xmath78 as to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , they are kept free except for the constraint @xmath79 @xcite and @xmath80 ( world averaged ) @xcite .",
    "the form factors and decay constants are nonperturbative parameters .",
    "the form factors can be extracted from the semileptonic decays and/or estimated with some well - defined theories , such as lattice calculations , qcd sum rules , etc .",
    "but the related errors are still sizable .",
    "the decay constants can be extracted from the leptonic or electromagnetic decay width with high precision . in the fit ,",
    "we choose the corresponding numerical values as follows @xcite : @xmath81 where @xmath82 . in the above , we assume ideal mixing between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , i.e. , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . as for @xmath87 mixing , we follow the convention in the quark - flavor basis @xcite and assume that the charm quark content in @xmath88 is negligible , @xmath89 where the four octet - singlet parameters can be related to three quark - flavor parameters : @xmath90      the lcdas of the mesons are basic input parameters in the qcdf approach .",
    "the lcdas of a light pseudoscalar meson are defined as @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) is leading twist ( twist-3 ) lcda , and @xmath95 ( here @xmath59 and @xmath60 are current masses of the valence quarks of the pseudoscalar meson ) .",
    "because the current masses of light quarks are difficult to fix , we would like to take @xmath96 which is numerically a good approximation .",
    "for the related quark masses , we shall follow ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath97    for vector mesons , only longitudinal polarization is involved in @xmath22 decays .",
    "furthermore , the contributions of twist-3 lcdas of vector mesons are doubly suppressed by @xmath17 and @xmath43 ; therefore , they can be safely disregarded .",
    "then the leading twist lcda of a longitudinal vector meson is defined as @xcite @xmath98    we shall use the asymptotic forms of the lcdas for the following discussions : @xmath99 strictly speaking , the asymptotic forms are only valid for @xmath100 .",
    "we notice that in ref .",
    "@xcite , beneke _ et al .",
    "_ employ an expansion in gegenbauer polynomials for leading twist @xmath101 lcdas .",
    "however , since there are many light mesons involved in our global fit , if we consider a similar expansion for the leading twist lcdas , many free parameters would be introduced .",
    "fortunately , the corrections to the asymptotic form are numerically not so important because they only affect part of the vertex and penguin corrections ( numerically , the readers may refer to table 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite to see the effects of the gegenbauer expansion ) .",
    "so for simplification , only the asymptotic forms are used in our discussions .    for the wave function of the b meson",
    ", only the moment @xmath102 appears in the factorization formulas .",
    "we do not know much about the parameter @xmath103 and the estimation of ref .",
    "@xcite is quoted : @xmath104 .",
    "in this work , the global analysis is based on the ckmfitter package developed by hcker _",
    "the original package includes @xmath105 ( @xmath106 or @xmath42 ) decay channels , and we enlarge it to include @xmath22 and @xmath107 decay modes .",
    "the rfit scheme is implemented for statistical treatment .",
    "simply speaking , the rfit scheme assumes the experimental errors to be pure gaussians ( if the systematic errors are not so large ) while the theoretical parameters vary freely in a given range . in this spirit , it is similar to the @xmath108 scan method .",
    "one of the main differences is that the overall @xmath109 is assumed to be gaussian distributed in the @xmath108 scan method , while for the rfit scheme , the confidence level of the overal @xmath109 is computed by means of a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the readers may refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for details about the rfit scheme . as to the qcdf expressions for the related decay amplitudes",
    ", the readers may refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for b @xmath110 pp decays and @xcite for b @xmath110 pv decays .    compared with pqcd , qcdf requires more input parameters , such as form factors , annihilation parameter @xmath62 , hard spectator parameter @xmath63 , and so on . to make the global analysis appear more persuasive and at the same time save computing time , we minimize the number of variables by fixing those insensitive parameters .",
    "one example is that we shall use the asymptotic forms of the lcdas for all final light mesons , and not employ an expansion in gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "since power corrections violate factorization , the parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 are introduced as a model parameterization .",
    "but we should be care that , in principle , these parameters are channel dependent . fortunately , assuming `` factorized '' su(3 ) breaking , we can see that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are universal separately for @xmath0 and @xmath22 decay modes .",
    "however , there is no way to relate the chiral parameters of the @xmath1 channels to those of the @xmath111 channels .",
    "so we have to introduce , besides @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the additional parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath22 decays .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , beneke _ et al .",
    "_ present a detailed analysis of @xmath116 , @xmath21 with the qcdf approach .",
    "they show an impressive agreement between experiments and the qcdf predictions : @xmath117 for six decay channels .",
    "their best fit results favor @xmath2 around @xmath118 which seems not so consistent with the standard global fit of the ckm matrix elements using information from semileptonic b decays , @xmath42-@xmath119 mixing and @xmath120-@xmath121 mixing . even for @xmath2 around @xmath122 , @xmath123 is still good enough to be acceptable . in qcdf , these six decay channels are sensitive to several input parameters : the ckm parameters @xmath124 and angle @xmath2 ( or equivalently @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , form factors @xmath125 and @xmath126 , annihilation - related parameters @xmath62 and @xmath127 , and current quark mass @xmath128 .",
    "these parameters vary freely only in a given range which is either determined by experimental measurements ( @xmath124 ) , estimations with qcd sum rules and/or lattice calculations ( form factors and decay constants ) , or well - educated guesswork ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "so it is really nontrivial for the achieved agreement between the qcdf predictions and the experimental measurements .    in this work",
    ", we will extend the global analysis to include 14 @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay modes ( see table 1 ) .",
    "notice that the hard spectator parameter @xmath63 is numerically unimportant for the branching ratios except for @xmath129-related tree - dominated decays @xcite , and even for @xmath129-related decays , it brings at most @xmath130 uncertainties .",
    "so compared with the global analysis of @xmath38 , @xmath21 @xcite , our extension would include seven @xmath22 channels and newly observed @xmath131 decay , while only three new sensitive parameters  the form factor @xmath132 and complex variable @xmath114  would be involved .",
    "therefore we can have a more stringent test of the qcdf predictions which should give some interesting information .",
    "recently babar and belle also gave a strong constraint on direct cp violations for many charmless hadronic b decay channels .",
    "their search show that direct cp - violating asymmetries are generally small . within the qcdf framework , strong phases are either @xmath17 or @xmath43 suppressed , which also lead to small direct cp violations in general",
    ". however , only radiative corrections are perturbatively computable in qcdf , while power corrections break the factorization in general . considering that @xmath43 is numerically comparable with @xmath17 , the qcdf calculations on direct cp violations are probably qualitative .",

    "we find that , compared with the estimation @xmath141 @xcite ( including @xmath142 breaking effects ) , the global fit prefers a suprisingly large value : @xmath143 .",
    "the reason may be that penguin annihilation effects increase the penguin amplitudes , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "considering the relatively large model dependence of this ratio within the qcdf framework , the best fit value may be not so meaningful to reduce the ambiguity in the determination of @xmath144 .",

    "the best fit value for @xmath10 decay is @xmath162 which is consistent with the belle observation but larger than the upper limit given by babar .",

    "one might argue that the observed @xmath165 decay also depends on the form factor @xmath164 .",
    "but this decay channel requires a new annihilation parameter @xmath166 for @xmath167 decays .",

    "notice that @xmath171 , and large cancellation occurs which leads to a much smaller branching ratio compared with the experimental data .",
    "but we do not worry about it due to several reasons .",
    "* first , it relates to the special property of @xmath88 which has anomaly coupling to two gluons .",
    "specifically , the digluon fusion mechanism @xcite where one gluon comes from the @xmath172 decay vertex and the other from the spectator quark , is presumed to account for the large branching ratios of @xmath173 decays .",
    "although it is arguable whether the digluon mechanism is perturbatively calculable or not , the contribution should be proportional to the coupling @xmath174 . as we know that @xmath175 this means that @xmath176 where @xmath177 denotes the amplitude of the digluon fusion mechanism .",
    "so if the digluon mechanism were important for @xmath173 , it should be also important for @xmath178 .",
    "* second , we know that when the leading power terms are abnormally small , the next - to - leading power contributions become potentially important . remembering that there is no known systematic way to estimate power corrections , the qcdf estimation of this channel is probably correct only at the order of magnitude .",
    "* recently , beneke @xcite propose a novel possibility : for the annihilation contributions , two gluons may radiate from the spectator quark and form a @xmath88 meson . in this case , it is the leading power contribution .",
    "furthermore , it breaks the factorization and therefore a new nonperturbative parameter is needed to parameterize its contribution .    from the above discussions , it is clear that theoretically great efforts are needed to quantitatively understand @xmath179 decays .",
    "the real trouble is @xmath11 decays .",
    "let us take @xmath180 as an example . in qcdf , approximately we have @xmath181 assuming @xmath182 , then @xmath183 so @xmath184 should be smaller than or at most comparable with @xmath185 . unfortunately , the updated experimental measurements do not support it : @xmath186 general speaking , we do not anticipate any novel mechanism for this channel because it would have a similar influence on @xmath187 decays .",
    "so presently there is nothing we can do from the qcdf side . with the global fit",
    ", the confidence level for @xmath11 is displayed in fig .",
    "4 , from which we can see that @xmath184 is comparable with @xmath185 as expected .",
    "the preferred branching ratios are somewhat smaller than the experimental measurements for both @xmath188 and @xmath189 modes .",
    "fortunately the current experimental errors are quite large .",
    "we anticipate that further precise measurements would prefer smaller branching ratios for these two decay channels .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , although there are essential difference between the pqcd and qcdf methods , pqcd also predicts that @xmath184 is comparable with @xmath185 @xcite , which is about @xmath190 .",
    "qcd factorization is a promising method for charmless two - body b decays , which are crucial for the determination of the unitarity triangle . with the successful running of b factories , many @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay modes",
    "have been observed .",
    "we can do a global analysis to check whether the predictions of the qcd factorization are consistent with the measurements .",
    "since there are many parameters involved in the global analysis , we try to minimize the number of free qcd parameters to make the global analysis appear more persuasive .",
    "hence , the asymptotic forms are used for the light cone distribution amplitudes of the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons . for chirally enhanced parameters , it is a good approximation to take @xmath191 .",
    "assuming `` factorized '' su(3 ) breaking , the chirally enhanced parameters @xmath136 are separately universal for @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "however , @xmath192 and @xmath193 are independent parameters because there is no approximate symmetry to relate @xmath0 and @xmath194 decays .    with the above set of parameters",
    ", we enlarged the ckmfitter package to include more charmless decay channels and did a global analysis .",
    "it is shown that the qcdf predictions are basically in good agreement with the experiments .",
    "it is encouraging to see that the favored angle @xmath2 is roughly consistent with the standard ckm global fit .",
    "it is quite interesting to see that the chirally enhanced corrections may play an important role in penguin - dominated @xmath22 decays .",
    "the penguin - to - tree ratio @xmath195 is important for the extraction of the ckm angle @xmath12 .",
    "the global analysis favors this ratio to be larger than @xmath6 with @xmath196 per number of degree smaller than 1 .",
    "notice that the observed decays @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath160 , @xmath10 are not included in the analysis . in this paper we discussed these decay channels in detail . among these channels ,",
    "only the decays @xmath11 are somewhat troublesome . in qcdf , @xmath184 should be smaller than or at most comparable with @xmath200 ) , which is not so consistent with experimental observations .",
    "in fact , the global analysis prefers somewhat smaller branching ratios for both @xmath188 and @xmath189 decay modes .",
    "fortunately the related experimental errors are quite large at present ; it is anticipated that further measurements with higher precision would observe smaller branching ratios .",
    "we also gave the confidence levels for some selected decay channels : @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath201 .",
