    "biological invasions of alien species are commonly divided into three stages : arrival , establishment , and expansion ( liebhold and tobin 2008 ) .",
    "the precise circumstances of an alien species arrival , which refers to the transport of an alien species to new areas outside of its native range , are generally not known and are not the purpose of this article .",
    "the establishment stage refers to a growth phase of the population density up to some threshold above which it is usually assumed that natural extinction is highly unlikely .",
    "however , if during the expansion stage , which refers to the spreading of the alien species to nearby new areas , the population expands in space through dispersal without significantly increasing its size , thus leading to a drop of its density , there might be a risk of extinction for species subject to an allee effect .",
    "the allee effect refers to a certain process that leads to decreasing net population growth with decreasing density , thus inducing the existence of a so - called allee threshold below which populations are driven toward extinction .",
    "the causes of allee effect identified by ecologists are numerous .",
    "they include failure to locate mates ( hopper and roush 1993 ; berec _ et al _ 2001 ) , inbreeding depression ( lande 1998 ) , failure to satiate predators ( gascoigne and lipcius 2004 ) , lack of cooperative feeding ( clark and faeth 1997 ) , etc .",
    "stochasticity , e.g. , demographic and/or environmental stochasticity , may also play an important role during the critical time period when an alien species already established in one area starts to spread its population into a new area through dispersal . in this article , we think of the establishment stage as a local expansion of the population in a given geographical location , which involves an increase of population density in this location , while we think of the expansion stage as a global expansion of the population in space into nearby geographical locations regardless of its density .",
    "we call a global expansion successful if it leads to the population being established in nearby geographical locations , and unsuccessful if on the contrary the population fails to get established in new locations which may also lead to a global extinction ( the population goes extinct in all patches ) . the main purpose of this article is to study the critical time period when a species already established in a specific geographical location starts to expand in space , and determine whether the expansion stage is successful or not . both allee effect and stochasticity",
    "are central to better understand why some alien species successfully expand into new geographical areas , and there has been recently a growing recognition of the importance of these two components in biological invasions ( drake 2004 ; leung _ et al _ 2004 ; taylor and hastings 2005 ; ackleh _ et al _ 2007 ) .",
    "understanding their role and strength is of critical importance to gain some insight into why some species are more invasive than others , and may suggest some proper biological control strategies to regulate some populations ( liebhold and tobin 2008 ) .",
    "if an alien species subject to an allee effect establishes its population in one area , i.e. , its population is above the allee threshold in this area , then the first step of population expansion is to spread to a nearby new area where the population is either absent or at least below the allee threshold . a natural way to model this situation is to consider a two - patch model with heterogeneous initial conditions such that    1 .",
    "both patches are coupled by interacting through dispersal , and 2 .   in the absence of interactions , i.e. , when the patches are uncoupled , the initial conditions lead to establishment in one patch and extinction in the other patch .",
    "this approach has been used previously by alder ( 1993 ) and kang _",
    "et al _ ( 2009 ) . in this article , we follow this modeling strategy to study the global expansion ( population above the threshold in both patches ) and global extinction ( population below the threshold in both patches ) of an alien species subject to an allee effect during the critical time period between the establishment stage and the expansion stage by employing both a deterministic two - patch model and its stochastic analog",
    ". the objectives of our study are twofold : the first is to study the consequences of the inclusion of dispersal and allee effect on the extinction and expansion for both deterministic and stochastic models with heterogeneous initial conditions ; the second is to understand the effects of stochasticity by comparing the results based on both models .",
    "there is a copious amount of literature on the invasion and extinction of populations subject to allee effects ( e.g. , dennis 1989 , 2002 ; veit and lewis 1996 ; mccarthy 1997 ; shigesada and kawasaki 1997 ; greene and stamps 2001 ; keitt _ et al _ 2001 ; fagan _ et al _ 2002 ; wang _ et al _ 2002 ; liebhold and bascompte 2003 ; schreiber 2003 ; zhou _ et al _ 2004 ; petrovskii _ et al _ 2005 ; taylor and hastings 2005 ) which also includes various models in patchy environment ( e.g. , amarasekare 1998a , 1998b ; gyllenberg _ et al _ 1999 ; ackleh _ et al _ 2007 ; kang _ et al _ 2009 ) .    in the deterministic side , amarasekare ( 1998a , 1998b ) investigated how an interaction between local density dependence , dispersal , and spatial heterogeneity influence population persistence in patchy environments .",
    "in particular , she studied how allee ( or allee - like ) effects arise from these patchy models . gyllenberg _",
    "et al _ ( 1999 ) studied a deterministic model of a symmetric two - patch metapopulation to determine conditions that allow the allee effect to conserve and create spatial heterogeneities in population densities .",
    "rather than exploring the global dynamics of their models , both amarasekare ( 1998a , 1998b ) and gyllenberg _ et al _ ( 1999 ) studied the influence of an allee effect on local dynamics , e.g. , number of equilibriums and local stability .",
    "there are few studies regarding the influence of an allee effect on the extinction versus expansion of populations in patchy environments ( e.g. , ackleh _ et al _ 2007 ; kang _ et al _ 2009 ) .",
    "et al _ ( 2009 ) studied the influence of an _ allee - like effect _ for a discrete - time two - patch model on plant - herbivore interactions where patches are coupled through a dispersal .",
    "their study suggests that for a certain range of dispersal parameters the population of herbivores in both patches drops under the allee threshold , thus leading to an extinction of the herbivores in both patches , for the majority of positive initial conditions .    in the stochastic side , the recent work by ackleh _",
    "et al _ ( 2007 ) focuses on a multi - patch population model combining stochasticity and allee effect .",
    "their numerical simulations show that populations with initial sizes below but near their allee threshold in each patch can still become established and invasive if stochastic processes affect life history parameters .",
    "the closer the population to its allee threshold , the greater the probability of invasion . a more theoretical approach based on interacting particle systems can be found in krone ( 1999 ) . in his model , each site of the infinite integer lattice has to be thought of as a patch which is either empty , occupied by a small colony with a high risk of going extinct , or occupied by a full colony with a longer life span .",
    "if successful , a small colony gets established to become a full colony , while empty patches get colonized by a small colony due to invasions from adjacent full colonies , making space explicit .    in this paper , although we model the population dynamics deterministically following the approach of amarasekare ( 1998a , 1998b ) , gyllenberg _ et al _ ( 1999 ) and ackleh _ et al _ ( 2007 ) , our stochastic process as well as analytical results for both models are new . for the deterministic model ,",
    "our focus is on the global dynamics of the system combining dispersal and allee effects .",
    "in particular , we give analytical results on how allee threshold and dispersal affect the geometry of the basins of attraction of the stable equilibriums .",
    "the stochastic model is derived from the deterministic one using a process that has two absorbing states corresponding to global extinction and global expansion , which allows to have a rigorous definition of successful invasion . in particular , our model is designed to study analytically the probability that a fully occupied patch successfully invade a nearby empty patch .",
    "to gain insight into the effects of stochasticity on the population dynamics , we will compare in details the results obtained for both models .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : deterministic ] , we introduce the deterministic two - patch model with allee effect coupled by dispersal .",
    "based on the analysis of the invariant sets , we give a complete picture of the global dynamics of the system including the existence of the nontrivial locally stable equilibriums and the geometry of their basin of attraction .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed to gain some insight into how dispersal and allee threshold affect the exact basin of attraction of the equilibriums . in section  [ sec : stochastic ] , we introduce and analyze mathematically the stochastic model focusing on the time to fixation of the process , the existence of metastable states and the probability of a successful invasion when starting from heterogeneous initial conditions .",
    "simulations of the stochastic model have also been performed to better understand these aspects . in section [ sec :",
    "comparison ] , we compare the predictions based on both models , and describe the biological implications of our analytical and numerical results . finally , section [ sec : proofs ] is devoted proofs .",
    "the first step in constructing the deterministic two - patch model is to consider single - species dynamics including an allee affect as potential candidates to describe the evolution in a single patch .",
    "the two - patch model is then naturally derived by looking at a two - dimensional system in which both components are coupled through dispersal .",
    "the ecological dynamics of a single species population subject to an allee effect that can mimic the dynamics in the absence of dispersal is usually described by the model @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the population density at time @xmath2 .",
    "the function @xmath3 measures the logistic component of population growth , which is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the per capita intrinsic growth rate and @xmath6 measures the extra mortality caused by intraspecific competition .",
    "in general , the bistability of the differential equation is triggered by combining the negative density - dependence of the logistic growth @xmath3 with the positive density - dependence of an additional demographic factor represented here by the function @xmath7 .",
    "the decreasing reproduction due to a shortage of mating encountered in low population density and the decreasing mortality due to the weakening predation risk in higher population density are two important examples of such factors ( stephens and sutherland 1999 ) which , following dercole _ et al _ ( 2003 ) , can be modeled by a holling type ii functional response : @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting population model creates , under suitable parameter values , a threshold below which the population goes extinct eventually and above which the population density approaches a positive equilibrium .",
    "the simplest and generic model that captures the population dynamics of a single species with allee effects can be described by @xmath9 where @xmath5 is the per capita intrinsic growth rate after rescaling and @xmath10 is a threshold that lies between 0 and 1 after rescaling .",
    "the latter , called allee threshold , determines whether the population goes extinct or establishes itself .",
    "more precisely , the population dynamics of can be summarized as follows .",
    "[ l_sae ] if the population of a single species is described by , then it goes extinct when @xmath11 while its density goes to 1 when @xmath12 .",
    "thinking of model as describing the population dynamics in one patch , the dynamics of two interacting identical patches with dispersal @xmath13 can be modeled by @xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] is a dispersal parameter , representing the fraction of population migrating from one patch to another per unit of time .",
    "although the system - is symmetric in @xmath16 and @xmath17 , asymmetry will be introduced by considering different initial conditions in each patch : @xmath18 . we will pay a particular attention to situations where one patch is initially below and the other patch above the allee threshold , in which case , in the absence of dispersal , the population goes extinct in the first patch but establishes itself in the second one .",
    "the main objective is to understand , based on analytical and numerical results , how the dispersal parameter @xmath13 and the allee threshold @xmath10 affect the global dynamics , i.e. , the limit sets of the system - and the geometry of their basin of attraction .",
    "our analytical results suggest the following picture of the global dynamics .",
    "recall first that , in the absence of dispersal , the system has four locally stable equilibrium points , which correspond to cases when the population in each patch either goes extinct or gets established . in the presence of dispersal , the existence of ( stable ) limit cycles",
    "is also excluded : starting from almost every initial condition in @xmath19 , the system converges to an equilibrium point .",
    "this is partly proved analytically in theorem [ th : simple ] and supported by the numerical simulations of figure [ fig : ode ] .",
    "therefore , we focus our attention on the existence , stability and basins of attraction of the equilibrium points .",
    "the effects of the dispersal parameter and the value of the allee threshold are as follows .",
    "first , the dynamics of the deterministic two - patch model in the presence of weak dispersal are similar to that of the uncoupled system , having four locally stable equilibriums ( theorem [ th : attractors ] ) , i.e. , the extinction state @xmath20 , the expansion state @xmath21 and two asymmetric interior equilibriums @xmath22 , @xmath23 , which is not retained after the inclusion of demographic stochasticity , which induces two absorbing states and two metastable states . while increasing the dispersal parameter from 0 , the basin of attraction of the extinction state @xmath20 and expansion state @xmath21 increase until a certain critical value at which both patches interact enough to synchronize , which drives the system to either global extinction @xmath20 or global expansion @xmath21 : there are only two attractors ( theorems [ th : basin ] and [ th : attractors ] ) . above this critical value",
    ", dispersal promotes extinction when the allee threshold is below one half but promotes survival when the allee threshold is above one half ( theorems [ th : basin ] and [ th : dispersal ] ) .",
    "finally , in the presence of a strong dispersal , both patches synchronize fast enough so that the global dynamics reduce to that of a single - patch model : if the initial global density , i.e. , the average of the densities in both patches , is below the allee threshold then the population goes extinct whereas if it exceeds the allee threshold then the population expands globally ( theorem [ th : dispersal ] ) .",
    "in other respects , for any value of the dispersal parameter , increasing the allee threshold promotes extinction , and populations initially below the allee threshold in both patches are doomed to extinction , whereas populations initially above the allee threshold in both patches expand globally .",
    "these results are stated rigorously in the following two subsections .",
    "simulation results and detailed summary are given in the last subsection .      in order to understand the global dynamics of the deterministic two - patch model ,",
    "the first step is to identify its omega limit sets .",
    "since the model is simply a two - dimensional ode , its omega limit sets are either equilibrium points or limit cycles according to the poincar - bendixson theorem . as stated in the next theorem ,",
    "when the dispersal parameter is sufficiently large , an application of the dulac s criterion reveals simple dynamics by excluding the existence of limit cycles : for any initial condition , the system converges to an equilibrium point .",
    "[ th : simple ] for any @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , if @xmath27 then every trajectory of - converges to an equilibrium point .",
    "theorem [ th : simple ] indicates for instance that every trajectory of the system - converges to an equilibrium point under the condition @xmath28 if one takes @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , theorem [ th : basin ] below implies that if limit cycles emerge for smaller values of the dispersal parameter then each of them is included in one of the two regions of the phase space in which the population lies above the allee threshold in one patch but below the allee threshold in the other patch , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "numerical simulations ( see figure [ fig : ode ] ) further suggest that , for any value of the dispersal parameter , there is no stable limit cycle , which implies that locally stable equilibriums are the only possible attractors of the system , so we focus our attention on the existence , stability and basins of attraction of the equilibrium points .",
    "we also would like to point out that if the system has no allee effect , e.g. , a metapopulation model coupled by both competition and migration with uniparental reproduction , then this system admits no periodic solutions ( proposition 1 in gyllenberg _ et al _ 1999 ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that the system - has three symmetric equilibriums for all positive values of the parameters : one boundary equilibrium given by @xmath32 and two interior equilibriums given respectively by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "for obvious reasons , we call @xmath35 the extinction state of the system and @xmath36 the expansion state .",
    "theorem [ th : basin ] below indicate that , for all parameter values , these two trivial equilibriums are locally stable whereas the interior equilibrium point @xmath37 is unstable . hence , to understand the global dynamics of the system , the next step is to study the geometry of the basins of attraction of the two trivial equilibriums , i.e. , @xmath38 letting @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the subsets @xmath41 lemma [ l_sae ] indicates that , in the absence of dispersal , the basins of attraction of @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the ( uncoupled ) system are given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the following theorem shows how the inclusion of a dispersal affects the basins of attraction .",
    "[ th : basin ]    1 .",
    "the extinction state @xmath35 and expansion state @xmath36 are always locally stable whereas the interior fixed point @xmath37 is always unstable .",
    "2 .   if @xmath44 then @xmath37 is a saddle while if @xmath45 then @xmath37 is a source .",

    "if in addition @xmath47 then @xmath48 4 .   @xmath49 .",
    "if in addition @xmath50 then @xmath51    theorem [ th : basin ] indicates that the inclusion of dispersal promotes both global extinction and global expansion of the system , as the basins of attraction of both equilibrium points @xmath35 and @xmath36 are larger in the presence than in the absence of dispersal .",
    "numerical simulations further suggest that , up to a certain critical value , increasing the dispersal parameter translates into an increase of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the value of the allee threshold @xmath10 also plays an important role in the global dynamics .",
    "when the allee threshold lies below one half , which is common in nature , the largest possible basin of attraction of @xmath35 is @xmath54 moreover , according to numerical simulations ( see figure [ fig : ode ] ) , increasing the allee threshold promotes extinction of the system in the sense that , the dispersal parameter being fixed , the smaller the allee threshold , the smaller the basin attraction of the extinction state @xmath35 and the larger the basin attraction of the expansion state @xmath36 .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that parts 1 and 2 of the theorem hold for the system - but not always for two - patch models with allee effect .",
    "a counter example is provided by the metapopulation model coupled by both competition and migration with biparental reproduction studied by gyllenberg _",
    "et al _ ( 1999 ) .",
    "the first step to prove parts 3 and 4 of theorem [ th : basin ] will be to identify the positive invariant sets of the system - included into the upper right quadrant @xmath31 .",
    "recall that a set is called positive invariant if any trajectory starting from this set stays in this set at all future times .",
    "since we are interested in the global dynamics of the system , our objective will be to find all the possible invariant sets in @xmath55 .",
    "notice that the union and the intersect of positive invariant sets are also positive invariant .",
    "all these positive invariant sets have an important role in understanding the dynamics in regions of the phase space where the population is below the allee threshold in one patch but above the allee threshold in the other patch .",
    "in particular , they will give us means of decomposing the phase space by restricting our attention to the dynamics on each invariant set and then sewing together a global solution from the invariant pieces .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the effects of the dispersal parameter on the dynamics of the two - patch model when the allee threshold is fixed .",
    "theorem [ th : simple ] suggests that the number of attractors is also equal to the number of locally stable equilibriums .",
    "our study shows that the value of the dispersal parameter determines the number of equilibriums , thus the possible number of attractors .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the stable manifold of the unstable interior equilibrium @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath57 the following theorem indicates that , when the dispersal is sufficiently large , both patches interact enough to synchronize , which drives the system to either global extinction or global expansion : there are only two stable equilibriums , the extinction state @xmath35 and the expansion state @xmath36 .",
    "[ th : dispersal ] assume that @xmath58 then , the system - has only two attractors : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "if @xmath50 and holds then @xmath60    if the inequality holds , we can consider that the system has a very strong dispersal .",
    "then theorem [ th : dispersal ] indicates that , when @xmath47 , both patches synchronize fast enough so that the global dynamics reduce to the one of a single - patch model : if the initial global density , i.e. , the average of the densities in both patches , is below the allee threshold then the population goes extinct whereas if it exceeds the allee threshold then the population expands globally .",
    "in addition , the theoretical results in theorems [ th : basin ] and [ th : dispersal ] , suggest that the smaller the allee threshold , the smaller the basin of attraction of the extinction state and the larger the basin of attraction of the expansion state . this agrees with the simulation results of figure [ fig : ode ] .    finally , in order to explore the number of locally stable equilibriums when the dispersal is small , we now look at the nullclines of the system .",
    "define @xmath61 then , the nullclines of the system - are given by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the interior equilibriums are determined by the positive roots of @xmath64 , which is a polynomial with degree 9 .",
    "this implies that the system has at most 8 interior equilibriums since 0 is always a solution .",
    "according to the expression of the nullclines @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( see figure [ fig : nullclines ] page ) , we can see that the number of interior equilibriums strongly depends upon the value of the dispersal parameter : in the presence of strong dispersal , both patches synchronize and the system has only two positive interior equilibriums @xmath37 and @xmath36 , which is confirmed by theorem [ th : dispersal ] , while in the presence of weak dispersal , there is enough independence between both patches so that the system has 8 positive interior equilibriums .",
    "we are interested in the locally stable equilibriums since the possible number of attractors is intimately connected to the number of stable equilibriums .",

    "part 1 of theorem [ th : attractors ] suggests that we can restrict our analysis of the basin of attraction of locally stable equilibriums to the compact space @xmath78 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "moreover , from theorem [ th : attractors ] , we can see that when the dispersal parameter is small enough , the system has 9 equilibriums , including four locally stable equilibriums . in the presence of an allee effect",
    ", small dispersal may promote survival : patches that are below the allee threshold are rescued by immigrants from adjacent patches above the allee threshold .",
    "this implies that when dispersal is introduced to a system with an allee effect , populations can exist at intermediate densities , corresponding to the equilibriums @xmath77 and @xmath23 , as a source - sink system , or expand to high density @xmath36 .",

    "in particular , while their stochastic model is designed to study numerically the probability that a population starting near the allee threshold in each patch gets successfully established , our model is designed to study analytically the probability that a fully occupied patch successfully invade a nearby empty patch .",
    "more precisely , to understand the effect of stochasticity on the interactions between both patches , we introduce a markov jump process that , similarly to the deterministic model , keeps track of the evolution of the population size in each patch . to obtain a markov process ,",
    "the state is updated at random times represented by the points of a poisson process with a certain intensity making the times between consecutive updates independent exponentially distributed random variables . motivated by the fact that the unit square @xmath105 ^ 2 $ ] is positive invariant for the deterministic model , we will choose this set as the state space , i.e. , the state at time @xmath2 is a random vector @xmath106 , where the first and second coordinates represent the population size in the first and second patch , respectively .",
    "following the deterministic model , the stochastic dynamics involve three mechanisms : expansion , extinction , and migration .",
    "to model the presence of an allee affect , we again introduce a threshold parameter @xmath26 that can be seen as a critical size under which the population undergoes extinction and above which the population undergoes expansion , i.e. , allee threshold .",
    "this aspect is modeled by assuming that each component of the stochastic process jumps independently at rate @xmath25 to either 0 ( extinction ) or 1 ( expansion ) depending on whether it lies below or above the allee threshold . recall that an event `` happens at rate @xmath5 '' if the probability that it happens during a short time interval of length @xmath107 approaches @xmath108 as @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , expansion and extinction are formally described by the conditional probabilities @xmath110 this is also equivalent to saying that the waiting time for an expansion or an extinction is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath111 .",
    "given that the population size in a given patch is at the allee threshold , we flip a fair coin to decide whether an expansion or an extension event occurs at that patch which , in view of well - known properties of poisson processes , implies that @xmath112 to understand the effects of inter - patch interactions on the evolution of the system , we also include migration events consisting of the displacement of a fraction @xmath13 of the population of each patch to the other patch .",
    "we assume that these events occur at the normalized rate 1 , therefore migrations are described by @xmath113 we refer to figure [ fig : dynamics ] for a schematic illustration of the dynamics , where dark rectangles represent parts of the populations which are interchanged in the event of a migration .",
    "to analyze mathematically the stochastic process , it will be useful to look at the model as a simple example of interacting particle system .",
    "interacting particle systems are continuous - time markov processes whose state space maps the vertex set of a connected graph into a set representing the possible states at each vertex .",
    "the evolution is described by local interactions as the rate of change at a given vertex only depends on the configuration in its neighborhood . in particular , the markov process @xmath114 can be seen as an interacting particle system evolving on a very simple graph that consists of only two vertices , representing both patches , connected by one edge , indicating that patches interact .",
    "the reason for looking at the stochastic model as an example of interacting particle system is that this will allow us to construct the process graphically from a collection of independent poisson processes based on an idea of harris ( 1972 ) , which is a powerful tool to analyze the process mathematically .",
    "we now describe in details the behavior of the process along with our main results .",
    "note that , considering a stochastic model rather than a deterministic one , the long - term behavior is described by a set of invariant measures on the state space rather than single point equilibriums .",
    "to the two trivial equilibriums of the deterministic model , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , correspond two invariant measures which are dirac measures that concentrate on those two points , respectively .",
    "these two measures are two absorbing states : the configuration in which both patches are empty and the configuration in which both patches are fully occupied .",
    "we call global extinction and global expansion the events that the process eventually fixates to the first and the second absorbing state , respectively . interestingly , to the two asymmetric equilibriums of the deterministic model in the presence of weak dispersal correspond two quasi - stationary distributions representing two metastable states of the stochastic process ( see theorem [ metastable ] ) : depending on the initial configuration , the transient behavior might be described by one of these two quasi - stationary distributions , but after a long random time in the presence of weak dispersal ( see theorem [ metastability ] ) , the system fixates to one of the two absorbing states , suggesting that situations predicted by the deterministic model in which a small population can live next to a large population are artificially stable .",
    "another important question is how stochasticity affects the geometry of the basins of attraction of the two absorbing states , although strictly speaking there is no basin of attraction for the stochastic model since the limiting behavior might be unpredictable , and how fast the system fixates .",
    "we will see that there is a set of initial configurations for which the limiting behavior of the stochastic process is predictable , and fixation to one of the two absorbing states occurs quickly ( see theorem [ fixation ] ) . starting from any other configuration , the limiting behavior becomes unpredictable in the sense that the process may reach any of the two absorbing states with positive probability . in the presence of weak dispersal , however , the limit is almost predictable in the sense that the probability that the system undergoes a global expansion after exiting one of its metastable states approaches zero or one ( see theorem [ probabilities ] ) . whether the system fixates to one or the other absorbing state strongly depends on the value of the allee threshold .",
    "the limit is less and less predictable and the time to fixation shorter and shorter as the dispersal parameter increases .      in order to describe rigorously the behavior of the stochastic model introduced above",
    ", our main objective is to estimate the times to fixation @xmath115 and the corresponding probabilities of fixation , @xmath116 as a function of the initial configuration and the three parameters of the system .",
    "as previously explained , in contrast with the deterministic model which can have up to four distinct attractors , with probability one , either global expansion or global extinction occurs for the stochastic process , i.e. , @xmath117 the state space can be divided into four subsets .",
    "starting from only two of these subsets the limit is predictable in the sense that @xmath118 we call an upper configuration any configuration of the system in which the population size in each patch exceeds the allee threshold , and a lower configuration any configuration in which the population size in each patch lies below the allee threshold .",
    "these sets are denoted respectively by @xmath119 note that the set of upper configurations is closed under the dynamics , i.e. , once the system hits an upper configuration , the configuration at any later time is also an upper configuration .",
    "this implies that , starting from an upper configuration , global expansion occurs with probability one .",
    "similarly , starting from a lower configuration , global extinction occurs with probability one . by representing the process graphically , the time to fixation",
    "can be computed explicitly , as stated in the following theorem .",

    "this result can be seen as the analog of theorem [ th : basin ] which states that the sets of upper and lower configurations are included in the basin of attraction of the equilibrium points @xmath36 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "theorem [ fixation ] also indicates that , when the rates at which expansions , extinctions , and migrations occur are of the same order , the expected time to fixation is quite short .      the long - term behavior of the process starting from a configuration which is neither an upper configuration nor a lower configuration is more difficult to study as the probabilities of global expansion and global extinction are both strictly positive , which we shall refer to as unpredictable behavior .",
    "we will prove that , in any case , the system hits either an upper or a lower configuration at a random time which is almost surely finite , after which it evolves as indicated by theorem [ fixation ] .",
    "hence , the time to fixation and probabilities of global expansion and extinction can be determined by estimating the hitting times @xmath121 and the corresponding hitting probabilities @xmath122 since theorem [ fixation ] implies that @xmath123 \\ = \\ { \\mathbb{e}}\\,[t ] \\",

    "since the system is symmetric , we shall assume that @xmath124 and @xmath125 but the proofs of our results easily extend to the more general case when @xmath126 recall that , starting from an upper configuration or a lower configuration , the time to fixation is rather small .",

    "however , due to stochasticity , the system reaches eventually an upper or a lower configuration , and then fixates rapidly .",

    "simulations also indicate that , the dispersal parameter being fixed , the probability of extinction increases as the allee threshold increases . although we omit the details of the proof ,",

    "in addition , the long - term behavior of the stochastic model becomes almost predictable in the sense that , with very high probability , the system will undergo a global expansion when the allee threshold lies below one half and a global extinction when the allee threshold exceeds one half , which is of primary importance to predict the destiny of heterogeneous two - patch systems in the presence of weak dispersal . while increasing the dispersal parameter ,",

    "our analysis of idealized two - patch models is an important first step to understand more realistic multi - patch systems .",

    "the predictions , based on the deterministic model in the presence of enough dispersal so that patches synchronize and on the stochastic model in the general case , that populations usually expand successfully when the allee threshold is small is due to the fact that only two patches interact . literally , the critical threshold @xmath153 has to be thought of as one divided by the number of patches .",
    "looking at a multi - patch model in which @xmath154 patches interact all together , our analytical results suggest that a critical behavior should emerge for allee thresholds near @xmath155 when starting with a population established in only one patch , and more generally the number of patches where the population is initially established divided by the number of interacting patches .",
    "therefore , even for realistic values of the allee threshold , the long - term behavior is no longer straightforward in the presence of a large number of patches .",
    "numerical simulations can also provide a valuable insight into the long - term behavior of multi - patch models including additional refinements such as density - dependent dispersals , heterogeneous environments with possibly different allee thresholds in different patches , and more importantly the inclusion of a spatial structure through a network of interactions represented by a two - dimensional regular lattice or more general planar graphs rather than a complete graph where patches interact all together .",
