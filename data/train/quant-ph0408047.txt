    "two - party systems described by gaussian states play an important role in quantum information @xcite , continuous - variables ( cv ) teleportation @xcite and cv entanglement @xcite .",
    "such states provide physical realizations of entangled cv resources , required to transmit quantum information in highly efficient quantum channels .",
    "the general theory of quantum separability for quantum gaussian squeezed states has been established recently in several papers @xcite .    in most theoretical applications squeezed two - mode gaussian states @xcite",
    "have been used as a physical realization of the original einstein podolsky rosen ( epr ) correlated wave function @xcite .",
    "such gaussian squeezed states can be generated in nonlinear optical parametric amplifiers or in four - wave - mixing processes @xcite .",
    "recently an efficient method used the kerr nonlinearity in optical fibers to generate squeezed entanglement in various variables , like phase and amplitude @xcite , polarization @xcite and photon - number @xcite .",
    "this experimental progress has stimulated various theoretical tools of diagnostics of cv states which can provide a measure of entanglement and squeezing of such states .",
    "so far we know that entanglement of such cv sates can be tested using the heisenberg uncertainty relations @xcite , the partial positivity transposition ( ppt ) criterion @xcite , the interference and particle counting @xcite , or using quantum witness operators @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to employ the hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) interference to witness the quantum nature of one - mode squeezed states and the quantum entanglement of two - mode gaussian squeezed states .",
    "this method seems to be rather easy experimentally realizable measuring second - order correlation function of light .",
    "we show that using hbt interference one can witness : classical and nonclassical properties of single mode gaussian squeezed states and test quantum features of two - mode uncorrelated squeezed states . with the help of hbt witness operator we study the entanglement of a general epr states obtained as a nonlocal action of the beam splitter on two input squeezed states .",
    "this witness operator is closely related to the hbt interference .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii is devoted to a review of well known properties of one - mode gaussian squeezed state ( gss ) .",
    "the fundamental properties of such state are derived .",
    "the @xmath0-representability condition is analyzed using a single mode quantum witness operator .",
    "relations with a recent experiment are discussed .",
    "section iii introduces hbt interference and discusses the classical versus quantum properties of the second - order visibility .",
    "a witnessing operator to detect quantum features of this second - order interference is introduced .",
    "quantum properties of two uncorrelated squeezed modes in terms of interference visibility are investigated . in section iv , hbt entanglement witnessing is analyzed for an unsqueezed epr mixed state .",
    "this witnessing operator becomes useful in the discussion of cv werner states . in section",
    "v we discuss entanglement generated by the action of a beam splitter on two squeezed states . for such general states the properties of the hbt interference",
    "are discussed . finally some conclusions are presented .",
    "we start our discussion with a brief review of a one - mode gss of the radiation field .",
    "as it is known @xcite , the most general expression describing the density operator of a gss characterized by creation and annihilation operators @xmath1 has the form of a gaussian operator .",
    "up to linear shifts , this operator can be written in the following normally ordered form @xmath2}:\\ , , \\label{eq : rho_sec2}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 , where the two parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are related to the following field correlations @xmath6 in order to represent a physical state @xmath7 these parameters have to satisfy the following inequality @xmath8 where the equality holds only if the density operator is a pure state @xmath9 .",
    "various phase - space distributions , like the wigner function or the diagonal @xmath0-representation of the density operator ( [ eq : rho_sec2 ] ) can be evaluated taking the fourier transform of the weyl characteristic function @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the displacement operator , @xmath12 is the density operator given by ( [ eq : rho_sec2 ] ) and @xmath13 is the covariance matrix of these gaussian states .",
    "in general , a positive gaussian operator is said to be @xmath0-representable if there exists its decomposition in a coherent projector basis  @xcite @xmath14 with a non - singular phase - space distribution function @xmath15 .",
    "the gss state given by ( [ eq : rho_sec2 ] ) is @xmath0-representable if and only if @xmath16 , and in this case we have @xmath17}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 .",
    "this gaussian distribution with @xmath19 , corresponds to a thermal state with a mean number of photons given by @xmath4 .",
    "a @xmath0-representable squeezed gaussian state can be called classical because its statistical properties can be simulated from the above classical gaussian distribution function of the field amplitude and phase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_sec2 ] we have depicted values of ( @xmath4 , @xmath20 ) for which the mixed gaussian state is classical ( @xmath0-representable ) or nonclassical ( is not @xmath0-representable ) .",
    "continuous - variable states of light can be described by their electric field amplitude and phase quadratures @xmath21 with the commutator @xmath22=i$ ] .",
    "the uncertainties of these two quadratures are given by the following relations @xmath23    from these uncertainty relations we see that a classical gss can reduce thermal fluctuations ( characterized by the mean number of photons @xmath4 ) , to the vacuum level .",
    "quantum gss can reduce the quantum fluctuations in one quadrature ( e.g. amplitude ) below the vacuum level at the expense of increased fluctuations in the conjugate variable ( phase ) @xmath24 such a reduction can not be described by a @xmath0-representable gss .    as it is well known , the nonclassical nature of gss can be revealed in a second - order degree of coherence , even though the photon statistics of the vacuum squeezed state is super - poissonian  @xcite .",
    "for a general mixed gss , the normalized second - order degree of coherence is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the border value between classical and nonclassical gss .",
    "states , for which @xmath27 , are quantum , so not @xmath0-representable .",
    "note that for a small mean number of photons ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 can be very large .",
    "the nonclassical properties of a gss , can be witnessed using the following quantum witness operator @xmath30 in this case @xmath31 is positive for @xmath0-representable gss , and negative for not @xmath0-representable gss .",
    "pure state is always quantum , because @xmath32    a gss with controllable parameters @xmath4 and @xmath20 has been recently generated in an optical parametric amplifier with a phase - insensitive amplifier of gain @xmath33 followed by a phase - sensitive amplifier of gains @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "in such a generator the incoming mode @xmath36 is transformed as follows @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the amplifier quantum noise boson operators . assuming that modes @xmath36 and @xmath38 are initially empty we obtain that the outgoing state is a gss with latexmath:[\\ ] ] @xmath164 for these visibilities the set of classical inequalities is valid @xmath165 similar inequalities were derived in sec .",
    "iii for classical gss .",
    "this correlation function has been experimentally demonstrated in @xcite on fig.[11 ] , and has been used as an experimental test for the quality of the epr state .",
    "the reduction of noise in the beam , below the vacuum level , was dependent on the value of the mutual phase differences between two squeezed beams , @xmath71 .    for input states from the borderline @xmath83 between quantum and classical states",
    "we have the visibilities , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , that are clearly classical .    in fig .",

    "let us suppose that two modes of correlated gaussian states investigated in the previous section are not squeezed equally and the two squeezing parameters are not related to the correlation parameter @xmath123 in any way . in such case we can have @xmath172 where @xmath173 , and @xmath20 and @xmath123 are real for simplicity .",
    "we assume the same mean number of photons @xmath4 in each mode .",
    "this state is separable if the following separability condition is obeyed @xmath174    in this case , the in- and out - of - phase terms are not the only terms that can contribute to the second - order interference .",
    "few more cosine terms appear due to the fact that the modes @xmath53 and @xmath54 are correlated and these correlations do not cancel when evaluating the expressions @xmath175 and @xmath176 ( [ eq : hbt_correlation_sec3 ] ) .    as a result",
    "we obtain the following second - order correlation function @xmath177 with three visibilities @xmath178    the terms modulated by the visibility @xmath179 are genuine to correlated squeezed states .",
    "the appearance of @xmath180 and @xmath181 in the cosine terms is due to the fact that these two beams are not squeezed equally . in this case",
    "they do not give any contribute to the visibilities because the absolute values of squeezing parameters are @xmath180- and @xmath181-independent .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:11_sec6 ] visibilities @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath182 are depicted for a state with a mean number of photons equal to @xmath87 , squeezing parameter @xmath183 and phases @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "the border value of @xmath123 between separable and entangled states is equal to @xmath186 .",
    "the values of @xmath168 greater than @xmath187 and @xmath169 less than @xmath188 correspond to entangled states . for @xmath182",
    "the monotonicity decides if the state is entangled .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new method for witnessing quantum squeezing and entanglement of one- and two - mode mixed gaussian states .",
    "this method relies on hbt interference and second - order intensity correlations . for single mode gss ,",
    "a quantum witness operator has been introduced in order to distinguish classical and quantum squeezed states .",

    "we have shown that for epr states this witness operator provides a good test of quantum separability .",
    "we have applied the hbt interference and the hbt witness operator to discuss quantum properties of entangled squeezed states generated by a beam splitter .",
