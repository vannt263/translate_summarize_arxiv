    "turbulence exhibits intense bursts of vorticity and strain that can be important for example in production of forceful vortices in atmospheric flows .",
    "an important interest in atmospheric fluid dynamics is concentrated around the impact of the coriolis force on turbulence that tends to the two - dimensionalization of the flow . in this paper",
    "we consider direct numerical simulations of decaying turbulence in a rotating frame of reference studying the effect of the coriolis force on turbulence",
    ". for high rotation rates the coriolis force is dominant in a wide range of scales and plays an important role balancing the convective nonlinearity and viscous forces  @xcite .",
    "we will show that the coriolis force not only suppresses the forward energy transfer to small scales , but also modifies the dynamics of turbulence measured in terms of the structure functions .",
    "these are explored in this paper via direct numerical simulations at various rotation rates .    the kolmogorov k41 description of turbulence @xcite results in scaling laws for structure functions of the velocity increments .",
    "the second order structure function is the best - known , characterized by the famous kolmogorov energy spectrum with a @xmath0 slope .",
    "the kolmogorov approach predicts a linear dependence of the scaling exponents on the order of the structure function  @xcite .",
    "however , in three - dimensional isotropic turbulence a so - called anomalous scaling of the structure functions is observed  @xcite .",
    "this is visible in a nonlinear dependence of the scaling exponents on the order of the structure function .",
    "this anomaly is associated with the effect of ` intermittency ' .",
    "one may expect that rotation , which induces a ` trend ' toward partial two - dimensionalization of the flow , will reduce intermittency and thereby also the anomalous scaling .",
    "recent experiments in a freely decaying rotating turbulence using piv show a strong increase of the exponents of the structure functions  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly pronounced for the second - order structure function . correspondingly , a reduced scaling anomaly was reported .",
    "the main aim of this work is to complement these experimental findings with numerical simulations , allowing a direct correlation between reduced scaling anomaly and rotational flow structures .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the computational setting for simulations of turbulence in a rotating frame of reference .",
    "then , we present results of direct numerical simulations , quantifying the suppression of the energy decay for growing rotation rates .",
    "afterwards , we quantify the intermittency via computation of the structure functions .",
    "the tendency to two - dimensionalize due to rotation is clearly expressed in a reduced presence of smaller scales in the flow and correspondingly increases scaling exponents . finally , concluding remarks are collected in the last section .",
    "the decay of turbulence with an additional coriolis force is investigated in a simple temporal setting using a parallelized , fully de - aliased pseudo - spectral method to simulate the flow in a computational box endowed with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the incompressible navier - stokes equations for velocity @xmath1 , pressure @xmath2 , and external force @xmath3 : @xmath4 are transformed into equations for the individual velocity fourier coefficients @xmath5 in the wave - vector space @xmath6 : @xmath7 in the above equation , pressure is removed using the incompressibility condition via the projection operator @xmath8 ; the nonlinear term @xmath9 is transformed @xmath10 to the fourier space , but solved in the pseudo - spectral representation ; rotation is included via the external force also represented in the fourier space as @xmath11 .",
    "details of the code that is used for the numerical simulations can be found in  @xcite .",
    "rotation involves inclusion of the coriolis and the centrifugal force . assuming constant rotation rates , the centrifugal force can be incorporated in the pressure term and the coriolis force reads @xmath12 . in our simulations",

    "the coriolis force is diagonalized through this transformation and introduced as an integrating factor along with the viscous term in the navier - stokes equations . for time - integration",
    "the fourth - order , four - stage , runge - kutta method is used . to remove the aliasing errors ,",
    "the nonlinear term is computed on two grids ( original and shifted ) with an additional truncation to @xmath32 active modes for the lower resolution ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 for the higher resolution ( @xmath35 ) runs at the cut - off number @xmath36 for the cubic box of length @xmath37 .",
    "diagonalization of the coriolis force through helical wave decomposition allows performing simulations at acceptable time - steps as the rotation does not dominate the reduction of the step in the explicit integration of the equations ( [ eq : hwd ] ) .",

    "in the first period up to about @xmath58 , the energy decay slope significantly varies in the first period of the decay .",
    "this is in particular visible for low rotation rates .",
    "such behavior can be understood from the fact that at low rotation rates the flow needs more time to adapt itself to the imposed rotation .",
