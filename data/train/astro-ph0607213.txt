    "the population of accretion - powered millisecond pulsars ( msps ) has grown rapidly over the last three years , with the discovery of six new examples to bring the total sample to seven .",
    "sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  remains the best - studied of the seven sources , mainly due to the fact that it exhibits the most frequent outbursts , every 2.5 years or so .",
    "the source was first discovered as a faint transient with _",
    "bepposax _  @xcite .",
    "orbital phase - connection across different outbursts has given the most precise determination of the orbital parameters @xcite ; the mass donor , which orbits the neutron star every 2.01  hours , is probably a brown dwarf heated by x - ray emission during quiescence @xcite .",
    "the review of @xcite includes details of the observations undertaken during each outburst .",
    "optical observations of the counterpart v4580  sgr @xcite have led to limits on the inclination of @xmath6 ( 90% confidence ) , assuming a distance of 2.5  kpc @xcite .",
    "the most recent outburst was in 2005 june @xcite .",
    "the neutron star has been detected in quiescence by _ bepposax _ @xcite and _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , and a _ chandra _ observation in outburst revealed the possible presence of a narrow o vii absorption line in addition to neutral absorption features attributable to the ism @xcite .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive study of the properties of thermonuclear ( type i ) x - ray bursts and the persistent x - ray emission from the accretion - powered msp sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 .",
    "we show that the sequence of x - ray bursts observed during the 2002 october outburst can be understood as a series of thermonuclear flashes driven by unstable helium burning in a layer of pure helium underlying a stable hydrogen burning shell .",
    "this regime of burning is predicted by x - ray burst models when the time between bursts is longer than @xmath7 day , sufficient for the hot cno cycle to exhaust the accreted hydrogen and leading to ignition in a pure helium environment @xcite .",
    "as far as we are aware , however , this regime has not been securely identified before .",
    "short duration ( @xmath8 ) x - ray bursts are observed from atoll sources at x - ray luminosities @xmath9 , and are often referred to as `` helium - rich '' because they do not show the long tails characteristic of hydrogen burning .",
    "however , these luminosities are several times larger than those where pure helium ignition bursts are expected , and in addition , the bursts are not well - described by the standard theory , for example having irregular recurrence times and energetics that indicate additional burning of fuel between bursts ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the aims of this study is to compare different methods used to constrain the distance to sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  and other msps .",
    "two principal methods have been used to date .",
    "first , three of the seven sources have shown thermonuclear x - ray bursts , which have a maximum peak flux believed to correspond to the eddington limit at the surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainty in distances determined by this method arises from uncertainty in the mean hydrogen fraction at the photosphere , and the neutron star mass .",
    "the distance to sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  was initally estimated at around 4  kpc based on the peak flux of a thermonuclear burst @xcite .",
    "the likely distance range was later revised to between 2.5 and 3.3  kpc ; the decrease from 4  kpc resulted from a more accurate analysis of an additional burst not detected in the original data , while the range arises from the possible variation of the eddington limit betweeen an h - rich and pure he atmosphere @xcite .",
    "second , the distance to a transient binary can be constrained by equating the time - averaged x - ray flux ( estimated from the outburst fluence divided by the time since the previous outburst ) and the flux predicted from the expected mass transfer rate due to gravitational radiation @xmath10 , which depends on the orbital period and the response of the mass donor to the loss of material ( the mass - radius relation ; see for example * ? ? ?",
    "because pulse timing gives the projected semimajor axis @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the inclination of the orbit ) , only a lower limit on the companion mass is possible , which gives a lower limit to the accretion rate and the distance .",
    "an important issue is the long term x - ray flux behavior of the msps .",
    "the mass transfer rates in many non - pulsing low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) vary on time scales comparable to msp outburst intervals , and it is possible that the same is true for the msps . presently this remains an open question because the msps have uniformly low accretion rates , and are transient , so that for most sources only one outburst has been observed .",

    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we present the observations and data analysis in  2 . in  [ distance ]",
    "we calculate the lower limits to the distance obtained by equating the long - term time - averaged x - ray flux with the predicted mass transfer rate driven by gravitational radiation , addressing the issue of long term variations in the measured time - averaged persistent flux for the five outbursts observed so far . in  [ bursters ] we compare the burst properties with theoretical ignition models . we first show that the burst energetics require a specific correlation between the hydrogen mass fraction @xmath3 and the mass fraction of cno elements @xmath4 in the accreted material .",
    "we then use this result to show that the measured recurrence times and @xmath21 values imply an accretion rate onto the star that is independent of @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and therefore gives a robust distance estimate .",
    "finally , in section  [ pre ] , we estimate the distance by equating the peak burst fluxes and the expected eddington fluxes reached during radius - expansion bursts .",
    "we conclude in  4 .",

    "we extracted pca standard-2 data over each observation ( excluding any bursts ) , separately for each pcu .",
    "we fitted absorbed blackbody plus powerlaw models in the energy range 2.525  kev , integrating the model to derive the persistent source flux @xmath26 . for selected ( preferably long ) observations we made absorbed comptonization ( `` comptt '' in xspec ) model fits to combined pca and hexte data , plus a gaussian describing fe k@xmath21 emission around 6.4  kev , where necessary .",
    "we then generated an idealised response with 200 logarithmically - spaced energy bins between 0.1200  kev and integrated the model flux over this range , using the ratio of the 0.1 - 200  kev to 2.525  kev flux as a correction @xmath27 in estimating the bolometric flux from each observation of each source . the x - ray colors for sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  were relatively constant throughout each outburst , and so we adopted a constant value of @xmath28 .",
    "we used measurements of the burst properties tabled in the catalog of galloway et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ; hereafter g06 ) .",
    "these include the start time ( measured as the time the burst flux first exceeds 25% of the maximum ) , bolometric fluence @xmath29 , and the ratio of the integrated persistent flux to the fluence @xmath21 .",
    "the latter parameter is subject to systematic errors due to intermediate bursts which may be missed during source occultations occuring every 90  min orbit .",
    "we compared the observed properties of the bursts with the ignition calculations of @xcite , to which we refer the reader for further details .",

    "for a given accretion rate @xmath35 ( parameterised as a fraction of the eddington accretion rate @xmath36 ) we calculated the temperature profile of the accumulating layer of hydrogen and helium , adjusting its thickness until the condition for a thermal runaway is met at the base .",
    "the temperature is mostly set by hydrogen burning via the hot cno cycle , and therefore the cno mass fraction @xmath4 , which we refer to as the metallicity .",
    "the model also includes a flux from the crust @xmath37 . to calculate the burst energy , we assume complete burning of the h / he fuel layer , and that the accreted material covers the whole surface of the star .",
    "the total energy is then @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the ignition column depth , and @xmath40 is the energy per gram from nuclear burning . we write @xmath41 mev per nucleon , where @xmath42 is the mass - weighted mean hydrogen fraction at ignition .",
    "this expression for @xmath40 assumes @xmath43% energy loss due to neutrinos during the rp process ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we estimated the fluence for each outburst of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  using public _",
    "rxte _ pca and asm measurements , shown in figure [ 1808outbursts ] .",
    "generally , the pca observations ( which provide the best measure of the source flux ) are triggered after the outburst has commenced , and often do not cover the entire outburst , unlike the asm measurements .",
    "for this reason we integrated the asm intensities over the parts of the outbursts not covered by the pca measurements , and determined a cross - calibration between the pca flux and the asm intensity , as follows . for each pca flux measurement",
    "we selected the closest 1-day average of the asm 210  kev intensities , and performed a linear fit .",
    "the fluences derived by this method , scaled to give the estimated bolometric values , are listed in table [ outbursts ] .",
    "we propagated the errors from the errors on individual asm / pca measurements .",
    "we note that these values are roughly consistent with prior estimates , e.g. for the 1998 april outburst @xcite estimated @xmath66 ( 3150  kev ) , whereas we estimate @xmath67 ( extrapolated 0.1200  kev ) .",
    "the derived fluences were constant to within the errors , with variation only at the @xmath68 level .",
    "however , the interval between outbursts increased after each of the the first three , from 1.58  yr between the 1996 september and 1998 april outbursts , to 2.8  yr between the 2000  january and 2002  october outbursts .",
    "although the interval to the 2005 june outburst was slightly less than the previous interval , the integrated fluence was the lowest of all the outbursts .",
    "as a result , the time - averaged x - ray flux dropped by 40% between 1996 and 2002 . since the derived distance limit depends on the mean flux only to the @xmath69 power ( equation [ bddist ] ) , the derived distance limits varied only by 30% , up to a maximum of 3.4  kpc ( table [ outbursts ] ) . the mean x - ray flux , based on the four outbursts observed since 1996 september , was @xmath70 , which ( for a distance of 3.6  kpc ) corresponds to approximately @xmath71 .",
    "we now compare the properties of thermonuclear bursts from sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  with predictions from theoretical ignition models .",
    "observed properties of the bursts are listed in table 2 .",
    "the bursts were quite homogeneous , with standard devation of the fluences of only about 12% .",
    "the bursts were all observed within a 100  hr interval just after the outburst peak , and the last three were separated by 21.1 and 29.8  hr , respectively . this increase in burst interval",
    "was observed as the 2.525  kev flux decreased from 2.3 to @xmath72 .",
    "gaps between the observations with bursts make it possible that intermediate events were missed .",
    "assuming that was not the case , the estimated @xmath21-values for the second two intervals were @xmath73 , @xmath56 respectively .",
    "these values , along with the fast rise times ( @xmath74  s ) suggest pure he fuel .",
    "this is supported by the lightcurves of the x - ray bursts , an example of which is shown in figure [ 1808bursts ] .",
    "the long @xmath75 second period of constant ( presumably eddington ) luminosity followed by a decay over @xmath75 seconds is remarkably similar to the results of @xcite for bursts which ignite helium in a pure helium environment ( compare with their fig .",
    "26 ) . as we will show",
    ", the recurrence times and energetics of the bursts also suggest that helium ignition is occurring in a pure helium layer beneath steady hydrogen burning shell .      before presenting our detailed fits to the ignition models",
    ", we first make some analytic arguments which help to understand the observed properties of the bursts and the results of our fits .",
    "first , consider the burst energetics . the observed values of @xmath76 imply that the nuclear energy release per gram is @xmath77 mev per nucleon , where we take the gravitational redshift @xmath78",
    ". using the relation @xmath79 mev per nucleon gives an average hydrogen mass fraction @xmath80 in the burning layer immediately prior to ignition .",
    "the low mean hydrogen fraction at ignition comes about because hot cno hydrogen burning leads to steady depletion of the hydrogen as the h / he layer accumulates .",
    "the time to burn all the hydrogen in a given fluid element depends on the initial hydrogen fraction @xmath3 and the mass fraction of cno elements @xmath4 . in the observer s frame , this time is @xmath81 .",
    "the bursts from sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  have recurrence times @xmath82 day and @xmath80 .",
    "this immediately constrains @xmath4 and @xmath3 : only particular combinations of these two parameters will lead to an average hydrogen mass fraction @xmath83 for the observed recurrence time of @xmath84 day .",
    "the average hydrogen fraction in the layer at ignition is @xmath85 , where we have used the fact that the hydrogen fraction decreases linearly with depth @xcite . setting @xmath86 and @xmath87 to the observed values , we find @xmath88 is the required relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 to reproduce the measured values of @xmath87 and @xmath86 is quite sensitive to the assumed redshift through the factor @xmath89 , since for a given @xmath21 , @xmath90 .",
    "for example , a larger choice for the redshift of @xmath91 , which gives @xmath92 , shifts the relation in equation [ eq : zxcorr ] so that it admits both solar values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , as we describe in  3.2.2 , our detailed fits , which account for the variations in burst properties from burst to burst , constrain the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be approximately that given by equation [ eq : zxcorr ] , or in other words imply that @xmath93 . the resulting constraints on mass and radius",
    "are described in  3.2.2 ( see discussion below eq .",
    "13 ) . ] .    to go further ,",
    "we need to understand the ignition column depth .",
    "an example of a temperature profile in the layer for @xmath94 is given in figure 1(b ) of cumming & bildsten ( 2000 ) .",
    "the temperature rises through the hydrogen burning layer as the hydrogen burns , but the layer of pure helium which accumulates beneath it is close to isothermal .",
    "therefore the temperature at the base of the hydrogen burning layer is a good approximation of the ignition temperature .",
    "the temperature profile in the hydrogen burning layer is given by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the opacity , and @xmath39 is the column depth ( units of @xmath97 ) . the flux is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the depletion depth for hydrogen .",
    "the energy release in the hot cno cycle is @xmath100 ; the heating rate from the hot cno cycle is @xmath101 .",
    "integrating from the surface , we find the temperature at the base of the hydrogen layer is given by has some dependence on composition via the opacity .",
    "however , this is a small effect . varying the hydrogen fraction or metallicity from zero to solar values , we find that the resulting changes in opacity are @xmath102% , and the changes in temperature ( eq .  [ eq : tb ] ) and inferred accretion rate ( eq .",
    "[ eq : acc ] ) smaller still because of the weak dependences @xmath103 and @xmath104 . ]",
    "@xmath105 but we have already seen that the energetics fix the ratio @xmath106 ( eq .  [ [ eq : zxcorr ] ] ) , and so the temperature @xmath107 is independent of @xmath3 or @xmath4 , @xmath108 where we set @xmath109 as a typical value for opacity and @xmath110 .",
    "next we assume that the helium layer is isothermal , so that @xmath107 is also the temperature at the helium ignition depth .",
    "it can be shown that this is a good assumption as long as the flux heating the helium layer from below is @xmath111 for @xmath86 of @xmath112 , which is satisfied for the expected values of @xmath113 mev per nucleon ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a good fit to the helium ignition curve of @xcite is @xmath114 ( for @xmath115 ) . substituting equation ( [ eq : tb ] ) for @xmath107 into this fit , and solving for @xmath116 gives @xmath117 where we again set @xmath109 .    to summarize",
    ", we have found that given a sequence of pure helium ignition bursts with measured @xmath87 and @xmath86 ( or equivalently @xmath87 and @xmath21 ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 must be related according to equation ( [ eq : zxcorr ] ) , and the accretion rate is determined by equation ( [ eq : acc ] ) independent of @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "writing @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the gravitational energy release per gram , and solving for the distance , we find @xmath120 which is independent of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we can improve on the estimates of the previous section by firstly fitting the observations to the full ignition models ( which , for example , include accurate opacity values as a function of depth in the layer ) , and also by fitting for the change of burst recurrence time with changing accretion rate during the outburst .",
    "we generated sequences of bursts based on the inferred @xmath35 history of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  during the 2002 outburst as follows .",
    "first , for a given set of model parameters ( @xmath37 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) we identified the values of @xmath35 for which the recurrence time was closest to that of the third and fourth bursts ( assuming no intermediate bursts occurred ) , @xmath121  hr and @xmath122  hr . from these @xmath123 , @xmath124 values we calculated the ratio of the persistent fluxes to the inferred @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the mean 2.525  kev persistent flux ( in units of @xmath127 , from cubic spline interpolation ) between burst @xmath128 and @xmath12 . the value of @xmath129 will obviously depend upon the distance to the source , as well as the neutron star mass and radius , but at this stage we assume no particular values for these parameters , only that the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath35 is constant over the interval where the bursts occurred .",
    "we converted the interpolated flux history of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  to an @xmath35 history by scaling by @xmath129 , and generated sequences of bursts forward in time from the first burst using the ignition model .",
    "we then matched simulated bursts predicted to occur at approximately the same time as the observed bursts , and compared their properties .",
    "specifically , we compared the model predicted variation of the fluence and @xmath21-values by calculating two additional ratios @xmath130 ( where @xmath131 is the predicted value from the model , and @xmath132 is the observed value ) , and @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 is the predicted burst luminosity in @xmath135 ) .",
    "we scaled @xmath136 and @xmath134 by the factors @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively , in order to compare with the observed values .",
    "effectively , we try to match the observed variation of @xmath29 and @xmath21 with @xmath35 , under the assumption that the average offset between the observed and predicted values is a function of the system parameters ( see  3.2.3 ) . in order to quantify the agreement with the observed values , we calculated an overall @xmath139 for the simulated burst properties , including predicted burst times for the second through fourth bursts ; @xmath140 where we adopted a representative uncertainty for the burst arrival times of @xmath141  min chosen so that the contribution of the last term in equation ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) was comparable to the other terms in the sum ( the burst start times are actually measured to a precision of less than a second ) .",
    "we carried out the simulation for a range of input parameters defined by grids of @xmath37 between 0.1750.5  mev / nucleon ( in steps of 0.025 ) , @xmath1420.034 ( steps of 0.002 ) and @xmath1430.74 ( steps of 0.02 ) , and calculated the @xmath139 for each grid point .",
    "the burst times were reproduced well over a range of the input parameters , with an error as small as just 0.2  hr rms .",
    "the variation in @xmath29 and @xmath21 was less well fitted , giving an overall @xmath144 . with three burst arrival times , three @xmath21 values and four measured fluences , and three parameters in the fit ( @xmath37 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 )",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is 6 , so that the best fit is not statistically acceptable .",
    "g06  estimated the errors on the fluence for the bursts by propagating the uncertainties in the measured flux in each time bin .",
    "however , during the 68  s pre episode in each burst the x - ray flux was between @xmath145 and @xmath146 , so that the onboard telemetry buffer was filled more rapidly than it could be read out ( once per second ; fig .",
    "[ 1808bursts ] ) . as a result",
    ", we have incomplete information about the flux at the peak of the bursts , which makes it likely that the uncertainty on the fluences ( @xmath147% on average ) was underestimated .",
    "the variation of the flux at the peak of the burst of @xmath148 , combined with the typical observational duty cycle there ( due to the gaps ) of @xmath149% suggests that the actual fluence uncertainty is around a factor of 2 higher . by increasing the error on the fluences by this factor , and propagating the uncertainties for the @xmath21 calculations",
    ", we obtained a @xmath139 value which was still significantly larger than the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "increasing the errors on the fluence by an additional factor of two was sufficient to achieve a minimum @xmath139 of 6.2 , comparable to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we compare the measured burst properties and the best set of model results graphically in fig .",
    "[ bestresult ] .",
    "we also estimated from the grid results the confidence region for each of the three parameters .",
    "the lowest values of @xmath139 were consistently achieved for @xmath150  mev / nucleon . in order to illustrate graphically the combined confidence region for the other two parameters",
    ", we flattened the grid along the @xmath37 axis to plot figure [ chigrid ] .",
    "we adopt as a confidence level the probability corresponding to a @xmath151 deviation , for which the customary confidence region has @xmath152 ( for two parameters of interest ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we found the best agreement of the measured burst properties to the ignition model within a diagonal strip in @xmath4-@xmath3 space .",
    "this correlation is in good agreement with equation ( [ eq : zxcorr ] ) which follows from consideration of the burst energetics .",
    "we could not obtain an acceptable model fit for @xmath153 . the best solution for solar @xmath154 required @xmath155 ; in contrast , for a solar @xmath156 , the corresponding @xmath4 was substantially above the solar value at 0.03 .",
    "as a consistency check we compared the predicted times of bursts which were not detected in the _ rxte _ observations , with the time intervals in which _ rxte _ was observing the source .",
    "we predicted two additional bursts on october 16 ( fig .",
    "[ bestresult ] ) , between the first two bursts detected by _ rxte _ ; none of the model runs which agreed well with the observations ( i.e. @xmath157 ) predicted times for these bursts which fell within the observations on that day .",

    "the set of models that agreed well with the observations predicted times for the seventh burst between mjd  52568.398 and 52568.601 ( october 21 ) ; just five predicted times fell within the time interval for one of the observations on that day , compared to 273 which fell within the gap .",
    "thus , we estimate the probability of having observed this burst as 0.018 , which is consistent with the lack of detection by _ rxte_.    the ignition models also allow us to estimate the mean h - fraction at ignition for each of the bursts . over the @xmath151 confidence region in @xmath4-@xmath3 space ,",

    ", we find @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "the decrease in @xmath42 is consistent with the steadily increasing burst recurrence time , which allows more of the accreted h to be removed by steady burning .",
    "based on our simulation results , we attempted to constrain the distance to sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 . the accretion rate ( per unit area ) is @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the distance to sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 , and @xmath165 is the energy released per nucleon during accretion .",
    "then @xmath166 most of the terms in equation [ r1 ] are expected to be of order unity .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath167  kpc as a rough estimate of the distance ; we found a range of 3.13.5  kpc over the set of model parameters @xmath37 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 for which the @xmath139 value was within the @xmath151 limit for 3 parameters ( @xmath168 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , we calculate @xmath169 so that we obtain a second estimate of the distance @xmath170  kpc based on the observed and predicted fluences . over the @xmath151 confidence range of ignition model parameter space",
    "we find a distance range of 3.63.8  kpc .",
    "that the ranges of @xmath171 and @xmath172 do not coincide indicates that at least one of the terms in equations [ r1 ] and [ r3 ] deviates significantly from 1 . because the @xmath173 term is the only one common to both expressions , and it appears in both distance expressions with exponents of the same sign , we infer that no single term can give rise to the disagreement",
    ".    the calculated values of @xmath137 can give an indication of which parameters may vary from our estimated values .",
    "we derive @xmath174 and we found over the @xmath175 confidence region @xmath176 varies between 1.56 and 1.79 .",
    "this suggests that the neutron - star mass must exceed @xmath65 , or that the radius must be @xmath177  km or that @xmath178 ( or some combination of the three ) .",
    "a larger @xmath179 would explain the lower value of @xmath129 ( equation [ r1 ] ) leading to the distance estimate @xmath180 ; similarly , @xmath178 would lead to an inflated value of @xmath172 . on the other hand , a smaller @xmath181  km would drive both @xmath171 and @xmath172 to even greater disagreement .",
    "thus , we conclude that the likely explanation for the disagreement between @xmath171 and @xmath172 is that @xmath182 and @xmath183 , and that the distance range is between 3.13.8  kpc .",
    "presently , the most commonly - used method to determine the distance to a bursting lxmb is to measure the peak flux of thermonuclear bursts which exhibit photospheric radius - expansion .",
    "such bursts exhibit a localized maximum in the fitted blackbody radius in the first few seconds of the burst , accompanied by a local minimum in the blackbody temperature .",
    "several authors have shown that the peak flux of radius - expansion bursts for sources with known distances is a rough standard candle ; e.g. @xcite found that a sample of radius - expansion bursts from globular cluster lmxbs almost all reached a common peak luminosity of @xmath184 .",
    "this empirical value is somewhat higher than predicted by theory @xcite @xmath185 } { \\sigma_{\\rm t}(1+x)[1+z(r ) ] }        \\nonumber \\\\    & = & 2.7\\times10^{38 } \\left(\\frac{m_{\\rm ns}}{1.4m_\\odot}\\right )   \\frac{1+(\\alpha_{\\rm t}t_{\\rm e})^{0.86}}{(1+x ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\      \\left[\\frac{1+z(r)}{1.31}\\right]^{-1 }   { { \\rm ergs\\,s^{-1}}}\\label{ledd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath186 is the effective temperature of the atmosphere , @xmath187 is a coefficient parametrizing the temperature dependence of the electron scattering opacity ( @xmath188  k@xmath189 ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath190 is the mass fraction of hydrogen in the atmosphere at ignition .",
    "the final factor in square brackets represents the gravitational redshift at the photosphere @xmath191 .",
    "the photosphere may be elevated significantly above the ns surface ( i.e. @xmath192 ) , in which case this is a small correction .",
    "all four bursts from sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  observed by _ rxte _ during",
    "the october 2002 outburst showed unambiguous indications of radius expansion ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these bursts all exhibited a local maximum in fitted blackbody radius and local minimum in blackbody temperature ( fig .",
    "[ 1808bursts ] ) immediately prior to the time at which maximum flux was reached .",
    "the average peak flux was @xmath193 , indicating a distance of @xmath194 ( 3.6 )  kpc for @xmath45 ( 0.0 ) in equation [ ledd ] ( see also g06 ) .",
    "these values are approximately the same as those derived by @xcite from the bursts observed first by _ bepposax _   during the 1996 september outburst . the corresponding distance assuming the empirical value of @xcite is 4.3  kpc .",
    "the best agreement with our distance estimate from  3.1 is for @xmath195 at the photosphere . without a detailed model of the expansion of the outer layers",
    ", it is not possible to say how the composition at the photosphere relates to the mean hydrogen fraction in the layer . nonetheless , we note that there is a rough anticorrelation between the peak flux of the burst and @xmath86 from our ignition model fits .",
    "this is shown in figure [ pflux ] .",
    "we have analysed the x - ray flux evolution during five outbursts of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 , as well as the sequence of thermonuclear ( type i ) x - ray bursts observed during the 2002 october outburst .",
    "the large @xmath21-values estimated for the bursts indicates low mean h - fraction @xmath2 at ignition , which analytically implies a common constraint on the accreted h - fraction @xmath3 and metallicity @xmath4 .",
    "we confirmed this result by comparing the measured burst properties and recurrence times with predictions by the burst ignition model of @xcite .",
    "we found that the inferred burst recurrence times were sufficiently long that the helium ignition occurs in a pure helium environment , the accreted hydrogen having completely burned away between bursts by the hot cno cycle . while the model comparison admits a range in both @xmath4 and @xmath3 , it excludes solar values for both .",
    "if the metallicity is approximately solar , then the hydrogen fraction in the accreted material @xmath3 must be significantly sub - solar ; on the other hand , if @xmath3 is approximately at the solar value , then @xmath4 must be significantly above the solar value .",
    "many stars in the galaxy have metallicities twice solar , and the progenitor of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  may have been a 23  @xmath196 star .",
    "the metallicities of other stars in the neighborhood may provide circumstantial evidence in support of super - solar values for sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 , although this would be far from conclusive .",
    "we used our fits to the burst models to constrain the distance to the source .",
    "our analytic estimates suggest that the local accretion rate onto the star , and therefore the distance , is determined independently of the accreted composition in this burst regime .",
    "our model fits support this , giving a distance range of @xmath197@xmath198 across the grid of the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath37 .",
    "we also used fact that the bursts showed photospheric radius expansion to constrain the distance , assuming that the peak burst flux was equal to the local eddington luminosity .",
    "this gives a distance of @xmath199 for a pure helium photosphere .",
    "finally , we obtained a constraint on the distance based on measurements of the fluence and recurrence time for each of the outbursts observed since 1996 september .",
    "the fluences were approximately constant between outbursts , but the increase in the interval between outbursts indicates that the long - term accretion rate is steadily increasing .",
    "we derived a lower limit on the distance based on the assumption that the long - term mass transfer rate is driven by gravitational radiation in the binary .",
    "since the long - term average flux is decreasing , this limit has increased with each successive outburst , to a maximum of 3.4  kpc for the interval prior to the 2005 june outburst .",
    "this limit excludes all but the largest values in the range derived from the peak burst flux . by combining this limit and",
    "the estimated range based on the peak burst flux , we derive a probable distance range of 3.43.6  kpc .    it is reassuring that the distance limits derived from the long - term flux history are consistent with our other measurements , despite the variations in @xmath35 .",
    "this is particularly relevant to the transient accretion - powered pulsars in which no bursts are observed . that the long - term averaged @xmath35 varies at all in sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  is unexpected , since the timescale for the variation is much shorter than the characteristic evolution time of these systems ( of order @xmath200  yr ) .",
    "the similarity of the lower distance limit derived from the long - term flux and the estimated upper limits from the bursts suggests that the mass - transfer rate has already reached @xmath201 , and thus could be expected to remain at least at that level for successive outbursts .",
    "alternatively , the observed variation may be part of a longer - term cycle , and @xmath35 may recover in the future .    as a caveat regarding the burst fitting procedure",
    ", we point out that we neglect possible systematic contributions , which are difficult to quantify .",
    "the most dramatic potential effect would be if we have missed every second burst in the regular earth occultations , so that the actual burst rate is twice what we infer .",
    "however , we can rule this out fairly confidently , since the required @xmath35 would be a factor of @xmath202 higher , in which case ( unless the persistent flux is preferentially beamed away from the line of sight ) the distance to the source would be around 40% greater .",
    "this would be significantly outside the probable range derived here or any range quoted in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite derived distance contours based on the measured @xmath203 of the optical counterpart , and estimated an inclination of @xmath204 for a distance of 3  kpc . for our estimated lower distance limit of 3.4  kpc , we infer @xmath205 , so that @xmath1 .",
    "our best - fitting models give a value @xmath206 mev per nucleon for the flux from deep in the star that heats the accumulating fuel layer .",
    "for an accretion rate @xmath207 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : acc ] ) , the corresponding luminosity is @xmath208 .",
    "this value is three orders of magnitude larger than the quiescent luminosity of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 . @xcite",
    "modeled the quiescent spectrum as a blackbody plus power law component , and obtained an upper limit to the blackbody flux of @xmath209 . for a distance of @xmath210 ,",
    "the implied x - ray luminosity is @xmath211 .",
    "for a spectral model which included a hydrogen atmosphere model rather than blackbody , the upper limit was a factor of two lower .",
    "this large discrepancy between the outwards flux deduced from x - ray burst properties and the flux measured in quiescence is similar to the case of ks  1731@xmath0260 . in that case",
    ", the observed quiescent luminosity is @xmath212 ( for an assumed distance of 8 kpc ; rutledge et al .",
    "however , ks  1731@xmath0260 showed a superburst during outburst , for which a luminosity 20 times greater , @xmath213 , is required in order to achieve unstable carbon ignition at the correct depth ( figure 20 of cumming et al .",
    "the meaning of these discrepancies is not yet clear , but may indicate some additional heating of the deep ocean that is not included in current models of accreting neutron stars .    our new distance estimate for sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 eases the constraints on neutron star interior models from the quiescent luminosity .",
    "@xcite noted that the low quiescent luminosity implies that the neutron star core is cold , presumably indicating a massive neutron star core with fast neutrino emission .",
    "yakovlev et al . (",
    "2004 ) further found that only models with hyperons in the core could explain the low luminosity .",
    "however , they assumed a distance of 2.5  kpc , whereas our new distance of @xmath214 kpc implies a luminosity two times greater than that assumed by yakovlev et al .",
    "this is enough to relax the constraints so that core models without hyperons are viable ( see figure 6 of yakovlev et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the method for comparing the observed and predicted burst properties may also be applicable to other bursters , although if the accretion rate exceeds a few percent @xmath215 it would be necessary to adopt a more detailed ignition model taking into account thermal inertia effects , like that of @xcite .",
    "we explicitly assume that the proportionality between the x - ray flux and the accretion rate does not change with time .",
    "this is likely true for the part of the 2002 october outburst of sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  covered by our simulations , given the monotonic relationship between the x - ray intensity and the characteristic quasi - periodic oscillation frequencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; but is not in general true for other lmxbs .",
    "it is also important to verify the assumptions , particularly complete fuel consumption ; such conditions are likely the case for very regular bursts such as those typically observed in gs  1826@xmath024 @xcite , but are almost certainly not the case generally .",
    "we note that the degeneracy for the acceptable solutions between @xmath3 and @xmath4 arises from the similarity between the h - fraction at ignition for the four bursts , which in turn results from the relatively narrow range of @xmath35 over which the bursts in sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  are observed .",
    "if burst observations over a wider range of @xmath35 are available , we may very well be able to break this degeneracy and measure the full set of compositional properties of the burst source .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first time that a sequence of bursts in the pure - he ignition regime has been confirmed . at first inspection ,",
    "the lightcurves of the bursts agree well with the time - dependent models of @xcite , it will be interesting in future work to compare the observed and theoretical lightcurves in more detail .",
