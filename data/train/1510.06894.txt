    "in this paper , which is a sequel to appendix b in , we shall consider the computation of the disc partition function for the superstring z= e^-  ,  = _ 0 + _ 1 + ... for the euclidean minimal surface of ending on @xmath1-wound circle at the boundary . here",
    "the expansion is in inverse powers of the string tension @xmath4 and we will be interested in first subleading ( 1-loop ) correction @xmath5 .",
    "the string partition function should be representing the expectation value @xmath6 of the circular wilson loop in @xmath1-fundamental @xmath7 representation in dual @xmath8 sym theory taken in the limit @xmath9 and then expanded in large  t hooft coupling @xmath10 for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the well - known exact expression for @xmath6 in the planar approximation gives & & w = 2 k i_1 ( k ) = e^-  ,  = _ 0 + _ 1 + ...  , + & & _ 0 = - k  , _ 1 = + 3 2 k + 3 2  . assuming that the planar @xmath1-fundamental circular wilson loop is indeed represented by the open string path integral in with the boundary condition that the disc - like world sheet ends on @xmath1-wound circle at the boundary the corresponding minimal surface in , e.g. , @xmath11 with the metric @xmath12 is described by = k  ,  z= k  ,   r= ^2 k  ,   z=  , where @xmath13 .",
    "then the induced metric is ds^2 = k^2 ^2 k ( d^2 + d ^2 ) = d ^2 + k^2 ^2 d ^2  , =  . for @xmath14",
    "this is the usual @xmath2 metric but for @xmath15 it has a conical singularity at @xmath16 with negative deficit @xmath17 , i.e. this is a cone of @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding classical action is proportional to the regularized @xmath2 volume .",
    "to recall , the euclidean @xmath18 space in poincare coordinates @xmath19 with boundary being a line @xmath20 is not equivalent to @xmath21 in angular coordinates @xmath22 with boundary @xmath23 ; in particular , their regularized volumes are different v__2 =   0  ,   v_ads_2 = 2 ( 1 - 1 )   - 2  . here",
    "we set the @xmath2 scale to 1 , @xmath24 is the length of the boundary of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a radial ir cutoff . as a result , the renormalized classical string action for ( [ 3 ] ) is @xmath27 which matches the value of @xmath28 in ( [ b3 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the prescription to use the regularized volume of @xmath2 is a required part of definition of string theory partition function in the context of ads / cft .",
    "the starting point to compute @xmath5 is the general form of the superstring one - loop correction @xcite _ 1= .",
    "[ b1 ] in the simplest cases of minimal surfaces with symmetric - space induced metric ( like @xmath2 spaces of straight line and circular loop ) it is natural to preserve this symmetry in the loop computation till very end , i.e. not to introduce radial cutoff directly on contributions of individual modes .",
    "then , as standard for determinants on a symmetric spaces they can be computed using heat kernel technique ( utilizing in an essential way the unbroken global symmetry ) and the final expression will be proportional to the space volume factor for which we should use its renormalized value in ( [ o ] ) .",
    "for example , in the straight line case the classical action and loop corrections will be proportional to the volume of @xmath29 with boundary @xmath20 which has zero renormalized value in ( [ o ] ) and should thus be assumed to vanish , in agreement with @xmath30 on the gauge theory side .",
    "such heat kernel based computation of ( [ b1 ] ) in the @xmath14 circular loop case gives ( using that the renormalized @xmath31 ) _ 1 ( 1 ) = ( 2 )  .",
    "the same expression was found in using a different ( gelfand - yaglom ) method to compute the determinants with the radial ir cutoff implemented explicitly on modes and all power divergences dropped in the final expression .",
    "the same method applied to the @xmath32 case led to the following generalization of ( [ 4 ] ) _ 1 kt ( k ) = ( 2 ) + ( 2 k + ) k - k !  .",
    "this expression does not match the gauge theory result @xmath33 in ( [ b3 ] ) .",
    "the third @xmath34 term in @xmath33 may be attributed to the presence of the string tension normalization factor for the three ( mobius - symmetry ) ghost zero modes on the disc @xcite , which was not included in ( [ b1 ] ) and thus should be absent in ( [ 4]),([b2 ] ) .",
    "the remaining difference may be coming from a numerical factor in normalization of the disc zero modes or from the ratio of the ghost and the two longitudinal mode determinants ( assumed to be equal to one in ( [ b1 ] ) ) once they are computed with proper boundary conditions ( cf . ) .",
    "below we shall ignore these open issues and aim at just deriving the analog of ( [ b2 ] ) in the heat kernel approach of .",
    "explicitly , we will find that _ 1 ( k ) = k ( 2 ) + ( k )  ,   ( 1 ) = 0  ,   + ( k ) = - _ 0^ dyy y here the terms with @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the contributions of the scalar factors under log in ( [ b1 ] ) and the term with @xmath37  the contribution of the spinor factor . for large @xmath1 the integral @xmath38 is well approximated by a straight line , @xmath39 .",
    "this result for @xmath5 with @xmath40 is thus different from ( [ b2 ] ) of and also different from the simple gauge - theory expression @xmath41 in ( [ b3 ] ) .    here we will not attempt to understand the difference with ( [ b2 ] ) , concentrating on developing technical tools required for derivation of ( [ 5 ] ) that may have other potential applications .",
    "the main issue is to find scalar and fermion heat kernels on the cone of in ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "let us mention also that another possible application of the above partition function is to computation of rnyi entropy on @xmath2 ( see ) .",

    "here we used the antiperiodicity of @xmath241 and @xmath245 .",
    "we can now change the periodicity of @xmath170 from @xmath192 to @xmath246 and to get the expression for the spinor heat kernel on the cone of @xmath179 k _",
    "( x(),x(0);t)&= & _ a_0 dz   k(x(z),x(0);t ) + & = & _ a_0^ dz   k(x(z+),x(0);t )  , where @xmath197 is again given by two lines in the upper and lower half plane : one running from @xmath199 to @xmath200 and the other from @xmath201 to @xmath202 .",
    "next , we deform @xmath197 into a small circle around @xmath90 and a contour @xmath203 made of two vertical lines that run from @xmath204 to @xmath205 and from @xmath206 to @xmath207 . setting @xmath247 we obtain @xmath248 this expression",
    "can be generalized to the case of a cone of curved 2d space where the heat kernel depends on the angular distance between two points @xmath61 and @xmath213 @xmath249 here , as in the scalar case in ( [ a7 ] ) , @xmath66 is modified by @xmath250 . defining the integrated kernel as in ( [ a88 ] )",
    "we then get the final expression for the traced spinor heat kernel : @xmath251 here @xmath252 is over the spinor indices and the integration contour reduces for @xmath253 to the two vertical lines going from @xmath224 to @xmath225 and from @xmath226 to @xmath70 . for @xmath84",
    "the integrand becomes periodic ( as the product of two antiperiodic functions in @xmath65 ) and thus the integral contribution vanishes .",
    "here we solve the equation ( [ 32 ] ) for the matrix @xmath51 in the @xmath2 metric ( [ aa ] ) written in polar coordinates .",
    "the corresponding zweibein and tangent space and spinor connections are ( @xmath254 ) & & e^1_=(1,0 )  ,  e^2_=(0 , )  ,    _ ^=0  ,    _ ^12=-_^21=-  , + & & _ = 1 2 _ ^ _ = ( 0,-  _ 3 )  ,    _ = 14 [ _ , _ ]  ,   ^= ( _ 1,_2 )  . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that ( [ 32 ] ) is equivalent to the requirement that the spinor covariant derivative acts on @xmath255 in the following way @xmath256 where the geodesic distance between the two points @xmath257 is given in ( [ aaa ] ) .",
    "this equation for @xmath51 can be rewritten as _",
    "_ 3u  , = ( - _ d ) _ 3 u  .",
    "the first equation in ( [ 35b ] ) has solution [ 36b ] & & u(,^,,^)= c(,^ )  , + & & b(,^,,^)=  _  . using ( [ aaa ] ) we find b&= &   + & = & 2 -  .",
    "the matrix @xmath258 can be determined from the second equation in ( [ 35b ] ) _ c= _ 3 ( - _ d-_b ) c = 0  , where we used ( [ aaa ] ) and ( [ 3888 ] ) .",
