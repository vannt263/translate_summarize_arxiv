    "_ at the fifteenth international conference on pattern recognition held in september 2000 , about 90 participants , most of them with some background in fingerprint analysis ( quoted from page 293 in @xcite ) were shown four fingerpint images ( reproduced in figure [ figsurvey ] ) .",
    "they were told that three images were acquired from real fingers and one of these prints was synthetically generated and they were asked to identify the artificial print .",
    "only 23% of the participants correctly chose the synthetic print ( image ( a ) in figure  [ figsurvey ] ) . _",
    "_ in this paper , we present a method that is able to perform the task at which the human experts failed : we introduce a test of realness which can separate real from synthetic fingerprint images with very high accuracy .",
    "we applied the method ( a detailed description follows in section [ histograms : scn ] and [ discrimination : scn ] ) to these four images and the proposed method distinctly identifies the correct image ( computing the difference of minutiae histogram distances explained in section [ emddiff ] yields a negative score for image ( a ) in figure [ figsurvey ] and positive scores for images ( b - d ) ) . _",
    "today , many commercial , governmental and forensic applications rely on fingerprint recognition for verifying or establishing the identity of a person . among these , methods building on minutiae matching play an eminent role . usually , matching routines are not only tested on real fingers , but in order to provide for theoretically unlimited sample sizes , synthetic fingerprint generation systems such as sfinge by cappelli _",

    "independently , methods have been developed to reconstruct fingerprints from minutiae templates ( cf .",
    "both methodologies are very relevant in many application areas :    * constructing synthetic fingerprint images facilitates the cheap creation of very large databases for testing and comparing the performance of algorithms in verification and identification scenarios . *",
    "ground truth data is provided for evaluating the performance of forensic experts @xcite as well as minutiae extraction algorithms . * matching performance of low - quality and latent fingerprints",
    "is improved  @xcite .",
    "* fingerprint reconstruction can be a building block for solving interoperability problems , e.g. on comparing fingerprints acquired from different sensors @xcite .",
    "* research in this area raises the awareness for aspects of security , privacy and data protection bearing in mind that an attacker may utilize existing techniques for creating a spoof and prepare a presentation attack . * mixing prints of two or more real fingers has been proposed for generating virtual identities , obscuring private information or creating cancelable templates @xcite .    of course , synthetic prints should be as real as possible pertaining to all properties and features which are relevant for fingerprint recognition , especially with respect to their minutiae distribution .",
    "otherwise , a human may be fooled by the look of a synthetic print ( see the motivational example given before the introduction taken from page 293 in @xcite ) , but their eligibility e.g. for evaluating fingerprint recognition algorithms may be challenged and results obtained on artificial databases would be insignificant .

    "this can be well conceived on the background that the issue of realistic minutiae distributions has only played a subordinate role in theoretical model building and practical research . in our contribution",
    "we provide for a simple method to assess minutiae distributions of single fingerprints as well as of samples of fingerprints .",
    "we demonstrate that after training , this allows to decide that minutiae patterns of synthetically generated fingerprints are not correct. in particular , we believe that including realistic minutiae distributions leads to a unified concept in which synthetic fingerprint generation and fingerprint reconstruction are in fact two sides of the same coin .",

    "this feature vector is not only highly potent to discriminate real fingerprints from fingerprints synthetically generated by the only publicly available current state of the art system , in a preliminary study we additionally demonstrate that this new feature vector is also highly discriminatory among real fingerprints as well .",

    "traditionally , the construction of artificial fingerprints is associated with an unknown outcome regarding the number , location , direction and type of minutiae , whereas reconstruction aims at the generation of a fingerprint image which has best possible similarity in terms of minutiae properties to a given template .",
    "basically , we propose to focus on the generation of a realistic minutiae template and `` all these other things above shall be added unto '' by the existing reconstruction methods . here is a possible outline of this approach :    * first , a feasible foreground and orientation field is constructed , e.g. using a global model like @xcite which is able to incorporate the empirical distribution of observed pattern types ( henry - galton classes ) and singular points @xcite . *",
    "secondly , a realistic number of minutiae @xmath2 is drawn from the empirical data of minutiae in fingerprints with the previously determined foreground size and pattern type .",

    "we compute the histogram intersection to better handle partial overlap @xcite .",
    "this approach is related to `` geometric hashing '' @xcite : a hash table is built by quantizing geometric objects like minutiae triplets which were used in @xcite .    in a first test on fvc2000 db2 , we achieved average access rates ( average part of the database that is accessed using an incremental search strategy until the corresponding finger is found ) between 2.33% and 4.01% using unnormalized 4d - mhs with 20 bins for differences between minutiae directions , 20 bins for euclidean distances between minutiae locations , 20 bins for the angle of the relative location of the second minutiae with respect to the first and 4 bins for minutiae type combinations .",
    "we chose this database , because it was used in tests measuring the indexing performance by other researchers : de boer _ et al .",

    "as we used , in contrast to these two studies , an `` off the shelf '' minutiae extractor ( ) , and as the performance hinges on correct minutiae extraction ( see figure [ figindex ] and the discussion below ) we deem our results very promising upon more `` correct '' minutiae extraction .    in our test , we used the sum of intersections between corresponding bins as a score ( bis = bin intersection score ) and sorted the list of fingers in the database in descending order . in 597 out of 770 searches ( 77 @xmath6 ) ,",
    "the correct finger was ranked first in the list . if the search is narrowed down to templates with 30 or more minutiae , than it ranked first in 393 out of 441 searches ( 89 @xmath6 ) .",
    "we inspected the cases in which a larger portion of the database were accessed .",
    "it turned out that the main reason lies in minutiae extraction errors ( missing and spurious minutiae ) which , of course , have a negative impact on the score : missing minutiae reduce the intersection between minutiae histograms of templates from the same finger , spurious minutiae can increase the intersection between histograms from templates of different fingers .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure [ figindex ] .",
    "another reason lies in almost no overlap areas between the two prints compared .",
    "we stress at this point that our bis has been designed to alleviate small overlaps .",

    "<S> in this study we show that by the current state - of - the - art synthetically generated fingerprints can easily be discriminated from real fingerprints . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a non - parametric distribution based method using second order extended minutiae histograms ( mhs ) which can distinguish between real and synthetic prints with very high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> mhs provide a fixed - length feature vector for a fingerprint which are invariant under rotation and translation . </S>",
    "<S> this test of realness can be applied to synthetic fingerprints produced by any method . in this work , tests are conducted on the 12 publicly available databases of fvc2000 , fvc2002 and fvc2004 which are well established benchmarks for evaluating the performance of fingerprint recognition algorithms ; 3  of these 12 databases consist of artificial fingerprints generated by the sfinge software . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we evaluate the discriminative performance on a database of synthetic fingerprints generated by the software of bicz versus real fingerprint images . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with suggestions for the improvement of synthetic fingerprint generation . </S>"
