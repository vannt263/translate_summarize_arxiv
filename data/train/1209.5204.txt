    "<S> the stability region of the @xmath0-oscillation is separated from that of mst state at a critical coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> also a significant change in the energy spectrum takes place above the critical coupling strength , and pairs of ( quasi)-degenerate excited states appear . </S>",
    "<S> the original model of bjj can be mapped on to a simple hamiltonian describing quantum particle in an effective potential with an effective planck constant . </S>",
    "<S> different dynamical states and degenerate excited states in the energy spectrum can be understood in this effective potential approach . also possible </S>",
    "<S> novel quantum phenomena like macroscopic quantum tunneling(mqt ) become evident from the simple picture of effective potential. we study decay of metastable @xmath0-oscillation by mqt through potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the doubly degenerate excited states in the energy spectrum are associated with the classically degenerate mst states with equal and opposite number imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the energy splitting between these quasi - degenerate excited states due to mqt of the condensate between classically degenerate mst states . </S>"
