    "with the recent all - sky data release of the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) , we are now able to retrieve near - infrared ( nir ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 magnitudes for more than a thousand white dwarfs that fall within the 2mass detection limit .",
    "this database was used in several studies aimed at identifying new cool white dwarfs or circumstellar disks @xcite and seeking binary candidates @xcite .",
    "in addition to the 2mass nir photometry , there is a developing interest to observe white dwarfs at longer wavelengths in the mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "irac photometry has been used in recent surveys of relatively bright , nearby white dwarfs to better constrain the atmospheric parameters of cool white dwarfs @xcite and to seek mir excesses from disks @xcite . before undertaking a more systematic search of white dwarf stars in binaries or of circumstellar disk systems using 2mass or _",
    "data , it seems appropriate as a first step to evaluate properly the reliability of the infrared photometric data sets .",
    "our photometric sample used to compare against the 2mass data is drawn from the detailed photometric and spectroscopic analyses of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter brl97 ) and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter blr01 ) who obtained improved atmospheric parameters of cool white dwarfs from a comparison of optical @xmath3 and infrared @xmath4 photometry with the predictions of model atmospheres appropriate for these stars .",
    "we selected from these studies 183 cool white dwarfs with infrared @xmath4 magnitudes measured on the cit photometric system .",
    "we searched the 2mass psc for all white dwarfs and we recovered the 2mass @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 magnitudes for 160 stars from our initial cit photometric sample of 183 objects .",
    "figure 1 shows the differences in magnitudes between the infrared cit and 2mass photometric systems for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath5 filters for the white dwarfs in our sample .",
    "note that the number of stars in each panel is different since some stars have not been formally detected in one or more bands in 2mass .",
    "the size of the error bars in figure 1 correspond to the combined quadratic uncertainties of both data sets , @xmath6 . for both measurements to be compatible , the error bar must touch the horizontal dashed line in each panel of figure 1 , which represents the mean magnitude difference between both data sets , as determined below .    ) , which correspond to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9.,height=434 ]    we present in table 1 a statistical comparison of both data sets for all three bands .",
    "the first three lines correspond to the full data set while the last three lines are restricted to 2mass magnitudes that satisfy the level  1 requirements .",
    "the second column indicates the number of stars used for the comparison .",
    "the third and fourth columns represent respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the magnitude differences for each band .",
    "these mean values thus correspond to the zero point offsets between both photometric systems .",
    "we note that the offsets are typically five times smaller than the average 2mass uncertainties ( fifth column of table 1 ) and these could as well be considered as zero for most practical purposes .",
    "if the uncertainties of both data sets have been properly evaluated , the average combined quadratic uncertainties , @xmath10 ( last column of table 1 ) , should be at least as large as the standard deviations of the magnitude differences .",
    "this is certainly the case for the level  1 subsample , a result that confirms the reliability of the 2mass level  1 photometry . for the complete sample ,",
    "however , the @xmath10 values are slightly below the standard deviations .",
    "if we assume that the cit photometric uncertainties have been properly estimated , which is supported in brl97 and blr01 by the successful fits with white dwarf models , the 2mass uncertainties might be slightly underestimated in the case of faint cool white dwarfs near the survey limit .",
    ".statistical comparison of cit and 2mass magnitudes [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "one of the most immediate applications to a large data set of white dwarf nir photometry such as 2mass is to seek infrared excesses due to cooler companions that are otherwise invisible in the optical .",
    "@xcite used a sample of 759 white dwarfs from the catalog of @xcite and identified as many as 95 binary candidates and 15 tentative binary candidates based on the analysis of a @xmath11 two - color diagram built from 2mass photometry .    in figure 2 , we compare 2mass and cit two - color diagrams for the 143 stars in our presumably single white dwarf sample of   2 that have been detected by 2mass in all three bandpasses .",
    "using the color criteria of wachter et al .",
    ", illustrated in the left panel of figure 2 , we find that several binary and tentative binary candidates in both regions defined by wachter et al .",
    "a comparison with the cit photometry , however , reveals that this result can be readily explained in terms of the larger uncertainties of the 2mass photometry since both regions are located @xmath12 away from the region occupied by single white dwarfs near the center of the figure .",
    "the large amount of contamination of the binary candidate regions suggests that their criteria are not stringent enough .",
    "@xcite used a similar two - color diagram approach with a sample of 51 magnetic white dwarfs as candidates for potential pre - cataclysmic variables .",
    "they proposed to split the @xmath11 two - color diagram into four regions , all illustrated on the right panel of figure 2 .",
    "while they did not find any binary candidates ( ii ) , they identified 10 objects with peculiar colors associated with very low mass companions or debris ( regions iii and iv ) .",
    "this represents a total of 28.6% of their sample with formal uncertainties with a possible companion or a disk . from our figure 2",
    ", we find that 21% of the white dwarfs from our 2mass sample of   2 would be considered possible candidates for a companion or a disk , while the cit data show little evidence for such infrared excesses .",
    "this strongly suggests that the sample of magnetic white dwarfs studied by wellhouse et al .  could be entirely consistent with single stars .",
    "to evaluate the reliability of the spitzer photometry , we use the observations of @xcite who have compared the _ spitzer _ 4.5 and @xmath13 m photometric data of 18 cool and bright white dwarfs with the predictions of model atmospheres .",
    "they found that the four hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs with @xmath14 lower than 6000  k show a slight flux depression at @xmath13 m , while one peculiar object , the so - called c@xmath15h star lhs  1126 , suffers from a significant flux deficit at both 4.5 and @xmath13 m .",
    "we selected 12 white dwarfs with _",
    "mir flux from @xcite which are also in our cool white dwarf sampleh star also show nir absorption explained by collision - induced opacity .",
    "this discrepency may indicate that the collision - induced opacity calculations need to be improved at the high densities encountered in cool white dwarf atmospheres .",
    "] of   2 .",
    "we determine the atmospheric parameters for each star by fitting simultaneously the average fluxes for the nine photometric bands ( @xmath3 , @xmath4/cit , and _",
    "spitzer _ 4.5 and @xmath13 m ) .",
    "in contrast with the technique used by kilic et al . , we do not normalize the fluxes at any particular band , but consider instead the solid angle @xmath16 a free parameter .",
    "furthermore , instead of assuming @xmath17@xmath18 for all objects , we constrain the @xmath17 value from the trigonometric parallax measurements . the synthetic fluxes in the mir are obtained by integrating our model grid over the _ spitzer _",
    "irac spectral response curves while the observed fluxes are taken directly from table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen- and helium - rich model atmospheres used in our analysis are similar to those described in blr01 and references therein , except that for the hydrogen - rich models we are now making use of the more recent collision - induced opacity calculations and the hummer - mihalas occupation probability formalism for all species in the plasma .",
    "we plot in figure 3 the ratio of the observed to model fluxes at 4.5 and @xmath13 m as a function of the derived effective temperature for the 12 objects .",
    "the the agreement between the observed _ spitzer _ and model fluxes is very good at all temperatures . in particular",
    ", we do not observe any significant flux deficit at low effective temperatures as suggested by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we argue that the results presented in this section demonstrate the reliability of both the _ spitzer _ irac photometry and our model atmosphere grid up to @xmath13 m for studying cool white dwarfs .",
    "in order to estimate the reliability of the 2mass photometry for white dwarf stars , we defined a sample of 160 cool degenerates with @xmath4 magnitudes on the cit photometric system taken from brl97 and blr01 , and compared these values with those obtained from the 2mass psc .",
    "our statistical analysis indicates that , on average , 2mass uncertainties are reliable but significant discrepancies are to be expected , especially for stars near the lower detection threshold .",
    "we also concluded that the search for white dwarf and main - sequence star binaries based on 2mass two - color diagrams is greatly limited by the 2mass uncertainties .",
    "we have also shown that the observed mir photometry from the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "agree very well with our model fluxes .",
