    "one of the most interesting results of observational cosmology over the last two decades has been the discovery of large scale structures and voids in matter distribution .",
    "+ to date , however , a clear definition of an homogeneity scale in matter distribution is still lacking",
    ". moreover , this controversy concerns the morphological features of the galaxy clustering , which has been found by several authors to have fractal characteristics at least up to a certain scale ( sylos labini , montuori & pietronero 1998 ; wu et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this case , a suitable cosmological model is lacking , given that the cosmological principle can not be applied .",
    "+ many authors have attempted to develop alternative models , following two different approaches .",
    "the first relies on a perturbative scheme , through the superposition of a fractal density perturbation to the frw background , both in newtonian gravity ( joyce et al . 2000 ) and in general relativity ( e.g. mittal & lohiya 2001 ) . the second concerns a more general relativistic study of the metric , used to match a fractal number counts relation , and extensive analytical ( e.g. humphreys et al . 1998 ) and numerical ( ribeiro 1992 ) computations have been performed .",
    "+ in any case , for both approaches , only lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) inhomogeneous metric has been considered , i.e. spherically symmetric solutions to einstein field equations .",
    "+ even if this is certainly a very interesting study , it is not the most suitable tool to study a fractal distribution . + as a matter of fact , in a fractal set of points the number density decreases on average from any point of the set . in a spherically symmetric distribution around a point",
    ", this is true only if you measure the density centering on that point .",
    "+ in this paper , the above restriction is relaxed and an inhomogeneous metric with no intrinsic symmetries is presented . + the starting metric is recovered from the class of stephani solutions ( stephani 1967 ) . specifically , the aim of this work is to extend the analytical characterization of a fractal matter distribution to a stephani universe , whose geometrical ( e.g krasinski 1983 ) and thermodynamical ( e.g. quevedo & sussmann 1995 ) description has already been widely discussed and will not be pursued here .",
    "+ in section 2 the general properties of the stephani model are recalled while the consequences on the redshift expression and expansion are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we derive the fractal constraints on the metric functions and the main results are discussed in section 5 .",
    "+ throughout the paper we have assumed natural units ( @xmath0 ) and the metric signature ( + , -,-,- ) .",
    "the greek indices refer to the whole components , while the latin letters are just for the spatial part .",
    "the metric of the stephani universe can be written as follows ( krasinski 1997 ) : @xmath1 where : @xmath2}^{2}+{[y-{y}_{0}(t)]}^{2 } + { [ z-{z}_{0}(t)]}^{2}\\}\\ ] ] @xmath3 @xmath4{r}^{2}(t)\\ ] ] @xmath5 are arbitrary functions of time and dots denote time derivative .",
    "+ eq.(4 ) is equivalent to the friedmann equation , although it must be stressed that the analogy is only formal and dictated by the same derivation ( through einstein field equations ) , but the function @xmath6 is not the equivalent of the scale factor @xmath7 in frw models . + as can be seen from eq.(1 ) and more precisely from the expression for v in eq.(2 ) , the model is inhomogeneous and has no intrinsic symmetries , unless @xmath8 are strictly constant . in this case",
    "@xmath8 become the center of spherical symmetry , even if the metric is still not homogeneous .",
    "+ moreover , the distinction between open and closed universe is more subtle than in frw ; indeed @xmath9 is a function of time and so it is not fixed as in frw model .",
    "however , it is worth remembering that fixing @xmath9 is not a general requirement of einstein s theory of gravitation .",
    "+ let us consider a perfect fluid ; the stress - energy tensor is : @xmath10 the stephani metric ( eq.(1 ) ) fulfills einstein field equations if the matter fluid has no shear ( @xmath11 ) , no rotation ( @xmath12 ) and mass is flowing along t - coordinate lines with : @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "@xmath17 is the @xmath18 , the notation @xmath19 means the spatial derivative and @xmath20 the covariant derivative . in the frw model , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the _",
    "hubble constant_. + it is important to note that in the model the matter does not flow along geodesics , as follows from eq.(7 ) ; this is a significant difference with frw model ( which have @xmath23 ) ( krasinski 1983 ) .",
    "+ turning to thermodynamics properties , einstein field equations with a perfect fluid source , the conservation law ( @xmath24 ) and the contracted bianchi identities coupled to the matter conservation equation ( @xmath25 ) can be reconciled in an equation of state , if the thermodynamical quantities are defined as follows : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 satisfying the gibbs - duhem equation ( quevedo & sussman 1995 ) : @xmath30 .\\ ] ] as underlined by other authors ( krasinski , quevedo & sussman 1997 ) , the physical meaning of the equation of state restricts the freedom in choosing the metric functions , though a defined correspondence among their properties and the physical quantities can not be set , in general . however , since this work is mainly focused on a fractal model characterization , we will assume that the thermodynamic scheme holds and the metric constraints will be derived independently .",
    "+ again , a deep difference with respect to frw models emerges , namely the equation of state is not barotropic , as it is evident from eq.(9 ) and eq.(10 ) .",
    "+ the fact that the equation of state depends on position , as indicated by eq.(9)-(12 ) , and the absence of any intrinsic symmetry make the model particularly suited in the description of a fractal distribution of matter .",
    "by definition , the redshift @xmath31 is determined along a photon path ( written in terms of the affine parameter @xmath32 ) as follows ( ellis et al . 1985 ) :",
    "@xmath33 on the other hand , the definition of redshift refers to the ratio of the time shift along observer s world line with respect to the shift along a general world line , namely : @xmath34 a more formal manner to find the aforementioned relation is given by considering the photon wave vector @xmath35 , which satisfies : @xmath36 @xmath37 therefore , with no loss of generality , normalizing with respect to the observer s value , it yields : @xmath38 it is worth noting that the above _ redshift equation _ is dependent from the position , which is another important difference with respect to frw models .",
    "+ in addition , other authors ( ribeiro 1992 ) have noted that more information about photon motion can be gained by evaluating the lagrangian of the metric in eq.(1 ) and then solving for the euler - lagrange equations : @xmath39 inserting the past light cone expression relating the derivatives of the time and spatial parts of the metric ( as follows by setting @xmath40 ) into the euler - lagrange equation for the time component , a few algebra leads to the time motion of photons : @xmath41 { \\left ( \\frac{dt}{d\\lambda}\\right ) } ^{2}=0.\\ ] ] in the motion of a photon the affine parameter @xmath32 is equivalent to the proper time @xmath42 , so that , from eq.(15 ) and eq.(18 ) , eq.(20 ) gives the _ redshift constraint _ on the metric : @xmath43 or equivalently : @xmath44 comparing the @xmath45 dependence in the redshift equation ( eq.18 ) with the expansion expression in eq.(8 ) and including the redshift constraint ( eq.(21 ) ) , yields : @xmath46 the left - hand side of the above equation is the equivalent of the hubble parameter in the frw models ( @xmath47 ) . in this case , the corresponding relation is : @xmath48 where @xmath7 is the scale factor .",
    "+ though a close correspondence between the two expression is apparent , they are quite different . in the case of an inhomogeneous model , the expansion",
    "is linked to the matter distribution since @xmath49 ( eq.(18 ) ) depends on the position via the function @xmath50 .",
    "+ in other words , different regions of the universe can undergo different expansion histories .",
    "+ this is evident from the expansion law , which appears to contain an additional term .",
    "indeed , the general redshift - distance relation is ( ehlers 1993 ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the unit vector joining the observer and the emitting source , whose distance is @xmath53 , and directed towards the source .",
    "the position vector @xmath54 is defined in the following way .",
    "let @xmath55 be the tensor projecting the tangent vector - space at each point perpendicularly onto the three dimensional subspace orthogonal to @xmath56 , namely : @xmath57 considering a displacement @xmath58 , we can define the position vector as : @xmath59 and then : @xmath60 the shear contribution vanishes in the present model , therefore , by using the _ redshift constraint _ and introducing the acceleration in terms of the metric functions ( eq.(7 ) ) , eq.(25 ) can be written as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the kinematic acceleration evaluated at the position fixed by @xmath53 .",
    "+ the first term is the analogous to frw hubble term ( albeit it depends on the position ) , since @xmath63 and @xmath53 is the comoving line element ( see next section , eq.(40 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the additional second term is a new dipolar one , that is purely cosmological , i.e. not due to peculiar velocities .",
    "+ a few consequences of this will be further analyzed in the last section , nevertheless , it is worth noting that the present model is suitable to describe a fractal distribution , since all the cosmological parameters depend on the position .",
    "+ using eq.(18 ) and eq.(29 ) , the metric function @xmath64 must satisfy the following differential equation : @xmath65 and its solution can provide the space - time expression for the redshift .",
    "+ eq.(30 ) basically describes a nonlinear wave motion with a damping factor .",
    "for instance , if the one dimensional equivalent is considered , eq.(30 ) has the general shape of the so - called _",
    "burger s equation _ , which is an approximate description of one dimensional turbulence , with a damping term .",
    "the density of sources along the @xmath53 direction after an affine parameter displacement ( @xmath66 ) at some point @xmath67 is ( ribeiro 1992 ) : @xmath68}_{p } d\\lambda\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the observer area distance ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath71 is the density of radiating sources in a subtended angle @xmath72 . + the density of sources can be found through the proper luminous matter density , assuming that the basic structures are galaxies with nearly the same mass @xmath73 : @xmath74 using eq.(31 ) and eq.(32 ) , a comoving observer measures a number of sources corresponding to : @xmath75 where integration is performed over the time @xmath76 spent by the photon along its path ; on the other hand , as a more physical interpretation , it directly links the motion of the photon to the intervening matter distribution , as the expression in eq.(9 ) for @xmath77 shows .",
    "+ this value can be matched to the expected fractal value in the following way .",
    "+ averaging over a sphere centered at the observer location , a volume and a volume density can be defined : @xmath78 @xmath79 where this time the luminosity distance @xmath80 corresponding to @xmath69 was introduced , since it is the observational distance measure .",
    "it can be related to the observer area distance by means of the redshift factor @xmath49 through the following : @xmath81 a fractal distribution of matter is characterized by a power - law scaling : @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a transition scale corresponding to homogeneity and @xmath85 is the fractal dimension .",
    "+ from the above equations and using the measured number counts , it yields : @xmath86 which links the unknown metric functions with observable quantities @xmath87 and is the _ fractal constraint _ on the metric .",
    "according to eq.(9 ) , the metric function @xmath88 is related to density evolution @xmath89 , so that the physical meaning of the fractal constraint is to relate redshift and matter distribution in the proper way over each @xmath90 hypersurface at each position .",
    "+ evaluation of the metric terms at the homogeneity scale ( @xmath91 ) simplifies the above relations and involves the knowledge of the fractal parameters ( @xmath92 ) , the number of galaxies @xmath93 and the typical galactic mass ( @xmath73 ) , which are provided by the analysis of the galaxy catalogues , and the redshift factor , whose expression can be inserted from the solution of eq.(30 ) .",
    "+ otherwise , the value of @xmath69 must be obtained using the proper - distance aperture of the subtended area , which follows from the line element for the metric in eq.(1 ) .",
    "the line element along the @xmath94-th axis at a fixed timed @xmath95 is therefore : @xmath96 and can be found as ( krasinski 1983 ) : @xmath97}^{-1/2 } \\arctan\\left ( \\frac{1}{2}{[{k}({t}_{0})]}^{1/2 } \\delta { x}^{i}_{0}\\right)&~~k({t}_{0 } ) > 0\\\\",
    "r({t}_{0})\\delta { x}^{i}_{0}&~~k({t}_{0})=0\\\\ \\frac{r({t}_{0})}{{[\\mid k({t}_{0})}\\mid ] ^{1/2}}\\ln   \\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}{[\\mid k({t}_{0})}\\mid ] ^{1/2}\\delta { x}^{i}_{0 } } { 1-\\frac{1}{2}{[\\mid k({t}_{0})}\\mid ] ^{1/2}\\delta { x}^{i}_{0}}&~~ k({t}_{0 } ) < 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , the value of @xmath93 can be obtained by setting the matching condition to a frw metric as @xmath84 is approached ( humphreys et al .",
    "1998 ) , i.e. by equating the expression for @xmath98 evaluated at @xmath84 with the frw analogous expression at the corresponding radial comoving homogeneity scale @xmath99 ( coles & lucchin 1995 ) : @xmath100a[t(r)]{r}^{2}}{{(1-{k}_{frw}{r}^{2})}^{3}}dr}\\ ] ] in terms of the frw scale factor @xmath7 and curvature constant @xmath101 . the above relation can be expanded and restated using the number counts continuity ( @xmath102 ) , if the number of particles in the lapse time @xmath103 is kept fixed ( i.e. no particle creation / destruction and evolution ) , as follows ( coles & lucchin 1995 ) : @xmath104 the condition : @xmath105 provides : @xmath106 it should be emphasized that eq.(46 ) and eq.(47 ) allow a comparison between the basic frw parameters ( @xmath107 ) and the ones involved in the present model , as they should represent the large scale structure in an equivalent way at the homogeneity scale .",
    "+ although the _ fractal constraints _ provides a link among metric functions , it is more appealing to infer an analogous expression depending on the luminosity distance , being it the proper observational distance measure .",
    "+ in this case , the same route can be followed , but an important modification at the very beginning must be set . as discussed by other authors ( celerier & thieberger 2001 ) ,",
    "if the observer area @xmath108 expressed in terms of the angular distance @xmath109 and the area @xmath110 resulting from the luminosity distance @xmath80 are matched , then , using eq.(36 ) , it yields : @xmath111 again , considering eq.(36 ) and the solid angles @xmath112 , @xmath113 respectively corresponding to @xmath108 , @xmath110 , by differentiating the above equation , an _ aberration _",
    "effect on the solid angle is found : @xmath114 \\equiv \\omega ( { d}_{a})~ a\\left ( \\frac{\\theta}{3},z\\right)\\ ] ] and the _ aberration function _",
    "@xmath115 introduced , as can be seen , describes the effect of the expansion on the subtended angle , i.e. the integration of expansion in proper time provides the aberration of the solid angle .",
    "+ using such a condition , the number counts in eq.(33 ) can be expressed in terms of the luminosity distance . in general , the latter is not a well defined quantity when referring to cross sectional area perpendicular to light rays ( @xmath116 in eq.(31 ) .",
    "the actual value of @xmath117 can be obtained by inserting eq.(36 ) and eq.(49 ) in eq.(31 ) , then : @xmath118 by defining : @xmath119 we get the new _ fractal constraint _ : @xmath120 which indeed is now dependent on luminosity distance , redshift and expansion , namely the observational quantities .",
    "the motivation for this work has been to describe a cosmological inhomogeneous model , which could represent a fractal distribution . since spherical symmetry does not completely describe a fractal distribution , we have considered stephani models , i.e. inhomogeneous models with no intrinsic symmetries .",
    "+ our results are the following .",
    "+ first , the redshift expression depends on the position ; of course , this character is present in any related cosmological parameter , such as the expansion and the @xmath121 value .",
    "+ in the frw , expansion is given by the hubble parameter , which is the only term governing the hubble law .",
    "on the converse , in the present model , the hubble law has an additional dipole term due to acceleration , which vanishes in the standard homogeneous cosmology ( the quadrupole term due to shear vanishes as in frw ) .",
    "usually , the observed dipole term is ascribed to peculiar velocities ; in the present model would add a pure cosmological contribution to it .",
    "+ the existence of a kinematic acceleration in inhomogeneous models has been invoked by other authors ( pascual - sanchez 2000 ) as the origin of accelerated expansion of the universe , as found by recent snae ia data ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ; riess et al .",
    "this could be considered as a viable alternative to the proposed interpretation within frw scheme , namely a positive cosmological constant or vacuum energy or quintessence .",
    "+ therefore , the striking implication of the coupling of space and time dependences in redshift is that different regions of the universe could undergo different expansion histories .",
    "+ actually , it should be stressed that the present model would lead to a deeply new interpretation of observations and many cosmological and astrophysical contexts should be reconsidered . +",
    "a second result is that we have explicitly introduced a fractal characterization of the model .",
    "+ the density depends on the redshift , which depends on the position .",
    "in addition , it fulfills the scaling law imposed by the fractal distribution .",
    "then , the density changes according to the fractal spatial scaling law and the redshift . this approach allows to map the density evolution on @xmath90 hypersurfaces , applying the fractal constraint . + the homogeneity scale @xmath84 plays an important role in the model.we recall that it is the scale at which the stephani model should match the frw one , i.e. the scale at which homogeneity and isotropy of the universe are recovered .",
    "the greatest information supply should come by estimating the parameters at that threshold length and imposing the frw / fractal matching condition .",
    "+ summarizing the whole set of constraints , the present model can explicitly express @xmath64 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 from functions in the metric .",
    "+ the key information still missing concerns probably the most extreme assumption of the model @xmath9 , i.e. curvature time evolution , that is no more kept fixed and bound to -1 , 0 , + 1 values as in frw universe .",
    "once @xmath9 is specified , @xmath124 and @xmath50 can be fully determined and a self - consistent cosmology can be built .",
    "+ so far , we have listed the main differences between the frw model and the one proposed here",
    ". however , an important point against inhomogeneous models is their incompatibility with high degree of isotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "indeed , it was demonstrated that an isotropic thermal radiation in an expanding universe implies a frw cosmology ( _ egs theorem _ , ehlers , green & sachs 1968 ) .",
    "the point is that the _ egs theorem _ was demonstrated for geodetic and non - accelerating observers , which is not the case in stephani models .",
    "if acceleration is not vanishing , an inhomogeneous cosmology allows a thermal radiation with high degree of isotropy as observed ( ferrando , morales & portilla 1992 ) and specific stephani solutions can be built without any violation to the cmb restriction ( clarkson & barret 1999 ) .",
    "+ nevertheless , it is to stress that limitations to the degree of inhomogeneity of the model must be compatible with , for instance , cmb isotropy and hubble law local trend ; for such a purpose , the derived _ redshift _ and _ fractal constraints _ must be tuned .",
    "+ actually , a more subtle and rather philosophical argument comes into play when facing with any inhomogeneous cosmology , that is the reliability and interpretation of the cosmological principle .",
    "+ moreover , the present model poses serious questions about the copernican principle , as well , which states that all observers are equivalent in the universe .",
    "this is the basis , for instance , of the _ egs theorem _ and is far from being straightforwardly fit by a fractal structure .",
    "+ a last comment concerns the observations , most of which can be reproduced by frw cosmology . as a conservative statement , it could be noted that each stephani solution includes frw as a limiting case , so that observations can not in general rule them out .",
    "the motivation for keeping frw as a description of the universe is actually that they are the easiest theoretical model .",
    "this led to prefer any modification to come from outside the cosmological framework ( e.g. inflation , dark matter ) and not in the cosmology itself .",
    "therefore , the theoretical choice has been overwhelming any observational basis , whose actual interpretation is not _ a priori _ excluded and could be reanalyzed within the class of inhomogeneous models .",
