    "we find that in all cases , other than tm - excitation on the patterned contact , the absorption in the exposed slg is similar to that of a slg on top of sio@xmath4 in the absence of the contact ( green dotted line ) .",
    "interestingly , there is some absorption in the covered slg as well . in the tm - excitation of the patterned contact we obtain a similar modulation with wavelength as that in the exposed slg , albeit of significantly smaller magnitude .",
    "we note that , in order to directly compare with the exposed slg absorption , we still normalize to the power illuminating the exposed slg area .",

    "we also obtain absorption in the other cases as well , peaked at@xmath0500 nm . this , however , is irrelevant to the grating and spps , as it is there that au becomes most transparent .",
    "au is strongly absorptive at high energies because of the onset of interband transitions from its d - electrons@xcite while it is strongly reflective at small energies because of its conduction electrons@xcite .",
    "the inset in fig.[fig : theorys3]d plots the reflection , transmission and absorption coefficients through a 50 nm thick au film in air , displaying au s transparency window at@xmath0500 nm .",
    "we explore the case of focused illumination on the grating , which more closely resembles the experiments . to better facilitate the simulation and avoid having laterally scattered light re - enter the computational cell",
    ", we remove the lateral periodic boundary conditions and adopt pml boundary conditions@xcite , so that any light scattered towards the sides of the computational cell permanently exits the calculations .",
    "we also consider a much larger exposed slg area for better visualization .",
    "we adopt a tm polarized 1@xmath48m - wide plane source illuminating the 13-period @xmath21=410 nm grating at a non - symmetric position , as depicted in fig.[fig : theorys4 ] .",
    "the frequency domain electric - field intensity profiles for @xmath103=500 , 600 and 700 nm are shown in logarithmic scale in fig.[fig : theorys4]a . no scattering occurs at 500 nm , while the most intense is seen at 700 nm .",
    "the system s full response is shown in fig.[fig : theorys4]b , where we plot the slg absorption throughout the length of the structure ( vertical axis ) for different wavelengths ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the illumination source is again a tm - polarized 1@xmath48 m wide spot as shown in the inset schematic .",
    "absorption is normalized to the peak incoming flux per unit area .",
    "three distinct regions emerge : up to 550 nm , absorption only occurs in the covered slg directly underneath the illumination source . for 550nm@xmath104650 nm , increased absorption is found in an extended area ( several microns away from the illumination spot ) in the covered slg , pointing towards light diffraction into spps in the au - sio@xmath4 interface . above 650 nm there is strong absorption in the exposed slg beyond the grating .",
    "this points towards light diffraction into spps in the au - air interface , which propagates and reaches the exposed slg at the grating s edge . in fig.[fig : theorys4]c we plot the same absorption map for te illumination of a patterned contact , while in fig.[fig : theorys4]d for illumination of an un - patterned contact . in both these cases",
    "no absorption is found , except directly underneath the illumination spot .",
    "it is thus clear that spp - mediated effects are dominating the response for tm - polarized illumination .",
    "the sio@xmath4 ( 300nm)/si substrate has two effects .",
    "first , it provides some interference - based enhancement in the slg absorption@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : theorys5]a plots the exposed slg absorption for the system described in fig.1 on top of a 300 nm sio@xmath4/si substrate .",
    "the response is similar to the semi - infinite sio@xmath4 case , except for an overall modulation due to the interference effects in the sio@xmath4 dielectric spacer . the net interference - enhancement ( i - e ) effect on absorption ( i.e. without the patterned contact ) is plotted in fig.[fig : theorys5]b .",
    "the dielectric spacer can thus be used as an additional degree of freedom ( i.e. the spacer s index and thickness ) in optimizing the system s response .",
    "we also simulated the asymmetric contact layouts studied in fig.1d on top of 300 nm sio@xmath4/si and found that they produce a very similar response irrespective of the finite dielectric spacer .",
    "this is expected , since i - e partially cancels out when considering asymmetric absorption .",
    "the second effect of the 300 nm sio@xmath4/si substrate is that the leaked spp of the au - air interface will be reflected back from the si substrate .",
    "fig.[fig : theorys6 ] plots the field intensities along the two au interfaces as well as the corresponding fourier transform amplitudes ( see fig.3b - e for the 300 nm sio@xmath4/si case ) .",
    "we note a deeper `` beat '' modulation of the fields on the au - sio@xmath4 interface , due to the back reflected fields of the `` leaked '' au - air spp .",
    "this is also apparent in the fourier amplitude .",
    "however , no frequency shifts are observed in the latter .",
    "we thus conclude that , other than some small amplitude modulations , the spp structure is largely unaffected by the sio@xmath4 being 300 nm thick or semi - infinite ."

    "<S> we explore this asymmetric contact design in fig.[fig : theory1b]c ( see insets ) . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric absorption is defined as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the slg absorption in the 300 nm area close to the right ( @xmath21=0 ) contact and @xmath44 is the slg absorption in the 300 nm area close to the left ( @xmath21=410  nm ) contact . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 is then proportional to the expected net photovoltage . </S>",
    "<S> an antisymmetric response is obtained , as shown in fig.[fig : theory1b]c . in particular , at 650 nm ( point ( i ) in fig.[fig : theory1b]c ) all the flux is `` pulled '' to the left contact , while at 700 nm ( point ( ii ) in fig.[fig : theory1b]c ) all the flux is `` pushed '' to the right contact . </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , a spectrally - selective region less than 50 nm wide is created , within which the photovoltage abruptly changes sign . outside this region ( </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46580 nm and @xmath47800 nm ) both contacts have similar responses , thus the net photovoltage is zero . yet </S>",
    "<S> , this is not the only response function available . plotted in fig.[fig : theory1b]d is the case of a left contact with @xmath21=770 nm . the response is found to be symmetric around 660 nm . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the peak absorption is 2 - 3 times higher than what a 600 nm slg on sio@xmath4 would absorb in the absence of the contacts . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , optimizing the contacts just for the highest absorption ( i.e. without creating `` clear '' symmetric or antisymmetric response functions ) , the peak absorption exceeds 6% , i.e. a 4-fold increase compared to slg on sio@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if we further limit ourselves to the first 100 nm from the contact edge ( i.e. within the junction ) , then fig.[fig : theory1b]a gives an 8-fold enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> further exploration of the system s response , including absorption in the unexposed ( buried ) slg under the contact , different light polarizations , unpatterned contacts and sio@xmath4 ( 300nm)/si substrate , for both uniform and focused illumination , are consistent with what discussed above ( see methods ) .        </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of all the spps that can be launched in our system is performed by considering a patterned contact with a large @xmath21=20@xmath48 m , illuminated by a narrow 1@xmath48 m width tm - polarized source positioned on top of the grating , as shown by the arrow in fig.[fig : theory2]a . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to plane wave incidence , for which @xmath49 and where only spps compatible with @xmath50 are excited ( see eq.[eq : spp2 ] ) , the focused beam has @xmath51 incident wave vector components . </S>",
    "<S> it thus allows the full spectrum of spps to be excited according to eq.[eq : spp2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> absorbing boundaries are employed in all directions to avoid scattered light from re - entering the computational cell . in fig.[fig : theory2]a the electric - field intensity distribution is plotted at 650 nm . </S>",
    "<S> strong scattering and fields extending many microns away from the grating are observed , both in the au / air and au / sio@xmath4 interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> an intensity oscillation is also observed in the latter , with a period@xmath01.4@xmath48 m . </S>",
    "<S> spps have both longitudinal and transverse field components , the latter being perpendicular to the metal surface@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : theory2]b , c plots the longitudinal @xmath52 and transverse @xmath53 electric field amplitudes at the au / air and au / sio@xmath4 interfaces , as a function of distance @xmath54 from the grating . </S>",
    "<S> a simple decay curve is obtained at the top interface , but an oscillating decay curve is obtained for the bottom interface . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : theory2]d , e report the spatial fourier transform on these fields . </S>",
    "<S> a single peak is found in the top interface , and two in the bottom one : one at exactly the same wavevector as in the top interface , and the other at a larger wavevector . by repeating this procedure at different illumination frequencies we get the spp dispersion shown in fig.[fig : theory2]f . </S>",
    "<S> lines denote the theoretical dispersion curves from eq.[eq : spp ] using au s dielectric function and assuming either an au / air or au / sio@xmath4 interface . </S>",
    "<S> squares indicate the peaks obtained from the simulations by the spatial fourier transforms . in the au / air interface only the au / air spp dispersion curve emerges , while both au / air and au / sio@xmath4 spp dispersions emerge in the au / sio@xmath4 interface . </S>",
    "<S> spps are surface waves bound on a metal / dielectric interface because they exist below the light - cone of the dielectric ( i.e. the phase - space of free propagating modes defined by @xmath55)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spp at the au / sio@xmath4 interface is below both the air and sio@xmath4 light - cones ( i.e. @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , thus can not couple to any free radiation states . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the spps at the au / air interface are below the air light - cone and within the sio@xmath4 light - cone ( i.e. @xmath58 ) , thus they can leak ( tunnel ) into the free radiation states of substrate , explaining why we obtain two spp signals in the au / sio@xmath4 interface . </S>",
    "<S> such leaky waves have been used for spp characterization within the context of leakage radiation microscopy@xcite ( a far - field optical method analyzing the leaked spp waves in glass substrates to characterize spp propagation on the top interface of a flat or nanostructured metal film@xcite ) . in a semi - infinite substrate they will just propagate away . in a finite one , on the other hand , part of the leaked waves will be reflected back to the interface and contribute more to the slg absorption . the dominant effect in photoresponse , </S>",
    "<S> however , remains in the au / air spp , as inferred by the fourier amplitudes in figs.[fig : theory2]b - e , and confirmed by the absorption in fig.[fig : theory1]b , with minimal contribution from au / sio@xmath4 spps at 930 nm .    </S>",

    "<S> ( c ) response curve slope as a function of small sensor arm length.,width=340 ]        besides photodetection , spp+incident wave interference in a mgm architecture also lends itself to label - free surface plasmon biosensing@xcite , whereby slg assumes the role of an integrated transducer providing direct electrical readout , thus eliminating the need for optical measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the use of slg as an integrated transducer was reported in a dielectric waveguide sensor geometry@xcite , but not in surface plasmon sensing . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : biosensor ] assumes that one termination step ( sensor arm hereafter ) has length @xmath59 and the other @xmath60 , so that they are at the highest slopes of fig.[fig : theory1b]a , i.e. in the midplane of the interference oscillation , with one of them at a positive slope and the other at a negative one . in this setup , </S>",
    "<S> the two contacts are at an accidental degeneracy , producing the same interference between spp and incident wave , thus zero net photovoltage under uniform illumination . </S>",
    "<S> if now the dielectric environment around the sensor arms changes by the presence of an analyte , it will cause an increase in @xmath13 , thus an additional phase to both spps . </S>",
    "<S> having the two arms on a different slope in the response curve of fig.[fig : theory1b]a introduces an asymmetry , thus a net photovoltage . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the dielectric change , the larger the photovoltage . </S>",
    "<S> also , the longer the sensor arms , the higher the sensitivity , as the spp will travel a longer distance , therefore sampling more analyte .        </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : biosensor ] numerically tests this idea simulating four pairs of sensor arms , tuned to operate at 678 nm according to fig.[fig : theory1]c : ( i ) @xmath59=410 nm , @xmath60=750 nm , ( ii ) @xmath59=775 nm , @xmath60=1075 nm , ( iii ) @xmath59=1070 nm , @xmath60=1400 nm and ( iv ) @xmath59=1435 nm , @xmath60=1730 nm . in cases ( i)-(iv ) the left arm alternates from being on a positive to a negative slope of the interference diagram of fig.[fig : theory1]c . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the photovoltage in the presence of the analyte is also expected to alternate . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , the analyte is assumed to be a thin film deposited on the sensor arms and to have an @xmath2=1.55 , an average value for dry protein films@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig : biosensor]b plots the asymmetric absorption as a function of analyte thickness . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a linear response , with slope increasing the longer the sensor arms . in fig.[fig : biosensor]c the absolute value of the slope is plotted as a function of the small sensor arm length @xmath59 , and a good linear fit is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> tuning the arm dimensions thus provides an additional tool for controlling and tuning the device s performance and sensitivity . at long arm lengths </S>",
    "<S> , spp losses will limit the sensitivity , but they could be overcome , e.g. by increasing the metal thickness and/or reducing the substrate index to limit spp coupling to the substrate .    </S>",
    "<S> having demonstrated the design versatility of grating - coupled gpds , we now turn to the experimental validation of our predicted spp enhanced slg absorption and photodetection . the general architecture of our experimental devices with plasmonic grating coupler is shown in fig.[graph : graphene_grating]a . </S>",
    "<S> slg is contacted with metallic source and drain electrodes . in order to quantify the enhancement relative to the no - grating case </S>",
    "<S> , we fabricate the grating coupler on top of one of the contacts and leave the other contact flat . </S>",
    "<S> this is the simplest way to break the contacts symmetry and allows the generation of net non - zero photoresponse , even with both contacts illuminated .    </S>",
    "<S> our devices are fabricated as follows . </S>",
    "<S> graphene is produced by mechanical exfoliation of graphite onto an si+300 nm sio@xmath4@xcite and characterized by optical microscopy@xcite and raman spectroscopy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the source and drain contacts are prepared by e - beam lithography and a base metallization layer is deposited by thermal evaporation of 4 nm cr and 50 nm au , employing a lift - off step . the 620 nm period grating </S>",
    "<S> is then defined in a further e - beam lithography step by performing a second thermal evaporation of 50 nm au followed by lift - off . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[graph : graphene_grating]b shows a scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of the device . </S>",
    "<S> a slight asymmetry between the ridges and grooves is detected due to overexposure during e - beam lithography , but this does not change the spectral characteristics of the grating , solely determined by its period . afterwards , the samples are bonded into a chip carrier for electrical and optical characterization .    we perform wavelength dependent photovoltage mapping to determine the spatial pattern of the devices photoresponse . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[graph : grating_pv ] plots the photovoltage maps at different incident wavelengths for polarization perpendicular to the grating ( tm - polarization , 100x ultralong working distance objective , numerical aperture na=0.6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[graph : grating_pv ] also shows the structured grating contact and the flat contact without perturbations . at 514 </S>",
    "<S> nm the photoresponse occurs predominantly at the contacts edges and is of similar magnitude , but opposite polarity , to that of a standard mgm pd@xcite . at 633 nm , fig.[graph : </S>",
    "<S> grating_pv]b indicates that the influence of the grating starts emerging . </S>",
    "<S> 2 - 3@xmath48 m away from the edge of the patterned contact , a photoresponse is visible , even though no junction is present . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is much more pronounced at 785 nm , where the entire structured contact becomes photosensitive , fig.[graph : grating_pv]c , and the photoresponse is enhanced@xmath0400% compared to the flat contact edge . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the responsivity of the device is polarization dependent , as shown in fig.[graph : grating_pv]d . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest photoresponse occurs for perpendicular polarization ( 0@xmath61,tm - polarized light ) .    </S>",
    "<S> m spot size illuminates the grating 4@xmath48 m away from the metal / slg junction . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) schematic of the simulation system . </S>",
    "<S> 300 nm sio@xmath4 on si is assumed for closer matching to the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) absorption in slg . </S>",
    "<S> two polarizations and a flat contact case are considered.,width=340 ]    to have a direct comparison with the experiments , we perform calculations with a focused beam illumination ( 1@xmath48 m width ) on top of the grating,@xmath04@xmath48 m away from the contact edge , as depicted in fig.[graph : theory_focused]a . the termination step length is taken as 1250 nm ( estimated from the sem image in fig.[graph : graphene_grating ] ) and we also include the si substrate with 300 nm sio@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[graph : theory_focused]b plots the absorption in the exposed slg 4@xmath48 m away from the illumination spot for tm polarization , te polarization and a flat contact . </S>",
    "<S> both the theoretical spectral and polarization responses are in excellent agreement with experiments , and verify the strong responsivity above 700 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the normally incident plane wave illumination case , below 700 nm ( see fig.[fig : theory1]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is understood by considering eq.[eq : spp2 ] and fig.[fig : theory2]f . for a normally incident plane wave and focused illumination </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath62 is zero and nonzero , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since the latter case is less restrictive for spp excitation , it results into a wider spp spectrum at both au / air and au / sio@xmath4 interfaces , thus into a wider responsivity compared to the plane wave case ( see methods for details )    in conclusion , we demonstrated the coupling to graphene of surface plasmon polaritons excited in a metallic plasmonic grating and its exploitation in graphene - based photodetection with enhanced responsivity and polarization selectivity . </S>",
    "<S> depending on its dimensions , highly tunable spectral selectivity below 50 nm bandwidth can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> further , the symmetry of the photodetector can be broken making it operable under full illumination , despite identical metal source and drain contacts . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mechanism involves the coupling of light into spps on the patterned contact , and their propagation to the exposed slg area . for uniform coherent illumination , these spps can further interfere with the waves directly incident on the exposed slg , offering a novel tuning capability where the light flux can be attracted or repelled from the contact edge by design . </S>",
    "<S> the whole contact thus becomes a highly tunable polarization- and spectral - selective photosensitive area . </S>",
    "<S> spps and incident wave interference can potentially be employed for ( bio- ) sensing by tailoring the grating dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this may allow a novel plasmonic sensing architecture with high sensitivity and small footprint with direct electrical readout and without complicated optics . </S>",
