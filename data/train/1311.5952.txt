    "we demonstrate that the revival behavior of the length of the bloch vector can not exactly describe the non - markovian effects .    from the point of view of quantitative description",
    ", we can utilize the angle @xmath111 for the bures fidelity @xcite between an initial state @xmath112 and the final mixed states @xmath113 as a measure of the degree for the nonunital non - markovianity .",
    "the general definition of the bures angle is expressed as , @xmath114 the bures angle is an appropriate monotonic distance under a complete positively and trace preserving map of the density matrix . during a markovian dynamical map , the bures angle between the two states always monotonically decreases .",

    "the non - markovian evolving behavior of the inhomogeneity @xmath117 vector from the maximally mixed initial state can represent both the non - markovian effects and the nonunital impacts .",
    "therefore , similar to the definition in @xcite , one measure based on the bures angle is defined as , @xmath118 where the trajectory states @xmath119 are the evolving state from the maximally mixed initial state @xmath120 and the bures angle is @xmath121 $ ] .    in the case of the spin bath model , we can obtain the bures angle between the maximally mixed state and the selectable trajectory state as , @xmath122 figure .",
    "2 shows the effects of the local magnetic field @xmath43 and the bath temperature @xmath123 on the dynamics of the bures angle .",
    "it is found out that the non - markovian revivals of the bures angle are mostly pronounced at the low bath temperature under the resonant condition of @xmath124 . on one hand ,",
    "the non - markovian behavior is suppressed when the detuning case of @xmath125 is considered . with the increasing of detuning , the interactions between the central qubit and bath are weaker than the transition energy of the qubit applied by the local field .",
    "therefore , the impacts of the environment on the dynamics of the qubit become fragile . on the other hand",
    ", the high bath temperature dynamical process can also reduce the non - markovian behavior of the bures angle .",
    "this is the reason that the bath at high temperature appears to be in a very disorderly mixed state .",
    "the information of the qubit very quickly loses to the bath and very little information can return to the system from the environment .",
    "as one efficient application of the nonunital non - markovian dynamics , it is of value to investigate the nonunital non - markovian effects on the precision of quantum estimation .",
    "quantum fisher information @xcite is a key quantity for describing the sensitivity of a quantum state with respect to a parameter @xmath126 .",

    "the dynamical behavior of the quantum fisher information for composite states with respect to the amplitude are shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the oscillation of @xmath148 is markedly strong in the resonant case of @xmath124 . with the increasing of the bath temperature @xmath123 ,",
    "the revivals of @xmath148 are reduced . under the condition of the large detuning @xmath149",
    ", the values of the quantum fisher information weakly oscillate in the vicinity of a certain high value . besides it , the quantum fisher information for composite entangled states @xmath148 is always superior to that for product state @xmath150 .",
    "it is found out that the nonunital non - markovian effects can enhance the precision of quantum parameter estimation .    to furthermore demonstrate the relations of quantum fisher information and nonunital non - markovianity , we study the derivatives of them with respect to time",
    ". the positive derivatives of quantum fisher information denote the backflow of the information from the bath to system , which is regarded as non - markovian behavior .",
    "meanwhile , we use the bures angle to evaluate the degree for nonunital non - markovianity . in figure 4 , the dynamics of @xmath151 is synchronous with that of @xmath152 .",
    "that is , the increase of the quantum fisher information also represents the existence of the nonunital non - markovian effects .",
    "the nonunital non - markovian effects from the environment can be studied by the time - dependent transfer matrix and inhomogeneity vector which are determined by the decoherence factors .",
    "the nonunital non - markovian dynamics of the open system in a spin bath is analytically obtained in the thermodynamics limit by using the special operator method .",
    "we may select any two orthogonal initial states with collinear bloch vectors .",
    "the nonunital non - markovian environment leads to the two evolving states with non - collinear vectors .",
    "the revivals and suppressing of the angles between the two bloch vectors happen in the nonunital non - markovain dynamics , which is different from the monotonic decrease of the angles in the markovian dynamics .",
