    "open quantum systems are at the center of many research fields in physics today , ranging from quantum computing to transport in nanoscale and mesoscopic systems .",
    "in particular , electronic transport in the quantum regime can be considered one of the central subjects in modern solid state physics  @xcite .",
    "transport properties depend strongly on the degree of openness of the system . in important applications ,",
    "the effect of the opening is large , and can not be treated perturbatively .",
    "thus , a consistent way to take the effect of the opening into account for arbitrary coupling strength between the system and the outside world is highly desirable .",

    "elimination of the continuum leads to an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the complex eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian reveals a general phenomenon , namely the segregation of decay widths ( corresponding to the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalues ) .",
    "specifically , in a system weakly coupled to the external world , all states tend to be similarly affected by the opening , but once the coupling reaches a critical value , a sharp reconstitution of the system occurs : almost the entire decay width is shared by a few short - lived states , leaving all other ( long - lived ) states effectively decoupled from the external world . the analogy between decay width segregation and dicke superradiance",
    "@xcite has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , although dicke superradiance is associated with many - body systems , while width segregation occurs also in the one - body case",
    ". we will refer to this phenomenon as the `` superradiance transition '' in the following .",
    "recently , great attention has been given to translating typical quantum optics effects , such as dicke superradiance , into a solid state context  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the superradiance effect has been shown to occur in several mesoscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian approach to open systems has been used mainly under the assumptions of random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite .",
    "more realistic systems have also been studied , such as nuclei  @xcite and billiards  @xcite . in the latter example , segregation of resonance widths",
    "has already been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian technique has also been applied to phenomenological open tight - binding models in solid state physics  @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the existence of a superradiance transition in such models was shown , but the explicit connections to realistic systems were not considered .",
    "for instance , one might ask whether in a realistic situation the coupling to the external environment can be increased up to the point where a superradiance transition occurs . also , the energy dependence of the effective hamiltonian is not easy to treat exactly , so one might ask in which realistic applications this energy dependence can be neglected .    in this paper , we consider the problem of transport through a sequence of potential barriers , see fig .  [ pwell ] , which can be considered a paradigmatic model in solid state physics .",
    "this potential profile appears in real applications , such as semiconductor superlattices or one - dimensional arrays of quantum dots , and has been widely discussed in the literature  @xcite .    the case of equally spaced potential barriers",
    "has been analyzed previously  @xcite . here a different and more general approach to the problem is considered .",
    "first , we show that for weak tunneling coupling among the wells , an _ energy - independent _ effective hamiltonian approach produces excellent agreement with an exact ( numerical ) treatment of the problem .",
    "moreover , it is shown that even in this simple system a superradiance transition occurs as the coupling to the external world is increased by decreasing the widths of the external potential barriers . with the aid of the effective hamiltonian approach ,",
    "we recover several previous results and shed new light on the essential features of this well - studied model , allowing for a detailed understanding of the resonance structure .",
    "we emphasize that the powerful effective hamiltonian formalism is not in any way limited to simple models of this type , and can be applied to situations where exact treatment is difficult or impossible . in order to show this",
    ", we also analyze the case of random spacings among the potential barriers , and observe the consequences of the superradiance transition in the anderson localization regime .",

    "[ sec_anderson ] , we consider the superradiance transition in the anderson localization regime , as a function of the disorder strength .",
    "the effective hamiltonian approach shows great promise in experimental applications , such as quantum dots  @xcite and photonic crystals  @xcite .",
    "we also believe that the superradiance transition can play a major role in explaining many of the results found in open mesoscopic systems  @xcite . even if this effect has often been neglected in the literature .",

    "is increased , a rearrangement of the widths @xmath29 occurs .",
    "this rearrangement is usually referred to as the `` superradiance '' transition .    in order to understand the origin of this transition",

    "this simple example suggests that a transition between these two regimes may take place at a critical value of @xmath31 .",
    "roughly , the transition occurs when @xmath38  @xcite , where @xmath39 is the mean level spacing of @xmath32 .",
    "note that the qualitative criterion @xmath38 for the transition to superradiance is valid in the case of uniform density of states and negligible energy shift ; when the density of states is not uniform , the transition to superradiance occurs as a hierarchical process  @xcite . in the case of a non - negligible energy shift ,",

    "[ sec_sr ] .    from the above discussion",
    "it should be clear that the superradiance transition emerges in the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian approach as a general phenomenon , depending not on the details of the system , but only on the factorized structure of @xmath35 .",
    "let us consider quantum transport through a sequence of @xmath40 potential barriers , see fig .",

    "we will now proceed to build an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian to describe the quantum transport through a sequence of potential barriers .",
    "a sequence of @xmath0 potential wells can be thought of as a closed system coupled to the continuum of scattering states through the external barriers .",
    "changing the external barrier widths or heights will change the coupling to the continuum . in the limit of low tunneling coupling among the wells ,",
    "the usual tight binding approximation can be used to model the closed system : we define the intrinsic basis states @xmath54 as the bound states in each potential well , corresponding to a certain energy level @xmath55 .",

    "as we decrease the external barrier widths , the transmission increases and near @xmath84 two of the resonances start to overlap . at @xmath118 , they merge , forming a broad resonance .",
    "this shows that the superradiance transition has a clear signature in the resonance structure . as the external barrier widths continue to decrease , the height of the superradiant resonance decreases ( see the case @xmath119 in fig .  [ n5 ] ) , until it disappears entirely for large @xmath114 , due to destructive interference between the two superradiant states . in this limit , @xmath120 narrow resonances remains .",
    "the fact that two resonances disappear for very large coupling is not surprising ; indeed in the absence of the two external barriers , we simply have a system of @xmath120 wells . what is interesting is that the two individual resonances disappear long before the external barriers vanish , indeed immediately after the superradiance transition .",

    "[ n5 ] that results obtained from the effective hamiltonian model are indistinguishable from numerical results obtained by matching the wave functions .",

    "the superradiant states disappear much faster as we increase @xmath114 above the critical value , i.e. , the superradiance transition becomes increasingly sharp .",
    "interestingly , the critical value of @xmath114 becomes both @xmath0-independent and @xmath55-independent in the large-@xmath0 limit , with the transition occurring at @xmath84 , in agreement with previous results  @xcite .",

    "we have shown the localization length remains constant as the opening changes , but the transmission has a maximum as a function of the coupling to the external world . the critical value of the coupling increases with the degree of disorder , and we obtain an estimate of the critical value for strong and weak disorder , based on the superradiance mechanism .    in the future it will be interesting to study the consequences of the superradiance transition beyond the single particle approximation , where electron - electron interactions play an important role .",
