    "for such a sheet , the equilibrium shape is determined primarily by the energy of the graphene sheet edges .",
    "edge energies are related to the thermodynamically stable shape in exactly the same way that surface energies are used to predict the equilibrium shape of a three dimensional crystal through the wulff construction  @xcite .",
    "the second is associated with equilibrium elastic distortions of the graphene sheet as a result of edge stresses ( analogous to surface stresses for a three - dimensional crystal ) .",
    "several recent studies  @xcite have shown that the two highest symmetry graphene edges have compressive edge stresses , leading to elastic distortions of the regions near these sheet edges ( edge warping ) . in this paper",

    "we employ these results to investigate the equilibrium shape of a finite graphene sheet ; both for the flat sheet ( a two - dimensional intrinsic manifold ) and one for which elastic distortions are permitted ( a two - dimensional sheet embedded in three dimensions ) .",
    "in order to determine the properties of the edges of graphene sheets , we employ density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite within the local density approximation ( lda ) using a self - consistent pseudopotential method , as implemented in the siesta code@xcite . a double-@xmath2 plus polarization basis set is used for the localized basis orbitals along with a large energy cutoff ( 400  ry ) for the real space integration .",
    "an electronic temperature of 0.01  ev is used to smear the fermi - dirac distribution . in order to study graphene sheet edges , we focus on flat graphene nanoribbons ( gnr ) that are periodic in one direction and",
