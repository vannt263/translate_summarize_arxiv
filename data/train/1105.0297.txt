    "understanding the mechanical behavior of fluid - saturated granular systems ( e.g. , soils , rocks , concretes , powders , and chemical reactors ) hinges upon a detailed description of the stress exchange between fluid and solid phases .",

    ", the displacement of the grains creates a dynamically changing domain for the fluid flow . the combination of these two effects results in nontrivial physically measurable effects , which are hard to capture by first - principles derivations alone . despite the important practical applications that are touched by fluid - saturated granular systems",
    ", no model currently exists that can efficiently reproduce the precise evolution of large systems over different stress conditions in 3d problems .",
    "this work represents a first step in the direction of developing a fully - coupled , computationally efficient model for the evolution of fluid - saturated granular materials under stress .",
    "in particular , we will focus our effort on the faithful approximation of the forces applied by the fluid on the solid grains , with the aim of incorporating these forces in the _ discrete element method _ ( dem ) computations @xcite .    while the movement of the solid grains can be efficiently modeled by dem computations , viscous fluid computations in dynamically changing domains present incredible computational challenges . at the microscopic ( sub - pore ) scale ,",
    "fluid flow is governed by stokes equations , which express fluid mass and momentum conservation at small reynolds and stokes numbers : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are the microscopic fluid velocity and piezometric pressure , respectively , @xmath3 is the fluid dynamic viscosity , and @xmath4 is a potential field ( e.g. , gravitational field ) . the piezometric pressure @xmath2 is related to the absolute pressure @xmath5 via @xmath6 equations - are augmented with a no - slip boundary condition for the fluid velocity , at the grain boundaries , @xmath7 , which is essentially responsible for the microscopic viscous energy losses ( drag ) that translate in a net loss of the macroscopic piezometric pressure , @xmath2 , over the length of a porous column .    at centimeter scale ( and above ) , for relatively homogeneous porous materials , fluid flow is governed by darcy law , which states the linear proportionality between the macroscopic pressure gradient @xmath8 and the fluid flux @xmath9 ( discharge per unit area ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the permeability .",
    "darcy law emerges as a volume averaging of the viscous forces applied by the fluid flow at the surface of the grains over a sufficiently large number of pores .",
    "recent advances in porous media imaging techniques give access to an unprecedented level of pore - space detail , down to the micrometer scale and below , where the stokes equations could be , in principle , solved numerically .",
    "the numerical solution of the stokes equations in spheres assemblies is , however , computationally expensive , and becomes prohibitive on commodity desktop computers for number of particles exceeding the hundreds . on the other hand , typical dem simulations ,",
    "can easily handle assemblies with number of particles ranging between @xmath12 and @xmath13 on the same commodity desktop computers , and compute their evolution over @xmath13 time - steps or more ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore obvious that a direct coupling of stokes equations and dem simulations becomes unfeasible for real - world problems , hence the need to develop an upscaled fluid model that minimizes the ratio between the degrees of freedom ( dofs ) in the fluid and the number of solid particles .",
    "the past thirty years have seen a considerable effort in the exact upscaling of equations - , i.e. , on how to obtain expressions for the permeability @xmath11 from the knowledge of the microscopic flow .",
    "upscaling techniques such as the volume averaging with closure ( @xcite ) , and homogenization ( @xcite ) invariably require the solution of a ( tensorial ) stokes problem , which has essentially the same algorithmic complexity of the `` original '' stokes fluid flow problem . in this work",
    "we will not be concerned with this type of theoretical upscaling issues .",
    "rather , we will focus our attention to the derivation of a physically based , simplified model of flow through porous materials that overcomes the numerical issues associated with the solution of the full stokes problem .",
    "different strategies have been adopted in the past for the solution of the fluid - solid coupling , which essentially differ in the modeling techniques adopted for the fluid part of the problem , as reviewed below .",

    "finite element methods ( fems ) are often used because of their flexibility in the definition of the numerical mesh .",
    "fem meshes in three dimensions tend to be , however , very large and so do the computer memory footprint and computational times needed for the solution of the associated nonlinear system of equations .",
    "@xcite , for instance , reported computational costs of approximately 0.1s per particle and per time - step in fluidization simulations on a sgi origin 2000 , employing an advanced fictitious domain method and a partially parallelized code : extrapolating these values to a number of particle typical of dem problems , results in computational times in the order of 3 - 30 years .",
    "a numerical method that does not resort to the solution of large systems of nonlinear equations is the lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) scheme .",

    "these studies , however , were limited to 2d models of discs assemblies , where pores were defined by closed loops of particles in contact .",
    "since such pore geometry does not offer any free path for fluid exchanges , 2d problems implied some arbitrary definition of the local conductivity , assuming virtual channels between adjacent voids .",
    "adapting this approach to 3d spheres assemblies enables the definition of the local hydraulic conductivity using the actual geometry of the packing , as spheres packings always define an open network of connected voids .",
    "this in turns opens up the possibility of predicting both the macro - scale permeability and the forces acting on the individual particles rather than postulating it : this is the central theme of this work .",
