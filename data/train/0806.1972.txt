    "quantum computers are hypothetical devices that represent and process information according to the principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "if built , they could solve certain problems , such as factoring integers @xcite , dramatically faster than classical computers .    while the earliest algorithms for quantum computers were based on fourier sampling ,",
    "the concept of _ quantum walk _",
    "@xcite subsequently led to a new class of quantum algorithms .",
    "a quantum walk is a quantum mechanical analog of a classical random walk . by exploiting interference effects",
    ", quantum walks can outperform random walks at certain computational tasks : there are black - box problems for which quantum walk provides an exponential speedup over classical computation @xcite , and many quantum walk algorithms achieve polynomial speedup over classical computation for problems of practical interest @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to define a quantum analog of a random walk , but perhaps the simplest is the continuous - time quantum walk generated by the adjacency matrix @xmath2 of some graph @xcite .",
    "this quantum walk takes place on a hilbert space spanned by orthonormal basis states corresponding to vertices of the graph , and the evolution of the walk for time @xmath3 is described by the unitary operator @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "the quantum walk is simply the schrdinger dynamics of a particle allowed to hop between adjacent vertices of the graph .",
    "the goal of this article is to explore the power of quantum walk as a general model of computation . in particular ,",
    "i show that even a rather restricted kind of quantum walk is _ universal _ for quantum computation , meaning that any problem that can be solved by a general - purpose quantum computer can also be solved by a quantum walk .",
    "( this parallels the situation for adiabatic evolution , which is also universal @xcite . )",
    "there are at least two motivations for demonstrating this universality .",
    "first , it shows that quantum walk is computationally powerful , since in principle , any quantum algorithm can be recast as a quantum walk algorithm .",
    "indeed , these two models are equivalent , since the quantum walk on any sufficiently sparse graph can be efficiently simulated by a universal quantum computer @xcite . not only",
    "does this provide renewed motivation to search for quantum walk algorithms , but the specific construction may suggest new algorithmic approaches .",
    "second , this construction may provide tools for quantum complexity theory , as discussed further below .",
    "a related result was shown by feynman in one of the earliest papers on quantum computation , which constructs a hamiltonian that can implement an arbitrary quantum computation @xcite .",
    "while feynman s motivation was to give a physically reasonable model of a quantum mechanical computing device , his result can also be loosely interpreted as showing the universality of quantum walk . in some sense",
    ", any time - independent hamiltonian dynamics can be viewed as a quantum walk on a weighted , directed graph , with weights on opposite edges occurring in complex conjugate pairs to satisfy hermiticity . however , the interpretation of hamiltonian dynamics as a quantum walk on a graph is clearest when the graph is sparse and the the edges are unweighted . in feynman s",
    "construction , the degree of the underlying graph grows with the size of the computation , and the edges must have weights .",
    "this article presents an alternative hamiltonian for universal quantum computation . in this construction ,",
    "the edges are unweighted , and the graph has maximum degree @xmath5 ( which can not be improved , since graphs of maximum degree @xmath6 clearly can not be universal ) .",
    "the main idea of the construction is to represent computational basis states by quantum wires , and to implement quantum gates by scattering off widgets attached to ( and connecting ) the wires . for a circuit on @xmath7 quantum bits , the graph consists of @xmath8 wires , together with the attached widgets .",
    "each wire can be idealized as infinitely long , but in practice can be well approximated using only @xmath9 vertices .",
    "the computation begins at a single vertex on the far left side of one of the quantum wires , and the outcome of the computation corresponds to the wire on the far right side to which the state evolves under the quantum walk .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "is bounded above @xmath1 ; this eigenvalue gives the dominant contribution to ( [ eq : transfertransmit ] ) , and the transmission coefficient is exponentially small in @xmath102 .",

    "since @xmath105 , each instance of the widget effectively lengthens the wire by two units at this momentum .",

    "generically , two distinct momentum components propagate at different speeds , and hence can be isolated temporally",
    ". however , these particular momentum components have the same group velocity ( [ eq : groupvel ] ) .",
    "to isolate the two components , we can use the widget shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : widgets]@xmath85 , which has a different effective length for @xmath88 and @xmath99 . for widgets @xmath66@xmath84 holds because those graphs are all bipartite .",

    "furthermore , the derivative of the phase of the transmission coefficient gives @xmath107 at @xmath88 , and @xmath108 at @xmath99 .",
    "since the effective length of the widget is different for these two momenta , it serves to temporally separate them .",
    "@xmath85 ) . ]",
    "it is straightforward to combine these widgets to simulate an arbitrary @xmath109-gate quantum circuit : simply connect the widgets in sequence corresponding to the gates in the original circuit . for momentum @xmath88",
    ", the transmission coefficients of the resulting graph exactly implement the desired circuit .",
    "furthermore , the effective lengths ( [ eq : efflength ] ) and curvatures ( [ eq : curvature ] ) at @xmath88 simply add , so both are proportional to @xmath109 for the overall graph .",
    "however , a propagating wave packet comprises a range of momenta , so we need to determine how close @xmath33 must be to @xmath92 such that the transmission gives a good approximation to the desired circuit . in turn , this determines how many filter widgets to include .    to understand how gate widgets behave under composition , it is helpful to view the scattering problem in terms of @xmath8 input channels scattering into @xmath8 output channels .",
    "define matrices @xmath110 , describing forward transmission , reflection from forward to backward , backward transmission , and reflection from backward to forward , respectively , as [ eq : tmat ] _",
    "j , j & = t_j_in , j_out & _ j , j & =    r_j_in & j = j + t_j_in , j_in & j j     +     r_j_out & j = j + t_j_out , j_out & j j    [ eq : rbarmat ] for @xmath111 . and @xmath112 .",
    "however , this does not hold when composing distinct widgets . ]",
    "if we place two widgets in series , we can compute the transmission and reflection matrices for the composed widget as follows : _ 12 & = _ 1 ( 1-_2|_1)^-1 _ 2 [ eq : tcompose ] + _ 12 & = _ 1 + _ 1 ( 1-_2|_1)^-1 _ 2 |_1 [ eq : rcompose ] +     expressions can be obtained by constructing the scattering states for the composed widget out of scattering states for the individual widgets .",
    "for example , to construct @xmath113 , we begin by concatenating @xmath114 ( with its output wires removed ) and @xmath115 ( with its input wires removed ) .",
    "this state fails to satisfy the eigenvalue condition only at the boundary between the widgets , so we attempt to correct this by including a reflection off widget @xmath6 : we add @xmath116 to the state of widget @xmath1 . continuing to add terms corresponding to all the possible ways for waves to reflect between the two widgets , we obtain an infinite series that satisfies the eigenvalue condition even at the widget boundary . summing this geometric series , we obtain ( [ eq : tcompose ] ) and ( [ eq : rcompose ] ) , and a similar construction of the states @xmath117 gives ( [ eq : tbarcompose ] ) and ( [ eq : rbarcompose ] ) .",
    "now we can see that the composition of two widgets , each with little reflection , also has little reflection .",
    "in particular , suppose @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "then we have _ 12 & _ 1 + ( 1-|_1_2)^-1 _ 2   + & _ 1 + ( 1 + _ 1 _ 2)_2 , as well as a similar bound for @xmath120 . furthermore ,",
    "forward transmission through the compound widget is nearly described by the product of the two forward transmission matrices , since _ 12 - _ 1 _ 2 & = _ 1 ( - 1 ) _ 2   + & - 1   + & =   + & _ 1_2 ( 1+_1_2 ) .",
    "we can apply these bounds to study the transmission through @xmath109 gate widgets for momenta near @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , suppose @xmath121 ; then @xmath122 for each of the gate widgets .",
    "applying the bounds recursively , we find that the collection of all @xmath109 gate widgets has @xmath123 for such momenta ; in other words , the transmission is nearly perfect .    to filter out all undesired momenta ,",
    "suppose we precede the gate widgets by @xmath124 filter widgets .",
    "then the output of the filter has exponentially small amplitude except for momentum components @xmath33 with @xmath121 and @xmath125 .",
    "it remains to show that bound states of the graph can be neglected .",
    "since bound states decay as @xmath126 , we can effectively ignore bound states with , say , @xmath127 by starting the walk a distance @xmath128 from the first widget .",
    "this choice increases the required running time of the simulation , but only by a polynomial factor .    strictly speaking",
    ", the above argument leaves open the possibility that a large number of very weakly bound states could influence the scattering behavior .",
    "however , since the bound states in question have @xmath129 , they have the very similar energies @xmath130 .",
    "thus , for @xmath131 , the phases of the weakly bound states of type @xmath132 in ( [ eq : evolution ] ) are all the same up to @xmath133 , and similarly for the weakly bound states of type @xmath134 .    to have nearly identical phases for both types of bound states , we can simply choose an evolution time @xmath3 for which the phase difference @xmath135 is zero . for propagation precisely at momentum @xmath88 , corresponding to the group velocity @xmath136 , we would ideally choose @xmath137 , where @xmath54 is the total effective length of all widgets at @xmath88 . however , we can vary @xmath3 slightly without significantly affecting the contribution from the scattering states . specifically",
    ", we choose @xmath138 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath139 , where the phase @xmath140 is independent of @xmath141 and the choice of @xmath142 . in other words ,",
    "all weakly bound states enter with approximately the same phase .",
    "moreover , the momentum for which the phase is stationary ( i.e. , satisfying ( [ eq : stationary ] ) ) remains @xmath143 , so the contribution from the scattering states is essentially unchanged .",
    "now observe that at @xmath144 , the amplitude ( [ eq : evolution ] ) is @xmath0 , and since the initial contribution from the scattering states is negligible , the initial contribution from the bound states is also negligible .",
    "since the relative phases between weakly bound states at a time @xmath131 can only change by @xmath133 , the amplitude deviation caused by neglecting the bound states in ( [ eq : evolution ] ) is @xmath133 , which will turn out to be dominated by the contribution from the scattering states .",
    "overall , an arbitrary @xmath109-gate quantum circuit describing a unitary transformation @xmath145 on @xmath7 qubits can be implemented by quantum walk as follows . on the input wire @xmath146 ,",
    "we place @xmath147 filter widgets , followed by a momentum separation widget .",
    "we then add widgets for the @xmath109 gates in the circuit , each with @xmath8 inputs and @xmath8 outputs .",
    "the @xmath8 input wires , @xmath8 output wires , and @xmath102 filter wires are all truncated ( as discussed at the end of sec .  [ sec : scatter ] ) at length greater than @xmath148 ( say , length @xmath149 ) , where @xmath54 is the total effective length of the filter , momentum separation , and gate widgets .",
    "initially , the computer is prepared in the state @xmath150 corresponding to vertex @xmath12 on input line @xmath0 , where @xmath128 as discussed above .",
    "we evolve this state with the hamiltonian given by the adjacency matrix of the graph for time @xmath151 . finally",
    ", we measure in the vertex basis .",
    "if the outcome is on some output wire @xmath152 ( which happens with probability @xmath153 ) , we output that @xmath154 ; otherwise we discard the result and start over .    conditioned on obtaining a valid output ,",
    "the statistics of this simulation closely reproduce those of the original quantum circuit . according to ( [ eq : evolution ] ) ,",
    "the amplitude to propagate to vertex @xmath0 on output line @xmath154 is well approximated by 0,s_out|e^-h t|x,0_in _",
    "-^0 e^kx-2tk t_0_in , s_out(k ) 26 - 12mu dk , which by ( [ eq : stationaryphase ] ) ( and the construction of the graph ) is approximately @xmath155 .",
    "the construction described in this article shows that quantum walk is a universal computational primitive , in the sense that any quantum computation can be efficiently simulated by a quantum walk on a sparse , unweighted graph .",
    "in addition to establishing the universality of quantum walk , it is possible that ideas from this construction could be applied elsewhere in quantum information processing .",
    "we conclude by briefly mentioning some of these possibilities .",
    "one potential application is the design of quantum algorithms based on scattering on graphs . in such algorithms , we need not think of scattering as directly implementing quantum gates on one or two qubits , but rather , as a generic way of implementing transformations on quantum states . an early proposal along these lines was made in @xcite in the context of decision trees , and an algorithm for evaluating balanced binary game trees using similar ideas was given in @xcite .",
    "indeed , generalizations of this approach have led to quantum algorithms for evaluating broad classes of formulas @xcite .",
    "another possible application is to quantum complexity theory .",
    "feynman s original quantum computer hamiltonian @xcite has been used to construct qma - complete @xcite and bqp - complete @xcite problems , in addition to showing the universality of adiabatic evolution @xcite .",
    "the quantum walk construction could potentially be applied to construct new complete problems or adiabatic quantum computers with desirable properties .",
    "finally , this construction might be useful in the development of new architectures for quantum computers .",
    "although we have not concerned ourselves with the physical representation of the computer , the graph inherits a kind of tensor product structure from the underlying circuit , so it might be possible to encode the system such that the hamiltonian involves only local interactions between qubits .",
    "such a construction could potentially be used to design a quantum computer that does not require dynamic control @xcite .",
