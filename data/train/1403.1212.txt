    "the possibility of dark matter being in the form of `` dark atoms '' has been studied extensively  @xcite . in this scenario new stable particles are bound by new dark forces ( like mirror partners of ordinary particles bound by mirror electromagnetism  @xcite ) .",
    "however , it turns out that even stable electrically charged particles can exist hidden in dark atoms , bound by ordinary coulomb interactions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "stable particles with charge -1 ( and corresponding antiparticles as tera - particles @xcite ) are excluded due to overproduction of anomalous isotopes .",
    "however , negatively doubly charged particles are not constrained by anomalous isotope searches as much as -1 charged particles  @xcite . there",
    "exist several types of particle models where heavy stable -2 charged species , @xmath14 , are predicted :    * ac - leptons , predicted as an extension of the standard model , based on the approach of almost - commutative geometry @xcite . *",
    "technileptons and anti - technibaryons in the framework of walking technicolor ( wtc ) @xcite .",
    "all these models also predict corresponding + 2 charge particles .",
    "if these positively charged particles remain free in the early universe , they can recombine with ordinary electrons in anomalous helium , which is strongly constrained in terrestrial matter .",
    "therefore a cosmological scenario should provide a mechanism which suppresses anomalous helium .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms than can provide a suppression :    * the abundance of anomalous helium in the galaxy may be significant , but in terrestrial matter a recombination mechanism could suppress this abundance below experimental upper limits @xcite .",
    "the existence of a new u(1 ) gauge symmetry , causing new coulomb - like long range interactions between charged dark matter particles , is crucial for this mechanism .",
    "this leads inevitably to the existence of dark radiation in the form of hidden photons .",
    "* free positively charged particles are already suppressed in the early universe and the abundance of anomalous helium in the galaxy is negligible @xcite .",
    "these two possibilities correspond to two different cosmological scenarios of dark atoms .",
    "the first one is realized in the scenario with ac leptons , forming neutral ac atoms @xcite .",
    "the second assumes a charge asymmety of the @xmath14 which form the atom - like states with primordial helium @xcite .",
    "if new stable species belong to non - trivial representations of the su(2 ) electroweak group , sphaleron transitions at high temperatures can provide the relation between baryon asymmetry and excess of -2 charge stable species , as it was demonstrated in the case of wtc @xcite .",
    "after formation in the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , @xmath15 screens the @xmath14 charged particles in composite @xmath16 _ @xmath17",
    "_ `` atoms '' @xcite . in all the models of @xmath17",
    ", @xmath14 behaves either as a lepton or as a specific  heavy quark cluster \" with strongly suppressed hadronic interactions .",
    "therefore @xmath17 interactions with matter are determined by the nuclear interactions of @xmath18 .",
    "these neutral primordial nuclear interacting objects can explain the modern dark matter density and represent a nontrivial form of strongly interacting dark matter @xcite .",
    "the cosmological scenario of the @xmath17 universe can explain many results of experimental searches for dark matter @xcite .",
    "such a scenario is insensitive to the properties of @xmath14 , since the main features of the @xmath17 dark atoms are determined by their nuclear interacting helium shell . in terrestrial matter",
    "such dark matter species are slowed down and can not cause significant nuclear recoil in the underground detectors , making them elusive in direct wimp search experiments ( where detection is based on nuclear recoil ) such as cdms , xenon100 and lux  @xcite .",
    "the positive results of dama and possibly cresst and cogent experiments @xcite can find in this scenario a nontrivial explanation due to a low energy radiative capture of @xmath17 by intermediate mass nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown @xcite that a two - component dark atom scenario is also possible .",
    "along with the dominant @xmath14 abundance , a much smaller excess of positively doubly charged techniparticles can be created .",
    "these positively charged particles are hidden in wimp - like atoms , being bound to @xmath14 . in the framework of wtc such positively charged techniparticles",
    "can be metastable , with a dominant decay channel to a pair of positively charged leptons . in this paper",
    "we show that even a @xmath19 fraction of such positively charged techniparticles with a mass of 1 tev or less and a lifetime of  @xmath20 , decaying to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 can explain the observed excess of cosmic ray positrons , being compatible with the observed gamma ray background .",
    "one should note that as it was shown in @xcite ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) the case of -2 charged stable particles is significantly different from the case of stable or metastable particles with charge -1 , avoiding severe constraints on charged particles from anomalous isotope searches and bbn due to their catalytic effects ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in the essence this difference comes from the fact that primordial he formed in bbn , captures -2 charged particles in neutral ohe states , while -1 charged particles are captured by he in + 1 charged ions , which either ( if stable ) form anomalous isotopes of hydrogen , or ( if long - lived , but metastable ) catalyze processes of light element production and influence their abundance .",
    "nuclear physics of ohe is in the course of development , but a qualitative analysis has shown @xcite that the ohe interactions with matter should not lead to overproduction of anomalous isotopes , while ohe catalytic effects in bbn can lead to primordial heavy element production , but not to overproduction of light elements .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we give a brief review of dark atoms made of stable charged techniparticles . in section 3",
    "we present the constraints and the predictions of the scenario with respect to the parameters of the technicolor model we use as well as how the ratio of lepton over baryon number is deduced . in section 4",
    "we show what gut operators can implement the decay of the doubly charged particle to leptons . in section 5 ,",
    "we show how the scenario of decaying dark matter can be realized , and how it can explain the pamela and ams-02 results while satisfying the fermi / lat constraints .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "technicolor theories that do not violate the electroweak precision tests , while not introducing large flavor changing currents , have been extensively studied lately  ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "old models where fermions transformed under the fundamental representation of the gauge group , required a large number of flavors ( for a given number of colors ) in order to be close to the conformal window and thus to suppress the flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "the need for many flavors coupled to the electroweak sector ( that violates the electroweak precision measurements ) disfavored technicolor in the past .",
    "however it has been demonstrated that once one allows fermions to transform under higher representations of the gauge group , quasi - conformality can be achieved even with a small number of colors and flavors  @xcite .",
    "this means that there is a set of technicolor models that evade the strict constraints of the electroweak tests , making technicolor a viable candidate for the tev energy scale .",
    "apart from the perturbative calculation of the oblique parameters  @xcite in this type of models , non - perturbative calculations based on holographic descriptions  @xcite showed that indeed the oblique s parameter can be small .",
    "note that the oblique parameters ( e.g. s , t , and u ) measure the modifications of the standard model gauge boson vacuum polarization amplitudes caused by contributions of new physics .",
    "these parameters are severely constrained by electroweak precision tests .",
    "extra flavors that couple to the electroweak sector contribute to these parameters and can potentially exclude a model .",
    "one of the simplest models that possesses the features described above , is the so called minimal walking technicolor  @xcite .",
    "the theory consists of two techniquarks transforming under the adjoint representation of an @xmath21 gauge group , and an extra family of leptons @xmath22 and @xmath23 coupled to the electroweak in order to cancel the global witten anomaly .",
    "the hypercharge assignment can be chosen consistently ( without introducing gauge anomalies ) such that one of the techniquarks has zero electric charge .",
    "such a simple theory can have a variety of dark matter candidates , ranging from dark matter particles that are goldstone bosons of the theory ( with nonzero technibaryon number )  @xcite , or majorana wimps  @xcite .",
    "apart from these possibilities , there is another intriguing scenario , that of an electromagnetic bound state between a @xmath1 charged helium nucleus with a @xmath0 charged techniparticle  @xcite .",
    "more specifically in  @xcite , we examined the possibility where the dark matter bound state is @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "recall that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the two techniquarks of the theory and @xmath22 and @xmath23 the extra leptons .",
    "there is a gauge anomalous free hypercharge assignment where the charges of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively @xmath28 , 0 , @xmath29 , and @xmath0 .",
    "we should also emphasize that due to the fact that techniquarks transform under the adjoint representation of the gauge group , some of the goldstone bosons are colorless di - quarks ( carrying technibaryon number ) .",
    "apparently @xmath30 and @xmath23 have charges @xmath0 .",
    "this candidate @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 being @xmath30 or @xmath23 ) is a strongly interacting massive particle ( simp ) , rather than a wimp due to the large geometric cross section of the helium component . despite the large cross section",
    ", this candidate has not been ruled out by any experiment so far .",
    "amazingly enough , although such a candidate interacts strongly with matter , it can not be detected in earth based detectors ( based on measuring the recoil energy ) like cdms , xenon , or lux . by the time such a particle reaches the detector ,",
    "it has lost most of its kinetic energy making it impossible to produce recoil energies above the detection threshold . in  @xcite , we examined a generalized version of the aforementioned scenario , where although the majority of dark matter is @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) , a small component can be of the wimp form @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) .",
    "such a wimp component must be small since it is constrained by direct detection experiments .    in  @xcite",
    ", we had assumed that techniparticles are stable . in particular with respect to the technibaryons , the symmetry associated with the technibaryon number protected the lightest di - quark goldstone boson from decaying .",
    "here we reexamine the scenario of  @xcite allowing decays of the techniparticles .",
    "it has been demonstrated that decaying dark matter can provide a possible explanation of the unexpected positron excess seen in pamela  @xcite .",
    "decaying of dark matter particles through a dimension-6 operator gives a lifetime ~8 = 5 10 ^ 20 ( ) ^5 ( ) ^4 , [ op6 ] where @xmath35 is the mass of the dark matter particle .",
    "note that we have normalized the lifetime with respect to a gut scale by an order of magnitude lower than the typical value of @xmath36 gev suggested by supersymmetry .",
    "as we are going to argue a small component of dark matter with a mass of @xmath37tev or less and a lifetime of @xmath38 can accommodate nicely the positron excess seen in pamela and ams-02 data .",
    "in addition such a lifetime is sufficiently large in order not to deplete the density of this component of dark matter by today since it is a few orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe .",
    "as it was stressed in  @xcite , dimension-6 operators are very natural objects in technicolor , and therefore such a framework becomes very appealing .",
    "we already mentioned that the mwt has two techniquarks @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the adjoint representation of the technicolor @xmath21 with charges @xmath28 and 0 , and two new leptons @xmath22 and @xmath23 with charges @xmath29 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "the theory possesses a global @xmath39 symmetry that breaks spontaneously to an @xmath40 . out of the 9 goldstone bosons ,",
    "three of them ( with the quantum numbers of the usual pions ) are eaten by the @xmath41 and @xmath42 bosons , while the rest 6 are the colorless di - quarks @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and their antiparticles  @xcite .",
    "we are going to consider two possibilities .",
    "the first one is to have an excess of @xmath0 charge @xmath30 and a little of @xmath1 @xmath46 .",
    "the main component of dark matter is the simp @xmath24 .",
    "there is also a small wimp component of @xmath33 .",
    "the second scenario is to have an excess of @xmath23 and a little of @xmath43 , in such a way that the main simp component of dark matter is @xmath25 and the small wimp one @xmath34 . in both cases",
    "we have assumed that @xmath43 is the lightest among the technibaryons and similarly @xmath23 is the lightest of the new leptons .",
    "the calculation of the relic density of the technibaryons taking into account sphaleron violating processes , weak equilibration and overall charge neutrality gives similarly to  @xcite = -_uu ( + 1 + ) , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the technibaryon , baryon , lepton , and new lepton family number respectively .",
    "@xmath51 are statistical factors for the specific particle @xmath52 given by _",
    "i =    6f ( ) &  , + 6 g ( ) &  ,    where the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined as follows @xmath55     for the two scenarios explained in the text : eqs .",

    "the dark matter density is = + =| | + ( | |- |    @xmath59 are the masses of @xmath34 , @xmath24 and proton respectively .",
    "we have taken the ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter to be @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61 denotes the fraction of the wimp component ( @xmath33 ) of dark matter , then the ratio of leptons over baryons is given by = -3 + 5.47m_p .",
    "[ lb1 ] in the second scenario ( that of @xmath25 and @xmath34 ) ,    = + = + ( - ) , where @xmath62 is the mass of @xmath25 .",
    "the ratio @xmath63 is = -3 -5.47m_p ( + + ) .",
    "[ lb2 ] @xmath61 here is again the fraction of the wimp - like component of dark matter .",
    "there are two points we would like to emphasize .",
    "the first one is that both possibilities give a ratio of lepton over baryon numbers very close to @xmath64 if the masses of @xmath43 and @xmath23 remain around 1 tev .",
    "in fact the first scenario gives a ratio slightly above @xmath64 and the second slightly below .",
    "@xmath63 starts deviating ( exponentially ) as a function of the mass of @xmath43 and/or @xmath23 once we go to masses much higher than 1.5 to 2 tev ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the second point we would like to stress is that @xmath61 is constrained by earth based direct detection search experiments .",
    "in  @xcite we found that the wimp component of this dark matter scenario can not be more than 1% ( or @xmath65 ) . since then , the constraint from the cdms and xenon experiments has improved significantly and more severe constraints from lux appeared .",
    "the cross section of @xmath34 ( or its antiparticle ) with a proton is  @xcite _ p=^2|y^2f^21.8 10 ^ -39 ^ 2 , where @xmath66 i.e. the sum of the hypercharge of left and right components .",
    "it is easy to check that in our case @xmath67 . this is because @xmath43 has @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath23 has @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the total sum is @xmath72 .",
    "in addition since both @xmath43 and @xmath23 are much heavier than the proton , the reduced mass @xmath73 is approximately the mass of the proton .",
    "the form factor @xmath74 depends on the target nucleus and the recoil energy .",
    "for example for ge detector with recoil energies between 20 to 50 kev , the form factor ranges from 0.43 to 0.72  @xcite . here in this estimate of the wimp - proton cross section we have set @xmath75 .",
    "the results of the lux experiment  @xcite exclude wimps with a cross section @xmath76 for a typical wimp mass of 1 tev .",
    "this means that wimps with the cross section of @xmath34 can make up only a component of @xmath77 or smaller of the total dark matter .",
    "here we are going to use a typical value of @xmath57 .",
    "as we mentioned in the previous section , we might have a @xmath78 ( or less ) wimp component in our dark matter framework .",
    "this comes in the form of @xmath33 ( first scenario ) or @xmath34 ( second scenario ) .",
    "our goal is to consider decay processes that can produce the excess of positrons seen in pamela and ams-02 . for this , it is generically better if the @xmath1 objects decay accordingly .    in the first considered scenario",
    "we assume that @xmath30 is stable , and therefore the simp component which consists the overwhelming part of dark matter is unaffected . on the other hand , we assume that @xmath79 can decay to leptons . by construction",
    "since @xmath23 and @xmath22 belong to the same electroweak doublet , @xmath23 couples to @xmath22 and @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath22 is a lepton with an electric charge @xmath29 , it can in principle slightly mix with the usual @xmath29 leptons , i.e. electrons , muons , and taus .",
    "the tiny wimp component of dark matter made of @xmath33 , decays due to the fact that @xmath46 can decay to a @xmath81 and ( via @xmath82 ) to positrons , anti - muons and anti - taus .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is heavier than @xmath23 and therefore the decay is suppressed . in order not to get very fast decays of @xmath46 , the mixing of @xmath83 with positrons etc has to be extremely small .",
    "however this is something expected due to experimental constraints as well as due to the fact that @xmath22 is much heavier than the leptons .",
    "it is also expected that the mixing between @xmath22 and @xmath84 would be larger than @xmath22 and @xmath73 or @xmath22 and positrons .",
    "the decay in this scenario can be accommodated via a dimension-5 operator .",
    "however , decays of @xmath46 to positrons or @xmath3 or @xmath4 can lead to unwanted production of hadrons via decays of @xmath81 .",
    "therefore we focus on the second case .    in the second scenario",
    "the small wimp component is made of @xmath34 . in this case",
    "we assume that @xmath23 is stable ( and no mixing with other leptons exists ) , but the @xmath43 goldstone boson decays via a gut interaction .",
    "a natural dimension-6 operator that can accommodate the decay can be of the form = , where @xmath85 is an electron , muon , or tau .",
    "notice that due to the transpose instead of the bar , such an operator violates both the lepton and the technibaryon number .",
    "it allows a possible decay of @xmath43 to two positrons ( or two anti - muons or anti - taus decays to different species of antileptons , i.e. a positron and an anti - muon etc . ] ) uu e^+ + e^+ .",
    "it is understood that although @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be generic dirac matrices , @xmath86 has to be the charge conjugate matrix in order for @xmath88 to be the pseudo - goldstone boson @xmath43 .",
    "if we require that parity is not violated by the interaction , @xmath87 must also be the charge conjugate matrix . in case parity",
    "is violated , @xmath87 can be @xmath89 ( as it is a well known fact that @xmath90 is a scalar ) .",
    "of course nothing forbids a similar decay of @xmath43 to two quarks or even a quark and a lepton , as it would depend on the details of the gut interaction .",
    "however here we do not want to speculate regarding the gut interactions , but simply to demonstrate that such a realization can in fact produce the positron spectrum seen by experiments .",
    "as we already mentioned , a dimension-6 operator of the above form would give according to eq .",
    "( [ op6 ] ) a lifetime of the order of @xmath91 @xmath92 for a mass of @xmath43 of the order of tev .",
    "if @xmath43 does not decay to hadrons , this scenario is more appropriate for explaining the positron excess compared to the first scenario we mentioned because in the first scenario the decay of @xmath46 will always be accompanied by hadronic decays that are not seen by pamela .",
    "here we show the impact of decaying @xmath43 particles on the cosmic positron flux and diffuse gamma radiation . the so - called  pamela anomaly \" in the cosmic positron spectrum  @xcite",
    "has been recently confirmed also by ams-02 @xcite .",
    "this anomaly can not be explained by positrons of only secondary origin , and therefore primary positron sources are needed to explain the data .",
    "there are attempts to realize it based on decaying or annihilating dark matter models .",
    "any scenario that provides positron excess is constrained by other observational data , mainly from the data on cosmic antiprotons , and gamma - radiation from our halo ( diffuse gamma - background ) and other galaxies and clusters @xcite .",
    "if dark matter does not produce antiprotons , then the diffuse gamma - ray background gives the most stringent and model - independent constraints .    in our scenario",
    "the @xmath43 component of a tiny @xmath34 wimp component of dark matter decays as @xmath93 in principle with different branching ratios .",

    "the leptonic decay modes have been studied extensively ( see e.g. references @xcite ) , using a variety of different approaches in estimating the cr signals . for our estimate",
    ", we adopt the following model of positron propagation in the galaxy . due to energy losses",

    "the effect of the diffusion in the propagation can be estimated by assuming a homogeneous distribution of the sources .",
    "in fact , the result of diffusion is not sensitive to the effects of inhomogeities , because it depends on the averaged density within the diffusion length .",
