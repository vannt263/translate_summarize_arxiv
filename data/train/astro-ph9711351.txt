    "sunspot penumbrae show structures in the form of alternating dark and bright fibrils extending in the radial direction across the penumbra .",
    "observations by beckers & schrter ( @xcite ) have already suggested that the magnetic field inside the dark filaments might be close to horizontal whereas the field in the bright filaments is less inclined with respect to the vertical .",
    "this magnetic field structure has implications for the evershed flow which was also suggested to be associated mainly with the dark filaments .",
    "the association of the evershed flow with the dark penumbral fibrils has recently been confirmed by shine et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and rimmele ( @xcite ) . in these observations",
    ", it was also found that the evershed effect is a quasi - periodic time - dependent phenomenon which extends beyond the penumbral boundary ( rimmele @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence ( rimmele @xcite ) that the evershed flow occurs in thin channels which are elevated above the continuum height for most parts of the penumbra . very recently , westendorp - plaza et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have actually for the first time identified the regions of return flux for the field lines carrying the evershed flow .",
    "their observations support the view that the evershed flow is carried by low - lying field lines .",
    "the suggested spatial variation of the inclination angle of the magnetic field with azimuth was also found by lites et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and degenhardt & wiehr ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , very high resolution observations with the lockheed tunable filtergraph on the swedish solar observatory in la palma ( title et al .",
    "@xcite ) showed that the magnetic field of a sunspot penumbra indeed varies between nearly horizontal in the dark penumbral filaments and much less inclined in the bright filaments .",
    "similar results where obtained by rimmele ( @xcite ) and stanchfieldii et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations of title et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show that the mean inclination of the magnetic field increases from @xmath0-@xmath1 to @xmath2-@xmath3 across the penumbra and that there is a rapid azimuthal variation of the inclination angle of about @xmath4 .",
    "little or no variation of the total field strength with azimuth is found by title et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and rimmele ( @xcite ) ( see , however , the discussion in stanchfieldii et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ) . on the basis of these observations ,",
    "title et al . (",
    "@xcite ) proposed a tentative model for the magnetic field structure , which resembles that of laminated force - free fields ( low @xcite ) . since these fields only exist for cartesian and spherical geometry , the model of title et al .",
    "( @xcite ) could so far not be backed up by a self - consistent calculation .    in a recent paper , martens et al .",
    "( @xcite ) presented a linear force - free model for a fluted sunspot .",
    "the model is able to explain some of the properties of fluted sunspots . due to the high azimuthal wave number of the fluted force - free component ,",
    "the scale height of this component is very small and the flutedness is confined to the chromosphere in this model .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic loops corresponding to the dark filaments are very short in this model and the filaments do consist of a series of loops .",
    "this implies that the evershed flow would have to consist of a phase - coordinated flow along many short loops .",
    "there is no explanation how this could be achieved .",
    "therefore there is a clear need for improved models .",
    "the fundamental problem posed by the observations is that a genuinely three - dimensional solution of the magnetohydrostatic equations is necessary .",
    "though there has been some progress concerning analytical solutions in three dimensions recently ( e.g. neukirch @xcite ) , these solutions do either not apply to the problem or they suffer from the same deficiencies as the linear force - free solutions .",
    "a different approach is therefore necessary .    in the present paper",
    "we present a method which allows us to find a self - consistent version of the model originally put forward by title et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the method is based on an asymptotic expansion of the three - dimensional force - free equations .",
    "the lowest order of this expansion has solutions which are formally equivalent to laminated force - free fields and a large number of different solutions can be found .",
    "these solutions can be used to model the magnetic field of the penumbra of a fluted sunspot .    in the following ,",
    "we first briefly review the theory of laminated force - free fields and then present the expansion procedure .",
    "a specific solution which is useful as a model for a fluted penumbral magnetic field is presented and its properties are discussed especially in connection with a theoretical explanation of the evershed flow .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field of the sunspot penumbra is force - free and therefore obeys the equations @xmath5 from eq .",
    "( [ jcrossb ] ) we conclude that @xmath6 where we have absorbed @xmath7 into @xmath8 .",
    "the observations ( degenhardt & wiehr @xcite ; title et al . @xcite ; rimmele @xcite ) show that simple sunspots may have a fluted penumbra with rapid variations of the inclination of the magnetic field with azimuth ( @xmath9 ) , however with almost constant magnetic pressure at constant radius .",
    "since the azimuthal component of the magnetic field is small compared to the other components and the sunspot field can be considered as being force free , also the electric currents seem to flow mostly in the meridional planes ( @xmath10constant ) .",
    "the appropriate model to describe such a magnetic field would be given by laminated non - linear force - free fields ( low @xcite ) .",
    "however , these fields do only exist in cartesian and spherical coordinates ; in cylindrical coordinates appropriate for the description of sunspots such fields do not exist .",
    "this can be most easily seen as follows .",
    "the basic assumption is @xmath11 then eq . ( [ bdalpha ] )",

    "if we take the curl of eq .",
    "( [ ampere ] ) and multiply the result by @xmath12 we get @xmath13 on the other hand @xmath14 it follows that @xmath15 may not depend on @xmath9 which precludes flutedness for force - free fields in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "this means that only rotationally symmetric equilibria of this type are possible and therefore it is impossible find an exact force - free solution appropriate for fluted sunspots .",
    "however , if we are mainly interested in the penumbral structure , we could try to find an approximate solution with the desired properties , based on laminated equilibria .",
    "we start by writing eqs .",

    "if the radial extent of the penumbra is @xmath19 , we now expand the equations above in the parameter @xmath20 which we assume to be smaller than one ( this is a kind of large - aspect - ratio expansion with @xmath21 being the aspect ratio ) . this type of expansion procedure together with the coordinate transformation eq .",

    "this might seem easy because we have already presented such a function above ( @xmath66 ) . a closer inspection of the inclination angle and the magnetic field components for values of @xmath67 reveals , however , that a naive choice of @xmath68 will cause problems . for @xmath69",

    "[ fig3 ] we show a slice of the full field over two wavelengths in azimuth to emphasize the details of the field structure . especially in fig .  [ fig3 ] we see that the field lines with the maximum inclination form long shallow loops across the penumbra as required for their association with the evershed effect .",
    "we remark that the model could also be modified to include the return flux observed by westendorp - plaza et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . this could be done either by choosing different functions @xmath64 ( or another set of parameters with the same function @xmath64 ) or by extending the domain beyond the penumbral boundary and shifting the origin of the transformed radial coordinate system further out .",
    "there are clear differences between this model and the linear force - free model of martens et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in the present model the field strength drops off with height more or less like @xmath101 for large @xmath41 .",
    "the variation of the inclination angle with height is completely determined by the function @xmath68 we choose , but in any case it will have a much weaker dependence on @xmath41 than the linear force - free model . in the linear force - free model ,",
    "the magnetic field drops off exponentially and the scale height of the fluted part is very small .",
    "this is actually one of the shortcomings of that model .",
    "another difference is that the parts of the penumbra where the field is nearly horizontal do not form rather short loops but quite extended radial loops which can more easily account for the observed evershed flow .",
    "whereas in the linear force - free model the direction and the amplitude of the current density are determined by the magnetic field because @xmath8 is a constant , in the present model @xmath102 is a function of the azimuth .",
    "the relation between @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be calculated either from eq .",
    "( [ zeroorderr ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ zeroorderz ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath104 with the form of @xmath103 given in eq .",
    "( [ deltamod ] ) , we obtain @xmath105 since the cosine has its extrema where the sine has its zeros and vice versa , we have the situation that the maximum current density flows along field lines having the average inclination , whereas the current density vanishes along field lines having the maximum or minimum inclination .",
    "furthermore the direction of the current flow changes its sign every half wave length in azimuth .",
    "this coincides exactly with the discussion given in title et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and sketched in their fig .",
    "this vindicates our approach because it was our aim to come up with a self - consistent version of their schematic model .",
    "an important point to investigate is the quality of the approximation scheme that we have presented . a good way to do",
    "this is to investigate the magnitude of the residual force due to the approximation . to be able to judge the quality of the approximation",
    ", we need to compare the residual force to a quantity of the same dimension . a convenient measure for the strength of the force",
    "is @xmath106 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath107 note that the residual force has only a poloidal component .",
    "one can immediately see that the residual force vanishes at the origin of the transformed coordinate system ( @xmath108 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show a surface plot of the residual force as function of @xmath109 and @xmath41 for @xmath98 .",
    "the plots for the locations of minimum and maximum inclination do not differ very much from this plot .",
    "it can be seen that the residual force is small close to the origin of the transformed radial coordinate system and then rises almost linearly in @xmath109 away from that origin .",
    "this can be understood by an inspection of eq .",
    "( [ joverb ] ) .",
    "most of the variation of the residual force expression obviously comes from the factor @xmath110 .",
    "the factor @xmath111 just seems to be a minor modulation of the first factor .",
    "the plot also shows the limits of the approximation scheme . at the boundaries ( in @xmath109 )",
    "the dimensionless residual force has reached a value of almost @xmath112 which is at the very limit of what can be considered as acceptable for a small parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "we have only considered the lowest order of the expansion scheme and higher order corrections could make the representation of the field even better .",
    "one should also keep in mind that by an expansion procedure like this one can usually not expect to get a convergent series but only an asymptotic series ( though in a mathematically rigorous sense we would still need to prove that the series is indeed asymptotic ) .",
    "we mention as a possibility that in principle , one could integrate the amplitude of the force over the volume under consideration and minimise this integral with respect to the parameter @xmath18 . this would give a kind of optimum value for the location of the origin of the transformed @xmath109-coordinate .",
    "since we expect that the increase in accuracy achieved by such a procedure will be small we have not carried this out here .",
    "we have presented an expansion scheme that allows us to calculate self - consistent force - free solutions of the magnetohydrostatic equations with the basic properties of fluted sunspot penumbrae .",
    "the lowest order of the expansion produces equations which are mathematically equivalent to the equations describing laminated force - free solutions in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the magnetic field then has no toroidal component in the lowest order and the magnetic field strength does not vary with azimuth .",
    "the field inclination , however , can have an arbitrary variation with azimuth . in comparison with the force - free model by martens et al .",
    "( @xcite ) the scale height of this variation is generally much larger .",
    "we have calculated explicit solutions which have a profile of the magnetic field strength in the plane @xmath44 that exactly matches the profile given by beckers & schrter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the field lines emerging from the plane @xmath44 extend across the penumbra in the radial direction and for the maximum inclination angle stay relatively shallow .",
    "our model provides for long , low - lying radial loops that return to the photosphere just beyond the boundary of the penumbra , as is required for the evershed flow , and confirmed by recent observations of westendopr - plaza et al .",
