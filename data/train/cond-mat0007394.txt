    "after the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation in vapors of alkali atoms @xcite , the understanding of their behavior under rotation became the main focus of theoretical and experimental work .",
    "experimental observation of the vortex states in a two - component system@xcite , and the realization of the vortex states in a stirred one - component bose - einstein condensate @xcite confirmed the expectations that sufficiently large condensates exhibit bulk superfluid properties by supporting their rotation above the critical angular frequency by the feynman - onsager vortex state@xcite .",
    "the theoretical approaches to the bose - einstein condensed gases commonly distinguish between the two regimes of the strong and the weak interparticle interactions , which correspond to the conditions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , where @xmath12 is the number of particles in the gas , @xmath13 is the scattering length , and @xmath14 is the oscillator length defined in terms of the oscillator frequency @xmath1 and the boson mass @xmath15 ( for a review see e.g. @xcite . ) in the weak coupling regime , where the scale of the variation of the condensate wave - function is of the same order as the size of the cloud , quantum effects play an essential role and the system behaves much like an atomic nucleus ( see e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the strong coupling regime and for sufficiently large condensate , the condensate is well described in terms of hydrodynamics . under these conditions the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( g - p ) equation@xcite for the ( complex ) condensate wave function reduces to two ( real ) hydrodynamic equations for the density and velocity of the condensate at zero temperature .",
    "one consequence of the assumption that the system is sufficiently large is that the quantum pressure term can be ignored compared with the interaction terms .",
    "another is that the thomas - fermi approximation@xcite is valid and the equilibrium kinetic energy density is negligible compared to the potential energy density .",
    "this approximation also ensures that the thermodynamic quantities like the pressure or the chemical potential of the gas are well defined at any local point of the gas cloud .",
    "finally , the coherence length of the condensate @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being the number density of condensate particles , becomes sufficiently small in this limit to allow for a description of a vortex core as a singularity .",
    "the superfluid hydrodynamic approach has been used in the studies of the collective excitations of the condensate clouds@xcite the scissors mode oscillations@xcite , the moment of inertia of a rotating condensate@xcite , mainly in the irrotational regime ; see however ref .",
    ". the critical angular velocity of condensate , @xmath18 , at which the creation of a vortex is energetically favorable , scales , in units of the trap frequency , as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the size of the cloud ; the numerical coefficient depends on the details of the geometry of the trap@xcite . for a sufficiently large condensate the ground state would correspond to coarse - grained rigid - body rotation supported by a vortex lattice . in this case , the irrotational constraint on the average superfluid velocity @xmath21 is replaced by the rigid - body rotation condition @xmath22 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the study of the oscillations of the trapped bose condensates under rigid - body rotation .",
    "we shall not discuss the modes related to the vortex structure itself ( e.g. tkachenko modes ) .",
    "we shall confine ourselves to the zero - temperature limit , in which case the effects of mutual friction due to the interaction of the thermal excitations with the vortex state , and dissipation due to the viscosity of the thermal component both can be neglected .",
    "below , we shall apply the tensor virial method originally developed for the study of equilibrium and stability of rotating liquid masses bound by self - gravitation@xcite .",
    "the tensor virial method transforms the local hydrodynamical equations into global virial equations that contain the full information on the structure and stability of a system as a whole .",
    "the method is especially useful for studying perturbations of incompressible uniform ellipsoids from equilibrium , in which case the each perturbed virial equation yields ( in the absence of viscous dissipation ) a different set of normal modes .",
    "the extension to compressible flows is straightforward in the case of adiabatic perturbations . moreover ,",
    "when the equilibrium is sustained by an external confining potential , fluid perturbations do not back - react ( change ) the confining potential itself , and the tensor virial method can be extended to non - uniform compressible flows .",
    "the description is particularly useful for gases with polytropic equations of state @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the pressure , @xmath25 is the density , and @xmath26 is the adiabatic index . in that case , we shall see that all of the modes of the gas can be found from the tensor virial equations .",
    "( we illustrate this only for the second harmonic modes of oscillation in this paper , but the extension to higher order modes is straightforward , and will be discussed elsewhere . ) for an interacting bose gas the pressure is a non - analytic function of the diluteness parameter @xmath27 .",
    "however the equation of state to the leading order in the small parameter @xmath28 can be written in a polytropic form : @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "since the zero temperature equations of motion of a trapped rotating condensate turn out formally identical to the corresponding equations of motion of a ordinary ( non - superfluid ) liquid , our results might be of significance in a broader context .",
    "on the other hand , present results can serve as a starting point for an extension to finite temperatures where , in addition to the superfluid , the fluid of normal quasiparticle excitations plays a role .",
