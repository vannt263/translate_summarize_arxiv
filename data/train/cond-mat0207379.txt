    "kondo semiconductors ( or insulators ) , e.g. , smb@xmath8 , ybb@xmath9 , and ce@xmath10bi@xmath11pt@xmath10 , are cousins of heavy - fermion compounds.@xcite both classes of materials behave like kondo - impurity systems at high temperatures , _ f_-electron spins independently scattering conduction electrons .",
    "as the scattering becomes coherent at low temperatures , the heavy - fermion compounds remain metallic , described as a fermi liquid of heavy quasiparticles , while the kondo semiconductors become semiconducting with a small energy gap opening in the excitation spectrum . since the known kondo semiconductors have an even number of electrons per unit cell , it has been suggested that , despite strong electron - correlation effects , they may be viewed as band insulators.@xcite namely , if one occupied _",

    "the other approach takes a view of a two - fluid model , assuming the existence of neutral spin excitations that are decoupled from charged fermi - liquid excitations ( i.e. , charge carriers).@xcite it is claimed that the spin excitations dominate low - temperature thermodynamic properties and that a pseudogap opens only in their spectrum .    in a previous paper",

    "no oscillations are observed .",
    "this may be attributed to that the resistivity at high fields and hence its oscillatory part are so small for field directions close to the _ a _ axis [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) ] .",
    "we begin with the field - dependence of the sdh frequency shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) .",
    "when a sdh frequency depends on the field , the momentary frequency @xmath38 that is experimentally measured differs from the true frequency @xmath39 that is directly connected with an extremal cross - section of the fs ; @xmath40.@xcite this means that ( 1 ) a linear variation in @xmath39 does not affect @xmath38 , and that , ( 2 ) when @xmath39 has non - linear field dependence , the variation in @xmath38 may be enhanced over that in @xmath39 .",
    "a linear zeeman shift of a parabolic energy band leads only to a linear change in a fs cross - section and hence does not affect @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath38 s of oscillations from up- and down - spin electrons remain the same and constant .",
    "the observed field - dependence indicates that the energy band shifts non - linearly with fields and/or that the energy dispersion in the vicinity of the fermi level strongly deviates from quadratic .",
    "when theoretical models become available for comparison , further information can be extracted from the present observation .",
    "we next discuss the fs responsible for the frequency branch shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the size of the observed sdh frequencies , the order of @xmath0100 t , is compatible with the carrier concentration estimated from the hall coefficient with a single - carrier model ; a spherical fs enclosing 10@xmath6 electron / ce would give a sdh frequency of 190 t. the compatibility supports that what we have found from the sdh oscillations is not small structures of a large fs but the major portion of a small but dominant fs .",
    "since the hall resistivity is negative , the observed fs is an electron pocket .",
    "note that , even if the measured hall resistivity contains some contribution from hole carriers , the above line of argument is still valid . in that case , the true carrier number is smaller than the single - carrier - model estimation , and hence it becomes even more unlikely that larger fs s are hidden .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the contribution to @xmath41 (= _ c_/_t _ ) of this electron fs .",
    "using isotropic three - dimensional effective - mass approximation , @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here , @xmath45 is the fermi energy , @xmath46 the fermi wave number , @xmath47 unit volume , and other symbols as usual . assuming _",
    "n _ to be 10@xmath6 electron / ce and @xmath32 to be 10 - 20 @xmath35 , we have @xmath45 of 26 - 13 k and @xmath41 of 1.5 - 3 mj / molk@xmath4 .",
    "the estimated @xmath41 is one order - of - magnitude smaller than the experimental value of 40 mj / molk@xmath4.@xcite    having discussed the experimental estimations of the carrier number and @xmath41 , we here compare the two theoretical models of cenisn .",
    "the considerable discrepancy between the estimated and measured @xmath41 values may be a support to the two - fluid model,@xcite since it claims that the specific heat is dominated by neutral spin excitations .",
    "however , it does not seem to provide clear explanation for the largely reduced carrier number . on the other hand , in the case of the anisotropic hybridization - gap model , small fs s",
    "are expected to appear around the nodes in the brillouin zone where the hybridization gap vanishes , if small dispersion of renormalized _",
    "f_-electron levels is taken into account.@xcite thus , the observation of the fs does not conflict with the model .",
    "the measured large @xmath41 may be accounted for if we assume that hole carriers have effective mass of @xmath0200 _ m_@xmath5 .",
    "this assumption is not so unlikely as it may , at first sight , appear .",
    "it is known that the many - body mass enhancement in ce - based heavy fermions varies from fs to fs and hence that light and heavy carriers often coexist in one compound .",
    "indeed , effective masses in ceru@xmath13si@xmath13 found by de haas - van alphen measurements range from @xmath01 _ m_@xmath5 to more than 100 _",
    "m_@xmath5.@xcite if _",
    "t_@xmath12 is a measure of possible mass enhancement factor , the existence of carriers with mass of @xmath0200 _ m_@xmath5 in cenisn can not be ruled out , since _",
    "t_@xmath12 is comparable in the two compounds .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath1 dependence of resistivity observed below 0.16 k [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ] . we attribute it to quasiparticle - quasiparticle collisions .",
    "namely , we regard it as a low - temperature limiting behavior of a fermi liquid .",
    "the two peculiarities in the _ t_@xmath4 dependence , i.e. , the relatively low @xmath24 and anomalously large _ a _ can not be taken as indications of exceptionally strong many - body effects in cenisn , but rather seem to be connected with the extremely low carrier concentration of 10@xmath6 electron / ce .",
    "the fermi energy of the electron carriers is estimated to be @xmath020 k as described above , while that of the hole carriers could be one order - of - magnitude smaller because of the larger mass .",
    "the suppression of @xmath24 probably relates to these fine energy scales .",
    "the huge @xmath48 does not conform to the kadowaki - woods relation , _",

    "this is , however , not the case with cenisn , in which the formation of the pseudogap suppresses @xmath41 , while it enhances resistivity through reduced carrier number .",
    "thus the anomalously large _ a _ can be qualitatively explained .",
    "one might argue that electron - phonon scattering could also lead to @xmath1 behavior in semimetals .",
    "for example , the resistivity of bismuth varies as @xmath1 between 0.3 and 1 k.@xcite the essence of the electron - phonon scenario of the @xmath1 resistivity is that , if the fs is small and anisotropic , large - angle scattering ( i.e. , scattering angle @xmath0 180@xmath21 ) by phonons may survive down to very low temperatures:@xcite at a low temperature _",
    "t _ , most of excited phonons have wave numbers smaller than @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a sound velocity",
    ". if a minimal caliper of a fs is smaller than @xmath52 , appreciable large - angle scattering can still occur and the temperature dependence of resistivity remains weaker than @xmath53 that is expected from the bloch - grneisen law.@xcite specifically , in the case of a cylindrical fs , it can be shown that the resistivity exhibits @xmath1 dependence in an extended temperature range before the @xmath53 dependence appears.@xcite this scenario , however , does not apply to cenisn .",
    "the sound velocity in cenisn is @xmath54,@xcite yielding @xmath55 at @xmath56 , the lowest temperature of the measurements .",
    "the observed sdh frequencies , @xmath0100 t , correspond to a fs cross - section of @xmath57 . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume the cross - section to be rectangular .",
    "the shorter sides of the rectangle must be comparable to @xmath52 so that large - angle scattering can be effective .",
    "accordingly , the longer sides will be @xmath58 .",
    "such extremely anisotropic fs ( aspect ratio @xmath37 10@xmath59 ) can never be compatible with the anisotropy in the resistivity : the ratio of the resistivities along the most resistive _ c _ and least resistive _ a _ axes is @xmath04 at most.@xcite",
    "lastly , we discuss magnetic - field effects on the electronic structure .",
    "the negative magnetoresistance and nonlinear hall resistivity for _ b _ @xmath23 _ a _ [ figs .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) and ( e ) ] suggest that the electronic structure changes with the field , as was previously pointed out.@xcite although the magnetoresistance maximum and bend ( or dip ) can not necessarily be identified with phase transitions , it seems reasonable to regard them as characteristic fields of the field - induced change .",
    "the magnetoresistance maximum probably signals the onset of substantial changes .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that the hall resistivity for _ b _ @xmath23 _ c _ deviates from nearly linear field dependence , i.e. , normal behavior , at the field of the magnetoresistance maximum . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear what underlies the bend ( or dip ) .",
    "these characteristic fields increase as the field is tilted away from the _ a _ axis .",
    "this may be related to that the magnetic susceptibilities along the _ b _ and _ c _ axes are less than half of that along the _ a _",
    "axis.@xcite    the sudden appearance of the high - frequency oscillations above the magnetoresistance dip ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) suggests that a larger fs appears at high fields as a result of the changes in the electronic structure .",
    "the quasiparticle mass associated with the high frequency is no smaller than those found for the low - frequency branch .",
    "these are basically consistent with that @xmath41 is enhanced in fields along the _ a _ axis.@xcite the variation of @xmath41 is gradual and featureless , compared to the sudden appearance of the high frequency oscillation .",
    "the discrepancy could be ascribed to the difference in the field direction and/or the fact that @xmath41 was measured on an early semiconducting sample ( ref .  ) or at a much higher temperature of 3.3 k.@xcite",
    "we have established that a small number of intrinsic charge carriers with enhanced mass do exist in the ground state of cenisn .",
    "the carrier concentration is estimated to be @xmath60 electron / ce , while the quasiparticle mass is @xmath010 - 20 @xmath35 .",
    "combining these two parameters , we have estimated the contribution of the observed fs to @xmath41 to be a few mj / molk@xmath4 , which is one order - of - magnitude smaller than the experimental @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the essential question raised by the two - fluid model still remains to be solved ; whether or not neutral spin excitations , besides charge carriers , are necessary to explain low - temperature thermodynamic properties in cenisn .",
    "the resistivity exhibits @xmath1-dependence below @xmath61 . viewing this dependence as a fermi - liquid behavior",

    "we note that the zeeman energy at 20 t is @xmath020 k for a moment of @xmath01 @xmath2@xmath62 and is comparable to ( or much larger than ) the fermi energy of the electron ( hole ) carriers derived in the present work .",
