    "black holes through quantum outcome indicate that they radiate due to the hawking effect @xcite . in the absence of established theories of quantum gravity ,",
    "black holes have become a main playground to divulge quantum gravity effects through their thermodynamics .",
    "black holes have been used as theorists laboratories in many other relevant fields .",
    "thermodynamic properties of black holes have been studied for many years , but established statistical explanations of black hole thermodynamics are still lacking .",
    "it shows that black holes also have the standard thermodynamic quantities , such as temperature , entropy and heat capacity and so on , and even possess abundant phase structures like the hawking - page phase transition @xcite and similar critical phenomena in ordinary thermodynamic systems .",
    "recent years witness the renewed interest towards the study of black hole solutions specially in modified theories of gravity @xcite , as besides theoretical results , cosmological evidence , e.g. dark matter and dark energy , suggests possibility of changing the einstein gravity . on the other hand ,",
    "the einstein gravity can not be quantized ( non - renormalizable ) , so it is believed that it is a low energy effective theory and could be modified with higher derivative terms at high energy @xcite .",
    "modifications to the einstein gravity theory , for instance the lovelock theory @xcite , the @xmath1 gravity theory @xcite , etc . have been studied extensively .",
    "those models in higher spacetime dimensions have very different features .",
    "for example , nature of stability in higher dimensions is quite different . extending spacetime dimensionality in gravity theories",
    "has been one possible way to combine other interactions with gravity or often seems to be even required in many theories , e.g. kaluza - klein theory , a string theory , brane world scenarios , etc . @xcite .    in these context , apart from the standard einstein - hilbert action , there also exist interesting theories of gravity in dimensions greater than four involving higher powers of the curvatures such that the field equations for the metric are at most in second - order . among the higher curvature gravity theories ,",
    "the most extensively studied theory is the so - called lovelock gravity @xcite , which naturally emerges when we wish to generalize the einstein theory in higher dimensions by keeping all characteristics of usual general relativity excepting the linear dependence of the riemann tensor .",
    "the lovelock gravity is one of the most general second order theories in higher dimensions , which is free from ghosts",
    ". the lovelock theory may play an important role in a string theory where the low energy effective field theory of gravity contains higher curvature terms .    in this sense",
    "the lovelock gravity @xcite is a natural extension to the einstein gravity .",
    "it is constructed by sum of all the euler densities of a @xmath2-dimensional manifold .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 a spacetime dimension @xmath5 can be written as @xmath6 for even dimensions and @xmath7 for odd dimensions .",
    "the @xmath8th order higher derivative terms @xmath9 become a surface term when @xmath10 .",
    "non - trivial extra terms contribute to equations of motion in higher dimensions but not in dimensions less than @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , higher derivative terms can cancel a ghost term .",
    "for instance , the reference @xcite shows that the second order lovelock ( gauss - bonnet ) terms cancel a ghost term .",
    "boulware and deser @xcite first found a static , spherically symmetric black hole solution with the gauss - bonnet corrections . using the gauss - bonnet gravity static , spherically symmetric solutions are obtained later @xcite with thermodynamic properties @xcite .",
    "static , spherically symmetric black hole solutions in the lovelock gravity with general energy momentum tensors in any arbitrary dimension can be found in @xcite and @xcite and its thermodynamics in @xcite .",
    "further extensive studies on the gauss - bonnet black holes with a focus on thermodynamic properties have been found in @xcite .",
    "the special third order lovelock gravity also received a significant attention , e.g. for a black hole solution and its thermodynamics in this theory with born - infield source @xcite and for a causality violation @xcite .",
    "also , topological properties of the general lovelock black holes in the context of thermodynamics have been investigated @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we begin with finding static , spherically symmetric black hole solutions for a string cloud background for a specific case , i.e. , @xmath11 and examine thermodynamic properties in the third order lovelock gravity .",
    "the solution in there can be utilized to calculate mass , temperature , entropy and heat capacity of black holes and explicitly study effects of a string cloud background .",
    "it turns out that the horizon and thermodynamic properties of lovelock black hole in conjunction with a string parameter could have some interesting features .",
    "it may be pointed out that gravity coupled to clouds of strings may be very useful and important as the universe can be considered as a collection of extended objects , like , one dimensional strings .",
    "the study of black holes in a cloud of strings was initiated by letelier modifying the schwarzschild solutions for a cloud of strings as a source @xcite , which was recently extended to the gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite and also to the lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "we show that a string cloud background makes a profound influence on horizon structures and thermodynamic quantities but entropy is not changed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ lovelock action and equations of motion ] we begin examining the third order lovelock action , which is a modification of the einstein - hilbert action , and also derive energy momentum tensors of a cloud of strings .",

    "[ conclusion ] , which gives concluding remarks .",
    "we have used units that fix @xmath12 and the metric signature , @xmath13 .",
    "the lovelock theory is the most general theory of gravity that gives second order field equations in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the recent interest in the lovelock theory arose because its action appears as a low energy limit of a heterotic superstring theory .",
    "the simplest third order lovelock action reads @xcite : @xmath14 + \\mathcal{i}_{s } \\label{ig}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a matter action due to cloud of strings .",
    "the einstein term @xmath16 is @xmath17 , the second order lovelock ( gauss - bonnet ) term @xmath18 is @xmath19 and the third order lovelock lagrangian is @xmath20 here @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the ricci scalar , the riemann and the ricci tensors , respectively .",

    "the variation of the action with respect to the metric @xmath28 yields modified field equations for the third order lovelock gravity , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the einstein tensor , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given explicitly in @xcite , respectively : @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the energy momentum tensor of a matter field which we consider here as clouds of strings .",
    "note that for the third order lovelock gravity , the non - trivial third terms require a spacetime dimension @xmath5 to satisfy @xmath36 .",
    "next we turn attention to calculate the energy - momentum tensor of a cloud of strings ( see @xcite , for further details ) .",

    "further , since @xmath49 , then the energy - momentum tensor for one string reads @xmath50 hence , a cloud of strings has the energy - momentum tensor @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a proper density of a cloud of strings .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 is a gauge - invariant density .",
    "as will be seen in next discussions the presence of a string cloud plays a main role in the horizon structure of the theory together with other parameters . for instance , a string cloud parameter @xmath54 can change the number of horizons and singularities and make singularity covered by a horizon with fixed other parameters .",
    "given parameters @xmath55 a positive mass condition imposes either mass bound or range of the horizon radius .",
    "rich analysis along this line for absence of energy momentum tensor has been made in @xcite .",
    "vanishing string cloud is a transition point for singularities to be created @xmath56 and one for the number of horizons for @xmath57 . in general",
    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath58 is expressed for static spherically symmetric spacetime , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a constant , @xcite .",
    "the dominant energy condition allows only @xmath61 and @xmath62 and the causality condition further constrains @xmath60 to @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic quantities are determined by mass expression , which is given for the lovelock theory in terms of a horizon radius @xmath64 by @xmath65 where @xmath66 $ ] and the curvature constant @xmath67 , @xcite .",
    "the mass for a string cloud is @xmath68 as noticed the a string cloud contributes to the mass with the highest possible power of @xmath64 , i.e. the energy condition upper bound @xmath69 but violates causality . for even dimensions the presence of a string cloud effectively changes the highest coupling @xmath70 , @xmath71 while for odd dimensions it is a unique source term thermodynamically , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we take a string cloud only as a classical background .",
    "the reference @xcite claims that causality violation in the third order lovelock theory can be fixed by adding an infinite tower of massive higher spin particles .",
    "unless we look for dynamics instead of static background of strings , it is not certain how a string cloud contributes to the causality problem .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to study whether causality violation in classical sense can be weaken or removed when the external massive particles are combined with a string cloud into a background .",
    "here we wish to obtain static , spherically symmetric black hole solutions to eq .",

    "<S> we present an exact static , spherically symmetric black hole solution to the third order lovelock gravity with a string cloud background in seven dimensions for the special case when the second and third order lovelock coefficients are related via @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> further , we examine thermodynamic properties of this black hole to obtain exact expressions for mass , temperature , entropy and also perform the thermodynamic stability analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we see that a string cloud background makes a profound influence on horizon structure , thermodynamic properties and the stability of black holes . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly the entropy of the black hole is unaffected due to a string cloud background . </S>",
    "<S> however , the critical solution for thermodynamic stability is being affected by a string cloud background . </S>"
