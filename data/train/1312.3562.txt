    "parity non - conservation ( pnc ) is a unique signature of the weak interaction .",
    "thanks to this property it is possible to study the weak interaction in the presence of other , dominating interactions like the electromagnetic one . shortly after the discovery of pnc , the possibility of observing it in atomic systems , due to the possible existence of a neutral weak current , was considered @xcite .",
    "we have initiated a program , at the francium trapping facility ( ftf ) at isac / triumf , to study weak interaction physics at low energy through atomic parity non - conservation ( apnc ) @xcite in neutral francium ( fr ) atoms .",
    "the scarcity of the unstable atoms can be compensated for by the techniques of laser cooling and trapping applied to radioactive atoms @xcite that allow for long - term interrogation of the atoms under well - controlled conditions .",
    "the apnc measurements rely on two aspects ; first , an apparatus with a well - defined handedness , and second , the interference between a weak - interaction - induced transition and an electromagnetically allowed transition .",
    "the control of the environment and the apparatus require careful planning at all stages , in particular since the measurement takes place in an accelerator hall , where changing magnetic fields and large rf electromagnetic fields can introduce noise and systematic effects .",
    "the program requires a reliable laser cooling and trapping apparatus that efficiently uses the radioactive ions . while the accelerator delivers fast ions to our facility ,",
    "the planned experiments require slow neutral atoms .",
    "our apnc apparatus consists of two parts , the capture assembly and the science chamber .",
    "the first step in the manipulation of francium is to accumulate the francium ions on an yttrium foil .",
    "the francium is released in atomic form ( because of the lower work function of yttrium with respect to francium @xcite ) by resistive heating of the foil , and it is trapped in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "all of this happens in the capture assembly .",
    "briefly , a mot uses a combination of near - resonant laser light ( red - detuned from resonance by @xmath4 ) with a three - dimensional magnetic field gradient to produce a force that is both velocity - dependent ( dissipative ) and position - dependent ( restorative ) to cool and capture neutral atoms that are moving at velocities lower than a capture velocity , @xmath5 ( about @xmath6 m/s ) @xcite .",
    "once trapped , the atoms can be probed in the capture assembly or transported to the science chamber for the actual apnc measurements in a well - controlled environment .",
    "this paper reports the successful commissioning of the ftf at the isac facility of triumf ; we focus on the capture assembly , as the science chamber was not constructed yet at the time of the commissioning run .",
    "section  [ sec - weak ] briefly reviews the physics of apnc , followed by the requirements for the measurements and facility in section  [ sec : requirements ] .",
    "the production and delivery of francium into the ftf is presented in section  [ sec : production_delivery ] , while an overview of the ftf is given in section  [ sec : ftf ] .",
    "brief results from measurements with rubidium are presented in section  [ sec : rubidium ] .",
    "section  [ sec : commissioning ] summarizes the results from the on - line commissioning run .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions_outlook ] gives conclusions for the described work and an outlook .",
    "atomic parity non - conservation arises from the parity - violating exchange of @xmath7 bosons between the atomic constituents , leading to a mixing of atomic levels of opposite parity @xcite . as a result , otherwise parity - forbidden electric - dipole transitions can be excited between states of the same parity .",
    "several processes lead to apnc .",
    "if the nucleons and electrons are described as as a vector and an axial vector current respectively this leads to nuclear spin - independent apnc ( _ nsi_-apnc ) .",
    "nuclear spin - dependent apnc ( _ nsd_-apnc ) occurs in three ways @xcite ; ( i ) an electron interacting weakly with a single valence nucleon ( nucleon axial - vector current and electron vector current ) , ( ii ) an electron experiencing an electromagnetic interaction with a nuclear chiral current created by parity - violating weak interactions between nucleons ( anapole moment ) @xcite , and ( iii ) the combined action of the hyperfine interaction and the nuclear spin - independent @xmath7 exchange interaction from nucleon vector currents @xcite . in heavy atoms , process ii )",
    "is the dominant source of _",
    "nsd_-apnc @xcite .",
    "the frpnc collaboration is working towards measurements of both types of pnc effects @xcite .",
    "the attractiveness of fr for _ nsi_-apnc experiments has been discussed since the early 1990s in the context of searches for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "the atomic theory and structure of fr ( z = 87 ) can be understood at a level similar to that of cs ( z = 55 ) , where the most precise measurement to date has been performed @xcite , yet the apnc effect has been calculated to be 18 times larger @xcite .",
    "all recent and on - going experiments in atomic pnc rely on the large enhancement of the effect in heavy nuclei ( large @xmath8 ) , first pointed out by the bouchiats @xcite . the weak interaction transition amplitudes are exceedingly small , and an interference method is commonly used to measure them .",
    "a typical experiment measures a quantity that has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the parity - conserving ( typically much larger ) and parity non - conserving amplitudes respectively .",
    "the second term on the right side corresponds to the interference term , which can experimentally be isolated because it changes sign under a parity transformation .",
    "our strategy for apnc in fr is to measure the excitation rate of a highly forbidden transition inside a handed apparatus ( see the review by the bouchiats @xcite ) . for the case of _ nsi_-apnc it will be the electric dipole transition between the @xmath12 and @xmath13 levels in fr that becomes allowed through the weak interaction .",
    "interference between this transition and the one induced by the stark effect due to the presence of a static electric field generates a signal proportional to the weak charge .",
    "we follow a strategy similar to the cs apnc measurement that reached a precision of 0.35% @xcite on the _ nsi_-apnc . for the case of",
    "_ nsd_-apnc it will be the electric dipole transition between hyperfine levels in the @xmath12 ground state interfering with the allowed magnetic dipole transition to produce a signal proportional to the anapole moment . in refs .",
    "@xcite they also obtained the first definite measurement of an anapole moment with an accuracy of 14% by comparing signals from different hyperfine levels .",
    "the successful extraction of weak interaction physics from the measured atomic quantities requires a detailed quantitative understanding of the atomic wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "an apnc measurement will generally proceed as follows ; we trap and cool atoms on - line at the ftf . the cold francium sample",
    "is then transferred to a science chamber with precise control of all electric , magnetic , and electromagnetic fields , as well as better vacuum ( @xmath14 mbar ) , where the handed experiments to study apnc take place .",
    "we require probing of large numbers of atoms in order to obtain a good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "our preliminary calculations show that @xmath15 to @xmath16 trapped atoms at a temperature below @xmath17mk should be sufficient .",
    "reference  @xcite has a detailed study of all the necessary requirements for the measurement of @xmath18-apnc in fr .",
    "the environmental requirements are similar for the @xmath19-apnc measurement . the isac - i hall at triumf , where our experiment resides , has several linear accelerators , or linacs",
    "( see for example the beamline denoted rfq in figure  [ fig : plan]a ) , that produce ample radio - frequency ( rf ) electromagnetic fields that can interfere with our measurements .",
    "the complete ftf is therefore located inside a faraday cage .          the background rf noise at the location of the ftf without the faraday cage was 21 v / m at 35 mhz and 2.7 v / m at 106 mhz , the most relevant frequencies from the rfq of the linac on the west side of the ftf ( see figure  [ fig : plan]a ) .",
    "the dimensions of the faraday cage are @xmath20m@xmath21 under the existing platform that houses the titan facility .",
    "there is a column that supports the titan facility so the shielding of the room has to cover the column appropriately .",
    "universal shielding corporation designed and constructed a galvanized steel faraday cage to be the laboratory of the ftf .",
    "the floor , ceiling , and walls are made of metal - covered wood composite , with the appropriate fire retardants .",
    "the doors required double sets of grounding strips to ensure no rf leakage into the room .",
    "the room has penetrations with rf filters to allow water , air , the beamline , telephone , ethernet , and other signals and services to enter the room . when the room is properly closed , the faraday cage attenuates the rf amplitude by more than 100 db at @xmath22mhz to levels lower than the noise floor of our measuring instrument .",
    "the requirements on the room temperature are a range of 22 - 24 @xmath23c and a stability better than @xmath241.0 @xmath23c or better ( year round , minute - to - minute )",
    ". the relative humidity must be stable to @xmath25% .",
    "the temperature and relative humidity of the isac area of triumf show short - term fluctuations of @xmath26c and @xmath24 15% , respectively , while the long - term ones are season - dependent .",
    "most of the equipment in the ftf requires this level of environmental stability , in particular the lasers and their locking systems @xcite .",
    "a few of the systems have extra temperature control as their stability should be better than @xmath27c .",
    "the temperature and humidity stabilization is realized by an hvac system .",
    "the applied magnetic fields at the center of the science chamber need a fractional control at the @xmath28 level @xcite , with applied fields of the order of a few gauss initially . during the summer of 2012 , with most of the trapping apparatus ( capture assembly )",
    "assembled and working , we studied the magnetic field environment of the ftf and measured the spectral density of the magnetic field noise .",
    "we measured the magnetic field with a honeywell hmc1002 anisotropic magneto - resistive ( amr ) sensor , which has a precision of 100 @xmath29 g , with a 10 hz bandwidth and a range of @xmath242 g. the magnetic noise at the experiment is dominated by line noise at 60 hz and 180 hz at the mg level that can be controlled with feedback and feedforward .",
    "the magnetic field caused by the triumf cyclotron at the location of the ftf is of the same order as the magnetic field of the earth , @xmath30 g . above",
    "the ftf sits the titan facility with superconducting magnets for their penning traps .",
    "their influence at the mot is also of the order of the magnetic field of the earth , and since the magnets operate in steady state , it is possible to correct for the dc fields with appropriate pairs of coils surrounding the apparatus .",
    "measurements before the fall of 2011 at the current location of the ftf indicated that the dc magnetic field varies on the order of @xmath31 mg over the course of several days . while we will not shield the entire room against quasi - static magnetic fields , active control at the science chamber will be necessary to maintain a highly - stable magnetic field environment for precision apnc measurements .",
    "the overall design of the ftf incorporates a number of radiation safety features .",
    "radiation safety is an important consideration for experiments at triumf and also a part of standard engineering practices .",
    "we briefly describe these standard nuclear physics engineering steps and procedures in the context of francium trapping , since they are not usually encountered in atomic physics experiments .",
    "the ftf is equipped to handle the short - term radiation present during delivery and trapping of francium and also the long - term radiation hazards posed by the francium decay products inside the vacuum system . at present , the radiation levels during francium delivery and trapping are sufficiently low ( @xmath32@xmath29sv / hr ) to permit in situ operation of the ftf by experimenters , though the computer control of the apparatus can be used for future external control of the ftf if higher francium and radiation rates become necessary . the ftf room is designed for connection to isac s nuclear exhaust system in case of an accidental vacuum breach during a beamtime or a planned opening of the vacuum system .",
    "the turbomolecular pumps on the beamline are connected to this nuclear exhaust as well .",
    "several francium isotopes decay to long - lived isotopes .",
    "for example , @xmath33% of @xmath1fr , used during the commissioning run , decays into @xmath1po , which is an @xmath34 emitter with a half - life of @xmath35years .",
    "handling components that are contaminated with these isotopes requires special care as the @xmath34 radiation is hard to detect and is very damaging to biological tissue when inhaled or ingested ( compared to @xmath36 or @xmath37 radiation ) .",
    "the vacuum system components , in particular the neutralizer chamber ( see section  [ sec : neutralizer_chamber ] ) , have been designed for rapid swap - out in order to minimize exposure to these isotopes .    during the run ,",
    "spikes in the radiation levels were detected by @xmath37 monitors close to the roughing lines of the turbomolecular pumps .",
    "the spikes ( @xmath38@xmath29sv / hr ) coincided with the heating of the yttrium foil and indicate that significant amounts of activity are pumped out of the vacuum system into the nuclear exhaust .",
    "after opening the system , we detected , by @xmath37 counting , a relatively large amount of @xmath1po in the yttrium foil ( corresponding to @xmath39% of delivered francium ) and a small amount in the glass cell ( where only upper limits could be set ) .",
    "the reason for the activity in the yttrium foil is that not all francium atoms are released from it during heating , see section  [ sec : efficiency ] .",
    "[ sec : production_delivery ]    in this section we briefly describe the production of the francium ions , and their transport to the ftf .",
    "a proton beam from the triumf cyclotron with an energy of @xmath40mev impinges on a target and produces a number of neutron - rich and neutron - deficient fr isotopes",
    ". the proton current can be as high as @xmath41@xmath29a for uc@xmath42 targets.these isotopes originate from the interaction of the protons with a hot uc@xmath42 target made of many thin wafers of the material ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for information about isac .",
    "the produced fr isotopes are surface - ionized in a hot transfer tube , pass through a mass separator that selects a single nuclear mass and are guided through isac s low - energy beamline .",
    "the production yields of about @xmath43 fr / s demonstrated in december 2010 for several francium isotopes have been increased during the two beamtimes in 2012 .",
    "although isobaric contaminants may be delivered to the experiment , these unwanted atoms are not trapped , since the mot employs narrow isomer - specific optical transitions .",

    "all the focusing and steering elements of the beamline that deliver fr@xmath44 onto the yttrium neutralizer foil ( see section  [ sec : neutralizer_chamber ] ) are electrostatic for mass - independent ion transport .",
    "we have the possibility to use the same beamline to feed in stable isotopes such as rb@xmath45 from a commercial ion source ( kimball physics ilg-6 ) to align and test the full system .",
    "four steerer plates and two einzel lenses control the ion beam from isac to the neutralizer chamber with the yttrium foil .",
    "furthermore , the 4-sector x - y steerer plates can be independently controlled to add a quadrupole singlet to optimize the final tune after the astigmatic isac beam transport design @xcite . for a @xmath46kev beam ,",
    "the voltages on the einzel lenses are of the order of @xmath47 kv , while the voltages on the steering plates are between @xmath48 and @xmath49v .",
    "we ran a test in january 2012 with a stable @xmath50o@xmath44 ion beam from isac at @xmath46kev which is similar to the energy used for fr@xmath44 .",
    "we delivered @xmath51% of the beam in a location about 20 cm before the neutralizer foil  before the capture assembly was installed  through a 6 mm aperture .",

    "the first section of the ftf beamline is pumped by two @xmath54l / s turbomolecular pumps ( varian turbo - v 551 navigator ) , which are located outside of the faraday cage .",

    "some of the most important components of the facility will be described in this section ; the capture assembly for trapping the francium ions into a mot , the associated lasers , and the control and acquisition software .",
    "the capture assembly is connected to the beamline and sits about @xmath62 m above the floor .",
    "it consists of three main parts : the neutralizer , the glass cell for the mot , and the diagnostics with a faraday cup and @xmath34 detector ( figure  [ fig : mot_sketch ] ) .",
    "a stainless steel chamber ( kimball physics ) houses the collimator and the dual - position neutralizer .",
    "the collimating aperture of @xmath60 mm diameter ( not shown in figure  [ fig : mot_sketch ] ) is held on a groove grabber ( kimball physics ) at the entrance of the chamber and is used for tuning the isac ion beam .",
    "the high - efficiency neutralization and capture scheme developed at stony brook @xcite has been used as a starting point for the design of the y neutralizer .",
    "there are two important improvements on the previous design .",
    "all related parts are mounted on one 4.5-inch conflat ( cf ) flange and attached on one side , as to mitigate possible safety concerns related to the decay products of francium if we have to replace the neutralizer .",
    "the current to the yttrium foil is now delivered by fixed contacts instead of the continuous wire used before that was the dominant failure mode ( when breaking ) in the previous design .",
    "the design allows for the atoms to be transferred from the capture mot to the science chamber below .",
    "ions impinge on the yttrium neutralizer .",
    "after accumulation , the foil is rotated and heated to release the francium atoms into the glass cell where they are trapped in the mot .",
    "when the foil is in the upper position , the francium ions impinge on the beam diagnostics system at the end of the beamline . ]",
    "the ion beam is focused on the y foil ( with a thickness of @xmath63@xmath29 m ) in the catching position ( see figure  [ fig : mot_sketch ] and figure  [ fig : alpha_det]a ) . after accumulating the radioactive ions ( for about @xmath46s ) the neutralizer holder rotates to its delivery position and a current runs through the thin foil raising its temperature to not more than @xmath64c by running a current of about @xmath65a .",
    "the chamber has a window mounted on one of the mini - cf ports at the top of the chamber that allows observation of the neutralizer holder to measure the temperature using a pyrometer and ensure its proper rotation .",

    "the ta foil and its mount can be removed simply by taking the flange out .",
    "a combination of two pumps maintain the vacuum in the chamber : a 20 l / s ion pump ( duniway ) and an ion - getter pump ( nextorr by saes ) , that has 100 l / s pumping speed for hydrogen .",
    "we are in the process of adding hardware interlocks that will monitor the position of the neutralizer holder and the ta foil and the intensity and duration of the current pulse applied to the y foil so as to prevent damage to the foil .",
    "the interlocks will not require software control and they will default to a safe state in case of a power or hardware failure .     detector assembly . ]",
    "the atom trap itself is situated in a glass cell with a silane - based dry - film coating to avoid sticking of the fr atoms to the walls , while providing many atom - wall interactions that re - thermalize the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the atoms at each ` bounce ' .",
    "these numerous ` bounces ' provide multiple opportunities to capture the atoms in the mot @xcite .",
    "we follow a procedure based on ref .  @xcite using the silane - based compound sc-77 , with modifications established by trial - and - error over the years .",
    "the pulsed - mode operation of the trap has many benefits ; by keeping the trapping cell open most of the time , we ensure a good vacuum resulting in a long trap lifetime . closing the trap with the neutralizer delivers the neutral atoms into the trapping region and prevents them from escaping before they are trapped . having the yttrium cold most of the time reduces damage to the dry - film coating .",
    "finally , the francium is accumulated on the yttrium foil rather than in the mot , thus reducing losses . after collecting a laser - cooled sample , the atoms",
    "will then be transferred vertically down to a second chamber for the planned precision experiments .",

    "secondly , to lock the lasers during a run we use a scanning fabry - perot cavity , once the correct frequencies for trapping have been found @xcite . the cavity locking scheme is described in more detail in section  [ sec : cavity_lock ] as part of the software controls .      at the time of the commissioning run ,",
    "three main programs were available to run the experiment : a sequencer to control the experimental cycle ( section  [ sec : cycle_control ] ) , a program to acquire data from the various imaging systems ( section  [ sec : camera_control ] ) and a program to frequency - stabilize the lasers to the transfer cavity ( section  [ sec : cavity_lock ] ) .",

    "this program can operate the imi - tech and micropix cameras ; it can handle any firewire - compatible camera .",
    "the roper scientific camera uses a program developed in our group based on labview drivers provided by the manufacturer .",
    "the absence of readily - available atomic references at the exact frequencies necessary for the francium trapping requires the use of a transfer lock technique .",
    "we have implemented , based on previous work in ref .",
    "@xcite a way to transfer the frequency stability of a hene laser ( melles - griot 05-stp-901 ) to other lasers using a scanning , confocal fabry - perot interferometer .",
    "the free spectral range of the cavity is @xmath84mhz with a finesse of @xmath31 at @xmath77 nm .",
    "analog input and output is controlled by two national instruments cards ( pci-6221 and pci-6713 ) .",
    "the program sends a voltage ramp to a voltage amplifier ( exfo rg-91 ) , which is then sent to one ( or both ) piezo crystal(s ) of the cavity assembly .",
    "light from the hene and the lasers requiring stabilization will be transmitted through the cavity at specific voltages of the ramp .",
    "after the cavity the light from each laser is separated either by frequency using dichroic filters or by polarizing beam splitters , and is detected by photodiodes .",
    "the photodiode signals are acquired in synchronization with the voltage ramp and the relative frequency of the lasers with respect to the hene peaks is kept constant using a software - based pid feedback algorithm . at the time of the commissioning run everything was set up to stabilize four lasers .",
    "the feedback bandwidth is of the order of @xmath46hz , dominated by the voltage ramp ( @xmath85ms ) duration , with only a small computational overhead .",
    "the stability of the lock is of the order of @xmath25mhz over a few days .",
    "this is mainly limited by ( i ) the frequency stability of the hene , ( ii ) non - linearities in the expansion of the piezo crystals with respect to the applied voltage , and ( iii ) changes of atmospheric conditions , thus influencing the optical length of the cavity by changes of the refractive index of air between the mirrors .",
    "the last factor has been corrected recently by operating the transfer cavity under vacuum .",
    "testing the trapping apparatus with stable rb has been crucial for understanding its performance .",
    "these tests allow us to verify the proper working of the mot , and to align all the cameras and detectors .",
    "the exoskeleton provides good alignment of the mot beams , but cameras ( or probe beams for future measurements ) are installed independently of it .",
    "an important test is to ensure that the zero of the magnetic field and the location of the trap coincide as much as possible .",
    "we have found that the fr trap can appear slightly off from the rb trap , but not more than two mm .    in the future , as the sequences for the experiment become more complicated , tests with stable rb will become more and more important .",
    "they are useful to verify measurement schemes and to quantify systematic effects without using radioactive beamtime .",
    "we installed a kimball ilg-6 rb@xmath44 source for delivering an off - line ion beam to test the ion optics and the neutralizer .",
    "a removable electrostatic mirror deflects the rb@xmath86 beam towards the neutralizer .",
    "however , when sending an ion beam across , we found that its contribution to the atoms trapped is indistinguishable from that coming from the neutral gas background introduced by the ion source .",
    "the distance between the ion source and the neutralizer is less than @xmath31 cm , while at stony brook the distance to the rb source that produced the ions was closer to @xmath41meters and included a few stages of differential pumping .",
    "there is no plan to remedy this issue , because the beam optics have been tested sufficiently in the meantime and the neutralizer scheme is working reliably .",
    "we had five twelve - hour shifts between september 2nd and 5th , 2012 for commissioning .",
    "the isotope of choice for the test was @xmath1fr , as the wavelengths of the lasers necessary for trapping that isotope are well known from previous work at stony brook @xcite , it is produced at relatively high rates ( @xmath87 fr / s ) , and it minimizes long - lived @xmath34-emitting progeny .",
    "isac delivered @xmath88@xmath89 fr@xmath44 to the neutralizer , depending on attenuators inserted in the early stages of the beam transport .",
    "we monitor the activity by looking at the @xmath34-decay of the atoms on the si detector next to the faraday cup .",
    "table [ trap_parameters ] summarizes the parameters of the trap .",
    "three of them have not been optimized yet ; the laser power and stability , and the y foil temperature .",
    "the latter was heated conservatively during commissioning .",
    ".operating parameters for the september 2012 commissioning run . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ isotope_parameters ]    the frequencies for @xmath1fr ( see table  [ isotope_parameters ] ) agree with our previous work and with the work of the legnaro group @xcite .",
    "the frequencies for @xmath2fr agree with the trapping done by the boulder group @xcite .",
    "the stability of the cavity while switching between isotopes enables us to measure isotope shifts with good accuracy using electro - optical modulator ( eom ) sideband optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we have successfully trapped up to @xmath3 @xmath1fr atoms at the ftf .",
    "this gives an efficiency of about 0.05% , which we calculate by taking the peak number of atoms in the trap and dividing it by the incoming francium beam integrated over the accumulation time .",
    "fig  [ fig : trap_lifetime]b ) shows the decay of a @xmath1fr trap that is not refilled ; the lifetime of @xmath46s is the result of having good vacuum of the order of @xmath90 mbar .",
    "we found , however , that , despite several stages of differential pumping in our beamline , the isac low - energy beamlines were still influencing our trap lifetime depending on changes in environmental temperature ( and thus water vapor pressure ) .",
    "the reason for the difference of more than a factor of 20 from the best efficiency achieved at stony brook @xcite comes from three main factors : limited laser power , imperfect neutralizer heating , and the suspected low performance of the dryfilm coating .",
    "the laser power available for trapping can be trivially increased .",
    "our new laser system ( m  squared solstis ) in combination with a high - power fiber will provide five times more intensity ; i.e. from @xmath91mw going into the fiber to about @xmath17w .",
    "the efficiency from this upgrade is expected to increase by a factor of @xmath6 ; the laser light can be red - detuned further from resonance while maintaining the same photon scattering rate , and as a result the capture velocity , @xmath5 , is increased @xcite . from measurements of the release of francium",
    "after the ion beam was turned off , we can deduce that about @xmath41% of francium atoms available in the yttrium foil were released on each heating cycle",
    ". this could be improved by a factor of @xmath71 by heating the neutralizer more homogeneously to higher temperature to reach @xmath92% @xcite .",
    "taking these two improvements into account , an efficiency of @xmath69@xmath93% becomes possible .",
    "the ftf is operating well .",
    "we have trapped up to @xmath3 @xmath1fr atoms , which corresponds to an efficiency of @xmath94% . the vacuum allows to have long trap lifetimes of about @xmath46s .",
    "we are in the process of designing and constructing the science chamber and have identified the issues that need improving on the capture assembly .",
    "they include a new y foil for neutralization with better electrical contact for more uniform heating , a new laser ( m squared solstis ) in combination with a high - power fiber that delivers more trapping light .",
    "we expect a transfer efficiency to the science chamber in fr similar or better to the one reached with rb ( @xmath92% ) since fr is heavier and has less transverse expansion .",
    "the goal of @xmath88 atoms in the science chamber for the weak interaction measurements @xcite is within reach for our system .",
