    "data for cuprate high - temperature superconductivity ( sc ) suggests @xmath3-wave singlet pairing in the superconducting state and that superconductivity in these systems is closely related to the antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator properties of the undoped compounds .",
    "this proximity of superconducting and antiferromagnetic order is unusual and suggests that a correct description of cuprate superconductors must permit the sc and af order to enter the theory on a similar footing .",
    "zhang et al @xcite proposed to unify af and sc states by assembling their order parameters into a 5-dimensional vector and constructing an @xmath1 group that rotates af order into @xmath3-wave sc order .",
    "recently , we introduced an @xmath0 model @xcite of high - temperature sc and af order having @xmath1 as a subgroup .",
    "the motivation for and methodology of the @xmath0 model are superficially rather different from those of zhang and collaborators",
    ". however , the appearance of the zhang @xmath1 as a subgroup of the @xmath0 symmetry implies that the two models must have a strong physical relationship , as we have already suggested @xcite .",
    "one difficulty in understanding this relationship is that the two models are formulated using different approaches that employ different languages . in the @xmath0 model",
    "the five operators responsible for af order ( three staggered magnetization operator components ) and sc order ( two @xmath3-wave pair operators ) enter the theory as quantum mechanical operators , on exactly the same footing as all of the other ten generators of @xmath0 @xcite . thus , the @xmath0 model is a many - body , fully quantum mechanical theory in which the charge and spin are exactly conserved , so there is no spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "this is , of course , as it should be : the charge and spin are rigorously conserved in a full many - body formulation of the problem as they are in nature . in the zhang @xmath1 model ,",
    "the five operators corresponding to the staggered magnetization and the @xmath3-wave singlet pairing are instead treated as order parameters ( expectation values of operators in a broken symmetry state ) .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath1 model the antiferromagnetic phase and the superconducting phase are associated with _",
    "approximate solutions _ of the many - body problem that break charge and spin symmetry spontaneously .",
    "the methodology employed in the development of the @xmath0 model ( systematic application of principles of dynamical symmetry ) has found broad application in other fields such as nuclear structure @xcite , molecular physics @xcite , or particle physics @xcite .",
    "this implies a deep algebraic connection between high temperature superconductivity and a variety of phenomena in other fields of physics that bear no superficial resemblance to high - temperature superconductors .",
    "for example , we have pointed out previously @xcite that there is an almost perfect mathematical analogy at the algebraic level between the af - sc competition in cuprates and the competition between quadrupole deformation of the nuclear mean field and nucleon pairing that is a central organizing principle of nuclear structure physics .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath1 subgroup in the dynamical symmetry of the @xmath0 model for high - temperature superconductors is very similar to that of the @xmath4 subgroup in the @xmath5 fermion dynamical symmetry model @xcite that describes nuclear structure .",
    "there is a well - developed theoretical approach to relating a many - body algebraic theory with no broken symmetry to an approximation of that theory that exhibits spontaneously broken symmetry : the method of generalized coherent states @xcite .",
    "this method may be viewed as the extension of glauber coherent state theory ( which is built on an @xmath6 lie algebra ) to a more complex system having an arbitrary lie algebra structure .",
    "it has also been shown to be equivalent to the most general hatree - fock - bogoliubov variational method under symmetry constraints , and has been applied extensively in various areas of physics and mathematical physics , though not to our knowledge in condensed matter .",
    "the result of such a coherent state analysis is a set of energy surfaces that represent an approximation to the original theory in which order parameters appear as independent variables . in the general case",
    ", these energy surfaces can exhibit ( possibly multiple ) minima and these minima may appear at non - zero values of the order parameters , implying spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , the generalized coherent state method is a systematic approach to relating a many - body algebraic theory to its approximate symmetric and broken symmetry solutions .      the concept of a _ critical dynamical symmetry",
    "_ appears naturally in applications of generalized coherent state techniques to other fields of physics .",
    "a critical dynamical symmetry is a dynamical symmetry having eigenstates that vary smoothly with a parameter ( usually particle - number related ) such that the eigenstates approximate one phase of the theory on one end of the parameter range and a different phase of the theory at the other end of the parameter range , with eigenstates in between exhibiting large softness against fluctuations in the order parameters describing the two phases .",
    "we shall demonstrate here what is , to our knowledge , the first example in condensed matter physics of such a symmetry . in this case",
    ", the critical dynamical symmetry will be shown to be based on the @xmath1 subgroup of @xmath0 , and it will be shown to interpolate between af and sc order as the hole doping parameter is varied .",
    "thus , we shall propose that , within the context of the more general @xmath0 model , the @xmath1 symmetry employed by zhang serves as a doorway between af and sc order in a manner that can be specified in precise terms using the language of lie algebras and generalized coherent state theory , and that is related to critical dynamical symmetries that have been found in other fields of physics .",
    "we shall use these results to derive a result that has received considerable attention for the @xmath1 model : that an exact @xmath1 symmetry can not account for the detailed phenomenology of the cuprate superconductors and that it is necessary to break @xmath1 ( explicitly , not spontaneously ) in a particular way in order to recover mott insulator normal states at half filling , as is required by the data . as we shall show , the embedding of @xmath1 as a subgroup of @xmath0 implies naturally that @xmath1 must be broken in this manner in order to produce the correct normal states at half filling .",
    "let us conclude this introduction by enumerating concisely the primary goals of this paper :    1 .",
    "this paper serves to introduce the generalized coherent state method to issues in condensed matter physics .",
    "we shall show how to relate the generalized coherent state to the most general variational quasiparticle states that can be constructed subject to the constraints of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this paper introduces into the high - temperature superconductor discussion in particular and condensed matter in general , the concepts of critical dynamical symmetries that have been applied with considerable success in other fields of physics .",
    "4 .   we shall demonstrate that the coherent state solution of the @xmath0 model identifies @xmath1 as a critical dynamical symmetry .",
    "this critical dynamical symmetry will be shown to interpolate between af and sc order as the hole doping of the system is varied .",
    "this doping dependence is a natural consequence of the @xmath0 symmetry , without the introduction of a chemical potential _",
    "ansatz_. 5 .",
    "we shall show that the af and sc phases themselves are more economically described , not by @xmath1 , but by dynamical symmetries built on @xmath7 and @xmath6 subgroups of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "thus , we shall demonstrate that @xmath0 accounts for both the origin of the af and sc order parameters and the @xmath1 `` rotation '' of the superspin vector between these phases .",
    "we shall demonstrate that as a fundamental consequence of the @xmath0 structure the @xmath1 subgroup _ must be broken _ in order to produce mott insulator normal states .",
    "furthermore , we shall demonstrate that the required symmetry breaking terms and the doping dependence of the solutions occur naturally within the @xmath0 parent algebra and need not be introduced by hand as is required in the zhang @xmath1 model .",
    "we shall show that , because of the nature of the critical dynamical symmetry , an af perturbed @xmath2 hamiltonian is able to approximate various symmetry limit solutions depending on the doping : the solutions are close to the @xmath7 limit presenting af order around half filling , and approach the @xmath6 limit presenting sc order as the hole doping increases .",
    "thus the @xmath0 model with a perturbed @xmath1 hamiltonian is able to account for the essential features of high @xmath8 superconductors",
    ".    our approach will be to introduce the basic features of the coherent state technique in sections ii and iii . in section",
    "iv we derive the coherent state energy surfaces for the @xmath0 model , and in section v we discuss the @xmath0 energy surfaces in various dynamical symmetry limits . in section",
    "vi , we use @xmath0 energy surfaces to examine the properties of broken @xmath1 symmetry , and then use these results in section vii to argue that with a small af - preferred symmetry breaking , an @xmath2 hamiltonian may be able to describe high temperature superconductivity .",
    "section viii presents a summary and conclusions .",
    "gilmore @xcite and perelomov @xcite ( see also earlier work by klauder @xcite ) demonstrated that glauber coherent states @xcite for the electromagnetic field could be generalized to define coherent states associated with the structure of an arbitrary lie group .",
    "in particular , they observed that the original glauber theory for coherent photon states may be expressed in terms of an @xmath6 lie algebra by examining the commutation properties of the second - quantized operators of the theory .",
    "once the theory has been formulated in terms of an @xmath6 algebra generated by combinations of creation and annihilation operators , the formalism may be generalized to encompass a set of such operators closed under any lie algebra .",
    "we shall term this extension of the glauber theory to arbitrary lie algebras the _ generalized coherent state method .",
    "_ since an extensive review concerning the basic approach has been presented in @xcite , we omit an introduction to the general technique and proceed directly to a specific application of the generalized coherent state method to the @xmath0 algebra .      a convenient way to analyze these generalized coherent states is in terms of their geometry , which is in one - to - one correspondence with the coset space .",
    "let us begin with the algebraic structure of the @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "we introduce 16 bilinear fermion operators : @xmath9 where @xmath10 creates a fermion of momentum @xmath11 and spin projection @xmath12 or @xmath13 , @xmath14 is an af ordering vector , @xmath15 is the electron - pair degeneracy , and following refs .",

    "@xcite we discussed the representation structure of ( [ eq2 ] ) and showed that the @xmath7 subgroup is associated with antiferromagnetism , the @xmath23 subgroup is associated with @xmath3-wave superconductivity , and the @xmath1 subgroup is associated with a transitional symmetry interpolating between the other two . in this paper",
    ", we further provide the full mathematical justification for interpreting the @xmath1 subgroup as a symmetry interpolating dynamically between sc and af phases .",
    "it is convenient to take as the generators of @xmath24 the new combinations @xmath25 where @xmath26 generates the @xmath27 factor and is associated with charge density waves ( do not confuse this @xmath22 factor with the one appearing in eq .",

    "@xcite , the operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 are associated with @xmath3-wave pairs , and @xmath34 is the charge operator .",
    "because of the direct product structure @xmath35 , we can without loss of generality analyze the @xmath18 structure in terms of its subgroup @xmath0 , with the @xmath36 factor considered separately .",

    "2 that if @xmath107 is near @xmath132 ( half filling ) , @xmath173 ; this corresponds to af order , since the staggered magnetization reaches its maximum , @xmath174 , and there are no pairing or @xmath1 correlations ( @xmath175 ) . with the onset of hole doping ,",

    "before @xmath112 vanishes at the critical doping @xmath172 ( @xmath176 ) , the system has an energy surface almost flat for broad ranges of @xmath76 , implying the presence of large - amplitude fluctuations in af order ( and equivalently in sc order )",
    ". meanwhile , the @xmath1 correlation @xmath134 increases and reaches its maximum at the doping where the pairing and af correlations become equal to each other ( see figs .",
    "2c and 2d ) .",
    "this is the underdoped sc region .",
    "the coexistence of these three correlations competing with each other is consistent with the complexity and variety of experimental phenomena in this region .      for small values of @xmath107 ( @xmath177 ) ,",
    "the stable point is @xmath178 .",
    "this corresponds to sc order , since both the af and @xmath1 correlations vanish ( @xmath179 ) , and only the pairing correlation remains ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the critical doping @xmath169 is the optimal doping point since @xmath133 is maximum at @xmath169 and decreases as hole - doping increases .",
    "thus the doping range @xmath177 may be considered to be the overdoped region .",
    "the critical doping @xmath169 depends on the ratio of the pairing and the @xmath181 strengths ( see eq .",
    "( [ cdoping ] ) ) .",
    "the larger the pairing strength @xmath182 relative to the @xmath168 strength @xmath183 in eq .",
    "( [ cdoping ] ) , the smaller the critical doping value @xmath169 .",
    "from the above discussion one can see that , with a perturbed @xmath1 symmetry , the system can undergo phase transitions from the af order at half filling to the sc order at smaller filling as particle number varies .",
    "this picture is at least qualitatively consistent with the observations .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry breaking in the hamiltonian ( @xmath121 larger than @xmath185 ) is crucial .",
    "only when @xmath1 is broken does the energy surface interpolate between af and sc order as doping is varied ( compare the surfaces for @xmath186 and @xmath171 in figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that high temperature superconductivity may be described by a hamiltonian that conserves @xmath0 but breaks ( explicitly ) @xmath1 symmetry in a direction favoring af order over sc order",
    ".    the deviation from the @xmath1 symmetry need not be large .",
    "experimentally , it is known that the optimal doping @xmath187 is around 0.16 , suggesting that @xmath188 ( note that @xmath189 ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath190 according to eq .",
    "( [ cdoping ] ) , which is formally quite close to the @xmath1 symmetry limit .",
    "however , it should be stressed that because of the critical nature of the @xmath1 symmetry , a slightly perturbed @xmath1 hamiltonian may have solutions that are close to the other symmetry limits of the @xmath0 model for particular electron occupation ratios , even though the hamiltonian itself is not formally in any of the dynamical symmetry limits .",
    "for example , one can see from figs .  2c and 2d",
    "that the hamiltonian near half filling actually behaves like an @xmath7 hamiltonian since it effectively contains only the @xmath125 correlation term ( @xmath125 is the primary component of the @xmath7 casimir ) .",
    "likewise the perturbed @xmath1 hamiltonian approximates the @xmath6 hamiltonian containing only the @xmath167 term when @xmath177 ( see figs 2c and 2d ) . only in the intermediate doping range ( @xmath191 ) , where both @xmath167 and @xmath125 correlations have significant contributions ,",
    "does the @xmath171 hamiltonian behave like an approximate @xmath1 hamiltonian , as it should formally .",
    "in particular , near the region where the @xmath167 and @xmath125 terms have equivalent contributions and the @xmath1 correlations ( the operator @xmath134 ) reach their maximum , the @xmath171 solution lies very close to the @xmath1 symmetry limit , as one would expect .",
    "the present analysis implies that the underdoped regime is naturally associated with the @xmath192 dynamical symmetry interpolating between antiferromagnetic and superconducting order .",
    "likewise , optimally doped and overdoped superconductors are naturally associated with the @xmath193 dynamical symmetry and af insulators near half filling are associated with the @xmath194 dynamical symmetry ( or small perturbations around these symmetries ) .    as we shall discuss in a separate publication @xcite ,",
    "the appearance of pseudogap behavior @xcite can be described , and much of the quantitative phase diagram in cuprates can be reproduced rather well @xcite , if a fixed hamiltonian with slightly broken @xmath1 symmetry but preserving @xmath0 overall symmetry is adopted .",
    "this again supports our interpretation of @xmath1 symmetry as an critical dynamical symmetry .",
    "the small @xmath1 symmetry breaking distorts the completely flat energy surface at half filling to stabilize af character in the system ; the critical nature of the @xmath1 dynamical symmetry ( that the system interpolates between two phases ) remains .",
    "the present paper serves to introduce into the condensed matter literature the technology of generalized coherent states . as we have shown in the example discussed here ,",
    "these methods provide a systematic way to relate a many - body theory to its approximate broken symmetry solutions .",
    "this approach may be viewed as a standardized technology for constructing energy surfaces for many - body theories defined in terms of the algebra of their second - quantized operators , or equivalently as the most general bogoliubov transformation permitted , subject to a symmetry constraint on the hamiltonian of a system .    to illustrate the power of these techniques , we have used generalized coherent states to understand the relationship between the @xmath0 model of superconductivity @xcite and the zhang @xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "the use of @xmath0 coherent states to analyze the energy surface of its @xmath1 subgroup permits us to interpret the @xmath1 as a critical dynamical symmetry that interpolates between af and @xmath3-wave sc order as doping is varied , and suggests similarities with analogous critical dynamical symmetries well known from nuclear structure physics .",
    "this permits the @xmath1 symmetry to be understood dynamically as a critical phase that , for a range of doping , has an energy surface extremely soft against af fluctuations and therefore having much of the character of a spin glass ( or possible stripe phases in the presence of a spatially modulated perturbation ) .",
    "thus , the coherent state analysis suggests that @xmath1 is the appropriate symmetry of the underdoped regime , but that the af phase at half filling and the optimal and overdoped sc phases are described by two other @xmath0 subgroups : @xmath7 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the coherent state analysis also shows clearly that the requirement of small deviations from @xmath1 symmetry and the necessary doping dependence of the solutions that are inserted in the zhang model occur naturally when @xmath1 is a subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we note that the results obtained here may have some broader implications .",
    "although the present application is specifically to the high - temperature superconductor problem , we may anticipate that these mathematical techniques could find use for any application in condensed matter physics where it is important to understand the relationship between an exact many - body theory and the order parameter(s ) characterizing its approximate broken symmetry solutions .",
    "clearly there are many such possibilities .",
    "finally , the concept of a critical dynamical symmetry that we have introduced here in a condensed matter context is one that has already found important application in other areas of physics .",
    "this implies that there may be deep algebraic analogies between various condensed matter systems and superficially different systems appearing in other fields of many - body physics .",
    "we have suggested one such analogy here between the physics of high - temperature superconductors and the physics of collective states in heavy atomic nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0 model employs 16 generators closed under commutation that define the @xmath18 lie algebra and a corresponding @xmath18 group .",
    "in addition to the three components of staggered magnetization and two for @xmath3-wave pairing , there are three spin operators , one charge operator , six spin-1 operators analogous to the zhang @xmath195 operators , and one operator that may be interpreted as generating charge density waves .",
    "the @xmath18 group has the subgroup @xmath196 , where the @xmath22 factor may be identified with charge density waves .",
    "thus , because of the direct product structure , one can without loss of generality view the theory as an @xmath0 theory describing superconductivity and antiferromagnetism , and global charge and spin conservation , with the @xmath22 charge - density wave sector treated independently ( but the overall group structure implies that the lowest states of the symmetry - limit theory have no charge- density wave excitations ) .",
    "charge density waves are forbidden in the unbroken - pair subspace with exact @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "a relaxation of the exact symmetry or breaking pairs can lead to charge density wave excitations in a more realistic theory .",
    "however , the clear tendency of the @xmath0 symmetry is to suppress charge density waves in the lowest - lying states ."
