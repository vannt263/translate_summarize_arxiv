    "<S> a mechanical break junction is formed using a notched gold wire mounted on metal shim - stock . </S>",

    "<S> these measurements are performed under ambient conditions at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> first we consider the `` dc '' portion of the measurement circuit . to determine the conductance , a function generator sources an offset square wave of desired amplitude so that the applied voltage oscillates between zero and a set value , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this voltage is passed into the junction via the `` dc '' input of a bias - tee . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the square wave is typically below 10  khz , a bound set by the properties of the bias - tee used to deliver the voltage to the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the other side of the junction is connected through a current - limiting resistance standard ( general radio 1433-g decade resistor ) to a keithley 428-prog current amplifier . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance standard is used to avoid overloading the current amplifier input stage when the junction is in a fully shorted high conductance configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the output of the current amplifier is measured using a lock - in amplifier synchronized to the input square wave , with a typical lock - in output time constant of @xmath171  ms .    </S>",
    "<S> the shot noise measurement relies on the high frequency response of the circuit , which is very different from that at dc . </S>",
    "<S> the bias - tees play a crucial role here . </S>",
    "<S> the side of the junction that is biased at dc via the function generator is terminated at 50  @xmath18 at high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , at high frequencies the other bias - tee isolates the other side of the junction from the resistance standard and the current preamplifier . instead </S>",
    "<S> , that side of the junction is coupled via an extremely short ( few cm ) piece of 50  @xmath18 coaxial cable directly to the input of the rf amplifier chain with a nominal gain of @xmath1770  db , followed by filters that define a nominal bandwidth extending from 250 to 520  mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the rf signal is then passed to a power meter with an output proportional to the logarithm of the incident rf power . </S>",
    "<S> the output of this rf power meter is detected using a second lock - in amplifier also synchronized to the input square wave , with a lock - in output time constant of @xmath171  ms .    </S>",
    "<S> note that one can not think of the rf circuit in quasi - dc terms , with the resistance of the junction and the stray capacitance forming an rc divider that suppresses all high frequency response . </S>",
    "<S> instead one must consider the junction as a source of mean square current fluctuations , @xmath19 , in parallel with some characteristic impedance , @xmath20 , determined by resistive and reactive components . </S>",
    "<S> as explained in the supporting information , one end of the junction is terminated at 50  @xmath18 , and the terminated junction acts as an equivalent noise source with an effective impedance @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this `` generator '' is then connected to a very short piece of @xmath22 transmission line to a nominally 50  @xmath18 amplifier chain . while _ maximal _ </S>",
    "<S> power transfer would require @xmath23 , power is still delivered to the amplifier chain even when there is an impedance mismatch . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath24 , the power transferred to the amplifier chain is approximately @xmath25 . at any given frequency within the nominal bandwidth of the rf system , one can measure the effects of the impedance mismatch by measuring the reflection properties of the junction . ideally one wants to do this simultaneously with data acquisition , across the whole bandwidth , but that is not practical , and that data is acquired separately .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this approach is capable of measuring shot noise in a system with a high dc impedance , provided the rf properties are calibrated . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we have use the same amplifier system to measure the shot noise produced by a vacuum photodiode . </S>",
    "<S> the photodiode cathode is biased through a bias - tee to -45  v using a dc power supply , while the rf port of the cathode bias - tee is terminated at 50  @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the anode is connected through the dc terminal of a bias - tee to the current amplifier and subsequent lock - in . </S>",
    "<S> the rf port of the anode bias - tee is then connected to the amplifier chain . a light - emitting diode ( led ) </S>",
    "<S> is driven by the square wave output of a function generator to illuminate the photodiode . </S>",
    "<S> the current amplifier measures the ( quasi - dc when led is on ) photocurrent . </S>",
    "<S> the rf amplifier chain amplifies the noise power , which is then measured by the power meter . </S>",
    "<S> lock - in detection ( synced to the led illumination ) is then used to find the noise power produced by the photocurrent .    </S>",
    "<S> depending on illumination level , the dc differential resistance of the vacuum photodiode around the operating point ranges from 28 to 205  m@xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the rf properties of the photodiode rather than this dc resistance determine the power transfer of the shot noise to the amplifier chain . </S>",
    "<S> as described in the supporting information , a reflectometry measurement of the cathode - terminated photodiode from the anode side is sufficient to characterize this power transfer , via a frequency - dependent reflection coefficient , @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> conversion of the measured noise power into units of current noise per unit bandwidth requires knowledge of both @xmath27 and the gain - bandwidth product , @xmath28 , of the amplifier chain . </S>",
    "<S> an rf source is cycled through 1000 evenly spaced frequencies , @xmath29 , from 1  mhz to 1  ghz , feeding an input power , @xmath30  dbm , into the amplifier chain . </S>",
    "<S> the output of the amplifier chain , @xmath31 is recorded at each frequency , as is the background , @xmath32 output with @xmath33 set to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the gain - bandwidth product is then computed by numerical integration : @xmath34 a separate measurement of @xmath35 of the photodiode at each frequency ( see supporting information ) allows us to correct @xmath28 for the division of power between the photodiode and the amplifier chain . </S>",
    "<S> the measured noise power is then divided by this corrected gain - bandwidth product to infer the power noise per hz delivered to the amplifier chain . </S>",
    "<S> finally this is then divided by the input impedance of the first stage amplifier , 50  @xmath18 , to obtain the current noise per hz produced by the photodiode . </S>",
    "<S> as shown , this noise scales linearly with the photocurrent , with a slope of @xmath36 amps / hz . </S>",
    "<S> this compares well with expectations , deviating from the expected @xmath37 by less than 3% . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the rf approach can successfully measure shot noise , even though the dc resistance of the photodiode is much greater than 50  @xmath18 .    in the break junction case , </S>",
    "<S> lock - in detection of the rf power is crucial , since at 300  k the nyquist - johnson equilibrium noise is significant . neglecting quantum effects </S>",
    "<S> , the nyquist - johnson current noise of a 1  @xmath15 conductor at 300  k is @xmath38  a@xmath39/hz , while ( for @xmath7 ) the current shot noise at a dc current of 1  @xmath40a would be @xmath41  a@xmath39/hz . without lock - in detection , the shot noise would barely be detectable above the thermal noise at a dc bias voltage exceeding 100  mv . </S>",
    "<S> even with phase - sensitive detection there is some background rf noise power even at @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> this background is strongly reduced when great care is taken on shielding extraneous interference . while the logarithmic power meter allows noise measurements over a large dynamic range , it is particularly sensitive to background noise , compared with a linear power detector . </S>",
    "<S> as we discuss further below , lock - in detection of the noise power avoids contributions from the _ equilibrium _ thermal noise ; however , heating and resultant temperature changes due to the applied dc bias would be detected in this approach . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the measured noise power is likely a combination of shot noise and bias - induced - heating changes in the nyquist - johnson noise . </S>",
    "<S> an additional possible contribution due to @xmath0 `` flicker '' noise will be discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> the reflection coefficient measurement is considerably more challenging for the break junction case . in principle </S>",
    "<S> one would like to measure @xmath35 at frequencies across the rf bandwidth on - the - fly . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , one can acquire histograms of @xmath35 as a function of @xmath43 at a series of discrete frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> doing this densely across the whole frequency range of interest is laborious and difficult . </S>",
    "<S> measurements indicate ( see si ) that at individual frequencies , @xmath35 is essentially independent of @xmath43 for conductances between @xmath44 and 5  @xmath15 . in the break junction data presented here we choose to plot the noise in `` arbitrary units '' , accepting that our incomplete knowledge of @xmath45 constitutes a systematic error ( independent of @xmath43 from 0.5 to 5 @xmath15 ) in the overall magnitude of the noise .    </S>",
    "<S> conductance and noise data are recorded simultaneously as the junction is brought into and out of contact , using a daq system to sample the lock - in outputs at @xmath171k samples / s . </S>",
    "<S> histograms of the measured conductance values are compiled in real time during junction breaking and formation . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , running averages of the noise power are computed for each conductance bin . the data analysis is entirely automated , with no post - selection of `` nice '' traces . in general , conductance histograms were cleaner , with more observable conductance quanta , during junction breaking rather than formation .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] shows an example data set , acquired at room temperature over the course of several hours . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance histogram clearly shows peaks at approximately 1 , 2 , and 3  @xmath15 , as expected from previous work on au junctions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from perfect quantization at integer multiples are seen in some samples , but are always quantitatively consistent with previous measurements on au junctions at room temperature in the presence of work hardening@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged noise power distribution shows significant dips in power centered at precisely the conductance values associated with peaks in the histogram . </S>",
    "<S> this noise suppression is very similar to that seen by van den brom _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. at liquid helium temperatures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the suppression is not expected to reach all the way to @xmath46 , since statistically junctions with @xmath47 may be formed in many ways , with many possible combinations of @xmath9 for different channels .    </S>",
    "<S> as described by van den brom and van ruitenbeek@xcite , one can construct an explicit model of the expected shot noise by assuming a form for the contributions of different conductance channels as a function of conductance . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely to be reasonable only in the small number of channels limit . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4]a shows such a model , while fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b plots the corresponding expected shot noise , based on eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : shotnoise ] ) , for different magnitudes of dc ( square - wave ) bias . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations assume a temperature of 300  k , and take into account that the actual voltage dropped across the junction is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the resistance standard , approximately 6  k@xmath18 for the measurements in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] and [ fig4]c .    </S>",
    "<S> there is considerable interest in comparing data sets taken at different junction biases . </S>",
    "<S> higher biases enable possible inelastic processes such as optical phonon scattering , and there are theoretical predictions@xcite ( particularly in molecular junctions@xcite ) that such processes can modify the fano factor away from the prediction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : shotnoise ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic processes can also lead to unconventional fano factor values@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b assumes no such modifications .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4]c shows averaged measured noise power as a function of conductance for the same @xmath16 magnitudes as in the model of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b . </S>",
    "<S> no background subtraction has been performed , and as above no correction has been made to the noise data to account for the dependence of @xmath35 of the junction on the conductance .    </S>",
    "<S> comparison between the model and the data reveals several features of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the overall trend at high conductances toward lower noise with increasing @xmath43 is expected due to the resistance standard : when @xmath50 , the dc current approaches @xmath51 , and the dc voltage , @xmath52 , relevant for eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : shotnoise ] ) becomes small because most of the applied dc voltage is dropped across the resistance standard . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation of the data from the model at low conductances ( @xmath53 ) is not surprising , given the sensitivity of that data to the reflection coefficient resulting from the impedance mismatch between the junction and the amplifier chain .    </S>",
    "<S> one must be concerned about contributions to the data due to @xmath0 noise . in electronic conduction </S>",
    "<S> this noise results from temporal fluctuations of the resistance , with a broad distribution of characteristic timescales@xcite . this noise has been shown to exist in metal contacts approaching the atomic scale@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> static conductance fluctuations as a function of dc bias voltage across nanojunctions are known to be suppressed near quantized conductance values@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable that the time - dependent conductance fluctuations that give rise to @xmath0 noise could be similarly affected by the decreased backscattering and increased junction stability near quantized conductance values . to test for this physics </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the dependence of the measured noise on the dc current through the junction . at a given @xmath43 , </S>",
    "<S> conductance fluctuation noise is expected to be _ </S>",
    "<S> quadratic _ in the dc current , in contrast to shot noise . </S>",
    "<S> we do not see strong signatures of such a dependence , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]d , finding that the measured noise is roughly linear in dc current , extrapolating toward a finite background value at zero current . </S>",
    "<S> there is some nonlinearity , however , meaning that some contribution from @xmath0 noise can not be completely ruled out .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of noise suppression at room temperature demonstrates explicitly the quantum character of transport in these atomic - scale devices . </S>",
    "<S> inelastic processes such as electron - phonon scattering can remove energy from the `` hot '' electron system and redistribute electrons between the different quantum channels . </S>",
    "<S> this is what leads to the suppression of shot noise in macroscopic conductors at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these data suggest that such inelastic processes operate on length scales longer than the single - nanometer junction size , even at 300  k and biases in the tens of mv range .    </S>",
    "<S> an additional contribution to the superlinearity seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]d that must be considered is bias - driven local electronic heating of the junction </S>",
    "<S> . such heating would be synchronous with the bias current , and thus would be detected in the lock - in technique . </S>",
    "<S> bias - driven ionic heating has been inferred in such junctions previously by studying the bias - dependence of the junction breaking process@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been noted that effective temperature changes in robust junctions can reach several hundred kelvin at biases of a few hundred mv@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite explicitly suggest using measurements of the noise as a means of detecting local , nonequilibrium heating in atomic - scale contacts . </S>",
    "<S> detailed modeling of the local junction temperature is complicated by the fact that local joule heating and effective thermal path are explicit and implicit functions , respectively , of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> such modeling is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be examined carefully in a later publication .    </S>",
    "<S> this technique raises the possibility of performing rapid assays of shot noise through molecules , given the great progress that has been made in recent molecular break junction conductance measurements . as mentioned above , </S>",
    "<S> both electron - vibrational effects and magnetic processes are predicted to modify fano factors away from @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> such low conductance junctions have , necessarily , very poor impedance matching to the usual 50  @xmath18 rf electronics used in the noise measurements . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is great interest in examining noise in such systems at much lower bias currents . </S>",
    "<S> improved coupling of junction noise power to the amplifiers and reduced backgrounds would be a necessity . </S>",
    "<S> impedance matching networks or tank circuits may provide a means of adapting this approach to the molecular regime , though not without a likely reduction in bandwidth .    </S>",
